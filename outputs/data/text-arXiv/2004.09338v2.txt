Understanding the temporal dynamics of COVID-19 patient phenotypes is necessary to derive finegrained resolution of pathophysiology. Here we use state-of-the-art deep neural networks over an
institution-wide machine intelligence platform for the augmented curation of 15.8 million clinical
notes from 30,494 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR diagnostic testing. By contrasting the
Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived clinical phenotypes of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos, n=635)
versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg, n=29,859) patients over each day of the week preceding the
PCR testing date, we identify anosmia/dysgeusia (37.4-fold), myalgia/arthralgia (2.6-fold), diarrhea
(2.2-fold), fever/chills (2.1-fold), respiratory difficulty (1.9-fold), and cough (1.8-fold) as significantly
amplified in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The specific combination of cough and diarrhea has
a 3.2-fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with
anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19 (4-7 days prior to
typical PCR testing date). This study introduces an Augmented Intelligence platform for the realtime synthesis of institutional knowledge captured in EHRs. The platform holds tremendous
potential for scaling up curation throughput, with minimal need for retraining underlying neural
networks, thus promising EHR-powered early diagnosis for a broad spectrum of diseases.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by the novel Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of April 28, 2020, according to WHO there have
been nearly 3 million confirmed cases worldwide and more than 200,00 deaths attributable to COVID-19
(https://covid19.who.int/). The clinical course and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 varies substantially,
even among patients with similar age and comorbidities1. Following exposure and initial infection with
SARS-CoV-2, likely through the upper respiratory tract, patients can remain asymptomatic although active
viral replication may be present for weeks before symptoms manifest1,2. The asymptomatic nature of initial
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the majority of patients may be exacerbating the rampant community transmission
observed3. It remains unknown which patients become symptomatic, and in those who do, the timeline of
symptoms remains poorly characterized and non-specific. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, myalgias,
loss of appetite, loss of smell (anosmia), and altered sense of taste, in addition to the respiratory symptoms
of dry cough, dyspnea, sore throat, and rhinorrhea, and well as gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea,
nausea, and abdominal discomfort4. A small proportion of COVID-19 patients progress to severe illness
requiring hospitalization or intensive care management; among these individuals, mortality owing to Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is higher5. The estimated average time from symptom-onset to
resolution can range from three days to more than three weeks, with a high degree of variability6. The
COVID-19 public health crisis demands a data science-driven and temporal pathophysiology-informed
precision medicine approach for its effective clinical management.

Here we introduce a platform for the augmented curation of the full-spectrum of patient phenotypes
from 15,775,993 clinical notes of the Mayo Clinic EHRs for 30,494 patients with confirmed positive/negative
COVID-19 diagnosis by PCR testing (see Methods). The platform utilizes state-of-the-art transformer
neural networks on the unstructured clinical notes to automate entity recognition (e.g. diseases, drugs,
phenotypes), quantify the strength of contextual associations between entities, and characterize the nature
of association into positive, negative, or other sentiments. We identify specific gastro-intestinal, respiratory,
and sensory phenotypes, as well as some of their specific combinations, that appear to be indicative of
impending COVIDpos diagnosis by PCR testing. This highlights the potential for neural networks-powered
EHR curation to facilitate a significantly earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 than currently thought feasible.

Results
The clinical determination of the COVID-19 status for each patient was conducted using the SARSCoV-2 PCR (RNA) test approved for human nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens under
the U.S. FDA emergency use authorization (EUA)6. This PCR test resulted in 14,695 COVIDneg patient
diagnoses and 635 COVIDpos patient diagnoses. In order to investigate the time course of COVID-19
progression in patients, we used BERT-based deep neural networks to extract symptoms and their putative
synonyms from the clinical notes for a few weeks prior to, and a few weeks post, the date when the COVID19 diagnosis test was taken (see Methods; Table 1). For the purpose of this analysis, all patients were
temporally aligned, by setting the date of COVID-19 PCR testing to ‘day 0’, and the proportion of patients
demonstrating each symptom derived from the EHR over each day of the week preceding and post PCR
testing was tabulated (Table 2). As a negative control, we included a non-COVID-19 symptom ‘dysuria’.
Altered or diminished sense of taste or smell (dysgeusia or anosmia) is the most significantly
amplified signal in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients in the week preceding PCR testing (Table 1; 37.4-fold
amplification; p-value = 2.9E-187). This result suggests that anosmia and dysgeusia are likely the most
salient early indicators of COVID-19 infection, including in otherwise asymptomatic patients.
In the COVIDpos patients, diarrhea is significantly amplified in the week preceding PCR testing
(Table 1; 2.2-fold; p-value = 3.9E-16). Some of these undiagnosed COVID-19 patients that experience
diarrhea may be unintentionally shedding SARS-CoV-2 fecally7. Incidentally, epidemiological surveillance
by waste water monitoring conducted recently in the state of Massachusetts observed copious SARS-CoV2 RNA8. The amplification of diarrhea in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients in the week preceding PCR
testing highlights the importance and necessity for washing hands often.
Respiratory difficulty is enriched in the week prior to PCR testing in COVIDpos over COVIDneg
patients (1.9-fold amplification; p-value = 1.1E-22; Table 1). Among other common phenotypes with
significant enrichments in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients, cough has a 1.8-fold amplification (p-value =
9.3E-25), myalgia/arthralgia has a 2.6-fold amplification (p-value = 2E-24), and fever/chills has a 2.1-fold
amplification (p-value = 1.3E-36). Rhinitis is also a potential phenotype of COVIDpos patients that requires
some consideration (1.9-fold amplification, p-value = 1.3E-07). Conjunctivitis, hemoptysis, and respiratory
failure have too few COVIDpos patients currently for them to be statistically meaningful enrichments, but
these phenotypes are worth tracking (Table 1). Finally, dysuria was included as a negative control for
COVID-19, and consistent with this assumption, 0.94% of COVIDpos patients and 0.93% of COVIDneg
patients had dysuria during the week preceding PCR testing.
Next, we considered the 351 possible pairwise conjunctions of 27 phenotypes for COVIDpos versus
COVIDneg patients in the week prior to the PCR testing date (Table S1). As expected from the above results,
altered sense of smell or taste (anosmia/dysgeusia) dominates in combination with many of the above
symptoms as the most significant combinatorial signature of impending COVIDpos diagnosis (particularly
along with cough, respiratory difficulty, fever/chills). Examining the other 325 possible pairwise symptom

2

combinations, excluding the altered sense of smell of taste, reveals other interesting combinatorial signals.
The combination of cough and diarrhea is noted to be significant in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients during
the week preceding PCR testing; i.e. cough and diarrhea co-occur in 12.4% of COVIDpos patients and in
3.9% of COVIDneg patients, indicating a 3.2-fold amplification of this specific symptom combination (BH
corrected p-value = 4.0E-17, Table S1).
We further investigated the temporal evolution of the proportion of patients with each symptom over
the week prior to PCR testing (Table 2). Altered sense of taste or smell, cough, diarrhea, fever/chills, and
respiratory difficulty were found to be significant discriminators of COVIDpos from COVIDneg patients
between 4 to 7 days prior to PCR testing. During that time period, cough is amplified in the COVIDpos patient
cohort over the COVIDneg patient cohort with an amplification of 3.9-fold (day -7, p-value = 1.4E-09), 4.33fold (day -6, p-value = 1.8E-12), 2.6-fold (day -5, p-value = 3.9E-04), and 2.2-fold (day -4, p-value = 8.4E03). The intriguing diminishing odds of cough as a symptom from 7 to 4 days preceding the PCR testing
date, suggests this may be a notable temporal pattern. Likewise, diarrhea is amplified in the COVIDpos
patient cohort over the COVIDneg patient cohort with an amplification of 3.2-fold (day -7, p-value = 4.1E-04),
3.0-fold (day -6, p-value = 6.3E-04), 1.9-fold (day -5, p-value = 1.0E-01), and 1.2-fold (day -4, p-value =
6.8E-01). Similarly, fever/chills is also enriched in the COVIDpos patient cohort over the COVIDneg patient
cohort with 5.1-fold (day -7, p-value = 1.3E-12), 5.1-fold (day -6, p-value = 7.3E-15), 3.1-fold (day -5, pvalue = 2.2E-05), and 2.6-fold (day -4, p-value = 5.7E-04) amplifications. Respiratory difficulty is likewise
enriched in day -7 (3.7-fold, p-value = 4E-07), day -6 (3.8-fold, p-value = 2.9E-08), and day -5 (2.7-fold, pvalue = 4.4E-04) among the COVIDpos patient cohort. Temporally subsequent to the enriched odds of
diarrhea, cough, fever/chills, and respiratory difficulty, we find that change in appetite/intake is amplified in
the COVIDpos cohort over the COVIDneg cohort on day -4 (6.3-fold, p-value = 2.2E-08), day -3 (6.0-fold, pvalue = 5.7E-08), and day -2 (4.6-fold, p-value = 5.9E-06). These observations characterize the temporal
evolution of specific phenotypes that are enriched in COVIDpos patients, preceding and succeeding their
PCR testing date.
While explicit identification of SARS-CoV-2 in patients prior to the PCR testing date was not
conducted, such prospective validation of our augmented EHR curation approach is being initiated.
Nevertheless, this high-resolution temporal overview of the EHR-derived clinical phenotypes as they relate
to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostic testing date for 30,494 patients has revealed specific enriched signals
of impending COVID-19 onset. These clinical insights can help modulate social distancing measures and
appropriate clinical care for individuals exhibiting the specific gastro-intestinal (diarrhea, change in
appetite/intake), sensory (anosmia, dysgeusia) and respiratory phenotypes identified herewith, including
for patients awaiting conclusive COVID-19 diagnostic testing results (e.g. by SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR).

Discussion
In order to identify potential cells and tissue types that may be associated with the EHR-derived
clinical phenotypes observed above for COVID-19 patients, we analyzed Single Cell RNA-seq data using
the nferX platform (see Methods)9. Given recent studies implicating the necessity of both ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 for the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle10, we scouted for human cells that co-express both genes. This
co-expression analysis revealed that specific cell types from the small intestine/colon, nasal cavity,
respiratory system, pancreas, urinary tract, and gallbladder co-express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Figure
1, Figure S1). Notably, multiple small intestine cell types co-express the two genes. These cell types include
enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, stem cells, goblet cells, and Paneth cells. In the pancreas, the cell types
included ductal cells and acinar cells. The kidney cells co-expressing TMPRSS2 and ACE2 include proximal
tubular cells, pelvic epithelial cells and type A intercalated cells. Co-expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 is
also observed in the epithelial cells of the olfactory nasal cavity and the respiratory tract as well as in type

3

II pneumocytes (albeit at comparatively lower level). While the identified tissues showing co-expression of
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the gastro-intestinal, respiratory, and sensory systems correlate with the clinical
phenotypes of early COVID-19 infection as described above, these insights are conceivably from
normal/healthy tissues. This highlight the need for meticulous bio-banking of COVID-19 patient-derived
biospecimen and their characterization via single cell RNA-seq and other molecular technologies.
Primary prevention is the most effective method to minimize spread of contagious infectious viruses
such as SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S2). In addition to population-based strategies such as social distancing,
there are significant ongoing efforts to develop a prophylactic solution (Table S2). As the immunodominant
humoral immune response in patients is directed against the SARS-CoV2 spike protein, many vaccines
under investigation target this viral protein. It remains to be determined whether anti-spike protein
antibodies induced by natural infection or by vaccines induce neutralizing antibody responses. Chloroquine
and its analogues have been shown to inhibit virus replication in-vitro28. Whether Chloroquine or
Hydroxychloroquine have meaningful effects of SARS-CoV2 replication in patients remains to be
understood, and are the subject of clinical trials, both as post-exposure prophylaxis and as treatment (Table
S2). Hydroxychloroquine was approved by FDA for emergency use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who
are not eligible for clinical trials on April 7, 2020 based on limited clinical data, but concerns have been
raised about toxicity and risk of sudden death29.
Our findings from the EHR analysis of COVID-19 progression can aid in a human pathophysiology
enabled summary of the experimental therapies being investigated for COVID-19 (Figure 2, Table S2).
Some of the earliest phases of intervention attempt to inhibit the entry/replication of SARS-CoV-2 by
modulating critical host targets (e.g. renin angiotensin aldosterone system/RAAS inhibitors, ACE2 analogs,
serine protease inhibitors) or directly inhibiting the function of viral proteins (e.g. viral RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, convalescent plasma, synthetic immunoglobulins) (Box 1, Table
S3). In patients with more advanced stages of disease progression, who suffer from respiratory
abnormalities, therapeutics are being advanced to target the inflammatory response that can lead to Acute
Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS) and is associated with high mortality (Box 1). These include antiGM-CSF agents, anti-IL-6 agents, JAK inhibitors, and complement inhibitors. Another emerging option for
patients at this stage is convalescent plasma, which has shown some clinical benefits in cases of COVID19 and related viral diseases (SARS-1, MERS) at various stages of severity (Box 1). Administration of
convalescent plasma containing active specific antiviral antibodies may prevent or attenuate progression
to severe disease. Expanded access to convalescent plasma for treatment of patients with COVID-19 has
been approved by the FDA for emergency IND use and is available through a nationwide program led by
Mayo Clinic (Box 1).
In those who become symptomatic, it is imperative that diagnostic testing is done, at dedicated
testing sites if available, to confirm diagnosis (Figure S2). Meanwhile, patients are recommended to selfquarantine at home, use mask protection when social distancing cannot be obtained, and continue
supportive measures. For patients with mild symptoms, such measures may be sufficient given the selflimited nature of viral syndromes. In the event of symptom exacerbation, often marked by worsening
respiratory distress, medical evaluation is warranted, and possible hospitalization. The mainstay of
treatment for COVID-19, remains supportive care, and as needed supplemental oxygen. Experimental
therapies intended to block SARS-CoV2 viral entry and inhibit steps in the viral life cycle necessary for viral
replication have been proposed at this early stage (Figure 2). The goal of these therapies is to reduce viral
load, thus reducing the chance of overwhelming immune reaction by delaying progression of the disease.
Among the proposed treatment options for COVID-19, corticosteroid should be avoided outside a
clinical trial, as suggested by the IDSA, until further clinical evidence can be established
(www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/covid-19-guideline-treatment-and-management). This is because
there has been conflicting evidence and guidance on steroid use in COVID-1930. While steroids can play a

4

role in control of inflammation, a collection of clinical evidence from steroid use in other coronavirus
outbreaks suggest that the use of corticosteroids might exacerbate COVID-19-associated lung injury31.
As patients progress to severe or critical diseases, the primary objective of COVID-19 management
is to provide respiratory support and control immune overactivation (Figure 3, Figure S3). Patients whose
condition deteriorates to critical status primarily decompensate from a respiratory standpoint, but may also
develop multi-organ failure (respiratory failure, cardiac failure, renal failure, hypercoagulable state,
thrombotic microangiopathy), as well as severe inflammatory responses similar to cytokine release
syndrome and eventually reactive hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome. A major manifestation
of respiratory decompensation and cytokine release syndrome is acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). Critical care support such as mechanical support from noninvasive to invasive mechanical
ventilation and in, some instances, extracorporeal support, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy,
anticoagulation, and are paramount to survival of these critically ill patients per SCC guidelines
(SCCM/ESICM 2020). On the other hand, drugs such as immunomodulatory agents often used to treat
cytokine release syndrome, may allow for some degree of improvement or recovery either leading into or
during severe and critical disease (Figure 2).
This study demonstrates how the highly unstructured institutional knowledge can be robustly
synthesized using deep learning and neural networks32. We started by leveraging a BERT-based deep
neural network that was trained on ~18500 sentences containing 250 different phenotypes and symptoms
related to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and cardiopulmonary diseases. We found that the model was
translatable to the COVID-19 context, achieving an overall 92.7% true positive rate (see Methods and
Table S5 for variations across symptoms). While these results speak to the scalability of our deep learningbased approach to teaching machines how to read and comprehend de-identified clinical text, rigorous
statistical assessments of neural network performance across disease areas will be essential to further
advancing diagnostic applications for clinical care.
Expanding beyond one institution’s COVID-19 diagnostic testing and clinical care to the EHR
databases of other academic medical centers and health systems will provide a more comprehensive view
of clinical phenotypes enriched in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients in the days preceding confirmed
diagnostic testing. This requires leveraging a privacy-preserving federated software architecture that
enables each medical center to retain the span of control of their de-identified EHR databases, while
enabling the machine learning models from partners to be deployed in their secure cloud infrastructure.
Such seamless multi-institute collaborations over an Augmented Intelligence platform that puts patient
privacy and HIPAA-compliance first, is being advanced actively over the Mayo Clinic’s Clinical Data
Analytics Platform Initiative (CDAP). The capabilities demonstrated in this study for rapidly synthesizing
over 8.2 million unstructured clinical notes to develop an EHR-powered clinical diagnosis framework will be
further strengthened through such a universal biomedical research platform.
A caveat of relying solely on EHR inference is that mild phenotypes that may not lead to a
presentation for clinical care, such as anosmia, may go unreported in otherwise asymptomatic patients.
However, the augmented curation approach described here allows for the active monitoring of all such
symptoms as they emerge in the EHR; this may accelerate the identification of novel disease
symptomatology. As a case in point, the CDC recently expanded its list of possible symptom indicators of
COVID-19 to include new loss of taste or smell, headache, muscle pain, and repeated shaking with chills
(www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). As awareness of these
symptoms grows, we expect their presence in the EHR to also grow, making statistical enrichment
observations, such as those presented here, more robust. Another salient consideration is that as serologybased tests for COVID-19 with high sensitivity and specificity are approved, testing will become more
aggressive and “day 0” as defined in the present work will likely occur earlier in the COVID-19 illness course.
Additionally, as at-home serology-based testing is advanced, capturing symptoms that precede clinical

5

testing will become increasingly important in order to facilitate the continued development and refinement
of disease models; EHR-integrated digital health tools may help address this need. Finally, as multiple
COVID-19 testing approaches are pursued and patients begin to receive multiple tests of different types, it
will be important to leverage EHR curation tools to assess false positive rates of early serology testing and
to gain insight into and optimize test sequencing.
As we continue to understand the diversity of COVID-19 patient outcomes through holistic inference
of EHR systems, it is equally important to invest in uncovering the molecular mechanisms and gain
cellular/tissue-scale pathology insights through large-scale patient-derived biobanking and multi-omics
sequencing. As the anecdotal single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) based co-expression analysis of ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 on normal human samples conducted here highlights, the rich heterogeneity of cell types
constituting various host tissues can be investigated in great detail by scRNA-seq. To correlate patterns of
molecular expression from scRNA-seq with EHR-derived phenotypic signals of COVID-19 disease
progression, a large-scale bio-banking system has to be created. Such a system will enable deep molecular
insights into COVID-19 to be gleaned and triangulated with SARS-CoV-2 tropism and patient outcomes.
Ultimately, connecting the dots between the temporal dynamics of COVIDpos and COVIDneg clinical
phenotypes across diverse patient populations to the multi-omics signals from patient-derived bio-specimen
will help advance a more holistic understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology. This will set the stage for a
precision medicine approach to the diagnostic and therapeutic management of COVID-19 patients.

BOX 1
Experimental therapies targeting entry and
replication of SARS-CoV-2
RAAS inhibitors and ACE2 analogs: One class of
experimental therapies intended to inhibit viral entry
and early disease in COVID-19 includes Renin
Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors
and recombinant ACE2 (Table S2). ACE2 is the
primary host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, while serine
protease TMPRSS2 is implicated in the spike protein
priming after viral binding10. Recombinant ACE2 has
been proposed as an early COVID-19 therapy based
on in-vitro data11. At this time, the effect of RAAS
inhibitors is uncertain in the context of COVID-19.
Studies have investigated how ACE expression is
modulated by coronavirus infection, and how that
relates to lung injury11. Trials are ongoing with
Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) for treatment
of COVID-19 by diminishing downstream harmful
effects of angiotensin receptor activation (Figure 2).
Serine Protease inhibitors: Given the TMPRSS2
involvement in viral entry (Figure 2), serine protease
inhibitors such as Camostat are now under evaluation
in trials and should also be considered in the early
stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors:
Of these, Remdesivir, a nucleoside analog, has
attracted much attention for in-vivo inhibition of SARSCoV-2, and a recent observational study of 53 patients
who received Remdesivir under compassionate use
found that 68% of patients demonstrated improvement
in respiratory status after a 10 day regimen12. Another
nucleoside analog, Galidesivir, is also under
evaluation in patients. Yet another viral replication
inhibitor in clinical trials is Favipiravir (Figure 2).
Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum viral RNA dependent
RNA polymerase inhibitor that is shown to have in-vivo
activity against a wide range of RNA viruses. In one
RCT of 240 patients, Favipiravir was found to improve
the clinical recovery rate of COVID-19 relative to
Umifenovir, a viral entry inhibitor13 (Table S2).

HIV Protease inhibitors: This class of medication is
widely proposed and used off-label based on
postulates that HIV and HCV proteases share
structural similarities with those of SARS-CoV-214. Of
these, Lopinavir/Ritonavir (combination) has shown
promise but was found to have a non-significant
benefit in a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) of 199
patients in China15, while Darunavir has shown no
significant activity against SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro (Table
S2)16. Multiple randomized, controlled clinical trials are
now underway in the USA to determine efficacy of
these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19.
Other Antiviral Agents: Another emerging option for
patients at this stage is convalescent plasma (Figure
2), which has shown clinical benefits in cases of
COVID-1917 and related viral diseases (SARS-1,
MERS) at various stages of severity18,19.
Administration of convalescent plasma containing
specific antiviral antibodies may prevent or attenuate
progression to severe disease. Expanded access to
convalescent plasma for treatment of patients with
COVID-19 is available through a program led by Mayo
Clinic20. Synthetic hyperimmune globulins are also
under development and evaluation.

Agents being advanced that target the
inflammatory response in COVID-19
Anti-GM-CSF agents -- A xenograft study found that
granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) neutralization with Lenzilumab significantly
reduced production of inflammatory cytokines21,
offering evidence for efficacy of anti-GM-CSF agents
in prevention of CART-induced cytokine release
syndrome (CRS). Lenzilumab has been approved by
the FDA for emergency IND use for CRS in COVID-19,
while others such as Mavrilimumab and Gimsilumab
aimed at controlling undesired inflammation from
myeloid activation will be evaluated in clinical trials.

Anti-IL-6 agents: IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine,
regarded as a driver of CRS22 (Figure 2A-C). A recent
report suggests IL-6 as a biomarker for respiratory
failure in COVID-1922. As such, anti-IL-6 agents
including Tocilizumab, Sarilumab, and Siltuximab are
being evaluated in randomized trials (Table S2) and
used off-label in severe COVID-19 patients.
Tocilizumab was approved for the treatment of CRS in
2017. An observational study of 21 patients with severe
COVID-19 pneumonia treated with Tocilizumab
showed promising results23,24.
Anti-JAK agents: A number of immunomodulatory
agents not linked to CRS are also under trial for COVID19 (Figure 2). Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as
Baricitinib, Fedratinib, and Ruxolitinib, indicated for
Rheumatoid Arthritis and Myelofibrosis, have been
tested in xenograft models for Chimeric Antigen
Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy induced CRS25.
Ruxolitinib is available under an expanded access
program in USA for severely ill COVID-19 patients
(Table S1) and trials are underway in other countries.
Anti-Complement agents: A recent study found that
SARS-CoV-2 also binds to MASP2, a key driver of the
complement
activation
pathway,
leading
to
complement hyperactivation in COVID-19 patients26.
Inhibitors of the terminal complement pathway such as
Eculizumab have been tried in individuals with
improvements observed after administration in China.

Agents targeting ventilation/perfusion
defects in COVID-19-induced ARDS
Vasodilators: A recent report based on 16 cases in
Italy and Germany noted that, contrary to the
established understanding in ARDS, COVID-19
patients in ARDS retain relatively high lung
compliance27 and demonstrate ventilation/perfusion
defects likely arising from perfusion dysregulation and
hypoxic vasoconstriction. Therefore, patients with
COVID-19 in ARDS may benefit from vasodilators to
address this pathophysiologic mechanism. A trial is
underway in China for use of inhaled nitric oxide in
patients with mechanical ventilation (Table S2).

Methods
Augmented curation of EHR patient charts
The nferX Augmented Curation technology was leveraged to rapidly curate the charts of SARSCoV-2-positive patients. First, we read through the charts of 100 patients and identified and grouped
symptoms into sets of synonymous words and phrases. For example, “SOB”, “shortness of breath”, and
“dyspnea”, among others, were grouped into “shortness of breath”. We did the same for diseases and
medications. For the SARS-CoV2-positive patients, we identified a total of 26 symptom categories (Table
S4) with 145 synonyms or synonymous phrases. Together, these synonyms and synonymous phrases
capture a multitude of ways that symptoms related to COVID-19 are described in the Mayo Clinic Electronic
Health Record (EHR) databases.
Next, for charts that had not yet been manually curated, we used state-of-the-art BERT-based
neural networks32 to classify symptoms as being present or not present based on the surrounding
phraseology. The neural network used to perform this classification was trained using nearly 250 different
phenotypes and 18,500 sentences; it achieves over 96% recall for positive/negative sentiment classification
(Table S6). We went through individual sentences and either accepted the sentences or rejected and
reclassified them. The neural networks were actively re-trained as curation progressed, leading to stepwise
increases in curation efficiency and model accuracy. In Step 1 of this process, we labeled 11433 sentences,
8737 of which were labeled as either ‘present’ or ‘not present.’ The model trained on this data set (90%10% training/test split) achieved F1 scores of 0.93 and 0.84 for ‘present’ and ‘not present’ classifications,
respectively. The model was then applied to an additional 3688 sentences in Step 2, rapidly corrected by
a human for classification errors and re-trained to generate a newer version of the model. Step 3 was an
iteration of step 2 on an additional 3369 sentences. The model achieved F1 scores of 0.96/0.91 after step
2 and 0.96/0.96 after step 3 for the classification of ‘present’/’not present.’ Due to the augmented nature of
this approach, steps 2 and 3 required successively less input from the human annotator.
This model was applied to 15,775,993 clinical notes across 635 COVIDpos patients and 29,859
COVIDneg patients. First, the difference between the date on which a particular note was written and the
PCR testing date of the patient corresponding to that note formed the relative date measure for that note.
The PCR testing date was treated as ‘day 0’ with notes preceding it assigned ‘day-1’, ‘day-2’ and so on.
BERT-based neural networks were applied on each note to provide a set of symptoms that were present
at that point of time for the patient in question. This map was then inverted to determine for each symptom
and relative date the set of unique patients experiencing that symptom.
Because the model had not yet encountered many COVID-19-related symptoms (Table S4), we
performed a validation step in which the classifications of 4000 such sentences from the timeframe of
highest interest (day 0 to day -7) were manually verified. Sentences arising from templates, such as patient
education documentation, accounted for 10.2% of sentences identified. These template sentences were
excluded from the analysis. The true positive rate (TPR), defined as the total number of correct
classifications by the model divided by the number of total classifications, achieved by the model for
classifying all symptoms was 92.7%; the corresponding false positive rate (FPR) was 13.4%. The model
achieved true positive rate (TPR) ranging from 91% to 100% for the major symptom categories of
Fever/Chills, Cough, Respiratory Difficulty, Headache, Fatigue, Myalgia/Arthralgia, Dysuria, Change in
appetite/intake, and Diaphoresis. Classification performance was lower for Altered or diminished sense of
taste and smell; here, the true positive rate was 64.4%. Detailed statistics are displayed in Table S5.
For each synonymous group of symptoms, we computed the count and proportion of COVIDpos and
COVIDneg patients that were deemed to have that symptom in at least one note between 1 and 7 days prior
to their PCR test. We additionally computed the ratio of those proportions which indicates the extent of

7

prevalence of the symptom in the COVIDpos cohort as compared to the COVIDneg cohort. A standard 2proportion z hypothesis test was performed, and a p-value was reported for each symptom.
To capture the temporal evolution of symptoms in the COVIDpos and COVIDneg cohorts, the process
described above was repeated considering counts and proportions for each day independently.
Pairwise analysis of phenotypes was performed by considering 351 phenotypic pairs from the
original set of 27 individual phenotypes. For each pair, we calculated the number of patients in the COVIDpos
and COVIDneg cohorts wherein both phenotypes occurred at least once in the week preceding PCR testing.
With these patient proportions, a Fisher exact test p-value was computed. Benjamini-Hochberg correction
was applied to account for multiple hypothesis testing.
This research was conducted under IRB 20-003278, “Study of COVID-19 patient characteristics
with augmented curation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) to inform strategic and operational decisions”.
All analysis of EHRs was performed in the privacy-preserving environment secured and controlled by the
Mayo Clinic. nference and the Mayo Clinic subscribe to the basic ethical principles underlying the conduct
of research involving human subjects as set forth in the Belmont Report and strictly ensures compliance
with the Common Rule in the Code of Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46) on Protection of Human Subjects.
Analysis of cell-types expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 using single cell RNAseq
Since the successful entry of virus in the cell requires priming by cellular host protease – TMPRSS2,
we hypothesized that cells that express both TMPRSS2+ and ACE2+ cells could harbor SARS-CoV-2
during the course of infection. Thus, we probed for the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in all the singlecell studies from human tissues available on the nferX Single Cell platform (https://academia.nferx.com/).
For all the tissues that we profiled, we ensured that there is a minimum of 100 cells in the cell population
and that there is a minimum of 1% of the cells in the cell population co-expressing (non-zero expression)
both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression.

types co-expressing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity determinants ACE2 and TMPRSS2 determined by single cell
RNA-seq are mapped onto the COVID-19 pathophysiology summary.
Figure 2. Pathophysiology of COVID-19, associated treatments, and the underlying molecular
mechanisms. While there is no established treatment strategy for COVID-19, several classes of
therapeutics have emerged for the medical management of the disease, on the basis of their known
mechanisms of action and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.

Table 1. Augmented curation of the unstructured clinical notes from the EHR reveals specific clinically
confirmed phenotypes that are amplified in COVIDpos patients over COVIDneg patients in the week prior to the
SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing date. The key COVIDpos amplified phenotypes in the week preceding PCR testing (i.e. day
= -7 to day = -1) are highlighted in gray (p-value < 1E-10). The ratio of COVIDpos to COVIDneg proportions represents
the fold change amplification of each phenotype in the COVIDpos patient set (phenotypes are sorted based on this
column). Phenotypes highlighted with a superscript (*) are still rare in COVIDpos patients at this time, thus mitigating
their statistical significance.

Figure S1. Cell-types connected to pathophysiology of COVID-19 as inferred from high expression
of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human scRNA seq datasets. A scatter plot depicting the expression of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 inferred from the single-cell RNA-seq profiling of human tissues using nferX single cell
platform. The x-axis represents the mean ln(cp10k+1) expression of ACE2 in all the cells and the y-axis
represents the mean ln(cp10k+1) expression of TMPRSS2 in the corresponding cell-types from respective
tissues. The colors on the scatter plot depicts the tissue origins. The size of the points on the scatter plot
represents the percentage of single cells in the cell-type that co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (non-zero
expression).

Figure S2. Disease progression of COVID-19 can be divided into multiple stages, and appropriate
therapeutics can be chosen based on the specific pathophysiological mechanisms. Using nferX
Knowledge Synthesis, the most associated molecular markers at each step of disease progression are also
identified (see Supplementary Methods for details on nferX knowledge synthesis). In order to capture
biomedical literature based associations, the nferX platform defines two scores: a “local score” and a “global
score”, as described previously (Park, J. et al. Recapitulation and Retrospective Prediction of Biomedical
Associations Using Temporally-enabled Word Embeddings. doi:10.1101/627513).
