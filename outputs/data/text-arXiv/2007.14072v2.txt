Lockdown procedures have been proven successful in mitigating the spread of the viruses in this
COVID-19 pandemic, but they also have devastating impact on the economy. We use a modified
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased model with time dependent infection rate to simulate
how the infection is spread under lockdown. The economic cost due to the loss of workforce and
incurred medical expenses is evaluated with a simple model. We find the best strategy, meaning the
smallest economic cost for the entire course of the pandemic, is to keep the strict lockdown as long
as possible.

INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic of corona virus disease (COVID) first identified in
Wuhan, China, in December 20191 . As of 20 July 2020,
more than 14.6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19
have been reported globally2 . The virus is mainly
spread between healthy and infected people during close
contact, most often through small droplets produced
by coughing, sneezing, and talking1 . Thus maintaining
proper physical distance from other people, keeping
good indoor ventilation, and wearing a face mask3 in
public places should be effective4 in reducing the spread
of the virus. People may also get infected by touching
a contaminated surface and then touching their face.
Regularly disinfecting surfaces in public places and
keeping the habit of hand washing for everyone should
also curb COVID-19 infection.
Lockdown refers to the adoption of strict rules imposed by the local government to decrease individual
mobility and increase physical distancing, sometimes
accompanied by mandatory use of masks or other personal protective equipment in public places. Based on
the studies of mobile phone tracking done in China6 and
Italy7 , the effectiveness of lockdown in controlling the
spread of the virus depends on how strict the lockdown
procedures are implemented. With a tighter lockdown,
sufficient low mobility does bring down transmission
below the level needed to sustain the epidemic7 . As
vaccine against COVID-19 is currently not available8 ,
lockdown remains to be one of the proven effective
approach18 for curbing the spread of infection, especially
if contact tracing9,10 were not likely to be done efficiently.
However these lockdown measures also come with many
serious economic impacts, especially for the low income
households11 , along with some social and psychological
tensions within the populations12,13 . How to strike the
balance between controlling the spread of the virus and
maintain social economic stability becomes the key issue
for navigating out the crisis brought by this pandemic.
Some countries, such as Sweden and South Korea, have
not fully locked down14 , and its success15 depends on

efficient contact tracing and massive tests to identify and
quarantine those who are infected. Frequent random
testing16 may also help to avoid complete lockdowns.
In the event of major outbreak, the large amount of
infected people would make contact tracing ineffective
against the spread of infection17 , and some forms of
locked down seems to be the most effective approach to
curb the spread of infection.
The goal of this paper is to find the optimal timing,
in the sense of lowest economic cost for the entire
course of the pandemic, for easing the strict lockdown.
Less stringent controls are required following the end
of the strict lockdown to temporarily end the pandemic. We model the pandemic using the simplest
compartment model19 called Susceptible-InfectiousRecovered-Deceased (SIRD) model with time dependent
infection rate to simulate the effect of lockdown. The
economic cost during the pandemic is vastly simplified
to include only two parts: the economic cost due to the
loss of available workforce and lockdown regulations,
and the medical expenses for the infected. Based on
this model study, in a three-stages scenario staring with
natural spread, followed by strict lockdown, and finally
less stringent lockdown, the best strategy is to keep the
strict lockdown as long as possible. Three countries,
U.S.A., Italy, and China, are selected to see if indeed
the longest strict lockdown, which is indeed good for
temporarily stopping the pandemic, is also good for
the economy. The changes in their quarterly GDP21
seems to suggest that is correct, but no clear indication
suggests this from their unemployment rate data20 .
More detailed comparisons in different economic indexes
should be made.
There are several existing literatures discussing
economic trade-offs and optimal policy analysis within
the SIR framework22–29 , or its extension such as
SEIR30,31 (E stands for ”exposed”), or other more
sophisticated compartment models32,33 . Other than
these so called equations based approach, agent based
model of COVID-19 epidemic34–37 , which takes more
computational efforts, is also applied on these issues. A

2
nice relevant literature review can be found in Ref. 32.
Most of the studies support strict and long lockdown as
advocated by this paper. The main difference between
this work and others is that the end of pandemic
defined here (for evaluation of economic cost during the
pandemic) is not the real ending of the pandemic. That
is, the herd immunity is not discussed in this model
study. The reason is that, without sufficient study
on the duration of immunity and reliable vaccines for
this virus, it would inevitably cost many more lives,
as briefly discussed in section III, to achieve the herd
immunity.
New lifestyles of epidemic prevention38
should be followed during the post pandemic time.
This paper is organized in the following way. In the
section II, we introduce a slightly modified SIRD model
and a simple model for economic cost due to the pandemic and lockdown. In the section III, economic costs
for different duration of lockdown are evaluated with
simplified time dependent infection rate. Results are
summarized in the Table I. More realist time dependent
infection rate for three countries (U.S.A., Italy, and
China; data collected up to July 9th, 2020) and some of
the associated economic cost are shown in the section
IV. In the section V we summarize our results, and
comment on the limitations of the studies done in this
paper.

MODEL DISCUSSION

evaluated by the fatality rate in the region we discuss,
and is related to the medical resources available in that
region during this pandemic.
We use a naive model to describe the economic impact
brought by the lockdown. Gross domestic product per
capita at nominal values or gross domestic product per
capita at purchasing power parity of the country/region,
labeled indiscriminately as GDP hereafter, is treated
as the average economic output contributed by a
healthy person (which includes susceptible and recovered ones). The influence of the lockdown procedures
on the economic output is modeled by a productivity
decrease function Lα (t) with 0 ≤ Lα (t) ≤ 1. That is,
Lα (t) × GDP × N (S(t) + R(t)) is the economic output
contributed by the healthy people within the total
population N at some time t. Lα (t) can be modeled
by some empirical economic data, and it should vary
significantly for different type of work or region we are
interested in. For example, the tourism, restaurant, and
public transport are probably strongly influenced by the
lockdown, while the business related to online transactions such as stock trading are much less influenced.
Here we model Lα (t) = (β(t)/β(0))α by treating this
economic output, on average, relying on the human to
human contact as in the SIRD model with 0 ≤ α ≤ 1.
α = 0 is used for the business pattern where no actual
human contact is required (such as online lectures), and
α = 1 is used for the business pattern where human
contact is crucial (such as traditional factories, tourisms,
cultural performances, etc.).

To model the pandemic for some number of population
N , we use a slightly modified SIRD model39 , incorporating the loss of lives when the infection rate goes above
some ”medical threshold”. The equations describing the
ratio of susceptible S(t), currently infected I(t), the recovered ones R(t), and the deceased ones D(t) are given
by:

At the same time, the economic cost for taking care of
the infected is given by M E×N I(t) where M E stands for
the average medical expenses per person. The economic
cost at time t due to the lockdown and the additional
cost on the medical treatment is then given by:


GDP × N 1 − L(t) S(t) + R(t) + M E × N I(t) (2)

dR(t)
= γ(t)I(t),
dt
dD(t)
= η(t)I(t)Θ(I(t) − Im ).

(1)

From Eq.(2) we note that the crucial factor is M E/GDP
as the value of GDP and N are assumed to be fixed
(time independent) in this model. If M E/GDP ≫ 1
then it would be wiser to keep the infection rate I(t)
as low as possible, at the expense of slower lifting of
the lockdown. If M E/GDP ≃ 1 then an early lifting of
the lockdown (which does not mean going completely
back to the usual normal life!) might be better for the
economic benefit of general public.

Here β(t) is a time dependent infection rate, which
decreases from some maximal value set by the nature
of the virus to positive number close to zero if very
strict lockdowns were imposed. γ(t) is the recovery rate
given by the average time it takes for the infected one to
recover from this disease. η(t) is a time dependent death
rate, and Θ(x) is the Heaviside step function being 1
when x ≥ 0 and 0 otherwise. Parameter Im can be

first wave of the pandemic (defined here as I(T ) ≃ I(0),
the initial infection ratio, without clear signature of
resurgence of the pandemic after some time), and t = 0
is the start of this pandemic. In between we may have
two special points in this time frame: the time to start
the lockdown, and the time for easing or lifting of the
lockdown, denoted as sl T and el T respectively. It follows

3
that 0 < sl < el ≤ 1.

SIMPLIFIED SCENARIOS

For the simplified scenarios, we treat the influence
of imposing or lifting the lockdown on the β(t) by
an abrupt change in its value. Other parameters are
simplified to be time independent, with γ(t) = γ = 0.1,
η(t) = η = 0.03, and Im = 5 × 10−5 . During the
hard (strict) lockdown the β(t) is fixed at ln(1.02),
and for the post lockdown period the β(t) is fixed at
ln(1.09). Before the lockdown is imposed, the β(t) is
fixed at ln(1.4), corresponding to the natural spreading rate of the virus. The ”end” of this (first wave
of) pandemic is defined as the ratio of the active cases
lowered to its initial value, which is set to be I(0) = 10−6 .
This, however, does not really mean the life can go back
to completely normal as setting the β(t) back to ln(1.4)
at arbitrary later time will cause a second wave of major
outbreak. One such example is shown in the Fig.1 with
the second outbreak occurs after around 20 days of going
back to completely normal. This demonstrates the importance of new lifestyles of epidemic prevention without
herd immunity during the post pandemic time. These
new lifestyles include, but not limited to, the wearing of
face masks at the crowded public places, washing hands
regularly, border quarantine, and quick response to trace
and isolate possible sources of community infection. All
these efforts are made to control the β(t) to be below a
critical value γ(t)/S(t), so that there is no second wave
of the pandemic. In the model parameters mentioned
here, this critical β(t) ≃ ln(1.105) since the majority of
the population are not infected. That is, the susceptible
ratio S(t) is still close to 1 (the largest active case ratio,
or the peak of I(t) in the Fig.1 is 3.3 × 10−4 during the
first pandemic).
The only exception to the above statement is when
herd immunity is achieved when a large portion of
a community becomes immune to the COVID-19.
Without available vaccination, this herd immunity could
possibly be achieved when nothing is done to prevent
the spread of the infection. For the parameters given
above with β(t) fixed at ln(1.4) all the time, we find this
pandemic officially ends at t = 223 (no possible second
wave). On this day 20.83% of the population is dead
due to this virus, with about 9.64% of the population
still susceptible and about 69.53% of the population
recovered with immunity. Apparently this high ratio
of mortality is not what we want, and some forms of
lockdown or quarantine measures are needed before
effective vaccine is available to lower the number of
deaths due to this virus.

145 < t, and β(t) = ln(1.02) for 25 < t ≤ 145. I(t) drops

the pandemic, we integrate Eq.(2) with respect to time
(with three stage β(t) mentioned in the last paragraph)
and set GDP × N to be 1 for simplicity. Different α
are used for L(t) in the Eq.(2) to simulate the different
impacts on different business. In the Table I, we listed
α = 1, 0.1, and 0.01 cases with three different strict lockdown time (el − sl )T = 30, 45, and 60 days. We choose
M E/GDP = 13 in this calculation, but we shall bear
in mind that this number could vary significantly even
over different regions in the same country. As losses of
human life are very personal and difficult to estimate economically, we choose Im = 5 × 10−5 on purpose in this
simplified scenarios to let the mortality rate in all three
cases to be the same. The mortality rate is defined as
the total number of deaths divided by the population N
after the pandemic is over, or

mortality rate ≡ 1 − S(T ) + I(T ) + R(T ) = D(T )
The choice of Im can be understood from Fig.2, which
shows the daily active rate I(t) as a function of time
t. The inset shows the original (linear) scale, and the
main figure is plotted with the semi-log scale which helps
to illustrate the exponential growth/suppression more
clearly. I(t) is suppressed more strongly for I(t) >
5 × 10−5 (the slope in the semi-log, or d ln(I(t))/dt, is
more negative). For t > 45 (or after 20 days of strict
luckdown) I(t) has already dropped below Im , and therefore in all three cases (with all t > 55) we discuss here
the mortality rate is the same.
In the Table I, we list the ending day of the pandemic
T otal
T , the economic cost from day 1 to T (labeled as Ecost
),
and the economic cost from day 1 to t = 90 (labeled as

with three different α values mentioned above.
The mortality rate, shown at the bottom of the table,
in all three cases are kept at 0.01%. The fatality rate,

The fatality rate is listed in the 5th row of the Table I.
From the row atop the bottom of Table I, we see that
longer lockdown makes the fatality rate slightly higher
(around 18% for 60 days lockdown compared with 15%
for 30 days). This is because the total number of people
infected is larger for shorter lockdown with fixed number
of deaths in our model.
From the second row of Table I, we see that the end
of this first wave of pandemic depends crucially on how
long this strict lockdown lasts. Two months of strict
lockdown (with T = 119 days) leads to the ”end of the
tunnel” after 34 days of easing the lockdown, while one
month of strict lockdown (with T = 262 days) needs
additional 143 days (or 4 more months) to see this. In
fact, for 65 days of strict lockdown the active cases ratio
I(t) drops below 10−6 as mentioned in the caption of the
Fig.1. This shows that longer strict lockdown effectively
shortens the total time for the pandemic and decreases
the total number of infected people.

here is very small).

with a large differences in economic cost compared with
90days
for a given α. These results show that the
Ecost
short strict lockdown is indeed good for the economy
in the short term, but bad for the economy in the long
run in our simple model. This statement is true for
all businesses, as represented by three different α here,
having negative impact (or positive economic cost here)
from the pandemic.
Based on the simplified scenarios, the best strategy for
reducing the economic impact seems to be prolonging the
strict lockdown until the end of the pandemic. However,
aforementioned analysis does not include the problem
of bankruptcy for the businesses severely impacted
by the lockdown. For example, the largest economic
max
cost Ecost
, for some company modeled by α = 1, is
max
= 55. For economic cost beyond this
set to be Ecost
value, the company would go bankruptcy and causing
unemployment problems. So the employers and/or
employees of the company would surely favor lifting the
strict lockdown as soon as possible. This yearning for
shorter lockdown is explained in the following paragraph.
In the simplified scenarios, the company can survive in
90days
max
the short term (i.e. Ecost
> Ecost
) if the strict lockdown is short (say, (el − sl )T = 30). It goes bankruptcy
for longer lockdown (such as (el − sl )T = 45, 60) within
90 days. Thus the owners or some employees of the
company would favor lifting the strict lockdown as early
as possible, without knowing that shorter lockdown
actually brings even
more cost in the long run. That
max
T′
is, Ecost
< Ecost
for some 90 < T ′ < T even for
(el − sl )T = 30 case. The best strategy for the company
then is to keep the strict lockdown as long as it can,
and how long the company may survive under the

5
max
lockdown crucially depends on Ecost
. To have longer
max
survival time, the company needs to increase Ecost
with the help from banks (lowering interests rate) and
timely government subsides, and to modify the business
patterns to lower its α value (changing the in person
meetings to online ones, for example). Some passenger
airplanes having been modified to serve as cargo planes
in some airlines is one good example of lowering the α
value in the airline business.

In short, ”the more haste, the less speed” or ”haste
makes waste” accurately depicts the shortcomings of the
hasty lifting of the lockdown. During this pandemic we
shall ”overcome impetuosity and exercise patience, and
go steady so we can go far”. Let us use the modified
SIRD model described in the Eq.(1) to study more realistic cases, and compare the lockdown procedures and
timings between these cases in the following section. The
methods used to obtain the parameters β(t), γ(t), η(t),
and Im in this modified SIRD model are introduced in
the beginning of the next section.

with some mathematical function βf (t), and part of the

constant on β̃(t) to get β(t), and choose other parameters to be time independent, i.e. γ(t) = γ, η(t) = η.
In the U.S.A. case presented here, β(t) − β̃(t) = 0.0053
is chosen, so that the daily new cases obtained in this
modified SIRD model, plotted as dashed purple line
in the inset of Fig. 3, is roughly consistent with that
obtained from the SI model (blue thin line in the same
figure). The parameters γ, η, and Im are chosen by requiring the total confirmed case, the active (or currently
infected) cases, the recovered, and the deceased ratio to
be roughly consistent41 with the actual data at the last
day (t = 122 in this U.S.A. case) of the data set.
Following aforementioned methods, we find that
β(t) − β̃(t) = 0.0053, γ = 0.006, η = 0.0022, and
Im = 1 × 10−5 giving rise to the total confirmed case,
the active cases, the recovered, and the deaths ratio
for the U.S.A. up to July 9th. These computed results
are plotted as thin blue line, dashed purple line, thick
brown line, and dot dashed green line in the Fig.4 and
Fig.5. These two figures show the same results with
different scale (linear for Fig.4 and logarithmic for Fig.
5) on the vertical axes. The logarithmic scale plot Fig.5
shows more clearly the onset of recovered and death
ratio, which is around 13 and 17 days after the onset of
the active cases respectively. The actual data40 happens
to be the reverse of the two, i.e. the onset of recovered
ratio is around 17 days and that of death ratio is around
13 days. This discrepancy reflects that the actual death
rate η and recovery rate γ are time dependent41 , possibly
reflecting the shortage of sufficient medical resources in
the beginning of the pandemic. As we mainly focus on
the timing of lifting the strict lockdown in this article,
we stick with the choice of parameters similar to the
simplified scenarios mentioned in the last section. That

is no national-wide lockdown imposed by the federal
government43 in the U.S.A., perhaps due to some
legal issues44 . Many states did have imposed some
shelter-in-place rules or state-wide stay at home order
starting in late March (t ≃ 20 in Fig.3-5), affecting
94% of the country’s population at the peak of the
lockdown based on the report of Business Insider43 .
Starting around the end of April, many states had lifted
the lockdown or restrictions with multiple stages. For
the states taking more cautious steps for reopening,
such as New York and New Jersey (both with major
reopening around late May/early June, or around t ≃ 80
in Fig.3-5), have successfully reduced the spread of the
coronavirus and flatten the epidemic curve, while for
some states like Arizona, Florida, and Louisiana, have
seen rapid increase in the daily new confirmed cases40 .
This effectively changes the curve of the national-wide
daily new cases, as shown in the inset of Fig.3, and
prolongs the duration of this COVID-19 pandemic.
One aspect of the economic impact due to this
pandemic can be judged by the monthly unemployment
rate20 . The unemployment rate increases from 3.5% on
February 20 to 4.4% on March 20 (t ≃ 10), and jumps to
14.7% on April 20 (t ≃ 40). After the lifting of lockdown
in late April, the unemployment rate drops down continuously to 13.3% in May and 11.1% in June. The sudden
increase of monthly unemployment rate is roughly
captured by the economic cost 1 − L(t)(S(t) + R(t)) with
α = 1 case, as shown in the Fig.6. This α = 1 curve
reaches maximum at t ≃ 95 (as is expected from the
βf (t) in Eq.(4)), so the simple economic cost function
proposed here does not give the correct timing for the
drop in unemployment rate.
For Italy and China, the monthly unemployment rate
is not completely available on the Internet. So we fo-

The lockdown in Italy started from March 9th, and
ends on May 18th45 . The starting and ending day
corresponds to t ≃ 20 and t ≃ 86 in Fig.7 and Fig.8.
It started in Northern Italy, but later expanded to the
whole of Italy a day later. The lockdown measures
implemented by Italy was considered the most radical
ones46 except those implemented by China47 . The active
cases has dropped down consistently from its peak value
(at around t = 53 in Fig.7).
Italy’s current emergency rules remain in place until
at least the end of July. The current measures include

plot Fig.10 shows more clearly the onset of recovered
and death ratio, which is around 6 and 19 days after the
onset of the active cases respectively. This is roughly
consistent with the actual data40 with the onset of
recovered and death ratio around 11 and 20 days after
the onset of the active cases.
The lockdown in China started from January 23, with
partial lifting on 19 March49 , and ends on April 8th
for Wuhan50 . The starting and ending day corresponds
to t ≃ 1 and t ≃ 75 in Fig.9 and Fig.10. It started
in Wuhan city in Hubei, China, but later expanded to
many parts of China later. From Fig.10 we see that the
pandemic stops at around t = 110. The actual data40
actually shows the pandemic stops at around 86 days
from the onset of the pandemic.

countries, China has the longest lockdown time and
strictest lockdown regulations52. It turns out to be the
most effective one for ending the pandemic, but the
strict regulations may endanger the human rights53 and
pose negative psychological impact54 .

The next question would be that if this longer, stricter
lockdown does do good for the economy, as is suggested
in the simplified scenarios. The answer to that is not
clear, as we need more transparent data for making a fair
comparison. The second quarterly (Q2) GDP21 in China
rebounded to 3.2% growth from a record 6.8% contraction in the previous (Q1) quarterly GDP (announced on
April 17 for Q1 and July 16 for Q2). Q1 GDP in the
U.S.A.21 shrank 5%, following the 2.1% growth in Q4
last year (announced on June 25 for Q1 and March 26
for last year’s Q4). Q1 GDP in Italy21 shrank 5.3%, following the 0.3% contraction in Q4 last year (announced
on May 29 for Q1 and March 4 for last year’s Q4). The
Trading Economics forecast21 for Q2 of U.S.A. and Italy
are −27% and −13.2%, respectively. If the forecast were
correct, then this trend in the quarterly GDP suggests
longer, stricter lockdown might indeed be beneficial for
the overall economy.

FIG. 10: Semi-logarithmic scale for China cases v.s. time (up
to July 9th,2020).

The reason why the lockdown in China was imposed
on t ≃ 1 rather than t ≃ 20 as in Italy and U.S.A. might
have to do with the Wuhan as the ground zero (in the
sense of the first city for large scale cluster infection)
of coronavirus pandemic51 . The actual infected number
might be much larger than the confirmed (reported)
ones as the number of available testing initially was not
sufficient. Also the majority of the cases were reported
in Wuhan, and by the time of imposing the lockdown on
t = 1 the infected number is also around 100 people per
million if we treat all reported cases in Wuhan and thus
the denominator is the population of Wuhan (around 11
million) instead of China. This amount of population
ratio is similar to the ones in the U.S.A. and Italy (c.f.
Fig.5 and Fig.8).

Comparison of three cases

Aforementioned three cases happen to roughly illustrating three cases in the Table.I. Among the three

In this paper we treat the effect of lockdown as
changing the values of time dependent infection rate
β(t) in the SIRD model described in the Eq.(1). Other
parameters γ(t) and η(t) are kept to be time independent to simplify the calculation. Combining the
obtained results with a naive economic cost function
described in Eq.(2), we compute the economic cost
for the entire course of lockdown and economic cost
after 90 days (counting from the beginning of the
pandemic) in simplified scenarios, where β(t) changes
discontinuously during different stages of lockdown. The
results, summarized in Table.I, suggest that long strict
lockdown is the most beneficial approach for economy
in the long run, even with the same number of deaths
due to the pandemic55 . More realistic computations
for β(t) are done in the section.IV for U.S.A., Italy,
and China, and their respective economic indicators
during this pandemic are discussed. Quarterly GDP
seems to suggest the conclusion reached in the simplified
scenarios, but the monthly unemployment rate does not
support that.
The epidemic model we adopted is the simplest compartment model19 , so the proper comparison with the
model predictions should be done at smaller scale (such
as county or city) with few external traffic flows (so that
the population roughly maintains a constant) instead of
countries mentioned in the section.IV. However, other
than some states in the U.S.A., there are not many
regional data/information available on the internet

9
for this COVID-19 pandemic. Given the simplicity of
the epidemic model mentioned in Eq.(1) and proposed
phenomenological economic cost function in Eq.(2), it
is easy to adapt the relevant parameters to determine,
from data and the model prediction56 , when would be
the proper time to ease the lockdowns57, with proper
inter-city or inter-regional quarantine measures, at
some local community. Another merit of Eq.(2) is that
company facing financial crisis may predict the possible
losses based on the current trend of its financial data,
as the calculation done in the Fig.6, and ask for timely

absence of antibodies59 . More time dependent studies
on both the relevant antibodies and T cells shall shed
light on the issue of how effective the vaccination would
be. Another important issue not discussed in fixed population compartment model studies is about the international travel post the COVID-19. A combination of flow
models60,61 or network models62 with the compartment
model can be applied to determine the optimal ways for
easing the regulations on the international travel during
the post pandemic time.

Last but not least, most of the compartment model
studies, including this one, assumes that the recovered
people are immune to the virus. However the concentration of associated antibodies seems to decrease with time
after recovered from this COVID-1958 . This does not
necessarily mean that long term immunity is not possible for COVID-19 as T cells may fight coronavirus in

More realistically, shortening the strict lockdown prolongs
the duration of the pandemic. This also leads to increase
of number of deaths (as can be checked by requiring Im =
0), leading to even larger loss in the simple economic cost
function described in the Eq.(2).

and some mathematics. This is the reason I started to work
on this project near the beginning of April. At the same
time I also convinced a group of undergraduate students to
switch from solid state physics study club (Steve Simon’s
book) to the compartmental models in epidemiology. Their
report will be published elsewhere.
