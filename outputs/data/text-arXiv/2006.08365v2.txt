Abstract
The relationship between pandemic and human mobility has received considerable attention
from scholars, as it can provide an indication of how mobility patterns change in response to
a public health crisis or whether reduced mobility contributes to preventing the spread of an
infectious disease. While several studies attempted to unveil such relationship, no studies
have focused on changes in human mobility at a finer scale utilizing comprehensive, highresolution data. To address the complex association between pandemic’s spread and human
mobility, this paper presents two categories of mobility datasets—trip mode and trip
purpose—that concern nearly 10 million citizens’ movements during COVID-19 in the capital
city of South Korea, Seoul, where no lockdown has been imposed. We curate hourly data of
subway ridership, traffic volume and population present count at selected points of interests.
The results to be derived from the presented datasets can be used as an important reference
for public health decision making in the post COVID-19 era.

Background & Summary
Investigating the relationship between epidemic outbreak and human mobility has received
significant attention from researchers around the world1-4. Using province-to-province travel
history data3-4, Kraemer et al. (2020) and Tian et al. (2020) examined the effect of human
mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China1,2. While the studies
provided an important indication of how reduced human mobility contributed to mitigating
the spread of COVID-19, no study focused on the relationship between COVID-19 and mobility
at a finer scale using comprehensive, high-resolution datasets.
Seoul, the capital city of South Korea, has been able to maintain the maximum daily case
under 52 (5.34 per 1M population) as of July 26, 2020 without a major lockdown or restriction
on movement5-8. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the way that 10 million citizens travel has
undergone considerable changes in accordance with increased public health risks across the
nation, exhibiting an unprecedented drop in people’s movement even without intensive
mobility-constraining measures9-11.
To address the complex association between pandemic’s spread and mobility pattern
changes in a highly populated city, this paper presents a comprehensive set of mobility data
concerning nearly 10 million citizens’ movements during COVID-19 in Seoul. Specifically, we
collect and curate two categories of mobility datasets: trip mode and trip purpose. The trip
mode datasets contain hourly subway ridership12 at 275 stations and hourly traffic volume13
at 105 traffic count locations across Seoul. Each dataset is a representative of individual
movements within the city, accounting for 7.47 million daily trips on average for the case of
subway ridership. The trip purpose dataset contains the number of people who are physically
present in a specific geospatial extent during each one-hour period (i.e. population present
count14). Population present count data is collected and estimated by Korea Telecom (KT)15
using the company’s geolocation data of people. The data is available at the smallest statistical
unit* (SSU) level, for which population counts are available on both resident- and presentbasis. This dataset can be used as a proxy for capturing mobility patterns at specific points of
interests (POIs). A POI is associated with categories of places, such as restaurants and shopping
malls16,17, that people visit for particular purposes. In this paper, we select several POI
categories and retrieve population present count data of SSUs in which the selected POIs are
located. The retrieved data can be used to examine how human mobility within small regions
containing POIs have changed in association with increased public health risks.
Trip mode dataset spans a 185 day-duration for both year 2020 and year 2019 while trip
purpose dataset spans a 100 day-duration. One can use last year’s data as a baseline to analyze
the reduction in mobility while accounting for seasonality. By analyzing mobility patterns
within the city that has not imposed any major lockdown or movement restrictions, one can
form an important basis for understanding the relationship between COVID-19 spread and
changes in daily mobility patterns, which can further be used as a reference for public health
decision making in the post COVID-19 era.

There are 19,153 SSUs (i.e. jipgyegu) in Seoul. The area of SSU ranges from 301 m2 to
9,691,745 m2 (mountainous region) with a median of 11,689 m2.

Methods
The mobility dataset is categorized into two types: trip mode and trip purpose. The following
subsections provide detailed descriptions of data collection and curation. The datasets are
collected from Seoul Open Data Plaza, Seoul Metro and Seoul Transport Operation &
Information Service (TOPIS), all of which offer free copyright licenses for the creation of
secondary works12,13,15. Summaries of data descriptions and data sources are shown in Table 1
and Table 2.
Trip mode data
The trip mode dataset comprises subway ridership and traffic volume data measured at hourly
intervals. Subway ridership data, provided as an open dataset by Seoul Metro12, consists of
the hourly number of passengers getting on and off at 275 stations. The modal share by the
subway system is 39.9% in Seoul18, accounting for 7.47 million daily trips on average in
201912. Traffic volume data consists of hourly traffic volumes at 100 traffic count locations,
such as major road links, including downtown, city border, bridge and city highway, and is
measured and provided by Seoul TOPIS13.
In this paper, we provide subway ridership and traffic volume data for both year 2020
and 2019, so that one can use last year’s data as a baseline to analyze the reduction in mobility
while accounting for seasonality. In each dataset, we calculate the percentage change in
hourly subway ridership and traffic volume in 2020 compared to those in 2019, by taking the
difference of data in 2020 and 2019 for each corresponding day of week. For example, the
data on Feb 7, 2020 (Friday) corresponds to the data on Feb 8, 2019 (Friday).
Trip purpose data
Trip purpose dataset includes the number of people who are physically present in a SSU in
Seoul during each one-hour period, which we call population present count14. Unlike usual
resident population counts, population present counts include daytime, workplace and visitor
populations and hence can serve as a proxy to analyze people’s movements at 1-hour
intervals.
Population present count data is collected and estimated by Korea Telecom (KT) based
on the company’s geolocation data of people15,19,20. People’s geolocation data is collected at
8,266 telecommunication base stations operated by KT across Seoul19,20. Whether a person is
present within the service coverage of a base station is obtained by identifying at which base
station the most recent mobile phone signal is captured19,20. Once the population count is
measured at each base station, it is then mapped to SSUs encompassing 604 km2 area of Seoul.
An estimation model was developed by KT to distribute population counts to SSUs, considering
additional datasets such as residential population, business working population, land use and
public transportation ridership19,20. For the detailed description of the model, one can refer to
KT’s registered patent20. The population present count is further modified to take into account
KT’s mobile phone market share (32%), LTE subscription rate (89%) and the ratio of turned-on
devices (93%)19,20.
Population present count data derived from mobile phone signals can serve as a proxy
for capturing changes in people’s travel behavior. For understanding how mobility patterns
have changed at a local level, we extract Points of Interests (POI) location data using Google
Places API based platform22. Point of interest (POI) represents the geographical location of a
particular place that people congregate for a specific purpose. In this paper, we select
Starbucks stores, Michelin-listed restaurants, department stores and workplaces as POIs and
retrieve population present count data for each POI categories.

Google Places API’s Nearby Search Request21 is a widely-used platform to find the
coordinates of places that match a search term (i.e. Starbucks in Seoul) within a certain radius
of a reference point. As Google Places API limits the number of search results to a maximum
of 60, we used a Google Places API based platform, Apify22, to obtain the location information
of POIs. Specific parameters used for data crawling are (126.978, 37.5665) for viewport point
latitude and longitude, zoom level 10 and unspecified maximum crawled places, given a search
string containing “name of POI” (i.e. Starbucks) plus “in Seoul” in English. Using this platform,
we obtained the coordinates of the POIs listed below. Once the POI coordinates are found,
we conducted a geometric operation to determine the intersection between POI coordinates
and geographic regions bounded by SSUs. We performed spatial join of POI point layer and
SSU polygon layer using QGIS23 and aggregated the population present counts of a set of SSUs
where the desired POIs are located. The description of each POI category is as follows:
•

•

•

Starbucks stores: Starbucks is the leading coffee chain in South Korea, having
approximately 35% ($12.4b/$35.2b in terms of sales revenue) of the nation’s coffee
franchise market24. There are 512 Starbucks stores in Seoul, indicating 52.4 stores per
million population. South Korea is known to be one of the world’s top five countries with
the largest number of Starbucks stores: 1,405 stores as of May 2020. Most of the stores
are located in urban centers, especially those with high density population. There are
333 SSUs containing the POIs, and the area of SSUs ranges from 0.0029 km2 to 0.98 km2
with a median of 0.046 km2.
Michelin restaurants: We select 80 restaurants that are currently or were previously
Michelin-starred or Bib Gourmand-listed in Seoul. The majority of these restaurants are
located in regions populated with other restaurants. There are 65 SSUs containing the
POIs, and the area of SSUs ranges from 0.0075 km2 to 1.15 km2 with a median of 0.093
km2.
Department stores: A total of 17 department stores in the metropolitan Seoul are
selected as POI. This POI represents geolocations populated with major retail stores
serving a high volume of people during the daytime. There are 16 SSUs containing the
POIs, and the area of SSUs ranges from 0.021 km2 to 0.85 km2 with a median of 0.077
km2.
Workplaces: Geospatial regions concentrated with workplaces are determined based on
the demographic information of travel survey data25. Among 424 transportation analysis
zones (TAZ) in Seoul, the top 5 TAZs with the highest number of working populations
were selected. These regions represent central business districts and industrial
complexes in Seoul. We extract population present counts of 175 SSUs comprising the
top 5 TAZs. The area of SSUs ranges from 0.0019 km2 to 1.96 km2 with a median of 0.019
km2.

Epidemiological data
In addition to mobility data, we collect epidemiological data from daily briefing video clips and
documents published by Seoul Metropolitan Government26. The epidemiological data consists
of the number of cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative fatality cases, active cases and
cumulative tests conducted in Seoul.

Data Records
The mobility datasets are released as comma-separated values (CSV) files, each of which
includes the intra-city mobility records from Jan 20, 2020 to Apr 28, 2020 for trip purpose
dataset (July 26, 2020 for trip mode dataset) and as well as from Jan 21, 2019 to Apr 30, 2019
(July 28, 2020 for trip mode dataset). The collection of trip mode and trip purpose mobility
data can be download from figshare27. A detailed description for each data category is included
in Table 1. Summary descriptive statistics are shown in Table 2. A general data format is as
follows:

Technical Validation
Missing value treatment and imputation
In the case of traffic volume data, there can be a high proportion of missing values due to the
temporary failure of equipment including loop detectors and radar guns. To treat these
missing values, we excluded all data collected from a single traffic count location if missing
values are more than 20% of the sample. This leaves 241 traffic count locations (inbound or
outbound) out of 270. If less than 20% of the collected data are missing, we imputed missing
values using K-nearest neighbourhood28, where we set K=5 and used 4 variables including date,
day of week, hour, and weekday or weekend to calculate the Euclidean distance between data
points. The same process is also applied to population present count, where data for three
census tracts were removed as more than 20% of the sample were missing values. No missing
values were found in the subway ridership dataset.

Usage Notes
There are several holiday periods during the horizon from Jan 20, 2020 to July 28, 2020 and
also for the corresponding days in 2019. For example, new Year holiday periods were Jan 2528 in 2019 and Feb 3-5 in 2020. As travel behavior changes during holidays, we provide the
descriptions of holidays in a separate file so that one can either replace or ignore any data in
the concerned period.

Code Availability
The R programming language scripts used for missing value treatment are publicly available
and can be freely downloaded from figshare.
