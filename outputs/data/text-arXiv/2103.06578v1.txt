Abstract
The wide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has declared a global
health emergency. As one of the most important targets for antibody and drug
developments, Spike RBD-ACE2 interface has received extensive attention. Here,
using molecular dynamics simulations, we explicitly evaluated the binding energetic
features of the RBD-ACE2 complex of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to find the
key residues. Although the overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is
nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, the difference in binding affinity is as
large as -16.35 kcal/mol. Energy decomposition analyses identified three binding
patches in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and eleven key residues (Phe486, Tyr505, Asn501,
Tyr489, Gln493, Leu455 and etc) which are believed to be the main targets for drug
development. The dominating forces are from van der Waals attractions and
dehydration of these residues. It is also worth mention that we found seven mutational
sites (Lys417, Leu455, Ala475, Gly476, Glu484, Gln498 and Val503) on
SARS-CoV-2 which unexpectedly weakened the RBD-ACE2 binding. Very
interestingly, the most repulsive residue at the RBD-ACE2 interface (E484), is found
to be mutated in the latest UK variant, B1.1.7, cause complete virus neutralization
escapes from highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Our present results
indicate that at least from the energetic point of view such E484 mutation may have
beneficial effects on ACE2 binding. The present study provides a systematical
understanding, from the energetic point of view, of the binding features of
SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2 acceptor. We hope that the present findings of three
binding patches, key attracting residues and unexpected mutational sites can provide
insights to the design of SARS-CoV-2 drugs and identification of cross-active
antibodies.

1. Introduction
To date, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) becomes a pandemic threat
that has declared a global health emergency of international major concern[1-3]. Since
the initial outbreak in China in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic quickly
spreads nationwide and to more than 80 countries around the world. Patients infected
by SARS-CoV-2 showed a range of symptoms that are similar to individuals who
were infected by SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012, including fever, dry
cough, headache, dyspnea and pneumonia.[4-6] As of 8 March, 2021, more than 116
million cases have been confirmed with the infection worldwide and over 2.5 million
cases infected patients have died[7]. Owing to the rapid and global dissemination of
COVID-19, the developments of efficient antibodies and drugs are inevitably
encountered by worldwide researchers as well as policy makers.
SARS-CoV-2 infection happens by spike glycoprotein (S-protein) receptor
binding domain (RBD) on the virus envelope recognizing and binding to the human
cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Recent studies
highlighted the important role of ACE2 in mediating the entry of SARS-CoV-2.[8-11]
Experimental evidence reveals that only Hela cells that expressing ACE2 are
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 whereas those without ACE2 expression are not.
Previous theoretical studies of the complex of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 have
identified some residues that are potentially involved in the interaction.[12] However,
a quantitative analysis of the actual residues that mediate the interaction remained
unclear. More importantly, despite the high similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV, isolated SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies are reported to be unable to
neutralize SARS-CoV-2.[13, 14] Therefore, a deep understanding of the binding
energetic characteristics between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 receptor is critical for
antibody and drug developments. Especially that, the key residues that mediate the
interactions between RBD and ACE2 are, principally, the targets for therapeutic
interventions.
This situation highlights the urgent necessity and feasibility of establishing a
3

quantitative model that reveals structure differences between the SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexing with the receptor and explore how the intrinsic
sequence and structure differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs
regulate the binding with ACE2. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of the
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binding to ACE2 have recently been reported
by several independent groups.[8, 9, 14] These structures enable us to theoretically
interpret the key residues dominating the total binding affinity (ΔG) at a higher
precision which is critical information for medical countermeasure development,
especially antibody and drug developments.

2. Model Construction and Computing Details
To quantitatively elucidate the interactions between the SARS coronavirus RBD
and ACE2, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) modelling of the binding
between the ACE2 and RBDs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The coordinates (as
depicted in Fig. 1a and 1b) for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex were adopted
from crystal structure by Zhou et. al., with PDB code 6M17.[15] While for
SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2, the PDB code is 2AJF.[16] Without losing the validity, the
full length was truncated to contain the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 and RBDs of
SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2. The complex was solvated in a cubic water box with a
dimension of 14.3×14.3×14.3 nm3. Sodium ions were added to neutralize the net
charge of proteins, resulting in totally 300,631 and 288,426 atoms for SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 models.
All MD simulations were conducted with the GROMACS package.[17] The
AMBER03 force field[18] was employed for proteins and salt ions. The TIP3P water
model[19] was utilized in all the simulated systems. The electrostatic interactions
were treated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method.[20, 21] All the bonds
involving hydrogen atoms were maintained at their constant equilibrium lengths with
the LINCS algorithm.[22] Each system was first energy-minimized with the steepest
descent algorithm, followed by 10 ns of pre-equilibration with position restraints
4

applied on the Spike RBD and PD atoms conducted in the NPT ensemble (1atm, 300
K) using velocity-rescale thermostat,[23] where random initial velocities were
assigned to protein and solvent atoms. For each system, five parallel trajectories of 1
μs were conducted for data-collection. A time step of 2.0 fs was used, and data were
collected every 1 ps.

3. Results and Discussions
3.1 Structural Stability of Spike RBD-ACE2 Binding Complex
To check the structural stability of RBD-ACE2 binding complex, we firstly
calculated the root mean squared displacement (RMSD) of heavy atoms in the two
5

models with respect to the crystal structures. As depicted in Fig. 1c, the SARS-CoV-2
RBD-ACE2 complex demonstrated a considerably high stability where the RMSD
values are usually less than 0.5 nm in five trajectories. This phenomenon reflects that
SARS-CoV-2 binding with ACE2 is considerably stable which effectively restraints
the protein chain diffusion. The RBD of SARS-CoV-2 contains several loop regions
at the receptor-binding motif (RBM), which functions in the COVID-19 infection are
not well known. In the present simulations, the structures of these loops are found to
be well conserved. In contrast, the RMSD for SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 is slightly
larger except trajectory 1. For trajectory 1, the maximum value of RMSD reached
0.85 nm at 400 ns during the simulations (we have to mention that the larger structural
fluctuations indeed do not weaken the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity which is discussed
in the following). Combining these, we hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds to
ACE2 in a stronger manner than SARS-CoV because the interactions effectively
restraint the loop mobility.
3.2 Interaction Features of Spike RBD-ACE2 Interface
From the above analyses, the complex structures are considerably stable in the ten
1 μs trajectories. To find the quantitative differences at the RBD-PD interface between
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we calculated the binding surface area (BSA) between
RBD and PD based on these sampled structures. For SARS-CoV-2 as shown in Fig.
1d, the trajectories reveal a large binding interface with a BSA of 2,028 Å2 (1,018 Å2
on the RBD and 1,010 Å2 on the PD). While for SARS-CoV, a clearly smaller BSA of
1,822 Å2 (931 Å2 on the RBD and 891 Å2 on the PD) is observed. Generally, we
expect that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 binding involves more residues from the two
counterparts thus the binding is more intimate.
Consistent with the larger BSA of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2, the two counterparts
also formed more contacts (here a contact is recognized when a heavy atom from
ACE2 is within 0.6 nm to a heavy atom of RBD). The number of contacts (Nc) were
calculated and depicted in Fig. 1e. It is found that there are averagely 1166 contacts
between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. While for SARS-CoV, the corresponding value is
6

only 955, resulting in difference ratio of 22.1%. In addition, for both the BSA and Nc,
the values disperse in a wide range for SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 complex. While for
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2, the values are more localized. This difference reveals a
fact that SARS-CoV-2 complexing with ACE2 in a more stable mode than
SARS-CoV.
Table 1. Spike RBD-ACE2 binding affinity (unit: kcal/mol) of SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 in ten trajectories. EvdW and Eele represent direct van der Waals and
electronic interactions between Spike RBD and ACE2. Gsurf represents the non-polar
solvation energy calculated from solvent-accessible surface area model and GGB is the
polar solvation energy obtained from Generalized Born model. The corresponding
values in the brackets are standard deviations.

The massive simulated trajectories enable us to evaluate the binding affinity (ΔG)
between Spike RBD and ACE2.

Consistent with experimental results,[14, 24-26] the

theoretical predicted ΔG reveals that SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds ACE2 with higher
affinity than SARS-CoV-1 (Table 1). For SARS-CoV-2, the average ΔG of
RBD-ACE2 are calculated to be -51.92±7.68 kcal/mol from five trajectories. This
value is in line with recently theoretical predictions with PBSA method.[27] While for
SARS-CoV, the values are -35.57±7.03 kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, the
complexation of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 RBD is considerably stronger than the
SARS-CoV which is well consistent with the experimental findings[14, 24-26].We
also noticed that the enhanced binding was physically caused by the vdW attractions
(EvdW) and dehydration of unpolar residues (Gsurf) which dominantly contributed to
the total ΔG. In contrast, although the electronic attractions (Eele) between Spike RBD
and ACE2 are considerably strong, the complexation process is rather energyconsumable because the energy release (Eele) cannot compensate the dehydrations of
7

polar and charged residues (GGB). This is also in line with experimental observations
by Bloom and co-workers that reducing the polar character of interfacial residues
often enhance affinity[24]. From this result, we expect that more hydrophobic or
aromatic residues are located at the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 Spike than the SARS-CoV.

3.3 Energy Decomposition Analyses of Interfacial Residues
As stated, amongst all the residues at RBD-ACE2 interface, the identification of
key residues that drive the binding process is essential for drug development because
not all of them dominate the binding. Thus, we calculated the contributions of each
residue of Spike RBD and ACE2-PD domains to total ΔG (denoted as ΔGres). Fig. 2
depicts the contributions of key residues of Spike RBD to total ΔG which are
expressed in increasing numerical order of ΔGres. Here, key residue is recognized
when |ΔGres| > 0.3kcal/mol. Negative ΔGres stands for an attractive residue, and a
positive ΔG indicates a repulsive residue.
Totally there are six residues of SARS-CoV-2 contributing more than -2 kcal/mol
to total ΔG which involve: Phe486(-5.15), Tyr505(-4.03),

Asn501(-3.37),

Tyr489(-2.66), Gln493(-2.53) and Leu455(-2.29). Here the values in the bracket
indicate the corresponding ΔGres in kcal/mol. For SARS-CoV, there are less attracting
residues. Moreover, the first two key residues, Thr487 and Pro462, contribute only
-3.51 and -3.47 kcal/mol to total ΔG, which is clearly weaker than their counterparts
(Phe486 and Tyr505) in SARS-CoV-2. In contrast to these attracting residues, there
still exist numerous residues with positive ΔGres>0.3mcal/mol, acting like “hindrance
residues” to block the RBD-ACE2 binding. For SARS-CoV-2, these include
Glu484(0.97), Glu406(0.61), Asp405(0.52), Lys417(0.49) and Gln506(0.36). For
SARS-CoV, there is one more which involve Ser432(0.73), Lys390(0.71),
Lys465(0.60), Asp392(0.54), Asp480(0.44) and Asp393(0.35). Although these
residues act preventing the attraction between RBD and ACE2, the capability is low
because the corresponding ΔGres values are all below 1 kcal/mol.
Very recently, several experimental groups independently reported the evolution
8

studies of SARS-CoV-2 in the immune population.[28-30] They found that
SARS-CoV-2 with several substitutions (K417, E484 and N501) escapes
neutralization from highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma, amongst
which E484 accounted for much of the effect.[28-31] Our present findings of the
highest ΔGres value of E484, indicate that at least from the energetic point of view, the
mutation of E484, has beneficial effects on ACE2 binding.

Figure 2. Key residues at the RBD-ACE2 complex binding interface of SARS-CoV-2
and SARS RBD. Here, decomposed binding affinity with |ΔG | > 0.3 kcal/mol is
recognized as key residues. The stars indicate three mutation sites, K417, E484 and
N501 found in SARS-CoV-2 lineage in South Africa (Nextstrain clade
20H/501Y.V2).[32]
3.4 Key Residues Distribute in Three Spatially Separated Patches
According to the spatial distributions, these residues are classified in to three
patches as shown in Fig. 3:
Patch 1. Four residues, including Ala475, Phe486, Asn487 and Tyr489, form a
dominating binding patch (Patch-1 as indicated in Fig. 3a). In the RBD, a total of nine
cysteine residues exists, eight of which form four disulfide bonds. Among these four
9

pairs, three are inside RBD core (Cys336–Cys361, Cys379–Cys432 and Cys391–
Cys525). Other than these, one remaining pair (Cys480-Cys488) connects the loops in
the distal end of the RBM. Because the TOP1 residue Phe486 just locates in the distal
end, this Cys480-Cys488 disulfide bond is believed to be important for the Phe486 to
bind with ACE2 because it restrains the conformation of the loop. Quantitatively,
summarizing the decomposed ΔGres of the patch 1 residues, they contribute 21.6% to
the total ΔG.
For SARS-CoV-2, the Phe486 has 7 counterparts on ACE2, in detail, Thr20,
Gln24, Phe28, Leu79, Met82, Tyr83, Pro84. The Phe486 site of SARS-CoV-2
corresponds to Leu472 of SARS-CoV. Due to the relatively smaller size, the
counterpart residues only involve Glu75, Thr78, Leu79, Met82 and Tyr83. Because
both Phe486 and Leu472 are hydrophobic residues, the driving force mainly comes
from van der Waals attractions and de-hydration process. In addition, the Phe486 is
capable to form π-π stacking with aromatic residues like Phe28, Tyr83 and Pro84
which is commonly believed to be strong interactions.
Patch 2. Besides Phe486, the Tyr505 (TOP2) and Asn501 (TOP3) also contribute
-4.03 and -3.37 kcal/mol to the total binding. Together with Gln498 and Thr500, they
form the second binding patch (Patch-2 in Fig. 3a). These two residues correspond to
Tyr491 (TOP3) and Thr487 (TOP1) respectively in SARS-CoV with ΔGres of -3.20
and -3.51 kcal/mol. Generally, the locations of Tyr505+Asn501 and Tyr491+Thr487
coincide at the RBM surface. Quantitatively, the patch 2 contributes 20.8% to the total
ΔG.Patch 3. At the middle of the RBM surface, the third binding patch (Patch-3 in
Fig. 3a) is recognized which is composed of Leu455(-2.29), Phe456(-1.84) and
Gln493(-2.53). While for SARS-CoV, this patch only contains Tyr442 with a ΔGres of
-2.77 kcal/mol. The patch 3 contributes 12.8% to the total ΔG.
The above three patches play a major role in the complexing of RBD-ACE2.
Other than these residues, there are more residues in SARS-CoV-2 participating in the
binding with ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV. In detail, there are 21 residues of
SARS-CoV-2 contributing more than -0.3 kcal/mol to the total ΔG, compared to only
10

16 residues in SARS-CoV.

Figure 3. Spatial distributions of the key residues at the Spike RBD and ACE2-PD
interface. The surface of the residues is colored according to their decomposed
energetic contributions (ΔGres) to the binding affinity (blue to red: attractive residues
to repulsive residues).
It is worth mention that, Bloom and co-workers have reported that mutations of
Gln493, Gln498 and Asn501 can enhance ACE2 affinity[24]. These three residues
have also been observed in the present studies where Gln494 belongs to patch-3,
Gln498 and Asn501 belong to patch-2.
As the counterparts of Spike RBD, the key residues in ACE2-PD are mostly
similar when binding to SARS-CoV-2(Fig. 3c) and SARS-CoV (Fig. 3d). For instance,
the TOP3 key residues uniformly involve Gln24, His34 and Asp355 in the two cases.
However, we noticed that most of these counterpart residues bind in a stronger
manner with SARS-CoV-2 RBD than the SARS-CoV. Especially for the TOP3
residues, the binding energy difference is as large as about –1 kcal/mol for each
residue, indicating more intimate binding between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2.

3.5 Sequence Alignment According to Decomposition Binding Energy
The whole sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shares around 80% similarities to
SARS-CoV. At the RBD domain, there are 35% mutations (41 out of 116). However,
11

the specific roles of the Spike RBD, especially for the mutation sites, are yet to be
well documented. Summarizing all the present data, we classified the Spike RBD
sequence into three types according to their specific roles in the Spike RBD-ACE2
binding (Fig. 4).

Figure 4. Sequence alignment of SRAS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBD. Circles
indicate key residues mediating the binding (|ΔGres|>0.3 kcal/mol). For residues in
SARS-CoV-2, those enhancing the binding affinity (ΔΔGres<-0.3 kcal/mol) than
SARS-CoV are indicated by up-triangle, while those weakening the binding
((ΔΔGres>0.3 kcal/mol)) are indicated by down-triangle.
Type 1. Strengthen attraction (residues with decreased negative ΔGres): this
represents residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD forming stronger attraction with ACE2 than
SARS-CoV, which involves Ile418, Phe456, Tyr473, Phe486, Asn487, Tyr489,
Phe490, Leu492, Gln493, Tyr495, Gly496, Phe497, Tyr505;
Type 2. Weaken repulsion (residues with decreased positive ΔGres): this
represents residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD weakening the repulsion to ACE2 than
SARS-CoV, which involves Arg403, Val445, Thr478, Ser494;
Type 3. Hinder binding (residues with increased ΔGres): this represents residues in
SARS-CoV-2 playing a negative role to the RBD-ACE2 binding, which involves
Lys417, Thr453, Leu455, Ala475, Gly476, Glu484, Gln498, Val503, Gln506.

The type 1 and type 2 residues are the essential residues for the increased binding
strength of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV with ACE2. While for type 3 residues, it is
unexpected that seven of them (except Tyr453 and Gln506) are mutation sites but
reversely hinder the Spike RBD-ACE2 binding. This is unexpected because whether
12

these mutational sites have functional relevance are yet to be known.
4. Conclusions
To summarize, we have systematically simulated the binding structures of
RBD-ACE2 of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. By Generalized Born model, the
key residues that dominating the complexation process have been found and discussed.
At the RBD-ACE2 interface, three binding patches in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and
eleven key residues (Phe486, Tyr505, Asn501, Tyr489, Gln493, Leu455 and etc.) have
been identified which are believed to be the main targets for drug development. Seven
mutational sites (Lys417, Leu455, Ala475, Gly476, Glu484, Gln498 and Val503) on
SARS-CoV-2 unexpectedly weakened the RBD-ACE2 binding. Interestingly the most
repulsive residue at the RBD-ACE2 interface, Glu484, is found to be mutated in the
latest UK variant, B1.1.7[31] to cause virus neutralization escapes from highly
neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Further efforts are highly required to
probe whether these sites have other functional relevance. The present findings gave a
deep understanding of the binding features between RBD and ACE2, providing
important structural insights to the design of SARS-CoV-2 drugs and identification of
cross-active antibodies.
