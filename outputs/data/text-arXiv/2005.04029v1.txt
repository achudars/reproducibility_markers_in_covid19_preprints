The overall mortality caused by COVID-19 in the European region is highly
associated with demographic composition: A spatial regression-based
approach

Abstract
The demographic factors have a substantial impact on the overall casualties caused by the
COVID-19. In this study, the spatial association between the key demographic variables and
COVID-19 cases and deaths were analyzed using the spatial regression models. Total 13 (for
COVID-19 case factor) and 8 (for COVID-19 death factor) key variables were considered for
the modelling. Total five spatial regression models such as Geographically weighted regression
(GWR), Spatial Error Model (SEM), Spatial Lag Model (SLM), Spatial Error_Lag model
(SEM_SLM), and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) were performed for the spatial modelling and
mapping of model estimates. The local R2 values, which suggesting the influences of the
selected demographic variables on overall casualties caused by COVID-19, was found highest
in Italy and the UK. The moderate local R2 was observed for France, Belgium, Netherlands,
Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania. The lowest local R2 value
for COVID-19 cases was accounted for Latvia and Lithuania. Among the 13 variables, the
highest local R2 was calculated for total population (R2 = 0.92), followed by death crude death
rate (R2 = 0.9), long time illness (R2 = 0.84), population with age >80 (R2 = 0.59), employment
(R2 = 0.46), life expectancy at 65 (R2 = 0.34), crude birth rate (R2 = 0.31), life expectancy (R2
= 0.31), Population with age 65-80 (R2 = 0.29), Population with age 15-24 (R2 = 0.27),
Population with age 25-49 (R2 = 0.27), Population with age 0-14 (R2 = 0.23), and Population
with age 50-65 (R2 = 0.23), respectively. This suggests that the total population, death crude
death rate, long time illness are the key factors that are regulating overall casualties of COVID19. This study found that the demographic composition of the country predominantly controls
1

the high rate of mortality and casualties due to COVID-19. In this study, the influence of the
other controlling factors, such as environmental conditions, socio-ecological status, climatic
extremity, etc. have not been considered. This could be scope for future research.

1. Introduction

The global pandemic caused by Coronavirus (COVID-19), a new genre of acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global health concerns for
its unpredictable nature and lack of adequate medicines (WHO, 2020; Ma et al., 2020;
Gorbalenya et al., 2020). Since no medicine is available yet to diagnose this novel disease, the
rate of mortality and casualties due to COVID-19 is unimaginably rising worldwide from its
first emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. However, according to WHO, 2020, the
rate of COVID-19 deaths depends on the immunity of a person, as most of the COVID-19
infected persons have experienced mild to moderate respiratory unwellness and cured without
requiring special treatment. As of May 02, 2020, 3 272 202 cases and 230 104 deaths of
COVID-19 reported in 215 Countries (including the applied case definitions adopted for
COVID-19 and various testing strategies adopted by different countries) (WHO, 2020).
Considering its surmount impact on overall human development, the United Nations, 2020,
declared the disease as a social, human, and economic crisis. Most of the developing countries
are experiencing the impacts and burden of this virus on the national economy. However, the
negative socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19 are not only limited to developing
countries, but the disease morbidity had also severely impacted the western developed

2

countries as well (United Nations, 2020). The Congressional Research Service (2020) analyzed
the economic impact of COVID-19 and predicted a 24% reduction of annual global gross
domestic product (GDP), a 13% to 32% decline in global trade (Mollalo et al., 2020).

The demographic factor plays a crucial role in shaping the pattern of COVID-19
positive cases and deaths across the globe. According to UNDESA (2019) and WHO (2020),
the inter(national) migrants, especially those involved in low-income jobs, are the most
affected and vulnerable to death and infection of COVID-19. As of 22 April 2020, the migrants
accounted for 10% of the total population for 10 out of the 15 countries having the highest
number of COVID-19 cases. However, in many cases, the migrants performed a crucial role in
tackling the COVID-19 emergency by working in several critical sectors (UN DESA,
2020; WHO, 2020). Ageing factor is also found crucial in controlling COVID-19 deaths and
spreading. The high number of COVID-19 deaths and infection in Italy may be linked with the
demographic structure of the country. The median age of the population in Italy is 46 years,
and nearly a quarter of its population over the age of 65 earmarked the country as number 4th
with a higher proportion of the old age population. The same pattern is evident in Spain (the
median age of the population is 43.9 years and more than 25000 COVID-19 deaths reported so
far in Spain) (Slate, 2020; Population Europe, 2020). According to WHO (2020), in Europe,
more than 95 percent of people who have died due to COVID-19 have been over 60. The longtime illness and existing respiratory disease history are also found associated with COVID-19
deaths. Zhou et al., (2020) study in Wuhan, China found that patients with existing respiratory
diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease, etc. are the most
vulnerable to COVID-19 deaths. Almagro & Orane-hutchinson, (2020) developed a regression
model to evaluate the statistical significance between the control (neighborhood characteristics,
occupations) and response variables (COVID-19 incidence) in New York City’s

3

neighborhoods. This study found that occupations were substantially explaining the observed
COVID-19 patterns as people with high-level social outreach and higher social interaction were
more vulnerable to be infected to the virus. Several other studies have also evaluated the
association between the explanatory variables such as neighborhood characteristics (Borjas,
2020); age structure (Dowd et al., 2020 Kulu & Dorey, 2020); psychological interventions
(Duan & Zhu, 2020); pre-existing health records (Fu et al., 2020); population flows and control
measures (Kraemer et al., 2020); the influence of social and economic ties (Mogi & Spijker,
2020) and COVID-19 cases and deaths across the globe.

This study further advances the assessment of the impact of demographic parameters
on the spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe by adopting spatial regressionbased approaches. Spatial regressions models have been used extensively in many virus studies
ranges from local to a global scale (Zhao et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Liu et
al., 2020). Diuk-Wasser et al., (2006) evaluated the spatial distribution of mosquito vectors for
West Nile virus in Connecticut, the USA using logistic regression models. Kauhl et al., (2015)
have evaluated the spatial distribution of Hepatitis C virus infections and associated
determinants using Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) model. Kauhl et al.,
(2015) advocated the uses of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial
epidemiological methods for providing viable screening interventions with identifying spatial
hotspots/clusters as well as demographic and socio-economic determinants that have a strong
association with the casualties caused by the virus. Linard et al., (2007) study on determinants
of the geographic distribution of Puumala virus and Lyme borreliosis infections in Belgium
found that the environmental and socio-economic factors play a crucial role in determining the
spatial variation in disease risk. Mollalo et al., (2020) performed GIS-based spatial modelling
to evaluate the impact of socioeconomic, behavioural environmental, topographic, and

4

demographic factors on COVID-19 incidence in the continental United States and found that
different explanatory variables including income inequality, median household income, the
proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners, etc. largely control the
spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in the USA. Malesios et al., (2020) study evaluated the
spatiotemporal evolution patterns of the bluetongue virus outbreak on the island of Lesvos,
Greece, and found a strong spatial autocorrelation between the spread of bluetongue virus and
farms located nearby. Since COVID-19 a novel virus and no study is available so far that
evaluate the close association between the demographic determinants and spread of COVID19, this study has made an effort to address the mentioned research gap and to provide effective
solutions for future preparedness for COVID-19 like situation.

2. Materials and methods

2.1 Data source and variable selection

Initially, a total of 28 demographic variables have been considered for the modelling
and spatially explicit mapping of model estimates. The demographic data for the European
region was collected from Eurostat1. The description of the variables chosen in this study is
given in Table. 1. Using the regression models, including stepwise, forward, and backward
regression models, a total of 13 (for COVID-19 case factor) and 8 (for COVID-19 death factor)
variables were selected for the analysis (Table. S1, S2). Variables chosen for COVID-19 death
modelling are – employment (Emplo), inactive population (Inc_Pop), infant mortality
(Inf_Mor), people having a long-standing illness or health problem by educational attainment
level (LIlln_Edu), poverty (Pov), crude birth rate (CBR), death and crude death rate (D_CDR),

and total population (Tot_Pop), respectively. For COVID-19 case factor, a total of 13 variables
were considered - total population (Tot_Pop), death and crude death rate (D_CDR), population
by age group 0 -14 age (Pop0_14), population by age group 15 -24 age (Pop15_24), population
by age group 25-49 age (Pop25_49), population by age group 50 -64 age (Pop50_64),
population by age group 65 -79 age (Pop65_79), population by age group more than 80
(Pop>80), life expectancy at age 65 (LExp_65), employment (Emplo), crude birth rate (CBR),
life expectancy (LExp), people having a long-standing illness or health problem by educational
attainment level (LIlln_Edu), respectively. Additionally, partial least square regression (PLSR)
and principal components regression (PCR) modelling was done to examine the model
accuracy and identify the most important independent variables that could explain the
maximum model variances. The COVID-19 cases and deaths data was retrieved from 31st
December 2019 to 29th April 2020 from European Union Open data portal2. Few European
countries (Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, Faroe Islands,
Guernsey, Jan Mayen, Jersey, Liechtenstein, Macedonia, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino,
Serbia, and Turkey) were removed from the analysis due to data unavailability. After filtering,
a total of 31 European countries were selected for spatial regression modelling and mapping.

2.2 Spatial regression modelling

The spatial regression models (SRM) have been used extensively for evaluating
demographic pattern analysis (Chi & Zhu, 2008), estimating land surface temperature (Jain et
al., 2019; Chakraborti et al., 2018), urban air quality monitoring (Fang et al., 2015), ecosystem
service valuation (Sannigrahi et al., 2020a; Sannigrahi et al., 2020b). Understanding the spatial
effects such as spatial autocorrelation, spatial stationarity, and heterogeneity of a feature

distribution is one of the fundamental applications of spatial regression models. In this study,
total five spatial regression models include Geographically weighted regression (GWR),
Spatial Error Model (SEM), Spatial Lag Model (SLM), Spatial Error_Lag model (SEM_SLM),
and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) models were implemented to evaluate how the demographic
factors are shaping the pattern of COVID-19 case/deaths across Europe. Among these five
regression models, the global interaction between the demographic factors and COVID-19
cases/deaths were analyzed using OLS, SEM, SLM, and SEM_SLM models as these model
are not impacted by spatial autocorrelation or homogeneity in the feature space. The local
association between the control and response variables was calculated using the GWR model.

The GWR model is a local spatial regression model that assumes that traditional
‘global’ regression models such as OLS, SEM, SLM, etc. may not be effective enough do
describe spatial variation of interactions, especially when spatial process varies with spatial
context (Chen et al., 2018; Oshan et al., 2019). Unlike OLS, SEM, SLM spatial regression
models, the GWR model depends on the assumption of spatial non-stationarity and
heterogeneity in feature space and quantifies the locally varying parameter estimates
(Fotheringham et al. 1996; Brundson et al., 2002). GWR calculates the location-specific
interaction among the control and response variables after integrating the spatially referenced
data layers (Brundson et al., 2002; Lugoi et al., 2019).

the explanatory variables (demographic variables). (Brunsdon et al., 1996) suggested that the

7

GWR can easily compute locally varying parameter estimates, and thus found to be highly
effective to produce detailed spatially explicit maps of locational variations in relationships.
The OLS is a type of global regression models that examine the (non)spatial
relationships between the set of control and response variables with the fundamental
assumption of homogeneity and spatial non-variability (Sun et al., 2020; Oshan et al., 2019;
Mollalo et al., 2020; Ward and Gleditsch, 2018):

yi =  0 + xi  +  i

(2)

Where i and yi are the COVID-19 incidence parameters, β0 is the intercept, xi is the vector of
selected demographic variables, β is the vector of regression coefficients, and εi is a random
error. The fundamental function of OLS is to optimize the regression coefficients (β) by
reducing the sum of squared prediction errors (Anselin and Arribas-Bel, 2013; Mollalo et al.,
2020; Oshan et al., 2019). The usual OLS method assumes that the residual errors are
homogenous and un-correlated and thereby the traditional OLS has proven to be inefficient
when the errors are heterogeneous and spatially correlated and lead to a bias in regression
coefficient estimation (Goodchild et al., 1993; Yang & Jin, 2010).
The SLM is based on a “spatially-lagged dependent variable” and assumes the close
association between the response and control variables. Additionally, SLM also assumes
dependency between the independent variables, which denotes that an independent variable
could be influenced by another independent variable in the neighbourhood region (Z. Wu et
al., 2020). Therefore, spatial lag function, which computes the influence of adjacent
independent variables on another independent variable, can be used as a new independent
variable in spatial regression modelling (Z. Wu et al., 2020). The SLM incorporates spatial

8

dependency between the parameters into the regression model (Anselin, 2003; Ward and
Gleditsch, 2018; Mollalo et al., 2020; Z. Wu et al., 2020).

where ρ is the spatial lag parameter, and Wi is a vector of spatial weights. The weight matrix

explanatory variables in feature space (Anselin and Arribas-Bel, 2013; Mollalo et al., 2020)
The SEM assumes spatial dependence in the OLS residuals, which is generated from
the OLS modelling error term as OLS, often ignoring the spatial dependent independent
variables in the modelling (Guo et al., 2020; Z. Wu et al., 2020; Mollalo et al., 2020). Therefore,
the residuals of OLS are decomposed into two spatial components- error term and a random
error term (for satisfying the assumption in the modelling).

yi =  xi + ui

ui =  wi u j +  i

where ui and uj are the error terms at locations i and j, respectively, and λ is the coefficient of
spatial component errors.
The GWR model was performed using the ArcGIS Pro 2.5.03. The other spatial
regression models, i.e., SEM, SLM, OLS, SEM_SLM, were performed in GeoDaSpace
software4. All the statistical analysis was performed in R studio5 (an integrated development

was done in ArcGIS Pro and R studio.

3. Results
The spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths are presented in Fig. 1. The
highest number of cases were observed in Italy, France, Spain, and the UK. While minimum
COVID-19 cases were accounted in Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Greece, Slovakia,
Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia, and Lithuania, respectively. Moderate levels of COVID-19 cases
were detected in Poland, Romania, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden (Fig. 1). Considering
the COVID-19 deaths across Europe, the maximum COVID-19 deaths were recorded in Italy,
France, Spain, and the UK, and moderate level morbidity was observed in Germany, Belgium,
Netherlands, Switzerland, and Sweden. In addition, the lower COVID-19 deaths were reported
in Finland, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary,
Bulgaria, Greece, Slovenia, and Austria, respectively (Fig. 1).
The spatially varying local R2 and intercept were computed using the GWR model for
both COVID-19 case and death factors (Fig. 2). Considering local R2 for the case factor, the
highest association between the demographic variables and the COVID-19 case was observed
in Italy and the UK. The moderate local R2 was observed for France, Belgium, Netherlands,
Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania. The lowest local R2 value
for COVID-19 cases was accounted for Latvia and Lithuania (Fig. 2). The intercept value was
found in the western European region (Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, UK, Netherlands,
Belgium, Germany, and Denmark). The association between the demographic variables and

10

COVID-19 death was also computed, and the said association was found highest in Italy,
Greece, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia (Fig. 2). Using 13 and 8 filtered demographic variables,
the GWR model explained 92% and 93% model variances for COVID-19 cases and COVID19 deaths (Table. 2). The adjusted R2 was found higher for the COVID-19 death factor, which
suggests the accuracy of the GWR model in explaining the spatial distribution of total COVID19 deaths and its association with the demographic structure of the country. Additionally, the
high local R2 value derived from the GWR model for COVID-19 cases and deaths is also
exhibiting the influence of population characteristics on the spread of the Corona pandemic.
The individual influence of the 13 final demographic variables (for COVID-19 cases)
is also evaluated and presented in Fig. 3 and Table. 3. Among the 13 variables, the highest
local R2 was calculated for Tot_Pop (R2 = 0.92), followed by D_CDR (R2 = 0.9), LIlln_Edu
(R2 = 0.84), Pop>80 (R2 = 0.59), Emplo (R2 = 0.46), LExp_65 (R2 = 0.34), CBR (R2 = 0.31),
LExp (R2 = 0.31), Pop_65-80 (R2 = 0.29), Pop_15-24 (R2 = 0.27), Pop_25-49 (R2 = 0.27),
Pop_0-14 (R2 = 0.23), and Pop_50-65 (R2 = 0.23), respectively (Table. 3). The adjusted R2 of
estimated for the selected variables followed the same pattern as observed for local R2.
Considering the spatial association between the Tot_Pop and COVID-19 cases, the highest
local R2 value was observed for Italy, the UK, Slovenia, and Croatia. The moderate association
between Tot_Pop and COVID-19 case was found in Spain, France, Ireland, Germany, Belgium,
Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Sweden (Fig. 3), whereas the lower association between
Tot_Pop and cases was accounted for Estonia and Latvia (Fig. 3). The local R2 values estimated
for Pop0_14, Pop25_49, Pop50_64, Pop65_79, Pop>80, LIlln_Edu, and D_CDR, was found
minimum over the western European region, and relatively higher R2 values for these variables
were accounted in the northern and eastern European region (Fig. 3).
The spatial association between the 8 demographic variables (considered for COVID19 death) and COVID-19 deaths were analysed and presented in Fig. 4 and Table. 4. Total 5
11

out of the 8 independent variables including Tot_Pop (R2 = 0.93), D_CDR (R2 = 0.93), Pov
(R2 = 0.63), LIlln_Edu (R2 = 0.63), and Emplo (R2 = 0.48) exhibited strong association with
COVID-19 deaths across the Europe. The other 3 variables, i.e. Inc_Pop (R2 = 0.27), CBR (R2
= 0.26), and Inf_Mor (R2 = 0.24) haven’t produced any significant association with COVID19 death factor. The spatially varying Local R2 values of the demographic variables were found
maximum in the southern and southeastern European region (Italy, Greece, Bulgaria). While a
lower spatial R2 value was recorded in the western region, except the Emplo variable (Fig. 4).
Fig. 5 shows the linear association between 13 (for cases)

and 8 (for death)

demographic variables and COVID-19 spread and deaths casualties in the European countries.
For the COVID-19 case factor, the coefficient of determination (R2) value was recorded as
0.79, while for the death factors, the linear model has explained 64% model variances (Fig. 5,
Table. 5). The PLS and PCR models were also executed for examining the model variances,
and it has been found that the variables chosen for the COVID case factor were performed have
explained the maximum model variances (Table. 6). For case factors, the PLS and PCR models
have explained 86% and 95% model variances, and for death factors, the PLS and PCR models
have explained 62% and 96% model variances (Table. 6).
Using the combination of demographic variables and the GWR model, the prediction
of COVID-19 cases and deaths was performed and presented in Fig. 6. For the case factor,
93% model accuracy was observed between the actual and predicted COVID-19 cases. For the
death factor, the accuracy was 97% between the predicted and actual COVID-19 death. The
GWR based prediction for both case and death factors suggesting the effectivity of spatial
regression models in explaining predicting the casualties caused by any epidemic/pandemic in
the future time. Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 explained the linear association between the demographic
variables and COVID-19 cases and death. For the case factor, a total 5 out of 13 variables have
been strongly associated with the spread and COVID-19 cases. While for the death scenario,
12

Tot_Pop and D_CDR were found to be highly associated with the COVID-19 death factor. The
correlation among and between the demographic variables and COVID-19 cases and deaths
are presented in Fig. 9. Among the causative factors, high correlation were observed for
Tot_Pop, D_CDR, Pop>80, and LExp, respectively. Fig. 10 shows the similar pattern of
association as Tot_Pop, D_CDR, LIlln_Edu, LExp are found to be key determinants and
explained the maximum model variances.
The overall summary of the five spatial regression models are reported in Table. 7.
Among the 13 demographic variables chosen for case factor, the average R2 was observed for
Tot_Pop (R2 = 0.82), followed by D_CDR (R2 = 0.77), Pop>80 (R2 = 0.3), LIlln_Edu (R2 =
0.21), L_Exp (R2 = 0.16), LExp_65 (R2 = 0.15), CBR (R2 = 0.10), Pop25_49 (R2 = 0.10),
Pop15_24 (R2 = 0.08), Pop50_64 (R2 = 0.08), Pop65_79 (R2 = 0.08), and Pop0_14 (R2 = 0.06),
respectively. For death factor, the highest R2 value was calculated for Tot_Pop (R2 = 0.71),
followed by D_CDR (R2 = 0.63), LIlln_Edu (R2 = 0.17), Pov (R2 = 0.16), Emplo (R2 = 0.15),
Inc_Pop (R2 = 0.10), CBR (R2 = 0.08), and Inf_Mor (R2 = 0.06), respectively. Considering the
results of all five spatial regression models, the demographic variables explained 82% model
variances for COVID-19 case factor and 71% model variances for COVID-19 death factor
(Table. 7).

4. Discussion
The spatial distribution of COVID-19 deaths and positive cases were mapped, and its
association with key demographic variables were evaluated to understand how the
demographic structure of a country can modulate the pandemic scenario caused by the novel
coronavirus. The distribution of the positive COVID-19 cases and deaths were found
heterogeneous across Europe. This uneven distribution could be attributed to many
13

corresponding factors, including demography, climatic, cultural, or socio-economic differences
among the countries considered in this study. For both positive COVID-19 cases and deaths,
the maximum records were observed in the western European region (Spain, Italy, France,
Germany, UK, Belgium, Netherlands). While, the cases and deaths were found minimum in
the Eastern (Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) and Northern European
region (Norway, Finland, Sweden). Similar observation was documented in Likassa et a.
(2020) study where the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases was highly associated with
case-fatality rate, and the linkages between these two variables were much stronger and reached
up to 8.0% for patients with the age group of 70 to 79 years and 14.8% for patients aged >80
years. Moreover, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths is found unpredictable
for both regions and countries. Likassa et a. (2020) also stated that the high infection death rate
in China, Italy, Iran, and the USA, should be linked with the spread of previous virus outbreak.
According to Kraemer et al. (2020), the human mobility factor is substantially explaining the
spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China as the growth rates become stable or negative
in some areas where strong control measures were implemented and mandatorily imposed.
However, the mobility factors in the other regions where the stringent regulations were not
implemented, still pose severe threats by transmitting the infection in the closest neighbours
(Kraemer et al., 2020).
The spatial association between the demographic variables and COVID-19 cases and
deaths were found maximum in the southern, western European regions. All the 13
demographic variables considered for spatial regression modelling produced higher local R2
estimates for Italy, Spain, France, Germany, UK, Greece, Bulgaria, Belgium, Netherland,
Ireland. All these countries have been affected badly in terms of the total number of cases and
deaths caused by COVID-19. Conversely, the weak association between demographic
variables and the COVID-19 case factor was found in the eastern European countries (Estonia,
14

Latvia, Finland). Several factors are responsible for this uneven distribution of spatial
association. This includes the age structure of the population, ratio of the elderly population,
ratio of dependent population, the socio-economic structure of the society, etc. Considering the
spatial association between the demographic variables and the COVID-19 death factor, the
maximum values were accounted for the southern European countries, i.e., Italy, Croatia,
Greece, Slovenia, France, Spain, UK, Ireland, Norway. While slightly lower estimates were
observed in the eastern European regions. The intercept values calculated for the two response
variables (cases and deaths) were followed the same pattern as observed for the COVID-19
death factor. The individual influences of all the13 and 8 demographic variables on COVID19 cases and deaths exhibited distinctive spatial association and explained substantial model
variances. Among the 13 variables chosen for COVID-19 case factors, Tot_Pop, Pop>80,
LIlln_Edu, and D_CDR were correlated strongly with the case factor. For the death factor,
Tot_Pop, D_CDR, Pov, LIlln_Edu explained the maximum model variances.
Demographic pattern and structure of a country can substantially modulate the overall
impact of a widespread pandemic and therefore may be epidemiologically informative (Jia et
al., 2020); Dowd et al., 2020; Mollalo et al., 2020; Borjas, 2020; Almagro & Orane-hutchinson,
2020). In many cases, the socio-economic determinants play a crucial role in amplifying
casualties due to COVID-19. Therefore, it has been suggested that paying more attention to
controlling (inter)national migration, restricted population flows, modernizing the healthcare
system by improving diagnosis and treatment capacity, and upgrading the public welfare
system to make it fully functional for the crisis situation, could be the point of interest in order
to fight against the COVID-19 like situation effectively (Su et al., 2020). The availability of
sufficient SARS-CoV-2 testing centers is also found to be important for adopting control
strategies and decision making for minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on the overall socioecological system (Rader et al., 2020). Rader et al. ( 2020) also reported the that in the USA, a
15

total of 6,236 unique SARS-CoV-2 testing sites is available for the 3,108 counties and nearly
30%, 86%, and 5% of the total population, mountain population, and middle Atlantic
population is lived in counties with median travel times over 20 min. The demographic
parameters like population density, % of minority to total population, % of population with noinsurance and median income range of the population were found to be the main determinants
of median travel time to testing sites. Moreover, the accessibility to SARS-Cov-2 testing sites
in USA is increased with high population density and lower % of minority and uninsured
people (Rader et al., 2020).

Using all the (non)spatial regression models including GWR, OLS, SLM, SER,
SLM_SEM, PCR, PLS, MLR, the individual and collective effect of the demographic variables
on COVID-19 cases and deaths were analyzed and reported. Among the 13 variables
considered for COVID-19 case factor, Tot_Pop, D_CDR, Pop>80, LIlln_Edu, LExp, LExp_65,
and Emplo factors were strongly associated with the COVID-19 cases across the European
region. A similar association was observed between the demographic factors and COVID-19
in Wuhan, China (Wu et al., 2020). Wu et al., (2020) examined the association between preexisting illness of the patients, including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and
Pneumonia and its association with COVID-19 and found that patients with exiting respiratory
illness were more susceptible to COVID-19. The psychological status of the people, especially
the old age people, is closely linked with the diagnostic of COVID 19 (Wang et al., 2020).
Therefore, the combination of effective psychological interventions, including the lower level
of psychological pressure and behavioural practices that boost mental health, can be used to
improve the psychological status of vulnerable communities (Wang et al., 2020). Aging adults
(>65) with long-term illness and incapable of household works were found highly vulnerable
COVID-19 (Lakhani, 2020). Above the age 80, the proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 in

16

Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and France was 50%, 58%, 59%, and 59%, respectively (Medfod &
Trias-Llimos, 2020). These statistics signifying the inherent connections amongst the
demographic composition and overall COVID-19 deaths and cases reported so far in the
European region. Apart from the demographic factors, several climatic factors, including
average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, rainfall, average
humidity, wind speed, and air quality is also regulates the spread and casualties of COVID-19
(Bashir et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020).

5. Conclusion
In this study, the spatial association between the demographic variables and COVID19 cases and deaths was evaluated across the Europe. Several spatial regression models
including GWR, OLS, SLM, SEM, etc. was performed for conducting the spatial regression
modelling. Both COVID-19 cases and deaths were considered as dependent variables for the
experiment. All the explanatory variables included in the spatial regression modelling produced
high locally varying associations for Italy, Spain, France, UK. This can be attributed to the
demographic composition of these countries as Italy has the second oldest population in the
world and the oldest in Europe. The population composition of the other European countries
i.e. Spain, France, and the Netherlands, that affected badly by COVID-19, is also dominated
by senior and old age populations, thereby increasing the vulnerability to COVID-19 and many
similar COVID-19 pandemics in the future (Medfod & Trias-Llimos, 2020). Lippi et al.,
(2020) stated that three main determinants – male sex, population with age >60, and preexisting comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, and
cardiovascular disorders, strongly determine the rate of COVID-19 death and infection.
Therefore, Lippi et al., (2020) suggested for adopting the following protection measures
including “(i) minimization of direct contact with health professionals, friends, and relatives,

17

by using digital devices, (ii) use of new technologies to intervene remotely in order to reduce
the negative effects of social isolation, as well as (iii) providing timely population-specific
health information to support patients and healthcare providers” to tackle the casualties of
COVID-19 effectively. This study found that the high rate of mortality and casualties due to
COVID-19 is predominantly controlled by the demographic composition of the country. In this
study, the influence of the other controlling factors such as environmental condition, socioecological status, climatic extremity, etc. have not been considered. This could be a scope for
future research.
