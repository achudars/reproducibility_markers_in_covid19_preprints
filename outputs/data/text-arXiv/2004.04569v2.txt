Abstract

the moment, there is a lack of sufficiently large and publicly available records of image data. Data is, however,
essential for machine learning techniques. With the intention to simplify the access to currently publicly available
image data and metadata we started this survey.

This regularly updated survey provides an overview
of public resources that offer medical images and
metadata of COVID-19 cases. The purpose of this
survey is to simplify the access to open COVID-19

Introduction

Recent study results have show that medical imaging can
be used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [19]. Moreover,
two recent studies indicate that COVID-19 is possibly
better diagnosed with radiological imaging when compared to the PCR-Test [12, 18]. To classify computer
tomography (CT) images of COVID-19 cases automatically, a Convolutional Neural Network has been used
in [20]. The study aimed to answer the questions, if artificial intelligence technology can be used to early screen
COVID-19 patients from their CT images and what is
the corresponding diagnostic accuracy. The study also focused on the development of an early screening model to
distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral
pneumonia and healthy cases. The experiments showed
that the overall accuracy was 86.7% from the perspective
of CT cases as a whole.
Recently, a call has been launched for scientists working
in the field of artificial intelligence to focus their research
and knowledge on the current coronavirus crisis [1]. At

many countries. Also, the flow of information and exchange between physicians and scientists is limited due
to the lockdowns in various countries. More massive
data sets with image data of COVID-19 cases are, therefore, either not available or not publicly accessible. However, since these data sets are urgently needed to support
the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 with machine
learning or artificial intelligence technologies, we would
like to contribute with this initiative to the full exploration and further development of the currently available
potential of different technologies.

About the Initiative

Since the authors are currently working on the detection
of COVID-19 with machine learning themselves, this survey will be updated regularly. We would be very grateful
if members of the community could share sources with us,
which are not yet listed here. Please report all errors to
our email addresses. We will fix them as soon as possible. With this initiative, we also would like to encourage
all scientists to make their data sets publicly available to
the community, provided that data protection allows it.
This initiative can also be supported by making it better
known with a citation.

List of Resources

Table 1 shows a list of resources and datasets which provide publicly accessible medical imaging data of COVID19 cases. The types of data are classified by CT, X-Ray,
magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), metadata of the
corresponding patient/case, and case review. The respective classes are annotated with Y for yes, N for no and
U for unknown.

Note of the Authors

We would like to point out not to claim any form of diagnostic performance of models until clinical studies have
been performed.
