Abstract—COVID-19 is a global epidemic. Till now, there is no
remedy for this epidemic. However, isolation and social distancing
are seemed to be effective preventive measures to control this
pandemic. Therefore, in this paper, an optimization problem is
formulated that accommodates both isolation and social distancing features of the individuals. To promote social distancing,
we solve the formulated problem by applying a noncooperative
game that can provide an incentive for maintaining social
distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the
sustainability of the lockdown policy is interpreted with the help
of our proposed game-theoretic incentive model for maintaining
social distancing where there exists a Nash equilibrium. Finally,
we perform an extensive numerical analysis that shows the
effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of achieving the
desired social-distancing to prevent the outbreak of the COVID19 in a noncooperative environment. Numerical results show
that the individual incentive increases more than 85% with an
increasing percentage of home isolation from 25% to 100% for
all considered scenarios. The numerical results also demonstrate
that in a particular percentage of home isolation, the individual
incentive decreases with an increasing number of individuals.
Index Terms—COVID-19, health economics, isolation, social
distancing, noncooperative game, nash equilibrium.

I. I NTRODUCTION
HE novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV or COVID-19) is
considered to be one of the most dangerous pandemics of
this century. COVID-19 has already affected every aspect of
individual’s life i.e. politics, sovereignty, economy, education,
religion, entertainment, sports, tourism, transportation, and
manufacturing. It was first identified in Wuhan City, China on
December 29, 2019, and within a short span of time, it spread
out worldwide [1], [2]. The World Health Organization (WHO)
has announced the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and identified
it as an epidemic on January 30, 2020 [3]. Till July 23,
2020, COVID-19 has affected 215 countries and territories
throughout the globe and 2 international conveyances [4].
The recent statistics on COVID-19 also indicate that more
than 15, 371, 829 persons have been affected in different ways
[4], [5]. Currently, the ten most infected countries are USA,
Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Peru, Mexico, Chile,
Spain, UK, and these countries contributed more than 68%
of worldwide cases. Since the outbreak, the total number of
human death and recovery to/from COVID-19 are 630, 138
and 9, 348, 761, respectively [4], [5] (till July 23, 2020). The
fatality of human life due to COVID-19 is frightening in
numerous countries. For instance, among the highest mortality
rates countries, 70% of the mortality belongs to the top 8
countries due to COVID-19. Furthermore, the percentages
of affected cases for male and female are around 55.21%
and 44.79%, whereas these values are about 76% and 24%,
respectively in death cases globally [6]. Different countries
are undertaking different initiatives to reduce the impact of
the COVID-19 epidemic, but there is no clear-cut solution to
date.
One of the most crucial tasks that countries need to do
for understanding and controlling the spread of COVID-19 is
testing. Testing allows infected bodies to acknowledge that
they are already affected. This can be helpful for taking care
of them, and also to decrease the possibility of contaminating
others. In addition, testing is also essential for a proper
response to the pandemic. It allows carrying evidence-based
steps to slow down the spread of COVID-19. However, to date,
the testing capability for COVID-19 is quite inadequate in
most countries around the world. South Korea was the second
COVID-19 infectious country after China during February
2020. However, mass testing may be one of the reasons why it

T

ACCEPTED ARTICLE BY IEEE ACCESS. DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040821

succeeded to diminish the number of new infections in the first
wave of the outbreak since it facilitates a rapid identification
of potential outbreaks [7]. For detecting COVID-19, two kinds
of tests are clinically carried out: (i) detection of virus particles
in swabs collected from the mouth or nose, and (ii) estimating
the antibody response to the virus in blood serum.
This COVID-19 epidemic is still uncontrolled in most
countries. As a result, day by day, the infected cases and
death graph are rising exponentially. However, researchers
are also focusing on the learning-based mechanism for detecting COVID-19 infections [8]–[14]. This approach can
be cost-effective and also possibly will take less time
to perform the test. Some other studies [15]–[23] focus
on finding the spreading behavior of COVID-19 by using known epidemic models like Susceptible - Infectious
- Recovered (SIR), Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered Susceptible (SIRS), Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious Recovered (SEIR), Susceptible-Infected-Hibernator-Removed
(SIHR), Susceptibl- Infected-Diagnosed-Ailing-RecognizedThreatened-Healed-Extinct (SIDARTHE) etc. However, all of
these epidemic models are confined by the hypothesis of
constant recovery rates, and they also struggle to reveal the
system dynamics when there is a limited coupling between
subpopulations [24]. Moreover, These models are inadequate
to capture typically stochastic aspects, like fade-out, extinction, and lack of synchrony due to arbitrary delays [25].
Besides, the limitations of these models, they may present
the epidemic scenario but have little impact on reducing or
controlling the causes. However, the infected cases of the
COVID-19 can be reduced by maintaining a certain social
distance among the individuals. In particular, to maintain such
social distancing, self-isolation, and community lockdown can
be possible approaches. Thus, it is imperative to develop a
model so that the social community can take a certain decision
for self-isolation/lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID19.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that focuses
on the mathematical model for monitoring and controlling
individual in a community setting to prevent this COVID19 epidemic. Thus, the main contribution of this paper is
to develop an effective mathematical model with the help of
global positioning system (GPS) information to fight against
COVID-19 epidemic by monitoring and controlling individual.
To this end, we make the following key contributions:
• First, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the social utility of individual considering both
isolation and social distancing. Here, the optimization
parameters are the positions of individual.
• Second, we reformulate the objective function which
is incorporated with the social distancing feature of an
individual as a noncooperative game. Here, we show
that home isolation is the dominant strategy for all the
individuals (players) of the game. We also prove that the
game has a Nash Equilibrium (NE).
• Third, we interpret the sustainability of lockdown policy
with the help of our model.
• Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach with the help of extensive numerical analysis.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present the literature review. We explain the system
model and present the problem formulation in Section III. The
proposed solution approach of the above-mentioned problem
is addressed in Section IV. We interpret the sustainability of
lockdown policy with our model in Section V. In Section
VI, we provide numerical analysis for the proposed approach.
We present the limitation of the current study in Section VII.
Finally, we draw some conclusions in Section VIII.
II. L ITERATURE R EVIEW
COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus identified to contaminate humans. Individuals were first affected by the 2019-nCoV
virus from bats and other animals that were sold at the seafood
market in Wuhan [26], [27]. Afterward, it began to spread from
human to human mainly through respiratory droplets produced
while individual sneeze cough or exhaling [3].
In [15], the authors present a generalized fractional-order
SEIR model (SEIQRP) for predicting the potential outbreak
of contagious diseases alike COVID-19. They also present a
modified SEIQRP model in their work, namely the SEIQRPD
model. With the real data of COVID-19, they have shown that
the proposed model has a more reliable prediction capability
for the succeeding two weeks. In [16], the authors introduce
a Bayesian Heterogeneity Learning approach for SusceptibleInfected-Removal-Susceptible (SIRS) model. They formulate
the SIRS model into a hierarchical structure and assign the
Mixture of Finite mixtures priors for heterogeneity learning.
They utilize the methodology to investigate the state level
COVID-19 data in the U.S.A. The authors induce an innovative neurodynamical model of epidemics called NeuroSIR in [17]. The proposed approach allows the modeling
of pandemic processes in profoundly different populations
and contagiousness contexts. In [18], the authors propose
a mobility-based SIR model for epidemics considering the
pandemic situations like COVID-19. The proposed model considers the population distribution and connectivity of different
geographic locations across the globe. The authors propose
a noble mathematical model for presenting the COVID-19
pandemic by fractional-order SIDARTHE model in [19]. They
prove the existence of a steady solution of the fractionalorder COVID-19 SIDARTHE model. They also produce the
necessary conditions for the fractional order of four proposed
control strategies. In [20], the authors propose a conceptual
mathematical model for the epidemic dynamics using four
compartments, namely Susceptible, Infected, Hospitalized, and
Recovered. They investigate the stability of the equilibrium for
the model using the basic reproduction number for knowing
the austerity. In [21], the authors develop a pandemic model
to inquire about the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19.
Here, they assess the theoretical impact of probable control
invasions like home quarantine, social distancing, cautious
behavior, and other self-imposed measures. They apply the
Bayesian approach and authorized data to figure out some
of the model parameters. In [22], the authors introduce a
SIHR model to prognosticate the course of the epidemic for
finding an effective control scheme. The model parameters

ACCEPTED ARTICLE BY IEEE ACCESS. DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040821

are estimated based on fitting to the published data of Hubei
province, China. In [23], the authors present a mathematical
model for COVID-19 based on three different compartments,
namely susceptible, infected, and recovered classes. They also
present some qualitative viewpoints for the model, i.e., the
existence of equilibrium and its stability issues.
Machine learning can play an important role to detect
COVID-19 infected individual based on the observatory data.
The work in [8] proposes an algorithm to investigate the
readings from the smartphone’s sensors to find the COVID
19 symptoms of a patient. Some commons symptoms of
COVID-19 victims like fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, dry
cough, lung CT imaging features, and shortness of breath
can be captured by using the smartphone. This detection
approach for COVID-19 is faster than the clinical diagnosis
methods. The authors in [9] propose an artificial intelligence (AI) framework for obtaining the travel history of
individual using a phone-based survey to classify them as
no-risk, minimal-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk of being
affected with COVID-19. The model needs to be trained with
the COVID-19 infected information of the areas where s/he
visited to accurately predict the risk level of COVID-19.
In [10], the authors develop a deep learning-based method
(COVNet) to identify COVID -19 from the volumetric chest
CT image. For measuring the accuracy of their system, they
utilize community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other nonpneumonia CT images. The authors in [11] also use deep
learning techniques for distinguishing COVID-19 pneumonia
from Influenza-A viral pneumonia and healthy cases based
on the pulmonary CT images. They use a location-attention
classification model to categorize the images into the above
three groups. Depth cameras and deep learning are applied to
recognize unusual respiratory pattern of personnel remotely
and accurately in [12]. They propose a novel and effective
respiratory simulation model based on the characteristics of
original respiratory signals. This model intends to fill the
gap between large training datasets and infrequent real-world
data. Multiple retrospective experiments were demonstrated
to examine the performance of the system in the detection
of speculated COVID-19 thoracic CT characteristics in [13].
A 3D volume review, namely “Corona score” is employed
to assess the evolution of the disease in each victim over
time. In [14], the authors use a pre-trained UNet to fragment
the lung region for automatic detection of COVID-19 from
a chest CT image. Afterward, they use a 3D deep neural
network to estimate the probability of COVID-19 infections
over the segmented 3D lung region. Their algorithm uses 499
CT volumes as a training dataset and 131 CT volumes as
a test dataset and achieves 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR
AUC. The study in [28] presents evidence of the diversity
of human coronavirus, the rapid evolution of COVID-19, and
their clinical and Epidemiological characteristics. The authors
also develop a deep learning model for identifying COVID19. and trained the model using a small CT image datasets.
They find an accuracy of around 90% using a small CT image
dataset.
In [29], the authors propose a stochastic transmission model
for capturing the phenomenon of the COVID-19 outbreak

3

by applying a new model to quantify the effectiveness of
association tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like
pathogen. In their model, they analyze synopses with a varying
number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number, the
delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that
contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom start, and the proportion of subclinical
infections. They find that contact tracing and case isolation
are capable enough to restrain a new outbreak of COVID-19
within 3 months. In [30], the authors present a risk-sensitive
social distance recommendation system to ensure private
safety from COVID-19. They formulate a social distance recommendation problem by characterizing Conditional Value-atRisk (CVaR) for a personal area network (PAN) via Bluetooth
beacon. They solve the formulated problem by proposing a two
phases algorithm based on a linear normal model. In [31], the
authors mainly dissect the various technological interventions
made in the direction of COVID-19 impact management.
Primarily, they focus on the use of emerging technologies such
as Internet of Things (IoT), drones, artificial intelligence (AI),
blockchain, and 5G in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic.
Moreover, noncooperative game theory is used by different
authors for solving resource allocation problems in communication [41], [42]. In [41], the authors represent the resource
allocation problem as a noncooperative game, where every
player desires to maximize its energy efficiency (EE). In
[42], the authors modeled the distributed resource allocation
problem as a noncooperative game in which every player
optimizes its EE individually with the support of distributed
remote radio heads.
The works [8]–[20], [28]–[31] focused on COVID-19 detection and analyzed the characteristic of its respiratory pattern.
Hence, the literature has achieved a significant result in terms
of post responses. In fact, it is also imperative to control
the epidemic of COVID-19 by maintaining social distance.
Therefore, different from the existing literature, we focus on
the design of a model that can measure individual’s isolation
and social distance to prevent the epidemic of COVID-19. The
model considers both isolation and social distancing features
of individuals to control the outbreak of COVID-19.

III. S YSTEM M ODEL AND P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
Consider an area in which a set N of 𝑁 individuals are
living under COVID-19 threat and must decide whether to
stay at home or go leave their homes to visit a market,
shop, train station, or other locations, as shown in Figure 1.
Everyone has a mobile phone with GPS. From analyzing the
GPS information, we can know their home locations of each
individuals, and longitude and latitude of these locations are
denoted by 𝑿 ℎ , and 𝒀 ℎ , respectively. We consider one time
period (e.g., 15 or 30 minutes) for our scenario and this time
period is divided into 𝑇 smaller time steps in a set T . For
each of time step 𝑡 ∈ T , we have the GPS coordinates 𝑿 and
𝒀 of every individual.

Figure 1: Exemplary System model. Isolation indicates staying
at home whereas social distancing measures the distance of a
individual from others.
Now, the deviation from home for any individual 𝑖 ∈ N in
between two time steps can be measured by using Euclidean
distance as follows:
√︃




if 𝑡 = 1,
(𝑋𝑖ℎ − 𝑋𝑖𝑡 ) 2 + (𝑌𝑖ℎ − 𝑌𝑖𝑡 ) 2 ,
𝛿𝑖𝑡 = √︃
(1)

 (𝑋𝑖𝑡−1 − 𝑋𝑖𝑡 ) 2 + (𝑌𝑖𝑡−1 − 𝑌𝑖𝑡 ) 2 , otherwise.

Thus, the total deviation from home by each individual 𝑖 ∈ N
in a particular time period can be calculated as follows:
∑︁
𝛿𝑖𝑡 , ∀𝑖 ∈ N
(2)
𝛿𝑖 =
𝑡 ∈T

On the other hand, at the end of a particular time period, the
distance between an individual 𝑖 ∈ N and any other individuals
𝑗 ∈ N , 𝑗 ≠ 𝑖 is as follows:
√︃
𝑗
𝑑𝑖 = (𝑋𝑖𝑇 − 𝑋 𝑇𝑗 ) 2 + (𝑌𝑖𝑇 − 𝑌 𝑇𝑗 ) 2 .
(3)
Hence, the total distance of individual 𝑖 ∈ N from other
individuals N𝑖 ⊆ N , who are in close proximity with 𝑖 ∈ N ,
and N𝑖 is fixed for a particular time step, can be expressed as
follows:
∑︁
𝑗
𝑑𝑖 =
𝑑𝑖 , ∀𝑖 ∈ N .
(4)
𝑗 ∈N𝑖

Our objective is to keep 𝛿 minimum for reducing the
spread of COVID-19 from infected individuals, which is an
isolation strategy. Meanwhile, we want to maximize social
distancing which mathematically translates into maximizing 𝑑
for reducing the chance of infection from others. However,
we can use log term to bring fairness [32], [33] in the
objective function among all individuals. Hence, we can pose
the following optimization problem:
max min log(𝑍 − 𝛿𝑖 ) 𝜔 𝑑𝑖(1−𝜔)

𝛿𝑖 ≤ 𝛿max ,

𝜔 ∈ [0, 1].

(5c)

In (5), 𝑍 is a large number for changing the minimization
problem to maximization one, and 𝑍 > 𝛿𝑖 , ∀𝑖 ∈ N . The optimization variables 𝑿 and 𝒀 indicate longitude, and latitude,
respectively, of the individuals. Moreover, the first term in (5)
encourages individual for isolation whereas the second term in
(5) encourages individual to maintain fair social distancing. In
this way, solving (5) can play a vital role in our understanding
on how to control the spread of COVID-19 among vast
population in the society. Constraint (5a) guarantees small
deviation to maintain emergency needs, while Constraint (5b)
assures a minimum fair distance among all the individuals to
reduce the spreading of COVID-19 from one individual to
another. Usually, local government or authority can set the
value of 𝛿max , and 𝑑 𝑚𝑖𝑛 can be set up by expertise body
like the World Health Organization (WHO). Constraint (5c)
shows that 𝜔 can take any value between 0 and 1 which
captures the importance between two key factors captured in
the objective function of (5). For example, if COVID-19 is
already spreading in a given society, then most of the weight
would go to isolation term rather than social distancing. Here,
we present a utility-based model depending on the preventing
mechanism like home isolation and social distancing. This
is an indirect approach to combat an epidemic like COVID19. We have no scope to combine traditional probabilities as
described in epidemic models (i.e., SIR, SIRS, SEIR, SIHR,
SIDARTHE, etc.) like infection and recovery in our utilitybased model. The objective of (5) is difficult to achieve as
it requires the involvement and coordination among all the 𝑁
individual. Moreover, if the individuals are not convinced then
it is also difficult for the government to attain the objective
forcefully. Thus, we need an alternative solution approach that
encourage individual separately to achieve the objective and
game theory, which is successfully used in [34], [35], can be
one potential solution, which will be elaborated in the next
section.
IV. A N ONCOOPERATIVE G AME S OLUTION
To attain the objective for a vast population, governments
can introduce incentives for isolation and also for social
distancing. Then every individual wants to maximize their
utilities or payoffs. In this way, government can play its role
for achieving social objective. Hence, the modified objective
function is given as follows:
∑︁
∑︁
𝑈 (𝜹, 𝒅) = 𝛼
log(𝑍 − 𝛿𝑖 ) + 𝛽
log 𝑑𝑖 ,
(6)
𝑖 ∈N
0

𝑖 ∈N
0

0

0

where 𝛼 = 𝛼 𝜔 and 𝛽 = 𝛽 (1 − 𝜔) with 𝛼 > 0 and 𝛽 > 0
are incentives per unit of isolation and social distancing.
In practice, 𝛼 and 𝛽 can be monetary values for per unit
of isolation and social distancing, respectively. In (6), one
individual’s position affects the social distancing of others, and
hence, the individuals have partially conflicting interest on the
outcome of 𝑈. Therefore, the situation can be interpreted with
the noncooperative game [36], [37].
A noncooperative game is a game that exhibit a competitive situation where each player (i.e., individual) needs to
make choices independent of the other individuals, given the
possible policies of the other individuals and their impact on

game in strategic form or a strategic game G is a triplet

N is a finite set of individuals, i.e., N = {1, 2, · · · , 𝑁 },
S𝑖 is the set of available strategies for individual 𝑖 ∈ N ,
𝑢 𝑖 : S → R is the payoff function of individual 𝑖 ∈ N ,
with S = S1 × S2 × .. × S𝑁 .

Theoretically, there may be many different strategies, but in
our case, we have considered two strategies, namely staying
at home and moving outside (visit market, shop, train station,
school/college etc.) for every individual. We use S𝑖 = {𝑠𝑖ℎ , 𝑠𝑖𝑚 }
to represent the set of strategies for each individual 𝑖 where
𝑠𝑖ℎ and 𝑠𝑖𝑚 indicate the strategies of staying at home and
moving outside for individual 𝑖 ∈ N , respectively. The payoff
or incentive function of any individual 𝑖 ∈ N in a time period
can be defined as follows:
(
𝛼 log 𝑍 + 𝛽 log 𝑑˜𝑖 ,
if strategy is 𝑠𝑖ℎ ,
𝑢 𝑖 (.) =
(7)
𝛼 log(𝑍 − 𝛿𝑖 ) + 𝛽 log 𝑑𝑖 , if strategy is 𝑠𝑖𝑚 .

As 𝛼 > 𝛽, so the following conditions hold from (9):
𝑢 1 (𝑠1ℎ , 𝑠2ℎ ) − 𝑢 1 (𝑠1𝑚 , 𝑠2ℎ ) ≥ 0,
𝑢 1 (𝑠1ℎ , 𝑠2𝑚 ) − 𝑢 1 (𝑠1𝑚 , 𝑠2𝑚 ) ≥ 0,

However, to find the Nash equilibrium, the following two
definitions can be helpful.
Definition 2. [40]: A strategy 𝑠𝑖 ∈ S𝑖 is the dominant strategy
0
0
for individual 𝑖 ∈ N if 𝑢 𝑖 (𝑠𝑖 , 𝑠−𝑖 ) ≥ 𝑢 𝑖 (𝑠𝑖 , 𝑠−𝑖 ), ∀𝑠𝑖 ∈ S and
Î
∀𝑠−𝑖 ∈ S−𝑖 , where S−𝑖 = 𝑗 ∈N, 𝑗≠𝑖 S 𝑗 is the set of all strategy
profiles for all individuals except 𝑖.
Definition 3. [40]: A strategy profile s∗ ∈ S is the dominant
strategy equilibrium if every elements 𝑠𝑖∗ of s∗ is the dominant
strategy of individual 𝑖 ∈ N .
Thus, if we can show that every individual of our game
G has a strategy that gives better utility irrespective of other
individuals strategies, then with the help of Definition 2 and
3, we can say that Proposition 1 is true.
Proposition 1. G has a pure strategy Nash equilibrium when
𝛼 > 𝛽.
Proof. Let us consider a 2-individuals simple matrix game as
shown in Table I with the mentioned strategies. For simplicity,
we consider Laplacian distance Δ that each individual can pass
in any timestamp.

(10)

Hence, rewriting (10), we get the followings:
𝑢 1 (𝑠1ℎ , 𝑠2ℎ ) ≥ 𝑢 1 (𝑠1𝑚 , 𝑠2ℎ ),
𝑢 1 (𝑠1ℎ , 𝑠2𝑚 ) ≥ 𝑢 1 (𝑠1𝑚 , 𝑠2𝑚 ).

(11)

Thus, 𝑠1ℎ is the dominant strategy of 𝑃1 . Moreover, for the
individual 𝑃2 , the utilities are as follows:
𝑢 2 (𝑠1ℎ , 𝑠2ℎ ) = 𝛼 log 𝑍 + 𝛽 log 𝑑2 ,

√︃
Í
where 𝑑˜𝑖 = 𝑗 ∈N𝑖 (𝑋𝑖ℎ − 𝑋 𝑗 ) 2 + (𝑌𝑖ℎ − 𝑌 𝑗 ) 2 .
The Nash equilibrium [38] is the most used solution concept
for a noncooperative game. Formally, Nash equilibrium can be
defined as follows [39]:
Definition 1. : A pure strategy Nash equilibrium for a noncooperative game G = (N , (S𝑖 )𝑖 ∈N , (𝑢 𝑖 )𝑖 ∈N ) is a strategy
profile s∗ ∈ S where 𝑢 𝑖 (𝑠𝑖∗ , 𝒔∗−𝑖 ) ≥ 𝑢 𝑖 (𝑠𝑖 , 𝒔∗−𝑖 ), ∀𝑠𝑖 ∈ S𝑖 , ∀𝑖 ∈ N .

(9)

𝑢 2 (𝑠1𝑚 , 𝑠2ℎ ) = 𝛼 log 𝑍 + 𝛽 log(𝑑2 ± Δ),
𝑢 2 (𝑠1ℎ , 𝑠2𝑚 ) = 𝛼 log(𝑍 − Δ) + 𝛽 log(𝑑2 ± Δ),

(12)

𝑢 2 (𝑠1𝑚 , 𝑠2𝑚 ) = 𝛼 log(𝑍 − Δ) + 𝛽 log(𝑑2 ± 2Δ).
Now,

As 𝛼 > 𝛽, so the following conditions hold from (13):
𝑢 2 (𝑠1ℎ , 𝑠2ℎ ) − 𝑢 2 (𝑠1𝑚 , 𝑠2𝑚 ) ≥ 0,
𝑢 2 (𝑠1𝑚 , 𝑠2ℎ ) − 𝑢 2 (𝑠1𝑚 , 𝑠2𝑚 ) ≥ 0,

(14)

Hence, rewriting (14), we get the followings:
𝑢 2 (𝑠1ℎ , 𝑠2ℎ ) ≥ 𝑢 2 (𝑠1ℎ , 𝑠2𝑚 ),
𝑢 2 (𝑠1𝑚 , 𝑠2ℎ ) ≥ 𝑢 2 (𝑠1𝑚 , 𝑠2𝑚 ).

(15)

Therefore, 𝑠2ℎ is the dominant strategy of individual 𝑃2 .
When there are 𝑁-individuals (𝑁 > 2) in the game, every
individual still has the same two strategies as in the case of
a 2-individuals game. However, the dimension of the game
matrix, which is actually representing the payoff of every
individual for each strategy, will be changed from 2 × 2 to 2 𝑁 .
The incentive of individual 𝑖 ∈ N (takes strategy 𝑠𝑖ℎ , without
considering others strategy), is given as follows:
𝑢 𝑖 (𝑠𝑖ℎ , . . . ) = 𝛼 log 𝑍 + 𝛽 log 𝑑˜𝑖 .

(16)

ACCEPTED ARTICLE BY IEEE ACCESS. DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040821

However, if the individual 𝑖 ∈ N takes the strategy 𝑠𝑖𝑚 , i.e.,
the individual visits some crowded place like market, shop,
train station, school, or other location, then a person may
come in close contact with many others. Thus, the incentive
of individual 𝑖 ∈ N with this strategy is given as follows:

6

period where 𝑇0 is the length of a time period in minutes.
Thus, we can denote the incentive of a time stamp 𝑡 𝑠 in a
particular day 𝑝 as follows:
∑︁
∑︁
𝑈 𝑡𝑝𝑠 (𝜹, 𝒅) = 𝛼
log(𝑍 − 𝛿𝑖 ) + 𝛽
log 𝑑𝑖 .
(18)
𝑖 ∈N

𝑢 𝑖 (𝑠𝑖𝑚 , . . . ) = 𝛼 log(𝑍 − 𝛿𝑖 ) + 𝛽 log 𝑑𝑖 ,

(17)

where 𝛿𝑖 is calculated from (2) and 𝑑𝑖 is measured from (4)
for that particular location. Moreover, 𝑑𝑖 < 𝑑˜𝑖 as these places
are crowded and individuals are in short distance with one
another. Hence, 𝑢 𝑖 (𝑠𝑖ℎ , . . . ) > 𝑢 𝑖 (𝑠𝑖𝑚 , . . . ) as 𝑍 > 𝑍 − 𝛿𝑖 and
𝑑˜𝑖 > 𝑑𝑖 for any individual 𝑖 ∈ N . That means, 𝑠𝑖ℎ is the
dominant strategy for individual 𝑖 ∈ N irrespective of the
strategies of other individuals in the game G. Thus, there
is a strategy profile 𝒔∗ = {𝑠1ℎ , 𝑠2ℎ , · · · , 𝑠 ℎ𝑁 } ∈ S where each
element 𝑠𝑖∗ is a dominant strategy. Hence, by Definition 3,
𝒔∗ is a dominant strategy equilibrium. Moreover, a dominant
strategy equilibrium is always a Nash equilibrium [40]. Hence,
the game G has always a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. 
Thus, Nash equilibrium is the solution of the noncooperative
game G. In this equilibrium, no individual of N has the
benefit of changing their strategy while others remain in their
strategies. That means, the utility of each individual 𝑖 ∈ S
is maximized in this strategy, and hence ultimately maximize
the utility of (6). In fact, incentivizing the social distancing
mechanism is promoting social distancing to each individual.
To this end, maximizing 𝑈 of (6) ultimately maximize the
original objective function of (5).
Moreover, the Nash equilibrium point has a greater implication on controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the society.
At the NE point, every individual stays at home, and that is
the only NE point in our game environment. So, if someone
gets affected by COVID-19, the individual will not go in
contact with others. Similarly, an unaffected individual has no
probability to come in contact with an affected individuals.
Unfortunately, the family members have the chance to be
affected if they don’t follow fair distance and health norms.
For calculating the utility of each player (i.e., individual)
𝑖 ∈ N in case of any strategy, the positional information of N𝑖
individuals who are in close proximity of 𝑖 ∈ N are necessary.
In order to obtain this information, each individual 𝑖 ∈ N
communicates with GPS satellite and it sends the information
of N𝑖 , ∀𝑖 ∈ N individuals to the corresponding
player 𝑖 ∈
Í
N . Hence, GPS satellite needs to send 𝑖 ∈N |N𝑖 | = 𝐶 |N |
information, where 𝐶 can be a fixed number to represent the
close-proximity individuals and equal for every 𝑖 ∈ N , as a
whole for |N | individuals. Thus, the complexity of the game
is proportional to the number of players |N | of the game, and
will not increase exponentially.

𝑖 ∈N

Hence, the amount of resources/money that is necessary to
incentivize individuals in a particular day, 𝑝 can be expressed
as follows:
𝑇𝑠
∑︁
𝑈𝑝 =
𝑈 𝑡𝑝𝑠 (𝜹, 𝒅).
(19)
𝑡𝑠 =1

Now, if we are interested to find the sustainability of
lockdown policy for a particular country till a certain number
of days, denoted by 𝑃, we have to satisfy the following
inequality:
𝑃
𝑃
∑︁
∑︁
𝑈 𝑝 ≤ 𝑅0 +
𝑟 𝑝,
(20)
𝑝=1

𝑝=1

where 𝑅0 is the amount of resource/money of a particular
country at the starting of lockdown policy that can be used as
incentive and 𝑟 𝑝 is the collected resources in a particular day,
𝑝, of the lockdown period. Here, 𝑟 𝑝 includes governmental
revenue and donation from different individuals, organizations
and even countries. Moreover, the unit of 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝑅0 and 𝑟 𝑝 are
same.
If we assume for simplicity that 𝑈 𝑝 and 𝑟 𝑝 are same for
every day and they are denoted by 𝑈˜ and 𝑟,
˜ respectively, then
we can rewrite (20) as follows:
𝑃 × 𝑈˜ ≤ 𝑅0 + 𝑃 × 𝑟.
˜

(21)

Hence, if we are interested to find the upper limit of sustainable days for a particular country using lockdown policy, then
we have the following equality:
𝑃 × 𝑈˜ = 𝑅0 + 𝑃 × 𝑟.
˜

(22)

Thus, by simplifying (22), we have the following:
𝑃=

𝑅0
.
𝑈˜ − 𝑟˜

(23)

˜ and 𝑟.
Here, the sustainable days 𝑃 depends on 𝑅0 , 𝑈,
˜
However, we cannot change 𝑅0 but government can predict 𝑟.
˜
Moreover, depending on 𝑅0 and 𝑟,
˜ government can formulate
its policy to set 𝛼 and 𝛽 so that individuals are encouraged to follow the lockdown policy. Alongside, we cannot
continue lockdown policy infinitely based upon the limited
total resources. Hence, the governments should formulate and
update its lockdown policy based on the predicted sustainable
capability to handle COVID-19, otherwise resource crisis will
be a further bigger worldwide pandemic.

The sustainability of the lockdown policy can be interpreted
by using the outcome of the Nash equilibrium point that is
achieved in the noncooperative game in Section IV.
The total amount of incentive a particular time period is

presented in (6). In a particular day, we have 𝑇𝑠 = 24×60

In this section, we assess the proposed approach using
numerical analyses. We consider an area of 1, 000 m × 1, 000

distributed. The value of the principal simulation parameters
are shown in the Table II.

Figure 3 shows the empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf) of incentives for different numbers of individuals.
The figure revels that the incentive values increase with the
increasing number of home quarantine individuals in all the
four cases. Figure 3a exhibits that the incentives are below

that the incentive of being below 38, 000 is 40% sure for 25%

the values are in between 42, 000 to 43, 000 for sure. The
incentives for 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% home isolation cases
are above 57, 000, 59, 000, 61, 000, and 63, 000, respectively,
with probability 0.60, 0.65, 0.65, and 0.80, respectively, as
shown in Figure 3c. Additionally, the same values are at

0.72, and 1.00 probabilities, respectively, which is presented
in Figure 3d.
The total incentive (averaging of 50 runs) for varying
percentage of home isolation individuals with different sample
size are shown in Figure 4. From this figure, we observe that
the total payoff increases with increasing number of home isolation individuals for all considered cases. The incentives are
578%, 571%, 571%, and 571% better from home quarantine
of 25% to 100% for 𝑁 = 500, 𝑁 = 1, 000, 𝑁 = 1, 500, and
𝑁 = 2, 000, respectively. Moreover, for a particular percentage
of home isolation, the total incentive is related with the sample
size. In case of 50% individuals in the home isolation, the
incentive for 𝑁 = 2, 000 is 97.08%, 42.50%, and 15.96% more
than that of 𝑁 = 500, 𝑁 = 1, 000, and 𝑁 = 1, 500, respectively.

parentage of home isolation individuals for different scenarios.
The figure exhibits that the average individual incentive increases with an increasing percentage of home isolation as the
deviation 𝜹 decreases and hence, the value of home isolation
incentive increases. For 𝑁 = 500, the incentive of 100% home
isolation is 85.25% more than that of 25% home isolation.
Moreover, in a particular percentage of home isolation, the
incentive decreases with an increasing number of considered
individuals as the social distancing decreases due to the more
number of individuals. In case of 50% home isolation, the
individual incentive for 𝑁 = 500 is 102.96% more than that
of 𝑁 = 2, 000.
Figure 6 shows the maximum possible lockdown period
for a varying number of individuals within a fixed amount
of resource 𝑅0 . The figure reveals that with the increasing

ACCEPTED ARTICLE BY IEEE ACCESS. DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040821

percentage of home isolation individuals, the maximum lockdown period significantly decreases for all considered cases.
The reason behind this is that the more individuals are in home
isolation, the more it is necessary to pay the incentives. With
a fixed amount of resources, a country with less individuals
can survive a longer lockdown period. With more percentages
of home isolation individuals, the number of lockdown period
is less, and possible of spreading of COVID-19 is also less.
Therefore, the governments can consider a trade-off between
increasing expenditure as a incentive and lockdown period.
For 1, 000 individuals, the maximum possible lockdown period
for varying amount of 𝑅0 and 𝑟˜ is presented in Figure 7.
The figure also illustrates that with the increasing percentages
of home isolation individuals, the continuity of the lockdown
period reduces for every scenarios. However, for a particular
percentage of home isolation individuals where total number of
individuals are fixed, a country can continue higher lockdown
period who has more am amount of resources, 𝑅0 . Additionally, 𝑟˜ also play an important role to continue the lockdown
period.

VII. D ISCUSSION AND L IMITATION OF THE STUDY
The limitations of the current study are summarized as
follows:
•

•

The governments are required to formulate and update
their lockdown policy over time while mitigating the
financial impact of COVID-19. From equations (20) (23) we observe that such a policy update requires significant financial planning and prediction of the government
revenue over a timespan while considering the socioeconomic conditions of the population. In other words,
the financial condition of the population has a considerable impact on the success of any distributed (i.e., less
government control) or centralized (i.e., strict government
control) lockdown policies.
The proposed noncooperative game solution provides an
analytical approach to attain the solution that keeps the
total deviation from home 𝛿 by an individual from a vast
population to the minimum for reducing the infection risk
of COVID-19. Besides, such a game solution provides a
tractable evaluation for the sustainability of the lockdown
policy. However, like the other mathematical models of
epidemic diseases (i.e., SI, SIR, SIRS, SEIR), incorporating the probabilities of infection and recovery for
COVID-19 in the noncooperative game setting is still an
open research question and requires further investigation.

To this end, in the future, we will further study a stochastic
game setting by incorporating epidemic cases as a dynamics
of Markovian for capturing the uncertain behavior of pandemic. In particular, the policy for the government-controlled
epidemic models will be analyzed by the multi-agent noncooperative reinforcement learning for coping with an unknown
epidemic environment. Therefore, the government/institute
will capable of taking a proactive policy measurement for
enhancing the sustainability of any kind of epidemic.

VIII. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have introduced a mathematical model
for controlling the outbreak of COVID-19 by augmenting
isolation and social distancing features of individuals. We
have solved the utility maximization problem by using a
noncooperative game. Here, we have proved that staying home
(home isolation) is the best strategy of every individual and
there is a Nash equilibrium of the game. By applying the
proposed model, we have also analyzed the sustainability
period of a country with a lockdown policy. Finally, we have
performed a detailed numerical analysis of the proposed model
to control the outbreak of the COVID-19. In future, we will
further study and compare with extended cases such as centralized and different game-theoretic models. In particular, an
extensive analysis between the government-controlled spread
or individual controlled spread under more diverse epidemic
models.
