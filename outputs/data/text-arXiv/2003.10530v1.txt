We propose a simple model for understanding the kinetics of corona virus transmission. Our model assume
spreading of corona virus can happen from one to another only, if someone without enough protection comes
close contact to a person carrying the corona virus. Therefore this virus spreads on a large scale within a short
time through chains of such events. Using our model we provide an estimation of the number of people aﬀected
by this virus within reasonable duration of time. We choose values of diﬀerent parameters of our model by nonlinear least square ﬁt of the real time data and we predict fate of this corona virus transmission using our model.

The current corona-virus outbreak is an ongoing global outbreak of corona-virus disease. The outbreak was
ﬁrst identiﬁed in Wuhan, China in 31-st of December 2019, and has since been declared as Public Health
Emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization [1, 2]. As of 9-th March 2020, over
114000 cases have been conﬁrmed in the entire world [4]. More than 110 countries, with major outbreaks
in central China, Italy, South Korea and Iran [3]. More than 4000 people have died, among those more
than 3100 in China and around 900 in other countries [3]. As of now no vaccine or speciﬁc anti-viral
treatment is available, though research is going on. Eﬀorts are aimed at managing symptoms and
supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include maintaining distance from other people
(particularly those who are sick) [7, 8] as it is understood that this virus spreads between people via
respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing [6]. Therefore research on corona virus has become an
urgent topic with practical signiﬁcance. In this paper we look at the theoretical aspect of this problem. As
very less information is available on corona virus even today, in the following we assume spreading of
corona virus can happen from one to another only, if someone without enough protection comes close
contact to a person carrying the corona virus. Therefore this virus spreads on a large scale within a short
time through chains of such events. Using this model we estimate the spread and possible cessation of
corona virus transmission. As the detailed mechanism of corona-virus transmission is not known yet,
therefore this is the only model possible. In our model, people are divided into three classes: ignorant
(those not aware of this virus -there number should be large at the initial stage) and let x(t) be the number
of such people at time t, spreaders (those who have this virus and are spreading it -this number should be
small at the initial stage) and let y(t) be the number of such people at time t) and stiﬂers (those who have
this virus but are not spreading it -they are isolated or under medication or dead -this number should be
smallest at the initial stage) and let z(t) be the number of such people at time t. All these three sub-classes
of people together are called ‘corona virus’ class and we expect this class to expand in time and we
assume all these additional people belongs to ’ignorant’ sub-class. There will be another class of
individuals who will not be an explicit part of our model are those who will never meet spreader or even if
they meet spreader nothing will happen to them (know how to protect themselves or are lucky not to meet
any spreader or are genetically protected!). Similar models are already available in literature in the context
of rumour transmission [9, 10]. In our model, spreader-ignorant contact will convert the ignorant to
spreader -, corona virus will be transmitted from the spreader to the ignorant, spreader-spreader contact
will do nothing and the spreader-stiﬂer contact will stiﬂe the spreader (stiﬂers are placed isolated at the
diﬀerent locations along with doctors, therefore meeting stiﬂers is equivalent to meeting a doctor ¬hence
when a spreader meets doctor, spreader will be isolated and called as stiﬂer). It is important to mention
here that increase in the number of stiﬂer is equivalent to increase in number of doctors or hospitals for
accommodating more stiﬂers, therefore spreader gets more chance to become stiﬂer. The total population
size at time t is denoted by N(t), where N(t)= x(t)+y(t)+z(t). The model is described by the following
system of coupled diﬀerential equations

(1)

When a spreader contacts an ignorant, the spreader transmits the corona virus with a probability and we assume that g(y) x
ignorant change their ‘corona-virus’ sub-class and becomes spreader during the small time interval from t to t + δt, where
2
g(y) is the incident rate, and is given by g(y)= ky/(1 + αy ). In general it is quite natural to assume the incident rate (the

rate of new infections) to be linear in the infected number y. At low values of y incident rate can be assumed to
be linear in y. But at high values of y, the number of ’corona-virus transfer’ contacts between the infected
individual and ignorant individual may reduce due to protection measures taken by the ignorant individuals.
Hence incident rate rate is expected to increase slower than linear in y. Therefore the use of non-monotone
function g(y) in the corona-virus transmission model is more realistic. The function g(y) is increasing when y is
small and decreasing when y is large. In Eq. (1), ky measures the probability of new corona virus infection and
2
1/(1 + αy ) measures the inhibition eﬀect from the protection taken by the ignorant individuals. It is important to
note that when α = 0, the non-monotonic incident rate becomes the linear incidence rate. The parameter k is the
probability of infection due to the corona virus and the parameter α describe the quality of protection taken by
the general people against this corona virus infection. Large values of α means more knowledgeable people who
can take quality protection against the corona-virus infection. Fig. 1 shows how g(y) changes with y for diﬀerent
values of k (denotes the rate of infection due to corona virus). The peak value of g(y) measures the maximum
corona virus inﬂuence. The higher, the probability of new infection, the larger the maximum corona-virus
inﬂuence. The smaller the probability of new infection, corona-virus transmission terminates very quickly. Fig.
2 shows the plot of g(y) changes with y for diﬀerent values of α (denote the protection taken by susceptible
individuals against the corona-virus). For larger values of α, the smaller the maximum is the inﬂuence of
corona-virus and the inﬂuence force decrease to zero within a short period. As we can see that by helping the
people with more protection against the corona virus, one can speed up the time at which the virus-transmission
reaches it’s lowest value. For a smaller value of α, the inﬂuence force due to corona virus can have reached their
maximum value s subsequently the inﬂuence force take very long time to decrease to zero. In Eq. (1) we
consider the following, when a spreader contacts a stiﬂer, the spreader is isolated and therefore spreader
becomes a stiﬂer. This can be understood by the fact that stiﬂers are placed in diﬀerent specialized hospitals and
the number of such specialized hospitals increases with increase in number of stiﬂer. With more specialized
hospitals i.e., with more expert doctors, the rate at which spreader become stiﬂer increases. Therefore we
assume that λyzδt spreader becomes stiﬂer during the small time interval from t and t + δt. In the above Λ
denote the number of new people added in the ‘corona-virus’ class (“births”) at all time and µ is the number of
people goes out of the ‘corona-virus’ class (“deaths”). We assume that newcomers in the corona-virus class, all
are ignorant and the emigration is independent of the ‘corona-virus’ sub-class (same rate for all three types), k is
the proportionality constant and α is the parameter that measures the ’inhibitory’ eﬀect. There are ﬁve unknown
parameters in our model i.e., Λ, k, α, µ and λ and also the initial conditions i.e., the value of x(t0), y(t0) and z(t0)
is not known. Also we do not have any reliable data for number of conﬁrmed corona-virus infected people for
ﬁrst 20 days, reliable data is available from 21-st day onward [5]. Therefore it is really diﬃcult to have a good
estimate of the value of x(t0), y(t0) and z(t0). So in the following we use 20-th day as the initial time of our
calculation i.e., t = 20 and ﬁnal time in our simulation is assumed to 500 days, which is reasonably long.
Therefore we will integrate the Eq. (1) from t = 20 to t = 500. Now the available real time data [3, 5] reports the
number of conﬁrmed cases of corona-virus infected people, which is nothing but number of stiﬂer, because after
conﬁrmation of the corona-virus infection, they must have been isolated from the rest of the world -so that they
won’t be able to spread this corona-virus to anyone, anymore. In the following we assume the initial condition,
i.e., the value of x(20), y(20) and z(20) are unknown parameters. Therefore now we have total eight unknown
parameters i.e., Λ, k, α, µ, λ, x(20), y(20) and z(20) and we need to estimate the values of all these unknown
parameters. This is done by performing a non-linear least square ﬁt of the real time data given in Ref. 5, where
we get the daily data of number of corona-virus infected people (with conﬁrmed corona-virus infection). We
assume those conﬁrmed people must have been isolated (so that they won’t be able to spread corona-virus) -we
call them as stiﬂer i.e., z(t) in our model. Therefore, we ﬁt the real time data of Ref. 5 with z(t) of our model.
Best ﬁt is possible for the following values of the unknown parameters. i.e. Λ = 31547 per day, k = 156 per day,
−9
α = 51.6, µ =5.86 × 10 per day and λ = 2138 per day, with the initial condition x(20) = 88355, y(20) = 8004 and
z(20) = 300. These values are used for obtaining results of all our numerical calculations related to spreading of
corona-virus transmission

have α =0.25, and the top plot is for k =1.0, middle plot is for k =1.5 and the bottom plot is for k =2.0.

Using Eq. (1) we get an the following equation for the total population N to satisfy
(2)
The solution of the above equation is given by

( )

(3)

Now if we assume N0 = x0 + y0 + z0 =Λ/µ, then we will get Nt = xt + yt + zt =Λ/µ, that means we will have
population of constant size -which is not the case for corona-virus transmission problem. Therefore
we will use the initial condition, which does not satisfy the above equation. Now we consider the
existence of equilibrium in system deﬁned by Eq. (1). The condition for equilibrium is (x =0,y =0,z = 0)
and this leads to the following three equations

(4)

One of the possible solutions of Eq. (4) is the trivial solution given by

-which is the case for corona-virus free equilibrium. This is the case where corona virus was never introduced into
the system, therefore this solution is not interesting to us! From this, we can see that there should be no people
either spreader or stiﬂer classes. To ﬁnd the other possible equilibria, we solve the above equation analytically and
ﬁnd the following solutions

The above two solutions are not accepted physically, since number of stiﬂer is zero i.e., z = 0. Now the other
possible solution is given by

(7)

This is the only solution where all variables x,y and z are nonzero, therefore it represent corona-virus persistent
equilibrium. In our numerical solution we ﬁnd that all variables reach these equilibrium value after a very long
time.
Fig. 3 shows how total number of people in the corona virus class N(t) changes with time. This ﬁgure shows that
N(t) increases with time and within 200 days approximately 6000000 people will be in the corona-virus class. Fig. 4
shows how total number of ignorant people x(t) in the corona-virus class changes with time. As N(t) increases, x(t)
also increases very fast. Almost 5000000 people will be in the ignorant class within 200 days. Fig. 5 shows how
total number of spreader people y(t) in corona virus class changes with time. . As N(t) increases, x(t) also
increases very fast. Almost 5000000 people will be in the ignorant class within 200 days. Fig. 5 shows how total
number of spreader people y(t) in corona virus class changes with time. Within a very short span of time the
number of spreader increases very sharply and reaches the maximum possible value and then it decreases and
ﬁnally it reaches almost zero value within 200 days (with the increase in awareness of the people). One can see
from the equilibrium values of y(t) that y(t) approaches zero, as α becomes inﬁnity. The larger value of α the more
knowledgeable people, they show good resistance against the spreading of corona-virus infection. The smaller
values of α people show fragility to corona-virus transmission. Fig. 6 shows how total number of stiﬂer people z(t)
in corona virus class changes with time. Initially this number was very small then it increase because some
spreader becomes stiﬂer. Our result predicts that within 200 days 400000 people will be identiﬁed as aﬀected by
this corona-virus. Fig. 7 shows how incident function g[y(t)] changes with time. Incident function represents the rate

−9
are Λ = 31547 per day, k = 156 per day, α = 51.6, µ =5.86 × 10 per day and λ = 2138 per day, with the initial
condition x(20) = 88355, y(20) = 8004 and z(20) = 300.

- therefore, the incident function approach a small values (less than 5) within 200 days. In Fig. 8, we compare our
results with that found in literature [5]. number of stiﬂer is represented by z(t). Hence the total number of coronavirus infected people identiﬁed in the entire world should be compared with z(t) of our model and this done in Fig.
8. Fig. 8 shows that our model ﬁts well with the available real time data [5]. Our model is quite general and is
applicable to any infectious disease. Diﬀerent diseases are expected to be modelled by diﬀerent set of parameter
values of Eq.(1). Therefore real time data is required for estimating diﬀerent parameter values of our model. To
validate our model we apply our model for understanding another type of corona-virus transmission i.e., the case
of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). It is a viral respiratory disease caused by the SARS coronavirus
(SARS-CoV). Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of SARS in southern China caused 8, 098
infected cases, resulting in 774 deaths reported in worldwide [13], with most of the cases in China and Hong Kong
[14]. No cases of SARS have been reported worldwide since 2004 [14]. We have found real time data for total 95
days starting from 78-th day [12]. We took ﬁrst 30 real time data and estimated all eight diﬀerent parameter values
of our model and result of our calculation is shown in Fig. 9. Our result shows that rate of new infection approaches
zero within 120 days, but in reality it happens after 160 days. But it is important to note that our prediction is based
on only 30 data points and it is reasonably good. Now we took ﬁrst 60 real time data and estimated diﬀerent
parameter values of our model and result of our calculation is shown in Fig. 10. Our result shows that rate of new
infection approaches zero within 150 days, but in reality it happens after 160 days. At last we took all 95 real time
data and estimated diﬀerent parameter values of our model and result of our calculation is shown in Fig. 11. Our
result shows that rate of new infection approaches zero within 160 days, which is what one expect from real time
data. Therefore, we can safely assume that if enough amounts of data points are used for estimating diﬀerent
parameters of our model, then the predictions using our model will be reasonably good. We proposed one simple
model to understand the transmission of corona virus. Our model explains real time data very well. Diﬀerent
parameters of our model, is estimated using the real time data taken from reliable resource [5]. Therefore the
prediction based on our model is expected to be reliable. Our model predicts that the rate of new corona-virus
infection will reduced to less than 5 per day, after approximately 200 days.
