Abstract
We propose the SH model, a simplified version of the well-known SIR compartmental
model of infectious diseases. With optimized parameters and initial conditions, this timeinvariant two-parameter two-dimensional model is able to fit COVID-19 hospitalization data
over several months with high accuracy (mean absolute percentage error below 15%). Moreover, we observed that, when the model is trained on a suitable two-week period around the
hospitalization peak for Belgium, it forecasts the subsequent three-month decrease with mean
absolute percentage error below 10%. However, when it is trained in the increase phase, it is
less successful at forecasting the subsequent evolution.

Key words: COVID-19 prediction; COVID-19 forecast; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; SIR
model; SH model; hidden variable; hospitalization prediction

Introduction

The SIR model [KMW27] is a simple compartmental model that is widely used to model infectious
diseases [Het00]. Letting S(t), I(t), and R(t) denote the number of susceptible, infectious and
Àô
removed (or recovered) individuals at time t, and letting SÃá(t), I(t),
and RÃá(t) denote their time
derivatives, the SIR model consists in the following three-dimensional continuous-time autonomous
dynamical system
SÃá(t) = ‚àí

Œ≤
S(t)I(t)
N

Àô = Œ≤ S(t)I(t) ‚àí Œ≥I(t)
I(t)
N
RÃá(t) = Œ≥I(t),

(1a)
(1b)
(1c)

where N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) is the constant total population and Œ≤ and Œ≥ are parameters. The
SIR model, and several (sometimes deep) variations thereof, have been applied in several works
to model the COVID-19 dynamics (see, e.g., [LGWR20, Atk20, Koz20, Nes20, CNP20, FP20,
CFP20]) with known limitations (see [RVHL20, BFG+ 20, WF20]). Sometimes, an SIR-like model
is used to make long-term predictions (see [BD20]). However, at the time of writing this paper, it
appears that studies are still rare (see, e.g., [SM20]) where the SIR model parameters and initial
conditions are learned on a ‚Äútrain‚Äù part of the available data in order to predict a ‚Äútest‚Äù part of
the data, making it possible to assess the prediction accuracy of the model.
In this paper, we adapt the SIR model to the situation where (i) S, I and R are hidden variables
but I(t) is observed through a ‚Äúproxy‚Äù H(t) = Œ±I(t), where Œ± is unknown but constant, and (ii)

not only Œ≤ and Œ≥ but also the total population N are unknown and have thus to be estimated.
In the context of the COVID-19 application, H will stand for the total number of lab-confirmed
hospitalized patients. The proposed adapted SIR model, which we term SH model, is given in (8).
It has two state variables (SÃÑ‚Äîa scaled version S‚Äîand H) and two parameters (Œ≤ÃÑ‚Äîwhich lumps
together the parameters Œ≤, N , and Œ±‚Äîand Œ≥).
We leverage the proposed SH model as follows in order to make hospitalization predictions.
Given observed values (Ho (t))t=ti ,...,tc , we estimate the parameters Œ≤ÃÑ, Œ≥, and the initial conditions SÃÑ(ti ) and H(ti ) of the SH model. Then we simulate the SH model in order to predict
(H(t))t=tc +1,...,tf for a specified final prediction time tf . This approach thus combines the areas
of parameter estimation (for obvious reasons), data assimilation (for the generation of the initial
conditions) and machine learning (for the train-test approach).

Data

In Section 6, we will use a COVID-19 dataset for Belgium1 that provides us with the following
data for t = ts , . . . , te , where ts is 2020-03-15 and te is 2020-07-15:
‚Ä¢ Ho (t): number of COVID-19 hospitalized patients on day t (TOTAL_IN column);
‚Ä¢ Eo (t): number of COVID-19 patients entering the hospital (number of lab-confirmed hospital
intakes) on day t (NEW_IN column);
‚Ä¢ Lo (t): number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital on day t (NEW_OUT
column).
The subscript o stands for ‚Äúobserved‚Äù.
We will also mention results obtained with a dataset for France2 where ts is 2020-03-18 and te
is 2020-07-17.

2.1

Discussion

In the data for Belgium,
there is a mismatch between Ho (t) and Ho (t ‚àí 1) + Eo (t) ‚àí Lo (t) for most
Pte
t and Ho (ts ) + t=t
E
o (t) ‚àí Lo (t) is significantly larger than Ho (te ). This can be due to the
s +1
patients who get infected at the hospital (they would be counted in Ho without appearing in Eo )
and to the patients who die at the hospital (they would be removed from Ho without appearing in
Lo ). In order to remedy this mismatch, we redefine Lo (t) by Lo (t) := ‚àíHo (t) + Ho (t ‚àí 1) + Eo (t).
For the French data, we sum the ‚Äúrad‚Äù (daily number of new home returns) and ‚Äúdc‚Äù (daily
number of newly deceased persons) columns to get Lo (t). Since there is no column for Eo , we
define Eo (t) = Ho (t) ‚àí Ho (t ‚àí 1) + Lo (t).
Several other COVID-19-related data are available. In particular, the daily number of infected
individuals, Io (t), is also reported by health authorities. However, a visual inspection reveals that
the graph of Io is less smooth than the graph of Ho . A possible reason is that Io is affected by
two technical sources of variation: the fraction of tested persons and the accuracy of the tests.
In contrast, the reported number of COVID-19 hospitalized individuals, Ho , is expected to be
much more accurate. Moreover, for the authorities, predicting H is more crucial than predicting
I. Therefore, as in [Koz20], we focus on H.

3.1

Models
Case hospitalization ratio

We assume that, for all t,
H(t) = Œ±I(t)

(2)

where Œ± is unknown but constant over time. In other words, (2) posits that a constant fraction of
the infected people is hospitalized.
Equation 2 is reminiscent of [CFP20, (3)], where the number of dead individuals plays the role
of H and Œ± is time dependent.

3.2

Observation models

We assume the following observation models with additive noise:
Ho (t) = H(t) + H (t)

(3a)

Eo (t) = E(t) + E (t)

(3b)

Lo (t) = L(t) + L (t).

(3c)

Assuming that the  noises are independent Gaussian centered random variables confers a maximum likelihood interpretation to some subsequent estimators, but this assumption is very simplistic.

3.3

Proposed SH model

Multiplying (1a) and (1b) by Œ±, and multiplying the numerator and denominator of (1a) by Œ±,
we obtain
Œ≤
Œ±S(t) Œ±I(t)
NŒ±
Àô = Œ≤ Œ±S(t) Œ±I(t) ‚àí Œ≥Œ±I(t).
Œ±I(t)
NŒ±

Œ±SÃá(t) = ‚àí

(4)
(5)

Letting
SÃÑ := Œ±S
Œ≤
Œ≤ÃÑ :=
NŒ±

(6)
(7)

and using (2), we obtain the simplified SIR model
Àô
SÃÑ(t)
= ‚àíŒ≤ÃÑ SÃÑ(t)H(t)

(8a)

HÃá(t) = Œ≤ÃÑ SÃÑ(t)H(t) ‚àí Œ≥H(t)

(8b)

which we term the SH model. (The ‚ÄúS‚Äù in this SH model can be interpreted as the number of
individuals susceptible of being hospitalized.) The SH model has only two parameters (Œ≤ÃÑ and Œ≥),
one hidden state variable (SÃÑ) and one observed state variable (H) with observation model (3a).
Note that, in the SH model (8), the number of patients entering the hospital by unit of time is
E(t) := Œ≤ÃÑ SÃÑ(t)H(t)

(9)

and the number of patients leaving the hospital by unit of time is
L(t) := Œ≥H(t).

Estimation and prediction method

The goal is now to leverage the SH model (8) in order to predict future values of H based on its
past and current observations (Ho (t))t=ts ,...,tc . To this end, we have to estimate (or ‚Äúlearn‚Äù) four
variables, which we term estimands: the two parameters Œ≤ÃÑ and Œ≥ and the two initial values SÃÑ(ti )
and H(ti ), where ti is the chosen initial time for the SH model (8). One possible approach is to
minimize some error measure between the simulated values (H(t))t=ti ,...,tc and the observed values
(Ho (t))t=ti ,...,tc as a function of the four estimands. However, the error measure is not available
as a closed-form expression of the four estimands, and this makes this four-variable optimization
problem challenging. We now show that it is possible to estimate H(ti ) and Œ≥ separately. This
leaves us with an optimization problem in the two remaining estimands Œ≤ÃÑ and SÃÑ(ti ), making it
possible to visualize the objective function by means of a contour plot.

4.1

Train and test sets

To recap, we have ts ‚â§ ti < tc < te . The provided dataset goes from ts to te . The test set is
(Ho (t), Eo (t), Lo (t))t‚àà[tc +1,te ] , and this data cannot be used to estimate the variables and simulate
the SH model. The SH model is initialized at ti , and we refer to the data (Ho (t), Eo (t), Lo (t))t‚àà[ti ,tc ]
as the train set, though it is legitimate to widen it to t ‚àà [ts , tc ].

4.2

Estimation of H(ti )

It is reasonable to believe that H in (3a) is small in practice. Hence we simply take
H(ti ) := Ho (ti ).

4.3

Estimation of Œ≥

We have L(t) = Œ≥H(t), see (10). In view of the observation model (3), we can estimate Œ≥ by a
ratio of means:
Ptc
Lo (t)
RM
i
.
Œ≥ÃÇ
= Ptt=t
f
t=ti Ho (t)
Several other estimators are possible, such as the least square estimator, or the total least squares
estimator which is the maximum likelihood estimator of Œ≥ for the iid Gaussian noise model (3).
Note that ti in the expression of Œ≥ÃÇ can legitimately be replaced by any time between ts and tc .
Only data in the test set, i.e., occurring after tc , are unavailable in the variable estimation phase.

4.4

Joint estimation of Œ≤ÃÑ and SÃÑ(ti )

We now have to estimate the two remaining estimands, namely Œ≤ÃÑ and SÃÑ(ti ). We choose the
following sum-of-squared-errors objective function
œÜ(Œ≤ÃÑ, SÃÑ(ti )) = cH

tc
X
t=ti

(H(t) ‚àí Ho (t))2 + cE

tc
X

(E(t) ‚àí Eo (t))2 + cL

t=ti

tc
X

(L(t) ‚àí Lo (t))2 ,

(11)

t=ti

where the c coefficients are parameters, all set to 1 in our experiments unless otherwise stated.
In (11), H(t), E(t) as in (9), and L(t) as in (10), are given by the (approximate) solution of the
SH model (8) in which (i) H(ti ) and Œ≥ take the values estimated as above, and (ii) Œ≤ÃÑ and SÃÑ(ti )
take the values specified in the argument of œÜ. In order to compute the required (approximate)
solution of the SH model (8), we use the explicit Euler integration with a time step of one day,
yielding, for t = ti , . . . , tc ‚àí 1,
SÃÑ(t + 1) = SÃÑ(t) ‚àí Œ≤ÃÑ SÃÑ(t)H(t)

(12a)

H(t + 1) = H(t) + Œ≤ÃÑ SÃÑ(t)H(t) ‚àí Œ≥H(t).

(12b)

4

Now that the objective function œÜ (also termed ‚Äúcost function‚Äù or ‚Äúloss function‚Äù) is defined,
we let the estimated (Œ≤ÃÑ, SÃÑ(ti )) be the (approximate) minimizer of œÜ returned by some optimization
solver.

4.5

Prediction of H

Recall that the time range between ti and tc is the train period and the time range between tc + 1
and te is termed the test period.
In order to predict the values of H over the test period, we apply the above procedure to
estimate the four estimand variables Œ≤ÃÑ, Œ≥, SÃÑ(ti ), and H(ti ), and we compute the solution H(t)
of (12) for t from ti to te . The prediction is then (H(t))t=tc +1,...,te . The discrepancy between
(H(t))t=tc +1,...,te and (Ho (t))t=tc +1,...,te reveals the accuracy of the prediction.

5.1

Alternative estimation and prediction methods
Successive estimation of Œ≤ÃÑ and SÃÑ(ti )

As an alternative to Section 4.4, we now present a method to estimate Œ≤ÃÑ independently. We do
not recommend this alternative, but it sheds light on the various forecast accuracies observed in
Section 6.
From (8a) and (9), we obtain
d E(t)
= ‚àíŒ≤ÃÑE(t).
dt H(t)
Since

d E

,
H2

this yields
Œ≤ÃÑ =

EÃá(t)
HÃá(t)
‚àí
.
2
(H(t))
E(t)H(t)

Hence a possible estimator for Œ≤ÃÑ is
bÃÑ = Ho (t + 1) ‚àí Ho (t) ‚àí Eo (t + 1) ‚àí Eo (t)
Œ≤
(Ho (t))2
Eo (t)Ho (t)

and, from (9), a possible simple estimator for the remaining estimand is S(t

bÃÑ We
We can now investigate how the  error terms in the observation model (3) impact Œ≤.
assume throughout that the errors in Ho (t + 1) ‚àí Ho (t) and Eo (t + 1) ‚àí Eo (t) are comparable.
Except at the very beginning of the outbreak, Eo (t)Ho (t) is considerably smaller than (Ho (t))2 ,
and thus the second term of (13) drives the error.
Consequently, the estimation of Œ≤ÃÑ should be the most accurate when Eo (t)Ho (t) is the largest.
This occurs slightly before the peak of Ho (t). This means that the estimation of Œ≤ÃÑ should be the
most accurate for a train period slightly before the peak. However, this does not mean that this
position of the train period gives the most accurate forecasts, as we will see below.
Let us consider the situation where the train period is located before the peak. Then the
bÃÑ ). At the initial time t , this does not
estimation of Œ≤ÃÑ is less accurate, and this impacts S(t

bÃÑ
impact the right-hand term of (8b) in view of the definition of S(t ). However, an overestimation
i

of Œ≤ÃÑ will induce an underestimation of SÃÑ(ti ) and, in view of (8a), a subsequent even stronger
underestimation of SÃÑ(t). Hence the first term of (8b) will be underestimated. As a consequence,
the peak in H will appear sooner and lower. The case of an underestimation of Œ≤ÃÑ leads to the
opposite conclusion, namely a peak in H that appears later and higher. In summary, the further
before the peak the train period is located, the more inaccurate the position and height of the
peak is expected to be.

5

Finally, let us consider the situation where the train period is located after the peak. Then
we can make the same observations as in the previous paragraph, except that predicting the peak
is now irrelevant. Moreover, we are in the decrease phase, where the first term of (8b) (which
involves Œ≤ÃÑ and SÃÑ(t)) is smaller than the second term (which does not involve these quantities).
Consequently, the possibly large estimation errors on Œ≤ÃÑ and SÃÑ(t) will only slightly affect the forecast
of H(t).

5.2

Alternative: joint estimation of the four estimands

An alternative to Sections 4.2‚Äì4.4 is to reconsider (11) as a function of all four estimands:
œÜÃÉ(Œ≤ÃÑ, SÃÑ(ti ), Œ≥, H(ti )) = cH

(L(t)‚àíLo (t))2 . (14)

t=ti

In (14), H(t), E(t) as in (9), and L(t) as in (10), are given by the solution of the discrete-time
SH model (12) where the parameters Œ≤ÃÑ and Œ≥ and the initial conditions SÃÑ(ti ) and H(ti ) take the
values specified in the argument of œÜÃÉ. Minimizing œÜÃÉ is a more challenging problem than mimizing
œÜ (11) in view of the larger number of optimization variables. It may be essential to give a good
initial guess to the optimization solver, and a natural candidate for this is the values obtained by
the procedure described in Sections 4.2‚Äì4.4.
In our preliminary experiments, we have found that this alternative does not present a clear
advantage in terms of the prediction mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results reported
in Section 6 are obtained with the sequential prediction approach of Section 4, unless otherwise
specified.

Results

We now apply the method of Section 4 (by default) or a method of Section 5 (when specified) to
the data of Section 2 available for Belgium (by default) and France (when specified).
The methods are implemented in Python 3 and run with Anaconda 2019.10. The code to
reproduce the results is available from https://sites.uclouvain.be/absil/2020.05.

6.1

Fitting experiment

We first check how well the SH model (8) can fit the available data for Belgium. For this experiment, we use the method of Section 5.2 with cE = cL = 0 in order to get the best possible fit (in
the least squares sense) to the Ho curve. The result is shown in Figure 1.
The fitting error is remarkably small (MAPE below 15%). For the French data, the fit is even
better in terms of MAPE (about 3%).
Note that the parameters of the SH model are constant with respect to time in our experiments.
This contrasts with [Koz20] where there are two phases, and with [Nes20] where the infection rate
is piecewise constant with several pieces.
We stress that Figure 1 tells us little about the prediction capability of the model. If the fit
over some period is bad, then predictions (i.e., forecasts) over that period can only be bad. But if
the fit is good (as it is the case here), the predictions can still be bad due to their sensitivity with
respect to the data preceding the to-be-predicted period. For example, a better fit (in the RMSE
sense) than in Figure 1 can be obtained with a polynomial of degree 8; however, its prediction
capability is abysmal.
In order to assess the prediction capability of the model, we have to learn the estimand variables
over a train period that we make available to the algorithm, use the learned estimand variables in
order to predict H over a subsequent test period (whose data is not available to the algorithm),
and finally compare the prediction with the data on the test period. This is what we proceed to
do in the rest of this Section 6.

6.2

Predictions from a train period around the peak

We start with a prediction experiment where the train period is around the peak. According to
Section 5.1, this is a promising location.
A contour plot of the objective function œÜ (11) is given in Figure 2. In order to make the
minimizer easier to visualize, the plot shows equispaced-level curves of log(œÜ ‚àí 0.99 œÜ‚àó ), where œÜ‚àó
is an approximation of the minimal value of œÜ. Based on a visual inspection, we choose (1e-5,1e4)
as the initial guess of the optimization solver. The optimization solver is scipy.optimize.fmin with
its default parameters.
The middle plot of Figure 2 shows (Ho (t))t=ts ,...,te (observed hospitalizations, gray solid line),
(H(t))t=ti ,...,tc (hospitalizations given by the model over the train period, blue dashed line), and
(H(t))t=tc +1,...,te (hospitalizations predicted over the test period, in red dash-dot line). In order
to give a sense of the sensitivity of the results, we superpose the curves obtained for three slightly
different train periods. The test MAPE for the three curves are 27%, 7%, and 8%.
The right-hand plot of Figure 2 shows the evolution of SÃÑ(t).

6.3

Predictions from various train periods

In Figure 3, we superpose the results obtained with various train periods of 14 days. The figure
corroborates the comments of Section 5.1.
In particular, if the train period is fully located before the peak, then the predictions are rather
inaccurate. Placing the train period around the peak gives excellent prediction results. When the
train period is fully located in the decrease phase, the estimation of Œ≤ÃÑ and SÃÑ(ti ) is seen to be very
sensitive, but this does not affect much the quality of the prediction of H(t).

Results for France

Figure 4 is the counterpart of Figure 3 for France. These experiments are also compatible with the
comments of Section 5.1. We also considered some departments separately, with similar results.
A disconcerting aspect is the evolution of the estimated Œ≥ as a function of the location of the
train period. In Figure 3 (Belgium), the estimation of Œ≥ is grouped around 0.08 for several train
periods. However, in Figure 4, the estimation of Œ≥ keeps decreasing, indicating that the daily
number of patients leaving the hospital is an increasingly small fraction of the number of patients
at the hospital.

Conclusion

The experiments in Section 6 have shown that the proposed method has a remarkably good fitting
capability over the whole available data, and also a remarkably good predictive value over certain
time ranges for the Belgian data. However, there are also time ranges where the prediction is
very inaccurate, and the accuracy is also found to be lower for the French data. The predictions
returned by the model should thus be taken with much caution. In keeping with this warning, we
refrained from displaying predictions beyond the end time of the datasets. The Python code is
freely available to make such predictions, but there is no warranty on their accuracy.
Another source of caution is that we cannot rule out the situation where the considered objective function would be multimodal. The optimization solver might thus get stuck in a local
nonglobal minimum, yielding a suboptimal fit of the train data and possibly a poorer prediction
than what an omniscient solver would achieve. Moreover, even if the objective function is unimodal, the stopping criterion of the solver may trigger before an accurate approximation of the
minimum is reached.
If the proposed model is used to guide prevention policies, then further caveats are in order.

We have seen that the estimation of Œ≤ÃÑ is very sensitive. Hence the proposed model can hardly
help assess the impact of prevention measures on Œ≤ÃÑ. Without knowing sufficiently accurately the
impact of prevention measures on Œ≤ÃÑ, we may not aptly use the model to predict their impact on
the evolution of the hospitalizations.
Yet another caveat is that it may be tempting to deduce from the excellent fit with a constantparameter model (Figure 1) that the evolution of the prevention measures over the dataset period
has had no impact on Œ≤ÃÑ. But the deduction is flawed. Indeed, in view of the comments made
in Section 5.1, the available data could also be very well explained with fairly large jumps in Œ≤ÃÑ
during the decrease phase.
In spite of all these caveats, the hospitalization forecasts returned by the method, and also
the evolution of SÃÑ(t), might be of practical use in the context of various disease outbreaks, e.g.,
for resource planning. To this end, it will be important to understand which specific features of
the COVID-19 outbreak in Belgium made it possible to forecast so accurately the hospitalization
decrease several months ahead.
