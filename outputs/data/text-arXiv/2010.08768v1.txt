ABSTRACT
In this paper we introduce ArCOV19-Rumors, an Arabic COVID19 Twitter dataset for misinformation detection composed of tweets
containing claims from 27ùë°‚Ñé January till the end of April 2020. We
collected 138 verified claims, mostly from popular fact-checking
websites, and identified 9.4K relevant tweets to those claims. We
then manually-annotated the tweets by veracity to support research
on misinformation detection, which is one of the major problems
faced during a pandemic. We aim to support two classes of misinformation detection problems over Twitter: verifying free-text claims
(called claim-level verification) and verifying claims expressed in
tweets (called tweet-level verification). Our dataset covers, in addition to health, claims related to other topical categories that were
influenced by COVID-19, namely, social, politics, sports, entertainment, and religious.

KEYWORDS

INTRODUCTION

In addition to being a medium for the spread and consumption
of news, Twitter has been shown to capture the dynamics of realworld events including the spread of diseases such as the seasonal
influenza [18] or more severe epidemics like Ebola [27]. Since the
first reported case of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in China,
in November 2019, the COVID-19 topic has drawn the interest of
many Arab users over Twitter. Their interest, reflected in the Arabic content on the platform, has reached a peak after two months
when the first case was reported in the United Arab Emirates late in
January 2020. This ongoing pandemic has, unsurprisingly, spiked
discussions on Twitter covering a wide range of topics such as
general information about the disease, preventive measures, procedures and newly-enforced decisions by governments, up-to-date
statistics of the spread in the world, and even the change in our
daily habits and work styles. With the great importance and spread
of COVID-19 information, misinformation and fake news have
infected the Twitter stream. An early study quantifying COVID19 medical misinformation on Twitter found that 25% of collected
tweets contained misinformation [20]. During COVID-19 pandemic,
we observed that misinformation stretched beyond spreading fake
and potentially-harmful medical information, to information that
can have adverse negative political effects (example: ‚ÄúIn light of
the unresponsiveness of Yemeni government to requests of evacuation from Yemeni students in Wuhan, Sultan of Oman orders their
evacuation.") and economical effects too (example: ‚ÄúKuwaitis boycott
AlMarai Saudi dairy company after reports on Coronavirus infected

employees."). Combating the spread of such claims and verifying
them becomes essential during this sensitive time.
In this work, we aim to facilitate research on misinformation
detection on social media during this complex and historical period
of our time by introducing an annotated Arabic dataset, ArCOV19Rumors, that covers tweets spreading COVID-19 related claims.
ArCOV19-Rumors extends ArCOV-19 [16], which is the first Arabic COVID-19 Twitter dataset with propagation networks, by a set
of 138 COVID-19 verified claims and 9.4K corresponding relevant
tweets that were manually-annotated to support both claim-level
and tweet-level verification tasks. Claim-level verification is defined
as follows: given a short free-text claim (in 1 or 2 sentences) and its
corresponding relevant tweets, predict whether the claim is true or
false. Tweet-level verification is defined as follows: given a tweet
containing a claim, detect whether it is true or false.
To our knowledge, no other Arabic dataset is made available
to support both claim-level and tweet-level verification tasks in
Twitter given the propagation networks of the tweets in general
and on COVID-19 in particular. Some related Twitter datasets were
recently released by Elhadad et al. [11] and Rayson [26]. However,
neither has the propagation networks of the annotated tweets, and
they both support solely the tweet verification task. Elhadad et al.
[11] annotated the tweets as true or misleading, however, they
were automatically annotated by their trained models, and the
performance of these models was not presented by the authors.
Rayson [26] released an Arabic misinformation dataset but it only
covers COVID-19 health-oriented tweets labeled as true, false, or
unrelated. Differently, our dataset covers in addition to health, other
types of claims that were influenced by COVID-19, namely, social,
politics, sports, entertainment, and religious.
The contribution of this paper is two-fold:
‚Ä¢ We construct and release1 the first Arabic dataset for misinformation detection over Twitter, covering both claim and
tweet verification tasks. It contains 138 COVID-19 verified
claims that scale to 9.4K labeled relevant tweets along with
their propagation networks.
‚Ä¢ We suggest and motivate several research tasks that can
be addressed using our labeled subset for misinformation
detection.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We present
studies related to COVID-19 misinformation analysis and datasets
in Section 2. The construction of ArCOV19-Rumors is presented
in Section 3. Several use cases supported by our dataset are discussed in Section 4. We detail the released components of the dataset
in Section 5, and conclude in Section 6.

RELATED WORK

Misinformation in social media is a continuously growing problem.
It is even more severe in times of tension such as the COVID-19
crisis. The negative effects and spread of misinformation about
COVID-19 triggered efforts to understand this phenomenon. Many
studies analyzed misinformation spreading in Twitter related to
COVID-19 [6, 14, 20, 29, 30]. Singh et al. [30] analyzed the spread of
five health misinformation over time. Shahi et al. [29] analysed false
and partially false tweets that have been previously fact-checked by
a fact-checking platform. Kouzy et al. [20] focused only on health
misinformation and analyzed tweets negating health information
by trusted sources (e.g., WHO). Cui et al. [7] and Hossain et al.
[17] published an English dataset for claim verification, and tweet
verification respectively, while Dharawat et al. [9] released a Twitter
dataset for health risk assessment of COVID-19-related English
tweets.
Similar to existing studies, we extended our raw Arabic COVID19 Twitter dataset, ArCOV-19 [16], to include manually-annotated
tweets to support both claim and tweet verification. ArCOV19Rumors is the first Arabic COVID-19 dataset that has the propagation networks (i.e., retweets and conversational threads) of the
annotated tweets. To our knowledge, there is no work that released
a large manually-annotated Arabic dataset for misinformation detection on COVID-19 at both claim and tweet levels. The closest
work to ours is that done by Elhadad et al. [11] and Rayson [26].
However, neither have the propagation networks of the annotated
tweets, and they both support solely the tweet verification task.
Claim detection and verification are widely studied problems in
general. Several non-COVID-19 datasets exist for claim detection
[21, 23, 31] and verification [8, 15, 24, 31], however, they either support English language [8, 15, 23, 24, 31] or Chinese language [23, 24].
There are few initiatives targeting Arabic online content, but they
support claim detection (i.e., rumor or non-rumor) [1, 2], tweet verification without propagation networks [11, 26], or tweet credibility
[10]. Another notable work is a shared task by CLEF CheckThat!Lab
for claim verification [3, 4, 13]. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first Arabic dataset that supports both claim and tweet verification on social media using the propagation networks.

METHODOLOGY

We extended ArCOV-19 [16], an Arabic Twitter dataset about
COVID-19 that comprises over 1M tweets. We labeled a subset
of ArCOV-19 tweets to support research on misinformation detection, which is one of the major problems faced during a pandemic.
We aim to support two classes of misinformation detection problems (with variants) over Twitter: verifying free-text claims (called
claim-level verification) and verifying claims expressed in tweets
(called tweet-level verification), covering two common use cases. To
that end, we need to collect COVID-19 verified claims, then, for
each claim, we need to find, in ArCOV-19, corresponding relevant
tweets, and finally, among the relevant tweets, identify those that
are either expressing the claim or negating it (to easily propagate
the veracity of the claims to them). In this section, we show how
we implemented that pipeline (Sections 3.1-5). In Section 4, we motivate and discuss a list of research tasks supported by that labeled
data.

3.1

Collecting COVID-19 Verified Claims

We manually collected a set of verified COVID-related claims from
two popular Arabic fact-checking platforms: Fatabyyano2 and Misbar.3 We identified 113 false claims and 18 true claims during the
period of ArCOV19-Rumors. We collect an additional 31 true
claims from the following sources:
(1) Verified Health Organizations: We retrieved, from ArCOV19, all tweets from Twitter accounts of the World Health
Organization (WHO), ministries of public health in Arab
Countries, UNESCO, and UNICEF. Then, we manually extracted some true claims from the retrieved tweets.
(2) English Fact-checking Platforms: We collected (and translated to Arabic) a few true claims from English Fact-checking
platforms: PolitiFact,4 Snopes,5 and FullFact.6
That yielded a total of 162 claims, 113 false and 49 true, that are
potentially suitable for our purpose.

3.2

Finding Relevant Tweets

For each collected claim, we manually constructed and refined a set
of search queries in order to retrieve all potentially-relevant tweets
in ArCOV-19 using Boolean search. To help construct our queries
and maximize our coverage, we considered keywords that appeared
in the social media posts, expressing the claim, provided as examples
by the fact-checking platforms, and we also utilized Twitter search
interface to find the best keywords that can retrieve tweets about
that claim. We then used the queries to search ArCOV-19. An
example is the True claim ‚ÄúTrump suggests injecting disinfectants
as a treatment for COVID-19‚Äù.7 We noticed that the claim and also
the tweet given as an example by Misbar fact-checking platform are
using two different Arabic words that present "disinfectants" namely
mutaharat (disinfectants in English) and mueaqamat (sterilizers in
English), so we used both in combination with either Trump or US
president as search queries.
For each claim, we filtered the retrieved tweets to discard the
non-relevant ones. This is conducted manually by one author of this
paper. Example of tweets that were considered relevant are tweets
expressing or negating the claim, tweets having multiple claims
including the target claim, tweets expressing advice, questions, or
personal opinions about the claim, or even sarcastic tweets about it.
Overall, more than half of the retrieved tweets were non-relevant,
yielding 14,472 tweets relevant to the collected claims.

3.3

Filtering Claims

After identifying the relevant tweets, we excluded some claims
for different reasons. We excluded claims that have no or only
one relevant tweet due to extremely-insufficient content. We also
excluded the ones (especially health-related claims) for which the
veracity changed within the period of the dataset (e.g., ‚ÄúPets do not
catch COVID-19‚Äù), or those for which there are still no clear evidence
with or against the claim (e.g., ‚ÄúBats are the source of COVID-19‚Äù).

3 https://misbar.com/
4 https://www.politifact.com/
5 https://www.snopes.com/
6 https://fullfact.org/
7 https://tinyurl.com/y4btakuw

Moreover, we discarded the claims that are not very specific, i.e., too
general (e.g., ‚ÄúMany Arab countries took security measures against
those who refuse to quarantine‚Äù). We eventually kept 95 false claims
and 43 true claims, a total of 138 claims. Those claims have a total
of 9,414 relevant tweets. The final set of claims is diverse and claims
fall under different categories, as the misinformation propagating
in Twitter during COVID-19 pandemic was not restricted to health.
In fact, only 45 of them were health-related. The rest are distributed
over social (38), political (22), religious (18), entertainment (9), and
sports (6) topical categories.

3.4

Annotating Relevant Tweets

(a) False tweet

After collecting relevant tweets for each claim, we need to identify
those that are expressing or negating the claim, so that we can
propagate the label of the claim to them. For each claim, one of the
authors of this paper labelled all of its relevant tweets by one of
three categories:
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúExpressing same claim‚Äù if the main (focused) claim in the
tweet is restating, expressing, or rephrasing the target claim.
This tweet then receives the same veracity of the target claim;
thus it inherits its exact label (whether true or false).
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúNegating the claim‚Äù if the main (focused) claim in the tweet
is negating or denying the target claim. The veracity of this
tweet is then the opposite of the veracity of the target claim,
i.e., it is labeled as true if the target claim is false, and viceversa.
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúOther‚Äù if the tweet cannot be labelled as one of the two earlier cases, e.g., expressing opinion or giving advice regarding
the claim.
Figure 1 illustrates three example relevant tweets of a false claim
translated as ‚ÄúThe Chinese President visits one of the mosques in China
and asks Muslims to pray to God to alleviate the pandemic‚Äù, which is
literally stated in the tweet shown in Figure 1(a), thus it is false. On
the contrary, the tweet illustrated in Figure 1(c) is denying the claim,
and thus is true. It is translated as ‚ÄúWhat is being circulated about
the Chinese President, apologizing to Muslims and visits the mosques
and asking them to pray because of the spread of the #Corona virus, is
totally incorrect. The video is old and dated back to 2016. Source: the
Chinese news agency CCTV ‚Äù. Finally, the tweet illustrated in Figure
1(b) is labelled as ‚Äúother‚Äù due to expressing multiple claims. It is
translated as ‚ÄúChina bans eating all wild animals and their trade due
to Corona Virus. The Chinese President visits a mosque in China and
asks the scholars to pray to alleviate the pandemic‚Äù.
It is worth mentioning that expressing or negating the claim can
be over an external link in the tweet, stated in an image, or said in a
video, rather than in the text of the tweet. This was considered while
annotating tweets. Providing such tweets in ArCOV19-Rumors
allows the development of multi-modal systems, that can use signals
in text, images, or videos, to make verification decisions.

3.5

Collecting Propagation Networks

We also collected the propagation networks (i.e., retweets and conversational threads) for each relevant tweet. The propagation networks for tweets that contain misinformation are essential to study
its spreading behaviour and can constitute evidential signals for verification. Figure 2 shows some replies to the false tweet presented in

(b) Other tweet

(c) True tweet

Figure 1: Example relevant tweets to a false claim ‚ÄúThe Chinese President visits one of the mosques in China and asks
Muslims to pray to God to alleviate the pandemic.‚Äù

Figure 1(a). We notice that some replies have a clear stance against
the claim. Moreover, one presents evidence that the tweet is false.
In addition to the replies, exploiting profiles of propagators can
play a significant role in verifying the tweet [22].

This video dates back to 2016

This video is old, approximately 3 years ago
There is no truth to the news entitled ‚ÄúThe
Chinese President visits the mosques and
asks Muslims to pray to God to alleviate
the Corona pandemic‚Äù. And the real video
of the Chinese President‚Äôs visit to the
Chencheng Mosque in Yinchuan is 4 years
ago, specifically in 2016 .

IMMEDIATE USE CASES

Table 1 presents a statistical summary of the labeled tweets in
ArCOV19-Rumors. We define two subsets of tweets. The first is
denoted as Claims Subset, which includes all relevant tweets of
the claims (labeled as true, false, or other). This is of high interest
since all tweets relevant to a specific claim can be used in verifying
it. The other is denoted as Tweet Verification Subset, which only
includes the relevant tweets that are either expressing or denying

the original claims, excluding the ones labeled as other. This is also
of high interest since each of those tweets is subject to verification.
The table indicates that, out of 9.4k labelled relevant tweets, 3.6k
of them are either true or false (constituting the tweet verification
subset); each is considered a separate tweet-level verification query.
We notice that the distribution of true vs. false tweets is balanced,
making it a good resource for training verification systems. We also
notice that a good portion of both subsets have retweets and replies,
indicating potentially-useful propagation networks. Accordingly
and based on the two subsets, our labeled data can support three
different misinformation detection tasks.

4.1

Claim-level Verification

This task is defined as follows: given a claim and all corresponding
relevant tweets (with their propagation networks), detect the veracity
of the claim, i.e., whether the claim is true or false. Many studies
worked on claim-level detection, i.e., whether the claim is a rumor
or non-rumor [2, 23, 25], and a couple of datasets were released
for claim detection but they are either English Twitter datasets [23,
31] or Chinese Weibo datasets [23]. There are some initiatives to
support Arabic claim verification but given useful Web pages [13].

4.2

posted, exploiting relevant tweets posted earlier allows verifying
the tweet as soon as it is posted, not waiting for its propagation
networks. Third, even if the target tweet has propagation networks,
relevant tweets might provide more evidence, hence improve the
verification accuracy.
The second variant, denoted as Early Tweet Verification, just puts
a time limit (or a deadline) on the verification by considering only
the tweets and propagation networks that were posted before the
target tweet.

DATA RELEASE

In summary, we release the following resources as ArCOV19Rumors dataset, taking into consideration Twitter content redistribution policy:8
‚Ä¢ Verified Claims: 138 verified claims, each labeled as true
or false.
‚Ä¢ Claims Subset: tweet IDs of the tweets relevant to the verified claims, each labeled as true, false, or other.
‚Ä¢ Propagation Networks of the Claims Subsets: which includes for each tweet in the claim subset:
‚Äì Retweets: tweet IDs of the full retweet set.
‚Äì Conversational Threads: tweet IDs of the full reply thread
(including direct and indirect replies).

Tweet-level Verification

This task is defined as follows: given a tweet (with its propagation
networks), detect its veracity, i.e., whether the tweet is true or false.
A plethora of studies addressed this problem [5, 19, 22, 24], and a
couple of datasets were released to support the task; however they
are either English Twitter datasets [8, 15, 24] or Chinese Weibo
datasets [24]. Addressing this task in Arabic has never been studied.
Existing studies for Arabic tweet verification mainly rely on the
tweet content [12, 26], or, additionally, the potentially-relevant Web
pages. [3, 4].
There are two other variants of this task that are also supported
by ArCOV19-Rumors. The first variant makes also available (to
the verification system) the tweets that are relevant to its target
claim but were posted earlier (with their propagation networks). To
our knowledge, there is no study that addressed this problem. This
is an interesting problem for several reasons. First, with the lack of
any propagation networks for a target tweet, a verification system
can still exploit the networks of the earlier relevant tweets. Second,
as time is really critical to debunk fake claims as soon as they are

Tweet Retrieval

This task is defined as follows: given a tweet that expresses a claim
(i.e., a tweet in the tweet verification subset), find all tweets that are
expressing the same claim. To our knowledge, this task is understudied; an exception is the work done by Shaar et al. [28] and
the task proposed by Barr√≥n-Cede√±o et al. [3] in CLEF CheckThat!
2020 lab; however, they focus more on claims than tweets and
they release English-only datasets to support this task. Solving
this problem helps in applications like finding previously-verified
tweets, or clustering tweets expressing the same claim, to avoid
re-verification. Another variant of this task aims at finding tweets
that are relevant to the claim expressed in the target tweet, i.e., not
necessarily expressing it, but just relevant to it. This can be useful
in verifying the claim as we discussed earlier.

Along with the dataset, we provide, in our repository, some pointers
to publicly-available crawlers that users can easily use to crawl the
tweets given their IDs.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we presented ArCOV19-Rumors, the first Arabic
Twitter dataset that supports both claim-level and tweet-level verification tasks given the propagation networks. We released 138
verified claims associated with 9.4K relevant tweets. Our dataset
covers, in addition to health, other types of claims that were influenced by COVID-19 namely, social, politics, sports, entertainment,
and religious. The limitation pertaining to our work is that each
tweet has been annotated by only one annotator. We plan to mitigate that by recruiting more annotators to attain better quality.
