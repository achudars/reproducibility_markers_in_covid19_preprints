Abstract. Starting with the power law for the total number of
detected infections, we propose differential equations describing the
effect of momentum epidemic management. Our 2-phase formula
matches very well the curves of the total numbers of the Covid-19
infections in many countries; the first phase is described by Bessel
functions. It provides projections for the saturation, assuming that
the management is steady. We discuss Austria, Brazil, Germany,
Japan, India, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland,
UK, and the USA, including some analysis of the second waves.

Key words: epidemic spread, epidemic psychology, Bessel functions

1. Our approach and findings. A system of differential equations
is proposed describing the effects of momentum management of epidemics , which is in this paper a set of reactive measures mostly based
on the latest total numbers of detected infections. The hard measures
are the key; the most important are the detection and isolation of infected people and closing the places where the spread is the most likely.
If their intensity and consistency are high enough, our model provides
projections for the saturation of the epidemic spread, followed by the
second phase, which is essentially a period of modest constant numbers
of new infections. The two-phase formula , the main output of this
paper, was tested well for the spread of Covid-19 in many countries.
The 1st phase is described by Bessel-type functions with surprisingly
high accuracy. The exactness of the corresponding formulas for the
2nd phase is even more surprising taking into consideration many factors influencing the management of Covid-19 in the later stages. The
figures from Sections 11, 12 demonstrate our ”2-phase solution” for
Japan, Israel, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and UK. The latter and
Sweden were the latest in Europe to reach the 2nd phase. The USA

was close to it, but it was still in phase 1, when it entered the second
wave of Covid-19. The second waves match out theory equally well.
The second phase is when ”hard measures” are relaxed or even abandoned. Self-isolation, wearing the protective masks and social distancing become the key. Such and similar soft measures reduce the transmission rate, but the 1st phase is the key for reaching the saturation.
Our formula for the total number of cases for the 2nd phase is
C tc/2 cos(d log(t)): t is the time, d reflects the intensity of ”soft” measures, and c is the initial transmission rate , which is as follows. The
initial growth of the total number of cases is ∼ tc , where c is mostly
from 2.2 to 2.8 for Covid-19, but reached 4.5 − 5.5 for Brazil and India.
The number of new daily infections becomes modest during phase 2.
Also, asymptomatic (mild) cases begin to dominate, which contributes
to diminishing the spread too.
Focus on risk-management. We attribute the similarity of the curves
of the total numbers of detected cases in many countries to the uniformity of the measures employed and to the ways people react to the
threat, more specifically, react to the growing numbers of infections.
The total number of cases is generally more reliable and stable than
other characteristics of Covid-19, though it depends. It is not really
important in our approach that they mostly reflect symptomatic cases
and are frequently underreported. As far as they influence the decisions of the authorities in charge and our own behavior, they can be
used. Our focus on the epidemic management resulted in algebraictype formulas for the curves of total cases, which explain very well the
surprising uniformity of such curves in so many different places.
We identify 3 basic types of governmental management. The countries in the first group are determined to reach ”double-triple digit
numbers” of new daily infections, which is our (A)-mode. The second
group is when the reduction of hard measures begins upon the first
signs of the stabilization of the daily numbers, even if they are high;
this is a premature switch to the (AB)–mode or (B)-mode for us. The
third group of countries is where ”hard” measures are not employed
systematically, which can be due to a variety of reasons, including insufficient medical capacities or political decisions.
Some measures are of course always in place: medical help, selfisolation of those who think that they can be infected, various selfimposed limits, and so on. We focus on active momentum management.
Testing our theory. Our research was organized as follows. The theory and its applications to mode (A), the most aggressive one, were
essentially completed around April 15 of 2020. Not too many countries
reached the ”saturation” by then, but the middle stages matched this

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

new theory almost with an accuracy of physics laws. The challenge
was to understand the later stages.
The parameter c, the initial transmission rate, can be obtained during the early stages; finding a, the intensity of hard measures, generally
requires the period till the ”turning point”. Assuming that the measures are steady, this can be sufficient for forecasting the spread, but not
always. For instance, a, c coincided for the UK and the Netherlands.
The latter reached the end of phase one after about 45 days (counting
from March 13), matching well our Bessel-type formula. This appeared
significantly slower in UK, which we attribute to the relaxation of the
”hard” measures there after the ”turning point”. It is even more visible
in the USA, where the middle stage perfectly matched our formula with
the smallest c we ever observed: 2.2. Then the measures were reduced,
phase 2 was not reached, and eventually the USA entered wave 2.
At the end of April, we saw some signs of the switch from mode (A)
to mode (AB) in the USA and UK. This is a transitional mode, where
the main measures are ”hard”, but the response to the current number
of infections is as in mode (B), not really ”aggressive”. The corresponding (AB)-curves, called w-curves in the paper, were calculated
for the USA, UK on May 5. The expected dates of ”phase-1 saturations” under the (AB)–mode were correspondingly May 30 and June
10 for these countries. This worked well for UK, but did not materialize
for the USA due to further significant reduction of the hard measures
approximately in the middle of May. The economic and societal impact of ”hard measures” is of course huge. However long periods of high
daily numbers of new infections obviously present significant risks.
Concerning the USA, a period of essentially constant, but high, numbers of new daily cases lasted for some time, mathematically, similar to
that in Sweden. However, when processing automatically all 50 states
individually, we found at the end of May, that about 22 states were
already in phase 2, which appeared sufficient to expect the general saturation at 09/19. This projection remained quite stable till the end of
June, when the changes with the policies in almost all 50 states toward
”opening” resulted in a very different scenario.
The number of the states in phase 2 quickly dropped from 22 only
to 8: Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island as of July 8. Then USA entered
the second wave at about June 15, with the starting number of total
detected cases about 2M .
The second wave. Upon subtracting initial numbers, the match with
the corresponding Bessel-type solution appeared very good for the 2nd
wave, with the transmission rates c comparable with those for the 1st
wave. This was expected in our theory. Our c is some combination

4

IVAN CHEREDNIK

of the transmission strength of the virus and the ”regular” number of
contacts in the considered area. A preliminary analysis of about 10
countries, shows that it can somewhat increase. The parameter a, the
intensity
of the ”hard” measures, certainly diminished significantly;
√
1/ a is essentially proportional to the time till the saturation. This
is not unexpected: the second wave of extensive lockdowns seems not
too likely.
According to our automated program, the spread of Covid-19 remained mild in Western Europe till the middle of July, though the
following countries had clear second waves as of July 8: Albania, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Kosovo, Luxembourg,
Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia. Also, Sweden,

Poland, Portugal and some other countries did not reach phase 2 at
that date. Then the number of new cases increased at the end of July.
We analyze in the paper the current second waves in Israel and the
USA. Among other factors, many schools were open in Israel in June
and quite a few summer activities for children were held in July-August,
which presumably contributed to the high magnitude of the second
wave there. This is more complex in the USA, especially because of
the ”unfinished” 1st wave.
Nevertheless, it appeared that the curves of the total number of
cases are very similar to each other in these countries, upon some natural rescaling. This uniformity and good match with our Bessel-type
solutions provide of course a confirmation of our approach. It is worth
mentioning here that it is not impossible that the measures can be not
that ”hard” for the second wave to have the same effect, though the
detection-isolation-tracing remains of course the key.
Our general theory remains essentially unchanged from its first posted
variant (April 13). However only now all its main features are confirmed
to occur in reality, including the second Bessel-type solutions, and the
significance of modes (B) − (AB). Let us comment on it.
The second, non-dominating, Bessel-type solutions explained some
”bulges” of the curves of total cases, during the early and middle stages
in many countries. Generally, all solutions of ODE, PDE must occur
when used for modeling. Mode (B) and the log(t)–saturation appeared
the key in the second phase. The (AB)-mode is not used much in this
paper, but creating ”forecast cones” is of obvious importance. Last
but not least, the fact that the Bessel-type formulas describe well the
second waves is a confirmation of our methods.
Classical theory. The solutions of the basic classical equation for the
number of infections of communicable diseases is with the exponential
growth of its solutions, which describes only initial stages of epidemics.
The growth is no greater than some power functions in time during the
middle stages, so these equations must be changed.

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

The equally classical logistic equations for the spread, as well as the
SIR and SID models, assume that the number of infections is comparable with the whole population, which was not really the case with
”major epidemics” we faced during the last 100 years. This is mostly
due to better disease control worldwide. The herd immunity is of course
of fundamental importance, but many epidemics were significantly reduced or terminated (well) before it had full effect.
Thus, we must firstly address the power-type growth of epidemics except for short initial short periods of exponential growth (if any). This
can be clearly seen with Covid-19 , including sufficiently long periods
of essentially linear growth of the total number of infections. And the
saturation happens well before the number of infected people becomes
comparable with the whole population.
We mostly associate this ”polynomiality” with some assumptions
on the distribution of infected people, a kind of local herd immunity:
infected people do not transmit the virus if surrounded by those infected or recovered. However some sociological and biological factors
contribute too; see e.g. [CLL, Ch1, Ch2].
Whatever the theoretical foundations, the power law of epidemics
must be the starting point of any analysis if we want our mathematical
models to be up to date, the challenges with Covid-19 included. Our
approach is entirely based on the differential equations that provide
the power growth. The key was to extend them to the ones that could
be used to model the saturation, which we see with Covid-19 and other
epidemics. Our formulas are not only accurate. They are simple and
depend on very few parameters: essentially, the initial transmission
rate c, and the intensities a, d of the measures for phases 1,2.
Behavioral aspects. There is a strong connection of our approach
with behavioral science, including behavioral finance. Our differential
equations are actually from [Ch1] devoted to momentum risk-taking ,
with momentum investing as the main application. The aggressive
management of type (A) from Section 2 is an almost direct counterpart
of profit taking from Section 2.6 of this paper. The measures of type
(B) are parallel to the investing regimes discussed in Section 2.4. The
key link to financial mathematics is that the price function from [Ch1]
is a counterpart of the protection function in the present paper.
Paper [Ch1] can be considered as some step toward general purpose
artificial intelligence, the most difficult and ambitious among various
AI–related research directions. Momentum risk-taking is a very universal concept. We even argue in [Ch1] that the mathematical mechanisms
we propose can be present in neural processes in our brain; see Section
1.4 there. The ways we manage risks real-time are of course related to
behavioral aspects of epidemics.

2. Two kinds of management. There is a long history and many
aspects of mathematical modeling the epidemic spread; see e.g. [He] for
a review. The present paper seems the first one where the momentum
management of epidemics is considered the cornerstone . To be more
exact, our c, the initial transmission coefficient, reflects the transmission strength of the virus and the ”normal” number of contacts in the
infected areas, so it is ”given”. However, the second parameter, the
intensity a of the measures, is entirely about the management. The
basic management modes are as follows:
(A) aggressive enforcement of the hard measures, where their intensity is directly linked to the current absolute number of infections;
(B) an approach when the average number of infections to date is
the trigger and the employed measures are of more palliative nature.
Hard and soft measures. To clarify, the main actions of type (A) are
testing, detection, and prompt isolation of infected people and those of
high risk to be infected, as well as closing places where the spread is the
most likely. Wearing protective masks, social distancing, recommended
self-isolation, restrictions on the size of events, travel restrictions are
typical for (B). The following is important to us.
Mathematically, the modes (A) are (B) are based on different ways
to respond to the total number of detected infections: the absolute
current number of infections is the trigger for (A), whereas the average
number of infections to date is the key under (B).
The (A)–type approach provides the fastest possible ”hard” response
to the changes with the number of infections. With (B), we postpone
with our actions until the averages reach proper levels, and the measures we implement are ”softer”. Mathematically, the averages are
better protected against stochastic fluctuations, but (B) alone significantly delays the termination of the epidemic, as we will show within
our model. There is an analogy with investing , especially with profit
taking: an investor either directly uses the price targets or prefers to
rely on the so-called technical analysis , based on charting averages.
Let us emphasize that by ”response” and ”actions”, we mean not
only those by the authorities in charge of the epidemic. Our own ways
of reacting to epidemic figures are equally important. We can ”monitor” the total number of infections and act accordingly, or mostly
”consider” this number divided by the time from day 1, some substitute for the number of new daily infections. For instance, when the
number of new infections is constant (even high), this can be acceptable for some. On the other hand, this means some steady growth of
the total number of infections, which can be troubling if these numbers
are already high. Epidemiology has strong roots in behavioral science,
psychology, sociology, mass and collective behavior; see e.g. [St].

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

Saturation. Both modes, (A) and (B), are momentum, responding to
the latest data. As we will see, both provide essentially the same kind
of growth of the total number of infections in the beginning: ∼ tc
in terms of time t and for the initial transmission rate c. The main
difference is that the solutions of the differential equations of type (A)
are quasi-periodic : asymptotically periodic functions in t multiplied
by power functions. This automatically grants sufficiently fast ”saturation”, which is reaching the first maximum. Then they cannot be
used for modeling the total number of infections: it always increases.
For (B), we have log(t)-quasi-periodicity, but it reveals itself only in
the late stages; it can be really seen with Covid-19 during phase two .
The periodicity of our solutions is not related to the periodicity of
the epidemic models based on seasonal factors, various delays and other
mechanisms of this nature; see e.g. [HL]. The periodicity and saturation we consider are entirely due to active momentum management.
The ”forced” saturation of this kind can be unstable. Reducing the
measures too much on the first signs of improvement is likely to result
in further waves of the epidemic, which can be very intensive. This
was expected theoretically and now it becomes a serious concern.
3. Power law of epidemics. Here and below we will assume that the
number of people perceptive to the virus is unlimited, i.e. we do not
take into consideration in this paper any kind of saturation when the
number of infected people is comparable with the whole population.
Accordingly, herd immunity and similar factors are not considered.
Also, we disregard the average duration of the disease and the durations
of the quarantine periods.
The total number of detected infections is what we are going to
model. This is commonly used; the corresponding data are widely
available and seem the most reliable.
For any choice of units, days are the most common, let Un be the
number of infected individuals at the moments n = 0, 1, 2 . . .. The
simplest equation of the epidemic spread and its solution are:
(1)
Un −Un−1 = σ Un−1 for n = 1, 2, . . . , and Un = C(1+σ)n
for some constant C and the intensity σ. Here σ is the number of
infections transmitted by an average infected individual during 1 timeunit, assuming that the ”pool” of non-infected perceptive people is
unlimited. The problem here is that the exponential growth of Un
can be practically present only during the early stages of epidemics,
especially with the epidemics we faced during the last 100 years.
An important factor ignored in (1) is that Un − Un−1 is actually
proportional to Un−1 −Un−p , where p is the period when the infected
people transmit the virus in the most intensive way. Switching to p as

8

IVAN CHEREDNIK

the time-unit, we arrive at Un − Un−1 = ρ(Un−1 − Un−2 ), where ρ is
essentially the basic reproduction rate R0 . One has: Un = C1 ρn + C0
for some constants C0,1 ; so the growth is still exponential for ρ > 1.
We are going to replace Un−1 − Un−2 by Un−1 /(n − 1) with some
coefficient of proportionality. This can be obviously done if Un grows
essentially linearly. Generally, the reasons for such a significant change
must be and really are of fundamental nature.
Some psychological aspects. Presumably, the linear growth of Un is
not really sufficient to force us, people, to change our behavior, even
with epidemics. However, we certainly begin reducing our contacts and
consider other protective measures if the trend seems faster than linear.
This is not only with epidemics. The question is what we mean by
”trend” and how we measure it, at conscious and subconscious levels.
The ratio Un−1 /(n − 1) seems almost perfect to represent it. Generally, (Un−1 −Un−2 ) gives this, but it may be not what we really use
in this and similar decision-making situations. First, such differences
or the corresponding derivatives are poorly protected against the random fluctuations of Un . Second, momentum decision-making is very
intuitive and sometimes entirely subconscious. ”Storing and processing” the prior U -numbers in our brain is more involved than ”keeping”
Un−1 /(n−1). Our brain can perfectly process the input like ”yesterday
number was Un−1 and this took (n−1) days”, though the mechanisms
are complicated. The concept of time is quite sophisticated.
Also, let us mention here that the actions of infected people or those
who think they can be infected become less chaotic over time and they
generally receive better medical help in the later stages, which reduces
the transmission of the virus.
Some biological aspects. The viral fitness is an obvious component of
σ. Its diminishing over time can be expected, but this is involved. This
can happen because of the virus replication errors, especially typical for
RNA viruses, which are of highly variable and adaptable nature. The
RNA viruses, Covid-19 included, replicate with fidelity that is close to
error catastrophe. See e.g. [CJLP, Co] for some review, perspectives
and interesting predictions. Such matters are well beyond this paper,
but one biological aspect must be mentioned: asymptomatic cases.
The viruses mutate at very high rates. They can ”soften” over time
to better coexist with the hosts, though fast and efficient spread is of
course the ”prime objective” of any virus. For instance, quarantine
measures may ”force” the virus to stay longer in a host; mild strains
may have advantages. Such softening certainly results in an increase
of asymptomatic cases. Since we model the available (posted) numbers Un , which mostly reflect the symptomatic cases, the coefficient
σ automatically diminishes when the percentage of the asymptomatic

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

9

cases increases. Anyway, softening the virus over time contributes to
diminishing σ. We will provide more direct ”geometric” reasons for the
σ
switch from σ to n−1
below: some kind of ”local herd immunity”.
Master equation revisited. We arrive at the following equation for the
middle stages of epidemics , resulting in the power growth (asymptotically) of its solutions:
(2)

Un − Un−1 =

σ
Un−1 , n = 2, 3, . . . , Un ≈ Cnσ
n−1

for some constant C. When σ = 1, Un becomes exactly Cn.
Actually, it is not that important in this paper what are the exact
reasons for dividing σ by the time here, though we suggest some underlying principles. What is the key for us is that the switch from (1) to (2)
is a mathematical necessity; the exponential growth is unsustainable.
The power growth can be unsustainable long-term too, but such
growth is really present in epidemics, Covid-19 included, especially
during the middle stages. Needless to say that power laws are fundamental everywhere in natural sciences. We outlined some behavioral
and biological aspects above, but we think that the most plausible
explanation of the applicability of (2) is ”geometric”.
Equation (2) and its differential counterpart serve several seemingly
different ”situations”. One example is news propogation from [Ch1];
this is connected with the spread of epidemics. Let us discuss briefly
two other examples where the same equation is applicable; they are
from [Ch1] too.
Tree growth. Equation (2) reasonably describes the height Un of a
tree in year n at least for σ ≈ 1. The division of Un−1 by (n − 1)
can be interpreted as follow. The radius r of the root system can be
assumed proportional to the tree radius. Therefore the root system,
which is basically flat, must provide nutrition for the whole tree which
is 3-dimensional. We obtain that the growth of a tree during one year
is essentially proportional to r2 /r3 = 1/r times its prior height, Un−1 .
The final assumption is that r is proportional to n, which essentially
means that the distances between consecutive tree rings are constant.
In the beginning and at the end of the life cycle of a tree, this can be
different. The volume of the tree can be rather r2 than r3 in the very
beginning, so the growth can be faster than polynomial. On the other
hand, the nutrition the root system provides becomes proportional to
Un−1
r rather than to r2 in the later stages. The corresponding term (n−1)
2
readily results in the saturation of the tree size, which is well-known
and used practically in bonsai.

Neural activities. We expected in [Ch1] that (2) can serve some basic
processes in our brain. The assumptions here are of geometric nature.
Let the number of neurons used for a particular task be Un at the
moment n. The neural architecture of our brain is obviously about
connections (axons) rather than about physical distances between neurons in the brain. Some auxiliary N -dimensional space is needed to
present the corresponding ”graph” as an image in RN where the distances provide the numbers of connections. Then its frontier (border)
is the main source of the expansion of this brain activity.
Assuming that the neurons involved in this task are uniformly distributed in the image of radius r, we obtain that Un−Un−1 is essentially
, where Un ∼ rσ for σ ≤ N . Finally, we assume
proportional to Un−1
r
that the radius r grows linearly in time.
Here σ ≤ N can be actually any number due to the shape of the
n−1
image in RN . We arrive at Un −Un−1 = σ Un−1
for proper σ. This model
is of course a gross simplification; in contrast to trees and epidemics,
we do not know much about the real processes in our brain.
Back to epidemics. Following the last example, we represent the population of some area perceptive to the virus as an image in some auxiliary RN ; the numbers of connections/contacts between people then becomes essentially proportional to the geometric distances between the
corresponding points. The infected individuals fully ”surrounded” by
infected people or those already recovered do not transmit the disease.
Geometrically, they are represented by the points inside the image.
Its boundary matters the most: these people are better positioned to
transmit the virus. In a sense, the herd immunity is reached inside
this image. As above, we assume that the points representing people
are distributed uniformly in the image and its radius is basically proportional to the time. We arrive at (2) with σ ≥ 2; if the contacts are
mostly between the neighbors then expect σ ≈ 2, though the intensity
of the contacts and the strength of the virus matter too of course.
The uniformity assumption we made is quite standard in physics,
say in theory of gases or statistical physics. As everywhere in natural
sciences, the simplicity and universality of the resulting equation are of
course important considerations. Note that in contrast to σ from (1),
the constant σ in (2) and in its differential version are dimensionless,
i.e. this equation remains the same if we change the time units. This
is significant: this constant serves as an exponent.
Recall that we discuss here the epidemic spread without any active
management. We see that the polynomial growth of the spread can
be ”deduced” essentially from one postulate of geometric nature: the
”frontier” contributes the most to the epidemic spread.

4. Hard measures. In the realm of differential equations, our starting equation (2) becomes as follows:
(3)

dU (t)
U (t)
= c
, where t is time and c replaces σ.
dt
t

We apply Taylor formula to Un − Un−1 , so c is ”essentially” σ; we will
use mostly c from now on.
We will model now the impact of aggressive protective measures.
The key is the introduction of some protection function P (t), the total
output of the measures.
It is some counterpart of the price function in [Ch1]. Essentially,
we have two types of measures: (a) isolating infected people, and (b)
general diminishing the number of contacts. The are ”hard” and ”soft”
measures, considered above, corresponding to modes (A) and (B); see
below and Section 2. Let us begin with the ”hard” ones.
Protection function. The main ”hard” measures are testing and detection of infected individuals, followed by their isolation and ”tracing”.
They are hard by any standards, especially if there are many cases and
the treatment is unknown, as with Covid-19.
Generally speaking, P (t) provides the total numerical ”output” of all
employed measures. Its derivative gives their productivity by definition.
For ”detection & isolation”, we are going to use the following natural
definition of P :
P (t) = 1c (the total number of prevented infections from 0 to t).
The primary measure here is testing ; the number T (t) of tests till t
is what we can really implement and control. The detection of infected
people is its main purpose, but the number of tests is obviously not
directly related to the number of detections, i.e. to the number of
positive tests , and to the number of resulting isolations.
The efficiency of testing is complicated to be measured directly. However, the number of positive tests can be mostly assumed a stable fraction of the total number of tests, especially during the periods of stable
growth of the number of total cases. When U (t) = γT (t) for some γ,
finding γ experimentally is not a problem. Accordingly, the system of
differential equations will be only for U and P .
We assume now that the effect of isolating infected people is approximately linear. More exactly, an infected person isolated at t• < t will
not transmit the disease to (t − t• ) people till the moment t (now).
This kind of ”linearization” is very common when composing differential equations; it does not mean of course that the solutions of our
equations will grow linearly.

12

IVAN CHEREDNIK

Thus, if the isolations occur at the moments
{ti }, then these infected
P
individuals will not infect P (t) = 1c i (t − ti ) people till t (now). If
the latter group of people were not protected, they would infect δP (t)
people from t to t + δ, assuming the transmission with the coefficient
c for them. So P (t) must be subtracted from dU (t)/dt.
Finally, c dP (t)/dt is the number of isolated people by construction.
We assume it to be α U (t), a constant fraction of all infected people,
def
isolated or not. This is another linearization. The coefficient a == α/c
is the intensity of the isolation process. We arrive at the system:
(4)

dU (t)/dt = c U (t)/t − P (t), dP (t)/dt = a U (t).

The quarantine period, mostly 14 days for Covid-19, the duration of
the disease and similar factors are disregarded here. However, they are
partially incorporated in (3) through c. Interestingly, such and similar
simplifications appeared quite relevant and provided high accuracy of
our modeling. We also completely disregard the stochastic nature of
epidemics in this paper. Random processes are supposed to be used in
a more systematic theory.
With closing factories, schools and other places of high risk, not all
people there would be potentially infected if they continued to operate.
The exact effect of closing (and then reopening) factories and other
places where the fast spread of the disease can be expected is almost
impossible to estimate. However statistically, this preventive measure
is actually no different from the isolation of infected individuals.
Other P -functions can be used here, but this particular one has a
very important feature: it does not depend on the moments of time
when the infected individuals were detected. If P (t) depends on {ti },
the required mathematical tools can be much more involved. Since
P (t) is actually for us to define, it makes sense to ”postulate” its main
mathematical properties needed to compose the corresponding differential equations; this will be done in (i), (ii) below.
We emphasize that the measures of type (A) impact U (t) in complex
ways: isolating one individual prevents a ramified sequence of transmissions. The ”soft” measures of type (B), to be considered next, are
simpler: they result in a kind of reduction of the c–coefficient.
5. Soft measures. These measures are different from ”hard” ones.
Wearing protective masks is a key preventive measure of this kind;
social distancing, considered mathematically, is of similar type. Now:
P (t) = the number of infected people who began wearing the masks
before t multiplied by the efficiency of the mask and the c–coefficient.

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

Using the masks for the whole population, infected or not, ”simply”
changes c ; no new differential equations are necessary. Let V (t) be the
number of infected people wearing the masks. Then V (t) ≤ U (t) and

κ = 1 if c0 = 0, i.e. if the mask is fully efficient for infected people who
wear it. The same consideration works for social distancing , with κ
being the efficiency of the corresponding distance.
An instructional example is when we assume that the fraction of
those wearing the masks among all infected people is fixed. If V (t) =
νU (t) for some 0 ≤ ν ≤ 1, then we have:
(5)

dU (t)/dt = c (U (t) − νU (t))/t + c0 ν U (t)/t = (c − ν(c − c0 )) U (t)/t.
I.e. this measure results in fact in a recalculation of the c–coefficient
under the proportionality assumption.
Generally speaking, the output of ”soft” measures is heavily based
on probabilities. However, we only need the following: the greater
intensity of any measure the greater the reduction of new infections.
So we ”allow” only one way to control the efficiency of a measure: by
changing its intensity . The exact mechanisms of its impact are not
really needed to know in this approach. Let us formalize this.
General approach. From now on, the intensity of a measure or several
of them will be the main control parameter. As we already discussed,
the greater the intensity, the greater the number of isolated infected
individuals in (A) or the number of infected people who use the masks
in (B). If this dependence is of linear type, which can be expected,
the corresponding coefficient of proportionality is sufficient to know.
Respectively, the exact definition of the protection function P (t) is
not really needed to compose the corresponding differential equations.
What we really need is as follows:
(i) the usage of P reduces dU (t)/dt, possibly with some coefficient
of proportionality, by P (t)/t for mode (B), the average of P taken
from t = 0, or directly by P (t) under the most aggressive mode (A);
(ii) the derivative dP (t)/dt, the productivity, is proportional to
U (t)/t under (B), the average number of infections from t = 0, or
directly to U (t) in the most aggressive variant, which is (A) considered
above.
Item (i) has been already discussed. Let us clarify (ii), which provides the productivity of the measures dP (t)/dt in terms of U (t).

14

The proportionality to U (t) for (A) and U (t)/t for (B) are the most
natural choices. Indeed, the effect of the current number of infections
on our actions can be either direct or via some averages. If the averages
are used, U (t)/t is quite reasonable, as we argued above, Mathematically, a relatively fast reaching the saturation requires mode (A) or the
transitional mode (AB), which is defined as follows.
We employ ”hard” measures as in (A), however follow less aggressive
”management formula” for dP (t)/dt from (B). I.e. this is really some
transitional mode. As we will see, the epidemic will end under (AB),
but the time to the ”saturation” will be longer than under (A). If only
(B) is used, this is uncertain.
6. Type (B) management. Let t = 0 be the starting point of
the management; so we can assume that P (0) = 0. The followdef
ing normalization is somewhat convenient: u(t) == U (t)/U (0) and
def
p(t) == P (t)/U (0), i.e. u(0) = 1 and p(0) = 0. Recall that U (t) and
P (t) are the number of infections at the moment t and the corresponding value of the P -function. Here P is naturally for the sum of all
measures in the considered mode, the sum of their P -functions.
Obviously mode (A) is significantly more aggressive than (B). Philosophically, the smaller interference in natural processes, which is under
(B), the better: the effect will last longer. But with epidemics, we
cannot afford waiting too long.
Type (B) equations. As it was stated in Section 4, we couple (i) of
type (B), which is relation (5), with (ii) for the same mode. I.e. the
derivative of u(t) will be ”adjusted” by −p(t)/t and, correspondingly,
the rate of change of p will be taken proportional to u(t)/t. This means
that the impact of u(t) to p(t) and vice versa goes through the averages ;
i.e. the response to u(t) is not ”immediate” as in (A).
Note that the exact −p(t)/t (later, −p(t)) in the equation for du(t)/dt,
i.e. without a coefficient of proportionality, is a matter of normalization. This coefficient can and will be ”moved” to the second equation.
The equations under (B) become as follows:
u(t) p(t)
du(t)

Here c is the initial transmission coefficient, and a is the intensity

Substituting√u(t) = tr , the roots of the characteristic equation are
r1,2 = c/2 ± D, where D = c2 /4 − a. Accordingly, when D 6= 0, t > 0:
(8)
(9)

u(t) = C1 tr1 + C2 tr2 if D > 0 for constants C1 , C2 , and
√
√
c
u(t) = t 2 (C1 sin( −D log(t))+C2 cos( −D log(t))) if D < 0,

where the constants are adjusted to ensure the initial conditions. Note
that a proper branch of log must be chosen for t near zero.
So for a < c2 /4, the initial tc (for a = 0) will be reduced up to
tr1 with c/2 < r1 < c. When a > c2 /4, the power growth is always
c/2
of type
p t , and the period of sin and cos with respect to log(t) is
2π/( a−c2 /4). The corresponding ”saturation” is defined as the first
t such that du(t)/dt = 0; here tc/2 obviously contributes.
Positivity of du/dt. The control parameter a, the intensity, is actually
not arbitrary. To see this let us invoke v(t) = V (t)/U (t0 ), where V (t)
is the number of infected people wearing the protective masks. It was
used in the definition of P : P (t) = κcV (t), where κ is the efficiency of
the mask (from 0 to 1). We then have:
du(t)
u(t)
v(t) dv(t)
a u(t)
= c
− κc
,
=
.
dt
t
t
dt
κc t
Here v(t) ≤ u(t) by the definition. This inequality generally provides
no restriction on the derivatives. However, if v(t) is essentially proportional to u(t), there are some consequences. Let us assume that
v(t) ∼ γu(t). Then we obtain the relation: a = c2 κγ(1 − κγ). Ac2
cordingly, the maximal value of a is amax = c4 in this case, which is at
1
κ = 2γ
provided that 1 ≥ γ ≥ 21 . This gives D = 0 for γ = 1, i.e. this is
the case when all wear the masks of efficiency 1/2; then u(t) = Ctc/2 ,
which is obvious from to the definition of κ.
Generally, du(t)/dt ≥ c(1−κ)u(t)/t, since v(t) < u(t), and de
u(t)/dt ≥
0 for u
e(t) = u(t)tc(κ−1) . Thus the solutions u(t) from (8)&(9) qualitatively grow faster than tc(1−κ) due to (8).
(10)

Using the log(t)–periodicity (if present), the (B)–type saturation
points is the first maximum of u(t). We must stop using u(t) after
this, because it will begin to decrease. This (B)-saturation appeared
an important factor during the second phase of our ”2-phase solution”.
If the first phase, which is under (A), reaches its saturation and results
in a relatively small numbers of new daily infections, then mode (B)
will governs ”the rest”. The countries then almost automatically switch
to ”soft” measures. See Section 11.

7. Type (A) management. The most ”aggressive” model of momentum management is of type (A), described by system in (4). We
replace the average p(t)/t in (6) by p(t), and u(t)/t by u(t) in (7).
Actually, the first change affects the solutions greater than the second.

Quasi-periodicity. We conclude that for sufficiently big t, the function
u(t) is basically:

u(t) ≈ tc/2 A sin( at + πc/2) + B cos( at − πc/2) ,

for some constants A, B. So it is quasi-periodic , which means that
the periodicity is up to a power function and only asymptotically; the
asymptotic t-period is √2πa .
In our setting, u(t) must always grow, so du(t)/dt ≥ 0. The technical end of phase one is when u(t) reaches its first maximum; 2√π a
is a reasonable estimate, but not too exact. For instance, u(t) =

tc/2+1/2 J(c−1)/2 ( at) for c = 2.2, a = 1/5 reaches its first maximum
at about t = 4.85, not at 2√π a = 3.51; see Figure 1.
Transitional mode. It can be applicable to model the epidemic spread
when hard measures are certainly used, but are applied ”cautiously”.
This mode is transitional between (A) and (B): one replaces (12) by
dp(t)/dt = au(t)/t, but couple it with the equation for du(t)/dt from
mode (B), which is (6):
(16)

where we replaced u(t), a by w(t), b; the c remains unchanged. It was
called transitional (AB)–mode at the end of Section 4. Actually, this
mode is the part of the theory practically tested the least.
It is aggressive enough to provide the saturation, and better protected against fluctuations than (A). This makes sense practically; let
us see what this gives theoretically.
The system remains still integrable in terms of Bessel functions; see
formulas (2.20), (2.21) in [Ch1]. The leading fundamental solution is
√
w1 (t) = t(c+1)/2 Jc−1 (2 bt), where c > 1.
(17)
√
The second one is w2 (t) = t(c+1)/2 J1−c (2 bt). One has:

when t is sufficiently close to zero. Practically, they are ”almost” proportional with the coefficient calculated from (18) in sufficiently large
intervals of t, not only for t ∼ 0. This is important for forecasting.
1/2
The quasi-periodicity will be now with
√ respect to t and the corresponding asymptotic period will be π/ a. I.e. the process of reaching
the saturation is ”slower” than for (A), but still significantly faster than
for (B), where the ”mathematical periodicity” (if any!) is in terms of
log(t) in (9). This perfectly matches the qualitative description of (AB)
as a transition from (B) to (A).
Actually we have a family (AB)µ for −1 ≤ µ < 1 of such modes,
described by the system

Here the usage of the term p(t)/tµ means that the impact of one isolation of an infected individuals grows non-linearly over time, which
actually makes sense. Assuming that c > 2, the dominant solution is:

Connection to statistical framework. The solution tr for r = c of our
starting equation (2) is the square root of the variance V ar(B H ) of
the fractional Brownian motion BH (t) (fBM for short) for the Hurst
exponent H = r. It becomes r = r1,2 for the solutions from (8). Alternatively, the parameter r can be obtained from the self-similarity
property of fBM: Br (ts) ∼ tr BH (s). Qualitatively the connection with
our approach is that the expected (percent) growth of the epidemic
spread is essentially proportional to the standard deviation of the corresponding stochastic process. The important conclusion is that the
volatility of the spread is directly related to r, which of course can be
expected qualitatively.
One can try to introduce generalized fBM for the full solutions from
(9), or for our u(t), w(t) in terms of Bessel functions. See e.g. [Che] for
the theory of mixed fractional Brownian motion and its applications in
financial mathematics, which is related to our modeling here.
A more systematic way to link our ODE to SDE, Stochastic Differential Equations, is via the Kolmogorov-type equations for the transition
probability density ; see e.g. equation (1.7) from [Kat] for the definition
of Bessel processes. This is beyond the present paper. Obviously the
detailed analysis of our ODE and their applications for the spread of
epidemics, what we are doing in this paper, is necessary before we can
go to the level of random processes.
8. Using the u-curves. In the range till April 14 the graphs of our
solutions u(t) matched surprisingly well the total number of infections
in the examples we provide. The starting moments where when these
numbers began to grow ”significantly”; these moments are approximately around March 16 for the USA and UK, March 13 for Switzerland, and March 7 for Austria. Only u1 is used in this section.
Here and below, https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus is the
main source of the Covid-19 data; this site is updated at about 11:30

days/10. As for y, to improve the readability it will be always the
number of total (detected) cases divided by a proper power of 10.
The USA data. The scaling coefficient 1.7 in Figure 1 is adjusted
to match Figure 2 for the United States. For the USA, we set y =
infections/100K, and take March 17 the beginning of the period of
”significant growth”. Then c = 2.2, a = 0.2 appeared perfect in the
considered range.
Recall that c, the initial transmission rate, reflects the virus transmission strength and the way people respond to the current numbers
of infections. These numbers of course depend on the information provided by the authorities in charge and mass media.
The dots in all figures show the corresponding actual√total numbers
of infections. They perfectly match u(t) = 1.7 t1.6 J0.6 (t 0.2) in Figure
1. Accordingly, assuming the same intensity of hard measures, the
projection for the USA was: ttop = 4.85 (48.5 days from 03/17 till the
saturation at May 5) with utop = 10.3482, i.e. with 1034820 infections
(it was 609516 at 04/15). This did not happen; see below.

The saturation at t = ttop is of course a technical one, not the end
of the spread of Covid-19, even if it is reached. The data from quite a
few other countries demonstrated that some modest linear-like growth
of the total number of cases can be expected after ttop , and then the
second phase begins. The epidemic remains far from over.
With these reservations, our graphs and many others we considered
for Covid-19 demonstrate that Bessel functions describe very well the
first phase , the period of ”aggressive management” of type (A).

”Hard” measures are of course not the only force during phase 1.
They are always combined with ”soft” ones. There are other factors
and different stages. The graph for Switzerland is used to demonstrate
various stages during this phase in Figure 5 below.
Assuming that Bessel-type functions model well the period of the
intensive growth, one can try to ”capture” the parameters c, a before
or near the turning point of the epidemic. If a, c are known, the first
local maximum of the corresponding Bessel function times tc/2+1/2 gives
an estimate for the possible ”saturation”, the technical end of phase
1. This is of course under the steady (A)-type management, which
appeared the case in sufficiently many countries.
In the data we provide, a, the intensity of (A)–measures, is 0.2 for
the USA, UK, Italy and the Netherlands. It is 0.3 − 0.35 for Israel,
Austria, Japan, Germany; 0.1 for Sweden. The parameter c, the initial
transmission rate, is 2.2 for the USA, 2.4 for UK, Austria, Sweden, the
Netherlands, 2.6 for Israel, Italy, Germany, Japan; it reaches 4.5 − 5.5
for Brazil and India (with a < 0.05). Here c can be mostly ”captured”
during the early stages; a became ”reliable” later, when the management the epidemic reached some stability.
Covid-19 in UK. The coincidence of the red dots with our u(t) for
the USA could be because this was an average over 50 states. Let us
consider UK for the period from March 16 till April 15; see Figure 3.
Then c = 2.4, a = 0.2; the scaling coefficient is 2.2. The total number
of cases will be now divided by 10K, not by 100K as for the USA. The
increase of c to c = 2.4 qualitatively indicates that the ”response” of
the population to Covid-19 was a bit weaker in UK than in the USA

for this period, and/or the regular number of contacts was somewhat
greater. Though this is really some little change.
Recall that if the spread of disease is not actively managed, then
the growth ≈ tc can be expected, so c reflects the strength of the virus
and how we, especially the infected people and those who think that
they are infected, react to the numbers of infections before the active
management begins. Providing the numbers of infections, discussing
them by the authorities and in the media are some management too,
but passive. By ”active”, we mean the modes (A), (B) in this work.
The estimate for the ”saturation moment” was 5.17, i.e about 51
days after March 16, somewhere around May 6 with the corresponding
number of infections about 170000, assuming that the ”hard” measures
would continue as before April 15. The latter did not materialize.
Austria: 3/07-4/15. This is one of the earliest examples of a complete
phase 1. There is some switch to a linear growth around and after
the ”saturation”, typical in all countries that reached the saturation.
Modeling this period by Bessel function appeared quite doable, so the
management was steady and of type (A). See Figure 4.
Here we start with March 07; Austria began earlier with the protection measures than UK and the USA. The parameters a = 0.33, c = 2.4
and the scaling coefficient 3 appeared the best for Austria; we divide
now the number of infections by 1000, i.e. 14 in the graph corresponds
to 14000 infections.
Switzerland: different stages. We focus on the period March 13- April
12. As we have already discussed, (A) is supposed to dominate closer
to the turning point and then toward ttop . Mode (B) is present too,
but we mostly see in the figures the result of ”hard” measures.

Recall that only the total number of the detected infections is considered in this paper. The starting moment is t = 0. This is when the
intensive growth of power type begins, and also the beginning of active
management. It was around March 12 in Switzerland in Figure 5. The
first results of the employed measures can be seen around March 20 :
a transition of the initial (mostly) parabolic growth to the linear one.
Some ”free” spread of quadratic-type is present in practically all
countries in the early stages of Covid-19. Though in Brazil and India,
the initial growth was higher: ∼ t4.5 and ∼ t5.5 . The usage of Bessel
functions continuously (and automatically) diminishes the exponent
here during phase 1.
This is different for mode (B): the transition from the ”free” growth
u(t) ∼ tc to u(t) ∼ tc/2 cos(· · · ) is due to the increase of a from 0 to
a > c2 /4; then the exponent will stabilize even if a continues to increase.
Phase 2 is with a > c2 /4; The role of cos(· · · ) and sin(· · · ) in (9)
becomes significant and provides the ”final saturation”: the technical
end of the 2nd phase (and the 1st wave).
Let us briefly comment here on changing the starting point from the
absolute start of the epidemic to some t• . The equations will remain the
same, but c/t must be replaced by c• /(t − t• ) for the current c• . There
can be different stages of epidemics, so this can be necessary. Such a
split of the total investment period into intervals treated independently
is very common in stock markets. However, we do not change the
starting point t = 0 when switching from phase 1 to phase 2. The
corresponding (B)-type solution is considered as started from the very
beginning (though it is used only around and after ttop for mode (A)).

9. Main findings. The ”power law of epidemics” presented as a differential (initially, difference) equation is the starting point of our approach to momentum management. This law is different from other
power laws for infectious diseases; compare e.g. with [MH]. We deduce it from certain ”geometric” assumptions concerning the contacts
of infected people, a sort of principle of local herd immunity, and from
some behavioral and sociological analysis. The restrictions people impose themselves during the epidemic, mostly the reduction of their
contacts are related to the general theory of ”momentum risk-taking”
from [Ch1].
The main problem here is to ”couple” the power law of epidemics
with some mechanisms for their ending. These are major challenges,
biologically, psychologically, sociologically and mathematically. We
demonstrate that mathematically there is a path: Bessel functions serve
as a natural way from the power law of epidemics to the ”saturation”.
Our differential equations are based on various simplifications; however
their match with the real data appeared almost perfect.
The ”megaproblem” of understanding and managing epidemics is
ramified and interdisciplinary; significant assumptions are inevitable
in any models. We model only the period when the total number
of infections is significantly smaller than the whole population. We
also disregard the recovery and quarantines, though they are indirectly
incorporated in our differential equations via c and a.

24

IVAN CHEREDNIK

We fully aware of the statistical nature of the problem. The usage of
random processes, like Bessel processes, is reasonable here to address
the randomness around epidemics; see the end of Section 7. Some
combination with the traditional SIR model can be possible too; see
e.g. [CLL]. Our equations have natural ”logistic” extensions.
Saturation via hard measures. The main outcome of our modeling and
this paper is that the measures of ”hard type”, like detecting infected
people, followed by their isolation, and closing the places where the
spread is likely, are the key for ending an epidemic. Such measures
are a must for at least the initial and middle stages of the epidemic to
ensure the saturation in our approach.
Moreover, they must be employed strictly proportionally to the current number of infections, not its derivative of any kind, to be really
efficient. This is the most aggressive way to react, which we call mode
(A) in the paper. This can be seen in many countries, at least during
the middle stages of the epidemic.
Then the point ttop of the first maximum of the corresponding Bessel
function times tc/2+1/2 is a good estimate for the duration of phase 1;
it also gives some projection for the expected maximum of the number
of infections during phase 1. This is assuming ”hard measures” and
steady management of type (A). This formula worked very well for
middle periods almost everywhere and even for the whole period of the
extensive spread in the countries and areas that reached phase 2. It
seems a real discovery.
If the saturation is successfully reached at ttop , then the second phase
begins, which is essentially the switch to mode (B). Mathematically,
the curve of total cases significantly changes around ttop . This switch
can be clearly seen in many countries: frequently, a well-visible break
of the derivative.
The second phase is more challenging mathematically; it is heavily
influenced by economic, political and other factors. So it is even more
surprising, that it can be modeled with high accuracy using our system
of differential equations of type (B). See our graphs for Israel, Italy,
Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands in Section 11.
The quasi-periodicity of our u–functions under momentum management of type (A) and that under (B) in terms of log(t) is the key mathematical reason for reaching the saturation in our approach. This is
not connected at all with the periodicity of epidemics associated with
seasonal factors, biological reasons, or various delays; see e.g. [HL].
The saturation we model entirely results from the active management
and general ”response” of the population to the threat. Covid-19 is
exceptional in many ways, the scale and the intensity of the measures
used to suppress it are quite unique. The second wave , which can be

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

25

now observed in several countries, the USA, Israel, Japan, several in
Europe, and more of them, is a clear confirmation of the leading role
of hard measures. It really looks like the main ”control parameter” is
their intensity.
With this reservation about the source of our ”periodicity”, there is
some analogy with Farr’s law of epidemics. Under mode (A),√this is
some reflection symmetry of du(t)/dt for u(t) = tc/2+1/2 J(c−1)/2 ( at) in
the range from t = 0 to ttop , the first local maximum of u(t). The portions of the corresponding graph before and after the turning point are
not exactly symmetric to each other, but are close enough to this. See
e.g. Figure 1, where the turning point is at max{du(t)/dt}. This holds
for w(t), describing the (AB)–mode, but the second ”half” becomes
somewhat longer than the first. This is for the first phase.
The second phase. Mode (B) is the usage of the average u(t)/t instead of u(t) and relying mostly on ”soft” measures, like wearing protective masks and social distancing. Closing schools is certainly a hard
measure by any standards, and a very important one. Some travel
restrictions are ”hard” too. Self-imposed limitations are of course important too, and can be quite hard. They can significantly complement
the governmental management, as occurred many times in the history
of epidemics.
When used alone, soft measures are generally insufficient to ”reach
zero”, which follows mathematically from our model. However, the
usage of ”hard measures” combined with the response based on u(t)/t
instead of u(t) can work reasonably quickly toward the saturation; this
is mode (AB).
The best way to address the late stages appeared our ”two-phase
solution”. Since the hard measures are reduced or even abandoned at
the end of phase 1 (or even before), we switch from mode (A) to (B).
This can be seen in quite a few countries that reached the ”saturation”.
There is a clear linear-type pattern around the ”technical saturation”,
which is ttop , the point of maximum of our Bessel-type u(t). Then the
c/2
total number of detected
√ infections closely follows Ct cos(d log(t)
for some C and d = −D from (7),(9). Here c is the exponent of
the initial power growth of u(t); it remains the same for any modes,
(A), (B) or (AB). As for d, it must be adjusted numerically to match
the shape of the curve of the actual number of total cases near and
after the saturation; C is a (constant) rescaling coefficient.
This formula describes the late stages with surprising accuracy in
almost all countries that entered phase 2; there are already quite a
few, for instance, almost all Western Europe by now. The usage of our
two-phase solution is less relevant for the countries that begin reducing

26

or abandoning hard measures upon the first signs of the stabilization
of new daily cases or implement hard measures insufficiently. This
includes some countries, as UK and the USA, with solid type (A) response during the initial and middle stages. See Section 10; the USA
(as the whole) did not reach the end of phase 1 before switching to the
second wave.
If the period of linear growth becomes long, then d in cos(d log(t))
can be more difficult to find. Such long periods of linear growth of the
total number of detected infections were typical for the countries that
do not employ ”hard” measures systematically, like Sweden. These
measures are present in some forms anywhere, but this can be insufficient. The growth of the number of total cases can be significantly
faster than linear for sufficiently long periods, which can be due to
a variety of factors, including insufficient detection-isolation capacities
and some general weakness of the health-care systems; Brazil and India
are examples.
The risks of recurrence. The recurrence of epidemics is a clear challenge for microbiology, epidemiology and population genetics; very
much depends on the type of virus. The ”natural” c–coefficient reflects both, the transmission strength of the virus and the ”normal”
intensity of our contacts. The second component is likely to return
back to normal after the epidemic is considered ”almost finished”. If
the ”microbiological component” remains essentially the same as it was
before, the recurrence of the epidemic is almost inevitable after the protection measures are removed. The recurrence of the epidemic becomes
a sort of ”cost” of our aggressive interference in its natural course.
The whole purpose of aggressive management, mode (A) in our approach, is to keep daily new case at reasonably small levels. Then
detection-isolation-tracing becomes much simpler and the pressure on
medical facilities reduces. However the ”saturation” in one place is of
course not the end of the epidemic. New clusters of infections are likely
to emerge, and the epidemic suppressed in one area can still continue
in other places.
These are real risks. The economic and other ”costs” of hard measures are very high. It is understandably easy to ”forget” that the turning point and the saturation were achieved reasonably quickly mostly
due to the hard measures imposed. The corresponding underlying
mathematical processes have a strong tendency to become periodic,
which can ”play against us” as we approach the end of the epidemic.
Unless the herd immunity is reached or the virus lost its strength,
”restarting” the epidemic with few infected individuals left after the
previous cycle is standard. Significant numbers of those recovered and

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

27

the asymptomatic cases provide some protection, but it can be insufficient. For the next cycle(s), our better preparedness can be expected,
which can diminish c. However this is not confirmed so far in the countries with 2nd waves; there are obvious problems with restarting hard
measure, including keeping schools close.
Finally, let us emphasize that our differential equations describe an
optimal momentum response aimed at diminishing the new infections
only under the following key condition. We assume that people and
the authorities in charge constantly monitor the numbers of infections
and momentarily respond to them in the ”most aggressive” way.
This is actually similar to the ways stock markets work. Professional
traders simply cannot afford not to react to any news and any change of
the stock prices, even if they seem random, temporary or insignificant.
Indeed, any particular event or a change of the share-price can be a
beginning of a new trend. Applying this to managing epidemics, we are
really supposed to closely follow the data. The ”flexibility” here is only
the usage of some average numbers as the triggers, as a ”protection”
against random fluctuations. This is exactly mode (A) versus ”more
defensive” (B) or (AB).
The table: (A) vs. (B). For convenience of the readers, let us provide
a basic table presenting the (A)-mode and the (B)-mode with some
simplifications. This is Figure 6. Recall that c is the initial transmission
rate, a the control parameter, which is the intensity of the management,
κ the efficiency of protective masks.
By ”Detections”, we mean the total number of detected individuals
till t, which is essentially proportional to the number of tests performed.
This is up to ”us” to control.
The response of type (A) is basically as follows: if the number of
infections doubles, then the rate of increase of tests must be doubled,
not just the number of tests. For (B), the rate of change of the measures
is assumed proportional to the rate of change of the infections. The
(AB) mode uses this kind of response for hard measures. So under
(AB), if the number of infections doubles, then the number of tests
must be doubled too.
This
√ kind of response will provide the quasi-periodicity with respect
to t, so the saturation will take longer than under (A), where the
quasi-periodicity is for t. However, the time till saturation under (AB)
(roughly, 1/4th of the period) is generally ”quite acceptable”. See
Section 10 below and Sections 4, 5.
Recall that the key hard measure is testing & detection & isolation,
followed by tracing. Also, we use only the total numbers of detected
infections, without ”subtracting” the closed cases.

Switching to (B) in the table, by ”Masks used”, we mean the total
number of infected people who began using the masks till t. If the
number of infections doubles, than the total number of masks must be
doubled too under (B), not the rate of change as for (A).
10. Unusual patterns. Our key finding is that the total numbers of
detected infections for Covid-19
√ can be described with high accuracy
by u(t) = C tc/2+1/2 Jc/2−1/2 ( at) during the initial and middle stages
of phase 1, which was practically in all countries we considered. This
is the period of intensive growth of the spread when the hard measures
are coupled with the most aggressive response to the changes of the
numbers of total cases. A typical example is Figure 1.
It appeared that the whole phase 1 was covered well by such functions if the (A)–mode was employed until the numbers of new detected
infections dropped to really small levels. South Korea, Austria, Israel,
Italy, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and many other countries (almost all Western Europe) did exactly this. Then ttop , the first zero of
du(t)/dt, is a reasonable estimate for the ”technical end” of phase 1.

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

To understand the usage of type (A) curves for forecasting, we determine the parameters a, c, C for the initial periods, the red dots ,
and then analyze sufficiently long test periods, the black dots , without
changing a, c, C. A challenge here is the usage of a, c, C obtained in
some early stages for forecasting the later ones.
This seems doable, if the hard measures are employed, and when the
management is steady, which was not (always) the case with Sweden,
USA, UK and some other countries. There were significant periods of
essentially linear growth of the curves of total (detected) cases in these
countries. In our charts, the black dots remained essentially linear
significantly longer than it was ”allowed” by the corresponding Besseltype u(t), based on the parameters obtained at earlier stages. In the
USA, the process appeared the most complicated from these 3 countries. Brazil and India also must be considered exceptional because
their c-coefficient are exceptionally high. By now (August 25), they
are still in the middle half of phase 1.
We note that the parameters a, c were the same for the Netherlands
and UK, and not too different for those for the USA. However, the
Netherlands reached phase 2 following the u-curve, as well as many
countries in Western Europe. So this was not about the values of the
parameters, but rather about significant changes with the management
of Covid-19 in the USA and UK.
One can expect the (AB)-mode to occur after the mode (A) is ”relaxed”. Actually, the moments of the change of the management can
be clearly seen in the graphs for the USA and UK. We found the corresponding w(t) curves of type (AB) matching the red dots and black
dots till these moments for these countries. We also calculated the wcurves for Israel and Sweden, some ”control group”; w(t) is not needed
for Israel, which reached ttop under our u(t), and the actual curve of
total cases for Sweden was not supposed to match u(t) or w(t).
Recall that mode (AB) is when the hard measures are still present,
but the response to the total number of infections becomes softer, as
under (B). For instance, if the number of new cases is essentially
a constant, even uncomfortably high, the testing-detection under the
(AB) will be essentially constant too. This is much more aggressive
with (A). Considering the (AB) mode is not necessary for the countries
that reached ttop under (A). For such countries, the passage will be from
(A) directly to mode (B), to the second phase.
The blue dots till 05/27 after the black dots were added to monitor
the usage of the w(t)–functions. They did not stay within w(t) for
Sweden and the USA, This was expected for Sweden, since no aggressive approach was implemented there at that time. For the USA, there
was another significant reduction of hard measures. UK ”managed” to

30

IVAN CHEREDNIK

stay within the forecast cone between u and w; its ”expiration” was
June 10. Then it entered phase 2, and the curve of total cases matched
well our ”2-phase solution”. Sweden eventually reached phase 2 too,
but this occurred significantly later.
When using w(t), the point tw
top , the (first) maximum of w(t), is
a reasonable upper bound for the ”technical saturation”. The prior
tutop = ttop then is a lower bound; we obtain some forecast cone.

The cone for the USA. The prior ttop = tutop for u(t) was May 5, with
a, c, C calculated on the bases of the data till April 16, marked by red
dots. It was under the expectations that the ”hard” measures would
be applied as in (A), i.e. as before April 16. The black dots represent
the control period. The challenge was to understand how far u(t) can
be used toward the ”later stages”. The match was very good for quite
a long period of time (the same with UK), but then the curve went
up, which we mostly attribute to the softening the management mode,
namely, relaxing hard measures. The ”response” of the population of
the USA to the threat noticeably softened too.
Whatever the reasons, the switch to w(t), describing the (AB)-mode,
appeared necessary. The trend was initially toward w(t) for the USA,

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

31

but then the blue dots ”went through” w(t). Generally, the test dots
can be expected to stay within the forecast cone , subject to standard
reservations: the usage of hard measures and steady management. The
cone was the domain between u(t) extended by a constant u(ttop ) for
t > tutop and the graph of w(u) till tw
top , which was approximately May
30, 2020.
The parameters b, D of w(t) where calculated to ensure good match
with red dots; c, the initial transmission rate, is always the same for
u(t) and w(t). The graphs of u(t) and w(t) are very close to each other
in the range of red dots. The above relation for C/D holds with the
accuracy about 20%.
The w–saturation value was around 1.6M, but mostly we monitor the
trend , the ”derivative” of the graph of black dots, which is supposed
to be close to the derivative of w(t) or u(t). See Figure 7. Some spikes
with number of cases are inevitable; it is acceptable if the dots continue
to be mainly ”parallel” to u(t) or w(t) (or in between).

expected 330K or below. These ”predictions” of course depended on
many unknown factors. However, some argument in favor of the stability of our model is that any spikes with the numbers of infections are
supposed to trigger additional actions of the authorities in charge and
increase our own protective measures. Such ”self-balancing” seems a
rationale for relatively uniform patterns of the spread of Covid-19 in
different countries.

Sweden: anti-forecast. Sweden is actually expected not to follow
our u(t) and w(t); this country did not follow hard ways with fighting Covid-19. We calculated w(t) to confirm this; see Figure 9. Its
expiration was approximately after 100 days (x = 10); i.e. the wsaturation was about June 15. We did not expect this saturation to
occur. Definitely some measure were in place in Sweden; for instance,
people readily contact the authorities with any symptoms of Covid-19.
However this did not change much the linear growth of the spread until
recently, when the country really did something to reduce the spread
(and the vacation period helped).

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

Israel: u(t) worked. Here the usage of u(t) was sufficient to model
the total number of detected cases till the ”saturation”, which occurred
almost exactly when u(t) reached its maximum. The black dots demonstrate well the ”linear period” after the saturation, which was essentially of the same type as in South Korea, Austria and quite a few
countries that went through the saturation. Nevertheless, we provide
the forecast cone calculated as above on the basis of w(t). In contrast
to the USA, UK and, especially, Sweden, the black dots are much closer
to the flat line started at the u-top, which was at t = 4.5 (April 26).
Brazil: 3/29-8/23. This is an ongoing process with high c and low
a. The initial parameters were determined for the red dots: from 3/296/22 with the starting number 3904 of the total cases. The black dots
(the testing period) were till 8/23, 2020. See Figure 11.
They parameters are a = 0.04, c = 4.47, C = 0.65, where we set
y =cases/10K. In contrast to the previous examples, we use u1 = Cu1
and the second (non-dominant) solution u2 = Cu2 :
√ 
√
u(t) = u1 (t)−0.35u2 = C tc/2+0.5 Jc/2−0.5 ( at)−0.35J0.5−c/2 ( at) .
The cone will not be provided, since the curve of real detected cases
is still within our u-curve. Note that the parameter a, the intensity of
”hard measures”, is very low, and c is quite large.

India. The parameters are even more extreme for India: a = 0.035, c =
5.2. This country is still in the period of polynomial growth of the
spread, as of August 25. The analysis of India is obviously important
to understand the future of Covid-19. We provide the corresponding

34

IVAN CHEREDNIK

u–curve. Recall that it is under the assumption that the ”hard” measures are used in a steady manner, which was the case in almost all
Western Europe, China, South Korea, the USA (during some periods),
and in several other countries. Also, a sufficiently high level of healthcare system and the uniformity of measures in the whole country are
necessary for the success of such measures.
Even when all these factors are present, the spread can be very intensive. This occurred in the USA, where the u-curve and w-curve served
well only the middle stages. In India, the parameters of the spread
were the most extreme among the countries we consider in this paper:
√ 
√
u(t) = C tc/2+0.5 Jc/2−0.5 ( at)+0.2J0.5−c/2 ( at) , c = 5.2, a = 0.035.
We set y =cases/10K in Fig. 12. The period we used to determine
the parameters was 3/20-8/23 (no ”black dots”). The starting number
of detected cases was 191, which was subtracted,
Actually, 0.0125(t+0.07)3.65 gives a good approximation for the main
part of the period; see Figure 12, where the graph of this function is
shown as brown. So this is really a period of (strong) polynomial
growth, but obviously not of any exponential growth. We never observed exponential growth of the number of detected infections with
Covid-19 beyond some very short initial periods.

11. Two-phase solution. Let us describe our two-phase model for
the total number of infections. It is from the beginning of the intensive growth of cases through the saturation ttop of the (A)–phase, and
from ttop till the ”final saturation” of the corresponding (B)–phase. It

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

35

works surprisingly well for the countries that managed to reach reasonably small numbers of new daily infections during the first phase; the
”forecast cone” and the (AB)–mode appeared unnecessary for them.
We determined below the parameters a, c, d, and the scaling coefficient C for the period till May 22 (2020). So all dots are red unless for
Israel, where we used a, c, C above found in the middle of April. The
epidemic is of course far from over, but the first ”wave” ended in these
countries; so no test periods, ”black dots”, were considered.
Recall that the parameters a, c, C are mostly obtained to ensure the
match for the intervals till the ”turning points”; d can be determined
only in the vicinity of ttop , if it is reached. The initial transmission rate
c, must be the same for (A) and (B) according to our theory.
The leading solution from (7) is uB (t) = CB tc/2 cos(d log(M
pax(1, t))),
√
(c+1)/2
where c is the one in u(t) = CA t
J(c−1)/2 ( at), d = aB −c2 /4.
The scaling coefficient CA , CB are adjusted independently; the intensity parameters a = aA and aB have different meanings too. In the
later stages, we assume that aB > c2 /4. Here M ax(1, t) is due to some
ambiguity at t = 0; anyway,
we use uB (t) only for t > 1. Here d equals
√
very approximately to a for considered countries.
Importantly, we start uB (t) at t = 0, though it is used only after or
around ttop . This results in the following
nice formula for the end tend

second phase, d = 0.6 and CB = 3.4.

Italy: 2/22-5/22. See Figure 14. The starting point was 2/22, when
the total number of infections was 17; in this paper, we always subtract
this initial value when calculating our dots. One has:
√
u1,2 (t) = 0.8 t(c+1)/2 J± c−1 ( at), u(t) = u1 (t) − u2 (t), and

uB (t) = 2.85 tc/2 cos(d log(M ax(1, t))), c = 2.6, a = 0.2, d = 0.5.
We use here the second solution u2 (t) from (14). For t ≈ 0, it is
approximately ∼ t, i.e. smaller than ∼ tc for the dominating solution
u1 . The top of the bulge occurs when u2 (t) reaches its minimum; which
is approximately at ttop /2, where ttop is that for u1 . Actually, we can
see similar bulges for Austria, Israel and in the Netherlands too, but
they are relatively short-lived and u1 appeared sufficient. The linear
combination u1 (t) − u2 (t) was found numerically; the coefficient of u2
is not always −1. Here and further in this section, u1 = Cu1 and
u2 = Cu2 for u1,2 from (14) with the same rescaling coefficient C,
found numerically.

Germany: 3/07-5/22. See Figure 15. We began here with the initial
number of total infections 684, which must be subtracted when calculating the red dots. This was the moment when the curve began to

Figure 15. Germany: c = 2.6, a = 0.35, d = 0.56.
It makes sense to provide the u–curve for the first phase in Germany
using only u1 ; Figure 16. We disregard the bulge in the middle of
phase one , which is actually similarly to what we did for Israel. The
parameters √are different: a = 0.2, c = 2.6, C = 1.7, i.e. now u(t) =
1.7t1.8 J0.8 (t 0.2).
For forecasting, u1 (t) seems the most reasonable to use regardless
of the bulges. We ”miss” the bulges, but then we mostly return to
the curve calculated with u2 , similar to what we observed above with
Israel. This remains essentially the same for Italy and Japan. Let us
give the corresponding parameters for the usage of u = u1 only: Italy
(c = 2.5, a = 0.1, C = 1), Japan (c = 2.6, a = 0.1, C = 0.9).
Practically, we always begin with using u1 only and obtain a, c, C for
the interval before or around the turning point, when the bulge (if any)
can be not really visible. Then they must be adjusted constantly, and
u2 can be added if necessary. The initial a, c, C are of course subject
to quite a few uncertainties.
Japan: 3/20- 5/22. See Figure 17. It was on top of some prior stage,
so there were already 950 (total) infections on March 20. The curve is
not too smooth, but manageable well by our 2-phase solution :
√
u1,2 (t) = 1.5 t(c+1)/2 J± c−1 ( at), u(t) = u1 (t) − 0.4u2 (t), and

was relatively late in the Netherlands; the number of the total case was

383 on 3/13, the beginning of the intensive spread from our perspective.
A small ”bulge” in the middle of the phase one can be seen here too,
but u1 appeared sufficient: the country perfectly reached the saturation
at ttop and then smoothly switched to phase two:
√
u(t) = 0.5 t(c+1)/2 J c−1 ( at), c = 2.4, a = 0.2,

To finalize, the best ways to use our curves for forecasting seem as
follows:
(1): determine a, c, C when the spread looks essentially linear;
(2): update them constantly till the turning point and beyond;
(3): expect the ”bulges” to appear and add the u2 (t) if needed;
(4): try to adjust the intensity of the measures to match u(t) ;
(5): at the turning point, determine b, D and the bound w(t);
(6): after the saturation at ttop , find d and switch to phase 2 ,
Generally, the data must be as uniform and ”stable” as possible.
Then underreporting the number of infections, the fact that these numbers mostly reflect symptomatic cases, and inevitable fluctuations with
the data may not influence too much the applicability of the u, w–
curves for phase 1, and uB for phase 2. ”Testing-detection-isolationtracing” must be of course continued non-stop; the recurrence of the
epidemic is a real threat.

12. Entering second wave. The second waves are supposed to occur (well) after the first ones. However this is not granted for Covid-19,
where the spread heavily depends on active management. Efforts are
needed to finish the first wave as quickly as possible to avoid building
the second wave on the top of the first. So there must be reliable tools
for forecasting during the second phase, which we actually have. Their
importance is clear from the example of the USA.

40

IVAN CHEREDNIK

As the whole, the country remained in phase 1, when the second
wave began. However, there was a sufficiently long period when many
states were actually in phase two. It was similar to Western Europe in
July, but all major countries there were in phases 2 in contrast to the
USA. However this appeared sufficient to predict the end of phase 2 in
the USA around 09/19, which forecast was very stable for sufficiently
long period. We used the following concept of ”interaction”.
Generally, all 50 states, must be considered separately; then the sum
of the resulting curves is the forecast. However, such a straightforward approach does not take into consideration that improvements in
one state positively impact the other ones. This is similar to stock
markets. For instance, the components of SP500 are supposed to be
modeled individually, however their interaction must be taken into consideration.
The simplest approach to the interaction is what we actually used
when taking the sums of two Bessel-type solutions, u1 and u2 . The
second (non-dominating) can decrease as far as the total u(t), a proper
linear combination of u1 and u2 , increases. Similarly, the superposition
of u–functions for different states or countries can be defined as their
sum where ”we allow” the components, modeling different states, to
decrease as far as the total goes up. Here the physics intuition is
relevant, but we will not specify.

The corresponding analysis required a fully automated system, which
was developed and will be made available. It produced the curves and
determined the status of every state ”without human interference”.
The first automated forecast for 50 states was based on the period
03/17-05/27; we use for our forecasts for the USA the data from the

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

41

site https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data . Every state was
processed individually. The red dots are the total numbers of detected
cases, as above.
Our program focuses on the last 20 days; however, the match with
the total number of detected infections appeared perfect almost from
03/17 and remained so for further auto-forecasts for a long period;
see Figure 19. Such a high level of stability is actually rare in any
forecasting, which made the chances to reach the saturation around
9/19 high, However, the hard measures were significantly reduced at
the end of May practically in all 50 states. As a result, the number of
states that reached phase 2 dropped from about 22 (at 5/27) to 8 (at
7/12). Then, in the second half of June the USA entered the second
wave. We provide the automated output of our program from 6/21,
one of the last before the curve of the total cases in the USA changed
dramatically.
The ”curve average” in this output is the maximum and the corresponding value of the average of 9 last curves uB (t) for the USA, i.e.
the moving average. The 9-day average is the simple average of the
corresponding maxima; see Figure 20.

Poland, Portugal and some other countries did not reach phase 2 at
that time. Nevertheless, the forecasts were sufficiently stable, though
with a tendency to increase. Such stability changed this fall due to the
end of the vacation periods and the beginning of the school year.
The saturation projections are of course of technical nature, certainly
not for the end of the spread . By design, the ”saturation targets” are
supposed to increase over time. Moreover, a modest linear growth of
the total number of detected infections is expected after the ”saturation”, if it was achieved.

Figure 21. The forecast for Europe as of 7/14.
In Europe, the second phase was stable for quite a long period, but
then the spread there changed significantly at the end of July, which is
very similar to the beginning of the ”hockey hook” in the USA shown
in Figure 20. The saturation target in Figure 22 still exists, but it
moved to December and is only of some symbolic value. Somewhat
later, the 9-day average curves became essentially linear: the vacation
period was over.
Second waves. We will focus on the second wave in Israel, where it
appeared of unexpectedly large magnitude, and in the USA, where it
began with a very large number of new daily cases due to the unfinished
first wave. The expectations were that the parameter c◦ for the 2nd
wave could be essentially the same as c for the 1st. This was based
on the assumption that the termination of the first wave was mostly
due to the ”hard measures”. So if they are reduced or abandoned, the
epidemic can be back with about the same parameters. It appeared
actually worse than expected: the intensity of hard measures during
the 2nd wave dropped significantly in Israel and the USA. It is not
impossible though that some lower intensity of hard measures can have
the same impact during the 2nd wave.

Figure 22. The forecast for Europe as of 8/02.
With Israel: c◦ = 2.75, a◦ = 0.1, C◦√= 4.8, and the corresponding
u◦ (t) = C◦ tc◦ +1/2 (Jc◦ −1/2 + 0.1J1.2−c◦ ( a◦ t); the parameters were determined for the period 6/13- 7/14 and served well till about 07/30,
when the change of the trend was similar to the transition from phase
1 to phase 2 we observed in quite a few countries. Then the number of
cases began to increase dramatically.
The starting value at 06/13 was 18875, the number of cases at 7/7
was 31K. The black (control) dots were added at 7/14. See Figure 23;
y = days/1K. The parameter c◦ is somewhat greater that c = 2.6 for
the first wave in Israel, and the intensity of hard measures, a◦ , is much
smaller
than a. The significant drop of a can be possibly expected;
√
1/ a is directly related to the duration of the wave.
We recall that the first wave in Israel matched well our u-curve, and
this wave was managed efficiently. This was under strict lockdowns.
The management of the first wave in the USA was not that steady.
Opening schools in August-September is one of the key unknown factors, but not the only one of course. Also, a significant increase of the
number of new daily cases in Europe at the end of vacation periods
was expected; this really happened.
The starting number of the total cases for the second wave in the
USA at 6/15 was 2.1M ; the red dots were till 7/14, and the control
black dots closely follow the u-curve till about 7/27. Upon subtracting
2.1M , one has: a◦ = 0.06, c◦ = 2.65, C◦ = 3.4,
√
u◦1,2 (t) = 3.4 t(c◦ +1)/2 J± c◦ −1 ( a◦ t), u◦ (t) = u◦1 (t) + 0.6u◦2 (t).
2

Here we use our second Bessel-type solution u2◦ , so the connection of c◦
with c = 2.2 for the first wave (obtained without u2 ) is not that direct.
We used u2 for Israel too, but its coefficient was small: 0.1.

Figure 24. Second wave in the USA: 6/15-8/23.
Generally, finding a, c, C in the early stages and using them for some
preliminary forecasting seems more reasonable without u2 , even if the
latter gives a somewhat better match with the ”red dots”. The usage
of u2 mainly addresses the presence of some bulges, i.e. some effects of
”second order”.
Generally, finding the optimal parameters which are stable enough,
requires at least passing the ”turning points”. This is fully applicable
to a, but the parameter c, the transmission coefficient in our theory,
can be seen well in the early stages.

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

45

We note that the presence of wave 1 can generally make modeling
wave 2 challenging mathematically. According to [Ch1], hypergeometric functions may be necessary. However, it appeared that simple subtracting ”the pedestal” from the first wave made the Bessel functions
sufficient to model the second wave in the USA: Figure 24.
The similarity of the curves of total cases in Israel and the USA
considered above is interesting. This is for the second wave and the
situations are very different in these countries. Nevertheless, the curves
almost coincide upon some rescaling. The second interesting feature is
that we see at the end of July a pattern in these curves similar to the
switch from phase 1 to phase 2 we observed in many countries during
the first wave. For instance, see Figure 15. This resulted in some
passage to phase 2 in the USA, but not in Israel.
The situation is of course very fluid, the levels of new cases are high
in both countries, and there is uncertainty with the beginning of the
Fall there and everywhere. Then the developments were different in
both countries. The USA basically reached phase 2 as of 09/13; many
schools and business were closed. Israel’s curve went up significantly
and eventually this country enforced a total lockdown.
13. Conclusion. The main result of this paper is that the curves of
the total numbers of detected infections of Covid-19 can be described
with high accuracy by our ”two-phase solution”. Let us provide one
more confirmation. It appeared that Figure 24 extended to September
13 matches very well our formula for proper parameters. As for 9/20,
the trend was toward some linear growth of the total number of cases,
but the applicability of our two-phase solution to the second waves of
this epidemic is of course an important argument in favor of the validity
of our approach.
Let us provide some account of the projections for the USA we obtained during several stages:
(1) in contrast to almost all Europe, the initial u–curve presented in
Figure 1 with the saturation ttop at 5/5 did not work for the USA;
(2) the switch to mode (AB) and the corresponding w–curve with
the saturation at 5/30 in Figure 7 did not work too, in contrast to UK;
(3) the projection ”9/19” from Figure 20, based on the fact that ∼22
states reached phase 2 in June, did not materialized as well.
A very good match with our Bessel-type solution for the total number
of detected cases in the USA in the middle of phase 1 of the first wave
was the reason to expect (1) or (2), by analogy with many counties in
Europe and some in Asia. The match was good for quite some time, ...
before the hard measures were significantly relaxed. The projection in
(3) was quite stable, but the next dramatic reduction of hard measures

46

IVAN CHEREDNIK

in almost all 50 states made the saturation at 9/19 unlikely; the number
of states in phase 2 quickly dropped from 22 to 8, and the USA entered
the second wave. It was supposed to be similar to Figure 21 for Europe,
but this did not happen.
With these 3 instances, the ”pattern” is basically the same: hard
measures were relaxed upon the first signs of improvements, well before
sufficiently small numbers of new daily cases were reached. There are
of course serious reasons for such a reduction, and this is applicable
not only to the USA.
We mention that this kind of ”early response” sometimes works well,
for instance with contrarian investing strategies. However, professional
investing is based on the earliest possible access to the news and predicting ”mass behavior”. Here we face something different.
Having the 2nd wave on top of the ”unfinished” first is of course a
negative development. Monitoring new infections, treating those infected, and general control of the situation become significantly less
doable. Obviously, the likelihood of such a pattern exists in quite a
few countries, Brazil and India included.
Clear second waves were present in the middle of July in 15+ countries and now (the middle of September) are quite common in Europe.
It is likely that our differential equations and Bessel-type solutions describe them with the same kind of accuracy, as for the first waves. As
it was predicted, they appeared right after the end of the first ones and
their shape and the strength were quite comparable with those of the
first waves.
Regardless of our theory, this confirms that ”hard measures” were
the main reason for the saturation of Covid-19 in many countries. The
second waves are quite common in epidemics, but they cannot be so
soon if the process is ”natural”, i.e. not under intensive management.
Mathematical understanding the epidemic spread and forecasting the
results of their management obviously deserve a systematic theory. In
this paper, we mostly focus on the uniformity of the spread of Covid19 in many countries, namely, on the uniformity of the curves of total
numbers of detected infections, which appeared very surprising. We
think that our approach explains this.
There are not many different modes of epidemic management and
the ways to ”measure” the epidemic dynamics. Similar management,
if it is the key factor, can be expected to result in similar features of
the epidemic spread, including the curves of total cases, the saturation,
the passage from phase one to phase two, and the second waves.
Every country has of course its own path during Covid-19. There
can be several different patterns here (not just one), so a final theory
will be ramified. The results of our theoretical and numerical analysis
suggest that by now we have the following major ones:

MOMENTUM MANAGING EPIDEMIC SPREAD

47

(a) The West-European pattern, with a successful path to the saturation of both phases and modeled very well by our ”2-phase solution”;
(b) the USA pattern, similar to (a), but with as early reductions of
hard measures as possible, which significantly delays the saturation;
(c) ”Brazil-India”, with high c, replacing R0 in our theory, and with
long stages of strong polynomial growth of the curves of total cases.
Let us update Figure 12 till 10/07/2020. The parameters there were
determined before the turning point, so they were not that reliable. As
of the beginning of November, India presumably reached this point.
Interestingly, only c required some adjustment; it is now c = 5.75 vs
c = 5.2 determined for the period till 8/23. All other coefficients,
including the exponent are unchanged. The same (brown) power function 0.0125(t + 0.07)3.65 provided a good approximation till the turning
point. The match with our Bessel-type solution was almost perfect,
though of course much will depend on the further developments in India. Recall that y =cases/10K in Fig. 25. The red dots are those
used in Figure 12 (till 8/23). The clear polynomiality of the curve of
total cases in India and the match with our u-functions are of course
important confirmations of our theory. We have:
√ 
√
u(t) = 0.55 tc/2+0.5 Jc/2−0.5 ( at)+0.2J0.5−c/2 ( at) , c = 5.75, a = 0.035.

Automated modeling epidemics based on our ”2-phase solution” followed by their automated forecasting is quite a challenge. This seems
doable by analogy with the algorithms described in [Ch1] for trading
stocks, which are working programs. For phase 2, our software can
manage automatically (one-click) any groups of countries. This is not

48

IVAN CHEREDNIK

an AI-type system so far, with self-learning and so on, but already
quite efficient to monitor daily the later stages of Covid-19.
For the ”end-users”, our (or any) projections must be constantly
renewed on the basis of the latest data. However it is very important to
test the forecasts without any later adjustments and during sufficiently
long periods; we do this systematically in this paper. The testing
periods are the black and blue dots in our graphs.
It is of course important that our theory was created in the middle of
the epidemic; this provides almost a unique chance to test it real-time.
Real-time experiments are a must for forecasting and trading systems
in stock markets. No models can be accepted there without such runs
and carefully crafted tests excluding any usage of ”future”. This kind
of discipline is not present in forecasting epidemics.
It is not unusual when the epidemic curves are approximated piecewise using frivolous choices of formulas and parameters. For Covid-19,
the curves for the numbers of total cases can be presented as piecewise polynomial functions with fluctuating exponents, but this only
confirms that their growth is no greater than polynomial.
Our u-curves used for phase 1 depend only on two major parameters,
the initial transmission rate c, which can be seen in the early stages,
and the intensity, a, of the measures employed. If u2 is used, then its
coefficient is the third one, but this is mostly needed to address some
”effects of second order”.
Forecasting epidemics is of course a natural aim, but mathematical
models are sometimes considered ”acceptable” even if they are disconnected with real epidemic data. For instance, the usage of R0 , the
reproduction number, is common in the literature in spite of the fact
that the exponential growth of the number of cases can be observed
only during very short periods, if any. The usage of the statistical tools
and random processes is important, but only after the basic differential
or difference equations are proved to be applicable.
To conclude, any forecasting required and requires mathematics.
Any analysis or discussion of such complex events as epidemics must be
based on strict definitions. For instance, comparing different countries
and various phases is impossible without solid mathematical methods.
This is fully applicable to understanding the efficiency of the measures
employed, which can be a difficult task even if the corresponding mathematical tools are adequate.
Modeling the spread of Covid-19 appeared closely related to the
Bessel functions, which can be a challenge for researches in the field of
mathematical epidemiology. The theory of these functions, introduced
by Daniel Bernoulli and generalized by Bessel, was renewed recently.
We actually use some recent developments, but the final formulas require only very basic ”one-line” definitions, simple to use practically.

Their quasi-periodicity is a deep classical result, which provides a
brand new approach to the saturation of epidemics under active management. In contrast to the saturation due to the herd immunity or
biological factors, this kind of saturation, the main one for Covid-19,
is of unstable nature and does require thorough mathematical theory.
This paper is the first step in this direction.

14. Appendix: auto-forecasting. We will discuss the usage of the
programs designed for forecasting late stages of the waves of Covid19 in any countries or groups of countries. They are available as the
supplement to the published version of this work; see also [Ch2]. The
second wave of Covid-19 in the USA is considered in detail; our 2-phase
solution appeared applicable.
Forecasting late stages. The programs are designed to be used only
at later stages of (the waves of) Covid-19 in any countries, groups of
countries, and regions. We provide a ”universal program” (any countries) in FOREU.zip, and its version in FORUS.zip designed for the
USA via auto-forecasting the spread in all 50 states and calculating
the superposition of the corresponding projections. These programs
are based on the type B formulas for uB (t), which were used in our
2-phase solution. They describe only later stages: phase two in our
terminology.
The ”universal program” gave quite stable results for Western Europe, but only till the middle of August. Then the second wave began
there, presumably due to the end of vacations and the beginning of the
school year. The USA program (all states separately) provided stable
projections for the saturation till the middle of June, the beginning
of the second wave in the USA. Then a significant reduction of the
hard measures began. It appeared applicable again in the beginning
of September in the USA, with a path to the saturation of the second
wave.
The fact that many schools and businesses were closed in the USA,
in contrast to Europe, contributed to this. However the trend changed
in the middle of September: the number of new daily cases became
essentially constant, which corresponds to a linear growth of the number of total cases. In Europe, a strong growth of the total number of
(detected) cases began in the end of August, so the program became
essentially a linear approximation in September.

Two outputs. The ”universal program” starting with about 9/20 gave
the linear approximation for the total number of infections. We provide
the output of 9/23 in Figure 26. The projections are for 3 months from
the date if the saturation cannot be found during this period.
The second program, based on the consideration of all 50 states, is
presumably more reliable. The first run we provide is as of 9/12. The
projection was 5.8M in the first 2 weeks of December on top of the
initial 2.1M at 06/16. Actually, only about 17 States were in phase 2,
so this was not really reliable. This number dropped to about 11 on
9/22. The program still found the saturation for the 9-day average of
the corresponding curves but it was 12/28. The trend was toward the
linear growth of the total number of cases.

Any reopening of schools and businesses in the USA can and will
influence these projections, as occurred in Europe. This already happened in the middle of June, when the USA approached the second
phase of the 1st wave, after the hard measures were significantly reduced. Much depends on the virus evolution too. Let us provide two
outputs of the program for the USA: Figures 27, 28.
Two phase-solution. This solution worked well at least till the middle
of September for the second wave in the USA. The accuracy is comparable with what we obtained and discussed in this paper for the first waves
in Japan, Israel, Italy, Germany, UK and the Netherlands. Upon subtracting 2.1M , the parameters we obtained for the early-middle stage

The second phase matched well the following function:
uB (t) = 4.1 tc/2 cos(d log(M ax(1, t))), c = 2.65, d = 0.435.
The projected saturation for uB was given by the formula tend =
c
exp d1 tan−1 ( 2d
) . Numerically, tend = 17.8463, which is 178 days from
06/16: December 11, 2020. See Figure 29. This date basically matches
the auto-projection based on considering all 50 states separately in
Figures 27, 28. However, the latter are actually the last ones before
the growth of the number of total cases became linear in the USA.

Practical matters. The main programs in F OREU.zip are ”forwor.txt”
and ”forworstat.txt”. In Mathematica, run ”forwor.txt”; it is set for
the United States. Upon making grp = 0 in ”worldfile.txt”, it will
work for Europe. Some countries were excluded in Europe, mostly due
to problems with data. To change this you need to open ”forwor.txt”
and ”forworstat.txt” and find the corresponding places. Mathematica
programs are readable.
Generally, the program is ”one-click”: run the exe-file, after you
adjust the path to ”math.exe” in your computer in the file ”mathpath.txt”, and set the countries/regions in ”worldfile.txt” following the
”README” file.
This is similar for the program for 50 states in the USA. There is
no file ”worldfile.txt”, and currently all states are included. The initial
date is set to 06/16/2020. This can be adjusted directly in ”forusa.txt”
and ”forustat.txt”: change ”datein” (all instances).
The initial date is automatically set to 3 months before ”today” in
the universal program (for any countries), but not in this one. Here it
is the beginning of the wave.

Mathematica 11 is necessary to use these programs. For the universal program, raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/ is
used: the online access to this site is needed. The names of the countries and regions in ”worworld.txt” must be as at this site.
The site raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/ is
used for the program managing the 50 states in the USA.
The saturation in these programs is technical; it is supposed to move
over time. If the program detects no saturation, then the projections
will be provided for a 4 month period; in this case, the program mostly
works as a linear extrapolation.
The programs are not for any commercial use; the name of their
creator, Ivan Cherednik, and a link to the Journal or [Ch2] must be
always provided. This is a research tool only. The source file in Mathematica is readable, so you can understand what the programs really
do. Please see the README-files.
