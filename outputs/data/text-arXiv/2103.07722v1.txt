Abstract
Heparin is administered intravenously as an anticoagulant to COVID-19 patients and via aerosol to treat
other lung diseases. It has recently been found to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 as it hinders
attachment of the virus to the host cell by binding to the virus spike glycoprotein. Here, we describe
molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how heparin binds to the spike and the mechanism by which it
exerts its antiviral activity. The simulations show that heparin polyanionic chains can bind at long, mostly
positively charged patches on the spike, preventing the binding of host cell heparan sulphate proteoglycans
to the spike. Heparin can mask both the S1/S2 basic motif, thereby inhibiting furin cleavage and the
formation of the prefusion conformation, and the basic residues of the receptor binding domain (RBD), thus
acting on the hinge region responsible for the motion of the RBD between inactive closed and active open
conformations of the spike. In simulations of the closed spike, heparin binds the RBD and the N-terminal
domain of two adjacent spike subunits and hinders the opening. In simulations of the open spike, heparin
binds similarly but induces stabilization of the hinge region and a change in RBD motion. Heparin is therefore
able to inhibit host cell attachment directly and by two allosteric mechanisms. Furthermore, the simulations
provide insights into how heparan sulphate proteoglycans on the host cell can facilitate viral infection. Our
results will aid the rational optimization of heparin derivatives for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy.
Significance statement
Heparin is used to prevent thrombosis in COVID-19 patients and administered via aerosol to treat other lung
diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that heparin can hinder SARS-CoV-2 infection by binding to
the virus spike glycoprotein. In the present work, we identified positively charged paths along the spike
surface that connect functional sites where heparin can bind. We computationally docked heparin chains to
the spike and then carried out atomic-detail molecular simulations of heparin-spike complexes that revealed
three mechanisms by which heparin can exert its antiviral effect. The simulations also provide insights into
how host cell heparan sulphate proteoglycans can facilitate viral infection. These results will aid the
development of new heparin derivatives as therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.
Introduction
In the last year, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) has adversely affected the lives of all people around the world. SARS-CoV-2 is a
lipid-enveloped positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the ​Coronaviridae family (1,2,3). Among the
SARS-CoV-2 proteins, the spike S glycoprotein (spike) is highly conserved in the ​Coronaviridae family (76%
and 96% amino acid sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-1 and BatCoV-RaTG13, respectively (1)). It
possesses 22 N-linked glycans that likely contribute to protein stability and immune evasion of the virus (4).

The spike mediates the entry of the virus into human cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) receptor (5). The prefusion spike is exposed on the virion surface as a homotrimer. Each spike
subunit is composed of two domains, S1 and S2, connected by the S1/S2 junction, and involved in virus
attachment and fusion, respectively (5). The S1/S2 junction is a novel feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike that
consists of a multibasic sequence that is cleaved by the host furin protease (1,3,5,6). This cleavage activates
the formation of the post-fusion conformation of spike, which is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host
cells (5,6). Intriguingly, the S1/S2 site is part of a recently identified superantigen motif on the SARS-CoV-2
spike that has been proposed to interact with T-cell receptors and thereby elicit a hyperinflammatory
response (7).
The heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the surface of human host cells are composed of a
core protein that harbours multiple polysulfated glycosaminoglycan chains with a similar structure to heparin
(8). Experimental evidence suggests an essential role for HSPGs as co-receptors that, by binding spike,
favour SARS-CoV-2 attachment to human cells (9,10). Although heparin is currently used to treat COVID-19
patients because of its strong anticoagulant activity (11), it has been shown to have antiviral activity, primarily
in its unfractionated state (with chains consisting of about 70 monosaccharides on average), likely due to its
ability to compete with HSPGs for binding to the spike (9,10,11,12,13).
The binding of spike to heparin or HSPGs is mediated by clusters of positively charged amino acid
residues in the spike (hereafter called heparin binding domains, HBDs), and negatively charged sulfate
groups on the polysaccharide chains of heparin or the HSPGs (8,9,10). To date, three HBDs have been
identified in the spike sequence: in the RBD (RBD-HBD) and at the S2’ site (TMPRSS2 cleavage site (14)),
both of which are present in SARS-CoV-1, and at the novel S1/S2 furin cleavage site (S1/S2-HBD) (10) (Fig.
1A).
While the mechanism underlying HSPG-mediated internalization and the antiviral activity of heparin
are well understood for many HSPG-dependent viruses (15), it has only recently begun to be investigated for
SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, among the various coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 spike is unique in possessing
three different HBDs that overlap with motifs that have with distinct functions (RBD, TMPRSS2 and furin
cleavage sites), indicating that spike-HSPG or spike-heparin interactions may have multifaceted effects on
SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context, we here report the results of a molecular modeling and simulation
study aimed at revealing how heparin can exert its antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2 and how HSPGs can
facilitate virus infection. In particular, we consider the mechanistic consequences of the sequence features
that are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike for the effects of heparin and HSPGs on viral infection and
inflammation. The results of our study provide insights that will guide the design of therapeutic heparin
derivatives and the investigation of the mechanism by which HSPGs act as host-cell co-receptors.
Results and Discussion
• Long mostly basic patches on the spike glycoprotein accommodate heparin
We considered the inactive closed and active open prefusion conformations of the homotrimeric
SARS-CoV-2 spike head, which consists of three subunits: S​A​, S​B and S​C​. In the inactive closed
conformation, the ACE2 receptor binding face on the RBD is not accessible in the three subunits, which we
refer to as down-subunits. In the active open conformation, the ACE2 binding site of the RBD is accessible
only in the S​C subunit, which we refer to as the up-subunit. To investigate the binding of heparin to spike, we
modelled five systems with the spike: (i) in the closed conformation; (ii) in the closed conformation with a
single heparin chain bound; (iii) in the closed conformation with three heparin chains bound; (iv) in the open
conformation; and (v) in the open conformation with three heparin chains bound.
The model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike head (Fig. 1B) was based on the SwissModel model (available
at ​https://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/species/2697049​) to which we covalently attached 18 N-glycans
per subunit (4). To identify continuous positively charged paths on the protein surface at which the long
heparin chains could bind, the electrostatic potential of the spike head protein was computed for both the
closed and open conformations. Analysis of the electrostatic potential suggests that a long polyanionic
heparin chain can follow similar paths on the surfaces of the two conformations of the spike head that differ
only in the interactions with the RBD-HBD (Fig. 1B). We used the incremental docking and sliding window
method (16) to model complexes of the spike head with heparin chains of 31 monosaccharides (31mer). The
docked heparin chains run along mostly basic patches, passing partially through surface grooves, from the
S1/S2 basic motif (R682, R683, R685), via the channel between the N-terminal domain of the same spike

subunit and the RBD-HBD of an adjacent spike subunit (R346, R355, K356, R357) to the tip of the spike
head.
Due to the structural similarity between heparin and the polysaccharide chains of HSPGs, it is
expected that the latter also bind along the basic paths identified on the trimeric spike head. By burying these
basic regions, heparin can be expected to hinder the binding of HSPGs, reducing the amount of
SARS-CoV-2 that can tether to the cell surface, thus decreasing the binding to the ACE2 receptor and hence
infection. This model provides a mechanistic explanation for the experimental data demonstrating that
heparin can diminish SARS-CoV-2 infection (8,13).

SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein head (residues 1-1140), which is composed of S1 and S2 subunits. The

chains that span from the S1/S2 site HBD to the RBD-HBD are shown in stick representation, coloured by

• Heparin stabilises the spike glycoprotein in the closed conformation
The five modelled systems were each simulated in aqueous solution in multiple 1​µ​s all-atom
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Representative structures obtained after clustering analysis of the
spike in closed and open conformations with 3 heparin chains bound show that the heparin chains maintain
their alignment along the long positively charged surface patches on the spike during the simulations (Fig.
2A). The spike structures reached convergence within ~2-400 ns in all simulations, as shown by the root
mean square deviation (RMSD) relative to each starting structure (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1). Moreover, when in
complex with heparin, the spike showed an approximately 1 Å lower RMSD, indicating that the binding to
heparin stabilized the homotrimer structure (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1). Further evidence of the structural
stabilization was provided by the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF), which tended to lower values for the
RBD, the hinge region associated with the opening of the RBD (see next section for further details), and the
S1/S2 site when bound to heparin (Fig. S2, Tab. S1-S3). Accordingly, the RMSD of heparin indicates an
induced fit along the trajectory (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1). The complementarity of the interactions and the change
in width of the basic groove in both the closed and open spike bound to heparin suggest an induced fitting
upon binding that results in the well-defined partially grooved basic path where heparin lies (Fig. 2A).
Overall, the H-bond and Interaction fingerprint analysis (17) of all the MD simulations show that each
heparin chain maintains stable interactions with two adjacent spike subunits in both the closed and open
conformations of spike (Fig. 2A, Fig. S3, Tab. S4-S6). Heparin binds through H-bonding interactions (with
over 90% occupancy throughout all the MD trajectories) to the basic residues of the S1/S2-HBD in the first
subunit and of the RBD-HBD of the second subunit of both the open and closed spike conformations.
However, along the heparin path, additional, less specific binding regions, which differ between the open and
the closed conformations, were identified in over 75% of the MD frames and these can further stabilize the
complexes.
In the closed spike model, the binding of either one or three heparin chains hinders the opening of
spike by stabilizing the closed conformation through the simultaneous binding of the RBD of one subunit
(residues T345, R346, N354, R355, S359, N360, N450) and the N-terminal domain of the adjacent subunit
(residues N165, C166, T167, E169, V171, Q173, F220, N280, N282, T284, T286) (Fig. 2A, Fig.S3, Tab. S4
and Tab. S6). In the closed conformation of spike, the RBDs are essentially strapped into the
down-orientation by heparin which prevents spike activation to the open conformation. Finally, heparin
binding is also stabilised by hydrogen-bond interactions adjacent to the multibasic S1/S2 site (residues
N606, S686, S689, S690) (Fig.S3, Tab.S1 and Tab.S3).
The simulations of spike in the open state do not show any tendency for heparin to induce closure of
the spike. However, through the simultaneous binding to the up-RBD of subunit S​C (residues T345, R346,
N354, R355, R357, N360) and the N-terminal domain of the adjacent subunit (residues R34, T167, E169,
Q173, L176, R-90, H207, T208, F220, S221), heparin induces a change in the orientation of the RBD in the
up-subunit during the simulations (Fig 2A, Fig. S3, Tab. S5-S6 and next section for further details). As for the
closed models, some polar residues near to the multibasic S1/S2 site (N606, Y674, S686, Q689, S690)
permanently interact with the heparin chain in the open state.
Notably, the simulations of both open and closed spike with heparin bound suggest an aspecific
modulatory effect of N-glycans on the binding between spike and heparin, see Figure S4.

• Heparin masks the S1/S2 furin cleavage site
To assess the role of the novel S1/S2 furin cleavage site, which has been identified as a novel
putative HBD (6) and as part of a superantigenic sequence (7) in the spike of SARS-CoV-2, H-bond
formation to the site was monitored along the trajectories and surface exposure of the S1/S2 site to the
solvent was analysed for representative structures after clustering (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5, Tab. S4-S7). In the
initial modelled complexes, the first monosaccharides of the heparin chain interact with the basic residues of
the S1/S2-HBD. Salt-links with R682, R683 and R685 are maintained along all the trajectories (>90%
occupancy), indicating strong interactions of the S1/S2-HBD with heparin (Fig. 3A, Tab. S4-S6). The
calculated solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of this multibasic site shows the persistence of the
interactions along the simulations of the closed spike bound to heparin (Fig. 3B and Fig. S5). Heparin
approximately halves the surface exposed in the closed models by binding directly to the S1/S2-HBD and the
three heparin chains simultaneously mask all three multibasic sites on the closed spike trimer. In the open
conformation, the reduced SASA in the presence of heparin indicates a significant shielding effect, primarily
at the S1/S2-HBD of the up-subunit, but with the heparin chains also maintaining a lower shielding level at
the S1/S2 HBDs of the down-subunits. This difference could be due to a more favourable arrangement of the
basic patches for heparin binding between the up- and down-subunits compared to that between two
down-subunits.
To assess the shielding effect of heparin relative to that of spike glycosylation, the SASA of the
S1/S2-HBD calculated for the representative clusters was decomposed into the area exposed without
consideration of the N-glycan and heparin sugars, the area exposed accounting for the N-glycans, and the
area exposed accounting for both the N-glycans and heparin (Fig. 3C and Tab. S7). In agreement with the
previous analysis, these calculations indicate that heparin directly binds to the S1/S2-HBDs, halving the
exposed surfaces in both the closed and open conformations. Again, for the open conformation, the shielding
effect exerted by heparin on the S1/S2-HBDs of the two down-subunits is lower than for the same site of the
up-subunit. Moreover, the decomposition shows that the N-glycans of spike make little contribution to the
shielding of the multibasic sites.
In summary, when comparing the binding of one or three heparin chains to the spike homotrimer, all
the data point to the ability of heparin to occupy and shield the S1/S2 site without a significant shielding
contribution of the spike N-glycans. Based on these findings, we propose a triple role for the S1/S2 domain in
spike activity. It acts as the furin cleavage site for the activation of the fusion conformation of spike (6) and is
part of an antigenic sequence proposed to trigger the activation of the T-cells (7). In addition, our simulations
demonstrate a key role in the binding of heparin and indicate its involvement in binding to HSPGs. The
surface area analysis shows that the S1/S2-HBD is exposed to the solvent and available to interact with
heparin or HSPGs, supporting the hypothesis that this novel HBD may contribute to the increased affinity of
SARS-CoV-2 spike for heparin and HSPGs compared to previous coronavirus strains. Finally, we observed
that, in the closed spike model, a single heparin chain occupies the S1/S2-HBD of only one subunit. This
suggests that, to exert its full antiviral activity, heparin needs to be administered at doses high enough to
saturate all three HBDs of the spike trimer, otherwise some of them will still be available for tethering to the
HSPGs on the host cell surface.

• Heparin allosterically affects the hinge region of the RBD and directly interacts with the basic
residues of the RBD-HBD
To assess the effect of heparin binding on the RBD, we analysed the stability of the hinge region
associated with the activation of the RBD, the exposure of the up-RBD (on subunit S​C​) along the trajectory
and the shielding by heparin of the residues of the RBD involved in the interaction with ACE2, hereafter
referred to as the receptor binding motif (RBm) (18).
From a comparison between the crystal structures of the spike in closed and open conformations
and the RMSFs in our simulations (data not shown), we identified residues 527-PKK-529 as the hinge region
responsible for the conformational change that induces the opening of the spike protein. Importantly, no
direct interactions were observed to occur between these residues and heparin (Tab. S4-S6), prompting us
to investigate possible allosteric effects induced in this region by the binding of heparin to spike. For this

purpose, we calculated the RMSD of the hinge region of each subunit along the trajectory and performed
dihedral principal component analysis (dPCA) for this region. As shown in Fig. 4A and Fig. S6, the complex
formed by the closed spike with three heparins bound shows structural stability of the three hinge regions
along all the simulations. The closed conformation with one heparin bound shows stabilization of the two
subunits that are directly involved in the interaction with heparin. However, the S​C subunit, which does not
directly interact with heparin, shows a higher RMSD (Fig. 4A and Fig. S6) and a higher RMSF (Fig. S2, Tab.
S2), suggesting a compensatory effect due to the movement of the hinge region to maintain the closed
conformation. In agreement, dPCA of the hinge region of the closed-S​C subunit in the complex with three
heparins bound shows a limited sampling of the conformational space, in line with the stability in the RMSD
plots. On the other hand, in the complex of the closed conformation with one heparin bound, dPCA shows an
increased sampling for the hinge region, further supporting the hypothesis of a compensatory effect to
maintain the closed conformation (Fig. 4B and Fig. S7). For the open spike with three heparin chains bound,
the RMSD for the hinge region shows stability for the subunits S​A and S​B ​with the down-RBD and an
increased deviation for the up-RBD of subunit S​C compared to the starting structure (Fig. 4A and Fig. S6).
Accordingly, dPCA analysis shows a decrease in sampling of the conformational space of the S​C in the
presence of heparin associated with the stabilization of the hinge region (Fig. 4B and Fig. S7).
To evaluate if the induced fit promoted by heparin causes the masking of the ACE2 binding residues
in the RBm, we calculated the SASA of these residues along the trajectory and their accessibility in the
cluster representatives. Both the analyses show ​that the heparin chains do not significantly shield the
residues of the RBm (Fig. 4C-D, Fig. S8 and Tab. S8). On one hand, these data suggest that the heparin
chains act indirectly on these domains through an induced fit mechanism as described above. On the other
hand, these data are consistent with the ability of spike to simultaneously bind HSPGs and ACE2 on the host
cell surface (7).
Finally, to obtain further insights into the effect of heparin on the open RBD, we performed essential
dynamics (ED) analysis (Fig. 4E and Fig. S9). The analysis on the closed conformation shows an overall
stabilization of the spike by heparin without significant effects on the RBDs (data not shown). ED analysis on
the open spike conformation highlights a different direction of the motion of the RBm loop (residues 472-489)
in the up-subunit described by the first eigenvector during the simulations in the absence and presence of
heparin (Fig. S9). Despite different starting conformations and independent sampling, the up-subunits
consistently show this difference across the replica simulations. These differences suggest that the presence
of hepari​n (or HSPGs) could affect the motion of the RBD, possibly having a gating effect on receptor
binding.

Conclusions
Experiments have shown that HSPGs are indispensable for SARS-CoV-2 infection (9), and that
heparin competes with host cell HSPGs for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, exerting an
antiviral effect (9,10,12,13). Importantly, it has been demonstrated that unfractionated heparin (15-20kDa,
≃​60-80 monosaccharides) has a 150-fold higher antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 than low molecular
weight heparin (4-6kDa, ≃15-25 monosaccharides) (12). Until now, molecular models to investigate the
binding of heparin or HSPGs to spike have been limited to models of short heparin chains (≃6-8
monosaccharides) binding to the basic domain of the spike RBD (9,10,13). However, to understand the
antiviral effect of unfractionated heparin and the role of HSPGs, it is necessary to model the binding of long
polyanionic chains to the spike head. This is a challenging task due to the length, variable sulfation pattern
and flexibility of the polysulfated glycosaminoglycan chains, and because of the large size and flexibility of
the spike head for which some regions and N-glycans are structurally poorly defined (4,5). Therefore,
considering all available experimental data to build high-quality initial models, we first employed our
incremental docking and sliding window method (16) for docking 31mer heparin chains to models of the
spike head glycoprotein. We then performed multiple microsecond MD simulations to refine the models of
the spike head with zero, one or three heparin chains bound to study the dynamic effects of heparin binding.
Despite a total simulation length of over 20 microseconds, the sampling of the configurational space of the
spike-heparin systems was inevitably incomplete. Nevertheless, these simulations allowed us to explore the
main dynamic features associated with the predicted heparin binding modes and thus, to identify
mechanisms by which long heparin chains exert their antiviral activity and HSPGs can act as co-receptors.
We identified three key mechanisms by which heparin exerts its antiviral activity (see Figure 6): (i)
heparin directly competes with HSPGs for the same binding sites on the spike head, burying the same basic
surface regions and hindering the binding to HSPGs of both the closed and open conformations of the spike
head; (ii) heparin masks the S1/S2 multibasic site (unique to SARS-CoV-2), possibly preventing the cleavage
by furin and the activation of the prefusion conformation of the spike, as well as the triggering of the
hyperinflammatory response due to the binding to T-cell receptors of this superantigenic site (7); (iii) heparin
masks the basic residues of the RBD and allosterically acts on the hinge region that is suggested to be key
for the opening of the spike and movement of the RBD to expose the ACE2 receptor binding face. Overall,
we note that both the direct and the allosteric mechanisms require long heparin chains.
Based on our MD simulations with heparin and on the structural similarity between heparin and the
heparan sulfate chains of ​HSPGs, we can infer that: (i) HSPGs ​bind along the same paths on the surface of
spike occupied by heparin; (ii) HSPGs do not directly induce the activation of the closed spike, suggesting
that their role in viral infection may be solely to increase the concentration of the virus on the host-cell
surface. However, HSPGs may also mediate the activation of the closed spike by exposing it to the human
ACE2 receptor on the host cell. HSPGs may also favour the formation of a ternary complex (9) with the open
spike and the ACE2 receptor by binding the basic residues of the RBD of the up-subunit while not masking
the RBm. Notably, both the open and closed spike models with heparin bound suggest a modulatory effect of
N-glycans on the binding between spike and heparin or HSPGs. Finally, emerging SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein variants have demonstrated increased infectivity that could in part be due to mutations near to
the basic domains mentioned above that increase binding to HSPGs.
In conclusion, our models and simulations suggest one direct and two allosteric mechanisms for the
antiviral activity of heparin against SARS-CoV-2 and provide insights into how HSPGs can facilitate viral
infection. They thus provide a basis for the rational optimization of therapeutic heparin derivatives against
SARS-CoV-2.

Fig. 6. Schematic diagram showing the mechanisms by which heparin and HSPGs affect SARS-CoV-2
infection of a host cell.​ Heparin exerts antiviral activity by hindering the binding of both closed and open
conformations of spike to HSPGs. Heparin binds the S1/S2-HBD of spike in both the conformations (1),
hinders the opening/activation of the closed spike (2), and acts allosterically on the hinge region associated
with the movement of the RBD, while directly masking the RBD-HBD (3). Moreover, based on the structural
similarity between heparin and HSPGs, we expect that HSPGs are able to bind both the closed (4) and open
(5) conformations of spike, and, in the presence of the ACE2 receptor, favouring the activation of the closed
spike and its interaction with the ACE2 receptor (4), and subsequent furin cleavage and SARS-CoV-2
infection. However, we cannot exclude a possible ACE2-independent SARS-CoV-2 internalization mediated
by HSPGs binding to the closed spike conformation.
Methods
Modelling of the systems. The initial models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike head protein in closed and open
conformations
were
taken
from
the
SwissModel
website
(​https://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/species/2697049​) and were based on two structures determined
by cryo-electron microscopy: PDBid 6ACC (seq. identity 76.47%) and PDBid: 6ACD (seq. identity 76.47%),
respectively (19). The spike models were completed by adding 18 N-glycans per subunit, covalently attached

in accordance with the experimentally determined glycomic profile (4), using the Glycam web
(​http://glycam.org/) (20). Standard protonation states were used. The APBS electrostatics plugin in Pymol
(21) was used to compute the electrostatic potential surface calculated with PDB2PQR (22) at neutral pH
using PROPKA (23) and ff14SB force (24). 31mer heparin chains spanning from the S1/S2 multibasic site to
the RBD-HBD were modelled using the incremental docking and sliding window method developed by
Bugatti and co-workers (16) using Autodock 4.2 (25). Five model systems were generated: the closed spike
with zero, 1 or 3 heparin chains, and the open spike with zero or 3 heparin chains.
All-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation​. The Amber20 package (26) was used to energy minimize,
equilibrate, and generate production trajectories for each model system. Four replica all-atom MD
production simulations of 1​ µs duration ​in explicit solvent were run for each system.
Analysis of MD simulations. MD trajectories were analysed using CPPTRAJ from AmberTools20 (26) and
Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) (27).
Details of the simulation and analysis protocols are given in Supplementary Methods.

1. Supplementary Methods
All-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation​. The Amber20 package (1) was used to carry out
the simulations. Parameters for the spike were assigned with the ff14SB (2) and GLYCAM-06j (3)
force fields. Heparin was parameterized following the method published by Bugatti et al. (4). All the
glycoprotein models were placed in a periodic cubic water box using the TIP3P water model (5) with
10 Å between the solutes and the edges of the box. Na+ and Cl- ions were added to neutralize the
systems and to immerse them in solvent with an ionic strength of 150mM.
Each system was energy minimized in 14 consecutive minimisation steps, each of 100 steps
of steepest descent followed by 900 steps of conjugate gradient, with decreasing positional restraints
from 1000 to 0 kcal/mol A​2 on all the atoms of the systems excluding waters, counterions and
hydrogens, with a cut-off for non-bonded interactions of 8 Å. The systems were then subjected to two
consecutive steps of heating, each of 100000 steps, from 10 to 100 K and from 100 to 310 K in an
NVT ensemble with a Langevin thermostat. Bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained with
the SHAKE algorithm (6) and 2 fs time step was used. The systems were then equilibrated at 310 K in
4 consecutive steps of 2.5 ns each in the NPT ensemble with a Langevin thermostat with random
velocities assigned at the beginning of each step. For each system simulated, 4 independent replica
production runs following the same protocol as for the equilibration, were carried out starting from
restart files chosen randomly from the last 5ns of equilibration. During the MD simulations, a cutoff of
8 Å for the evaluation of short-range non-bonded interactions was used and the Particle Mesh Ewald
method was employed for the long-range electrostatic interactions. The temperature was kept
constant at 310 K with a Langevin thermostat. Coordinates were written at intervals of 100 ps.
Production simulations were carried out on the Marconi100 accelerated cluster
(https://www.hpc.cineca.it/hardware/marconi100) which is based on the ​IBM Power9 AC922 CPU
architecture with each accelerator having four Volta V100 NVIDIA GPUs​. ​Each simulation was carried
out on a single GPU.
Analysis of MD simulations. MD trajectories were analysed using CPPTRAJ from AmberTools20 (1)
and molecular graphics analysis was performed using Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) (7).
- Cluster analysis ​of the structures was carried out using CPPTRAJ (1) for the last 100 ns of all the
trajectories considering backbone C-alpha atoms for the protein residues and all the carbon, oxygen,
sulfate and nitrogen atoms for the heparin chains. N-glycans were excluded from the analysis. The
hierarchical agglomerative (bottom-up) approach was used with a minimum distance between the
clusters of 3.0​Å and the distance between clusters defined by the average distance between
members of two clusters (Fig. 2A).
- Hydrogen bond (H-bond) analysis ​was performed using CPPTRAJ (1) along all the trajectories for
frames at intervals of 10ns (coordinated collected every 100 ps collected with a stride of 100 frames)
and setting 3.5 Å as the upper distance for defining a H-bond between heavy atoms. All the atoms
including the hydrogens of the systems were considered (Fig. 2A, Fig.S3, Tab.S1 and S2).
- Interaction fingerprint analysis (IFP) was performed using the MD-IFP python scripts (8)
(​https://github.com/HITS-MCM/MD-IFP)​. The interactions between the spike and the heparin chains
were computed along all the trajectories for frames at intervals of 10ns (coordinated collected every
100 ps collected with a stride of 100 frames) (Tab.S3, IFP-model02, IFP-model03, IFP-model05).
- ​Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) were calculated using CPPTRAJ (1) for all C-alpha atoms of
the individual spike subunits - S​A​, S​B​, S​C - and for all the carbon, oxygen, sulfate and nitrogen atoms
of the heparin chains (Fig.S2).
- Root mean square deviations (RMSD) were calculated using CPPTRAJ (1) for all C-alpha atoms of
the individual spike subunits - S​A​, S​B​, S​C - and for all the carbon, oxygen, sulfate and nitrogen atoms
of the heparin chains (Fig. 2B and Fig.S1). The RMSDs of the hinge regions were calculated for the
C-alpha atoms of residues 527-529 for S​A​, S​B​, and S​C​ separately (Fig. 4A and Fig.S5).
- Solvent Accessible surface area (SASA)​. Two separate SASA analyses were carried out for the S​A
S​B and S​C subunits
separately:
along the trajectory using CPPTRAJ (1) and on the most
​

representative clusters using NACCESS (9). In both the analyses, the van der Waals radius of the
solvent probe was assigned a value of 1.4 Å. For the analysis of the S1/S2 site, residues 682-685
were considered (Fig.3B-C, Fig.S4, Tab.S4). In the case of the receptor binding residues, all the
residues of the RBD (residues 330-530) were considered along the trajectory and only the RBm
residues (K417, G446, Y449, Y453, L455, F456, A475, F486, N487, Y489, Q493, G496, Q498, T500,
N501, G502, Y505) suggested by Lan and co-workers (10) for the representative clusters (Fig.4C-D,
Fig.S7 and Tab.S5).
- ​Dihedral Principal Component Analysis (dPCA) was performed using CPPTRAJ (1). The dihedral
covariance matrix and the projection were calculated for the backbone phi/psi angles of residues
527-529 of the S​C monomer. The first four eigenvectors and eigenvalues were extracted and the first
two principal components were plotted for all the systems. All the systems were transformed into the
same principal component space to evaluate the variance across the replicas (Fig. 4B and Fig.S6).
- Essential Dynamics (ED) analysis was performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the
unbiased MD simulations. PCA was performed along all the trajectories individually with CPPTRAJ
(1). The principal modes of motion were visualized using VMD. The first normalized eigenvectors for
model04 and model05 were plotted along the trajectory and the direction of motion was defined by
visual inspection (Fig. 4E and Fig.S8).

of the five simulated systems. The RMSD values for the individual subunits - S​A, S​B and S​C - were
calculated for the C-alpha atoms of residues 51-1063 and are shown in blue, pink and magenta,
respectively. The RMSD values of the three heparin chains were calculated for all the C, N and O
atoms in all monosaccharides and are colored green, light green and turquoise.

for the individual subunits - S​A, S​B and S​C - were calculated for the C-alpha atoms of residues 1-3697
and are shown in blue, pink and magenta, respectively. The red boxes represent the RBD (residues
330-530) for each subunit, the black arrows highlight the hinge regions (residue 527-529) and the
green arrows point to the S1/S2 residues (residues 682-685). For both the boxes and the arrows, the
dashed and continuous lines represent the regions not interacting and interacting with heparin,
respectively.

bound showed the ​H-bond interactions of heparin with spike subunits S​B and S​C as in close-ups of the
side views in Figure. 1. The labelled residues shown in sticks and colored as the subunits were
involved in H-bond interactions with heparin for more than half of the simulations of the spike in the
closed (with 1 and 3 heparin chains) or open states. The S​A, S​
are colored white,
​ B and S​C subunits
​
pink and magenta, respectively, and are shown in cartoon representation with the covalently attached
N-glycans in line representation. Heparin is shown as a surface coloured by elements in green, red,
yellow and blue for carbons, oxygens, sulphates and nitrogens, respectively.

Fig.S4 N
​ -glycans can modulate binding of the spike to heparin by transiently displacing heparin from
the spike surface. The heparin chains in both closed and open models of spike were modelled to
interact with the K444 and N448 residues, that are in close proximity to the ACE2 binding residues.
Visual inspection of the trajectories and the H-bond analysis showed that N-glycans can aspecifically
and transiently cause the detachment of a limited portion of the heparin chains from the spike. We
identified two N-glycans with key roles in this mechanism: the N-glycan attached to N-122 (in the
N-terminal domain) acts only in the closed conformation whereas the N-glycan attached to N-343 (in
the RBD) is mainly responsible for detachment in both the closed and the open conformations. The
figure shows the interactions between the N-122 (left) and N-343 (right) N-glycans with heparin in
closed and open models, respectively. The region shown in the spike is indicated by the squares in
the insets. The S​B and S​C subunits are shown as translucent surfaces and cartoons in pink and
magenta, respectively. N-122, N-343 and the N-glycans are shown in stick representation and colored
by element with pink/magenta carbons. Heparin chains are shown in stick representation with carbons
in light green (left) and cyan (right). Dashed lines indicate the H-bond interactions between the
glycans and heparin.As ​SPR and circular dichroism spectroscopy experiments were done using
unfractionated heparins (13.5-15kDa - ​~4
​ 8 monosaccharides), we cannot exclude that longer heparin
chains could maintain the interaction with these residues (11). Our simulations suggest that N-glycans
may exert a shielding effect that results in a non-specific, partial and transient detachment of heparin
from the spike.

replica MD trajectories of the five simulated systems. The SASA of the S1/S2 site (residues 682-685)
in each spike subunit - S​A, S​B and S​C - is shown in blue, pink and magenta, respectively, and was
computed using CPPTRAJ (1).

respectively.

the RBD-hinge region (residues 527-529) of the S​C subunit for the four replica MD trajectories of the
five simulated systems. PC1 and PC2 are plotted on the x and y axes, respectively. Note that the
second replica of model 02 differs from the others because of the interaction between heparin and the
N-glycan at N122 and the fourth replica of model 05 differs from the others for this system because of
the interaction between heparin and the N-glycan at N343 in this trajectory.

motion of the first eigenvector on the RBD of the S​C subunit which can be seen to differ between
Model04 and Model05. Note that the direction for the fourth replica of Model05 differs from the other
replicas because of the interaction between heparin and the N-glycan at N343 in this trajectory.

Tab.S4 Analysis of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between the spike and the heparin chains in Model03
for the four replica MD trajectories using CPPTRAJ (1). Each heparin chain interacts with two
adjacent subunits, S​A​-S​B​, S​B​-S​C or S​C​-S​A​, and the spike residues involved in the interaction are listed
separately as residues of the first subunit and of the second subunit. The yellow boxes represent the
H-bonds that were stable in more than half the simulations with an occupancy > 50% in the single
trajectory considering the 3 heparin chains on each subunit. The H-bonds for Model02 (data not
shown) are not reported because they are very similar to these results.

Tab.S6 Interaction Fingerprint Analysis (MD-IFP) (8) between heparin and spike residues. In
Model02, one heparin chain interacts with residues of S​A and S​B subunits. In Models 03 and 05, each
of the three heparin chains interacts with residues of S​A​-S​B or
S​B​-S​C or S​C​-S​A​. Histograms show the
​
interaction in the first 10 frames, last 10 frames and in all the frames in blue, orange and with lines,
respectively. Blue and red boxes include the NTD-RBD and S1/S2 domains, respectively. To read the
residue name and number, see the attached files IFP-model02, IFP-model03 and IFP-model04.
These files report the Amber numbering as follows. subunit S​A residues 2-1124, subunit SB residues
1289-2411, subunit SC residue number 2574-3696 (fasta numbering for all the subunits; residues
13-1139).
