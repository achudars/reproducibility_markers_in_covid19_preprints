Figure 1. The cartoons depict an example of a transportation network we investigate in this paper. People use four different modes of
transportation: private cars (green), taxis (yellow), railway, and walking. On the right, people avoid using public transportation modes
(railway in this case) due to the effects of pandemic. In addition to more people having to walk, more private cars and taxis operate in the
network, which increases traffic congestion and travel delays for everyone.

Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected many aspects
of people’s daily lives. While many countries are in a reopening stage, some effects of the pandemic on people’s
behaviors are expected to last much longer, including how
they choose between different transport options. Experts
predict considerably delayed recovery of the public transport options, as people try to avoid crowded places. In turn,
significant increases in traffic congestion are expected, since
people are likely to prefer using their own vehicles or taxis

railway. In this paper, we propose to use financial incentives
to set the tradeoff between risk of infection and congestion
to achieve safe and efficient transportation networks. To this
end, we formulate a network optimization problem to optimize taxi fares. For our framework to be useful in various
cities and times of the day without much designer effort, we
also propose a data-driven approach to learn human preferences about transport options, which is then used in our taxi
fare optimization. Our user studies and simulation experiments show our framework is able to minimize congestion
and risk of infection.

Introduction

As months go by, most of the world is still experiencing
difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With many
governments pushing towards re-opening, experts predict
more severe traffic congestion than before the pandemic [8],
especially in urban cities that rely much on public transportation [21]. For example, studies suggest that in San Francisco,
commuters will experience an additional round-trip delay
of 20–80 minutes per person, at a societal cost of 556,000 –
2,736,000 added traffic hours per day [22].
One of the main reasons for expecting such a dramatic
increase in traffic congestion is because the inhabitants of
large metropolitan areas remain reluctant to use public transport [19], and transportation engineers predict a similar
trend to continue for a long period of time [14, 36]. In fact,
large-scale user surveys that aggregate responses from different countries show, for both business and private trips, risk
of infection has become the primary deciding factor on people’s choice of the mode of transportation, becoming more
important than time to destination, price of trip, avoidance
of congestion, convenience, space, and privacy as compared
to pre-pandemic conditions [18]. Accordingly, the use of
public transportation has substantially declined [43]. While
there has also been a drastic decrease in the use of private
vehicles due to lockdowns, the decline has been much more
drastic for public transportation [19], and mobility data show
the recovery with re-opening takes much longer for public
transportation [35]. A similar shift away from ride-hailing
services [44] and taxis [50] is also expected, adding more
challenges to post-pandemic traffic congestion.
While “work from home" practices that have become more
common during the pandemic help decrease the congestion
for now [23], many metropolitan cities have started to take
other precautions to avoid significant increases in traffic
congestion as well as to mitigate the risk of infection. For
example, London and Paris have embarked on plans to create
more biking and walking lanes and routes [20], whereas Istanbul implemented a model of alternate working hours for
public servants and schools [37]. While different solutions
may be applicable based on cultural factors or geographical
conditions, researchers and experts emphasize financial incentives may play an important role for the recovery of public transportation and ride-hailing services [42]. To achieve
this, we need to address the challenge of modeling how human preferences have evolved through the pandemic, and
how these new preferences should affect routing and pricing
public transportation and ride-hailing services.

Beliaev et al.

Our insight in this paper is that we can leverage data-driven
techniques to learn how humans’ choices of mode of transportation have changed due to the pandemic, which we can use to
optimize transportation networks in order to mitigate infection
risk and decrease delays due to congestion. By modeling the
network with four modes of transportation, namely private
cars, taxis (or vehicles of ride-hailing services), railway, and
pedestrians, we optimize the taxi fares based on total demand and other network properties for a social objective
consisting of two factors: safety and efficiency. The users of
the network choose their mode of transportation and the
routes selfishly, i.e., they choose the route that will minimize
their own latency, monetary cost and risk of infection.
Our model can be seen as an indirect Stackelberg game [28,
41], where our planner first indirectly influences the demand
for cars, taxis and railway by deciding the taxi fares. Then the
humans respond selfishly by taking the highest-utility route
available to them, where they might be optimizing based on
their own priorities for latency, monetary cost, and risk of
infection. Such a control scheme using financial incentives
has previously been shown effective for mixed-autonomy
traffic where regular and autonomous vehicles co-exist [5].
In order for our planning module to take into account
people’s preferences about the mode of transportation, we
learn how people tradeoff latency, price and risk of infection
using preference-based learning. We adopt active learning
techniques to improve data-efficiency, as the human is inthe-loop. Our user study results demonstrate that people
care more about the risk of infection while choosing their
transport post-pandemic. In addition, our results on a simulated traffic network shows our network optimization can
be utilized to set the tradeoff between congestion and the
risk of infection.
Our contributions in this work are three-fold:
• We study different modes of transportation in traffic networks by modeling their latencies and risks of infection.
• We leverage active preference-based learning techniques
to learn humans’ preferences about the transport options while taking latency, monetary cost and the risk of
infection into account.
• We formulate an optimization to set the taxi fares in the
network, which uses the learned human preferences, to
minimize traffic congestion and the risk of infection.

Related Work

We now overview the works that study modeling traffic under pandemic, routing games and pricing in transportation.
Traffic under Pandemic. Several works investigated the
impact of the pandemic on transportation networks. Wang
et al. [45] analyzed the Multiscale Dynamic Human Mobility
Flow Dataset [25] and Google Trends to investigate the correlation between the change of mobility patterns, government
policies, and people’s awareness in the United States. Cui

Routing for Transportation in the Face of the COVID-19 Pandemic

et al. [11] proposed a traffic performance score to measure
the impact of the pandemic on urban mobility. Tirachini and
Cats [43] pointed out the problems regarding public transportation due to the pandemic, and urged authorities for
further research in order to sustain the benefits of public
transportation. More related to our work, Hu et al. [21] and
Zheng et al. [50] showed the pandemic caused a change in
the preferred transportation modes and the decline in the use
of public transport may lead to worse traffic congestion than
before. While all of these works are important to understand
the scale of the problem and motivate our work, they do not
propose a solution for achieving safe and efficient mobility
under the pandemic.
Routing Games. Previous works in traffic optimization
have formulated the routing problem as a game between
drivers. Krichene et al. [28] developed an algorithm for efficiently finding Nash equilibria, where drivers have no incentive to unilaterally deviate from their route choice, in parallel
traffic networks under a single mode of transportation. Prior
to that, Roughgarden and Tardos [38] and Correa et al. [9]
had formalized how bad the Nash equilibrium can be in a
routing game. In this paper, we focus on a setting where
owners of private cars reach a Nash equilibrium, whereas
the routing of taxis are indirectly controlled by a social planner through pricing. This is similar to the altruistic Nash
equilibrium proposed by Bıyık et al. [4], except we do not
make altruism assumptions, but use financial incentives to
attain the benefits of altruism. Lazar et al. [31] used reinforcement learning to solve Stackelberg routing games with
mixed-autonomy where the planner had full control over the
autonomous vehicles. Most relatedly, Bıyık et al. [5] considered a similar setup in parallel networks where some portion
of the traffic flow is indirectly controlled through pricing
and the rest choose their routes selfishly. In this work, we
extend the model to include public transportation (trains
in particular) and incorporate safety measures due to the
impacts of the pandemic, creating a more complex social
objective.
Pricing in Transportation Networks. Our work is also
related to the research in tolling [1], as we use financial incentives to enhance safety and efficiency. Specifically, Fleischer et al. [15] and Brown and Marden [7] studied tolling
while taking the users’ various preferences into account.
Sandholm [40] derived tolls to have drivers choose socially
optimal strategies. In the framework we consider in this
work, train fares are constant and the pricing scheme is only
for taxis that take various routes, rather than tolling.
Learning Humans’ Routing Preferences. Finally, our work
leverages preference-based learning which enable learning
humans’ preferences in the absence of user demonstrations
[24, 39, 49]. In preference-based learning, the user is queried
with a set of options from which they are asked to select the

ICCPS ’21, May 19–21, 2021, Nashville, TN, USA

option they most like. While Bıyık et al. [5] used preferencebased learning with the volume removal objective to actively
generate the queries, we adopt the information gain objective [6], which has been shown to be more data-efficient and
user-friendly in terms of the easiness of queries.

Transportation Network Model

We begin by presenting the framework we use to model
the traffic network we consider in this paper, as well as the
monetary cost and risk of infection associated with each
transportation mode. Our traffic network has one origindestination (O-D) pair and multiple parallel roads that connect them. Roads are shared between private cars and taxis.
Additionally, a railroad and pedestrian walking path connect
the origin and destination.1 This is visualized in Fig. 1.
Our goal is to optimize the taxi fares, which depend on the
route taken, to influence the state of the traffic to decrease
latency and risk of infection. While optimizing taxi fares, our
framework will also estimate the latency and risk of infection
associated with each transport option. These estimations are
then revealed to the commuters so that they can take these
factors into account while choosing their transport option.
In addition to the mode of transportation, people also choose
their routes, i.e. they do not only choose to take a taxi, but
also which route the taxi should take; because this has a
direct effect on the fare they will pay. Such a solution can be
feasible especially in ride-hailing services where customers
choose their transport option prior to calling a vehicle.
There is an important tradeoff in our optimization: if taxi
fares are too high, then more people may choose to take the
train. While this decreases traffic congestion, high population
density in the train may increase the risk of infection. On
the other hand, too low taxi rates will hinder the recovery of
public transport, increasing the traffic congestion. In addition
to this tradeoff, allowing different fares for taxis based on
the road they are taking gives more opportunities while
still being fair to the customers2 : they can be financially
incentivized with lower fares to take longer roads, which
may keep the congestion low by preventing the quickest
roads from being overused.
To formulate our optimization for taxi fares, we elaborate
on each transportation medium in the subsequent sections.
3.1 Roads
We consider 𝑛 parallel roads and use [𝑛] = {1, 2, . . . , 𝑛} to
denote the set of all roads. We denote the free-flow latency
of road 𝑖, the time it takes to drive from origin to destination
without any congestion, by 𝑎𝑖 .

1 Our

framework easily generalizes to the networks with no railroad or
no walking path. One will simply need to remove those options and the
corresponding constraints.
2 Fairness is satisfied because all taxi customers using the same road pay
the same fare.

ICCPS ’21, May 19–21, 2021, Nashville, TN, USA

Beliaev et al.

Latency. Private cars and taxis share the roads, so they both
contribute to road congestion. The latency of a road depends
on how many vehicles are using it. We use the traffic model
proposed by the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR model) [12, 34]
to mathematically formulate this latency. This model has
been widely used in literature for traffic management [13],
simulations [16], urban-scale analysis [29, 48], and modeling
mixed-autonomy traffic [30, 32, 33].
We let 𝑓𝑖𝑐 denote the flow of private cars on road 𝑖, i.e.,
the number of private cars who use road 𝑖 per unit time.
Similarly, 𝑓𝑖𝑡 denotes the flow of taxis on road 𝑖. Then the
total flow of vehicles on road 𝑖 is 𝑓𝑖𝑣 = 𝑓𝑖𝑐 + 𝑓𝑖𝑡 . According to
the BPR model, the latency of this road is
h
 𝑓 𝑣 𝛽 i
ℓ𝑖𝑣 (𝑓𝑖𝑣 ) = 𝑎𝑖 1 + 𝛼 𝑖
,
(1)
𝑐𝑖
where 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑐𝑖 are constants denoting the free-flow latency
and capacity of the road, respectively, and 𝛼, 𝛽 ∈ R>0 are the
parameters of the BPR model. The capacity 𝑐𝑖 is proportional
to the length and number of lanes of the road.
We then write the aggregate latency incurred per unit
time on road 𝑖 and over the entire network as:
𝐿𝑖𝑣 (𝑓𝑖𝑣 ) = 𝑓𝑖𝑣 · ℓ𝑖𝑣 (𝑓𝑖𝑣 ) ,
∑︁
𝐿 𝑣 (𝒇 𝑣 ) =
𝐿𝑖𝑣 (𝑓𝑖𝑣 ) ,

(2)
(3)

𝑖 ∈ [𝑛]

respectively, where 𝒇 𝑣 is the vector that consists of 𝑓𝑖𝑣 for
𝑖 = 1, 2, . . . , 𝑛. This is total latency incurred per unit time,
because 𝑓𝑖𝑣 denotes the flow, i.e., number of people per unit
time, using road 𝑖.
Monetary Cost. Our goal is to optimize taxi fares for each
road. We denote these fares as 𝑥𝑖𝑡 for 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛]. On the other
hand, we do not assume any control over the monetary cost
of traveling with private cars, due to gas prices, tolling, etc.
We neglect the deviations on the cost due to the effect of
congestion on gas prices, and assume the cost is only affected
by the characteristics of the road, e.g., its length and nominal
vehicle speed. Therefore, 𝑥𝑖𝑐 is a constant for the monetary
cost of taking road 𝑖 with a private car.
Risk of Infection. Private cars do not pose an extra threat
in terms of infection, because they do not create new close
interactions between people. On the other hand, taxis create
an interaction between the passenger and the driver. Therefore, while the risk of infection is 0 for private cars, we let 𝑟¯𝑡
denote the risk of infection per unit time3 for a single taxi.
This value is affected by many factors that vary from city
to city: the size and ventilation of taxis, whether there is a
protective shield between the driver and the passenger, etc.
And what is important is the ratio between 𝑟¯𝑡 and the risk of
infection in other transportation modes. Therefore, to keep
3 Higher

viral loads (the total number of virus particles taken in) might
increase the severity of the disease. See, for example, [46].

our model general, we do not make additional assumptions
about 𝑟¯𝑡 , which should be decided by health authorities.
Since longer interactions increase the risk, we model the
total risk of infection a taxi causes during a trip on road 𝑖 as
𝑟𝑖𝑡 (𝑓𝑖𝑣 ) = 𝑟¯𝑡 · ℓ𝑖𝑣 (𝑓𝑖𝑣 ) ,

(4)

and total risk over the network per unit time due to taxis as
∑︁
∑︁
𝑅𝑡 (𝒇 𝑣 ) =
𝑓𝑖𝑡 · 𝑟𝑖𝑡 =
𝑓𝑖𝑡 · 𝑟¯𝑡 · ℓ𝑖𝑣 (𝑓𝑖𝑣 ) .
(5)
𝑖 ∈ [𝑛]

𝑖 ∈ [𝑛]

This is per unit time, because 𝑓𝑖𝑡 denotes the flow, i.e., number
of people per unit time, using taxis.
Having modeled the roads, we now continue with the
railway in our transportation network.
3.2 Railway
Our network includes a railway from the origin to the destination for the train option. Railways have a physical capacity
that determines at most how many people can take trains
per unit time. We let this capacity be 𝑐 𝑟 . We then define 𝑓 𝑟
as the flow of people using the train, such that 0 ≤ 𝑓 𝑟 ≤ 𝑐 𝑟
must be satisfied.
Latency. Since trains operate on a schedule, the latency of a
train is affected by neither how congested the roads are nor
the number of people taking the train. Using railway from
origin to destination takes a duration of constant ℓ 𝑟 . Similar
to roads, we can write the aggregate latency incurred per
unit time on the railway as
𝐿𝑟 (𝑓 𝑟 ) = 𝑓 𝑟 · ℓ 𝑟 .

(6)

Monetary Cost. Although the fares of taxis can be dynamically optimized based on the demand, railway has a fixed
fare4 . We let 𝑥 𝑟 denote the fare of the railway.
Risk of Infection. A very crucial aspect of the railway
is that it may cause high risk of infection depending on
how many people are aboard. We let 𝑟¯𝑟 denote the total
risk of infection per unit time per person on a railway that
operates at full capacity, i.e., when 𝑓 𝑟 = 𝑐 𝑟 . Again letting
health authorities decide 𝑟¯𝑟 (relative to 𝑟 𝑡 ), we can model the
risk of infection per person during one trip in the railway as
𝑓𝑟
.
(7)
𝑐𝑟
The total risk of infection due to the railway per unit time is
then written as
𝑟 𝑟 (𝑓 𝑟 ) = ℓ 𝑟 · 𝑟¯𝑟 ·

𝑓 𝑟2
.
(8)
𝑐𝑟
Next, we proceed to the model of the walking path to
finalize our transportation network model.
𝑅𝑟 (𝑓 𝑟 ) = 𝑓 𝑟 · 𝑟 𝑟 (𝑓 𝑟 ) = ℓ 𝑟 · 𝑟¯𝑟 ·

4 Even

though it may require important changes in the infrastructure, variable railway fares might be interesting to explore and provide additional
benefits. Our formulation can be easily generalized to optimize for train
fares in addition to taxi fares.

3.3 Walking Path
Our network has a walking path from origin to destination
for people who do not want to use the other modes of transport. We denote the flow of these people, pedestrians, as 𝑓 𝑝 .
While we use a simple model for pedestrians, it again poses
the same latency-risk tradeoff: having many people walk
will reduce both the risk (compared to taxis and railway) and
the congestion in the roads, but is not a desirable scenario,
as pedestrians themselves will experience huge delays.
Latency. Dividing the path length by the average human
walking speed, we assume the latency of a pedestrian is a
constant, denoted by ℓ 𝑝 . The aggregate latency incurred per
unit time on the walking path is then
𝐿𝑝 (𝑓 𝑝 ) = 𝑓 𝑝 · ℓ 𝑝 .

(9)

Monetary Cost. There is no monetary cost associated with
walking to the destination.
Risk of Infection. The risk of infection for pedestrians
depends on many external factors. For example, it increases
if there are crowded places on the path, or it may decrease if
policies enforce people to practice social distancing and wear
face coverings. We denote the risk of infection per person per
unit time on the path as 𝑟¯𝑝 , and so the total risk of infection
per person on the walking path is 𝑟 𝑝 = ℓ 𝑝 · 𝑟¯𝑝 , and the total
risk over the network per unit time is
𝑅 𝑝 (𝑓 𝑝 ) = 𝑓 𝑝 · 𝑟 𝑝 .

(10)

Having modeled all the mediums in our network, we are
now ready to formulate the optimization problem for taxi
fares in order to influence routing decisions of people and
bring down the total latency and risk of infection.

Optimizing Safety & Efficiency

We first start with formulating our optimization objective,
and then the constraints. Finally in Section 4.3, we present
the overall optimization problem.
4.1 Objective
Our goal is to optimize the taxi fares such that all people in
the network will experience both low risk of infection and
low latency. The network model we presented in Section 3
allows us to model these two objectives:
𝑣

Risk: 𝑅(𝒇 , 𝑓 , 𝑓 ) = 𝑅 (𝒇 ) + 𝑅 (𝑓 ) + 𝑅 (𝑓 ) , (12)
Our problem is then a multi-objective optimization where
we try to minimize a weighted sum of (11) and (12). Next,
we formulate the constraints of our optimization.
4.2 Constraints
Fare Constraints. While we assume the city planner determines the taxi fares, we still need to make sure taxi drivers
make profit, so we cannot set the fares arbitrarily low.
One can think of a solution where some minimum profit
constraint is imposed over the entire network (similar to [5]).

However, this requires some centralization to balance the
profits because the optimization may produce very low fares
for longer roads and high fares for shorter roads to satisfy the
profit constraint. In such a case, the taxis operating on the
shorter roads would make a lot of profit while the other taxis
are losing money. As taxis are usually decentralized, it is not
realistic to assume a central authority will compensate the
taxi drivers who lose money by taxing the ones who make
more profit. This can, however, be an interesting direction for
ride-hailing apps which naturally have a centralized system.
In this work, we instead impose the fare constraints separately for each road to make sure all taxis make profit. For
this, we impose a minimum fare 𝑥𝑖𝑡 ≥ 𝑥¯𝑖𝑡 for each road 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛]
where 𝑥¯𝑖𝑡 can be determined by how much minimum profit
is desired for each trip on road 𝑖. One can think of 𝑥¯𝑖𝑡 proportional to 𝑥¯𝑖𝑐 , depending on gas-efficiency of the taxis.
Flow Constraints. While we can financially incentivize
people to take different modes of transportation by optimizing taxi fares, we cannot explicitly force them to take a particular mode. Hence, we are constrained by their preferences.
To model humans’ choices of the mode of transportation,
we let 𝒉 be a discrete probability distribution over 2𝑛 + 2
transport options: 𝑛 options with private cars, 𝑛 with taxis, 1
with the railway and 1 as a pedestrian. The vector 𝒉 sums up
to one and consists of the following terms: ℎ𝑐𝑖 for 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛], ℎ𝑖𝑡
for 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛], ℎ𝑟 and ℎ𝑝 . Each of these represents what fraction
of the total flow chooses the corresponding transport option.
The vector 𝒉 of course depends on the latencies, monetary
costs and the risks of infection of all transport options. Hence,
we let it be a function: 𝒉(ℓ, 𝒙, 𝒓). Here ℓ, 𝒙 and 𝒓 denote the
vectors that consist of the latency, monetary cost and risk
of infection, respectively, for all transport options. For now,
we treat the preference distribution 𝒉(ℓ, 𝒙, 𝒓) as a black-box
function to complete our optimization formulation, and defer
its derivation to Section 5.
4.3 Overall Optimization Problem
Letting 𝐹 denote the total demand per unit time, we can
write the overall optimization problem as:

Preference Distribution Model

The only missing component in our optimization is how
we model the preference distribution 𝒉(ℓ, 𝒙, 𝒓). While all
humans will presumably choose transport options to minimize their latency, monetary cost, and risk of infection, their
tradeoff between these factors differ: some people prioritize minimizing their monetary cost whereas some prioritize
reaching their destination as early as possible. Moreover,
people may have other biases. For example, one may prefer
taking a taxi rather than driving a car so that they can read
during the trip, or one may prefer walking to stay healthy.
To incorporate such preferences, we model humans as
agents optimizing a utility function that captures their preferences. For this, we first assume humans will not choose
dominated options, i.e., options that have no advantage over
some other option and have at least one disadvantage. Formally, option 𝑗, denoted by 𝑜 𝑗 , is dominated by 𝑜 𝑗 ′ if:
𝑜 𝑗 and 𝑜 𝑗 ′ are the same mode of transportation, and

ℓ 𝑗 ′ ≤ ℓ 𝑗 ∧ 𝑥 𝑗 ′ ≤ 𝑥 𝑗 ∧ 𝑟 𝑗 ′ ≤ 𝑟 𝑗 , and
(14)

ℓ𝑗 ′ < ℓ𝑗 ∨ 𝑥 𝑗 ′ < 𝑥 𝑗 ∨ 𝑟 𝑗 ′ < 𝑟 𝑗 ,

Having defined a utility function for a human whose preferences are encoded with a vector 𝝎, we now adopt a widelyused probabilistic model from discrete choice theory to calculate the probability of the human choosing each option:
multinomial logit model [2]. This model has been extensively used both in transportation engineering [5, 26] and
preference-based learning [6, 39]. According to this model,
the probability of the human choosing 𝑜 𝑗 among all options
available to them, O, is:
exp(𝑢 𝝎 (𝑜 𝑗 ))
.
𝑜 𝑗 ′ ∈ O exp(𝑢 𝝎 (𝑜 𝑗 ′ ))

𝑃𝝎 (𝑜 𝑗 | O) = Í

(17)

This model makes sure the dominated options have 0 probability of being chosen, as their utilities are −∞. Moreover,
this model allows us to handle users with different transport
options. For example, O may or may not include the private
car option, depending on whether the user owns a car or not.
We let O𝑘 denote the options available to the user 𝑘.
We also let 𝑔𝑘 denote the distribution over user 𝑘’s preferences, i.e. their preference vector 𝝎. Then, the preference
distribution 𝒉(ℓ, 𝒙, 𝒓) of the entire population of users can
be written as:
𝑁 ∫
1 ∑︁
ℎ 𝑗 (ℓ, 𝒙, 𝒓) =
𝑃 𝝎 (𝑜 𝑗 | O𝑘 )𝑔𝑘 (𝝎)𝑑𝝎
(18)
𝑁
R7
𝑘=1

where ℓ 𝑗 , 𝑥 𝑗 and 𝑟 𝑗 represent the latency, monetary cost and
the risk of option 𝑜 𝑗 , respectively, and similarly ℓ 𝑗 ′ , 𝑥 𝑗 ′ and
𝑟 𝑗 ′ represent those of option 𝑜 𝑗 ′ . Note that the railway and
the walking path cannot be dominated as there is only one
option each for them. The set of dominated options can be
written as:
𝐷 = {𝑜 𝑗 | 𝑜 𝑗 ′ dominates 𝑜 𝑗 for some option 𝑜 𝑗 ′ } ,

(15)

Then, we model the utility of a human user, parameterized
by 𝝎 ∈ R7 , as:
𝑢 𝝎 (𝑜 𝑗 ) = 𝜔 1 ℓ 𝑗 + 𝜔 2𝑥 𝑗 + 𝜔 3𝑟 𝑗 +

where 𝑜 𝑗 denotes the chosen transport option. Here, the
first three elements of 𝝎 characterize the tradeoff between
the three factors of latency, cost, and risk, whereas the last
four model humans’ biases towards the different modes of
transportation. Presumably, the first three elements of 𝝎
must be negative, penalizing high latency, cost and risk, for
all humans. Such linear utility functions are common in
preference-based learning as they are expressive enough
to capture most of the important information [6, 39, 47].
Extensions to nonlinear models are possible with the use of
Gaussian processes [3].

for each transport option 𝑗, where 𝑁 is the population. This
computation can be efficiently performed via sampling from
𝑔𝑘 ’s using, for example, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
In the next section, we discuss how data-driven methods
can be leveraged to learn the distributions 𝑔𝑘 , which will
then complete our framework.

Learning User Preferences

We take a Bayesian approach to learn the distributions 𝑔𝑘
of humans’ preferences. In this approach, there exists a data
set for each human that consists of their selected option
as well as the options that were available to them while
making their choice. While one can combine all data sets to
learn a single 𝑔, learning a distribution for each human is
advantageous, because this allows further personalizing our
model to specific populations, such as people who travel in
the early morning or later in the day. For example, people
traveling early in the morning might care more about latency
on their way to work, whereas travelers who leave later in
the day may want to enjoy some nice weather by walking.
Therefore, we learn a separate distribution for each user, and
𝑔 is simply the average of such distributions associated with
the humans traveling at that time.
Given a data sample for human 𝑘 where they chose option
𝑜 𝑗 among available options O𝑘 , we use Bayes’ rule5 to update
5 The

prior 𝑔𝑘 (𝝎) depends on the city. While a simple prior is a uniform
distribution over the 7-dimensional unit ball, experts could incorporate
their domain knowledge about the people using the network into this prior.

the posterior 𝑔𝑘 :


𝑔𝑘 𝝎 | 𝑜 𝑗 , O𝑘 ∝ 𝑔𝑘 (𝝎)𝑃𝝎 (𝑜 𝑗 | O𝑘 ) .

(19)

Assuming conditional independence of different choices, the
posterior learned with the full data set of the human 𝑘 is:
Ö
𝑔𝑘 (𝝎 | D) ∝ 𝑔𝑘 (𝝎)
𝑃𝝎 (𝑜 𝑗 | O𝑘 ) ,
(20)
(𝑜 𝑗 | O𝑘 ) ∈ D

where D denotes the data set.
This learning approach yields better estimates of 𝑔𝑘 as we
collect more data of human 𝑘. While we can generate more
data by running our optimization in (13) on real network
instances, this optimization is only designed to optimize
for taxi fares and is not designed for optimally collecting
data from humans for learning their preferences. Hence, it
does not necessarily generate queries (transport options)
that will lead to significant improvements in our estimates
of 𝑔𝑘 , which may, in turn, hurt the performance of network
optimization. To overcome this problem, we present an optional active querying method based on information gain
in the subsequent section, which optimizes the queries, i.e.
their latencies, monetary costs and risks without necessarily
satisfying the network dynamics to learn the humans’ preferences optimally. Such an approach could be employed in
practice by, for example, having a survey for humans who
enter the network for the first time.
6.1 Active Querying
To enable faster learning of 𝑔𝑘 , we use an active learning
method that optimizes the information gained from each
query about the distribution 𝑔𝑘 of 𝝎. While prior works used
a volume removal based active learning approach where the
goal is to maximize the volume removed from the distribution 𝑔𝑘 [5, 17, 39], Bıyık et al. [6] showed maximizing mutual
information leads to both faster learning and easier queries
for the humans. In this method, each query is optimized after
receiving the human’s choice:



max 𝐼 (𝝎; 𝑜 𝑗 | O𝑘 ) = max 𝐻 (𝝎 | O𝑘 ) −E𝑜 𝑗 𝐻 (𝝎 | 𝑜 𝑗 , O𝑘 ) ,
O𝑘

O𝑘

(21)
where 𝐼 is the mutual information, 𝐻 is the information
entropy [10], and 𝑜 𝑗 is the random variable representing
the selected transport option. After sampling 𝝎 ∼ 𝑔𝑘 (𝝎)
and letting the set of samples be Ω, the optimization (21) is
asymptotically equal to
∑︁ ∑︁
𝑃𝝎 (𝑜 𝑗 | O𝑘 )
max
𝑃𝝎 (𝑜 𝑗 | O𝑘 ) log Í
(22)
O𝑘
′
𝝎 ∈Ω 𝑃 𝝎 ′ (𝑜 𝑗 | O𝑘 )
𝝎 ∈Ω
𝑜 𝑗 ∈ O𝑘

as the number of 𝝎 samples in Ω goes to infinity. We refer
to [6] for the full derivation.
We want to note again that this optimization is not subject
to the constraints of the optimization we presented in (13),
because the goal here is to learn the user preferences as
quickly as possible using some artificial queries that ask the
users about their transportation preferences.

Having presented our approach to learn humans’ preferences over transport options and our active querying approach to accelerate learning, our framework is complete.

Experiments & Results

In this section, we present our experiments and the results.
We divide the experiments into two parts: a user study where
we learn user preferences with the approach described in
Section 6, and a case study on a simulated traffic network
where we optimize the taxi fares as formulated in Section 4
using the preferences learned in the user study.
7.1 Learning User Preferences
To perform the optimization for a given traffic network, we
first need to learn the distribution of humans’ preferences,
𝑔𝑘 ’s. For this, we surveyed 17 people across the United States
during the second half of 2020, using the active learning
framework we described in Section 6.1.
The participants were first explained the purpose of the
survey, as well as the underlying model for calculating the
risk of infection. Their place of residence, whether they were
tested positive before for COVID-19, and their informed
consent were collected. Each participant then answered 10
actively generated queries, followed by 6 queries that were
randomly generated. We used the latter set of queries to
test the accuracy of the predicted utility parameters 𝝎: we
looked at for how many of those queries our estimated 𝝎’s
could correctly predict the actual participant response. Each
query consisted of 6 choices —two roads with private cars
and taxis, a railway, and a walking path. For the transport
options, we provided the users with the estimated latencies,
monetary costs and the estimated densities to give them an
easily interpretable measure of infection risk.
To validate the impact of the pandemic on humans’ transport choices, we attempted to model the pre-pandemic distribution of people’s preferences, as well. For this, we asked the
same participants to repeat the survey as if they were making their decisions prior to the pandemic. All 17 participants
attended this second round survey.
The validation accuracy of our learning model is 97.1%
for pre-pandemic conditions, and 89.8% for post-pandemic.
As each query consisted of 6 transport options, these high
accuracy values indicate we were able to accurately model
participants’ preferences. The decrease in the accuracy from
pre-pandemic to post-pandemic might be because risk of
infection is less relevant in the pre-pandemic case,6 making
the learning easier.
Using the preference data we collected, we generated two
sets of preference distributions. Fig. 2 visualize the tradeoffs
for each of the 17 study participants, where small points

of infection is not completely irrelevant in the pre-pandemic case, as
people would generally prefer transport options with fewer people due to
comfort, hygiene, etc.

ICCPS ’21, May 19–21, 2021, Nashville, TN, USA

show the samples from their 𝑔𝑘 (𝝎), and the mean of the
distribution is indicated with a large point.
We see from Fig. 2 how the pandemic affected humans’
relative tradeoffs between latency, monetary cost, and risk of
infection. The majority of participants (14 out of 17) showed
an increase in their regard for risk relative to monetary cost,
and the changes in the other three are much smaller. This
shows that people are putting a higher weight on the risk of
infection associated with a travel option.
Moreover, the majority (13 out of 17) showed a decrease
in their regard for latency relative to monetary cost. In the
post-pandemic case, people are more willing to sacrifice their
time for monetary considerations. This shows that our idea
of using financial incentives to influence the state of the
traffic network can in fact be effective.
It is interesting to point out that the only two participants
whose preference ratios significantly moved rightward, i.e.
who started caring more about latency, were the only two
participants who were infected with and cured for COVID19 prior to the surveys. This might be because they have less
fear of being re-infected.
Having validated people are more concerned about the
risk of infection, and shown the usability of our preferencebased learning framework, we now proceed to the simulated
traffic network experiments.
7.2 Case Study
To show the benefits of our optimization framework, we
designed a case study with a traffic network consisting of
four modes of transportation. The network we used is similar
to the depiction given in Fig. 1, containing 𝑛 = 2 roads, a
railway, and a walking path, all connecting one O-D pair.
The free-flow latencies of the two roads are 𝑎 1 = 30 minutes and 𝑎 2 = 45 minutes. Their capacities are 𝑐 1 = 900 and
𝑐 2 = 600 vehicles per minute. The monetary cost associated
with driving a private car on these roads is 𝑥 1𝑐 = $15 and
𝑥 2𝑐 = $9. The minimum taxi fares for the two roads are 𝑥¯1𝑡 = $9
and 𝑥¯2𝑡 = $5. Road 1 can be thought of as a high-capacity,
high-cost freeway option, while road 2 is a low-capacity, lowcost street. The train latency, capacity, and fare are ℓ 𝑟 = 35
minutes, 𝑐 𝑟 = 1500 passengers per minute, and 𝑥 𝑟 = $3
respectively. The walking path latency is ℓ 𝑝 = 120 minutes.
We set the parameters related to risk of infection in our
simulated problem as follows. Risks of infection per minute
for taxis and pedestrians are 𝑟¯𝑡 = 𝑟¯𝑝 = 1. For the railway, we
set the risk of a full capacity train (per minute) as 𝑟¯𝑟 = 10.
The flow demand for this network is set to 𝐹 = 3000
people per minute. We simulated this population using the
𝝎 samples we obtained from the user studies presented in
Section 7.1. To separate the population of car-owners from
the rest, as they will have different routing options O𝑘 , we
simulated 10 of the participants as car-owners. Those users
are indicated with a car icon in Fig. 2.

Beliaev et al.

We used a Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm
developed by [27] to locally solve the optimization, and repeated with 100 random initializations to get closer to the
global optimum. We performed this procedure for the two
data sets (pre- and post-pandemic) as well as varying values
of 𝛾. Fig. 3 depicts the effect 𝛾 has on the tradeoff between
latency and risk of infection in our objective function. As
expected, increasing 𝛾 helps minimize risk of infection. The
constraints enforced by users’ post-pandemic preferences
put higher priority on risk of infection as opposed to latency,
making aggregate risk of infection less sensitive to changes
in 𝛾. On the other hand, for pre-pandemic preferences, people’s disregard for risk and larger regard for latency make 𝛾
have a larger effect on risk of infection as opposed to latency.
Finally, Fig. 4 shows the specific solutions for three different 𝛾 under pre-pandemic and post-pandemic conditions.
Higher 𝛾 leads to lower risk of infection by populating the
railway less, whereas lower 𝛾 decreases traffic congestion.

Conclusion

Summary. We proposed a complete framework consisting
of a learning and a planning module: we first learn humans’ transport preferences in a data-driven way using active preference-based learning. We then use these learned
preferences to optimize taxi fares in traffic networks. Our
user study results align with the expert predictions [20]
and larger-scale surveys [18], and simulation experiments
demonstrate the usability and the benefits of the framework.
Discussion. Due to the sensitive nature of the topic at hand,
one should consider the moral implications that our results
make. On the positive side, our results show that financial
incentives can be used to decrease the risk of infection and accelerate the recovery of public transport. However, there is a
natural tradeoff between these two objectives, which means
hypothetically financial incentives could be used in ways
that put riders at risk in order to recover public transport
more quickly. Our goal here is not to advocate for such an
approach, but to better understand people’s preferences. We
hope that authorities take the necessary precautions to decrease infection risks under a certain level, and use financial
incentives only afterwards to recover public transport.
Limitations and Future Work. In this paper, we studied
traffic networks that consist of parallel roads and a single OD pair. While this is a common assumption (as in [4, 5, 28]),
extensions to general network topologies remain as a future
work: one can think of enumerating all possible paths from
all origins to all destinations and then calculating the path
latencies as the sum of corresponding roads’ latencies. In our
case study, we considered a network with only two parallel
roads for the clarity of presentation. While the real-world
applications do not usually involve many parallel roads, our

framework is scalable to the larger number of roads. Moreover, our user studies are limited due to the number of participants and the inherent bias people might have due to the
pandemic while attending the pre-pandemic survey. Finally,
we assumed the risk of infection is proportional to the interaction time in trains and taxis and for pedestrians. While this
may not be accurate, our framework can be easily modified
for better risk modeling.

lines depict road 1, the railway, the walking path, and road 2 from top to bottom. As 𝛾 increases, our framework fiscally incentivizes users to
take the taxi on road 1. This helps minimize the number of passengers on the railway, as well as the number of pedestrians on the walking
path. Note that the price for a taxi on road 2 does not have to follow a trend as 𝛾 increases, but only has to stay higher than the price for a
taxi on road 1 so that it remains as a dominated option to make sure all the taxis go on road 1.
