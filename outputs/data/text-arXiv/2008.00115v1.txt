Abstract

mitigation efforts. The design of such strategies hinges on
effective surveillance of the spatiotemporal evolution of disease. Hence, a reliable and relatively interpretable method
of forecasting the spread of the virus could significantly improve the predictive surveillance capability and help in designing policies for disease containment.
Facing this need, prior research has proposed and tested
various statistical, epidemiological and machine learningbased forecasting models for COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
[6] [7] based on features such as number of existing infections, deaths and recoveries. Other forecasting models proposed for other epidemics [8] [9] [10] rely on features like human mobility and within-season and betweenseason observations. Although these models show potential for predicting the initial outbreak and growth trajectories, their capability in capturing various temporally dynamic and spatially variant features affecting disease spread
is limited [11]. For example, mathematical models such as
susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) models only account
for a small subset of relevant features identified to be responsible for the spread of the virus, as shown below.
Existing studies [12] have shown that the spread of disease is dependent on many factors; thus, reliable forecasting models must capture all major factors that might influence the spread of infection. Specifically, a multitude of
factors including, but not limited to, human mobility [13],
social distancing guidelines [14] [15], weather [16], population density [17], and demographics [18] affect the spread
of COVID-19. In other fields of study where prediction
also depends upon a large number of features, researchers
often find that identifying interactions between input features is essential to yielding satisfactory results [19] [20].
Although, to the best of our knowledge, no literature has
yet been published that identifies specific feature interactions for the spread of COVID-19, we hypothesize that it
is quite likely that many features upon which the spread is
dependent interact in complex ways. Hence, an exhaustive
examination of the relevant features and their possible interactions is essential for an effective prediction model of
disease spread.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning model to forecast the range of increase in COVID-19 infected cases in
future days and we present a novel method to compute
equidimensional representations of multivariate time series and multivariate spatial time series data. Using this
novel method, the proposed model can both take in a large
number of heterogeneous features, such as census data,
intra-county mobility, inter-county mobility, social distancing data, past growth of infection, among others, and learn
complex interactions between these features. Using data
collected from various sources, we estimate the range of increase in infected cases seven days into the future for all
U.S. counties. In addition, we use the model to identify the
most influential features for prediction of the growth of infection. We also analyze pairs of features and estimate the
amount of observed second-order interaction between them.
Experiments show that the proposed model obtains satisfactory predictive performance and fairly interpretable feature analysis results; hence, the proposed model could complement the standard epidemiological models for nationallevel surveillance of pandemics, such as COVID-19. The
results and findings obtained from the deep learning model
could potentially inform policymakers and researchers in
devising effective mitigation and response strategies. To
fast-track further development and experimentation, the
code used to implement the proposed model has been made
fully open source.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 has had an unprecedented social and economic impact worldwide. With more than 13 million infected cases and more than half a million deaths as of
mid-July, the pandemic is still accelerating globally without showing any signs of nearing an end. In dealing with
COVID-19 and future pandemics, it is imperative to design
reliable intervention strategies and to implement effective

Advances in deep learning can enable contemporary
models to use a large number of features and to account
for possible interactions. Several deep learning models [21]
[22] [23] used for online ad click predictions are particularly
known for using multiple heterogeneous features as input
and learning interactions among them; however, since many
features used for epidemic forecasting are in the form of
multivariate time series and multivariate spatial time series,
an effective method to compute representations of such features that accounts for both the temporal and spatial structure of data is essential before using them as input to the
aforementioned models. Perhaps, due to the challenges associated with building such representations for heterogeneous input features, existing deep learning models for epidemic forecasting rely upon more conventional recurrent architectures that do not explicitly account for feature interactions and consider only few input features [5] [1] [24].
To complement existing epidemiological models, we
propose a deep learning model based on the high-level
framework of DeepFM [21] that takes in multiple features, accounts for interactions between them and forecasts
growth in the number of infected cases in all U.S. counties. For effective processing of the many input features,
the model includes a novel method to compute equidimensional representations (also called embeddings) of heterogeneous features such as multivariate time series, multivariate
spatial time series, and multidimensional time-independent
variables. Furthermore, we perform feature importance
evaluations to identify the most influential features for predicting the growth of infected cases. Also, since the proposed model accounts for possible interactions among input features, we perform an analysis to estimate the relative
amount of second-order interaction between pairs of input
features. The results show that the model obtains satisfactory performance. In addition, the highly interpretable feature importance results can also help policy makers develop
control strategies in response to the rapidly evolving pandemic situation. To fast-track future research and experimentation with new features or models, we have also made
our code fully open source.

the community spread of disease [27]. While these models provide useful insights regarding the initial outbreak
and growth trajectories, they have limitations in terms of
the number of influencing factors and complex relationships
captured. For example, existing models can include only a
limited number of features (primarily infection rate) to forecast the spread of infection; however, research has shown
that disease spread is related to a large number of factors
(such as socio-demographic factors, mobility, population
density, and visits to points of interest), which possibly interact in complex ways. Data-driven models can be adopted
to capture various dynamic features and their interactions to
complement the standard disease-spread models.
Existing studies also reveal that population flow drives
the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 cases [28],
and travel ban was projected to be successful in slowing
the epidemic spread. This has been demonstrated in the
context of COVID-19 in China [29]. To complement existing mathematical disease spread models, the global epidemic and mobility model [9] was developed to incorporate
the movement of people (which may hasten transmission of
the disease across different areas) and predict the spread of
disease. This model focuses mainly on cross- and withincommunity transmission of the disease through the analysis of global human mobility; however, as shown in recent
literature, the spread of the disease is affected not only by
human contact, but is also related to multiple additional factors, such as population density, human shopping activities,
and directives of local government [14] [15] [13] [30]. Existing models have a limited capability to capture the effects
of these factors; hence, developing a model that can take
various relevant factors into account, predict the spread of
disease, and attribute importance to each factor could be informative for pandemic surveillance and associated policy
making.

2.2. Deep learning models
Several researchers have identified that predictive models based on deep learning could be effective in aiding decision making in response to COVID-19 [32] [33] [34].
Huang et al. [4] proposed a convolutional neural network to
forecast the spread of the virus using six input features related to the number of confirmed, recovered, and deceased
people. Their model predicts the spread one day ahead using data from last five days. Although their work shows that
deep learning can be effective in forecasting the pandemic,
the model cannot be directly deployed in practice because it
predicts only one day of future scenario and considers only
a limited number features affecting the spread of disease.
Chimmula et al. [5] proposed a long short-term memory (LSTM) model [35] to forecast the spread of the virus
based on past number of confirmed, deceased, and recovered cases. Similarly, Tian et al. [24] also used an LSTM

2. Related Work
2.1. Standard disease-spread models
To estimate the growth of infected populations, epidemiologists and mathematical modelers have developed multiple statistical and mathematical models to simulate the
spread of disease in terms of susceptible, infected, recovered, and deceased populations. These models include
the susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) model and its derived models, such as the susceptible-exposed-infectiousrecovery (SEIR) model [25] [26]. Through contact activities of people, these standard models attempt to capture

model to forecast the spread based on similar features but
normalized by population. The authors also compared their
results with a Hidden Markov Model and a Hierarchial
Bayes Model, but concluded that LSTM exhibits the best
performance of the three, demonstrating the potential impact deep learning can have on pandemic forecasting.
Tian et al. [36] also proposed a custom model to forecast cumulative confirmed cases and deaths by combining
the LSTM [35] and GRU [37] cells. Their model used past
numbers of confirmed cases and deaths as input and five
other time-independent features. They reported their model
performance only in terms of relative error, so it is difficult to judge the effectiveness of their model in absolute
terms. Further, the authors did not clarify why some features, such as violent crime rate, were used in the model
and how these features could contribute to prediction of infections and deaths by COVID-19.
Further, an important and perhaps similar work is the
DeepCOVID model [38]. The associated researchers have
developed a deep learning-based forecasting model using
“syndromic, clinical, demographic, mobility, and point-ofcare data” to forecast mortality and hospitalization in the
United States. However, only a small amount of information (such as accuracy, model architecture, and feature importance) about this work has yet been made public.
To the best of our knowledge, the proposed DeepCOVIDNet model is among the first significant deep learning models for COVID-19 forecasting to be completely
open-source. Moreover, a notable distinction of our work
is that we perform feature analysis to understand which features are important in forecasting the growth of the virus,
an analysis not performed in prior studies. Further, we also
account for possible interactions among our many input features and identify pairs of features with relatively higher
amount of second-order interaction between them, which
again has not been done by other models.

To have a comprehensive understanding of the situation
and characteristics of counties, it is important to examine
several features for each county. To this end, we extensively
surveyed the literature and identified certain “influencing
factors” that might affect the spread of infection. We then
identified specific feature groups that corresponded with the
set of influencing factors identified earlier. A feature group
is simply a set of similar features grouped together to facilitate further processing. A brief description of all feature
groups is presented in table 1. In this section, we describe
the process of feature collection, organization, and inclusion in the proposed model in detail.

3.1. Feature Collection
Our extensive analysis of the literature helped us identify four factors that may influence the spread of COVID-19
both spatially and temporally. These “influencing factors”
include population attributes (such as population density,
age/race-based population distribution, etc.), population activities (such as visits to certain types of points of interest,
adherence to social distancing guidelines, etc.), mobility
(movement from more infected places to less infected ones),
and disease spread attributes (such as reproduction number,
growth of infections in past, etc.). The feature groups used
in correspondence with each influencing factor are shown
in table 2. A more complete discussion of all feature groups
is provided in the appendix 10. In the following, we provide
evidence to show the importance of each influencing factor
in predicting the growth of the virus.
Features related to population attributes, such as population size and density, are important in predicting the growth
of infection as shown by research studies discussed below.
Rocklöv and Sjödin [17] demonstrated that the spread of
the virus in a geography is directly proportional to its pop3

Table 2. The feature groups used in correspondence with each influencing factor

ulation density. Dyer [39] and Kirby [40] showed that the
impact of the pandemic has been disproportionately higher
in black and other minority communities. Dowd et al.
[18] illustrated how population age distribution and intergenerational contacts (possibly captured by household type
and size) affect the impact of the virus in a community. Together, these studies provide a strong rationale for using features that capture population attributes of counties by showing that these unchangeable population characteristics contribute significantly in understanding the spread/impact of
the virus. As shown in table 2, to account for population
attributes, we use census features, population density, and
some other engineered features built by the Surgo Foundation to assess vulnerability of each county due to COVID-19
(refer appendix 10).

Population
attributes

Multiple research studies have found that population activities are important in predicting the growth of future
cases. Benzell et al. [41] identified risks associated with
visits to venues at which people would be placed in proximity and showed that particularly high risk was associated
with visits to restaurants, grocery stores, fast food establishments, cafes, and gyms. Also, Lai et al. [42] found
that there is high risk of small disease outbreaks within residential facilities for elderly, indicating that examining the
number of visits to such facilities could be helpful in forecasting the growth of infection. Moreover, since research
has shown that COVID-19 is communicated via airborne
particles, especially indoors, visits to hospitals, especially
by healthcare workers, could be risky [43] [44], and therefore are important to consider when determining the growth
of infection. Further, Gao et al. [45] showed that adherence
to social distancing orders helps to reduce the spread of infection. Cohen and Kupferschmidt [46] and Sen-Crowe et
al. [47] also acknowledged the importance of social distancing in slowing the spread of the virus. Further, Béland
et al. [48] demonstrated that workers in certain occupations in which they are more likely to work in proximity are
more affected by the virus, indicating that the percentage
of people working full- or part-time could influence infection spread. These studies, together, show the importance of
capturing population activities as input features. As shown
in table 2, we use points of interest (POI) visitation patterns,
Venables distance [31], and social distancing metrics to capture these activities. As explained in appendix 10, visitation patterns capture the number of visits to important types
of POIs, Venables distance captures the agglomeration of
population activities in a county, and social distancing metrics show adherence to stay-at-home orders. Together, these
three feature groups show the extent to which people are
likely to come in close contact and potentially facilitate the
spread of infection.

et al. [13] showed that human mobility played a major role
in explaining the initial spatial distribution of infections in
China. They showed that more than 50% of initial cases
identified outside Wuhan could be traced back to travel from
Wuhan. Sirkeci et al. [49] also confirmed that human mobility from more infected places to less infected places is
a significant factor in predicting the spatial spread of the
virus. Other studies [50] [28] also concurred regarding the
role played by mobility in the spread of the virus. Therefore, we use data of incoming traffic from other counties to
capture mobility in the proposed model as shown in table 2.
We further augment the mobility information by including
the number of infections in source counties because travel
statistics alone are not sufficient to inform the model about
counties from which travel could be more dangerous due to
the high prevalence of infection.
Finally, disease spread attributes, such as the growth of
cases in the past few days and reproduction number, are also
important factors in determining the spread of virus in the
future. As mentioned in section 2, several existing models
[5] [24] [4] obtain satisfactory results in forecasting future
cases by using features similar to the growth of cases in
past days. Further, epidemiology-based studies [51] [52]
[53] have reported that estimating the reproduction number can be essential to understanding the behavior of virus
spread, thereby making it an important input feature to consider. Based on these studies, we include both the growth of
cases in past days and reproduction number (estimated by
the method proposed by Fan et al [51]) as input features to
the model.

3.2. Feature Organization
As discussed above, we combine similar features into
a feature group to better process and organize data. We
define three types of feature groups based on their spatial
and temporal characteristics as described below: constant,
time-dependent, and cross-county time-dependent feature

Further, the dynamics of urban mobility are also important in predicting the spatial spread of the virus. Kraemer

groups. The exact feature groups used in the model are
shown in table 1 and are fully explained in the appendix
10.
Constant Feature Groups: Constant feature groups
contain features that do not vary significantly over the analysis period. For example, the set of census features for
a county (such as population size and population density)
are considered constant features because their values do not
change significantly within a few months.
Time-Dependent Feature Groups: This group contains
features whose values change over time. For example, the
number of people who visit grocery stores on a particular
day in a given county is a time-dependent feature since its
value changes depending on the particular day. A timedependent feature group is essentially a multivariate time
series.
Cross-County Time-Dependent Feature Groups: In
cross-county time-dependent feature groups, features capture a time-dependent interaction between two counties. For
example, the number of people traveling from one county to
another on a particular day is a cross county time dependent
feature. A cross-county time-dependent feature group is essentially a multivariate spatial time series.

detail below for each feature group type. The fundamental idea behind extracting embeddings from various feature
groups is to utilize all available structure in the data. For
example, for time-dependent features, we would like the
model to be able to treat the same features on different dates
more similarly than different features on different dates. We
accomplish this goal by sharing parameters, which is a successful technique used to design novel models and arguably
is at the heart of the success of both recurrent and convolutional neural networks.

4. DeepCOVIDNet

Since the time dimension of time-dependent feature groups
needs to be taken into account, the shape of a timedependent feature group is [t, n], where t represents the time
steps, and n represents the number of features for each time
step. From the n input features, our method computes a
holistic feature score by performing a weighted summation
of the n original features for every time step. This holistic
score can be thought of as a new time-dependent feature,
engineered by the model as per its needs. Next, a weighted
summation is conducted over all time steps to learn the influence of different time steps on the final output. As shown
in equation 1, when the embedding size is e, the model has
a chance to engineer e new time-dependent features and understand how each new feature behaves over time.
In a formal formulation, let Ft ∈ Rt×n be a timedependent feature matrix of shape [t, n]. Let (Ft )ij represent the j th feature at the ith time step. Let the output
embedding be Et ∈ Re and (Et )k represent the k th element in the embedding. Then, we calculate (Et )k in the
following way:

4.1.1

Constant Feature Embeddings

Since constant feature groups do not have a time dimension, the shape of a group of constant features is simply [n],
where n is the number of features in the group. As shown
in figure 1, the embeddings of constant features are calculated simply by using a fully connected layer that converts
the input tensor of shape [n] to a tensor of shape [e] where
e is the embedding dimension.
4.1.2

We have designed a novel deep learning model, DeepCOVIDNet, to estimate the range of increase in the number
of infected cases on a particular day given multiple constant,
time-dependent, and cross-county time-dependent feature
groups as input. The “projection interval” of the model is
7 days, which means the model can forecast the range of
increase in cases for 7 days into the future.
The model comprises of two modules: the embedding
module and the DeepFM module. The embedding module
takes as input various heterogeneous feature groups and outputs an equidimensional embedding corresponding to each
feature group. These embeddings are then passed to the
DeepFM module which computes second- and higher-order
interactions between them. Finally, we use a shallow, fully
connected network which takes as input the computed interactions and the sum of feature embeddings (to improve
gradient flow) and outputs n probabilities corresponding to
n binary classification tasks, as explained in section 5. We
transform the n probabilities to get the probability distribution of the current rise in cases to lie within n + 1 ordered
ranges. We expect the rise in cases to lie within the range
with the greatest probability. Figure 1 shows a schematic
representation of the process described above.

Cross-County Time-Dependent Feature Embeddings

sum of all holistic feature scores for all counties. Finally, a
weighted combination of all time steps is computed.

4.2. DeepFM Module

Since each feature value of a cross-county time-dependent
feature group is associated with all counties and all time
steps, the shape of a cross-county time-dependent feature
group is [t, c, n], where t represents the total time steps, c
represents the total number of counties in the U.S. and n
represents the number of features.
As shown in figure 1, let Fcc ∈ Rt×c×n represent the raw
features so that (Fcc )ijk is the k th feature of the j th county
at the ith time step. Further, if we let Ecc ∈ Re represent the
final embedding of this feature group and (Ecc )p represent
the pth element of Ecc , then we compute (Ecc )p using an
extension of equation 1 in the following way:

We hypothesize that there exist several interactions between different feature groups. An interaction between two
features exists when their values together convey some information that cannot be extracted by considering their values individually. For example, there could be an interaction
between the percentage of population staying indoors in a
county and the total number of infected cases in the county.
A higher incidence of new cases is expected if few people
remain indoors and there are already a high number of infected cases. However, the model may not be able to predict
the number of new cases as effectively if only one of the two
feature values is given. Hence, it is important for the model
to identify and learn many such interactions that could exist among different features. In this section, we provide an
overview of how the model computes second- and higherorder interactions among input features using the DeepFM
[21] framework (with slight modifications).
The embeddings of all features obtained from the embeddings module described above serve as input to the
DeepFM model. Note that all raw features groups are of
different sizes, but their embeddings have the same dimensions and are easy to further process by the DeepFM module, as shown in figure 1.
In the model, the dot products between a pair of embeddings represent second-order interactions between the cor-

Note that equation 2 is an extension of equation 1 over
the county dimension. As in the previous case, the innermost summation computes a holistic feature score for every county and time step using the same weights. Next, an
overall score for each time step is computed by a weighted

through a self-normalizing neural network [54]. The network comprises of a sequence of dense layers with the same
output dimensions, followed by the SELU (Scaled Exponential Linear Units) non-linearity and the alpha dropout
layer [54]. We treat the number of dense layers and the dimension of their output as hyperparameters in the model,
which are tuned by using Bayesian optimization as explained in section 5.

Loss function. The proposed model predicts a range between which the rise in the number of infected cases is expected to lie. In this section, we describe how the model
is trained with this output. Let C ∈ Zn represent a list
containing boundaries of ranges used for prediction in the
model. Therefore, if the model predicts class i ∈ [0, n], the
rise in cases is expected to be within the interval [Ci , Ci+1 )
under the assumptions that C0 = 0 and Cn+1 = ∞. Naturally, Ci ≤ Ci+1 for all i.
Since C is sorted and ordered, we can treat the output
of the model as an ordinal variable and perform ordinal regression using the method described by Frank et al. [55].
According to the method, n binary classifiers need to be
trained such that classifier i ∈ [1, n] outputs the probability P (x > ci ), where x is the rise in number of cases and
ci is a constant. After n probabilities are obtained from
these n classifiers, we can easily find P (cj ≤ x < cj+1 )
for all j ∈ [0, n]. Finally, the rise in cases is expected to
lie in the interval [ck , ck+1 ) for some k ∈ [0, n] so that
∀i P (ck ≤ x < ck+1 ) ≥ P (ci ≤ x < ci+1 ). Frank et
al. [55] suggest that the model should be trained by using only binary cross entropy loss on the n binary classifiers. However, this could seem non-ideal because the final
goal is to predict the interval [cj , cj+1 ) rather than to predict
P (x > ci ) for all i. Therefore, for the proposed model, a
multi-class cross-entropy loss on P (ci ≤ x < ci+1 ) for all
i is added in addition to the binary cross-entropy loss on all
binary classifiers. The conducted experiments show that the
results are slightly better when this new loss term is added.
Class ranges for outputs. As described above, the proposed method predicts a range within which the increase in
the number of cases would lie. It is important to discuss
how range boundaries (i.e., list C) are actually chosen. Basically, we start by finding the rise in the number of cases
in every county from April 5 through June 28 during the
same projection interval of the model. We then find the
33rd , 67th and the 90th percentile of the rise in cases during those dates. In raw numbers, this turns out to be 1, 13,
and 93. So the output classes correspond to the following
ranges: 0 to 1 (negligible increase), 2 to 13 (moderately low
increase), 13 to 93 (moderately high increase), and 93 and

above (significantly high increase). These numbers denote
the rise in cases in every county during one week. Further,
it also should be noted that due to the distribution of the
labels, a naive model which predicts the same class always
would at most get 33% accuracy. This should also help contextualize our results. We achieved about 64% accuracy on
the testing data (June 12 through June 28), which is about
two times better than a naive model. In light of this and the
feature analysis results, we can be confident that the model
has learned useful information. It is also important to note
that these class boundaries can easily be changed to make
the model predictions finer or coarser as per different use
cases.
Train and test splits. The total data used was from
April 5 through June 28. 68% of this data was used for the
training set, 12% for validation and 20% for the testing set.
Equivalently, data from April 5 through June 1 was used for
training, June 2 through June 11 for validation, and June 12
through June 28 for testing. Although data since January
21 was available, we used data only from April 5 onward
because of the lack of widespread testing availability before
then. Since the model was trained on labels derived from
the results of COVID-19 testing data, it was essential to use
data that was relatively accurate and did not underestimate
the number of infections due to lack of testing [11].
Amount of Past Data Used. As explained in section 3,
the values of many input feature groups used in the model
change with time (time-dependent or cross-county timedependent feature groups). For all such features, we used
13 days of past data. We experimentally found that increasing the number of past days to 21 and 28 had insignificant
effect on the model accuracy. Therefore, for reasons related
to computational efficiency, we chose to use 13 days of past
data.

Therefore, the value of 0 means the model’s prediction was correct, 1 means it was one class away from ground truth, and so on. The

hyperparameters, and (2) helping decide a stopping point
for the second step to avoid/reduce overfitting.
Feature Analysis. For the model to be informative for
policy making, it should be explainable. To this end, we
adopted a simple and popular method to evaluate feature importance [57]. We first evaluated the accuracy of the model
on a small section of the training set. Next, we looped
through every feature in every feature group, randomized
its value, and reevaluated the model’s accuracy on the same
section of the training set. We assigned higher importance
to those features which when randomized cause greater decrease in the model accuracy.
A similar analysis was performed to determine feature
values at which time steps are the most important in determining the final output. To perform this analysis, we randomized all features on a given time step, and then assigned
greater importance to those time steps which when randomized cause greater decrease in performance.
Feature Interaction Analysis. As described in section
4, the DeepCOVIDNet model explicitly computes secondorder interactions between input feature groups. Due to
this explicit representation of second-order interactions, it
is possible to identify pairs of features between which high
amount of interaction is observed. To perform this analysis, we evaluated the network on a section of the training set
and tracked the magnitude of activations in the vector representing the second-order interactions of input features. We

So, to be clear, when predicting the range of increase in
infected cases on, for example, June 21, we use input data
from June 1 to June 13. Features from June 14 through 20
are not given as input because that represents the interval
for which the model is predicting the rise in cases.
Hyperparameter Tuning. We used Bayesian optimization for 30 iterations with expected improvement as the acquisition function to choose hyperparameters for the model
[56].
Training Method. As shown in figure 2, the model’s
testing results become less accurate as it is tested on dates
further in time from the dates on which it was trained. Since
the dates of the training, validation, and testing set are in ascending order, we hypothesized that training on the validation set as well should improve testing performance, since
more recent dates will be used in training. In light of this
belief, the model is trained in two steps.
First, we keep the original training and validation sets
intact and use Bayesian optimization as described above to
perform hyperparameter tuning and choose the model with
the best performance on the validation set. We note the best
hyperparameters and the number of epochs needed to train
the best model. Second, we train a fresh model on both
the validation and training sets with the hyperparameters
chosen in the first step and for the same number of epochs.
The model obtained in the second step is the final model.
Note that the first step has two purposes: (1) choosing best

concluded that the observed interaction among two feature
groups is high when the average magnitude of their secondorder interaction is also high. This implicit assumption that
neurons are activated highly when they capture a pattern to
which they are responding to is common in deep learning
and is used in other interpretation techniques, such as activation maximization [58].

Therefore, during deployment, a good strategy is to let
the model forecast only 7 days beyond the end of dates
used in training, as new features are released about every
7 days. To project further into the future, the model must be
retrained on the most recent training data available to ensure
that the knowledge it learns holds for the dates it is asked to
forecast on. It should be noted that research [12] has shown
that predictive performance of many other forecasting models also declines with time. Therefore, since the model will
only forecast 7 days into the future in practice, it is important to know its “use case accuracy” or “7-day accuracy,”
which is the model’s accuracy from June 12 through June
18 (7 days of test data). The model’s ”use case accuracy” is
much higher at 70.8%.

6. Results
6.1. Predictive Performance
In this section, we discuss the performance of the proposed model on the test set. As discussed above, the test set
contains 17 days of data from June 12 through June 28. The
average accuracy of the model on these 17 days is 63.7%
when using four output classes to categorize the growth in
the number of new cases for each county (i.e. negligible increase, moderately low increase, moderately high increase,
and significantly high increase).
Further, as shown in figure 2, the performance of the
model, which is trained from April 5 through June 11, decreases as we evaluate on dates further from June 11. The
same trend of the model performance decreasing over time
can also be observed in figures 3 and 4. This could be due
to two possible reasons. One, the COVID-19 situation is
highly dynamic and the behavior of people and the adaptive
strategies they use change frequently. For example, mask
use in the United States has increased over time, especially
after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
advised it [59]. So if the model were trained on data before mask use became prevalent, it would learn trends that
will not hold true after masks become more widespread.
Two, the testing capacity of the United States continues to
ramp up with time. As testing becomes more accessible,
the trends a model may have learned earlier may not hold,
as more people would be tested, resulting in more infected

Figure 3 shows the predictive performance of the model
in all U.S. counties on a series of dates. The figure shows
that the majority of the predicted results are consistent with
or one class away from the actual growth in the number of
cases. The predicted growth for only a few counties are
more than two or three classes away from the actual situation. This shows that the model generally performs well in
predicting growth in spread of infection in a county. Even
when the model’s predictions are incorrect, they are usually
just one category away from being correct. Further, as discussed above, the figure also shows that the accuracy of the
model decreases for dates further away from those used in
the training set.
Figure 4 shows the model predictions over time for different counties based on the growth of infected cases in
them. We see the same general trend as in figure 3 that the
model makes more inaccurate predictions as we go further
in the future.

other counties visiting the county under study. As explained
in appendix 10, these are both cross-county time-dependent
features. Together, these features could imply that the phenomenon of people traveling from more infected counties
to other counties is associated with the growth of infected
cases in the destination county. In other words, the results
show that inter-county travel risk could be high for the destination county, consistent with previous studies about the
risks of travel [60] [61]. Other important features, such as
the median home dwell time, percentage of people working full- or part-time, percentage of people staying home,
and number of people traveling to work for less than 5 minutes all show that the model has learned the importance
of staying home and social distancing in general, which is
again consistent with the reported findings in previous studies [62]. In addition, the model also shows that various
manually engineered features are effective and indicative
of the growth of infected cases. For example, COVID-19
Vulnerability Index (CCVI) score, socioeconomic vulnerability, epidemiological vulnerability, and healthcare system
factors are engineered features designed by the Surgo Foundation [63] to identify communities that are at a greater risk
of infection, and our results show that all these features are
important. Note that other features, such as estimated reproduction number (equal to the number of other infections
caused by one infected person) and population density, also
make the list of important features.

The results indicate that the feature values related to the most recent days are most important in predicting the growth of cases 7
days in the future. Refer 6.2 for more details.

6.2. Feature Importance Evaluation
In the next step, we evaluated the importance of different
county features in terms of their contribution to the prediction of the number of new cases in each county. Figure 5
shows some of the most salient features identified by the
model using the method described in section 5. As shown
in the figure 5, the most important feature is the past increase in infected cases in the current county. This implies
that the past trend of the growth of infection in a county is
a strong determinant of future growth. Moreover, the second and third most important features are the cumulative infected cases in all counties and the number of people from

Figure 6 shows the results of the time-step analysis so we
know features of which of the past days are most influential
in predicting the final output. As discussed earlier, all timedependent and cross-county time-dependent features use 13
days of past data. Since the projection interval of the model
is 7 days, the most recent day used for input features is 7
days before the prediction date (also called projected date).

6.3. Feature Interactions

Past Rise in Infected Cases

Figure 7 shows second-order interactions between all
feature groups computed by the method described in section 5. The values in the cells represent the mean activations of the second-order interactions of corresponding
feature groups. As discussed in section 5, higher values
represent higher observed interactions. An important observation from the figure is that almost all feature groups
have notable interaction with census features. This result
indicates that all other county-level features must be interpreted in the context of the population attributes of that
county. For example, two counties with different population attributes may require varying amounts of adherence to
social distancing orders to produce the same dampening effect in the growth of disease spread. Note also that figure
5, which shows important features identified by the model,
does not include many census features, indicating that census features alone do not contribute much to prediction of
the growth in future cases.
Also, the results show that many feature groups have relatively high interaction with cross-county mobility and infections. For example, a relatively high interaction exists
between cross-county mobility & infections and social distancing metrics. This result indicates that travellers from
other counties have a different kind of impact in destination
counties which have higher adherence to social distancing
than they do in destination counties with lower adherence
levels. This analysis validates our initial hypothesis that interactions among the many input feature groups are likely
to exist and aid in predicting the rise in future number of
cases in counties.

The proposed forecasting model can be effectively used
for predictive pandemic surveillance by both governments
and industries. For example, hospitals in each U.S. county
can use the model to estimate the growth in the number of
cases and determine their needs of future supplies and resources based on the projected number of infections. Similarly, schools and offices can make better plans for future
weeks to be prepared in the best way. In addition, policymakers can use this model to deploy proactive measures
instead of taking a reactive approach to dampen the spread
of the virus and possibly save lives.

7. Discussion and Concluding Remarks

The findings of feature importance evaluations can further help researchers decide which features to include in
their forecasting models. The results also open up new avenues for other researchers to do a detailed statistical analysis on how the most important features identified by our
model exactly contribute to the growth of infected cases.
Further, the proposed model can also be used to test the
effectiveness of various hand engineered features in predicting the growth of the virus. For example, our results
have shown that several manually engineered features like
COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (CCVI) is effective in predicting the spread of the virus. Similarly, newly developed
features created by other researchers can be added to our
model and the feature analysis results can be relied upon to
show relative importance of those features. Lastly, due to
the high interpretability of our feature importance results,
policymakers can design effective control strategies to prevent the growth of infection based on controlling the impor-

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model to
examine heterogeneous county-level features and to predict
growth of infected cases in the future. The proposed method
can extract embeddings from multivariate time series and
multivariate spatial time series data in a novel way by utilizing both the temporal and spatial (if available) structure
of the data. This process of extracting embeddings could be
employed by other deep learning research to process similar
type of data. Further, unlike existing models [1] [2] [3] [4]
[5] [7], the proposed model takes in a large number of input
features and learns interactions between them. The application of the model has been demonstrated in predicting the
growth in the number of new cases in U.S. counties during
the COVID-19 pandemic. The model has acceptable performance in prediction and provides highly interpretable feature analysis results that can help policymakers cope with
spread.

9. Acknowledgment

Similarly, the results of identifying pairs of features
with high second-order interactions show that interactions
among the many input features exist and are important to
explicitly account for by future researchers in their forecasting models. Further, this analysis also opens up opportunities for data scientists and statisticians to explain more
clearly the reasons for such interactions and their possible implications to epidemiologists studying the spread of
COVID-19.

In addition, we believe that data-driven models like the
DeepCOVIDNet mark the advent of an era of extensively
using deep learning for pandemic forecasting, which can
complement existing epidemiology models. Already, there
is an increasing interest in using recurrent networks to forecast the spread of COVID-19 [64] [36] [65]. To the best
of our knowledge, the proposed model is among the earliest non-recurrent and non-conventional deep learning models used for pandemic prediction, which should encourage
other researchers to develop more creative models. Finally,
this work also presents one of the first attempts to make
the results of a deep learning based COVID-19 forecasting
model interpretable to policymakers and the public.

Further improvement regarding the prediction accuracy
and interpretability of the model are important future directions for this work. For example, although we explicitly
model second order interactions between feature groups, we
still lack a good way to interpret these interactions at the individual feature level. In other words, although we may be
able to tell that there is high interaction between census features and social distancing features, we cannot tell which
exact census features interact with which exact social distancing features. A strong understanding of which individual features interact will be of great value to epidemiology
researchers and policy makers. Further, it is important to
continue to add and engineer new features for the model
and improve its predictive performance in future studies.

assess vulnerability of a county across different areas
and one assesses overall vulnerability to COVID-19 as
described in the following. All features are bounded
between 0 and 1, where 0 means least vulnerability
and 1 means greatest vulnerability. It is important to
note that these features are defined in a relative context, meaning that the value 1 is associated with the
most vulnerable county. Due to this reason, the ”feature values” actually represent vulnerability rankings
of all counties. Each of the seven features shown below is developed by combining multiple other features
as described below.

(a) Socioeconomic Vulnerability. This feature is
developed based on population below poverty
line, unemployed population, per-capita income,
and population without high school diploma and
represents the socioeconomic vulnerability of a
county.
(b) Household Composition & Disability. This
feature is developed based on the distribution
of population older than 65, population younger
than 17, population with a disability, and single
parent households. It is a measure of vulnerability of households and the population at large.
(c) Minority Status & Language. As the name suggests, this feature is developed based on minority population and number of people who speak
“less than well” English.
(d) Housing Type & Transportation. This feature is developed by using the estimate of mobile
homes, households with more people than rooms,
households with no available vehicle, housing
with structures with 10 or more units, and persons living in institutionalized group quarters.
This feature helps identify communities with
poor housing or transportation situation.
(e) Epidemiological Vulnerability This feature
identifies communities with greater risk of negative impact during disease epidemics. It is built
by using 11 other features capturing the number
of people with cardiovascular issues, respiratory
conditions, weak immune systems, obesity, diabetes, and high vulnerability to influenza and
pneumonia. The feature also considers population density of the county.
(f) Healthcare System Factors. This feature tries
to measure the capacity, strength (measured by
county spending on health and research quality)
and preparedness of the health care system in a
county using 8 different features.
(g) COVID-19 Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Finally, the above 6 features are combined with

10. Appendix: Feature Descriptions
In this section, we provide detailed descriptions of the
feature groups used in the model. As shown in section 3,
the feature groups of the model are categorized based on
four influencing factors. In this section, we provide the definition and detailed calculation of all feature groups based
on their influencing factors.

10.1. Population Attributes
As mentioned in table 2, we use the following features
to capture population attributes:
1. Census Features: We use a subset of 2100 sociodemographic features compiled by SafeGraph [67].
These features include population level information
about age/sex, race, ethnicity, commuting information,
household/family type, school enrollment, language
spoken at home, poverty status, income, employment
status and occupation. This data is originally collected
by the American Community Survey in 2016.
2. Vulnerability Features: In this group, we add population density and other features built by the Surgo
Foundation [63] to identify counties that are more vulnerable to the spread of the virus. Specifically, the
foundation has created seven features, six of which

and delay the transmission of” the virus.

cell phone data to estimate population activity in small
spatial regions of each county, to extract values of si (t)
and sj (t) for cells.

10.3. Mobility

10.2. Population Activities

To capture mobility across regions, we employed intercounty travel data from SafeGraph as described below.

We use the mobility data collected by SafeGraph to capture population activities. The SafeGraph Patterns [68] and
SafeGraph Social Distancing Metrics [69] are adopted in
our use case. The former includes information related to the
number of visits to certain points of interest, and the latter
provides data to show adherence to stay-at-home guidelines.

1. Cross County Mobility & Infections: The SafeGraph
data [68] include the census blocks where the travelers
visiting a certain point of interest come from. With this
information, we can estimate the total number of travelers from one county to another. We further augment
the mobility data by also adding the cumulative number of infections in source counties, so the model can
realize that visitors from a more infected county could
be more dangerous than visitors from a less infected
county.

1. Visitation Patterns: SafeGraph Patterns data has
information about the number of people that visit
different types of points of interest (i.e. grocery
stores, health facilities, etc) on a given day. We
consider visits to the following types of places in
our model: amusement parks and arcades, colleges/universities/professional schools, living facilities
for elderly, department stores, hospitals, merchandise stores/supercenters, grocery stores, and restaurants/eating places. As discussed in 3.1, visits to grocery stores, restaurants/other eating places, living facilities for elderly, and hospitals could be particularly
helpful in forecasting the growth of cases since these
places could facilitate virus transmission [41] [42] [43]
[44].

10.4. Disease Spread Attributes
1. Past Rise in Infected Cases: We consider the weekly
rise in the number of confirmed cases in past days as
a feature to represent the past pandemic situation in
a county. This data is obtained from the New York
Times GitHub repository [70]. Since the proposed
model predicts the growth of cases a week in the future, the weekly rise in cases for the past few days as
an input feature can inform the model about the recent
trend of the variable that it has to predict.

2. Social Distancing Metrics: We use SafeGraph social
distancing metrics to compute/extract the percentage
of people staying home, percentage of people working
full- or part-time, median distance travelled from home
and the median amount of time spent at home for each
county and each day. As discussed in 3.1, adherence
to stay-at-home guidelines and the number of people
working outside are both important in determining the
spread of the virus [45] [46] [47] [48].

2. Reproduction Number: The basic reproduction number is also used, which is an estimate of how fast the
number of cases are expected to increase by. Formally,
it is the estimated number of other cases caused by
one infected person. Fan et al. [51] describe the exact
method of estimating reproduction number by using a
simple epidemic model. They assume that an infected
person infects another R0 people after time τ . Therefore, if the number of infected people at time step 0
are i(0), then at time step t, the number will grow to
t/τ
i(0)R0 . Simple algebraic manipulations show that:

3. Venables Distance: Venables distance captures the
concentration of population activities in a county. Venables distance, DV (t), is defined formally as [31]:

R0 = e

(ln i(t)−ln i(0))·τ
t

(4)

P
DV (t) =

i<j si (t)sj (t)dij
P
i<j si (t)sj (t)

(3)

Fan et al. [51] set τ to 5.1 days and provide justifications for this choice in their work. As table 1 shows,
we use reproduction number as a time dependent feature in the model. Therefore, for this analysis, we estimate the daily reproduction number based on 10 days
of past data. In other words, to estimate R0 at day d,
we use the following formula:

where si , sj represents the population activity intensity
in cell i and j respectively and dij represents the distance between the two cells. In our analysis, we define
a cell to be a 4 km2 area. We compute DV for each
day and county by basically using the daily average
values for si (t) and sj (t). Louail et al. [31] describe
more details about this equation. We use Mapbox digital trace telmetry data, which basically uses aggregated
