Abstract
New binary classification tests are often evaluated relative to a preestablished test. For example, rapid Antigen tests for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 are assessed relative to more established PCR tests. In this
paper, I argue that the new test can be described as producing ambiguous
information when the pre-established is imperfect. This allows for a phenomenon called dilation—an extreme form of non-informativeness. As an
example, I present hypothetical test data satisfying the WHO’s minimum
quality requirement for rapid Antigen tests which leads to dilation. The
ambiguity in the information arises from a missing data problem due to imperfection of the established test: the joint distribution of true infection and
test results is not observed. Using results from Copula theory, I construct
the (usually non-singleton) set of all these possible joint distributions, which
allows me to assess the new test’s informativeness. This analysis leads to
a simple sufficient condition to make sure that a new test is not a dilation.
I illustrate my approach with applications to data from three COVID-19
related tests. Two rapid Antigen tests satisfy my sufficient condition easily
and are therefore informative. However, less accurate procedures, like chest
CT scans, may exhibit dilation.

Introduction

An important aspect of evaluating a new diagnostic test is to assess its accuracy.
Intuitively, a sensible binary test should have test results highly correlated with the
underlying health condition. In other words, a positive test result should be likely
if and only the tested person is indeed infected or sick.1 However, establishing
whether a person is truly infected is often costly or even impossible. Therefore,
a new test is analyzed relative to an established test. An established test is
perfect when a positive test result occurs if and only if the person is truly infected.
The medical literature calls these perfect tests a “gold standard” (Watson et al.,
2020). In these situations the joint distribution of the new test’s outcomes and
the underlying true health condition is the same as the joint distribution of test
results from both tests. Thus, this observed joint distribution can be used to
evaluate the new test’s accuracy.
In practice, however, a perfect reference test does not exist. In such a case,
the researcher would need the joint distribution of the health conditions and the
outcomes of both tests.2 This overall joint distribution is not observable (or maybe
only if the researcher incurs a high costs for obtaining the data). This missing
data problem leads to two distinct problems: (i) the marginal distribution of the
underlying health condition is missing and (ii) the correlation between new test’s
outcome and health status is missing too.3 The latter of these problems will
introduce ambiguity in the information provided by the new test.
The first of these problems, missing data about the underlying health condition,
is well-known. Recently, Manski and Molinari (2021) use methods known from the
literature on partial identification to provide bounds on prevalence—the fraction
of infected people in the population.4 Measuring prevalence is different from the
usual inference problem because the tested population might not be representative
of the overall population. Here the data are observed selectively which corresponds
to a selection problem as introduced by Manski (1989). Furthermore, Manski
(2020) illustrates how this problem carries over to evaluating accuracy of new
tests in the context of COVID-19 Antibody tests maintaining the assumption of
a perfect reference test.
1

In the following, I will not differentiate between being infected and being sick.
Depending on the question, it might suffice to consider the joint distribution of the new test’s
outcomes and the underlying true health condition. For example, the analysis Subsection 2.2
requires only this bivariate joint distribution. The trivariate distribution is needed to evaluate
the informativeness of performing both tests as discussed in Subsection 2.3.
3
In the introduction, I use the word correlation loosely and informal.
4
Similar approaches were used by Stoye (2020) and Sacks et al. (2020).

Introduction
The second problem of missing data about the correlation is different in nature

and avoided when a perfect reference is available. Even if one would assume
knowledge of prevalence, potentially multiple ’correlation structures’ are consistent
with the observed data. The reason for this multiplicity is well-known from copulas
as studied in probability theory. Knowledge of prevalence provides the marginal
distribution of the health condition, whereas the observed testing data provides (a
bivariate) marginal distribution. In general, there are multiple (trivariate) joint
distributions with these marginal distributions. Due to this multiplicity a simple,
unambiguous interpretation of the new test is not possible. Without knowledge
of prevalence, the problem identified before carries over and therefore exacerbates
the overall multiplicity. However, as discussed in more detail later, the ambiguous
information stems only from the missing data on correlation and therefore occurs
whether or not the researcher has knowledge about prevalence.
In this paper, I provide a theoretic framework that combines insights from
Manski and Molinari (2021) and Stoye (2020) about selective testing with the
missing correlation data due to an imperfect reference test. Within this framework,
it is possible to address informativeness of both tests. First, Proposition 1 shows
that the established test’s negative predictive value5 is usually not given by a
unique number, but it always informative nevertheless. This multiplicity arises
because of problem (i) only. Then, I analyze the new test’s informativeness for
the test population only. The focus on the tested population simplifies the algebra
and furthermore shuts down the ambiguity about prevalence (cf. problem (i))
and therefore allows me to study the essence of ambiguous information for the
new test in separation (problem (ii) only). Finally, I study the implications on
informativeness if both effects are present.
Studying the informativeness of tests has a long tradition in probability theory,
statistics, economics, and philosophy. Blackwell (1951, 1953) introduces a notion
of “(more) informative” for (what is now called Blackwell) experiments.6 An
experiment is a mapping from states of the world to a distribution over signals.
In the current setting, an experiment is a function that associates a distribution
over test results to each of the possible health conditions, i.e. for being infected
and for being healthy. In such a setting, the value of information is defined as the
amount a Bayesian decision maker is willing to pay for the experiment. Since every
5

A test’s negative predictive values is the probability of being healthy conditional on obtaining
a negative test result. Another important informativeness measure is the positive predictive
value, which is the probability of being infected conditional on a positive test result. I will
assume throughout that the established has a perfect predictive value in line with the application
to SARS-CoV-2 testing.

de Oliveira (2018) provides a more recent treatment.

experiment is more informative than an uninformative experiment,7 Blackwell’s
theorem shows that the value of information is (weakly) positive for every Bayesian
decision maker.8 Ideally a diagnostic test should satisfy Blackwell’s definition of
an experiment in order to ensure that it is always informative. However, this is
typically only true for the established test in my framework.
The new test fails to be a Blackwell experiment because it does not map each
state to a unique distribution over test results. Rather, due to the multiplicity of
joint distributions, there is a set of distributions over test results for a given health
condition.9 Therefore, Blackwell’s informativeness notion does not apply to the
new test. Furthermore, the value of information needs to be adjusted because a
Bayesian analysis does not readily apply with sets of probabilities. Such a situation
is usually referred to as a situation of “ambiguity” and the literature has identified
several extensions of Bayesian decision making to the realm of ambiguity.10
Instead of defining the value of information for a specific decision criterion in
such a situation, I adopt a very weak notion of informativeness: the diagnostic test
is informative if and only if it is not a dilation. Seidenfeld and Wasserman (1993)
introduce the notation of dilation for situations with sets of probabilities. In the
current context, a dilation occurs if, no matter what test result is obtained, the set
of probabilities conditional on this information contains the original set of probabilities. Figure 1 illustrates an example of a dilation. Here, the set of probabilities
indicating the infection likelihood before the test (black set) lies within both sets
after the test result (blue for a positive result and red indicating the set after a
negative result). Thus, in a sense, the decision maker is worse-off after taking the
test than before taking the test no matter what the test result is. For this reason,
Seidenfeld and Wasserman call a dilation a “counterintuitive phenomenon” and
Gul and Pesendorfer (2018) refer to it as “all news is bad news”.
My framework allows to fully characterize when a new diagnostic test is a
dilation (cf. Expression (3)). Since the definition of informativeness for tests is
rather weak, any reasonable test should satisfy this criterion. The characterization
provides a method to verify whether the new test is informative.
7

An experiment is uninformative if the mapping mentioned above is a constant function?
More generally, Blackwell characterizes his notion of “more informative” with the requirement that every Bayesian decision maker has a higher value of information for the more informative experiment.
9
Formally, the new test can be seen a correspondence or set-valued function.

Machina and Siniscalchi (2014) provide a recent overview about this topic.

The WHO (2020) recommends a minimum standard of accuracy for rapid
Antigen tests.11 Usually a PCR test is the established test used to evaluate these
Antigen tests (Esbin et al., 2020). Table 1 illustrates hypothetical test data, which
fulfill the minimal requirements of the WHO. However, as the analysis will reveal,
this test is actually a dilation and therefore not informative.12

For minimum

required accuracy standards, the dilation characterization provides an easy to
verify sufficient condition to avoid dilation. The new test is informative (in the
population of tested people) if
Fraction of people with a positive new test
≤
minimum sensitivity of new test × sensitivity of established test.
11

For the informed reader, the WHO recommends a sensitivity of at least 80% and a specificity
of at least 97%. These measures will be formally introduced and defined later.
12
This statement depends on the accuracy of the established PCR test. A dilation occurs only
if the PCR has sensitivity at the lower range identified by the literature.

5
Besides theoretic applications of dilation, there is not much empirical evidence
in the literature yet. Recently, economists started to investigate dilation and
ambiguous information experimentally. The only experiment focusing on how
decision makers react to dilation and relate the behavior to the value of information
is conduced by Shishkin and Ortoleva (2020). To the best of my knowledge, the
possible occurrence of dilation with diagnostic tests (or SARS-CoV-2 tests more
specifically) is the first observation of this phenomenon ‘in the field.’13
Of course, researchers studying diagnostic tests are well aware of the general
issues addressed here. The problem of selection leading to unobserved prevalence
is known as Verification Bias, whereas the problem arising from unobserved correlation due to an imperfect reference test is descriptively named Imperfect Gold
Standard Bias. (Zhou et al., 2014, Chapters 10–11) This paper is not the first to
document that either of of these problem leads to non-identified models; rather
the novelty of this paper comes in the approach. Diagnostic test research seeks
to avoid non-identified models by introducing additional assumptions and then
address resulting biases relative to a baseline assumption. Proposed methods include simply imputing missing data or considering more sophisticated correction
methods. Moreover, the two problems are often addressed separately. By contrast, my framework requires minimal assumptions and addresses both problems
simultaneously.14

Main Analysis

I consider the following situation. Let x = 1 denote that a person is infected and
x = 0 if the person is healthy. Initially, there is binary test available where y = 1
indicates a positive test result and y = 0 a negative result. Finally, a new test is
introduced which again can be either positive (z = 1) or negative (z = 0).
Let P (x, y, z) denote the population distribution under consideration with p :=
P (x = 1) denoting prevalence. However, the population distribution is not directly
observable. This is, of course, almost always the case, because a researcher usually
only observes a sample from the population distribution. This leads to the usual
inference problem. Throughout, I will abstract away from inference altogether.
Instead, the data is given for people who were tested to obtain data on the new
13

Manski (2018) mentions that a dilation might occur in a different medical context, but does
not address this issue further.

Reitsma et al. (2009) provide a flowchart as guidance for applied researchers to address several problems arising when establishing accuracy of diagnostic tests. The two problems addressed
here are in two distinct branches of the flowchart.

test. For this denote tested people with t = 1 and t = 0 otherwise. Then, the
data are given by P (y, z|t = 1) and I assume that P (t = 1) > 0.15,16
Furthermore, since the established test is well-known, precise information about
the sensitivity and specificity of this test is available as well. The following assumption ensures that both of these measures are well defined.
Assumption 1 (Non-trivial prevalence). The population satisfies p ∈ (0, 1).
With this assumption, sensitivity and specificity for the initial test are respectively defined as:
P (x = 1, y = 1)
=: σ, and

P (x = 0, y = 0)
P (y = 0|x = 0) =

(2)

As discussed in Manski (2020), for decision making sensitivity and specificity
are not the relevant measures. The relevant measures are positive predictive value
(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). For the established test these measures can be obtained from specificity and sensitivity via Bayes’ rule if prevalence
p and P (y = 1) are known:

P (y = 0)
PPVy := P (x = 1|y = 1) =

Since the tested people are usually not representative of the overall population,17
even for the established test these two measures are not point-identified. (Manski and Molinari,
2021; Manski, 2020; Stoye, 2020)
To simplify the analysis and in-line with the application to SARS-CoV-2 testing, I also consider the following three baseline assumptions.
Assumption 2 (No False-Positives for established test). The population satisfies
P (x = 0, y = 1) = 0.
15

Furthermore, the following logical implications of (not) being tested hold: (i) t = 0 =⇒
z = 0 and (ii) z = 1 =⇒ t = 1. Note that y = 1 is possible even if not tested, because the
participation pool concerns only the new test.
16
Equivalently, the data is given by sensitivity and specificity of the new test relative to the
established test with the additional information about how many established or new tests had
a positive result.
17
For example, supposedly infected people may be oversampled in order to get meaningful
results.

7
Assumption 2 implies that the established test achieves a maximum specificity
and PPVy of 1.18
Additionally, I will assume test-monotonicity as in Manski and Molinari (2021),
meaning conditional on being tested the probability of being infected is greater
than if not being tested.19
Assumption 3 (Test-monotonicity). The population satisfies P (x = 1|t = 1) ≥
P (x = 1|t = 0).
Lastly, I assume that the established test’s sensitivity does depend on the
underlying health status x, but not on whether the person is in the testing pool
t = 1.20
Assumption 4 (Health-sufficiency). The population satisfies P (y = 1|x = 1, t =
1) = P (y = 1|x = 1) = σ.
To reduce cumbersome lengthy notation in the following, I will use this simplified notation henceforth:
γ := P (y = 1|t = 1)

. . . test yield for established test

ζ := P (z = 1|t = 1)

. . . test yield for new test

τ := P (t = 1)

. . . measure of data representativeness.

To avoid trivial cases, assume that γ, ζ, τ > 0. Note that τ has a slightly different
interpretation as in Manski and Molinari (2021) or Stoye (2020). Here, τ = 1
means the data P (y, z|t = 1) is perfectly representative of the overall population.
In particular, such a parameter value implies no oversampling of infected participants.21 In particular, even if the participation pool is small (as is often the case),
this does not mean that τ should be close to zero.22
With this notation, we have P (z = 1) = τ ζ since the new test is positive only if
the person was tested. Furthermore, Assumption 2 combined with Assumption 4
18

This holds because P (x = 0, y = 0) = P (x = 0, y = 0) + P (x = 0, y = 1) = P (x = 0) = 1 − p
and P (x = 1, y = 1) = P (x = 1, y = 1) + P (x = 0, y = 1) = P (y = 1).
19
This might not be true, if there is voluntary enrollment into the testing pool. However,
for establishing the accuracy of new tests this assumptions seems to be applicable often. See
Footnote 17.
20
Recall that the testing pool is obtained for the new test. This assumption might be violated,
if, for example, the medical staff performing the established test for the testing pool is extra
careful. In this case, the established test might be more sensitive for the testing pool.
21
See Footnote 17 for why such an assumption might be problematic.
22
A small participation pool might worsen the statistical inference problem: suppose the
participation pool is perfectly representative but small. In this case τ = 1, but inference usually
relies on some sort of central limit theorem which would not be appropriate in this scenario.
However, recall that I abstract away from inference problems as mentioned above.

In turn, bounds on the established test’s overall positivity rate are implied by
sensitivity σ and Assumption 2: P (y = 1) = pσ ∈ [τ γ, γ].
Since we consider the non-trivial case of p ∈ (0, 1), consistency of the data
with the maintained assumptions requires the established test’s sensitivity to be
sufficiency high , i.e. γ < σ ≤ 1. In turn, the assumptions imply P (y = 1) ∈ (0, 1).
2.1

The established test

Assumption 2 implies a perfect positive predictive value for the established test
(PPVy = 1). However, the negative predictive value is only partially identified
and Proposition 1 provides sharp bounds.
Proposition 1. Under Assumption 1–Assumption 4, the established test’s negative predictive value is sharply bounded as follows:

Proof. Fix α = P (y = 1) ∈ [τ γ, γ] and define prevalence as a function of α by

Since σ − α ≤ 1 − α for all α ∈ [τ γ, γ], NP Vy (·) is decreasing. Therefore, NPVy ∈
[NPVy (γ), NPVy (τ γ)].



With this in hand, the established test’s informativeness can be analyzed.
Table 2 summarizes the prevalence before and after observing a test result from the
established test, which are the relevant measures for defining informativeness (cf.
Figure 1). Formally, the established test is a dilation if every possible prevalence
p ∈ [χ, χ] is a possible value of both P (x = 1|y = 1) = PPVy and P (x = 1|y =

A bound for a given set is called sharp if the bound itself is a member of this set.

0) = 1 − NPVy . Obviously, a positive test result gives perfect knowledge due to
the maintained assumptions. Thus, the established test cannot be a dilation. On
the other hand, a negative result lowers the lower and upper bound of prevalence
conditional on a negative result because τ γ ≤ γ < σ.24 Furthermore, the interval
width for any test result shrinks the set of possible values for prevalence conditional
on either test result.25 In this sense, the established test is not just informative (i.e.
not a dilation), but also strictly shrinks the size of the set of possible prevalence
values after a negative test result.

Remark: The second row corresponds to PPVy and the third row is given by 1 − NPVy .

It is well known that knowledge of prevalence is needed in order to apply Bayes’
rule to obtain NPV. Since in most applications prevalence is not known, a common practice is to assume a given prevalence level. For example the United States
Food and Drug Administration (FDA, 2020b) assumes a prevalence of 5% to calculate PPV and NPV. If such an assumption (p = χ) is added to the maintained
assumptions, then P (y = 1) = χσ and furthermore P (y = 1|t = 0) =

χσ−γτ 26
.
1−τ

This additional assumption allows to exactly pin down the established test’s NPV
as

1−χ
1−χσ

1−σ
and therefore P (x = 1|y = 0) = χ 1−χσ
. Thus, this additional assumption

not only assumes away the ambiguity about prevalence, but also illustrates that
the established test does not provide ambiguous information itself.27 The apparent ambiguity reflected in the non-trivial interval for values of prevalence after a
negative test result (cf. Table 2) or NPV (cf. Proposition 1) is only a manifestation
of the ambiguity about prevalence, but it is not due to the test itself.
24

Of course, this has to hold since the Law of Total Probability holds pointwise.
It is obvious for a positive test result. For a negative result, note that the width strictly
increases if and only if 1 − σ > (1 − γ)(1 − τ γ), which is equivalent to τ (1 + γ) > σγ + 1 ≥ 2
leading to a contradiction.
26
Alternatively, one could drop the assumption that P (t = 1) = τ is known exactly. In this
case (and allowing P (y = 1|t =h0) ∈ [0,
i γ] as in the general case) the assumed prevalence bounds
25

τ . Calculations show that τ ∈ 0, χσ
γ . Since the lower bound is always τmin = 0, we do not find
this case very interesting.
27
Technically, the established test is an experiment á la Blackwell (1951), where sensitivity
and specificity can be seen as functions mapping (health) states to distributions over signals (i.e.
test results). As mentioned in the introduction, this implies that the established test’s value of
information is (weakly) positive under these assumptions.

10

The new test

The new test

Next, the new test’s informativeness is analyzed. First, I will discuss informativeness only based on the tested population. For this subpopulation the prevalence is given by χ = γ/σ and therefore the ambiguity about prevalence is muted.
Subsection 2.4 extends the analysis then to the informativeness of the new test for
the overall population. For the test population, the relevant measures are again
positive-predictive value (PPV) and negative-predicative value (NPV), but now
they are also conditional on being tested:
P (x = 1, z = 1|t = 1)
P (x = 1, z = 1|t = 1)
=
P (z = 1|t = 1)
ζ
P (x = 0, z = 0|t = 1)
P (x = 0, z = 0|t = 1)
=
.
NPVz := P (x = 0|z = 0, t = 1) =
P (z = 0|t = 1)
1−ζ
PPVz := P (x = 1|z = 1, t = 1) =

To obtain these measures, the distribution P (x, z|t = 1) is needed. For a fixed τ , I
use a result from Joe (1997) that provides the set of all possible joint distributions
P (x, y, z) compatible with the data P (x, y|t = 1) (cf. Appendix A). Setting τ =
1 in this construction gives the possible distributions P (x, y, z|t = 1). Finally,
P (x, z|t = 1) is obtained by marginalization.
To simplify the algebraic expressions it will be useful to differentiate between
four cases defined in Table 3. Fixing the established test’s sensitivity σ, the test
data P (x, y|t = 1) immediately reveals the case the test belongs to. Figure 2
illustrates this for three real tests considered later (StQ, BiN, CT) and three
hypothetical tests (including the dilation test from Table 1). When σ → 1, then
all but the informative case (I) cease to be relevant. For SARS-CoV-2 detecting
Antigen test the WHO recommends a minimum specificity close to one. Tests
close to the (top-right) frontier in Figure 2 satisfy this criterion.28 Thus, for most
applications, either the confirmatory (if σ < 1) or the informative case (if σ ≈ 1)
will be the relevant ones.
In contrast to the established test, the new test’s PPV could be less than one
and is, in general, only set-identified. The reason for set-identification is that
P (x, z|t = 1) is not directly observed. As explained above, there are multiple
distributions P (x, z|t = 1) consistent with the data and each distribution leads to
a potentially different PPV. Proposition 2 establishes the sharp identified set for
values of PPV.
28
CT, Uni, and Anti do not satisfy the WHO minimum requirement of a 97% minimum
specificity.

Proof. Conditional on t = 1 is the same as if τ = 1. Thus, From Table 20 and
Table 21, we obtain respectively:29

P (x = 1, z = 1|t = 1) := P (y = 1, z = 1|t = 1) + max

Now, note that χ − γ = χ(1 − σ) and divide by ζ to obtain PPV.

To avoid partially identified predictive values, these measures for the new tests
are often reported as if the reference test is perfect. In this case, the data P (y, z)
alone delivers a unique predictive value:
Corollary 1 (Perfect Gold Standard - PPV). Suppose Assumption 1, Assumption 2,
and Assumption 4 hold. If σ = 1, i.e. the established test has perfect sensitivity,
then P P Vz = P (y = 1|z = 1, t = 1).
Proof. If σ = 1, then χ = γ = P (y = 1|t = 1). Thus, the relevant case is (I).30
Therefore the lower bound is P (y = 1|z = 1, t = 1) and the upper bound is

We saw before that the established test always achieves a maximal PPV of

one and therefore provides a lot of information in case it delivers a positive result.
How informative is a positive result of the new test? To answer this question,
note that since we condition on being tested, there is no prior uncertainty as the
prevalence in the testing pool is given by χ. Even without this prior ambiguity
there remains ambiguity in the test result. For example, in the confirmatory case
(C) the interval’s width of possible values for PPVz is 1 − P (y = 1|z = 1, t = 1),
which is usually small—but non-zero—in applications. Thus, the information
obtained from a new test is ambiguous at least after a positive test result.31

Here and in the following I will use P to denote lower bound distributions and P for upper
bounds.
30
Technically, one could be on the border of case (C) or (U), but by continuity the resulting
bounds do not change.
31
This observation alone implies the test is not an experiment à la Blackwell (1951). Similarly
to deriving PPV, it is possible to derive the new test’s sensitivity. This will be a set in general

13
In contrast to the established test as discussed in Subsection 2.1, the ambiguity
arising from the new test allows for the occurrence of dilation. In the current
setting a dilation occurs if χ = P (x = 1|t = 1) is contained in the intersection
of the two sets with possible values for P (x = 1|y = i, t = 1) for each test result
i ∈ {0, 1}. Is it possible that after a positive test result the set of possible values
for P (x = 1|y = 1, t = 1) contain χ = P (x = 1|t = 1)? Corollary 2 provides a
full characterization. The corresponding case after a negative test result will be
discussed afterwards.

and Assumption 4 hold. The new test’s possible values for PPV contain χ =

The inequality of Corollary 2 becomes non-trivial in case the testing data does
not correspond to an independent distribution, which will be the case for most
applications. In these cases, a dilation cannot occur when the non-trivial inequality
of Corollary 2 is violated.
It remains to analyze the information contained in a negative test result.
Proposition 3 establishes sharp bounds for the negative predictive value of the
too. Thus, there is a correspondence from (health) states to distributions over signals (test
results).

Division by P (z = 0|t = 1) = 1 − ζ gives NPV.



The uninformative (U) and contradictory (X) case seem problematic in light
of Proposition 3. In both cases, the lower bound is zero and also the width of the
interval is rather large. This is another indication that any reasonable test should
not fall in either of these two cases. However, even for the other cases—and like for
PPV—the NPV is generally only set-identified. Therefore a negative test result
also produces ambiguous information.
Avoiding this ambiguity can be achieved with a perfect reference test. Corollary 3
verifies that if the reference test is perfect, Proposition 3 reduces to the expression
used in many applications and can be calculated directly from the data P (y, z).
Corollary 3 (Perfect Gold Standard - NPV). Suppose Assumption 1, Assumption 2,

If there is no perfect reference test available, the negative new test’s result

where the first entry corresponds to an increase in the upper bound, and the second
condition ensures the lower bound decreases.
Proof. For the upper bound (of 1 − NPVz ) a strict decrease can only happen in
cases (C) and (I), i.e. P (y = 0, z = 0|t = 1) ≥ χ(1 − σ). In these cases, a strict
decrease is equivalent to (1 − ζ) − [P (y = 0, z = 0|t = 1) − χ(1 − σ)] < χ(1 − ζ)
or 1 − ζ + χ(ζ − σ) < P (y = 0, z = 0|t = 1) = 1 − ζ − P (y = 1, z = 0|t = 1).

As in the proof of Corollary 2 the condition for being in case (C) or (I) is implied
by this condition.
For the lower bound, a decrease occurs if
χ(1 − ζ) ≥
(1 − ζ) − min {1 − χ, P (y = 0, z = 0|t = 1)} = max {χ − ζ, P (y = 1, z = 0|t = 1)} .
First, χ − ζ ≤ χ(1 − ζ) always holds as χ ≤ 1. Second, rearranging P (y = 1, z =
0|t = 1) ≤ (1 − ζ) σγ provides the condition.

Corollary 2 combined with Corollary 4 provides an exact characterization for
when the new test is a dilation. In fact, as the conditions are the same a dilation
occurs if and only if

2.2

The new test

When evaluating a new test’s accuracy it is important to make sure the data
violates Expression (3). Otherwise, the test is uninformative in an extreme sense.
In typical applications, the data often satisfies P (y = 1, z = 0|t = 1) ≤ γ(1 − ζ).32
test In these cases, a dilation can only occur if σ ≤

γζ
.
P (y=1,z=1|t=1)

The WHO (2020) recommends minimum quality requirements using only information directly provided by the data P (y, z|t = 1). In light of this analysis, an
evaluation should also take σ, the established test’s sensitivity, into account and
with this also make sure that the test is not a dilation. σ ≤

γζ
P (y=1,z=1|t=1)

combined

with a given minimum standard provides an easy-to-verify sufficient condition to
avoid dilation.
For this, let Σ be a minimum (apparent) sensitivity threshold below which a
test is deemed not reliable and denote the new test’s apparent sensitivity with
Σ = P (z = 1|y = 1, t = 1), so that a test is reliable if Σ > Σ.33 Then, the
application relevant case from Expression (3) to avoid a dilation can be expressed
as σ > ζ/Σ or equivalently as Σ > ζ/σ. If Σ ≥ ζ/σ, then any test meeting the
minimum requirement cannot be a dilation. Thus, it suffices to make sure the new
test’s yield is not too high:34
ζ := P (z = 1|t = 1) ≤ σ × Σ.

(4)

If the established test is highly specific, i.e. σ ≈ 1, then Expression (4) is satisfied
unless the new test’s yield is extremely high.
For SARS-CoV-2 Antigen tests the WHO recommendation is Σ = 0.8 and if
the PCR test is not highly specific then Expression (4) might be violated. For
example, the dilation test of Table 1 has ζ = 0.49 and if the PCR has sensitivity
of σ = 0.6 then not only Expression (4) is violated but the test is a dilation. More
specifically, Expression (3) can be used to find the exact threshold sensitivity σ ∗
below which a given test turns into a dilation. For the dilation test this value is
σ ∗ = 60.79%.
32

Even data that regards a test as inadequate as in Cassaniti et al. (2020) satisfies this inequality. I thank Filip Obradovic for making me aware of this report.
33
Usually, the minimum requirements include also a threshold for specificity, but this does not
matter here.

It is worth recalling that this is a sufficient condition when, additionally, P (y=1,z=1|t=1)

2.3

Informativeness of Additional Testing

Whereas the new test produces ambiguous information, the established test is
always informative. Therefore, practitioners might want to perform an additional
established test depending on whether a person obtains a negative or positive
result from the new test. For example, if an Antigen test is used to detect SARSCoV-2 and the result is positive, a common practice is verifying the result by
means of a PCR test. Since PCR tests are the reference test for evaluating the
accuracy of Antigen tests, the current framework can be used to shed light on how
informative this additional test is.
Proposition 4 (Combined testing). Under Assumption 1, Assumption 2, and
Assumption 4,
P (x = 1|y = 1, z = 1, t = 1) = P (x = 1|y = 1, z = 0, t = 1) = 1,

P (x = 0, y = 0, z = 0|t = 1) = max {0, γ − χ + P (y = 0, z = 0|t = 1)}
= max {0, P (y = 0, z = 0|t = 1) − χ(1 − σ)}
and
P (x = 0, y = 0, z = 0|t = 1) = min {1 − χ, P (y = 0, z = 0|t = 1)} .

Predictive values for the overall population

Note that P (x = 0, y = 0, z = 1|t = 1) ≥ P (x = 0, y = 0, z = 1|t = 1) in this case.
Division by P (y = 0, z = 1|t = 1) gives P (x = 0|y = 0, z = 1, t = 1).



Proposition 4 once more reveals that tests in the category (U) and (X) should
be avoided. Even if the two test results match and are both negative, the possibility of zero (negative) predictive value cannot be ruled out. Proposition 4 also
makes clear the naming convention of the cases defined in Table 3. A confirmatory
test (C) provides accurate information when both test produce a negative result,
but is completely uninformative if and only if the new test has a positive result.
An informative test (I), however, always provides some information in the sense
of producing not completely trivial bounds. A contradictory test (X) provides information, but leans against the result of the established test. The uninformative
test (U) provides no information at all even when both tests agree on a negative
result. Of course, performing the additional test is always informative in the sense
of not being a dilation. The established test does not produce false-negatives and
therefore a positive result from the established test is always a perfect predictor
of being infected regardless of the new test.
2.4

Predictive values for the overall population

Proposition 1 bounds the established test’s NPV for the overall population, not
only for the tested population. The new test, on the other hand, was analyzed
for the testing pool only so far. The full characterization in Appendix A allows to
extend the analysis of the new test to make an evaluation for the overall population. Since this involves more cumbersome notation, I only illustrate the resulting
bounds for the NPV = P (x = 0|z = 0). The analysis of PPV would proceed in a
similar matter.

P (x = 0, z = 0) = 1 − τ max {χ, 1 − P (y = 0, z = 0|t = 1)}
= 1 − τ max {χ, ζ + P (y = 1, z = 0|t = 1)} .
Now, the result follows from dividing by P (z = 0) = 1 − τ ζ.



If instead of predictive values the interest lies in the new test’s sensitivity or
specificity in the whole population another complication arises. Conditional on
the testing pool, both of these measures can be derived as in Subsection 2.2. For
example, for sensitivity one could use the proof of Proposition 2 and divide by
P (x = 1|t = 1) = χ instead of P (z = 1|t = 1) = ζ. The bounds for sensitivity are
again determined by considering the extremes of Table 20 and Table 21. For the
unconditional sensitivity, however, the the numerator and the denominator are
both set identified because P (x = 1) ∈ [χ, χ]. Therefore, the lower bound might
not be attained at either of the extreme distributions. This makes solving for
a closed-form expression for sensitivity intractable. Nonetheless, the bounds can
easily be obtained computationally by considering a fixed Γ := P (y = 1) ∈ [τ γ, γ]

20

Applications

with corresponding p = Γ/σ. For this Γ, sharp bounds of sensitivity, say [LΓ , HΓ],
can be obtained by using Table 18 and Table 19. To find the overall bounds for
sensitivity, two (non-linear) optimization problems across all values of Γ need to
be performed to give [minΓ LΓ , maxΓ HΓ ].

Applications

In this section, the theoretic framework will be illustrated with several applications. First, I analyze the (hypothetical) dilation test presented in the introduction. Then, I examine two real SARS-CoV-2 detecting tests. Finally, I show that
CT-scanning procedures to detect COVID-19 are prone to being dilations.
3.1

A Dilation Test

As argued before the hypothetical test data in Table 1 corresponds to a dilation.
Suppose the test data is derived for an Antigen test to detect SARS-CoV-2 and
the reference test is a PCR test.35 . The test satisfies the WHO’s (2020) minimum
requirements with apparent sensitivity (Σ = 80.6%) and specificity (97.1%) above
the specified thresholds of 80% and 97%, respectively.36 For such a setting the
current framework is applicable. Especially, Assumption 2 seems to be warranted
because a PCR test is highly specific. However, it is known that a PCR test might
lack high sensitivity. Alcoba-Florez et al. (2020) report sensitivity for several PCR
tests with point estimates ranging from σ = 60.2% to σ = 97.9%.37 All of the
95% confidence intervals exclude perfect sensitivity, σ = 1.
Using the results from Subsection 2.2, Table 4 summarizes some key statistics
for the dilation test. When the PCR sensitivity is close to one, the new (hypothetical) test produces relative accurate measurements with PPV close to one and NPV
above 75%. However, if the PCR test lacks high sensitivity then we cannot be sure
of the dilation test’s quality. In the worst-case for PCR sensitivity (σ = 0.6), the
new test is indeed a dilation: Before a test result was obtained the prevalence (in
the testing pool) is 98.8%, after obtaining either dilation test’s result the possible
probability of being infected is at least the interval [97.7%, 100%]. In fact, potentially even more puzzling is that the lowest value after a negative test is strictly
35

Recall that for SARS-CoV-2 detection a PCR test is the established test used to evaluate
other tests. (Esbin et al., 2020)
36
These numbers are calculated as if the reference test is perfect. This is similar to Corollary 1
and Corollary 3.

Alcoba-Florez et al. differentiate values based on the targeted gene. The range reported

Corollary 1 and Corollary 3 which yields 99.42% and 94.13%, respectively. These
are the reported values of Kaiser et al. (2020). However, as explained above PCR
are not perfectly sensitive.38 Thus, to evaluate the StQ test the current framework
is applicable.
Focusing first on the testing pool only, Table 6 summarizes PPV and NPV
for different values of PCR sensitivity (σ) using Proposition 2 and Proposition 3.
Even if the PCR test lacks high sensitivity, StQ has a close to perfect positive
predicative value (PPVz ≈ 1). However, the values for NPV drop significantly
as σ decreases. In the worst case, a negative StQ result becomes close to a fair
coin flip. However, the test is very informative overall as can be seen by the low
dilation threshold σ ∗ = 36.3%.
38

Kaiser et al. (2020) use PCR tests targeting E genes, which tend to have higher sensitivity
in the analysis of Alcoba-Florez et al. (2020). The lowest reported sensitivity for a PCR test
targeting E genes is 65.33%.

Kaiser et al. (2020, p. 1) state “study participants were representative of the
usual population seeking testing in our center (main testing center in Geneva).
The majority were presenting with symptoms compatible with a SARS-CoV2 infection and a minority were asymptomatic but with a known positive contact or
were asymptomatic healthcare workers.” The current framework allows to use
the obtained testing data to evaluate StQ’s quality for the overall population (of
Geneva) as analyzed in Subsection 2.4. Furthermore, this explanation supports
Assumption 3.
Table 7 shows bounds on prevalence using the baseline analysis in Section 2.
For low values of τ , i.e. the testing pool was highly non-representative of the
overall population, the width of the intervals is rather wide. However, even the
lowest number is close to 2% indicating a thorough spread of the virus in Geneva at
the time of testing.39 When testing becomes representative (τ → 1) the prevalence
converges to the prevalence in the testing pool.

At this time, if a Genevese obtains a negative PCR result, what is the probability of her being infected? If testing is not competently representative, a unique
number cannot be given. However, Proposition 1 provides sharp bounds for this
case and the results are shown in Table 8. How do these PCR results compare to
results from StQ? Table 9 provides the numbers using Proposition 5. The lower
bounds are significantly lower than for the PCR test. This makes the width of the
interval also significantly wider. The widening is a reflection of the combination of

Note that this is a one time analysis. It does not answer the question of how many people
were cumulatively infected by SARS-CoV-2 up to the time of testing.

BiaxNOW Covid-19 Ag Home Test

The BiaxNOW (BiN ) Covid-19 Ag Home Test of Abbott is one of the first rapid
Antigen tests for use at home which is able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus that
was emergency approved by the FDA (2020a). BiN’s clinical performance for
approval by the FDA was conducted with a PCR test as a reference. The data
are shown in Table 10 and Table 11 shows the implied accuracy measures.

Relative to StQ, BiN has significantly lower PPV and also rules out perfect
PPV for lower values of PCR specificity. On the other hand, NPV is uniformly
greater for BiN compared to StQ. Even for the worst-case PCR sensitivity, BiN’s
possible NPV values are reasonably high. Furthermore, the dilation threshold is
extremely low at σ ∗ = 26.7%.

is additional data a PCR test produces, which can be used to refine bounds on
predictive values of the Antigen test. However, an extension of the current setting
is needed, because such additional information is not accounted for in the current
setting with binary tests. Subsection 4.2 discusses a possible extension of the
current setting to allow for this additional data.

CT scan to detect COVID-19

Ai et al. (2020) and Gietema et al. (2020) propose using chest CT scans for early
identifying COVID-19 in patients. In Gietema et al.’s study, all COVID-19 symptomatic patients of a single Dutch emergency department have a chest CT scan
and a PCR test for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Their study design exactly fits the
framework of the current paper: (i) non-representative sampling of the testing
pool and (ii) missing correlation data due to use of an imperfect reference test
(with perfect specificity). The testing data are reproduced in Table 13. Compared
to the previously studies Antigen tests, the data for CT scans seems less aligned
with the PCR test results. This is an indication that such a CT test is less informative: the dilation threshold of σ ∗ = 63.35% is higher than for the Antigen
40

Public Health England (2020) explains: “Cycle threshold (Ct) is a semi-quantitative value
that can broadly categorise the concentration of viral genetic material in a patient sample following testing by RT PCR as low, medium or high — that is, it tells us approximately how
much viral genetic material is in the sample. A low Ct indicates a high concentration of viral
genetic material, which is typically associated with high risk of infectivity. A high Ct indicates
a low concentration of viral genetic material which is typically associated with a lower risk of
infectivity.”

tests. Thus, this testing procedure is completely uninformative if σ = 60%—the
lowest sensitivity of a PCR test reported by Alcoba-Florez et al. (2020). In this
case, Table 14 shows (sharp bounds on) population prevalence, PCR NPVs, and
CT scan NPVs. The PCR’s (assumed) low sensitivity means that its NPV might

be quite low, but it as at least close to 50%, irrespective of τ . On the other hand,
the CT scan has both a sizable interval and a low lower bound of possible NPVs.
Since σ = 0.6 is below the dilation threshold, the CT scan is completely uninformative for the tested population (equivalently for τ = 1). Furthermore, this
remains true for the overall population if τ ≥ 1/2 as shown in Table 14. For example, for a non-COVID-indicative CT scan the set of possible infection probabilities
P (x = 1|z = 0) increases relative to the prior information p.41
Even more striking is the data of Ai et al. (2020) shown in Table 15.42 Ai et al.
also use Chest CT scans to test for COVID-19. Their data is obtained in Wuhan,
China and like the study of Gietema et al. (2020) a PCR test is used as a reference.
The data reveals a very low apparent specificity but a high apparent sensitivity of
Σ = 96.51%. Expression (4) indicates that a high yield of the new test, ζ, might be
problematic. Here, this yield is very high with ζ = 87.57%. The problem becomes
even more apparent by looking at the dilation threshold, which is high with a
value of σ ∗ = 90.74. This implies that even if the PCR test is quite sensitive, the
CT scan is completely uninformative for the tested people in Wuhan.

Discussion and Extension

Imperfect Specificity of the Established Test and the Use of
Additional Data

Assumption 2 might be too strong for some applications. Although, this assumption simplifies the algebraic expression sometimes significantly, it is not a crucial
assumption conceptually. The crucial characterization of joint distributions in
Appendix A can easily be extended to allow for false-positives of the established
test.
Evaluations of a new test sometimes have more data available than just P (y, z|t =
1). For example, blood samples from before the existence of a virus can serve as
true-negative samples. On the other hand, specific blood samples could be analyzed with more sophisticated (and usually much more expensive) methods than
just using an established test as reference. These methods would lead to samples
with true positives (or at least with very high probability).43 Either of these methods would be provide additional data and therefore would also reduce the missing
data problem. In general, this supplementary knowledge leads to narrower bounds,
but unless these extra methods are performed for the whole tested population, the
missing correlation issues remains. Of course, these methods cannot be applied
for the untested population. Therefore the the missing data on prevalence cannot
be avoided with these extraneous data.
4.2

Beyond Binary Tests

The current framework only allows for binary outcomes for both tests and also
for the underlying health state. This seems to be the most common situation
studied in the literature on diagnostic testing. (Zhou et al., 2014) Often tests
provide ternary results (with the additional result of ‘inconclusive’ or ‘invalid’),
or allow for even more detailed information, like the Cycle Threshold Count of a
43

For example, Olbrich et al. (2020) combine these methods to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibody
tests.

27
PCR test as mentioned in Subsection 3.3. In such situations, the theoretic analysis
does not provide the appropriate machinery. However, the crucial application to
characterize the set of all joint distribution is a result in copula theory (Joe, 1997,
Theorem 3.10), which does not rely on any dimension being binary. Indeed, the
result even works for continuous outcomes on each dimension.
Similarly, one could use other results in Joe (1997) to characterize the set of
possible joint distributions if multiple tests are conducted simultaneously as studied in Zhou et al. (2014, Chapter 9). In this case, and like in the characterization
of Appendix A, the testing data are higher-dimensional marginal distribution of an
overall joint distribution with an additional dimension (the health state). When
considering such an extension, a caution has to be taken because sometimes sharp
bounds on the set of possible higher-dimensional distributions may not be known.
4.3

COVID-19 related testing

Since testing has a potentially big impact on the economy, an accurate description
of the available testing technology is crucial. From the microeconomic perspective,
the testing technology affects how test should be optimally allocated (see Ely et al.
(2020), Lipnowski and Ravid (2020)) and also how much people engage in social
distancing as studied by Acemoglu et al. (2020). But also the macroeconomy is
highly affected by testing strategies and an optimal choice might reduce the economic costs of pandemics considerably. (Alvarez et al., 2020; Eichenbaum et al.,
2020) Although, these studies establish the importance of testing and also address
varying testing technologies, all of them assume that a test corresponds to an
experiment à la Blackwell (1951) and therefore is always informative (sometimes
the assumption is even that the test itself provides perfect information).
This paper demonstrates that the assumption of unambiguous information in
test results is only applicable if a perfect reference is available when evaluating new
tests. In particular, new Antigen test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 are evaluated
relative to an imperfect PCR test and therefore—as shown in this paper—these
Antigen test produce ambiguous information. An optimal testing procedure should
take this ambiguity into account. Similarly, practitioner guides (like Galeotti et al.
(2020); Watson et al. (2020)) might want to consider addressing uncertainty in test
results in more detail.

Characterization of the set of joint distributions
P (x, y, z)

Consider a fixed Γ := P (y = 1) ∈ [τ γ, γ] with corresponding prevalence p :=
P (x = 1) = Γ/σ.

is given by Table 16.

3. P (x = 0, y = 0) = P (y = 0) − P (x = 1, y = 0) = 1 − Γ/σ.

Using the law of total probability and rearranging gives P (y = 1|t = 0) =

1−τ

Furthermore, by the nature of testing P (y = 0, z = 1|t = 0) = P (y = 1, z = 1|t =
0) = 0. Therefore, P (y, z) is given by Table 17.

By Joe (1997, Theorem 3.10) the set of all distributions P (x, y, z) with marginals
given by P (x, y) and P (y, z) is bounded by two extreme distributions:44 F Γ ≤ F ≤
F Γ , where F is the CDF corresponding to P (x, y, z), F Γ is given by Table 18, and
F Γ is given by Table 19.
44

The set of all these distributions, often called Fréchet class, is a convex set. Hence, here it
suffices to consider the extreme points only.
