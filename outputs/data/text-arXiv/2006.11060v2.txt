Abstract
In this paper, we study the trending behaviour of COVID-19 data at country level,
and draw attention to some existing econometric tools which are potentially helpful to
understand the trend better in future studies. In our empirical study, we find that European
countries overall flatten the curves more effectively compared to the other regions, while
Asia & Oceania also achieve some success, but the situations are not as optimistic elsewhere.
Africa and America are still facing serious challenges in terms of managing the spread of
the virus, and reducing the death rate, although in Africa the virus spreads slower and
has a lower death rate than the other regions. By comparing the performances of different
countries, our results incidentally agree with Gu et al. (2020), though different approaches
and models are considered. For example, both works agree that countries such as USA, UK
and Italy perform relatively poorly; on the other hand, Australia, China, Japan, Korea,
and Singapore perform relatively better.

Introduction

Words like “exponential rate” and “flatten the curve” have been widely cited by all sorts of
social media since the outbreak of the pandemic coursed by COVID-19. Since early 2020, governments of the entire world have been frequently updating their policies in order to manage the
spread of the virus, and reduce the death rate while constrained by limited medical resources.
Understanding the trending behaviour of the pandemic is therefore crucial from the perspective
of policy making.
The paper investigates the trending behaviour of COVID-19 data at country level, and draws
attention to some existing econometric tools which are potentially helpful in future work. Trend
modelling of COVID-19 data is challenging due to the following reasons at least. First, each
country shows a dominating deterministic trend, which wipes out other information. Second,
the policy of each country has been updated frequently during the pandemic, so analysis using
constant parameters may not reflect these impacts properly. Third, time series analysis cannot
be conducted for some countries due to small sample, while pooling data together yields a highly
unbalanced dataset. In this study, we aim to model the aforementioned challenges, raise some
difficulties, and call for studies which can account for these features simultaneously.
Based on our investigation, we find the following econometric literature is particularly useful.
Deterministic time trend modelling (such as Phillips, 2007, Robinson, 2012 and Gao et al., 2020)
helps address the first challenge. Time-varying coefficient models which date back to Robinson
(1989, 1991) or works even earlier are useful to address the second challenge. In some recent
studies, both Gu et al. (2020) and Li and Linton (2020) conduct time series analysis on COVID19 data of selected countries for different purposes, while Liu et al. (2020) forecast infection
of COVID-19 using panel data by a Bayesian methodology. They all agree that time-varying
coefficients should be adopted to investigate pandemic data. Factor models and relevant data
imputation techniques are closely related to the first and third challenges (e.g., Bai and Ng, 2002,
2019, Su and Wang, 2017, and Su et al., 2019). It is noteworthy that Bai and Ng (2019) and Su
et al. (2019) have worked out that certain types of random missing data can be dealt within the
framework of factor analysis effectively.
In our empirical study, we find that European countries overall flatten the curves more effectively compared to the other regions, while Asia & Oceania also achieve some success, but the
situations are not as optimistic elsewhere. Africa and America are still facing serious challenges
in terms of managing the spread of the virus, and reducing the death rate, although in Africa
the virus spreads slower and has a lower death rate than the other regions. By comparing the
performances of different countries, our results incidentally agree with Gu et al. (2020), though
different approaches and models are considered. For example, both works agree that countries
1

such as USA, UK and Italy perform relatively poorly; on the other hand, Australia, China,
Japan, Korea, and Singapore perform relatively better.
The rest of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the model, and the estimation strategy
with associated asymptotic properties. In section 3, we provide our empirical findings. Section
4 concludes. Theoretical development, tables and figures are provided in the appendix.
Before proceeding further, it is convenient to introduce some notation that will be used
throughout this paper. bAc means the largest integer not exceeding A; K(·) and h represent
a kernel function and a bandwidth of the nonparametric kernel method, respectively; Kh (u) =
K(u/h)/h; I(·) stands for the indicator function; diag{A1 , . . . , Ak } means constructing a diagonal
matrix from A1 , . . . , Ak .

Methodology

In this section, we consider two models which we believe are useful to investigate the time trend
of COVID-19.

2.1

Model 1

We now present the first model, which captures the trend aspect. The countries, indexed by
i = 1, . . . , N , start experiencing the virus at different time points biT ∈ {1, . . . , T }. For many
countries we may have biT = 1, but not all of them. We now propose the following model:

 gi (τt )|t − βt,b |a + εit , for t ≥ biT
iT
yit =
(2.1)
 0,
otherwise
In model (2.1), yit is the logarithm of the observed number of new cases (plus one to include
days that have zero outcomes). εit is an error term capturing information less dominating than
the trend. Further assumptions will be imposed on εit later to account for potential omitting
variable issues, to capture second tier information over time, and to allow for certain types of
heterogeneity. Theoretically, βt,biT may be unknown. Practically, βt,biT accounts for the impacts
of different starting points, and may have different forms depending on the research questions.
A commonly used form of βt,biT may be βt,biT ≡ biT − 1. This is not the main focus of the paper,
as it does not impact on our empirical study very much. The trend of (2.1) can be regarded as
a common feature of the virus. Specifically, the value of a characterizes the rate of infection or
death. Larger a indicates a faster rate. gi (·) is a function to reflect the change of policy over
time for the country i, and captures some heterogeneous features across countries.

2

We can regard (2.1) as a panel data version of Gao et al. (2020) with an extra moving mean
βt,biT . This raises a few challenges that are raised in both the main text and the online supplementary appendix. Before proceeding further, we impose a condition to quantify the impacts of
missing values. Specifically, suppose that there exist a sequence of fixed points {b∗1 , . . . , b∗N } and
a known function β ∗ (·, ·) such that
biT
− b∗i = O(T −ν1 ),
i≥1
T
a
t − βt,biT
(2). max
− β ∗ (τt , b∗i ) ≤ C0 T −ν2 ,
i≥1
T

(1). max

(2.2)

where 0 ≤ C0 < ∞, ν1 and ν2 are fixed constants satisfying that 0 < ν1 ≤ 1 and ν2 > 0. When
βt,biT ≡ biT − 1 and β ∗ (τt , b∗i ) = |τt − b∗i |a , part (2) of (2.2) holds trivially. Without missing
values, biT ’s and b∗i ’s reduce to 1 and 0 respectively. Practically, the values of biT ’s and b∗i ’s can
be controlled by removing a reasonable range of periods from the beginning in order to reduce
the impacts of missing values. In practice, one has to find a balance between available sample
size and the impact of missing data.
We are interested in recovering information under the framework of (2.1)-(2.2). To carry on
our analysis, we write (2.1) in vector form.
Yt = It G(τt ) + It Et ,

(2.3)

where It = diag{I(t ≥ b1T ), . . . , I(t ≥ bN T )}, Yt = (y1t , . . . , yN t )0 , Et = (ε1t , . . . , εN t )0 , and
G(τt ) = (g1 (τt )|t − βt,b1T |a , . . . , gN (τt )|t − βt,bN T |a )0 .
1/2

Since G(·) is unknown, we adopt the nonparametric kernel approach, and multiply Kh (τt − u)
for both sides of (2.3). Given τt in a small neighbour of u, we obtain
G(τt ) 1/2
Kh (τt − u) ≈ G(u),
Ta

(2.4)

where G(u) = (g1 (u)β ∗ (u, b∗1 ), . . . , gN (u)β ∗ (u, b∗N ))0 . Thus, after proper normalization (i.e., T a ),
1/2

(2.4) is the leading vector when analysing Yt Kh (τt − u). However, a is unknown, so has to be
estimated.
In view of (2.3)-(2.4) and motivated by the construction of the Financial Stress Index2 , we
conduct the principle component analysis on the sample quantity
2

The largest eigenvalue and the associated eigenvector is calculated using 18 weekly data series in order to measure the degree of financial stress in the markets. See St. Louis Fed’s website for details.

ciated eigenvector of Σ(u) reflect the information associated with N1T Tt=1 It G(τt )G(τt )0 It Kh (τt −
u) only, which allows us to focus on the trending properties of the virus, and ignore the secondary
information asymptotically. To explain the intuition using an even simpler example, one may
consider conducting an OLS regression for yt = ρ t + εt , where as long as εt is not diverging faster
than t, the information of ρ can always be retrieved.
That said, let λu and `u be the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector of Σ(u),
and k`u k = 1. Mathematically, it is written as
λu `u = Σ(u)`u .

where Nu = {i | b∗i ≤ u − h, 1 ≤ i ≤ N }, and ]Nu represents the cardinality of Nu . Let
Ncu = {1, . . . , N } \ Nu . By construction, C rules out a set of time periods that we cannot make
inference on due to the availability of data. In practice, we may let ]Nτt ≥ N − ln N , which
replaces the limit in the definition of C as a practical guide to choose C. Alternatively, we can
let C = {maxi≥1 biT − c, . . . , T } with c being a reasonably small positive integer for feasibility
and simplicity.
Finally, the estimator of a is presented as follows.

[inf t∈C τt , 1]. As w → 0, let maxi≥1 supτ ∈D |Fi (τ + w) − Fi (τ )| ≤ c|w|µ , where µ
and c > 0 are fixed constants.
(b) There exists a function ḡ(u) such that supu∈D | N1 G(u)0 G(u) − ḡ(u)2 | = O(φ2,N ), where
R
φ2,N → 0, D ḡ(u)2 du = 1, and G(·) is defined in (2.4).
3. Suppose that supu∈D

Et0 Et Kh (τt − u) = OP (δT ), and δT /T 2a → 0.

Assumption Assumption 1.1 imposes restrictions on the kernel function and the bandwidth,
which are standard in the literature of kernel regression (Li and Racine, 2006).
In Assumption 1.2.a, the condition on Fi (τ ) requires Lipschitz continuity. It can be further
decomposed by putting restrictions on a, β ∗ (·, ·) and gi (·)’s, but it will lead to quite lengthy
notation and development. Assumption 1.2.b imposes an identification restriction. The condition
R
ḡ(u)2 du = 1 fixes the location of ḡ(u) along Y -axis, and it has no impact on the quantities in
D
relative terms that we shall explore in the empirical study.
As the error terms include information less dominating than the trend, all we require in
Assumption 1.3 is that the magnitude of the secondary information does not overwhelm the
trend presented by the virus, which can be regarded as how we model the omitting variable
issues in the current setting.
We are now ready to present the asymptotic results associated with our empirical investigation.
Theorem 2.1. Consider the model stated in (2.1) and (2.2). Under Assumption 1, as (N, T ) →

In addition, suppose b∗i = 0 for i ≥ 1.

`u,j

and `u,i stands for the ith element of

`u .
With a balanced dataset, the terms involving ν1 , ν2 , µ and ]Ncu in the above theorem will
vanish, and the asymptotic development will be much simplified. Utilizing panel data, the rate of
the second result improves the slow rate of Theorem 4.2 of Gao et al. (2020), wherein a detailed
explanation can be found.
The first result explains how the unbalancedness of the data affects the asymptotic results.
Also, it implies that we can recover the space spanned by G(u). Under the conditions b∗i = 0
for i ≥ 1, the result will reduce to supu∈D k`u `0u − PG(u) k = OP (φ1,N T ). It is noteworthy that
the condition b∗i = 0 for i ≥ 1 indicates that the missing value is negligible in the asymptotic
analysis, which can be controlled by choosing C in practice.
For the third result, without loss of generality, suppose that t > s. Note that there are
two ratios involved in Rts , i.e.,

|β ∗ (τt ,0)|
|β ∗ (τs ,0)|

and

kG(τt )k
.
kG(τs )k

It is not hard to see that the ratio

measures the rate associated with the virus, while the ratio

kG(τt )k
kG(τs )k

|β ∗ (τt ,0)|
|β ∗ (τs ,0)|

reflects the efforts that the

countries make to flatten the curves. For effective policies, the ratio Rts should be lower than 1.
The fourth result is also about a ratio that provides a way of comparing the effectiveness of
two different policies at the same time point. Note that gi (·)’s model the effectiveness of the
policies. A lower value of gi (·) indicates better efforts in terms of flattening the curve. Thus,
if 0 <

gi (u)
gj (u)

< 1, we may conclude the country i has a more effective policy compared to the

country j. Otherwise, the country j performs relatively better.
Finally, we comment on how gi (·)’s and β ∗ (·, ·) can be recovered. Since β ∗ (·, ·) and gi (·)’s
exist in the model through a multiplication form, they cannot be individually estimated without
further identification restrictions. If one is willing to impose a restriction (such as

G(u)0 G(u)
N

= 1),

then β ∗ (·, ·) can be recovered as suggested by the second argument of Theorem 2.1.1. If the form
of β ∗ (·, ·) was known, the asymptotic distribution associated with the estimate of each gi (·) can
be constructed as in Theorem 4.3 of Gao et al. (2020). Alternatively, Theorem 2.1.4 suggests
that for any given u we may pick an individual i as a benchmark, then recover the rest gj (u)’s
and β ∗ (·, ·) utilizing the ratio of the fourth result. As these are not the main focus of this paper,
we leave the choice of identification strategy to future study. In our empirical work we will
emphasise the identified quantities: a, and the ratios R∗ts =

Model 2

We consider a second model that is designed to capture a single peaked epidemic trajectory,
similar to Li and Linton (2020). We consider the following regression
6


 γi − gi (τt )|t − βt,b |a + εit , for t ≥ biT
iT
yit =
,
 0,
otherwise

(2.9)

where γi is the global maximum of each individual. When t = βt,biT , the global maximum is
achieved at γi .
If we have a complete trajectory of the epidemic, or at least data that includes the peak and
sometime afterwards, we may estimate γi directly. Specifically, we may take any local (in time)
smoother and maximize this over time. The smoothing method eliminates the error term and
then the resulting function is uniquely maximized at the true peak time. One then can use the
methodology of Section 2.1 to work with the transformed model as follows.

 gi (τt )|t − βt,b |a + ε∗ , for t ≥ biT

bi − yit and ε∗it = −εit + (b
where yit∗ = γ
Additionally, one may consider an estimation strategy that tries to estimated the parameters
of interest simultaneously to avoid the bias caused by the plug-in procedure. We wish to leave
it to the future study, but we examine the model (2.10) using the approach of Section 2.1 in the
empirical study as a robustness check.

Empirical Study

In this section, we investigate the time trend of the COVID-19 data. Before proceeding further,
we comment on two practical issues — the choice of kernel function and the bandwidth selection
procedure.
For the kernel function, we follow Hong and Li (2005) and Su and Wang (2017) to adopt a
boundary adjusted kernel:

 K((τt − u)/h),
u ∈ [h, 1 − h]
K((τt − u)/h) =
R
 K((τ − u)/h)/ (1−u)/h K(w)dw, u ∈ (1 − h, 1]
t
−1
for t = 1, . . . , T , where K(w) is the Epanechnikov kernel. By construction of C, there is no need
to adjust the left boundary.
Next, we provide a bandwidth selection procedure which minimizes a leave-one-out cross
validation function as follows.

h = argminh CV(h),

CV(h) =

the normalized Yt are on the same scale. To examine the sensitivity of the bandwidth selection
procedure, we further consider hL = 0.8b
h and hR = 1.2b
h.

3.1

Data

We focus on daily new infection and new deaths from four regions3 , (i.e., Africa (AF), America
(AM), Asia & Oceania (AO), and Europe (EU)); we account for population density of each
country in the following analysis. Note that there are only 8 countries from Oceania in the data
source, so we merge Asia and Oceania together. Population density is based on the data of 2018
from World Bank, and is measured as people per sq. km of land area. We exclude countries that
do not have the population density figures. For each region, the sample period starts from the
date when the first confirmed case is recorded, but we remove the first 30 days of each region
in order to reduce the impacts of missing data. Finally, we summarize the available sample in
Table A.1.
For infection data, the four regions have roughly the same number of countries. However,
death data are very unbalanced. We remove the countries with total deaths less than 20 at
31/05/2020, which is why the number of countries drops for death data. It is not surprising
that Asia & Oceania has the longest period due to early outbreak of China, while Africa has the
shortest period.

3.2

Results Associated with Model (2.1)

We now start conducting numerical analysis using the approach of Section 2.1. Specifically, we
consider two sets of {yit } for both infection and death.

3.2.1

Overall Analysis

We let C = {bT /4c + 1, . . . , T } for simplicity, and summarize the estimates of a in Table A.2,
which shows that the estimates are not overly sensitive to different choices of the bandwidth.
For infection data, Europe has the highest values of b
a for both Cases 1 and 2, which could
be due to overall high quality infrastructure leading to high mobility of the entire population.
Moreover, America and Asia & Oceania have roughly similar values in both Cases 1 and 2, while
Africa has the lowest value, which implies that the virus spreads in Africa slower than the other
regions.
For death data, America has the highest death rate for both Cases 1 and 2. Although the
estimates from the original data (i.e., Case 1) indicate that Africa has a very low death rate,
the estimates from the normalized version (i.e., Case 2) indicates that the situation is not too
optimistic but is still the best among four regions.
Next, we examine the ratio Rt+1,t for t = bT /4c + 1, . . . , T − 1 by the third result of Theorem
2.1, and plot them in Figures A.1 and A.2 for infection and death data respectively. We explore
infection in Figure A.1 first. For Case 1, the curves of Africa and America are always above
1, although approaching to 1 slowly. However, for Case 2, the plot of America diverges from 1
during the entire period. Europe is the only region achieving a rate lower than 1 during April and
most time of May based on the original data and normalized data. In this sense, we believe the
policies of European countries are most effective. The curves of Asian & Oceania move around
1 all the time for both cases, but is slightly higher than 1 in most of the days. It is noteworthy
that most curves of Figure A.1 diverging from 1 from late May, which might be due to the fact
that many governments start lifting the lock-down in May. For the ratios associated with death
data in Figure A.2, the patterns are almost identical to those presented in Figure A.1, so we do
not repeat the discussions.
3.2.2

Comparison across Countries

In this subsection, we compare the performances of countries in each region using the fourth
result of Theorem 2.1. Specifically, for each region, we let the country that has the largest
value of daily increase at 31/05/2020 be the benchmark, and label it by the index i = 1. We
summarize the reference countries in Table A.3. We then plot Qτt ,i1 for i ≥ 2 associated with
infection and death in Figures A.3 and A.4 respectively, where the countries are labelled by ISO
3166-1 alpha-3 codes. In each sub-plot, the legend is ranked by Qτt ,i1 from largest to smallest at
the time period T . The lines in each sub-plot reflect how the corresponding countries perform
at different time points compared to the reference country. As explained under Theorem 2.1,
(1). smaller value indicates better performance, and (2). a value less (greater) than 1 indicates
9

better (worse) performance than the reference country.
Our results somewhat agree with the findings of Gu et al. (2020). For example, (1). countries
such as USA, UK and Italy are at the top of the corresponding sub-plots in our investigation,
which indicates ineffective performance in terms of managing the spread of the virus and reducing
the death rate; (2). on the other hand, our finding also suggests that countries such as Australia,
China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore perform relatively well as in Gu et al. (2020).
3.2.3

Rolling-Window Analysis

Finally, we estimate a and the ratio R using a rolling-window sample in order to capture some
dynamics, which in a sense can be regarded as a robustness check on the sensitivity of the data.
We prepare the data as in Section 3.1, and remove the first 40 days for each region to avoid the
impacts of missing value on the 30 days rolling-window (i.e., T = 30 for each regression). For
P
each window, we let C = {26, 27, . . . , 30} and estimate R̄ = 41 29
t=26 Rt+1,t . We then record the
estimated a and R̄ from the first available window till the end.
For effective policies, we expect the estimates of a show a turning point at certain stage, and
expect the value of R̄ below one. We plot the estimates of each region in Figures A.5-A.8, where
the X-axis is indexed by the last day of the consecutive 30 days period.
First, we take a look at the values associated with infection in Figures A.5 and A.7. In
Figure A.5, the curves of Africa and America keep increasing with a very steady rate, which is a
concern from the perspective of flattening the curve. The curves of Asia & Oceania become flat
gradually, but the turning points have not shown up yet. Europe is the only continent which
has a turning point in Figure A.5, and the pattern exists in both Cases 1 and 2. It further
supports that European countries have more effective polices overall. In Figure A.7, the curves
of Asia & Oceania and Europe are approaching to 1, while the curves of Africa and America do
not. Especially, the values of R̄ of Africa start diverging from 1 from late May, which is also
worrisome.
Second, we turn to the results associated with death in Figures A.6 and A.8. Clearly, in
Figure A.6, the death rate of Europe has been dropping, while Asia & Oceania have managed
to flatten the curve, but the turning point has not shown up yet. Africa and America have
increasing death rates during the entire period. In Figure A.8, Europe still performs much better
than the other regions, as it is the only region having R̄ less than 1. The curves of Asia &
Oceania have been approaching to 1, while Africa and America do not show much improvement
during the period.

3.3

Results Associated with Model (2.9)

The data and the corresponding settings of this subsection are identical to those in Section 3.2,
but we work with the transferred version using (2.10). Still, we consider Cases 1 and 2 for the
transferred data. It is noteworthy that under the model (2.9), the interpretation on the values of
a, Rt+1,t and Qτt ,i1 are respectively different from those in Section 3.1. Specifically, the effective
policies would ensure relatively short periods to reach the peak of the pandemic. In this sense,
the first different is that large a may not be a sign of bad situation. The second difference is that
we expect the ratio Rt+1,t greater than 1 to indicate more effective policies, since larger Rt+1,t
implies reaching the peak with a shorter period. Finally, for the ratio Qτt ,i1 with i = 2, . . . , N ,
we expect a value greater than 1 to represent a more effective policy compared to the reference
individual.
Note that since Africa and America have not reached the peak with obvious reasons by
screening the data plots, we do not comment on the values associated with Africa and America
much below although the values for these two regions are reported.
3.3.1

Overall Analysis

We first summarize the estimates of a in Table A.4. For both infection and death data, it seems
to suggest that in Europe the spread of the virus and the death rate reach the peak slower than
the other regions by nature. For Asian & Oceania, the spread of the virus and the death rate
tend to reach the peak slightly faster than Europe for both Cases 1 and 2.
We now focus on the values of Rt+1,t presented in Figures A.9 and A.10. Consistent with
what we find in Section 3.2.1, Europe indeed has more effective polices, as the values of Rt+1,t are
greater than 1 in the entire period for both Cases 1 and 2. Asia & Oceania have some success,
but the situation is not as good as in Europe.
3.3.2

Comparison across Countries

For each region, the reference countries are the same as those in Table A.3. The legend of each
sub-plot is ranked by Qτt ,i1 from largest to smallest at the time period T , however, larger value
implies better performance in this case.
For the infection data of Europe, Case 1 of Figure A.11 fully agrees with Case 1 of Figure
A.3, i.e., all countries perform better than the reference country. For the death data of Europe,
a similar argument applies to Case 2 of Figure A.12 and Case 2 of Figure A.4.
Interestingly, for Asia & Oceania, the downward trending of Cases 1 and 2 in Figures A.3
and A.4 becomes upward trending in Figures A.11 and A.9. Thus, both models confirm that

11

compared to the reference country, the rest countries in Asia & Oceania have been improving,
or the situation of the reference country has been getting out of control.

Conclusion

In this paper, we study the trending behaviour of COVID-19 data at country level, and draw
attention to some existing econometric tools which are potentially helpful to understand the
trend better in the future study. In our empirical study, we find that European countries overall
flatten the curves more effectively compared to the other regions, while Asia & Oceania also
achieve some success, but the situations are not optimistic as in Europe. Africa and America
are still facing serious challenges in terms of managing the spread of the virus, and reducing the
death rate, although in Africa the virus spreads slower and has lower death rate than the other
regions by nature. By comparing the performances of different countries, our results incidentally
agree with Gu et al. (2020), though different approaches and models are considered. For example,
both works agree that countries such as USA, UK and Italy perform relatively poorly; on the
other hand, Australia, China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore perform relatively better.
