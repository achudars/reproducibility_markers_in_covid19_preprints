Abstract
The sudden spread of Covid-19 outside China has pushed on March 11 the World Health Organization to acknowledge
the ongoing outbreak as a pandemic. It is crucial in this phase to understand what should countries which presently lag
behind in the spread of the infection learn from countries where the infection spread earlier. The choice of this work is
to prefer timeliness to comprehensiveness. By adopting a purely empirical approach, we will limit ourselves to
identifying different phases in the plots of different countries, based on their different functional behaviour, and to
make a comparative analysis. The comparative analysis of the registered cases curves highlights remarkable similarities,
especially among Western countries, together with some minor but crucial differences. We highlight how timeliness can
largely reduce the size of the individual national outbreaks, ultimately limiting the final death toll. Our data suggest that
Western governments have not unfortunately shown the capability to anticipate their decisions, based on the
experience of countries hit earlier by the outbreak.
Introduction
Italy is presently the hardest hit country. Its death toll seems bound to rapidly overcome the Chinese case. Other
Western countries follow the same route. It is crucial in this phase to understand what countries presently lagging
behind in the spread of the infection can learn from countries where the infection spread earlier.
The first question we address is: which are the relevant numerical signatures to be monitored to check how effectively
a country is acting, compared to other countries, in containing the infection?
Here we show that an answer to this question can be given not relying on specific epidemiological expertise, but based
on a simple numerical analysis of public data available on the internet. It is widely acknowledged that comparison of
curves from different countries is made difficult by the different ways the detection of the virus is addressed. In
particular, the ratios of the tested population to the total population, among the countries addressed in this paper,
range from about 5.000/million in the case of South Korea, to 1.400/million for Italy to less the 70/million in the case
of USA1. Therefore, not only the real number of infected people might largely exceed the registered cases, but such
ratio (registered/total cases) might change country by country.
This difference is partly mitigated by two observations:
- in the specific spirit of this work, we will compare countries in the same stage of the epidemic. Considering the delay
of the outbreaks (Korea is grossly 10 days ahead of Italy and 20 days ahead of the States, as will be discussed later in
detail) Italy is grossly following the same testing curve as Korea while the USA lag behind by less than one order of
magnitude.
- we should assume that in advanced countries most symptomatic patients are counted among the registered cases
within a few days. These are exactly the cases we mostly want to focus on. The hidden background of asymptomatic
patients, though playing a role in determining the disease spread, is a less relevant datum in foreseeing the final death
count.
At the end of this analysis, remarkable similarities are found, especially among Western countries, together with some
minor differences. The extent and relevance of the observed similarities for the case of Western countries will justify,
ex post, the adopted approach.
Epidemiological curves are typically believed to follow the stochastic logistic model. Nevertheless, this assumption
cannot take into account situations in which the infected population reacts by drastic changes of its collective behaviour,
thus changing the virus reproductive number, in the course of the outbreak. A general model for Covid-19 diffusion
would require knowledge of all the specific virus containment measurements adopted in each single country, their
dates, and their quantitative effect on the reproductive number. This is so far beyond our present understanding.

The choice of this work is to prefer timeliness to comprehensiveness. By adopting a purely empirical approach, we will
limit ourselves to identifying different phases in the plots of different countries, based on their different functional
behaviour, and to make a comparative analysis. For more complex approaches, the human data analysis time could
easily exceed the obsolescence time of the dataset, which is of the order of a couple of days.

The plots of the three countries show
similarities and differences. We observe a
fast-growing exponential phase (#1) with a
large country-to-country spread of the
time constants  here expressed in units of
days (d) (CN:  =2.4d; KR:  =1.7d; IT: 
=3.0d). At some point, a pretty clear
transition to a slower exponential growth
(phase #2) takes place in each of the
countries. The three exponents (CN: 
=4.3d; KR:  =3.7d; IT:  =4.7d) are close
within ± 15%. After an interval of 8-10
days, the two Asian countries show
another sudden switch to a quite different
functional
behaviour
(phase
#3),
characterised by a sublinear growth, as
clear shown by the comparison with the
blue curve, representing linear growth
(i.e., a straight line in linear scale). Such a

switch allowed a remarkable slowdown in the growth of registered cases, preventing the infections from becoming
unmanageably high.
As for Italy, last data are aligning to a linear curve, which might well be the inflection point, anticipating a smooth
transition to a sublinear behaviour. The absolute number of the new daily cases in the country, about 3.500 on March
15, is still very high. By comparing the linear coefficient of the Italian and Korean blue curves, we observe in fact that
the former exceeds the later by a factor 7.
The comparison of the plots shows that, in spite of the extremely fast growth rate ( =2.4d, corresponding to a doubling
time of one day) the rapid response of the Korean society allowed to switch the growth to a slower rate before reaching
500 registered infected people. This rapidity is confirmed by the observation that at the time when only 21 infections
were found, on February 18, the Republic of Korea had already tested over 8000 citizens4. Italy had instead 322
registered cases by the time it reached the same number of tests on February 255. The perduring fast growth rate in
Italy rises major concerns and suggests that the cumulative final number of cases might exceed the Chinese case.
Comparison between Western countries.
The Italian case seems to correspond to the worst-case scenario among the ones analysed above. It suggests that while
Korea implemented a faster reaction than China, profiting of the lesson learned by the experience of the neighbour
country, Italy apparently showed a longer response time than both Asian countries, in terms either of diagnosis, or of
governmental decision, or else of change of individual habits. It is of great importance to verify how well the Italian
lesson was learned by other Western countries.
The plots reported in Fig. 2a,b,c,d show the curves of the four Western countries reporting the highest amounts of
registered cases: Spain, Germany, France and United States. For each of them is it observed that, excluding a very initial
phase, in which numbers were small and probably affected by the insufficient tests number, all datasets align to
exponential red curves with exponent  ~2.9-3.0d, corresponding to a doubling time D ~2.0d.

This timescale seems to be characteristic of the Covid-19 “free expansion” in all these countries or, to state it more
prudently, of the rate at which they are detected. We remind in this context that, in absence of large-scale screening
programs, most infected people are tested after showing symptoms, i.e. about 5 to 14 days after infection. Therefore,
the registered cases curves map the history of the past behaviours of the infected population.
We observe that, still at the date of March 15, the Spanish evolution is correctly described by the red exponential curve.
The US curve shows a minor deviation, which might well indicate a switch to phase #2. France has switched to the
second phase, with exponent  =4.5d. Germany has also switched to the second phase, with exponent  =4.2d.
The plot in Fig. 3 gathers all the curves above in the same plot, comparing them with the Italian curve. Among the
possible ways to plot the data together, the most significant one, by far, was found to apply a relative shift in time, in
order to “synchronize” the different starting times of the outbreak. We remark that, by normalizing the number of
infected people to the overall population, the US plot would have been shifted backwards by 5-6 days.

When plotted with the appropriate relative time scale (IT reference, DE, FR -9d, ES -10d, US - 11d), the data show how
early or late the different countries deviated from the red exponential “phase #1” curve with  ~2.0d, D ~2.0d. The
violet curve fitting the Italian “phase #2” is also shown. It can be qualitatively deduced that France, Germany and
probably the United States, on this particular conventional time scale, have switched to the violet curve grossly at the
same time as Italy did. Spain is potentially running towards a worse scenario, although the last points hint to a possible
alignment to the same violet curve, albeit a factor two above.

The plot in Fig. 4 graphically highlights the
importance of the early reactions. The numerical
history of the outbreak in Korea is compared to
the hypothetical outbreak evolution (dotted lines)
in case a two-day delay in the transition from the
red to the violet curve, rigidly reflected in a twoday shift in the transition to the blue curve, would
have taken place.
According to the estimation in Fig. 4, the
transition to phase #3 would have taken place on
March 3 with an infected population of about
14.500 people, about 3,5 times higher than the
actual number of registered cases at the real
transition, happened on March 1st. The same scale
factor would be applied today, within our
hypotheses, to the actual infected population.

Conclusion
We attempted an elementary, real-time analysis of the Covid-19 diffusion data updated at March 16. Timeliness was
preferred to comprehensiveness. Important information has been extracted by the data, but major caution is needed
in deriving general and far-reaching conclusions. Both the inhomogeneity in data acquisition rate in different countries
and the huge background of undetected, presumably asymptomatic, infected patients, are two major sources of
uncertainty. The criterion applied in the plot in Fig. 3 is highly instructive but, to some extent, arbitrary.
With all due prudence related to the uncertainties above, we believe the present analysis is an excellent and timely
starting point for further studies on the delayed effects on the curves of the response adopted by different countries.
Such response includes both individual changes of habits (hands hygiene, social distancing by own choice) and
restrictions imposed by the governments (closing of schools, constraints to the mobility of citizens).
The Korean example clearly shows that early diagnosis of the first infected patients and timeliness in the response can
largely reduce the size of the outbreak, ultimately limiting the final death toll. Our data suggest that Western
governments have not shown the capability to anticipate their decisions based on the experience of countries hit earlier
by the outbreak. Our hope is that this work can contribute to triggering early and appropriate responses to the Covid19 pandemic.
