Abstract
To track online emotional expressions of the Austrian population

close to real-time during the COVID-19 pandemic, we build a selfupdating monitor of emotion dynamics using digital traces from three
different data sources. This enables decision makers and the interested
public to assess issues such as the attitude towards counter-measures
taken during the pandemic and the possible emergence of a (mental) health crisis early on. We use web scraping and API access to
retrieve data from the news platform derstandard.at, Twitter and a
chat platform for students. We document the technical details of our

1

workflow in order to provide materials for other researchers interested
in building a similar tool for different contexts. Automated text analysis allows us to highlight changes of language use during COVID-19 in
comparison to a neutral baseline. We use special word clouds to visualize that overall difference. Longitudinally, our time series show spikes
in anxiety that can be linked to several events and media reporting.
Additionally, we find a marked decrease in anger. The changes last for
remarkably long periods of time (up to 12 weeks). We discuss these
and more patterns and connect them to the emergence of collective
emotions. The interactive dashboard showcasing our data is available
online under http://www.mpellert.at/covid19 monitor austria/. Our
work has attracted media attention and is part of an web archive of
resources on COVID-19 collected by the Austrian National Library.

Introduction

In 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe lead to a variety of countermeasures aiming to limit the spread of the disease. These include temporary
lock downs, the closing of kindergartens, schools, shops and restaurants, the
requirement to wear masks in public, and restrictions on personal contact.
Health infrastructure was re-allocated with the goal of providing additional
resources to tackle the emerging health crisis triggered by COVID-19. Such
large-scale disruptions of private and public life can have tremendous influence on the emotional experiences of a population.
Governments have to build on the compliance of their citizens with these
measures. Forcing the population to comply by instituting harsh penalties
is not sustainable in the longer run, especially in developed countries with
established democratic institutions like in most of Europe. On the scale of
whole nations, very strict policing also faces technical limits and diverts resources from other duties. In addition, recent research shows that, when
compared to enforcement, the recommendation of measures can be a better
2

motivator for compliance [1]. Non-intrusive monitoring of emotional expressions of a population enables to identify problems early on, with the hope to
provide the means to resolve them.
Due to the rapid development of the response to COVID-19, it is desirable to produce up-to-date observations of public sentiment towards the
measures, but it is hard to quantify sentiment at large scales and high temporal resolution. Policy decisions are usually accompanied by representative
surveys of public sentiment that, however, suffer from a number of shortcomings. First, surveys depend on explicit self-reports which do not necessarily
align with actual behaviour [2]. In addition, conducting surveys among larger
numbers of people is time consuming and expensive. Lastly, a survey is always just a snapshot of public sentiment at a single point in time. Often, by
the time a questionnaire is constructed and the survey has been conducted,
circumstances have changed and the results of the survey are only partially
valid.
Online communities are a complementary data source to surveys when
studying current and constantly evolving events. Their digital traces reveal
collective emotional dynamics almost in real-time. We gather these data in
the form of text from platforms such as Twitter and news forums, where large
groups of users discuss timely issues. We observe a lot of activity online, with
clear increases during the nation-wide lock down of public life. For example,
our data shows Austrian Twitter saw a 73% increase in posts from 9 March
2020 compared to before (2019-01-01 until 2020-03-08). Livetickers at news
platforms are a popular format that provides small pieces of very up-to-date
news constantly over the course of a day. This triggers fast posting activity
in the adjunct forum. By collecting these data in regular intervals, we face
very little delay in data gathering and analysis and provide a complement
to survey-based methods. Our setup has the advantage of bearing low cost
while featuring a very large sample size. The disadvantages include more
noise in the signal due to our use of automated text analysis methods, such

3

as sentiment analysis. Additionally, if only information from one platform
is considered, this might result in sampling a less representative part of the
population than in surveys where participant demographics are controlled.
However, systematic approaches to account for errors at different stages of
research have been adapted to digital traces data [3].
We showcase the monitoring of social media sentiment during the COVID19 pandemic for the case of Austria. Austria is located in central Europe,
serving as a small model for both Western Europe (especially Germany [4])
and Eastern Europe (e.g. Hungary [5]). Therefore, the developments around
COVID-19 in Austria have been closely watched by the rest of Europe. As the
virus started spreading in Europe on a larger scale in February 2020, stringent
measures were implemented comparatively early in Austria [6]. Using data
from Austria allows us to build a quite extensive, longitudinal account of
first hand discussions on COVID-19. Additionally, Austria’s political system
and its public health system have all the capacities of a developed nation
to tackle a health crisis [7]. Therefore, we expect the population to express
the personal, emotional reaction to the event, without being overwhelmed by
lack of resources and resulting basic issues of survival.
Interactive online dashboards are an accessible way to summarize complex information to the public. During COVID-19, popular dashboards have
conveyed information about the evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases
in different regions of Austria [8] and globally [9]. Other dashboards track
valuable information such as world-wide COVID-19 registry studies [10]. Developers of dashboards include official governmental entities like the national
ministry of health as well as academic institutions and individual citizens.
To our knowledge, the overwhelming majority of these dashboards display
raw data together with descriptive statistics of ”hard” facts and numbers on
COVID-19. To fill a gap, we build a dashboard with processed data from
three different sources to track the sentiment in Austrian social media during
COVID-19. It is easily accessible online and updated on a daily basis to give

4

feedback to authorities and the interested general public.

Method

We retrieve data from three different sites: a news platform, Twitter and a
chat platform for students. All data for this article was gathered in compliance with the terms and conditions of the platforms involved. Twitter data
was accessed through Crimson Hexagon (Brandwatch), an official Twitter
partner. The platform for students and derstandard.at gave us their permission to retrieve the data automatically from their systems. A daily recurring
task is set up on a server to retrieve and process the data, and to publish the
updated page online (for a description of the workflow see Figure 1).
The news platform derstandard.at was an internet pioneer as it was the
first German language newspaper to go online in 1995. From February 1999,
it started entertaining an active community, first in a chatroom [11]. In
2008, the chatroom was converted to a forum that is still active today and
allows for posting beneath articles. Users have to register to post and they
can up- and down-vote single posts. In 2013 a platform change made voting
more transparent by showing which user voted both positive or negative.
According to a recent poll [12], derstandard.at is considered both the most
trustful and most useful source of information on COVID-19 in Austria.
Visitors come from Austria, but also from other parts of the German-speaking
area. In 2020, derstandard.at was visited by 2, 546, 000 unique users per
month that stay on average 06 : 42 minutes on the site and request a total of
215, 974, 000 subpages [13]. To cover the developments around COVID-19,
daily livetickers (except Sundays) were set up on derstandard.at. Figure S1
in the Supplementary Information shows an example of the web interface of
such a liveticker.
As no dedicated API exists for data retrieval from derstandard.at, we use
web-scraping to retrieve the data (under permission from the site). First,

5

we request a sitemap and identify the relevant URLs of livetickers. Second,
we query each small news item of each of the livetickers. We receive data
in JSON format and flatten and transform the JSON object to extract the
ID of each small news piece. Third, we query the posts attached to that
ID in batches. This is necessary because derstandard.at does not display all
the posts at once beneath a small news item. Instead, the page loads a new
batch of posts as soon as the user reaches the bottom of the screen. This
strategy is chosen to not overcrowd the interface, as the maximum number
of posts beneath one small news item can be very high (up to 2293 posts in
our data set). By following our iterative workflow to request posts, we are
able to circumvent issues of pagination. Finally, after we have received all
posts, we transform the JSON objects to tabulator-separated value files for
further analysis. This approach is summarised in the upper part of Figure 1.
To retrieve daily values for our indicators from Twitter, we rely on the
Forsight platform by Crimson Hexagon, an aggregation service of data from
various platforms, including Twitter. Twitter has an idiosyncratic user base
in Austria, mainly composed of opinion makers, like journalists and politicians. In the case of studying responses to a pandemic, studying these populations gives us an insight into public sentiment due to their influence in
public opinion. Yet, one should keep in mind that Twitter users are younger,
more liberal, and have higher formal education than the general population
[14].
As a third and last source, we include a discussion platform for young
adults in Austria 1 . The discussions on the platform are organized in channels
based on locality, with an average of 580 ± 390 (mean ± standard deviation)
posts per day from 2020-01-01 to 2020-05-27. The typical number of posts
per day on the platform dropped from 830±260 (January to April) to 160±80
1

Since the platform owners agreed to share data within the scope of the ongoing
COVID-19 crisis but do not want to be named in public, we must refrain to give details that can identify the platform. However, it must be noted that all data analyzed here
was publicly available and we did not analyze any private digital traces.

6

(April to May). This drop occurred due to the removal of the possibility to
post anonymously on April 4th 2020 in order to prevent hate speech. Based
on data from this platform, we study the reaction of the special community
of young adults in different Austrian locations, with the majority of posts
originating in Vienna (9%), Graz (8%) and other locations (83%).
To assess expressions of emotions and social processes, we match text in
posts on all three platforms to word classes in the German version of the
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) Dictionary [15], including anxiety, anger, sadness, positive emotions and social terms. LIWC is a standard
methodology in psychology for text analysis that includes validated lexica in
German. It has been shown that LIWC, despite its simplicity, has an accuracy to classify emotions in tweets that is comparable to other state of the
art tools in sentiment analysis benchmarks [16]. Previous research has shown
that LIWC, when applied to large-scale aggregates of tweets, has similar correlations with well-being measures as other, more advanced text analysis
techniques [17, 18]. Since within the scope of this study only text aggregates will be analysed, LIWC is an appropriate method and can be applied
to all sorts of text data that is collected for the monitor. For the prosocial lexicon, we translated a list of prosocial terms used in previous research
[19], including for example words related to helping, empathy, cooperating,
sharing, volunteering, and donating.
We adapt the dictionaries to the task at hand by excluding most obvious terms that can bias the analysis, as done in recent research validating Twitter word frequency data [18]. Specifically, we cleaned the lists for
(1) words which are likely more frequently used during the COVID-19 pandemic e.g. by news media and do not necessarily express an emotion (sadness: tot*; anger: toete*, tt*, tte*; positive: heilte, geheilt, heilt, heilte*,
heilung; prosocial: Heilverfahren, Behandlung, Behandlungen, Dienstpflicht,
ffentlicher Dienst, and Digitale Dienste all matching Dienst*), (2) potential
mismatches unrelated to the respective emotion (sadness: Harmonie/harmlos

7

matching Harm*; positive: uerst; prosocial: Dienstag matching Dienst*) (3)
specific Austria-related terms like city names (sadness: Klagenfurt matching klagen*) or events (sadness: Misstrauensantrag matching miss*), and (4)
Twitter-related terms for the analysis of Tweets only (prosocial: teilen, teilt
mit).
For text from derstandard.at, we average the frequency of terms per post
to take into account the varying lengths of posts. As Twitter has a strict
character limit of 280 characters per post, Crimson Hexagon provides the
number of tweets containing at least one of the terms, based on which we
calculate the proportion of such posts. Posts have a median length of 61
characters in derstandard.at, 101 characters in Twitter, and 51 characters in
the chat platform for young adults. To exclude periodic weekday effects, we
correct for the daily baseline of our indicators by computing relative differences to mean daily baseline values. For derstandard.at data, the baseline
is computed from all posts to derstandard.at articles in the year 2019. We
use the main website articles for this instead of livetickers because during
2019, livetickers were mainly used to cover sport events (for an example see
https://www.derstandard.at/jetzt/livebericht/2000088339740/bundesliga-livelask-sturm)
or
high-profile
court
cases
(https://www.derstandard.at/jetzt/livebericht/2000088169126/buwog-prozessvermoegensverwalter-stinksauer-auf-meischberger). Thereby, we choose a
slightly different medium for our baselines to avoid having a topic bias in
the baselines. Nonetheless, it comes from the same platform with the same
layout and functionalities and an overlapping user base: 14422 users (75% of
total unique users in the livetickers) in our data set that are active at livetickers also post at normal articles. The speed of posting may differ slightly,
because the article is typically posted in a final format, whereas small news
pieces are added constantly in livetickers. For the other data sources, we
correct by computing the baseline for the indicators from the start of period
available to us (Twitter back to 2013-01-01, chat platform for young adults

8

back to 2019-01-01) to January 2020.
Finally, we combine the processed data and render an interactive website.
For this, we use ”plotly” [20], ”rflexdashboard” [21] and ”wordcloud2” [22]
in R [23], and the ”git” protocol to upload the resulting HTML page to
GitHub Pages. Using versioning control allows us to easily revert the page
to a previous state in case of an error.

Results

We track the sentiment of the Austrian population during COVID-19 and
make our findings available as an interactive online dashboard that is updated daily. We display the time series almost in real-time with a small
delay to catch all available data (see Figure 3 using derstandard.at as a
data source). It has features such as the option to display the number of
observations by hovering over the data point or to isolate lines and to compare only a subset of indicators. The dashboard can be accessed online at
http://www.mpellert.at/covid19 monitor austria/.
Table 1 shows several descriptive statistics of the data sets used. For
derstandard.at, we retrieved 111 livetickers with 10013 small news items. On
average, users publish 183 ± 156 posts under each of those items in the time
period of interest (2020-03-09 to 2020-06-03). Posts have a median length of
61 characters (see Figure S2 for a histogram of the length of posts). Posts
provide immediate reactions by the users of derstandard.at: The median is
at 24.7 seconds for the first post to appear below a small news item.
We use word clouds (Figure 2) to visualize the emotional content of posts.
While livetickers on COVID-19 cover the time period from 2020-03-09 until 2020-06-03, the baseline includes normal articles on derstandard.at from
2019. To highlight changes in language use during COVID-19, our word
clouds compare word frequency in the livetickers with the baseline: The size
livetickers
)|, where probbaseline
of words in the clouds is proportional to | log( prob
probbaseline
9

and problivetickers refer to the frequency of the dictionary term compared to
the frequency of all matches of terms in that category, in the baseline and
the livetickers, respectively. Color of words corresponds to the sign of this
quantity: Red means positive, i.e. the frequency of the word increased in the
livetickers, whereas blue signifies that the usage of the word decreased. By
combining these information, our word clouds give an impression on how the
composition of terms in the dictionary categories changed during COVID-19.
Our dashboard analyses a part of public discourse. We assume that the
lockdown of public life increased tendencies of the population to move debates online. Users that take part in these discussions often form very active
communities that sometimes structure their whole day around their posting
activities. This is reflected in our data in the word clouds of Figure 2 from
the increased usage of greetings (category ”social”), marking the start or the
end of a day such as ”moin”/”good morning” or ”gn”/”good night”.
We identified the following events in Austria corresponding to anxiety
spikes in expressed emotions in social media. Unrelated to COVID-19, there
was reporting on a terrorist attack in Hanau, Germany on 2020-02-25. The
first reported COVID-19 case in Austria was on 2020-02-25 and the first
death on 2020-03-12. The first press conference, announcing bans of large
public events and university closures as first measures, happened on 202003-10. It was followed by strict social distancing measures announced on
2020-03-15, starting on the day after. The overall patterns in the monitor
of sentiment in Figure 3 show that Austrian user’s expressions of anxiety
increased, whereas anger decreased in our observation period. We go into
detail on this in Section 4.
The sentiment dynamics on social media platforms can be influenced by
content that spreads fear and other negative emotions. Timely online emotion monitoring could help to quickly identify such campaigns by malicious
actors. Even legitimately elected governments can follow the controversial
strategy of steering emotions to alert the population to the danger of a threat.

10

For example, democratically elected actors can deliberately elicit emotions
such as fear or anxiety to increase compliance from the top down. Such a
strategy has been followed in Austria [24] and other countries like Germany
[25]. Reports about the deliberate stirring of fear by the Austrian government are reflected in a spike of anxiety on 2020-04-27 in Figure 3. The spikes
of anxiety at the beginning of March in the early stages of the COVID-19
outbreak may have been reinforced by anxiety eliciting strategies.
In an effort to provide an archive of Austrian web resources for future
reference, the Austrian National Library (NB) monitors the dashboard and
stores changes. There are a number of such initiatives also in other nations
[26] with the earliest and most famous example being archive.org. Through
selective harvesting of resources connected to COVID-19, the dashboard is
part of the NB collection ”Coronavirus 2020” (https://webarchiv.onb.ac.at/).

Discussion

Our results show patterns in the change of language use during COVID-19.
In the anger category, words related to violence and crime are less frequent
in livetickers since COVID-19 compared to 2019, indicating that reports and
discussions about violent events, or possibly even these events themselves,
become less frequent as the public discourse focuses on events related to
the pandemic. For anxiety, the most remarkable change is a reduction in
words related to terror and abuse, accompanied by a smaller increase of
terms linked to panic, risk and uncertainty. In the sadness category, the
verb ”verabschiede”/”saying goodbye” appears almost 9 times more often in
the livetickers. For prosocial words, terms referring to helping, community
and encouragement increased. From the social terms, the word ”empfehlungen”/”recommendations” occurs slightly more frequently, while topics of migration, integration and patriarchy are less often discussed. Finally, positive
terms that increase the most are the expression of admiration ”aww*” and

11

”hugs”, indicating that people send each other virtual hugs instead of physical ones.
Dynamics of collective emotions may be different in crisis times. While
they typically vary fast [27] and return to the baseline within a matter of
days even after catastrophic events like natural disasters or terrorist attacks
[28, 29], changes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria have lasted
several weeks for most analysed categories (up to 12 weeks in some cases).
In contrast to one-off events, threat from a disease like COVID-19 is more
diffuse, and the emotion-eliciting events are distributed in time. In addition,
measures that strongly affect people’s daily lives over a long period of time,
as well as high level of uncertainty, likely contribute to the unprecedented
changes of collective emotional expression in online social media.
The dashboard illustrates early and strong increases in anxiety across all
three analysed platforms starting at the time of the first confirmed cases
in Austria (end of February 2020). A first initial spike of anxiety-terms
occurs on all three platforms around the time the first positive cases were
confirmed and news about the serious situation in Italy were broadcast in
Austria. About two weeks later, levels rise again together with the number of
confirmed cases, reaching particularly high levels in the week before the lockdown on 16 March. Afterwards, the gradually drop again. In total, levels
of anxiety-expression did not return to the baseline for more than six weeks
from 2020-02-22 until 2020-04-07 on Twitter. On derstandard.at, levels also
remained above the baseline for more than four weeks in a row. Timelines for
Twitter and derstandard.at also show a clear and enduring decrease of angerrelated words starting in the week before the lock-down, as discussions of
potentially controversial topics other than COVID-19 become scarcer. This
decrease lasts for four weeks on derstandard.at (21 Februar - 23 April), but is
particularly stable on Twitter, where anger-terms remain less frequent than
in 2019 for 2.5 months in a row (2020-03-09 to 2020-05-29). In contrast,
prosocial and social terms show opposing trends on these two platforms:

12

They increase slightly but do so for more than 2 months on Twitter, where
people share not only news, but also talk about their personal lives. In
contrast, they decrease for more than 3 months in a row on derstandard.at,
where people mostly discuss specific political events or topics.The increase of
sadness-related expressions is smaller than changes in anxiety and anger, but
also lasted for about a month on Twitter, and two weeks on derstandard.at.
Interestingly, positive expressions were used slightly more frequently on all
three platforms for long periods since the outbreak. This trend is visible
from the beginning of March on the student platform and derstandard.at,
and further increases since restrictions on people’s lives have reduced. In
total, positive expressions are more frequent than baseline during the last
2.5 months (as of 13th of June) on derstandard.at. An analysis of collective
emotions in Reddit comments from users in eight US cities found results
similar to ours, including spikes in anxiety and the decrease in anger [30],
which suggests that some of our findings might generalize to other platforms
and countries.
The dashboard gives opinion makers and the interested public a way to
observe collective sentiment vis-a-vis the crisis response in the context of
a pandemic. It has gained attention from Austrian media [31], and from
the COVID19 Future Operations Clearing Board [32], an interdisciplinary
platform for exchange and collaboration between researchers put in place by
the Federal Chancellery of the Republic of Austria. Especially during the first
weeks of the crisis, multiple newspapers reported on the changes of emotional
expressions in online platforms [33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. Timely knowledge about
the collective emotional state and expressed social attitudes of the population
is valuable for adapting emergency and risk-communication as well as for
improving the preparedness of (mental) health services.
