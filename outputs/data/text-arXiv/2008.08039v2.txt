Abstract—The presence of oscillations in aggregated
COVID-19 data not only raises questions about the data’s
accuracy, it hinders understanding of the pandemic. Spectral
analysis is used to reveal additional properties of the data,
and the oscillations are replicated using sinusoidal resynthesis.
The precise behavior of the seven-day moving average is also
discussed, specifically, the cause of its jaggedness and the phase
error it introduces. In comparison, other filtering techniques
and Fourier processing produce superior smoothing and have
zero phase error. Both of these are presented, and they are
extended to isolate several frequency ranges. This extracts some
of the same short-term variability that is resynthesized, and it
shows that fluctuations with periods between 8 and 21 days are
present in U.S. mortality data. These methods have applications
that include modeling epidemiological time-series data as well
as identifying less obvious properties of the data.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Multiple groups are aggregating data on COVID-19 including [1]–[4]. By and large, they rely on a large number of other
sources for their data. A comprehensive list of data sources is
given by [1]. While the total number of daily cases and deaths
being documented is without precedent, surveillance of other
conditions has also produced comparable data. Daily data was
produced during the Haitian cholera epidemic [5] as well as
the West African Ebola epidemic [6]. Similarly, the World
Health Organization and various governmental bodies track
and published influenza data on a weekly basis.
For COVID-19, many countries and regions show clear
oscillations in their daily counts of both new cases and
new deaths. Over the course of just a few days, counts can
experience dramatic fluctuations. For example, between July
6 and 7, the number of deaths in Arizona jumped from 1 to
117 [3]. On June 19th, Brazil had 55,209 new cases and then
on June 21st, it had 16,851 [4].
A number of studies have examined the oscillations [7]–
[14]. A couple of these point out that oscillations have been
observed in prior epidemics [7], [8]. However, they also note
that this occurred over a considerably longer time scale. It
has been shown that the phases of the oscillations in different
regions tend to align with one another more often than not
[14]. Cases typically reach a maximum close to Friday before
falling to a minimum close to Monday [10].
A few different hypotheses have been proposed to explain
the oscillations. New York City and Los Angeles county

maintain their own data on COVID-19. According to [11],
in these datasets, dates are back-dated, and the oscillations
are not present in their mortality data. It was also shown
that oscillations in the number of infections resulted from
oscillations in the number of tests being administered on a
given day.
Even if the oscillations are caused by data acquisition
practices, their presence is problematic for more than just
mathematical analysis. They indicate that the data points
contain a large amount of error. Identifying the sources of
error could give insight into the shortcomings of data acquisition practices, and thereby lead to more effective pandemic
response strategies.
There is an absence of any standard procedures for reporting
and acquiring COVID-19 data. Estimation of the total number
of infections has been greatly hindered by tests not being
available. A number of seroprevalence studies [15] have sought
to help assess prevalence. Additionally, analyses of excess
deaths have indicated that the true death toll is probably
substantially higher than what is reported by data aggregators
[16].
The seven-day moving average has become an immensely
popular method for suppressing oscillations in COVID-19
data. It’s in widespread use by both news agencies and
researchers. While superficially simple, its precise behavior
is complex and unintuitive. Generally speaking, oscillations
are attenuated rather than removed. It also flips the phase
of oscillations if they lie within specific frequency ranges.
Many papers have looked at trend analysis and forecasting.
Some of these, such as [17]–[19], have employed alternative smoothing methods such as exponential smoothing. In
contrast, this paper employs methodology from signal and
audio processing theory. Spectral techniques are used for
improved data smoothing as well as the extraction of shorterterm fluctuations. Additionally, spectral analysis and modeling
techniques are used to resynthesize time-series oscillations. As
a source of aggregated COVID-19 data, the repository from
[1] is used.
II. S PECTRAL A NALYSIS A ND R ESYNTHESIS
Spectral analyses was performed in [8], [11]–[13] to study
the 7-day oscillation. Oscillations shorter than 7 days have
also been observed by multiple researchers, such as [8], [11],
[13].
Our own spectral analysis found 7-day oscillations for both
cases and deaths in many, but not all, countries. A number of

2

countries exhibit a 3.5-day oscillation, and a few were found
to have 2.33-day oscillations. Both of these time periods are
integer divisors of 7 days; thus, they are potentially harmonics.
Harmonics are frequently observed in physical systems, and
they are always present in more complex periodic waveforms
(e.g., square waves and triangle waves).
Three papers [8], [9], [12] used first differences in their
spectral analyses. Conceptually, a first difference is very
similar to a derivative. Both amplify higher frequencies and
attenuate lower ones. First differences have a phase response
that varies linearly with frequency, while true derivatives
have a phase response that is constant. For time-series data,
attenuation of low frequencies has the effect of removing longterm trends. For COVID-19 data, it also makes the peaks for
the 3.5 and 2.33-day oscillations more prominent relative to
the peak for 7-day oscillations. Spectrograms of the derivatives
are shown in Fig. 1 for six countries.
As of this writing, there are only around 185 days in the
COVID-19 time-series that are mathematically significant to
this paper’s analysis. From a signal processing perspective, this
is an extraordinarily small number of data points. Sections of
the daily counts also contain exponential growth and decay.
Selecting different time-ranges can cause the locations of
spectral peaks to wobble and sometimes disappear altogether.
Applying window functions is also problematic as data becomes blurred, leaving spectral features more difficult to
discern. It was observed that when Fourier transforms were
instead applied to the derivatives of the time-series, spectral
variations were reduced and features became more clear. This
is illustrated in Fig. 2 using a sliding time-window.
In this paper, derivatives are calculated in the frequency
domain. Time-domain calculations can also work; however,
various spectral, phase, and time-shifting artifacts generally
occur. Depending on the particular use case, such artifacts
might need to be accounted for. A brief comparison of several
differentiation methods is found in Appendix IV. Methodology
for computing frequency domain derivatives is outlined in
Appendix IV.
A. Resynthesis
Reproducing time-series oscillations can aid in understanding the weekly progression of the epidemic. It can be used
to forecast minimums, maximums, and plateaus in the daily
counts of infections, deaths, tests, and other data. It can
also help identify varying data acquisition practices, and it’s
potentially useful for detecting irregularities in data.
Given a time-series x[n] and its N -point Fourier transform
X[k], the magnitude and phase angle of the frequency components are respectively given by,

can then be reconstructed as,

x[n] =

+ θ[k] .

Using sinusoidal resynthesis, the oscillations were recreated
for the three aforementioned frequencies. The derivative of the
time-series was taken, followed by the Fourier transform. Then
Eq. 3 was symbolically integrated with respect to n, and the
summation was taken only for values of k that corresponded to
one of the three frequencies. The result is a waveform having
only the oscillations in the original time-series.
The input dataset is aggregated on a daily basis. To improve
time alignment, each data point was treated as having occurred
at 12 noon on its respective day. Resynthesis calculations
were then performed using minute-level time-resolution, and
the result of this is shown in Fig. 3 for five countries. The
waveform shapes can change overtime, and revisions are often
made to existing data points.
III. S MOOTHING AND I SOLATION
The behavior of COVID-19 time-series data can be better
understood and better characterized by altering its spectral
properties. In fact, spectral alteration is the precise mechanism
by which the seven-day moving average smooths data. In this
study, three methods were used for modifying the spectral
content of U.S. time-series data: the moving average filtering,
infinite impulse response (IIR) filtering, and frequency domain
processing. As an important first and final step, the data
underwent pre- and post-processing.
A. Properties of the Seven-Day Moving Average
In the context of digital signal processing, the seven-day
moving average is a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. Its
time-center form is non-causal, and it can be denoted by,
y[n] =

3
1 X
x[n − k],
7

(4)

k=−3

where x, y, and n are the input, the smoothed output, and the
time-index, respectively. Taking the Z-transform, rearranging,
and simplifying yields the filter’s transfer function,
H(z) =


1 −3
z + z −2 + z −1 + z 0 + z 1 + z 2 + z 3 .
7

(5)

Substituting ej2πf for z in Eq. (5) and taking the absolute
value results in the frequency response. It follows that the
frequency response in decibels is given by,
HdB (f ) = 20 log10 H ej2πf



,

(6)

where f is the frequency. The continuous frequency
phase

response is obtained by substituting H ej2πf for X[k] in
Eq. 2.
The frequency response for the seven-day moving average
is shown in Fig. 4. The three nulls in the plot occur for
frequencies with periods of 7 days, 3.5 days, and 2.33 days.
The presence of nulls indicates that the filter will completely

remove the respective frequencies. All other frequencies, including those periods less than 7 days, are still present. While
they are reduced in magnitude, it is enough to be the sole
cause of the jaggedness seen in media reports. The jaggedness
is illustrated in Fig. 6. To further muddle the data, frequencies
on certain intervals have inverted phases. This is illustrated in
the phase response in Fig. 5. A second application of the same
moving average filter will correct the phase inversions.

B. Processing Methodology
1) Pre- and Post-Processing: Padding the input dataset is
beneficial to all three spectral processing methods. It allows
the moving average to run to the end of the time-series.
It facilitates the initialization of the IIR filters, and it can

help prevent artifacts that frequency domain processing would
otherwise leave at the ends of the modified time-series.
Before processing, 28 days of synthetic data were added to
both ends of the original data. Each synthetic data point was
calculated by linearly extrapolating from the nearest existing
data points located at distances of 7m and 7(m + 1) days
where m is an integer. Numbers extrapolating to less than 0
were set equal to 0. After processing, sections of the output
data corresponding to extrapolated data were removed.
2) IIR Filters: Elliptic filters are a type of IIR filter. Their
steep frequency roll-off permits strong frequency isolation.
Frequency-dependent phase changes are a common artifact of
signal processing filters. However, these artifacts are canceled
out if filtering is applied twice in opposite directions.
Four elliptic filters were created using Python’s SciPy
library. Comparable functionality is found in Matlab and

then forwards. The filter design parameters are given in Table
I. Frequency response plots for two passes of two of the listed
filters are shown in Fig. 4.
3) Frequency Domain Processing: The Fourier transform
will convert a time-series to and from the frequency domain.
From there, its spectral content is readily modified. The
general formula for such operations can be written as,
y[n] = F −1 (Hs [k] · F(x[n])),

C. Results and Discussion
The moving average was applied to the COVID-19 data. The
result is plotted in Fig. 6. Using the parameters from Table I,
the elliptic filters and the frequency domain method were also
used to process the data.
a) Low-pass #1 (Fig. 7): The line is visibly less jagged
than the moving average. However, significant oscillations
longer than 8 days are still present. The elliptic filters and
the Fourier method are in almost perfect agreement with one
another.
b) Low-pass #2 (Fig. 8): The line is again less jagged.
Also, there are fewer lower-frequency oscillations. As in Fig.
7, the elliptic filters and the Fourier method are in almost
perfect agreement.
c) High-pass #1 (Fig. 9): The long-term trends are
effectively removed. As in the two low-pass methods, the
elliptic filters and the Fourier method are once again in near
perfect agreement.

d) Band-pass #1 (Fig. 10): The 7-day oscillation is fairly
well isolated. The resultant waveform is much more sinusoidal
in nature than that produced by the high-pass filter. Like the
other operations, the two methods agree very well.
e) Band-pass #2 (Fig. 11): A bandwidth of oscillations
with periods between 8 and 21 days is separated. Aperiodic
oscillations remain despite having 80 dB of attenuation on all
oscillations with periods shorter than 8 days. The remaining
oscillations are the same as those that were present in Fig.
7 but not present in Fig. 8. The two methods still produce
plot lines that overlay one another, albeit with slightly less
precision than in the other trials.

One thing to note here, is that the temporal resolution worsens
as the band-width is narrowed. A principle of Fourier theory is
that an arbitrary time-series can be represented completely by
a summation of sinusoids. Thus, if some of the sinusoids are
removed from the series, there could be oscillations in locations where the input series was near zero. Those oscillations
are in fact present in the input; they are just not necessarily
visible when the other frequency components are also present.
A practical example of this is resonance in the earlier part of
the data where there is a small number of cases, for example,
the period prior to day 10 on Figs. 9 and 10. On the other
hand, the time period prior to day 10 is of the least interest.

Significant spectral differences were observed among different countries. These differences are often evident in the
time-series data. For example, several countries had a large
peak for 3.5-day oscillations in at least one of their spectra.
Upon reviewing the respective time-series, a double-humped
oscillation was observed. Provided that there is no biological
explanation, this must result from some kind of tangible
difference in how information is being collected, reported, and
aggregated.
The oscillations in the time-series were recreated using sinusoidal resynthesis. This effectively recreated the minimums,
the maximums, and the general shape of the time-series data
including double-humps. This gives us some ability to predict
the behavior of the time-series over the course of a week.
IIR filters and frequency domain processing can be used
to selectively manipulate the spectral properties of COVID19 time-series data. When tuned appropriately, both methods
produce virtually identical results. The superior suppression
of higher-frequency components smooths data far more effectively than the seven-day moving average. It would be
difficult to argue that statistically sensitive calculations should
carried out using a statistically erroneous seven-day moving
average. Additionally, the isolation of higher-frequency components could be useful for predicting and modeling shortterm variations in observed data. Using the described methods,
fluctuations greater that 8 days and shorter than 21 days were
identified in U.S. mortality data. The cause and significance
of this is currently not known.

A PPENDIX A: N UMERICAL D ERIVATIVES
Many methods exist for approximating derivatives from
discretely sampled data. These include first differences, central differences, and frequency domain derivatives. The first
difference is given by
x0 [n] = x[n] − x[n − 1],

(10)

This is a backwards method, and it produces a time-shifting
artifact of 12 sample period. More accurate estimates can
be achieved with higher-order methods. A central difference
formula is given in Eq. 11.
x0 [n] =(1/280)x[n − 4] − (4/105)x[n − 3]

+ (4/105)x[n + 3] − (1/280)x[n + 4]
Due to the symmetry about n, Eq. 11 produces no timeshifting artifact. It is also a higher-order formula. Frequency
domain derivatives exist as yet another method. See Appendix
IV for a mathematical description. For these three methods,
the phase and spectral responses are plotted in Figs. 12 and
13, respectively.

Multiplying H d [k] by the Fourier transform of the input redn
sults in the frequency domain representation of the derivative,

where F is the Fourier transform and x[n] is the time-series.
It follows that the derivative of x[n] is then given by
x0 [n] = F −1 (X 0 [k]),
where F −1 is the inverse Fourier transform.
