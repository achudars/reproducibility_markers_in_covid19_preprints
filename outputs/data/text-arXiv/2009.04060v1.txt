Abstract
There have been several documented outbreaks of COVID-19 associated with vocalization,
either by speech or by singing, in indoor confined spaces. Here, we model the risk of in-room
airborne disease transmission via expiratory particle emission versus the average loudness of
vocalization and for variable room ventilation rates. The model indicates that a 6-decibel reduction
in average vocalization intensity yields a reduction in aerosol transmission probability equivalent
to doubling the room ventilation rate. The results suggest that public health authorities should
consider implementing “quiet zones” in high-risk indoor environments, such as hospital waiting
rooms or dining facilities, to mitigate transmission of COVID-19 and other airborne respiratory
diseases.

Main Text
There is an emerging consensus that COVID-19 is transmissible via airborne aerosol particles
that are emitted when infected individuals breathe, speak, sneeze, or cough [1 -8]. The relative
contributions of these expiratory activities to airborne transmission remains unclear, but multiple
outbreaks have been documented in which asymptomatic carriers were speaking or singing in
confined indoor spaces with susceptible individuals [9,10]. Vocalization causes micron-scale
droplets of respiratory mucosa to form via a “fluid-film-burst” mechanism, either in the lungs
during inhalation due to expansion of the alveoli, or in the vocal cords due to rapid opening and
closing of the glottis during phonation [11-13]. Upon exhalation into the ambient air these droplets
rapidly evaporate to leave behind dried aerosol particles large enough to carry viable virus that,
although too small to see by eye, are lightweight enough to remain suspended for long times;
particles smaller than approximately 5 µm will typically be removed from rooms by air exchange
rather than gravitational settling [14-16].

Expiratory particles in this size range from exhaled

breath are known to carry infectious influenza virus [17]; likewise, viable SARS-CoV-2, the virus
responsible for COVID-19, has been observed in micron-scale aerosol particles sampled from
hospital air several meters away from infected patients [18].
We recently demonstrated that the emission rate of micron-scale respiratory aerosol particles
strongly correlates with the loudness of speech [19,20]. An increase in vocalization intensity of
about 35 decibels, roughly the difference between whispering and shouting, yields a factor of 50
increase in the particle emission rate. We also reported that the size distribution of the dried
particles is independent of vocalization loudness, and that certain individuals, for unclear reasons,
act as superemitters during vocalization, releasing an order of magnitude more particles than
average. We hypothesized that airborne disease transmission might occur more readily in noisy
2

environments where infected individuals must speak loudly, thus causing enhanced emission of
infectious expiratory particles into the air [19].

Epidemiologists have speculated that recent

COVID-19 outbreaks in churches [9], bars [21], or meat processing facilities [22,23] might be due
in part to the loudness of these environments. In response, various public health authorities have
provided official recommendations that discourage [24- 27] or even explicitly prohibit [28] singing
and other loud vocalizations, or prohibit conditions like playing loud music that necessitate raising
of voices [29].
Much remains unknown, however, about the possible link between vocalization loudness and
airborne disease transmission. If virus-laden particles are emitted via vocalization, and if louder
vocalization yields more particles, then a key question is: how does the loudness of vocalization
affect the transmission probability?
As a starting point to addressing this question, we use the simplest quantitative theoretical
model for airborne disease transmission, named the Wells-Riley model after the early investigators
who performed this pioneering work [30,31]. Detailed derivations and assessments of the
accuracy of the Wells-Riley model are provided elsewhere [32,33]; here we simply use the model
framework, which is that the transmission probability follows the complement of a Poisson
distribution,
𝑃𝑃 = 1 − 𝑒𝑒 −𝜇𝜇 ,

(1)

where 𝜇𝜇 is the expected number of infectious pathogens that a susceptible individual inhales. This
probability distribution assumes that only one pathogen is necessary to initiate infection, but more

complicated expressions are available to account for larger minimum infectious doses [14]. In the
classic Wells-Riley formulation, 𝜇𝜇 is calculated with the assumption that pathogens are emitted at
3

a rate q pathogens per second from one or more infected individuals in a room with instantaneously
well-mixed air, so that the relative positions of the infected and susceptible individuals are
irrelevant. As such, the model does not account for potential enhanced transmission by direct
inhalation of the respiratory plume emitted by an infected individual, but the assumption of wellmixed air serves in part as the basis for minimum ventilation standards promulgated by CDC [34]
and ASHRAE [35] because it yields a lower bound for transmission risk to all room occupants
regardless of position. The Wells-Riley model further assumes that the room has a ventilation rate
of Q liters per minute delivering fresh (pathogen-free) air, and that susceptible individuals are
moving B liters of air in and out of their lungs per minute of breathing (i.e., the minute ventilation).
In the case where there is just one infected individual, the expected value is
𝜇𝜇 =

𝜂𝜂𝜂𝜂𝜂𝜂
𝑄𝑄

𝑡𝑡,

(2)

where t is the total exposure time. The parameter 𝜂𝜂 here represents an infection efficiency (0 <

𝜂𝜂 < 1) that includes physical effects, like the deposition efficiency within the respiratory tract of
the susceptible individual, and immunological effects, like the ability of the immune system to
repress the infection. For a minimum infectious dose of 1 pathogen, the quantity 𝜂𝜂𝜂𝜂 is equivalent
to the “quanta” of infectivity initially used by Wells and Riley in their models [30,31].

It is already well known from equations (1) and (2) that increasing the exposure time or
decreasing the room ventilation rate will increase the expected number of inhaled pathogens and
the corresponding transmission probability [36]. What is new here is consideration of the impact
of vocalization intensity on the virus aerosolization rate q. The particle emission rates that we
previously reported were measured in a laboratory environment while using a microphone and
decibel meter placed near the mouth [19,20]. Importantly, the particle emission rate varied linearly
4

with the root-mean-square amplitude as measured by the microphone; the amplitude varies
nonlinearly with the corresponding sound pressure level in decibels (Fig. S1). Using these
measurements, we can relate expected particle emission rates to different sound pressure levels,
measured in C-weighted decibels (dBC). Full details are presented in the Supplementary material;
the final result is that the average particle emission rate is estimated to depend on the vocalization
intensity 𝐿𝐿𝑝𝑝1 , measured in dBC at 1 m from a non-masked speaker, as

�𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 and 𝑁𝑁
�𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 are scaled expiratory particle emission rates for breathing and vocalization,
where 𝑁𝑁
respectively, that depend on the expiratory flowrates. The parameter 𝜙𝜙 represents the fraction of

time the infected individual is vocalizing during the exposure time; 𝜙𝜙 is close to zero for

individuals who vocalize rarely such that breathing-related emission dominates, and approaches
one for those who vocalize continuously, such as in singing or chanting. The average virus
aerosolization rate then is

(4)

where 𝐶𝐶𝑣𝑣 is the viral concentration in the respiratory fluid of the infected individual, and 𝑉𝑉𝑑𝑑 is the

pre-evaporation volume of droplets emitted during vocalization. The parameter 𝜉𝜉 = 𝑉𝑉𝑏𝑏 /𝑉𝑉𝑑𝑑 ≈ 0.5
is the volume ratio of droplets emitted via breathing versus vocalization; several researchers have

found that vocalization yields significantly larger droplets than breathing [11,13,19]. Combination
of equations (2) – (4) into (1), and noting that the ventilation rate in a room with volume 𝑉𝑉𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 is

related to the air changes per hour as 𝑄𝑄 = 𝑉𝑉𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴, yields the desired probability,

is an effective rate constant composed of parameters that, for a given room and

specific virus, are not readily alterable by human interventions.
The striking feature of equation (5) is the large power-law dependence on the vocalization
intensity. A contour plot of the transmission probability versus vocalization intensity and duration
illustrates this pronounced impact for a 1-hour exposure time in a room with three ACH (Figure
1). The transmission probability is lowest in the bottom left corner, corresponding to infectors
who vocalize rarely and quietly, as might be observed in a library or quiet office space. In contrast,
the transmission probability increases gradually with duration and rapidly with intensity. It
reaches maximal values in the top right corner, corresponding to infectors who vocalize loudly and
close to continuously, as might be observed in a noisy bar environment or at a choir practice.
The model also gives insight on the cost-benefit analysis of increasing the room ventilation
rate. Fig. 2A shows the transmission probability versus vocalization intensity for different ACH
values. As expected, doubling the ventilation rate of fresh (pathogen-free) air decreases the
transmission probability. A notable feature, however, is that a similar reduction in transmission
probability can be gained, without changing the ventilation rate, simply by decreasing the
vocalization intensity by approximately 6 dBC. This reduction can be quantified via a risk
reduction factor,
𝑓𝑓 =

𝑃𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 − 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟
𝑃𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜

,

(6)

where 𝑃𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 is the probability at some initial condition and 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the adjusted
probability via an intervention either with an increased ventilation rate or decreased vocalization.
6

For simplicity, we can focus on small values of 𝜇𝜇 such that asymptotically 𝑃𝑃 ≈ 𝜇𝜇, in which case
1

the risk reduction factor for doubling the room ventilation rate is 𝑓𝑓 = 2. If the infected individual
1

simply vocalizes half as often (i.e., 𝜑𝜑 is halved), then to good approximation 𝑓𝑓 ≈ 2 as well.
Furthermore, keeping the room ventilation rate and the vocalization duration fixed, the risk
reduction factor for decreasing the vocalization intensity by 𝛿𝛿 decibels is
𝐿𝐿𝑝𝑝1 +25−𝛿𝛿

𝑓𝑓 = 1 − �

𝐿𝐿𝑝𝑝1 +25

10.6

�

.

(7)

To achieve a 50% reduction in risk for vocalization that ordinarily would occur at 60 dBC would
require a decrease of only 𝛿𝛿 = 5.4 dBC.

More precise calculations of the risk reduction factor

(Fig. 2B) show that in general, a 10 dBC decrease in average vocalization intensity is always more
effective at reducing risk of aerosol transmission than doubling the ventilation rate.
The risk reduction achieved either by increasing room ventilation or by decreasing the loudness
of vocalization is insensitive to the pathogen concentration in respiratory emissions or their
infection efficiency, though those quantities do affect the actual probability of transmission. In
other words, the numerical values of the probabilities shown in Figs 1 and 2A will vary with the
viral load of the infector, but the overall shape of the curves will remain the same. Similarly,
wearing of masks will reduce the particle emission rate of the infector and decrease the effective
deposition efficiency in susceptible individuals and thus decrease the overall probability, but the
relative risk reduction as characterized here will remain unchanged. We also emphasize that the
Wells-Riley model explicitly assumes the air is well mixed, and that more sophisticated plume or
puff models [37,38] or computational fluid dynamics models [39,40] are required to account for
the directionality and turbulent diffusivity of the airflow and proximity of individuals. Whatever
transport model is used, however, the vocalization source terms in equations (3) and (4) suggest
7

that reductions in vocalization intensity will strongly decrease the amount of virus available to be
transported, and thus decrease the overall transmission probability.
To relate these proposed decibel decreases to real-world situations, we consider typical noise
levels in different indoor environments, often measured in A-weighted decibels (dBA), which are
thought to better reflect subjective perceptions of loudness. Ambient noise in restaurants is
typically between 65–80 dBA, with an average of 73 dBA [41], and background noise levels of 75
dBA have been observed at day-care facilities [42]. Music plus crowd noise in bars and nightclubs
can average as high as 90-100 dBA [43]. The relationship between ambient noise levels and the
speech loudness necessary for comprehension is complex, but in general speech must be nearly
the level of the background noise to be understood, and speakers adjust their vocalization intensity
to maintain a positive signal-to noise ratio when possible [44-46]. As a result, all other things
being equal, a reduction in background noise on the order of 5-10 decibels will facilitate, if not
directly result in, a corresponding reduction in average speaking levels. Further, the relatively high
amount of background noise in many public spaces suggests that there is considerable room to
reduce noise levels behaviorally (e.g., turning music down, encouraging silence), since noise is
not inherent to the operation of many of these spaces (as opposed to industrial facilities). When
wearing facemasks, the reduction in the background noise necessary to achieve a similar
magnitude reduction in transmission risk may be larger owing to the need to speak more loudly
through the mask [47]. A more detailed analysis of mask filtration efficacy and vocalization
through masks is necessary to characterize the impact of this effect on transmission probability.
There are tremendous installation, maintenance, and energy costs associated with increased
ventilation rates, especially in air conditioned or heated indoor spaces [48].

In practice many

ventilation systems recycle a substantial fraction of the room air, so increasing the flow rate of

8

fresh (pathogen-free) air requires even more ACH. In comparison, there is little cost for signage
and dissemination campaigns aimed at discouraging use of loud voices in shared indoor
environments. Libraries, for example, are traditionally quiet in part because librarians promulgate
social conventions against loud conversations. The results presented here suggest that public health
authorities should consider fostering comparable social conventions in hospital waiting rooms or
other high-risk environments where people must congregate and social distancing is difficult to
maintain. The results also suggest that epidemiologists should consider the acoustic conditions of
indoor environments as a potential contributing factor in situations where outbreaks of COVID-19
or other viral respiratory diseases might occur.

Here we derive equation (3) in the main text, which describes the relationship between the
measured vocalization intensity, as measured in decibels, and the average emission rate of
expiratory aerosol particles. The empirical data and experimental methods are described in detail
by Asadi et al., Scientific Reports 2019; for reference similar results were reported by Asadi et al.,
PLoS One 2020. In brief, participants either breathed or vocalized into a funnel connected to an
aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) placed in a HEPA-filtered laminar flow (Fig. S1a). The APS

The key finding, shown in Fig. S1b, is that the rate of particles moving through the detector in

particles per second for speaking or ‘singing’ respectively (cf. Figs 2c and 3b of Asadi et al. 2019).
Importantly, however, not all of the exhaled air was fed into the detector. Typical exhalation flow
rates during breathing and vocalization (𝐹𝐹𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 ) range from 8 to 12 L/min (Loudon 1988, Gupta et
al. 2010), while the APS only detected particles in the sample flow at 1 L/min. As the breathing
and vocalization flow rates exceed the total APS flow rate (5 L/min) there is no dilution of the
sampled air. Thus, to estimate the total particle emission rate, we equate the concentration in the
detector to the exhaled concentration in the funnel (𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠 = 𝐶𝐶𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 ), yielding the relationship
𝑁𝑁𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 =

𝐹𝐹𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣
𝐹𝐹𝑠𝑠

𝑁𝑁𝑠𝑠,𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 ,

(S2)

where 𝑁𝑁𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 is the total particle emission rate from vocalization (p/s). A similar statement pertains
to the (non-vocalization) particle emission rate during breathing, 𝑁𝑁𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 . Over sufficiently long time
periods, the average total particle emission rate will reflect the relative amounts of time spent
breathing versus vocalizing, viz.,
𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 = (1 − 𝜙𝜙)𝑁𝑁𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 + 𝜙𝜙 𝑁𝑁𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 ,

(S3)

where 0 ≤ 𝜙𝜙 < 1 is the fraction of time the individual spends vocalizing. Inserting the
relationships defined in (1) and (2) into (3) yields
𝑁𝑁𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 = (1 − 𝜙𝜙)

Next, we note that the microphone amplitude 𝐴𝐴𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 is related to the sound pressure level in decibels
via a power-law relationship of the form
𝐿𝐿𝑝𝑝0 = 𝑐𝑐𝐴𝐴𝑏𝑏𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 ,

(S5)

as shown in Fig. S1C. Nonlinear regression yields best fit values of 𝑏𝑏 = 0.094 and 𝑐𝑐 = 105 dBC.
The decibel readings were recorded 6.5 cm from the mouth, but it is standard to report sound
pressure levels at a distance of 1 m from the noise source. Accordingly, we adjust the sound
pressure level as
𝑟𝑟

𝐿𝐿𝑝𝑝1 = 𝐿𝐿𝑝𝑝0 + 20 log10 𝑟𝑟0 = 𝐿𝐿𝑝𝑝0 − ∆,

(S6)

where ∆= 25 dBC for 𝑟𝑟1 = 1 m. Combination of (1), (2), (5) and (6) yields the particle emission
rate versus sound pressure level,

The independent variables of interest in equation S7 for modeling the transmission probability
are 𝜙𝜙 and 𝐿𝐿𝑝𝑝1 . All other parameters are known from the empirical measurements reported by
Asadi et al., except for the expiratory flowrates 𝐹𝐹𝑏𝑏𝑟𝑟 and 𝐹𝐹𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 . As noted by several authors, the
relationship between measured sound pressure level and the expiratory flow rate is quite
complicated, and depends on the pitch (fundamental frequency), the “open quotient” of the vocal
cords, the lung pressure and vocalization pressure threshold, and the glottal and epiglottal
resistances (Schneider and Baken 1984, Titze 1992, Jiang et al. 2016). As first summarized
succinctly by Rubin et al., there is a “lack of any consistent relationship between sound pressure
levels and air flow” (Rubin et al. 1967). Accordingly, as a first approximation here we simply treat
the average flow rate during vocalization as a fixed constant independent of the sound pressure
level, which in general will yield a conservative underestimate of the total particle emission rate
as sound pressure level increases. Model parameters and sources are listed in Table S1.
