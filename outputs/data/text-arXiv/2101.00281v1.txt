Abstract: Society is undergoing many transformations and faces economic crises,
environmental, social, and public health issues. At the same time, the Internet, mobile
communications, cloud technologies, and social networks are growing rapidly and fostering
the digitalization processes of business and society. It is in this context that the shared
economy has assumed itself as a new social and economic system based on the sharing of
resources and has allowed the emergence of innovative businesses like Airbnb. However,
COVID-19 has challenged this business model in the face of restrictions imposed in the
tourism sector. Its consequences are not exclusively short-term and may also call into
question the sustainability of Airbnb. In this sense, this study aims to explore the
sustainability of the Airbnb business model considering two theories which advocate that
hosts can cover the short-term financial effects, while another defends a paradigm shift in the
demand for long-term accommodations to ensure greater stability for hosts.

1. INTRODUCTION
Consumer habits have experienced several significant changes over the last few years and
many of these changes are mainly due to the emergence of online and cloud applications
available to consumers. The tourism sector has been one of the areas where these

transformations have become more visible and have allowed stakeholders in this area to see
and experience the tourism experience in a different way. Several authors such as Batinic
(2013), Hughes & Moscardo (2019), and Madhukar & Sharma (2019) emphasize that the
increased use and importance of new digital technologies has created challenges and new
opportunities for the tourism industry. Tourists are more engaged and informed through the
Internet. They use several mobile applications and have access, in real-time, to news and
online information about destinations, accommodation, or transportation (Dorcic et al., 2019;
Law et al., 2018). Furthermore, the Internet also facilitates the sharing of experiences between
users, which makes the user not only a consumer of information but also assumes a relevant
role in its production (Lammi & Pantzar, 2019).
With the emergence and diversification of the online platform market, the concepts of shared
economy and collaborative consumption also arose. Shared economy is a new economic
model based on collaborative consumption and activities of sharing, exchanging, and renting
goods. According to Wirtz et al. (2019), its essence lies in peer-to-peer (P2P) type
transactions, from person to person, and in leveraging resources with an emphasis on their
use, not their ownership. Frenken & Schor (2017) consider that for a company to belong to
the shared economy it must have the following characteristics: (i) the business should be
focused on access to underutilized goods; (ii) consumers should benefit from access to goods
and services; and (iii) the business should be supported by decentralized networks and
marketplaces. May et al. (2017) share the same vision in stating that one of the characteristics
of the shared economy is to make profitable assets that are little used and, in this way, to take
advantage of market gaps.
According to the actual sanitary conditions, in the context of a worldwide pandemic, a lot of
companies need to make crucial decisions. Either close or choose a way to adapt their
business. Some of them were really innovative and found creative ways to survive an
unknown situation posed by COVID-19 (Almeida, 2020; Harris et al., 2020). The Internet
was a major way to maintain the sale for some, but for other enterprises that furnish services,
it is time to innovate and find ways to adapt their offer in order to take advantage of the
situation. Flexibility and agility emerge as two crucial factors for the tourism industry to adapt
and mitigate the effects of travel restrictions (Ugur & Albiyik, 2020). The travel agencies,
airlines, hotels, seasonal infrastructures, and more were the first ones to take the blow of the

crisis. The World Tourism Organization estimates that revenues from tourism could fall by
$910 billion to $1.2 trillion in 2020 and between 100 to 120 million direct tourism jobs are at
risk (UNWTO, 2020).
Some succeeding economic models based on the shared economy were highly impacted too.
In this paper, we’re going to focus on the service provider platform, Airbnb, in order to
highlight the extent of the crisis. Since its establishment in 2008, Airbnb has become one of
the largest online accommodation providers and an epitome of the shared economy. The firm
has gained public and scholarly attention due to its disruptive effects on the hospitality
industry, impacts on housing markets, and legal conflicts over housing, taxation, and
consumer regulations. Today, the CEO of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, qualified these times as “the
most painful crisis of our lives" (Airbnb, 2020).
This paper will seek to understand and explore how Airbnb, as well as similar companies
using the same economic model, can survive considering the context of this global pandemic.
Equally relevant is exploring the innovative decisions that can be made to ensure their
sustainability in this period. This manuscript is organized as follows: In the first phase, a
review is made of the literature on the shared economy and the role of Airbnb in this business
model. Then, in the methodology, the methods adopted for information collection, analysis,
and interpretation are presented. After that, the results are discussed considering Airbnb's
evolution and sustainability perspectives. Finally, the main conclusions of the study are
presented, and some indications of future work are given.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Shared economy and collaborative consumption are concepts that are incorporated in a
business model characterized by the supply of goods, services or use of resources in a P2P
model, without any associated acquisition or purchase. From a conceptual perspective, the
shared economy represents a model based on the use of a good or service, without the
acquisition of the same, through a form of temporary ownership (Mont et al., 2020).
Therefore, this model replaces the classic concept of ownership. Although sharing practices
have always existed, which makes the shared economy innovative is the constant exchange
between unknown people, which is only possible due to technological development

91

Volume 5, Number 3, Year 2020

(Sutherland & Jarrahi, 2018). This model replaces the old sharing practices that were only
carried out between people in their proximity.
Technological advances and economic factors may appear to be the main factors that have
served as a pillar for the growth of collaborative consumption and the shared economy.
However, they are not the only determining factors. Paulauskaite et al. (2017) point out that
the shared economy and collaborative consumption have also influenced the way people
experience, consume, and produce tourism products. The transactions among consumers have
opened up a greater possibility for tourists to have a more authentic experience and feel the
comfort of a household outside the home. For many tourists, a social experience with a more
domestic side can be a very important factor for the use of shared economy accommodation
platforms, since this type of experience can hardly be acquired in the more traditional tourism
industry (Pung et al., 2020).
The available literature in the shared economy allows us to identify three main areas of
research. Firstly, there is research related to the business model that sustains this type of
economy and its effects on the various players (Barbu et al., 2018; Ritter & Schanz, 2018);
secondly, there are researchers looking at the social phenomenon of the shared economy
(Curtis et al., 2020; Habibi, 2019); and finally, the third dimension explores sustainable
development and the collaborative consumption economy (Liu & Chen, 2020; Mi & Coffman,
2019). According to Kim (2019), the most decisive factors stimulating the development of the
shared economy are the economic ones (e.g., consumer behavior, increasing population
density, global recession). However, other factors should also not be forgotten like the
technological and environmental dimensions (Pouri & Hilty, 2018; Wu & Zhi, 2016).
A lot of firms started to use this economic model such as Uber and Airbnb for example. The
sharing economy (SE) has allowed travelers to organize their trips in new ways. They can
book a room through Airbnb, travel in a car booked on Uber, eat food made by locals with
EatWith and move around a city with a shared bike, all at a lower price than they would
conventionally pay (Heo, 2016). These startups, like Airbnb and Uber, have experienced
enormous growth in recent years and operate on a global scale. This makes them face and
compete directly with more conventional hotel and transport companies and, in most cases,
they are more effective than their traditional competitors, namely in a competition based on a

92

Volume 5, Number 3, Year 2020

lower price that makes them more appealing to the consumer (Penn & Wihbey, 2016;
Hoffman, 2020).
We are currently observing a growing phenomenon of dematerialization in Western societies
whose pace has accelerated strongly in the last year in view of the processes of confinement
and increase of digital transactions between companies and people caused by COVID-19
(Almeida et al., 2020). In general, it can be concluded that dematerialization refers to a
relative reduction in the amount of materials or physical goods needed to perform economic
functions. Hadad & Bratianu (2019) refer that these dematerialization phenomena gain greater
expression in the digital sphere and in the intangible aspects of consumption. As a result of
this process, new organizational models such as Airbnb have emerged, which has fostered the
emergence of local temporary housing. Airbnb is one of the most relevant collaborative
consumer companies in the panorama and Guttentag (2015) characterizes it as a disruptive
innovation because it has decisively influenced the temporary accommodation market and
even the way of doing tourism. Airbnb can be used by tourists, travelers, and professionals
and allows the rental of a property without much bureaucracy in a simple way and with lower
costs (Guttentag et al., 2018; Steward, 2019). The whole process of booking accommodations,
payment, message exchanges takes place within the platform itself.
Airbnb's business model still has few regulatory mechanisms when compared to those facing
hotel accommodation. However, some cities (e.g., New York, Los Angeles, Boston) have
proposed legal mechanisms to limit the possibility of having paying guests for short periods
of time and special licenses are required to advertise a property and receive guests (Hamed,
2019). The way these restrictions are implemented depends heavily on each local government
and does not apply only in the USA. Also, in Europe, limitations on Airbnb's operation can be
found in Berlin and Barcelona (Doward, 2016). This government supervision is intended to
control the number of tourists in each city and to stimulate the rental market to fight the lack
of affordable housing for residents.
Studies are also emerging that show that the offer made available by Airbnb has negative
impacts on local hotel revenues. According to Guttentag et al. (2018), its negative impacts are
mainly on hotels of a lower range. Business owners of the hotel sector point out that the
company's tax burden tends to be lower because it is only an application that makes the
connection between advertisers and travelers which allows the company to offer lower prices
93

Volume 5, Number 3, Year 2020

(Bivens, 2019). This situation has caused a drop in hotel revenues as demonstrated in the
study conducted by Zervas et al. (2017). However, this impact does not seem to be common
to all destinations. The study developed by Blal et al. (2018) revealed that the volume of the
Airbnb offer does not influence the growth trajectory of local accommodation establishments
since Airbnb is seen by travelers as a complementary service. Finally, Guttentag (2019)
considers that the experience offered by Airbnb has reshaped travelers' expectations regarding
their stay, since one of the main transformations caused by the platform was to put a greater
focus on the traveler's experience.
The growing importance of the economy of sharing does not mean that a fundamental change
is taking place in the social perspective and in human relations, or that it represents the end of
the traditional economy. What emerges as an innovative factor are the business models that
allow rapid contact between unknown people who initiate transactions to meet their needs
(Ritter & Schanz, 2019). According to Wirtz et al. (2019), the rapid expansion of the shared
economy was essentially due to new businesses based on peer-to-peer platforms, which made
it possible to share goods and services. However, unlike Airbnb, many of these companies are
startups with a low level of maturity and high risks to the development of their activity.
Moreover, legal obstacles also arise because they are businesses that do not yet have formal
regulation (Cauffman & Smits, 2016).

3. METHODOLOGY
This study adopts the qualitative methodology for the analysis of the effects of COVID-19 on
the sustainability of the Airbnb business model. According to Queirós et al. (2019),
qualitative research allows understanding a phenomenon and interpreting its values and
relationships, not dissociating the thinking from the reality of social actors where the
intervenient plays an active role in the development of new knowledge. This type of research
aims to understand a phenomenon based on its observation and contextualization. Therefore,
the researcher seeks to understand the importance of the phenomena studied, according to the
perspective of the participants of the situation studied and then the interpretation of the
phenomena studied is done (Yin, 2015). In the context of the challenges posed by COVID-19,
the qualitative methodology is indicated to allow understanding a phenomenon with badly

defined boundaries and limits and whose impacts have to be accessed from multiple
perspectives.
Figure 1 gives a concise overview of the adopted methodology phases. It is organized into
three phases: (i) contextual stage; (ii) design stage; and (iii) analysis stage. In the contextual
dimension, the aim is to contextualize the impact of COVID-19 on the tourism sector,
considering that this sector was particularly affected by the pandemic. Still, at this stage, the
characteristics of the shared economy are presented and how it becomes relevant in the
context of globalization. The Airbnb business model is also analyzed. Then, in the design
stage, the research methods that support these studies are presented. Still, in this stage, the
sources of information are presented. and the process of data collection and interpretation are
described. Finally, in the analysis stage, theories supporting the future evolution of Airbnb are
presented considering the impact of COVID-19 on company activities and new social trends
and consumer behaviors resulting from the pandemic. It is also at this stage that the main
implications of this study are addressed and some perspectives of future research in the area
are given.

Secondary sources of information were used in the data collection process. Five types of
information were considered, specifically: (i) Airbnb's institutional website that allows
understanding the actions taken by the company to face the limitations imposed on the
movement of people and hygiene measures; (ii) books on the business model published by
Hoffman (2020) and Steward (2019) that seek to address the role of short-term rental and
Airbnb's operating process; (iii) research published in scientific journals and international
conferences that allows exploring the impact of COVID-19 on the sustainability of Airbnb's
operations; (iv) customer and host reviews that allow identifying the main concerns of the
agents involved in the process; and (v) personal and corporate blog that are also relevant to
have a sufficiently comprehensive perspective on the various paradigms of Airbnb's evolution
in the market. The adoption of multiple sources of information, simultaneously diversified
and comprehensive, seeks to capture the various perspectives and contribute to increasing the
robustness of the investigation process.

4. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
Even though the COVID-19 has affected all sectors, it has particularly affected companies the
shared economy model in the touristic sector. The simultaneous combination of these two
factors makes companies very vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 in areas such as income
reduction, job loss, and anxiety (Hossain, 2020). Above all, service providers are among the
most vulnerable. Airbnb lost in a few weeks 25% of its workforce, or about 1,900 people.
Furthermore, significant cuts were imposed on the marketing area and other sectors (Syed,
2020). Additionally, because it’s really unclear if Airbnb hosts should be considered
employees, contractors, or workers. Airbnb considers their hosts as contractors, and so they
do not have the responsibility for insurance and social benefits (Farmaki et al., 2020).
In the case of Airbnb, many hosts use their activity on the platform as their full-time
occupation and have multiple properties that are rented from property owners, so they are in
highly vulnerable situations. Due to the COVID-19, the occupancy rate of properties was zero
in many cities from one to more than three months. It is important to mention that Airbnb
decided to adopt a full refund policy for the guests at the beginning of the corona crisis
because of the political travel restrictions imposed by the governments. However, many hosts
believe that guests cancelled their bookings to receive a full refund, even if their reasons for
96

JOURNAL OF SMART ECONOMIC GROWTH

Volume 5, Number 3, Year 2020

cancelling were unrelated to the pandemic, and they feel that Airbnb did not consult with
them in the decision-making process. Consequently, some hosts had no income and felt
abandoned by Airbnb (George et al., 2020).
The question now is to know how Airbnb is going to react facing COVID-19 and all it
implies. They already lifted a $250m fund to support with cancellations caused by the
pandemic and Members of the Superhost club, which gives Airbnb hosts “more visibility,
earning potential, and exclusive rewards”, also have access to a $17m fund to help pay the
rents of their listed properties. (Temperton, 2020). In order to implement these measures, the
company had to make a cut in its budget, which caused a layoff of about a quarter of their
direct employees (Hu & Lee, 2020). Airbnb currently recommends that hosts adopt a more
flexible cancellation policy and make their calendar available for longer stays with weekly or
monthly discounts. The goal of adopting a more flexible cancellation policy is to increase
guests' confidence in the market so that they can proceed with a new reservation under
conditions of great instability in the area of public health; while having a more comprehensive
calendar demands that the reservations made can be longer and give hosts greater
predictability about the market demand. Other more innovative initiatives emerged as the
concept of online experiences that allowed Airbnb to offer unique online experiences about
the cultures and traditions of each region, such as cooking classes or guided mediations
(Freedman, 2020). With this, the aim is to offer a unique entertainment experience to the
tourist without having to leave home, but that allows the tourist to know the playful, social,
and historical context of each place. In addition to meeting a short-term need, these initiatives
also seek to arouse in the tourist the desire to know these places when the measures to restrict
the movement of people have been lifted.

4.1 Opposing theories about the future of Airbnb
It is possible to predict the future of Airbnb considering the multiple visions of hosts and
guests’ reactions and on how the company is going to adapt its business model to face the
pandemic and everything it implies. Two hypotheses can be formulated:


Hypothesis I: Hosts who are able to afford to cover their expenses for the duration of
the crisis, may choose to remain in the short-term market (would help the
sustainability of Airbnb);
97

JOURNAL OF SMART ECONOMIC GROWTH
www.jseg.ro



ISSN: 2537-141X

Volume 5, Number 3, Year 2020

Hypotheses II: Hosts who are not able to afford short-term expenses will opt for midterm and long-term rentals due to their relative stability to ensure their expenses will
be covered (would not help the sustainability of Airbnb).

4.1.1 Hypothesis I
Two kinds of hosts exist: the ones that use Airbnb as a subletting business based on rentalarbitrage with several listings and the others who are renting their principal residence. In both
cases, there are many advantages for them and, accordingly, they will not leave the platform
and continue short-term rentals.
Both types want by all means to avoid stable leases because it implies a lot more risk and less
profitability. Accordingly, a transfer of homes to long-term rentals will probably not occur as
a general trend. Moreover, the short-term rental market is way more highly profitable and
practical for landlords. They can sell the property, use it, or directly abandon the market when
they will with no legal procedure concerning the end of a lease (since there’s none). Another
advantage of this control over the asset is that the maintenance of the property is constant
since it is possible to check the condition of the apartments weekly; that tourists pay in
advance; and that the high turnover of "tenants" allows landlords to constantly speculate with
rental prices (Cocola-Gant, 2020).
Unfortunately, all these businesses and the rise of commercial intermediaries managing
properties for third parties, suggests that Airbnb was shifting away from its original
philosophy, becoming primarily a commercial space trading platform. We hypothesize that
the COVID19-induced super-shock will lead to a re-emergence of the original Airbnb ethos
(O’Neill & Ouyang, 2016).
An argument is also important to understand why hosts would want to continue renting shortterm. When the touristic activities will start again or even for the local or business travelers,
booking an Airbnb might become the safest accommodation the tourist can find. Touristic
apartments, unlike hotels, might have many years ahead of them, allowing the customer to
isolate himself and feel complete safe. Maybe travelers would feel more secure in private
condos rather than in a hotel resort where they will find themselves interacting with more
people (AFP, 2020). This perspective is confirmed in the study performed by Cheng et al.
(2020) that intended to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the sharing economy. The
98

JOURNAL OF SMART ECONOMIC GROWTH
www.jseg.ro

ISSN: 2537-141X

Volume 5, Number 3, Year 2020

findings of this study reveal that entire homes were more booked than other kinds of
accommodations. However, this doesn’t mean that entire homes are the perfect kinds of
accommodations in all minds. As reveal by Hawlitschek et al. (2016) and Räisänen et al.
(2020), trust between users is one of the most important factors in the shared economy model.
COVID-19 has created mistrust between customers and hosts beyond the transaction stage
(Yang et al., 2019). Therefore, it is expected that firms will experience difficulties exercising
control over safety rules and protocols to minimize coronavirus spread. There’re actually two
ways of seeing it for the problem of sanitary conditions: (i) people may now favor traditional
hotels over home-sharing because of hygiene standard because it is difficult to guarantee a
deep clean on a host-to-host basis after every guest; and (ii) people will prefer service
apartments over sharing accommodation and hotels due to hygiene and social distancing, even
after the COVID-19 crisis. Currently, Chua et al. (2019) state that the real challenge for
Airbnb will be to maintain the level of trust of its consumer to ensure its sustainable growth.
The understanding of the Airbnb sustainability phenomenon is also strongly related to
consumption habits and the role of transport companies, especially in low-cost airline
transport which has been a key pillar for the growth of Airbnb (Kunwar, 2020). This has
allowed the capture of new audiences that were not used to traveling, or that traveled less
frequently, and that now have much greater and diversified access. However, COVID-19
challenged this paradigm. The challenges are not only short-term but may also have long-term
repercussions. Therefore, the changes we are experiencing in the market may not be
temporary or of short duration. As Sheth (2020) points out, COVID-19 may have long-term
effects on consumers' consumption patterns. Also, in the tourism field, people are expected to
seek accommodation closer to home, safer, and more affordable.

4.1.2 Hypothesis II
The COVID-19 has prompted firms and service providers to think about their services
differently, and many have adopted strategies to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19.
Accommodation hosts are considering finding mid or long-term tenants and focusing on
domestic rather than foreign guests. This situation occurred in the summer of 2020 when
several European countries saw significant growth in the domestic tourism market. For
example, Portugal saw a doubling in this period in the demand for internal reservations in
99

JOURNAL OF SMART ECONOMIC GROWTH
www.jseg.ro

ISSN: 2537-141X

Volume 5, Number 3, Year 2020

spaces that were not as usual as spacious houses to house families, equipment to receive pets,
or longer stays (Antunes, 2020). It is expected that once restrictions will be lifted demand for
Airbnb-listed properties will increase again. But not all hosts will return to the short-term
market. Hosts will now factor into their calculations the risk associated with economic supershocks. Supply will reach an upper limit, irrespective of the demand (Dolnicar & Zare, 2020).
Landlords using short-term rentals may have realized how dependent they were on their
environment. The problem is that with the actual restrictions they have no power on the
reservation. There are no more international tourists which were the main source of income
usually. And with no guests, there’s nobody to pay the rent, and that leaves Airbnb
entrepreneurs open to huge financial liabilities (Tenderson, 2020). This is the reason why
some of them might add flexibility to their business and move to other forms of rental during
times when the short-term is no longer profitable.
Many cities worldwide are still struggling to find ways to regulate Airbnb (Guttentag, 2015).
In general, three regulatory approaches have been identified in the existing literature:
prohibition, laissez-faire, and allowing it with certain restrictions (Jefferson-Jones, 2014).
Since some governments such as Spain, are allowing “seasonal leases” it’s easier to avoid
making long-term contracts and keep their advantages by going to mid-term. The change from
short- to mid-term rentals is what seems to be happening during the current pandemic. It’s a
bit similar to ‘seasonal leases’ which propose the property for students (mainly) from
September to June and practice short-term during summer. But here, landlords will switch
way more often from one type of renting to another because the situation is too uncertain for
now.

5. CONCLUSION
Shared economy has the potential to revolutionize the way we buy and sell, use and provide
services, and think about market transactions. Shared economy and collaborative consumption
businesses can generate change especially in the tourism sector, as they attract new profiles of
travelers as individuals looking for low prices, local experiences, or environmental concerns.
Furthermore, these platforms are also a means of facilitating distinctive and authentic social
encounters between tourists and locals and contribute to the reduction of accommodation and
transportation prices for travelers.

Shared economy platforms are highly vast, but some platforms stand out for their success and
the way they have changed the paradigm of consuming certain services or products. Airbnb is
one of the best-known platforms that has changed the paradigm in the accommodation sector.
However, it was also one of the platforms that was most affected by the COVID-19
pandemic, due to its model based on the shared economy in the touristic sector. These effects
had a direct impact on the reduction of revenue and job losses, with simultaneous impacts on
both the economic and social dimensions. The company took short-term measures related to
the cancellation policy, security and cleanliness, long-term reservations, and online
experiences.
These measures, despite their relevance, are focused on an immediate response to the
challenges posed by COVID-19 to the operation of the business. However, their effects are
much deeper, and should be analyzed from the perspective of their sustainability. At this
level, two hypotheses were discussed: (i) maintenance of Airbnb's business model considering
that the financial effects of the pandemic are covered by the hosts; and (ii) change in the
behavior of the hosts that can focus on a longer lease that allows them to ensure greater
stability.
This study offers both theoretical and practical contributions. From a conceptual perspective,
it was possible to deepen the knowledge about the shared economy and the impact of
COVID-19 on this business model. In the practical dimension, this study is relevant especially
for Airbnb hosts to realize what strategies they can adopt to ensure the sustainability of their
business model while the effects of the pandemic are being felt. Predicting tourist behavior in
the shared economy is essential for making informed decisions that will both address the
sharp reduction in demand in the short term and ensure the sustainability of operations in the
long term. As future work, it becomes relevant to explore the impact of COVID-19 on other
businesses in the shared economy that are not restricted to the accommodation sector. It is
also relevant to explore the effects of COVID-19 on the economy of some cities that have
grown strongly in recent years due to the proliferation of local housing and low-cost airlines.
