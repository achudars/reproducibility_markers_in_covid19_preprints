Abstract
We investigate state-dependent effects of fiscal multipliers and allow for endogenous sample splitting to determine whether the US economy is in a slack state.
When the endogenized slack state is estimated as the period of the unemployment rate higher than about 12 percent, the estimated cumulative multipliers are
significantly larger during slack periods than non-slack periods and are above
unity. We also examine the possibility of time-varying regimes of slackness and
find that our empirical results are robust under a more flexible framework. Our
estimation results point out the importance of the heterogenous effects of fiscal
policy and shed light on the prospect of fiscal policy in response to economic
shocks from the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction

The debate over the role of fiscal policy during a recession has recently taken center
stage again in macroeconomics. One particular topic that has received substantial attention is whether the multiplier effect of government spending is state-dependent.
On the one hand, in a series of papers, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012, 2013a,b)
used data from the USA as well as from OECD countries and provided empirical evidence supporting that the fiscal multiplier might be larger during recessions than
expansions. On the other hand, Ramey and Zubairy (2018) constructed new quarterly historical US data and reported that their estimates of the fiscal multipliers were
below unity irrespective of the state of the economy.
In this paper, we contribute to this debate by estimating a threshold regression
model that determines the states of the economy endogenously. Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012) estimated smooth regime-switching models using a seven quarter
moving average of the output growth rate as the threshold variable. Their primary
results relied on a fixed level of intensity of regime switching. Instead of estimating
the level of intensity jointly with other parameters in their model, they calibrated
the level of intensity so that the US economy spends about 20 percent of time in a
recessionary regime. In Ramey and Zubairy (2018), the baseline results assume that
the US economy is in a slack state if the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent. To
check the baseline results, Ramey and Zubairy (2018) conducted various robustness
checks using different thresholds.
To be consistent with the empirical literature, we build on Ramey and Zubairy
(2018): we use their dataset and follow their methodology closely. Our main departure from the recent empirical literature is that we split the sample in a datadependent way so that the choice of threshold level is determined endogenously.
It turns out that the endogenized threshold level of the unemployment rate is estimated at 11.97 percent, which is much higher than 6.5 percent adopted in Ramey
and Zubairy (2018). Using this new threshold level combined with the same data
and specifications as in Ramey and Zubairy (2018), we find that the estimated fiscal
multipliers are significantly different between the two states and above unity for the
high unemployment state. Specifically, if the threshold level is 6.5 percent, the estimates of two-year integral multipliers are around 0.6 regardless of the state of the
economy. However, if the threshold level is 11.97 percent, the estimates are 1.58 for
the high employment state and 0.55 for the low employment state, respectively. If we
1

look at observations used in estimation, there is no period after World War II with
the unemployment rate higher than 11.97 percent. In fact, there is only one timespan
of severe slack periods in 1930s. In other words, the period of the Great Depression is
isolated from other periods, as an outcome of our estimation procedure. Therefore,
our estimation results suggest that (i) the fiscal multiplier can be larger than unity if
the slackness of the economy is very severe and that (ii) the post World War II period
does not include the severe slack state and thus, our estimates for the high unemployment state are not applicable to moderate recessions in the post WWII period.
However, after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US unemployment rate
rose to 14.7% in April 2020.1 Therefore, the estimation results in this paper shed
light on the prospect of the fiscal policy in response to the current economic shocks.
We also examine the possibility of time-varying regimes of slackness by including
a time dummy for the post WWII period and find that our empirical results are robust under this more flexible framework. All the computer codes and data files for
replication are available at https://github.com/yshin12/llss-rz.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the
econometric model and present empirical results. In Section 3, we give concluding
remarks.

Model and Empirical Results

In this section, we give a brief description of the methodology developed by Ramey
and Zubairy (2018, RZ hereafter). They consider the state-dependent local projection
method of Jordà (2005). Their baseline regression model for each horizon h has the
following form (see equation (2) in RZ):
xt+h =It−1 (αA,h + ψA,h (L)zt−1 + βA,h shockt )
+ (1 − It−1 ) (αB,h + ψB,h (L)zt−1 + βB,h shockt ) + εt+h ,

(2.1)

where It (·) is a dummy variable denoting the state of the economy, xt is the variable
of interest, zt is a vector of control variables including GDP, government spending,
and lags of the defense news variable, ψ(L) is a polynomial of order 4 in the lag
operator, and shockt is the defense news variable.

Recall that RZ assume that the economy is in the slack state when the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent. We instead adopt a threshold regression model and
parameterize It = 1{unempt > τ }, where 1{·} is an indicator function and unemp
denotes the unemployment rate. In other words, we estimate the model that endogenously determines the slack states that fit the data best. Specifically, we estimate the
following model using the least squares (see, e.g., Hansen, 2000; Hidalgo et al., 2019):
GDPt =1{unempt−1 > τ } (αA + ψA (L)zt−1 + βA shockt )

(2.2)

+ 1{unempt−1 ≤ τ } (αB + ψB (L)zt−1 + βB shockt ) + εt .

To estimate the threshold regression model in (2.2), define the objective function
QT (τ, θ) :=

T h

GDPt − 1{unempt−1 > τ } (αA + ψA (L)zt−1 + βA shockt )

−1{unempt−1 ≤ τ } (αB + ψB (L)zt−1 + βB shockt )

i2

,

where θ := (αA , ψA (L), βA , αB , ψB (L), βB ). Note that the model (2.2) is linear in θ
b easily for any
conditional on τ . Thus, we obtain the (restricted) OLS estimator θ(γ)
given γ. Then, the threshold parameter γ can be estimated by minimizing the profiled objective function:
τb := argmin Q∗T (γ)
τ ∈T



b
. To estimate this model, it is necessary to specify the
where Q∗T (γ) := QT γ, θ(γ)
parameter space T for τ . We set it to be the interval between the 5 and 95 percentiles
of the unemployment rates in the dataset and estimate τb by the grid search method.
In our view, the threshold regression model above provides a natural way to endogenize the level of slackness since there is a change point at τ for GDP in the model.
Note that the level of the slackness is determined endogenously by fitting the regression model for GDP in (2.2) and then it is imposed in the specification of It−1 in (2.1).
Considering that both RZ and Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012, 2013a,b) determine the criterion for the economic slackness based on the researchers’ discretion,
it is novel to determine the threshold point endogenously. Furthermore, as we will
see in the next section, the endogenous threshold estimate is beyond the range of the
values that RZ considered for a robustness check.
3

In general, estimating the change point τ tends to be robust to model misspecification. Specifically, in our context, the local projection argument may imply that the
model (2.2) is potentially misspecified; however, it is worthwhile to emphasize that
the change-point estimation tends to be robust against mild misspecification in the
regression function employed in each regime, as shown by e.g. Bai et al. (2008).
Before looking at the estimation results, we briefly describe the dataset adopted
in our empirical analysis. RZ constructed new quarterly US data from 1889 to 2015
for their analysis. The main variables include real GDP, real government spending,
the unemployment rate, and the defense news series. The real GDP data come from
Historical Statistics of the United States for 1889–1928 and from the National Income
and Product Accounts from 1929 to 2015. Real government spending is calculated by
dividing all federal, state, and local purchases by the GDP deflator. The unemployment rates before 1948 were calculated by interpolating Weir (1992)’s series and the
NBER Macrohistory database. Finally, the defense news series is constructed by the
narrative method of Ramey (2011), which measures changes in the expected present
discounted value of government spending. For additional details of the dataset, we
refer to Ramey and Zubairy (2018).

2.1

Endogenous Sample Splitting

Using the same dataset constructed by RZ, we obtain τ̂ = 11.97% for the threshold
parameter. This estimate is even higher than 8 percent, which RZ used for their robustness check. To appreciate our estimation result, we plot the profiled least squares
objective function (1 − R2 ) as a function of τ in the left-panel of Figure 1.
It can be seen that the minimizer is well separated at 11.97%, which gives the
graphical verification of τ̂ . On the contrary, there is even no local minimum around
RZ’s threshold value at 6.5%. To check the possibility of the second threshold level
below 11.97%, we re-estimated the model with the subsample for which the unemployment rate is lower than 11.97%. The right-hand panel indicates that there could
be a second threshold around 4 percent, but not around 6.5%.
We test for the existence of the threshold for the whole sample and for the subsample with unemp < 11.97 by adopting the sup-Wald test in Hansen (1996). Figure 2
gives a graphical summary of the testing results. We set the number of bootstraps to
2,000 and the trimming ratio to 5%. We use the heteroskedasticity-robust test statistic. The bootstrap p-value for the whole sample is 0.053 and we can reject the null

with the unemployment rate below 11.97, the bootstrap p-value for the same test is
20.3%. Thus, we conclude that there is mild evidence for the single threshold in the
data. Finally, the 95% confidence interval for the threshold variable is (11.97, 13.56).
The periods with high unemployment rates are relatively rare. The US economy
spent less than 10 percent of time in the new slack regime defined by 11.97 percent.
The shaded areas in Figure 3 show slack periods over GDP and unemployment rates.
There is only one timespan of severe slack periods from 1930Q3 to 1940Q3, namely
the Great Depression. We call this new slack periods as severe slack states (“hard
times”) compared to moderate slack states in RZ. There is no period after WWII that
belongs to the hard times in this dataset. However, the current recession belongs to
the hard times, as the unemployment rose to 14.7% in April, 2020.

2.2

State-Dependent Cumulative Multipliers

We now report the estimation results of the cumulative multipliers under endogenous sample splitting. It turns out that the new regime classification produces quite
6

different implications. Following RZ, we adopt the local projection method in Jordà
(2005) and use the military news as an instrument. Figure 4 reports the cumulative multiplier over 5 years (20 quarters) in each regime. To make the comparison
straightforward, we also show the estimation results of Ramey and Zubairy (2018)
next to our results.
When the 6.5% threshold is used in classification of slack state (that is, the moderate slack state), the multipliers in the high-unemployment state are negative up to
3 quarters and are indistinguishable to those in the low-unemployment state after 6
quarters. It is counterintuitive to observe that the multipliers are higher for the low
unemployment state. On the other hand, if the 11.97% threshold is adopted (that is,
the severe slack state), the multipliers in the high-unemployment state are mostly
positive and largely above those in the low-unemployment state and are around
unity after 10 quarters. In other words, the multipliers are all less than unity in
the case of the moderate slack state; however, they are substantially higher in the
case of the severe slack state. These results are robust to the choice of the instrumental variable. As additional empirical results, Figure 5 depicts the impulse response
functions in non-slack and slack periods, respectively. Both government spending
and GDP responses are much higher in slack periods.
In Table 1, we report the 2-year and 4-year cumulative multipliers when we use
the military news, Blanchard and Perotti (2002) shock, and the combined variable of
these two as an instrument, respectively. The basic implication does not change. The
estimates of the 2-year multiplier vary from 1.58 to 2.21 and the 4-year multipliers are
around 1. The main implication from our empirical results is that fiscal multipliers
can be significantly larger during severe recessions than in normal periods.
We illustrate the difference between our results and those in RZ by comparing
the effects of the COVID-19 stimulus package. The COVID-19 pandemic and the following economic lockdown increased the US unemployment rate up to 14.7 percent
in April 2020. This is the highest unemployment rate since World War II. To mitigate
the economic hardship, the US congress has passed the COVID-19 stimulus package
(the CARES act) whose total amount is 2 trillion dollars. In Table 2, we report the
difference of the estimated multi-year integral effects of the stimulus package when
we use the multipliers in this paper and those in RZ. We assume that 25% of the
total amount (500 billion dollars) will be spent in the immediate quarter and use the
cumulative multiplier estimates based on the military news shock. Two approaches

provide quite different results of the policy effect. Over two years, the difference
between the two estimates is 490 billion dollars. The gap decreases over time but it
is still 70 billion dollars after 5 years. Therefore, we conclude that the endogenous
threshold estimate gives quite different results of the fiscal policy effect, especially
when the slackness of the economy is severe.

2.3

Possibly Time-Varying Regimes

In this subsection, we explore the possibility of time-varying regimes of slackness.
One might be worried that the US economy changed after WWII such that the level of

10

slackness changed from the pre WWII period to the post WWII period. To deal with
this issue, we extend the endogenous sample splitting to the following specification:
It−1 = 1{unempt−1 + τ1 dt−1 − τ0 > 0},
where dt = 1 if t is greater than or equal to 1945Q4. The resulting regression model
has the following form:
GDPt =1{unempt−1 + τ1 dt−1 − τ0 > 0} (αA + ψA (L)zt−1 + βA shockt )
+ 1{unempt−1 + τ1 dt−1 − τ0 ≤ 0} (αB + ψB (L)zt−1 + βB shockt ) + εt .
To estimate this model, we need to optimize the least squares objective function with
respect to unknown parameters jointly. The parameters could be estimated through
the profiling method as explained in Section 2. Specifically, one may first estimate
the slope parameters θ := (θA , θB ) = (αA , ψA , βA , αB , ψB , βB ) given τ := (τ0 , τ1 ) and
then optimize the profiled objective function over τ by the 2-dimensional grid search.
We adopt more efficient computational algorithms developed in our previous
work (Lee et al., 2018) with the aid of mixed integer optimization (MIO). To explain
the algorithm, we first define some notation: yt := DGPt , ft := (unempt−1 , dt−1 , −1),
and xt := (1, zt−1 , shockt ). Then, the least squares estimator can be written as
b := argmin
(b
τ , θbB , δ)
τ,θB ,δ

T

[yt − x0t θB − x0t δ1{ft0 τ > 0}]

where δ = θA − θB . Instead of multi-dimensional grid search over τ , Lee et al. (2018)
propose an equivalent optimization problem by introducing a set of binary parameters dt := 1{ft0 γ > 0} and `j,t = δj dt for j = 1, . . . , dx , where dx is the dimension of xt .
The new objective function can be written as

The equivalent optimization problem becomes a mixed integer programming problem with some additional constraints. The new optimization problem can be solved
efficiently by the modern MIO solvers such CPLEX and GUROBI. One can solve
the optimization jointly or by iterating between (θB , δ) and the remaining param11

eters. The advantage of the new algorithm is that one can construct and estimate the
model, where the regimes are determined in a more sophisticated way by a multidimensional factor ft . We refer to Lee et al. (2018) for additional details.
By applying the joint and iterative algorithms proposed in that paper, we obtain
the following results:
Joint algorithm: (τ̂1 , τ̂0 ) = (−1.82, 11.97), obj = 0.0002636456,
Iterative algorithm: (τ̂1 , τ̂0 ) = (0.56, 11.97), obj = 0.0002636456.
That is, two algorithms yield different estimates but the same objective function values. It turns out that the regimes determined by two estimates are identical; that is,
τ̂1 has no role in determining slack periods.
In addition, we apply the model selection algorithm proposed in our previous
work (Lee et al., 2018). Specifically, we specify the penalized least squares objective function with the penalty term consisting of a tuning parameter λ > 0 times
the number of non-zero coefficients. The resulting specification of the endogenous
sample splitting rule is as follows:
T
X
t=1

"
yt − xt θB −

dx
X

#2
xj,t `j,t

+ λ|τ |0 ,

j=1

where |·|0 is an `0 norm of a vector. We implement it using MIO with λ = σ̂ 2 log(T )/T ,
where T is the sample size and σ̂ 2 = 0.00027 is estimated from the baseline model
with a single threshold at 11.97%. When we apply the penalized estimation algorithm, we find that the τ1 estimate becomes zero and is dropped from the model.
Therefore, there is no empirical evidence that supports time-varying regimes of slackness.

Conclusions

We have investigated state-dependent effects of fiscal multipliers and have found
that it is crucial how to determine whether the US economy is in a slack state. When
the slack state is defined as the period of the unemployment rate higher than about
12 percent, the estimated cumulative multipliers are significantly larger during slack
periods than non-slack periods and are above unity. Our estimation results empha12

size the importance of endogenous sample splitting. Furthermore, the effect of the
fiscal policy may be heterogenous with respect to the level of slackness in the economy, thereby calling for more research in understanding the heterogenous effects of
fiscal policy. Finally, our paper sheds light on the prospect of fiscal policy in response
to economic shocks from the current COVID-19 pandemic.
