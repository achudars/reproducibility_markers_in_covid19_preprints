ABSTRACT
The virus SARS-COV-2 caused disease COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by
WHO. Currently, over 210 countries and territories have been affected. Careful, welldesigned drugs and vaccine for the total elimination of this virus seem to be the need of
the hour. In this context, the invivo mathematical modelling studies can be extremely
helpful in understanding the efficacy of the drug interventions. These studies can also help
understand the role of the crucial inflammatory mediators and the behaviour of immune
response towards this novel coronavirus. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we
study the invivo dynamics of Covid-19. We initially model and study the natural history,
the course of the infection and its dynamics. We then validate the model by generating
two-parameter heat plots that represent the characteristics of Covid-19. We also do
the sensitivity analysis to identify the sensitive parameters of the system. Lastly, we
study the efficacy of drug interventions for Covid-19 by formulating an Optimal Control
Problem. The outcomes of these studies are multi-fold. The system admits two steady
states: the disease-free equilibrium and the infected equilibrium. The dynamics of the
system show that the disease takes its course to one of these steady states based on the
reproduction number R0 . The system undergoes a transcritical bifurcation at R0 = 1.

1 INTRODUCTION

From the sensitivity analysis, it is seen that the burst rate of the virus particles and the
natural death rate of the virus are the sensitive parameters of the system. Results from
the optimal control studies suggest that the antiviral drugs that target viral replication
and the drugs that enhance the immune system response both reduce the infected cells
and viral load when taken individually. However, it is observed that these drugs yield the
best possible results when administered together. Hence, it is concluded that the optimal
control strategy would be to use the combination of both these drugs which not only help
in patient’s recovery but also reduce the side effects caused to the patient because of the
minimal/optimal dosage administered. The results obtained here are inline with some
of the clinical findings for Covid-19. This invivo modelling study involving the crucial
biomarkers of Covid-19 is the first of its kind and the results obtained from this can be
helpful to researchers, epidemiologists, clinicians and doctors who are working in this
field.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Coronavirus caused disease COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by WHO.
Currently, over 210 countries and territories have been affected. As on 02nd May 2020, 2,
37, 996 people have lost their lives and more than 33 lakh people have been affected due
to Covid-19 all over the world [4]. This pandemic has catalysed the development of novel
coronavirus vaccines across pharmaceutical companies and research organizations. Drugs
such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ivermectin, lopinavir/ritonavir, mRNA-1273, phase I trial
(NCT04280224) and AVT technology are being used as therapeutic agents by different
countries for treating Covid-19 [1, 2, 3, 30].
In this context, the invivo mathematical modelling studies can be extremely helpful
in understanding the efficacy of the drug/medicine administered. These studies can
also help in understanding the behaviour of cytokines, chemokines and immune system
response of the body towards this virus [24, 26]. The results of these studies can suggest
the optimal drug regime for treating Covid-19.
Motivated by the above observations, in this paper, we propose to model and study
the invivo dynamics of Covid-19 with and without drug interventions to understand the
efficacy of drugs administered. We study these problems as Optimal Control Problems.
In the recent work [12], an in-host modelling study deals with the qualitative characteristics and estimation of standard parameters of corona viral infections. Some of the
mathematical models that deal with transmission and spread of COVID-19 at the population level can be found in [9, 17, 20, 31]. Modelling the Invivo dynamics of Covid-19

involving the crucial biomarkers, which is being attempted here is the first of its kind for
Covid-19.
The section-wise split-up of the paper is as follows: In the next section, we discuss
the pathogenesis of Covid- 19 and formulate the mathematical model dealing with natural
history. Further, we discuss the antiviral drug interventions that are being tried across
the nations and then we develop the invivo model incorporating these interventions. In
the later sections, we discuss the disease dynamics, we frame the optimal control problem
and do the optimal control studies. Finally, we present the discussions and conclusions
followed by a few pointers to future research in this direction.
2 MATHEMATICAL MODELS FORMULATION
PATHOGENSIS OF COVID-19
On Feb. 11, 2020 World Health Organization named novel corona viral pneumonia
induced as Coronavirus disease(COVID-19), which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Out of four coronavirus genera(α, β, γ, δ), β CoV strain showed 88% identity of
genetic sequence with two bat derived SARS corona viruses (bat-SL-CoVZXC45,bat-SLCoVZXC21) and 50% with virus causing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome(MERSCoV)
[22]. Therefore the functional mechanism in pathogenesis is also quite resembling with
SARS CoV and MERSCoV.
Human to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs either through droplet infection or direct contact from an infected person. Transmission from asymptomatics and
through faeco-oral route are also reported. After the entry of virus through droplet infection or through contact transmission from hands to the mucous membrane of mouth,
nose or eyes. It is reported that Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) plays crucial
role in providing binding site to the viral structural protein(Spike protein-S) on the cell
surface and subsequent entry into the host cell [27]. The SARS-CoV-2 have much higher
affinity towards ACE-2 receptors as compared with its previous conterparts(SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV). The ACE-2 expresses in lung alveolar Type-2 cells(AT2), liver cholangiocytes, colon colonocytes, esophagus, keratinocytes, endothelial cells of ileum, rectum
and stomach, and proximal tubules of kidneys. AT2 secret surfactant, which reduces
surface tension preventing collapsing of the alveoli and playing crucial role in oxygen diffusion across lungs and blood vessels.Viral antigens are presented by antigen presenting
cells(APC) which are Human Leucocyte Antigen(HLA) cytotoxic T cell(also known as
T-killer cell, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, CD8+) [18]. The virus enters the cell with fusion
of its membranes with host cell and begins transcription with ssRNA acting as template.
Synthesis of the viral proteins takes place in the cytoplasm of the pneumocytes, new
3

2 MATHEMATICAL MODELS FORMULATION

virus is released by budding and ready to infect new cell which is confirmed by presence of abundent viral antigens in the cytoplasm of the pneumocytes(AT2) in case of
SARS-CoV [32]. Viremia (viral particle in the blood/serum) was also noticed by some
authors along with very high levels of IL-6 especially among severe cases of Covid-19
illness leading to increase vascular permeability and impairment of organs [10]. Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS) is the common immunopathological event for all
the aforesaid corona viral diseases.One of the main mechanisms in causation of ARDS is
cytokine storm,deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response due to the release of
large quantity of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by immune effector cells.
These cytokines are identified as IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-2, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-α,
TGF-β and chemokines as CCL-2, CCL-3, CCL-5, CXCL-8, CXCL-9, CXCL-10. Severe
infections correlated high levels of IL-6, IFN α, CCL-5, CXCL-8 and CXCL-10 [10, 18].
Also the viral load was noted to be crucial in determining severity of the disease and
strongly correlated with the lung injury Murray score [21]. The cytokine storm is a violent attack by the immune system causing ARDS, multi-organ failure and eventually
death [18].
From the above discussed pathogenesis it can be understood that the study of both
the epithelial (pneumocytes) cells (including both the healthy and infected) and virus
population levels and their changes over the time due to inflammatory mediators play a
crucial in understanding the dynamics of pneumonia inflated COVID-19.
Motivated by these we first consider the following mathematical model.

The purpose of drug interventions can be two fold, the first to target the virus
replication cycle and the second based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to
boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated
inflammatory responses. Based on this the therapeutic agents for virus infections can be
divided into two categories each serving the designated purpose [30].
Drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and
drugs ivermectin, lopinavir/ritonavir inhibit the viral protease there by reducing the
viral replication. On the other hand clinical trials such as phase I trial (NCT04280224)
in China aim to enhance the innate immune system by increasing the production of
cytokines and chemokines with the end goal of increasing NK cells [30].
Motivated by the above clinical findings we consider an control problem with the
following drug interventions as controls.
u11 (t)

=

d1 (t) + d1 (t) + d2 (t) + d3 (t) + d4 (t) + d5 (t) + d6 (t)

u12 (t)

=

b1 (t) + b1 (t) + b2 (t) + b3 (t) + b4 (t) + b5 (t) + b6 (t)

and u2 (t)
Here the controls u11 and u12 incorporate the effect of drug interventions which
enhance the innate immune response which in turn leads to decrease in the infected
population and viral load. The control u2 incorporates the effect of drug interventions
which prevent viral replication thereby reducing the virus birth rate.

In this section we consider model 1 which deals with the natural history and course of
infection. We study its dynamics.
POSITIVITY AND BOUNDEDNESS
The positivity and boundedness of the solutions of the model is the fundamental thing
which needs to be established before doing any other analysis.
Positivity: We now show that if the initial conditions of the system (2.1-2.3) are positive,
then the solution remain positive for any future time. Using the equations (2.1-2.3), we
get,

S=0

I=0

= αI ≥ 0.
V =0

Thus all the above rates are non-negative on the bounding planes (given by S = 0, I = 0,
and V = 0) of the non-negative region of the real space. So, if a solution begins in the
interior of this region, it will remain inside it throughout time t. This happens because
the direction of the vector field is always in the inward direction on the bounding planes
as indicated by the above inequalities. Hence, we conclude that all the solutions of the the
system (2.1-2.3) remain positive for any time t > 0 provided that the initial conditions
are positive. This establishes the positivity of the solutions of the system (2.1-2.3). Next
we will show that the solution is bounded.
Boundedness: Let N (t) = S(t) + I(t) + V (t)

LOCAL DYNAMICS AND GLOBAL DYNAMICS OF THE MODEL 1
In the following we discuss the local stability analysis of the infection free equilibrium E0
and infected equilibrium E1 .

Now from the definition of R0 (3.1) we get,

3 NATURAL HISTORY, THE COURSE OF THE INFECTION AND ITS

βαω − µ(x + µ)(y + µ1 )y = µ(R0 − 1)(x + µ)(y + µ1 )

Using the relation (3.3) the roots of the quadratic part of equation (3.2), are given by,

λ2,3 = A ±

p
A2 + 4(R0 − 1)D

where,

A = (x + y + µ + µ1 )
and
D = (x + µ)(µ1 + y)

There are two cases that we need to consider here.

case I: When R0 < 1
When R0 < 1 there are further two subcases,

(a): A2 + 4(R0 − 1)D > 0

(b): A2 + 4(R0 − 1)D < 0

Sub-case (a): When A2 + 4(R0 − 1)D > 0, both the eigenvalues λ2,3 are negative,

λ2,3 = A ±

p

A2 + 4(R0 − 1)D < 0

Hence all the eigen values of the characteristics equation (3.2) are negative. Therefore
the infection free equilibrium point E0 is asymptotically stable.

9

3 NATURAL HISTORY, THE COURSE OF THE INFECTION AND ITS
DYNAMICS
Sub-case (b): When A2 + 4(R0 − 1)D < 0 the eigenvalues of the quadratic part of
equation (3.2) are complex conjugates with the negative real parts. Therefore we again
have E0 to be locally asymptotically stable.

Hence we conclude that E0 is locally asymptotically stable provided R0 < 1
case II: When R0 > 1
For the case R0 > 1, the characteristics equation (3.2) has two negative eigenvalues and
one positive eigenvalue. Therefore whenever R0 > 1 the infection free equilibrium E0 is
unstable.

STABILITY ANALYSIS OF E1
With the definition of R0 (3.1) the infected equilibrium is given by,

E1 = (S ∗ , I ∗ , B ∗ )
where,

S∗ =

Therefore the infected equilibrium exists only if R0 > 1, otherwise E1 will become negative which does not make sense.

where p = x + y + µ + µ1 and q = (x + µ)(µ1 + y).

Since R0 > 1, (p + µR0 ) > 0, (pµR0 ) > 1 and qµ(R0 − 1) > 0 (because R0 > 1 for E1 to
exists). Therefore if we substitute λ = −k in equation (3.4) using Descartes rule of sign
change we get all the roots of (3.4) to be negative. Hence we conclude that the infected
equilibrium point E1 exists and remains asymptotically stable provided R0 > 1.

GLOBAL DYNAMICS OF THE MODEL 1

GLOBAL STABILITY OF E0
To establish the global stability of the infection free equilibrium E0 we make use of the
method discussed in Castillo-Chavez et al [7].

Theorem 3.1. Consider the following general system,

dX
= F (X, Y )
dt
dY
= G(X, Y )
dt

(3.5)

where X denotes the uninfected population compartments and Y denotes the infected
population compartments including latent, infectious etc. Here the function G is such
11

3 NATURAL HISTORY, THE COURSE OF THE INFECTION AND ITS
DYNAMICS

that it satisfies G(X, 0) = 0. Let U0 = (X0 , 0̄) denote the equilibrium point of the above
general system.
If the following two conditions are satisfied then the infection free equilibrium point U0 is
globally asymptotically stable for the above general system provided R0 < 1
A1 : For the subsystem

dX
dt

= F (X, 0), X0 is globally asymptotically stable.

b
A2 : The function G = G(X, Y ) can be written as G(X, Y ) = AY − G(X,
Y ), where
c
Gj (X, Y ) ≥ 0 ∀ (X, Y ) in the biologically feasible region Ω for j=1,2 and A = DY G(X, Y )
at (X0 , 0̄) is a M-matrix(matrix with non-negative off diagonal element).

Now we will prove the global stability of E0 = ( ωµ , 0, 0) of system (2.1-2.3) by showing
that system (2.1-2.3) can be written as the above general form and both the conditions
A1 and A2 are satisfied .

Comparing the above general system (3.5) to the system (2.1 - 2.3) the functions F and
G are given by
F (X, Y ) = ω − βSV − µS


G(X, Y ) = βV S − (x + µ)I, αI − (y + µ1 )V

where X = S and Y = (I, V )
The disease free equilibrium point is U0 = (X0 , 0̄), where,
X0 =

ω
µ

and 0̄ = (0, 0)

From the stability analysis of E0 , we know that U0 is locally asymptotically stable iff
R0 < 1. Clearly, we see that G(X, 0̄) = (0, 0̄). Now, we show that X0 = ( ωµ ) is globally
asymptotically stable for the subsystem
dS

Thus both the assumptions A1 and A2 are satisfied and therefore infection free equilibrium
point E0 is globally asymptotically stable provided R0 < 1.

3. αI ∗ = (y + µ1 )V ∗

Thus

Hence by Lyapunov Lasalle theorem [25], the infected equilibrium E1 is globally asymptotically stable.

BIFURCATION ANALYSIS
In this section we use the method given by Chavez and Song in [8] to do the bifurcation
analysis.
Theorem 3.2. Consider a system,
dX
= f (X, φ)
dt
where X ∈ Rn , φ ∈ R is the bifurcation parameter and f : Rn × R → Rn where f ∈
C2 (Rn , R). Let 0̄ be the equilibrium point of the system such that f (0̄, φ) = 0̄, ∀ φ ∈ R.
Let the following conditions hold :

Then local dynamics of the system near the equilibrium point 0̄ is totally determined by
the signs of a and b. Here are the following conclusions :

1. If a > 0 and b > 0, then whenever φ < 0 with | φ | 1, the equilibrium 0̄ is
locally asymptotically stable, and moreover there exists a positive unstable equilibrium. However when 0 < φ  1, 0̄ is an unstable equilibrium and there exists a
negative and locally asymptotically stable equilibrium.
2. If a < 0, b < 0, then whenever φ < 0 with | φ  1, 0̄ is an unstable equilibrium
whereas if 0 < φ  1, 0̄ is locally asymptotically stable equilibrium and there exists
a positive unstable equilibrium.
3. If a > 0, b < 0, then whenever φ < 0 with | φ | 1, 0̄ is an unstable equilibrium,
and there exists a locally asymptotically stable negative equilibrium. However if
0 < φ  1, 0̄ is stable, and a there appears a positive unstable equilibrium.
4. If a < 0, b > 0, then whenever φ changes its value from negative to positive,
the equilibrium 0̄ changes its stability from stable to unstable. Correspondingly a
negative equilibrium, unstable in nature, becomes positive and locally asymptotically
stable.

Applying the Theorem 3.2 to our Model 1 :
In our case, we have x = (S, I, B) ∈ R3 where x1 = S, x2 = I and x3 = V . Let us
consider β (transmission rate of the infection) to be the bifurcation parameter.

where p = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 and q =

Therefore we have,

With x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (S, I, V ) system (2.1 -2.3) can be written as follows :

with negative real parts. Thus, the condition 1 of the Theorem 3.2 is satisfied.

Next, for proving condition 2, we need to find the right and left eigenvectors of the zero
eigenvalue (λ2 ). Let us denote the right and left eigenvectors by u and v respectively.

We notice that condition (iv) of the theorem is satisfied. Hence, we conclude that the
system undergoes bifurcation at β = β ∗ implying R0 = 1.

Thus, we conclude that when R0 < 1, there exists a unique disease free equilibrium
which is globally asymptotically stable and negative infected equilibrium which is unstable . Since negative values of population is not practical, therefore we ignore it in this
case. Further, as R0 crosses unity from below, the disease free equilibrium point loses
its stable nature and become unstable, the bifurcation point being at β = β ∗ implying
R0 = 1 and there appears a positive locally asymptotically stable infected equilibrium

point. There is an exchange of stability between disease free equilibrium and infected
equilibrium at R0 = 1. Hence, a trans-critical bifurcation takes place at the break
point β = β ∗ .

PARAMETER ESTIMATION
We now numerically depict and verify the results obtained in Local and Global dynamics
and Bifurcation Analysis sections. The theoretical results obtained are validated for a
set of model parameters using MATLAB software. The values of ω, µ and µ1 , α are
approximated and chosen to be from [24] and [12] respectively. The rest of the parameter
values of the model are estimated minimizing the root mean square difference between
the model predictive output and the experimental data from [13, 28]. All the parameter

For the above set of parameter values, R0 = 0.77 < 1. Since R0 < 1, we can say that
the disease free equilibrium point, E0 = (20, 0, 0) is globally asymptotically stable. The
following figures(1-2) shows the global stability of the infection free equilibrium E0 .

Figure 2 shows the global asymptotic stability of E0 = (20, 0, 0). It is obtained using
different initial conditions for the same set of the model parameters given in Table 2

In this section, we numerically show that as R0 crosses unity from below, there is an
exchange of stability between the disease free equilibrium and infected equilibrium. Here
the parameter ω is varied in the interval (0, 5) in steps of 0.1. The other parameters
chosen are given in the following table 5. As a result R0 varies in the interval (0, 3).

CHARACTERISTICS OF COVID-19 AND VALIDATION OF THE PROPOSED MODEL
The characteristic features of the disease Covid-19 are as follows:
(a) Target cells(monocytes) deplete to approximately 66 % to the original level (from
6x108 to 4x108 in severe cases) [28].

(b) The median incubation period of SARS-Cov-2 is approximately 4-5 days and peak
viremia occurs within 5-6 days of disease onset [29].

In this section we vary the parameters x = (d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 ) and y =
(b1 + b2 + b3 + b4 + b5 + b6 ) and do a two parameter heat plot to validate our model 1. The
parameters x and y were varied in the interval (0, 5) and model 1 was able to reproduce
both the above characteristic of the Covid-19. Other fixed parameter values were taken
from the following table 5.

We choose the parameters x and y in the x− axis and y− axis respectively and vary them
to check for reproduction of the characteristics (a) and (b).
In figure 5 model 1 is able to recover the first characteristic (a) exactly for the parameter
values in the region pointed by the arrow. In this region with yellow colour the final
fraction of uninfected cells after infection lies between (60 − 70)% and for the parameter
values in this region the model 1 is able to reproduce the first characteristic (a).
The region with yellow colour in figure 6 pointed by the arrow is the region where Model
1 is able to recover the second characteristics (b). From [29] the peak viremia occurs
approximately during the second week of disease onset. In figure 6 time to peak viremia
lies between 8-16 days and hence for the parameter values in this region Model 1 is able
to reproduce the second characteristics (b).

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
From the previous sections, it is clear that the infected cell population and the virus load
die out when R0 < 1. Therefore it is important to control the model parameters in a
manner which will make R0 less than one. Thus, determining the intervals in which the
model parameters are sensitive becomes vital. As each parameter is varied in different
intervals, the infected cell population, mean infected cell population and the mean square
error are plotted with respect to time. These plots are used to determine the sensitivity
of the parameter. The different intervals chosen are given in the following Table 6. For
all the plots in this section, the time scale is the following: x−axis: 10 units = 1 day, y−
axis: 1 unit = 1 cell.

OPTIMAL CONTROL PROBLEM
In this section, we will formulate an optimal control problem for the model 2 with drug
interventions as control. The controls to be considered are:

1. Drug intervention to boost immune response: The innate immune response
that is inherent in the human body is the first to counter and reduce the growth
of infected cells and viral load. In this intervention, we provide medication that
boosts this innate immune system. This is modelled using two controls based on
their role:

(b) Interval II

(c) Interval III

Figure 14. Sensitivity Analysis of µ1 . Infected cell population in different intervals.

(a) Control intervention that reduces the growth of the infected cells by releasing
the necessary cytokines and chemokines which act on these cells. We denote
this intervention by control variable u11 (t).
(b) Control intervention that reduces the the viral load by releasing the necessary
cytokines and chemokines. We denote this intervention by control variable
u12 (t).
2. Drug intervention to prevent viral replication: We know that one of the
main causes of severity of disease caused by viruses is their rapid replication in the
human body. We consider the intervention of providing medication that directly
acts on the virus cells and prevent its replication which in turn reduces the birth
rate of the virus. We use the control variable u2 (t) to denote this intervention.
The set of all admissible controls is given by

U = {(u11 (t), u12 (t), u2 (t)) : u11 (t) ∈ [0, u11 max], u12 (t) ∈ [0, u12 max], u2 (t) ∈ [0, u2 max], t ∈ [0, T ]}
Without medical interventions, u11 , u12 , and u2 are just constant parameters with
u2 = 0. u11 and u12 have some value based on the inherent release of these cytokines
and chemokines by the body. In the control problem, these variables are considered as

functions of time. The upper bounds of control variables are based on the resource limitation based on availability and the limit to which these drugs would be prescribed to
the patients.
Since these antiviral drugs administered are not inherently present in the human body
and being foreign particles to the body, there could be side effects once administered.
Also cost of these drugs could be an issue that needs to be addressed.
Based on these we now propose and define the optimal control problem with the goal to
reduce the cost functional

J(u11 (t), u12 (t), u2 (t)) =

The integrand of the cost function (4.1), denoted by
L(S, I, V, u11 , u12 , u2 ) = (I(t) + V (t) + A1 u11 (t)2 + A2 u12 (t)2 + A3 u2 (t)2 )
is called the Lagrangian or the running cost.
Here, the cost function represents the number of infected cells and viral load throughout
the observation period, and the side effects of the drug on the body. Effectively, we want
to minimize the infected cells and the virus load in the body with the optimal medication
that is also least harmful to the body. Since the drugs administered have multiple effects,
the non-linearity for the control variables in the objective become justified [15].
The admissible solution set for the Optimal Control Problem (4.1)-(4.2) is given by

Ω = {(S, I, V, u11 , u12 , u2 ) | S, I and V that satisfy (4.2), ∀ u ∈ U }
EXISTENCE OF OPTIMAL CONTROL
We will show the existence of optimal control functions that minimize the cost functions
within a finite time span [0, T ] showing that we satisfy the conditions stated in Theorem
4.1 of [14].
Theorem 4.1. There exists a 3-tuple of optimal controls (u∗11 (t), u∗12 (t), u∗2 (t)) in the set
of admissible controls U such that the cost functional is minimized i.e.,

J[u∗11 (t), u∗12 (t), u∗2 (t)]

=

J[u11 , u12 , u2 ]

corresponding to the optimal control problem (4.1)-(4.2).
Proof. In order to show the existence of optimal control functions, we will show that the
following conditions are satisfied :
1. The solution set for the system (4.2) along with bounded controls must be nonempty, i.e., Ω 6= φ.
34

4 DRUG INTERVENTIONS AND OPTIMAL CONTROL STUDIES

2. U is closed and convex and system should be expressed linearly in terms of the
control variables with coefficients that are functions of time and state variables.

3. The Lagrangian L should be convex on U and L(S, I, V, u11 , u12 , u2 ) ≥ g(u11 , u12 , u2 ),
where g(u11 , u12 , u2 ) is a continuous function of control variables such that |(u11 , u12 , u2 )|−1 g(u11 , u12
∞ whenever |(u11 , u12 , u2 )| → ∞, where |.| is an l2 (0, T ) norm.
Now we will show that each of the conditions are satisfied :
1. From Positivity and boundedness of solutions of the system(4.2), all solutions are
bounded for each bounded control variable in U.
Also,the right hand side of the system (4.2) satisfies Lipschitz condition with respect to
state variables.
Hence, using the positivity and boundedness condition and the existence of solution from
Picard-Lindelof Theorem[23], we have satisfied condition 1.
2. U is closed and convex by definition. Also, the system (4.2) is clearly linear with
respect to controls such that coefficients are only state variables or functions dependent
on time. Hence condition 2 is satisfied.
3. Choosing g(u11 , u12 , u2 ) = c(u211 + u212 + u22 ) such that c = min {A1 , A2 , A3 }, we can
satisfy the condition 3.
Hence there exists a control 3-tuple (u∗11 , u∗12 , u∗2 ) ∈ U that minimizes the cost function
(4.1).
CHARACTERIZATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL
We will obtain the necessary conditions for optimal control functions using the Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle [19] and also obtain the characteristics of the optimal controls.
The Hamiltonian for this problem is given by

H(S, I, V, u11 , u12 , u2 , λ) := L(S, I, V, u11 , u12 , u2 ) + λ1

dS

+ λ2

Here λ = (λ1 ,λ2 ,λ3 ) is called co-state vector or adjoint vector.
Now the Canonical equations that relate the state variables to the co-state variables are
given by

(4.4)

along with transversality conditions λ1 (T ) = 0, λ2 (T ) = 0, λ3 (T ) = 0.
Now, to obtain the optimal controls, we will use the Hamiltonian minimization condition
∂H
= 0 , at ui = u∗i for i = 11, 12 , 2.

Differentiating the Hamiltonian and solving the equations, we obtain the optimal controls

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS
In this section, we perform numerical simulations to understand the efficacy of multiple
drug interventions. This is done by studying the effect of control on the dynamics of the
system. These simulations also validate the theoretical results obtained in the previous
section.
The various combinations of controls considered are:
1. Providing medication that only boosts the innate immune system by reducing the
number of infected cells and viral load.
2. Providing medication and treatment that only prevents viral replication.
36

4 DRUG INTERVENTIONS AND OPTIMAL CONTROL STUDIES

3. Providing medication and treatment that execute both the above.
For our simulations, we have taken the total number of days as T = 30. The parameter
values considered are as follows : ω = 10, µ= 0.05, µ1 = 1.1, β = 0.005, α = 0.5
We first solve the state system numerically using Fourth Order Runge-Kutta method in
MATLAB without any interventions. We take the initial values of state variables to be
S(0) = 3.2 × 105 , I(0) = 0, V (0) = 5.2 [5, 12] with the control parameters as constant
values u11 = 0.8866, u12 = 0.56, u2 = 0.
Now, to simulate the system with controls, we use the Forward-Backward Sweep method
stating with the initial values of controls and solve the state system forward in time.
Following this we solve the adjoint state system backward in time due to the transversality
conditions, using the optimal state variables and initial values of optimal control.
Now, using the values of adjoint state variables, the values of optimal control are updated
and with these updated control variables, we go through this process again. We continue
this till the convergence criterion is met [19]. The positive weights chosen for objective
coefficients are A1 = 80, A2 = 80, A3 = 7480. A3 is chosen high compared to A1 and
A2 as the effort to stop the viral replication process is higher than the effort to enhance
innate immune response as it is already existing in human body.

Figure 15. S, I, V without controls

Figure 15 shows the change in the cell population S(t), I(t), V (t) respectively with time.
We observed that the susceptible cells reduce and the infected cells increase exponentially
due to the increase in viral load over a period of time.
Figure 16 shows the behaviour of susceptible cells under all possible combinations of
control. We observe that in the presence of immune boosting medication only, there is
a slight reduction in the number of susceptible cells getting infected by the virus but
when viral replication is prevented the impact is more. Even lesser damage is seen on
37

4 DRUG INTERVENTIONS AND OPTIMAL CONTROL STUDIES

susceptible cells when all control interventions are applied together.

Figure 17. I under optimal controls u∗1 , u∗2

In figure 17 the first frame shows how infected cells grow or decay with various combinations of controls. The increase in infected cells is slightly lesser in the presence of
immunity boosters. There is a huge difference if viral replication preventing medicines are
used. Here too, the best results are obtained only when all the controls are applied. The
second frame in figure 17 gives detailed view of the cases when only antiviral replication
medicines are used and all 3 controls are used. We see that when only control u2 is used,
the infected cells increase slowly, and reduce later but increase again after 20 days. This
may be harmful to the patient. When all 3 controls are used, the infected cells reach
peak around the 8th day and start decaying then on and even become nearly zero after
30 days.
In figure 18 the first frame shows the viral load under all combinations of control interventions. When no medication is provided, there is exponential increase in the viral
load but when only immunity boosting medication is provided (u2 = 0), there is a little
reduction seen in the increase of viral load. The combinations of both these drug inter38

5 DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

ventions show much better results. From the second frame in figure 18 it can be seen
that when only anti-viral replication medication is provided (u11 = u12 = 0), the viral
load becomes very less by the 5th day but due to the absence of immunity boosters, the
viral load tends to increase around 25th day. The best results are shown when all the
control interventions are administered together. The detailed view of the figure explains
how the viral population tends to become nearly zero around 7th day and remains there
throughout. These results are in line with the clinical findings discussed in [6].
Thus the optimal control studies and the numerical simulations help us to infer the
following :
1. Innate immunity boosters do affect the way infection spreads in the body but they
become effective only along with the prevention of viral replication medicines.
2. Viral replication, when prevented, reduces the infected cells and the viral load drastically but the immune system needs to be sufficiently boosted if we want to completely
cure the patient.
3. When all controls are used effectively, then the patient can be cured completely, with
minimal/optimal dosage of drugs which minimizes the side effects caused to the patient
when administered.
5 DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
The outbreak of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China marked the introduction of a virulent coronavirus into human society. On Feb. 11, 2020, the World Health Organization
named novel corona viral pneumonia induced disease as Coronavirus disease (COVID19), which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Soon this grew into a global pandemic. As on 02 May 2020, 2, 37, 996 people lost their
lives and more than 33 lakh people have been affected due to COVID-19 all over the
world [4]. Although a lot of research is being done, effective approaches to treatment and
39

5 DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

epidemiological control are still lacking.
In this context, the invivo mathematical modelling studies can be extremely helpful in
understanding the efficacy of the drug interventions. These studies also can be helpful
in understanding the role of the crucial inflammatory mediators and the behaviour of
immune response towards this novel corona virus. Motivated by these facts, in this
paper, we study the invivo dynamics of Covid-19.
Based on the pathogenesis of Covid-19, we have proposed two models. The first model
deals with natural history and the course of infection while the second model incorporates
the drug interventions. The results of these studies show that the disease system admits
two steady states: one being the disease free equilibrium and the other being the infected
equilibrium. The dynamics of the system show that the disease takes it course to one of
these states based on the reproduction number R0 . Specifically when R0 < 1 the system
tends to stabilize around the disease free equilibrium and when R0 > 1 the system tends
to stabilize around the infected equilibrium. The system also undergoes a trans-critical
bifurcation at R0 = 1. This result is inline with the conclusions made at the population
level for Covid-19 [16]. From the sensitivity analysis it is seen that the burst rate of
virus particles and the natural death rate of the virus are sensitive parameters of the
system. From the sensitivity analysis it is seen that the burst rate of virus particles
and the natural death rate of the virus are the sensitive parameters of the system. We
also validate the proposed model 1 using two-parameter heat plots that reproduce the
characteristics of Covid-19.
Results from the optimal control studies suggest that the antiviral drugs that target on
viral replication and the drugs that enhance the immune system response both reduce the
infected cells and viral load when taken individually. In particular, the antiviral drugs
that target viral replication seem to yield better results than the drugs that enhance the
innate immune response. From figure 18, it can be seen that on administering control
intervention u2 there is a substantial decrease in the viral load from day 2. This result
validates the clinical findings in [6] which states that "Ivermectin, an FDA-approved
anti-parasitic previously shown to have broad-spectrum anti-viral activity in vitro, is an
inhibitor of the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2), with a single addition to Vero-hSLAM
cells 2 h post infection with SARS-CoV-2 able to effect 5000-fold reduction in viral RNA
at 48 h."
When applied in combination, these drugs yield the best possible results. Hence, the
optimal control strategy and the best drug regime would be to use the combination of
both these drugs which help in patient’s recovery with minimal/optimal dosage that
reduce the side effects caused due to these drugs.

6 FUTURE RESEARCH
This work is an initial attempt to understand the basic dynamics of Covid-19 and its
course. The consequences and the outcomes of the two main functions of antiviral drug
interventions is modelled and discussed. Further research can be focused on incorporating
the side effects of these drugs into the model. Future studies can also focus on the various
other drug interventions along with their effects on Covid-19 dynamics.
