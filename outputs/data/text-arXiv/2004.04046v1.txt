Abstract

spread, allegedly from a bat or pangolin, to essentially every
country in the world, resulting in over 1M cases of COVID-19
and 50K deaths as of April 2, 2020 [45].
Humanity has taken unprecedented steps to mitigating the
spread of SARS-CoV-2, enacting social distancing measures
that go against our very nature. While the repercussions of social distancing measures are yet to be fully understood, one
thing is certain: the Web has not only proven essential to the
approximately normal continuation of daily life, but also as a
tool by which to ease the pain of isolation.
Unfortunately, just like the spread of COVID-19 was accelerated in part by international travel enabled by modern technology, the connected nature of the Web has enabled the spread
of misinformation [44], conspiracy theories [28], and racist
rhetoric [30]. Considering society’s recent struggles with online
racism (often leading to violence), and the politically charged
environment coinciding with SARS-CoV-2’s emergence, there
is every reason to believe that a wave of Sinophobia is not just
coming, but already upon us.
In this paper, we present an analysis of how online Sinophobia has emerged and evolved as the COVID-19 crisis has
unfolded. To do this, we collect and analyze two large-scale
datasets obtained from Twitter and 4chan’s Politically Incorrect
board (/pol/). Using temporal analysis, word embeddings, and
graph analysis, we shed light on the prevalence of Sinophobic
behavior on these communities, how this prevalence changes
over time as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, and more importantly, we investigate whether there are substantial differences in discussions related to Chinese people by comparing
the behavior pre- and post- COVID-19 crisis.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives
in unprecedented ways. In the face of the projected catastrophic
consequences, many countries have enacted social distancing
measures in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus. Under these conditions, the Web has become an indispensable
medium for information acquisition, communication, and entertainment. At the same time, unfortunately, the Web is being exploited for the dissemination of potentially harmful and
disturbing content, such as the spread of conspiracy theories
and hateful speech towards specific ethnic groups, in particular
towards Chinese people since COVID-19 is believed to have
originated from China.
In this paper, we make a first attempt to study the emergence
of Sinophobic behavior on the Web during the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic. We collect two large-scale datasets from
Twitter and 4chan’s Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) over a
time period of approximately five months and analyze them to
investigate whether there is a rise or important differences with
regard to the dissemination of Sinophobic content. We find that
COVID-19 indeed drives the rise of Sinophobia on the Web and
that the dissemination of Sinophobic content is a cross-platform
phenomenon: it exists on fringe Web communities like /pol/,
and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like Twitter. Also,
using word embeddings over time, we characterize the evolution and emergence of new Sinophobic slurs on both Twitter
and /pol/. Finally, we find interesting differences in the context
in which words related to Chinese people are used on the Web
before and after the COVID-19 outbreak: on Twitter we observe a shift towards blaming China for the situation, while on
/pol/ we find a shift towards using more (and new) Sinophobic
slurs.

Main findings. Among others, we make the following findings:
1. We find a rise in discussions related to China and Chinese
people on Twitter and 4chan’s /pol/ after the outbreak of
the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, we observe a
rise in the use of specific Sinophobic slurs, primarily on
/pol/ and to a lesser extent on Twitter. Also, by comparing
our findings to real-world events, we find that the increase
in these discussions and Sinophobic slurs coincides with
real-world events related to the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic.
2. Using word embeddings, we looked into the context of
words used in discussions referencing Chinese people
finding that various racial slurs are used in these contexts

Introduction

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the
largest pandemic event of the information age. SARS-CoV-2 is
thought to have originated in China, with the presumed ground
zero centered around a wet market in the city of Wuhan in
the Hubei province [50]. In a few months, SARS-CoV-2 has
1

on both Twitter and /pol/. This indicates that Sinophobic
behavior is a cross-platform phenomenon existing in both
fringe Web communities like /pol/ and mainstream ones
like Twitter.
3. Using word embeddings over time, we discover new
emerging slurs and terms related to Sinophobic behavior,
as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, on /pol/
we observe the emergence of the term “kungflu” after January, 2020, while on Twitter we observe the emergence of
the term “asshoe,” which aims to make fun of the accent
of Chinese people speaking English.
4. By comparing our dataset pre- and post-COVID-19 outbreak, we observe shifts in the content posted by users on
Twitter and /pol/. On Twitter, we observe a shift towards
blaming China and Chinese people about the outbreak,
while on /pol/ we observe a shift towards using more, and
new, Sinophobic slurs.

tor embeddings, they found that male and younger users (under
35) are more likely to engage in racism on Twitter.
Other work performed quantitative studies to characterize
hateful users on social media, analyzing their language and
their sentiment [9, 40]. In particular, it focused on discrimination and hate directed against women, for example as part of
the Pizzagate conspiracy [8, 11].
Remarks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first datadriven study on the evolution of racist rhetoric against Chinese
people and people of Asian descent in light of the COVID-19
pandemic.

To study the extent and evolution of Sinophobic behavior on
the Web, we collect and analyze two large-scale datasets from
Twitter and 4chan’s Politically Incorrect board (/pol/).

Disclaimer. Note that content posted on the Web communities
we study is likely to be considered as highly offensive or racist.
Throughout the rest of this paper, we do not censor any language, thus we warn the readers that content presented is likely
to be offensive and upsetting.

Datasets

Twitter. Twitter is a popular mainstream microblog used by
millions of users for disseminating information. To obtain data
from Twitter, we leverage the Streaming API1 , which provides
a 1% random sample of all tweets made available on the platform. We collect tweets posted between November 1, 2019 and
March 22, 2020, and then we filter only the ones posted in English, ultimately collecting 222,212,841 tweets.

Related Works

4chan’s /pol/. 4chan is an imageboard that allows the anonymous posting of information. The imageboard is divided into
several sub-communities called boards: each board has its own
topic of interest and moderation policy. In this work, we focus
on the Politically Incorrect board (/pol/), simply because it is
the main board for the discussion of world events. To collect
data, we use the data collection approach from Hine et al. [23],
to collect all posts made on /pol/ between November 1, 2019
and March 22, 2020. Overall, we collect 16,808,191 posts.

Due to its incredible impact to everybody’s life in early 2020,
the COVID-19 pandemic has already attracted the attention of
researchers. In particular, a number of papers studied how users
on social media discussed this emergency. Chen et al. [10] release a dataset of 50M tweets related to the pandemic. Cinelli
et al. [12], Singh et al. [41], and Kouzy et al. [31] studied misinformation narratives about COVID-19 on Twitter. Lopez et
al. [32] analyzed a multi-language Twitter dataset to understand
how people in different countries reacted to policies related to
COVID-19.
A number of papers studied racist activity on social networks. Keum and Miller [29] argued that racism on the Internet is pervasive and that users are likely to encounter it. Zimmerman et al. [56] focused on the influence that the anonymity
brought by the Internet has on the likelihood for people to take
part in online aggression. Relia et al. [39] found that racist online activity correlates with hate crimes. In other words, users
located in areas with higher occurrence of hate crimes are
more likely to engage in racism on social media. Yang and
Counts [53] studied how users who experienced racism on Reddit self-narrate their experience. They characterize the different
types of racism experienced by users with different demographics, and show that commiseration is the most valued form of
social support.
Zannettou et al. [55] present a quantitative approach to understand racism targeting Jewish people online. As part of their
analysis, they present a method to quantify the evolution of
racist language based on word embeddings, similar to the technique presented in this paper. Hasanuzzaman et al. [22] investigated how demographic traits of Twitter users can act as a predictor of racist activity. By modeling demographic traits as vec-

Remarks. We elect to focus on these two specific Web communities, as we believe that they are representative examples of
both mainstream and fringe Web communities. That is, Twitter
is a popular mainstream community that is used by hundreds
of millions of users around the globe, while 4chan’s /pol/ is a
notorious fringe Web community that is known for the dissemination of hateful or weaponized information [23].

Temporal Analysis

We start our analysis by studying the temporal dynamics of
words related to “china” and “chinese” on 4chan’s /pol/ and
Twitter. Also, we investigate the prevalence of several racial
slurs targeted towards Chinese and Asian people.

on 4chan’s /pol/ on a daily base. We also annotate (with vertical lines) real-world events related to the COVID-19 pandemic
(see Table 1 for more details).
We first observe a sudden increase for both words around
January 23, 2020, the day the Chinese government officially
locked down the city of Wuhan marking the first large-scale
effort in China to combat COVID-19.2 After the Wuhan lockdown, the popularity of “china” and “chinese” declines until
the latter part of February, right around the time that COVID19 cases started to appear en masse in Europe.
On February 24, 2020 (annotation 4 in the figure), 11 municipalities in Lombardy, Italy were put on lock-down in an
attempt to slow the explosion of community spread cases, and
we start to see the use of “china” and “chinese” slightly rise
again. This rate increases dramatically around March 9, 2020
(annotation 5), which is when the Italian government extended
the lock-down to the entirety of Italy. The second peak comes
around March 16, 2020, when Donald Trump referred COVID19 as “Chinese Virus” in a tweet. Interestingly, after this event,
we observe a peak in activity where around 10% of all posts
made on /pol/ are related to China (see Figure 1).
On Twitter (see Figure 2) we see the same high level trend:
discussion about “china” and “chinese” has a large up tick
when Wuhan is locked down, and then declines until COVID19 hits Europe. There is one important difference however. The
amount of relative discussion on Twitter during the first peak
is much lower than the level of discussion once Europe comes
into play. This may be due to the fact that discussion on Twitter
is more geographically distributed, or that 4chan’s /pol/ is more
easily inflamed by conspiracies and racism-related posts. Social

distance may work as one factor in illustrating the gap between
two peaks. Referring to the perception of others [48, 6, 1, 14],
this perception can be elevated by a familiarity of cultural, nationality, ethics, education, occupation, etc. Geographically intimacy, as well as close cultural background, leads to higher
attention on COVID-19 outbreak in Europe than the lock-down
in Wuhan.

Racial Slurs

Besides “china” and “chinese,” we also analyze the temporal
dynamics of Sinophobic racial slurs on 4chan’s /pol/ and Twitter. We pick a set of 8 Sinophobic slurs, including “chink,”
“bugland,” “chankoro,” “chinazi,” “gook,” “insectoid,” “bugmen,” and “chingchong.”3 Some of them are well-known racial
slurs towards Chinese and Asian people [51], such as “chink,”
“chingchong,” and “gook.” Others (e.g., “bugland”) are based
on preliminary results where we used word embeddings to discover other racial slurs (see Section 5 for more details).
The results are depicted in Figure 3 and 4 for /pol/ and
Twitter, respectively. For /pol/, we observe a general trend that
is similar with the trend observed before for the mentions of
“china” and “chinese” (see Figure 1). That is, we observe two
main peaks of activity around January 23, and March 16, 2020,
for most of the slurs. In particular, it is worrisome that the use
of most slurs keeps increasing after the event where Donald
Trump referred to COVID-19 as “Chinese Virus.” By looking
at some posts on /pol/ posted after March 16, 2020, we find
several worrisome examples of hateful rhetoric that call for violence: e.g., “I really hope the world gets together to exterminate

The COVID-19 name was not chosen by the World Health Organization
(WHO) until a few weeks later on February 11, 2020 [35].

that for the slur “chingchong,” we search for both “chingchong” and
“ching chong.”

every last Chink on this planet.” and “Seconded, every chink
needs to exterminated, the yellow Jew needs to be erased from
this world.” When looking at the popularity of these terms, we
find that “chink” is the most popular Sinophobic slur on /pol/
with an order of magnitude more posts compared to other slurs
like “gook” and “chingchong.”
On Twitter (see Figure 4), we observe a rise of Sinophobic
slurs during December 2019, especially for “chink.” By manually examining the peak, we find that this happens because
of a tweet that went viral including the slur “chink.”4 Apart
from this outlier, we observe an increase in the use of Sinophobic slurs after January 23; again the increase in the use of
these slurs is lower than the one observed on /pol/ (cf. Figure 3
and 4). By the end of our dataset, we observe a substantial increase in the use of the slur “chingchong.” Looking at some
examples of tweets including this specific term, we find several
hateful comments: e.g., “All because Ching Chong had to chow
a fucking frog raw for lunch. #coronavirussafety” and “...Fuck
you’d just do to me you little shit I’ll break your fucking neck
fucking ching chong corona viru...”.
Finally, to better visualize the rise of Sinophobic slurs, we
show the number of posts including any of the eight identified
slurs posted after January 1, 2020, in Figure 5. Overall, we observe a rise in Sinophobic slurs, mainly on /pol/, and to a lesser
extent on Twitter. Despite this fact, we observe a substantial increase on Twitter on March 16, 2020. In a nutshell, these findings indicate that Sinophobic behavior is on the rise and that it
is a cross-platform phenomenon.

4.3

considering that /pol/ is well known to be a locus of racist ideology, however it is worthwhile discussing some of the theory
around why it tracks so well. The clearly racist reaction fits the
notion of defensive denial, which is a common strategy for coping with stress [3, 17, 24, 27, 42]. Essentially, the early stages
of COVID-19 were exclusively a Chinese problem; “superior”
Western society had nothing to worry about, even though experts were warning of a pandemic breakout even before Wuhan
was locked down. This conforms with the scapegoating theory
of clinical psychology, in which members of a group project unwanted self aspects onto another person or group, then attack
the scapegoat believing that “this is not me” [13, 18, 38]. Political scientists have argued that scapegoating is a major driver
for racism in a number of settings [15, 37].

Content Analysis
Method

To analyze the content, more specifically the context of the use
of specific words, we train multiple word2vec models [33] for
each Web community. In a nutshell, these models map words
into a high-dimensional vector space so that words that are used
in a similar way are close to each other. To do this, we leverage
the skip-gram model, which is a shallow neural network aiming
to predict the context of a specific word. In this work, we train
three groups of word2vec models for each of Twitter and /pol/:
1. One word2vec model (WA ) trained on all posts made during the period between October 28, 2019 and March 22,
2020. We denote the period by T . This model allows us to
study the use of words for the entire duration of our study.
2. One distinct word2vec model for each week between October 28, 2019 and March 22, 2020, denoted by Wt=i , i ∈
T (i is the ith week in T ). These models allow us to study
changes in the use of words over time.
3. One word2vec model trained on historical data for all
posts shared between July 1, 2016 and November 1, 2019
(WC ). This model acts as a baseline and allows us to investigate the emergence of new terms during the period of
our study.

Discussion

A common theme among racist ideology is that of an invading
virus. History is rife with examples of diseases being attributed
to specific races and nationalities, and there is no reason to believe that COVID-19 would buck this trend; the first identified
COVID-19 cases did originate in China. However, the world today is much more diverse and connected than it was in the 15th
century when Italians dubbed syphilis the “French disease.”
Figure 1 and 2 make it quite clear that 4chan and Twitter are
heavily discussing China in relation to COVID-19, and that this
discussion accelerated rapidly once the Western world became
affected. The upswing is potentially related to the scapegoating phenomenon [47] The first cases originated in China, and
the Chinese government was the first to take active and serious
measures to combat its spread prompting a reasonable degree of
discussion. When these measures were ineffective in preventing the spread to the Western world, however, China’s existing
association with COVID-19, in particular China’s “failure” to
prevent its spread make it a just scapegoat [2] in the face of a
looming pandemic.
That said, we do see meaningful differences in the use of
slurs on /pol/ and Twitter. /pol/’s use of slurs tracks with the use
of “china” and “chinese” to a worrying degree, but this is much
less pronounced on Twitter. This is not entirely unsurprising

5.2

Exploring the Context of Terms

First, we look into the overall use of words on 4chan’s /pol/ using the word2vec model trained on the period between October
28, 2019 and March 22, 2020 (WA ). In this model, words used
in similar context will present similar vectors. The left side of
Table 2 reports the top 20 most similar words for the terms
“china,” “chinese,” and “virus.” We make several observations:
first, we note that there are many derogatory terms for Asian
people, Chinese people in particular, in the top 20 most similar terms. Some examples include “chink” (derogatory term
referring to Asian people), “chinkland” (referring to the land of
chinks, i.e., China), and “chiniggers” (an offensive word created by combining “china” and “nigger”). For instance, a /pol/
user posted: “We should have never let these Chiniggers into
the country or enforced a mandatory quarantine for anyone

4 https://twitter.com/GoAwayWithJae/status/1203860502444748800,

which, in
a nutshell, is the culmination of outrage against the h3h3 podcast’s opinion on
the K-pop music genre.

coming from contaminated areas. But it’s too late now.” Another /pol/ user posted: “You chinks deserve it, there’s no shithole of a country that could be as disgusting as chinkland.”
This indicates that /pol/ users use a wide variety of derogatory
terms to possibly disseminate hateful ideology towards Chinese
and Asian people. Second, by looking at the most similar words
of the term “virus,” we find several terms related to the COVID19 pandemic [50]. This is evident since the four most similar
words to the term “virus” are related to COVID-19, specifically,
“coronovirus,” “covid,” “coronavirus,” and “corona.” This indicates that the overall use of words in /pol/ is highly affected

by the COVID-19 pandemic, and this event is likely to cause
changes in the use of language by users.
The corresponding results for Twitter is shown on the right
side of Table 2. On Twitter we observe multiple politicalrelated terms that are similar to “china” and “chinese,” such
as “government” and “ccp” (Chinese Communist Party). Furthermore, we again observe, some potentially offensive terms
like “chinazi,” which indicates that the use of Sinophobic content is not limited to fringe Web communities like 4chan, and
it also exists in mainstream Web communities like Twitter.
Also, many terms that are similar to “virus” are also related to
6

COVID-19, such as “corona” and “coronavirus.” This indicates
Twitters users’ word usage are influenced by the COVID-19
pandemic as well.

5.3

When looking at the graph obtained for Twitter (see Figure 7), we observe an interesting community of terms (blue),
which includes words related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We observe a large number of words that are seemingly antiChina like the terms “makechinapay,” “blamechina,” and “chinaisasshoe.” At the same time, there are a lot of terms referring to the virus itself like “chinawuhanvirus,” “chinaflu,” and
“coronacontrol,” as well as a few terms that aim to support
Chinese people through this crisis like “staystrongchina.” For
example, a Twitter user posted: “How do you say Chi-com
asshoe? #ChinesePropaganda #ChinaLiedPeopleDied #ChinaVirus #WuhanCoronavirus.” The other communities on the
graph include various terms related to happenings in China and
other Asian countries/regions.

Visualizing the Similarity between the Use
of Terms

To better visualize the use of language related to Chinese people, we create graphs that visualize the use of words that are
similar to the term “chinese,” following the methodology by
Zannettou et al. [55]. In a nutshell, we create a graph where
nodes are words and an edge between the words exists if their
cosine similarity (obtained from the trained word2vec model)
is above a pre-defined threshold.5 We limit the graph into nodes
that are two hops away from a specific word of interest (in this
case “chinese”). Then, we perform various tasks for visualizing the graph. First, the graph is layed out in the graph space
with an algorithm that takes into account the weights of the
edges [26]. That is, words that have large cosine similarities
are layed out closer in the graph space. Second, the size of each
node is relative to the number of occurrences of the word in our
dataset. Third, we run the the Louvain community detection
method [5] on the graph and represent nodes that belong to the
same community with the same color. The resulting graphs are
depicted in Figure 6 and 7 for /pol/ and Twitter, respectively.
By inspecting the obtained communities of words in Figure 6, we observe several interesting themes around the use of
words related to “chinese.” First, we observe a community that
is highly related to the COVID-19 pandemic (blue community
on bottom right). Interestingly, within this community, we also
observe terms like “biowepon” (sic) and “bioattack,” likely indicating that /pol/ users are sharing probably false information
about the pandemic, for instance claiming that the whole pandemic is a “bioattack” from the Chinese on the Western world.
For example, a /pol/ user posted: “Anyone that doesn’t realize this is a Chinese bioweapon by now is either a brainlet
or a chicom noodle nigger.” Second, we observe two tightlyknit communities (red and yellow communities on left-side
of the graph) that appear to predominantly include derogatory
terms towards Asian, and in particular Chinese people. Some
of the words in these communities are “ricenigger,” “chinksect,” “chankoro,” “chinks,” “yellowniggers,” and “pindick.”
By looking at some examples of posts from /pol/ users, we
observe the use of these terms for disseminating hate: e.g.,
“Chang you useless ricenigger fuck off. Just call the bitch and
ask her youll see this is fucking ccp bs. ITS A FUCKING EXPERIMENTAL CHINK BIOWEP” and “I fucking hate chinks.
Stop spreading viruses everywhere you pindick cunts.” Interestingly, the most distant word in these communities is the word
“batsoup,” which is closer to the community related to COVID19 [44]. The rest of the communities in this graph are seemingly
related to China in general (purple community) and to other
countries in Asia (green community). Overall, this graph highlights that /pol/ users use a wide variety of derogatory terms to
characterize Chinese people.

5.4

Discussion

By taking a deeper look at profanities that appeared among
the terms, we can roughly divide them into two groups: one
is insults addressing Asian people, such as racist variations of
“china” and “chinese” (e.g., “chinkland,” “chingchong,” and
“chinksect”) or culturally oriented racist terms, including attacking dietary habits (e.g., “ricenigger”), skin tone (e.g., “yellownigger”), or sexual stereotypes (e.g., “pindick”). The frequent appearance of swear words among the terms can indicate
an abreaction to the rising fear and stress in front of the disease [21, 16]. At the same time, the racist and targeted focus of
these slurs can be explained with the mechanism of defensive
aggression, either focusing on cultural taboos, such as sexuality [16, 25], or perpetuating societal oppression [25].

6

Content Evolution

Discussions on Web communities like 4chan’s /pol/ and Twitter
are highly dynamic and respond to real-world events as they unfold. Thus, we expect users on these Web communities to discuss various topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, events like the COVID-19 pandemic unfold over time, and
this is reflected by the dynamics of discussion on Web communities.
In previous sections we explored both the usage of some key
terms related to Sinophobia, as well as a static understanding
of content. However, these previous analyses do not help us understand how Sinophobic language is evolving over time. More
specifically, there is a lack of understanding on how the context in which words are used changes, and also how new words
are created. The former is important because it provides significant insights into the scope and breadth of the problem. The
latter is important because the language of online extremism
has been shown to include memes and slang that have completely contradictory meanings to “normal” usage, or do not
even exist outside of the communities that use them. We first
study the Sinophobic language evolution on 4chan’s /pol/, and
in Section 6.2, we will focus on Twitter.

Evolution on 4chan’s /pol/

like “chink,” however, most of the other words relate to people originating from other Asian countries, such as “koreans.”
When looking at the most similar words to the term “virus,”
before the COVID-19 pandemic, we observe general terms related to diseases or other outbreaks, e.g., “ebola.”

To study the evolution of discussions and use of language, we
make use of the weekly word2vec models (Wt=i , i ∈ T ).
To illustrate how these models are helpful, we initially compare the results from the model trained on the first week of
our dataset (Wt=0 ) with the model trained on the last week of
our dataset (Wt=−1 ). Table 3 reports the top 20 similar words
to “china,” “chinese,” and “virus,” for the first and last weekly
word2vec models (similar to how Table 2 shows results for a
model trained on the entirety of our dataset). Interestingly, we
observe major differences between the most similar words obtained from the first and last models (comparing left sides of the
Table with the right side), as well as between the whole model
and these two weekly models (cf. Table 2 and Table 3).
We make several key observations. First, when looking at
the most similar words to the term “china” from the first week
model (left side of Table 3), we observe words referring to other
counties, mostly in Asia (e.g., “japan,” “singapore,” etc.), but
also that the derogatory term “chinks” is among the top 20.
This result indicates that 4chan’s /pol/ users typically use racial
slurs targeted to Chinese people, and this was also happening
even before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar
findings can be observed by looking at the most similar words
to the term “chinese.” We observe the existence of racial slurs

Second, by comparing the most similar words from the first
and last models, we observe several interesting differences. By
looking at the most similar words to the term “china,” we observe that derogatory terms like “chink” have a higher cosine
similarity compared to the first model, likely indicating a rise
in the use of this term in discussions related to China. Furthermore, we observe terms like “chernobyl,” which may indicate
that /pol/ users are comparing this outbreak with the Chernobyl
disaster. For example, a /pol/ user posted: “I can see China collapsing after all this, just as the Chernobyl incident was the beginning of the end for the USSR....” We also see the term “childkiller,” which upon manual investigation is due to a particularly
active user repeatedly posting that China created COVID-19
as a bioweapon. Specifically, we find multiple occurrences of
the following sentence in multiple /pol/ posts: “CHINA CREATED THE CHINA BIOWEAPON MURDER DEATH CHILDKILLER VIRUS IN CHINA!” Interestingly, we also find some
terms that seem to be sarcastic towards the way that Chinese
people talk English. For instance, the term “numba” refers to

Table 3: Top 20 most similar words to the words “china,” “chinese,” and “virus” for the first and last trained word2vec models
from 4chan’s /pol/.
/pol/ include: “I hope you fucking die in hell, you psychopathic zipperhead. You and your whole disgusting race” and
“We should unironically nuke China. Kill some bugpeople and
eradicate COVID-19 at the same time.”
Overall, these findings indicating that we are experiencing
an explosion in the use of Chinese derogatory terms in fringe
Web communities like 4chan’s /pol/, in particular after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are particularly worrisome, since it is likely that as the pandemic evolves,
it is likely to have further rise in the dissemination of racist and
hateful ideology towards Chinese people that might also have
real-world consequences, such as physical violence against
Chinese people.

the word “number” and “asshoe” refers to the term “asshole.”
Some examples from /pol/ posts are: “Dont trust China, China
is asshoe” and “TAIWAN NUMBA 1 CHINA NUMBA NONE!”
Third, by looking into the most similar words to the term
“chinese,” we observe the term “bioterrorism” likely indicating
that 4chan’s /pol/ users are calling Chinese people as bioterrorists that is likely related to conspiracy theories that COVID-19
was bioengineered. For example, a /pol/ user posted: “THIS IS
BIOTERRORISM NUKE CHINA NOW.” By looking at the most
similar words to the term “virus,” we find that the most similar
one is the term “bioengineered,” indicating that the conspiracy
theory went viral on /pol/ during that specific week and was
discussed extensively. For instance a /pol/ user posted: “The
bat soup is just a cover-up. One of (((Leiber)))’s chinks stole
the bioengineered virus & tried to patent it in China, violating
export-controlled laws & committing espionage. My guess is,
he didn’t handle the virus correctly, got himself sick, then infected others in the Wuhan wet market.” Finally, by looking at
the other similar words to the term “virus,” we clearly observe
those that are related to the COVID-19 pandemic with terms
like “wuflu” (created by combining Wuhan and Flu), “covid,”
and “corona.” For instance, a /pol/ user posted “Die to wuflu
already, boomers.”
These differences are also more evident by looking at the
graph visualizations in Figure 8. To create these graphs, we use
the same methodology as Figure 6, for the first and last weekly
trained word2vec models, visualizing the two-hop neighborhood of the term “chinese.” Looking at the graph obtained
from the first model (see Figure 8(a)), we observe mostly innocuous terms related to Chinese people and other Asian people. By looking at the graph obtained from the last model (see
Figure 8(b)), however, we observe an entirely different, more
hateful behavior. Specifically, the two main tightly-knit communities (red and blue communities), are filled with slurs used
against Chinese people like “ricenigger,” “fuckface,” “zipperhead,” “bugpeople,” “subhumans,” etc. Example of posts from

Discovering new terms. Next, we aim to study how new terms,
related to “chinese,” emerge on 4chan’s /pol/ and how their popularity changes over the course of our dataset. To achieve this,
we make use of the terms extracted from the vocabularies of
the trained word2vec models on 4chan’s /pol/. Specifically, we
initially extract the vocabulary from the model trained on historical data (WC ) and treat it as our base vocabulary. Then, for
each weekly trained model (Wt=i , i ∈ T ), we extract the vocabulary and compare the terms with our base vocabulary: for
each term that is new, we add it to our base vocabulary treat it
as a new term. Since, we want to find new terms that are related to Chinese, we filter out all new terms that have a cosine
similarity below 0.5 in the weekly trained model for which we
discovered the new term. Overall, using the above methodology, we manage to discover a total of 50 new terms. Then, we
visualize the popularity of the 20 most popular new terms of
the course of our dataset in Figure 9.
We observe the emergence of several interesting words during the the end of January, 2020. First, we observe the emergence of terms like “batsoup,” likely indicating that /pol/ users
are discussing the fact that the COVID-19 outbreak, allegedly
started by Chinese people consuming bats. Second, by the same

time, we observe the emergence of “biolab” and “biowarfare.”
The use of these words indicate that /pol/ users discuss various
conspiracy theories on how the COVID-19 virus was created
on a lab or how it can be used as a bioweapon. Interestingly,
these terms are persistent from their emergence till the end of
our datasets, indicating that these theories are generally appealing to 4chan’s userbase. Other interesting new terms include
the terms “kungflu,” which an offensive term towards Chinese

people related to the COVID-19 virus, and “heinsberg,” which
is the center of the outbreak in Germany and indicates that
/pol/ users was discussing about it, especially during the end
of February, 2020 and beginning of March, 2020.
The echo chamber effect [54] performs significantly on
4chan, that the narratives towards COVID-19 are consistently
blaming China, and being racist, or spreading conspiracy theory, which alarms for the risk of information manipulation

in context as well. For example, a Twitter user posted: “I agree.
Too specific. It’s obviously called the kungflu. It’s kicking all of
our asses regardless of denomination.”
Moreover, many terms with similar contexts to “china” and
“chinese” in our last week Twitter dataset are still about politics. In contrast to the first week Twitter data, these politicalrelated terms are related to COVID-19, e.g., “ccpvirus,” and
some of these terms even convey the meaning of revenge and
punishment towards China, such as “boycottchina.” For instance, a Twitter user posted: “#ChineseVirus is chinesevirus.
One name. #BoycottChina #ChinaLiesPeopleDie.”
By looking into the graphs obtained from the first and last
weekly trained word2vec models (see Figure 10) we again observe substantial differences between the first and last models.
The graph from the first model includes mainly words related
to China and other Asian regions, as well as words used for discussing matters related to China, e.g., “tradewar.” On the other
hand, for the graph obtained from the last model, we observe
several terms related to COVID-19 like “chinavirus,” “chinesevirus,” “chineseflu,” and “chinaisasshoe.” This indicates a shift
towards the use of racist terms related to Chinese people after the COVID-19 outbreak on Twitter. We also observe some
terms that appear related to the behavior of Donald Trump. For
instance, the term “racistinchief” is likely related to the fact that
Donald Trump calls the COVID-19 virus as “Chinese Virus,”
and this was discussed on Twitter. For instance, a Twitter user
posted: “Trumps a real asshole, just in case yall forget #TrumpPandemic #TrumpVirus #RacistInChief.”

a small number of zealots can distort collective decisions, especially on ambiguous events [52, 43].

Evolution on Twitter

Now, we focus on the Sinophobic language evolution on Twitter. We follow the same methodology used in Section 6.1. The
corresponding results are depicted in Table 4 and Figure 10.
From Table 4, we can observe that during the first week
covered by our Twitter dataset, many similar terms to “china”
and “chinese” are related to politics, such as “tradewar.” This
is again quite different from the result on /pol/ (see Table 3).
Meanwhile, for “virus,” the most similar terms are also related
to diseases.
However, when checking results on our last week Twitter
data, we observe that many Sinophobic terms appear to be semantically similar to “china” and “chinese,” such as “chinazi.”
As in 4chan’s /pol/ (see Table 3), newly created Sinophobic
terms, including “chinavirus” and “kungflu,” appear to be close

Discovering new terms. To discover new terms from Twitter,
we follow the same methodology with /pol/, as documented in
Section 6.1. Overall, we discover a total of 713 new terms between October 28, 2019 and March 22, 2020. Figure 11 visualizes a sample of 40 of the new terms according to their popularity and cosine similarity with the term “chinese.” We observe a lot of new terms relating to the Hong Kong protests
emerging during November 2019, such as “freehongk” and

“hongkongpoliceb.” Also, after the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic, we observe the emergence of a wide variety of terms
around the end of January 2020. Some notable examples include terms like “chinavirus,” “chinesevirus,” “wuhanpneumo-

important real-world events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,
language evolves and new terms emerge on Web communities
like Twitter. At the same time, it is particularly worrisome that

Cosine Similarity

(a) chinese - virus

Figure 12: Cosine similarities between various terms over time.
we observe the appearance of new terms that can be regarded
as Sinophobic like “chinesevirus,” which can possibly lead to
hate attacks in the real-world, and almost certainly harm international relations.

“virus” (see Figure 12(a)) we observe a substantial increase in
cosine similarity between these two terms over time, especially
after the week ending on January 19, 2020. The cosine similarity on both Twitter and /pol/ was below 0.5 in the early models,
while after January 19, 2020, it is mostly over 0.5, with the last
model having a similarity over 0.6. This indicates that the terms
“chinese” and “virus” are used in more similar ways over time
on both Twitter and /pol/.

Semantic Changes between Words

As the last part of our analysis, we set out to assess how the semantic distance between words change over the course of our
datasets. To do this, we leverage the weekly trained word2vec
models (Wt=i , i ∈ T ): for each word2vec model, we extract
the cosine similarity between two terms and then we plot their
similarities over time. This allow us to understand whether two
terms are mapped closer to the multi-dimensional vector space
over time, hence visualizing if two terms are used more in similar context over time. We show some examples in Figure 12:
the terms are selected based on our previous analysis.
We observe several interesting changes in the similarities between terms over time. Specifically, for the terms “chinese” and

Another example are the terms “chinese” and “chink” (see
Figure 12(b)). We observe that for both Twitter and /pol/ the
similarity between these terms increases over the course of our
datasets. Interestingly, the increase in cosine similarity between
these terms is larger for Twitter, likely indicating that Twitter
users are more affected by the COVID-19 with regards to sharing Sinophobic content, while on /pol/ the difference is smaller
which indicates that /pol/ users were affected less by COVID19 when it comes to sharing Sinophobic content.
Finally, we illustrate also the cosine similarity differences
between the terms “chinese” and “bat”/“pangolin” in Fig13

ure 12(c) and 12(d), respectively. For “bat,” we observe that the
cosine similarity was low during our first models and it substantially increased after the week ending on January 26, 2020.
This indicates that both Twitter and /pol/ users have started discussing the fact that the virus allegedly originates from “bats”
around that specific time frame and they continued doing so
until the end of our datasets. For “pangolin,” we observe some
differences across the two Web communities: on /pol/ the users
were not discussing pangolins at all before January 26, 2020
and after that they started discussing them with a high cosine
similarity to the term “chinese” (over 0.4). On the other hand,
on Twitter we observe that users were discussing pangolins
even before the COVID-19 outbreak.

to prevent or mitigate real-world violence stemming from these
behaviors.
While the COVID-19 crisis does provide a unique opportunity to understand the evolution of hateful language, our study
should be also be taken as a call for action. The Web has enabled much of society to keep going, or at least to maintain social connections with other humans, but it has also allowed, and
potentially encouraged the proliferation of hateful language at
a time where we can afford it the least.

Conclusion

To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have
implemented unprecedented measures like social distancing
and even government enforced, large-scale quarantines. This
has resulted in the Web becoming an even more essential
source of information, communication, and socialization. Unfortunately, the Web is also exploited for disseminating disturbing and harmful information, including conspiracy theories and
hate speech targeting Chinese people.
Part of this can be attributed to scapegoating, a basic psychosocial mechanism to deal with stress. Building upon the well
known in-group favoritism/out-group hostility phenomenon,
racist ideology has a long history of scapegoating. A common
scapegoating theme has been to equate the targeted people with
a disease, either figuratively or literally. When threatened by
events outside our control, it is only “natural” to seek for external blame. In the case of COVID-19, the entire world is threatened, and there is a “natural” external actor to blame.
In this paper, we make a first attempt to understand Sinophobic language on the social Web related to COVID-19. To
this end, we collect two large-scale datasets from 4chan’s /pol/
and Twitter over a period of five months. Our results show that
COVID-19 has indeed come with a rise of Sinophobic content
mainly on fringe Web communities like /pol/ and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like Twitter. Relying on word embeddings, we also observe the semantic evolution of Sinophobic
slurs. Moreover, our study also shows that many new Sinophobic slurs are created as the crisis progresses.
Our study has several implications for both society and the
research community focusing on understanding and mitigating
emerging social phenomena on the Web. First, we showed that
the dissemination of hateful content, and in particular Sinophobic content, is a cross-platform phenomenon that incubates
both on fringe Web communities as well as mainstream ones.
This prompts the need to have a multi-platform point-of-view
when studying such emerging social phenomena on the Web.
Second, we showed that Sinophobic behavior evolves substantially, especially after life changing events like the COVID-19
pandemic. This highlights the need to develop new techniques
and tools to understand these changes in behavior and work towards designing and deploying counter-measures with the goal
