Introduction

Online social media has democratized contents. By creating a direct path from
content producer to consumers, the power of production and sharing of information has been redistributed from limited parties to general populations. However,
social media platforms have also given rise to the proliferation of misinformation
and enabled the fast dissemination of unverified rumors [24] [14] [8]. In 2020,
the COVID-19 pandemic put the world in crisis on both physical and psychological health. Simultaneously, a myriad of unverified information flowed on social
media and online outlets. The situation was so severe that the World Health Organization identified it an infodemic on February 2020 [26]. According to studies,
rumors and claims regarding erroneous health practices can have long-lasting effects on physical and psychological health, and it even interfered with the control
of COVID-19 in various parts of the world [2] [23].

INTRODUCTION

2

In light of the infodemic, several investigations have been carried out to look
at the COVID-19 misinformation issue in various aspects. Topics included but
not limited to, the types and contents of COVID-19 misinformation [27] [5], the
spread and prevalence of rumors on social media platforms [7], [13], [10], [27],
[19], [20], the consequences of misinformation [6], and the application of machine learning algorithms on rumor analyses [21] [11]. However, the majority of
the studies focused on data collected from public social media platforms such
as Twitter, Facebook, or Weibo. Explorations on closed messaging platforms,
such as WhatsApp, WeChat, or LINE, remained extremely scarce. While popular
social media platforms are indeed important targets to study online behaviours
and expressions, closed platforms remain an integral place to look at, given its
more private settings.
Our contribution to the current research is in three ways. First, by investigating COVID-19 messages on LINE, we added to the limited research of COVID-19
rumors on closed messaging platforms [17] [18]. According to the survey by Taiwan Communication Survey in 2018, 98.5% of people in Taiwan used LINE as
their primary messaging tool, making LINE the most popular instant message
platform in Taiwan.1 We looked into a dataset of 114, 124 suspicious messages
reported by LINE users in Taiwan between January, 2020 to July, 2020
Secondly, we proposed an efficient algorithm that could cluster a large number of text messages according their topics and narratives without having to
decide how many groups beforehand. The results were clusters where each one
only contains messages that are within limited alterations among each other.
Thus, each cluster is one specific rumor.
Third, by using the results from the algorithm, we were able to look at the
dynamics of each particular rumor over time. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to study not only how the content of a specific COVID-19 rumor
evolved over time but the interaction between content change and popularity. We
found that some form of content alterations were successful in aiding the spread
of false information.
The major findings of this work are three-fold:
1. By combining Hierarchical Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors, we could

reduce computational time of clustering to linear time. This would enable
the large-scale study of rumor transformation.
2. Fact-check did not effectively alleviate the spread of COVID-19-related false
information. In fact, the popularity of rumors were more influenced by
major societal events.
3. Key authoritative figures were often falsely mentioned or quoted in misinformation, and such practice helped with the popularity of a message.
This paper is organized as followed: we introduced our data in Section 3.
Next, we presented the proposed algorithm to cluster text data in Section 4 and
subsequently compared the proposed algorithm with other clustering techniques
in Section 5.2. Finally we reviewed 3 high-volume COVID-19 false information
in Section 5.3. We discussed and concluded this work in Section 6 and 7.
In the following sections, we used clusters and groups interchangeably. And
we described a group of suspicious messages as one rumor, since belonging to
the same group meaning they were seen as one narrative. And then we referred
to rumors that are verified false as misinformation or false information.

From the inception of the pandemic, several survey studies revealed that people
relied on social media to gather COVID-19 information and guidelines [15] [16].
Misinformation on social media has since been a keen interest of the research
community.
Efforts have been put into studies of true and false rumors on social media
[19]. For example, Cinelli et al. compared feedbacks to the reliable and questionable information across five platforms, including Twitter, YouTube, and Gab.
The study showed that users on the less regulated platform, Gab, responded to
questionable information 4 times more than those on the reliable ones. YouTube
users were more attracted to reliable contents, and Twitter users reacted to both
contents more equally [7]. Gallotti et al. looked at the how much unreliable
information Twitter users were exposed to across countries. While the level of
exposure was country dependant, they revealed that the exposure to unreliable
information decreased globally as the pandemic aggravated [10].

3

DATA

Machine learning and deep learning techniques have been used to study the
topics and sentiments for COVID-19 misinformation [1]. For example, Jelodar
et al. used Latent Dirichlet Allocation to extract topics from 560 thousands of
COVID-19 Twitter posts and then used LSTM neural network to classify sentiments of posts [11]. By applying Structure Topic Model and Walktrap Algorithm,
Jo et al. classified questions and answers from South Korea’s largest online forum and discovered that questions related to COVID-19 symptoms and related
government policies revealed the most fear and anxiety [12]. Furthermore, by
employing a multimodal deep neural network for demographic inference and
VADER model for sentiment analysis, Zhang et al. performed a cross sectional
study on Twitter users. They found that older people exhibited more fear and
depression toward COVID-19 than their younger counterparts, and females were
generally less concerned about the pandemic [28].
Previous investigations on rumors indicated that individuals are more likely
to believe in questionable statements after seeing repeatedly [4] [3], and that rumors became more powerful after being shared multiple times [9]. Most studies
only look at the broad topics of misinformation. For example, some looked at
reliable versus unreliable information [7] [10] [27], and others employed natural
language processing techniques to reduce thousands of social media posts into
10 to 20 groups of topics [1] [11] [12] [7]. Shih et al. instead investigated the
content change and temporal diffusion pattern of 17 popular political rumors
on twitter [22]. They found that false rumors came back repeatedly, usually becoming more extreme and intense in wordings, while true information did not
resurface at all. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been similar study
at COVID-19 rumors.

Data

In Taiwan, LINE users can voluntarily forward suspicious messages to factchecking LINE bots such as Cofacts 2 or MyGoPen 3 . The bots archive the
messages and check against their existing databases. If such message has been
fact-checked, the bots would reply with the fact-checked results.
We obtained a dataset of 210, 221 suspicious messages forwarded by LINE

users to a fact-checking LINE bot between January to July, 2020. The dataset included rumors related to COVID-19 and also some other topics. To do clustering,
we preprocessed each message by the following steps:
1. Removed non-Simplified or non-Traditional Chinese Characters.
2. Tokenized with Jieba 4 .
3. Removed tokens that are Chinese stopwords.
In the following sections, we focused on longer texts. We only looked at
114, 124 messages having at least 20 tokens. The character distributions is presented in Table 1.
Along with the text content of each reported message, we also obtained the
report time of each message and a unique identifier for the LINE user that reported the message. It is to note that the user identifier we received were scrambled, therefore, it was not possible for us to use the identifiers to attribute any
message back to any actual LINE user.

Problem Definition

Given a set of n documents, we would like to group them into m clusters, of
which each cluster are made up of documents very similar in usage of terms,
only within a limited degrees of text alterations. Intuitively, we wanted the same
cluster to have documents that talked about the same thing in the same way. Note
that m is unknown beforehand.
For example, given two documents A and B, they should be in the same
cluster if the overlapping terms of A and B constitute a large part of both A and
B. However, if the overlapping terms make up a large part of A but not B, then
they should be in different clusters, because that means B is made up of A and
also some other terms.
Formally, we defined the terms in a document to be its token set after tokenization. And the distance between two documents A and B to be
d( A, B) = 1 −

|tok( A) ∩ tok( B)|
max (|tok( A)|, |tok( B)|)

where tok(·) is the set of tokens of one document. And | · | is the number of
elements in a set.

Algorithm
1. Select p × | D T | elements from D T , denoted as D Tp , and the rest not selected
as set DqT .
2. Construct distance matrix M for D Tp , where Mi,j = d(( D Tp )i , ( D Tp ) j ) by Formula 1. Note that M is symmetric.
3. Feed M into Hierarchical Clustering with distance threshold of λ. We
would get back a sequence of numbers L p , where ( L p )i is the label of element ( D Tp )i . Elements with the same label are in the same cluster. Since
the number itself does not carry meaning, manipulate them so they are all
non-negative whole numbers.
4. ∀( L p )i ∈ L p , if |{l |l = ( L p )i ∀l ∈ L p }| = 1, then replace the value of ( L p )i to
−1. Denote the updated label set as L0p .
5. Train a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier K using the training set (D Tp , L0p ).
And then use K to predict the labels of DqT . Denote the prediction as Lq .

Note that the value of the label itself does not carry any meaning. However,
elements in D T with the same label belong to the same cluster.

Model Comparisons
Evaluation Metrics

We opted precision, recall and F-score as evaluation metrics. In the sense of information retrieval, precision is the number of correct results returned divided by
all results returned from search. Hence, high precision means the predictions are
very relevant. On the other hand, recall measures the number of correct results
returned divided by the total number of correct results. High recall corresponds
to the completeness of returned results. Note that simply by returning all documents, one could achieve 100% of recall, but that will result in very low precision.
Therefore, precision and recall need to be taken together to determine the quality
of classification. F-score, defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall,
is one such measure that combine precision and recall.
5.2.2

Experiments Settings

We compared speed and performances among 4 models:
1. Hierarchical Clustering only (clustering). The result from this model is
considered to be ground truth.
2. Cluster-Classification Model (hybrid). This is our proposed algorithm.
3. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

5

RESULTS

11

4. KMeans with PCA dimensionality reduction (pca+kmeans).
Throughout the experiments we used distance threshold λ = 0.6.
Both LDA and pca+kmeans clustering required a predefined number of groups,
which doesn’t really fit out purposes. However, for the sake of comparison, we
would use the number of groups outputted by clustering model as input to both
models.
5.2.3

Measuring model performances

Suppose the input is tokenized set of k documents D T and the clustering model
put k documents into n groups, (g1 , g2 , ... gn ). g1 is the group having largest
number of documents and gn the least. Another model M put D T into m groups:
(l1 , l2 , ..., lm ). We calculated precision, recall and F-score of model M by the
following algorithm:
Algorithm 1: Calculating Precision, Recall, F-score
i ← 1, c ← 0, p ← 0, r ← 0, f ← 0;
while c < k/2 do
Find lk where lk has the most overlapping components with gi ;
calculate precision pk , recall rk , and F-score f k of lk by comparing with
gi ;
r ← r + rk ;
p ← p + pk ;
f ← f + fk;
i ← i + 1;
c ← c + | gi | ;
Result: precision ← p/i;
recall ← r/i ;
F-score ← f /i ;
In each experiments, we did 5 iterations. In each iteration, we randomly
selected k messages from our dataset. We would get 1 precision and recall after
each iteration, and we used the results of 5 iterations to calculate confidence
intervals.

Experiments Results

As shown in Figure 3, the hybrid model greatly reduced the time required especially when p was equal or less than 0.6. Furthermore, the performance metrics
remained greater than 99% across levels of p (Figures 4, 5, 6). It showed that
the hybrid model’s assignments of groups were very complete (measured by recall), and that the classification of K-Nearest Neighbors did not introduce too
much errors in each group (measured by precision). From Table 3, we observed
that LDA is much slower that other models. Furthermore, the precision was
very low, meaning that predicted groups could have many false positives. On
the other hand, pca+kmeans were 10 times slower than clustering. While the
precision was comparable to that of hybrid methods, recall was only 73%. This
showed that pca+kmeans would miss out many transformations of a message.

We used hybrid methods with train portion p = 0.4 and distance threshold
λ = 0.6 to cluster the whole set of 114 thousands messages. The messages were
separated into 12, 260 groups. Among those, 8, 529 groups only had 1 message.
Therefore, the rest of 105, 595 messages were separated into 3, 731 groups. The

on Apr 2nd (205 documents), the day the Ministry of Health and Welfare announced that this was a misinformation. We subsequently saw another peak on
Apr 6th (166 documents), the day after a 4-day long weekend.
This case first appeared in the dataset on Feb 2nd , 2020. Over the course of 3
and a half months, there were a total of 2, 119 messages reported. The reporting
went viral at least four times: it peaked on February 22nd (80 documents), March
16th (68 documents), welcomed the highest peak on Apr 2nd (205 documents),
then the last one on Apr 6th with 166 documents. We observed a number of key
characteristic changes in the texts itself over the life of this message.

5

RESULTS

First of all, the time-sensitive information in the message evolved with time.
At its early stage, "Lantern Festival", on Feb 8th in 2020, was spotted in the majority of messages. However, on Feb 18th , we spotted the first message that replaced
"Lantern Festival" with "March". Then, after March 10th , the majority of reported
messages used "Mid-Autumn Festival (June 25th , 2020)".
Secondly, the efforts were put to emphasize the authoritativeness from whom
the message was quoted. The first form of this message started with quotation
from The Main-land Academian Zhong, Nan-Shan, who gained fame during the
SARS pandemic in 2003 5 . Other titles, such as "Expert in Pandemic from Mainland China" or "Expert in Coronavirus", were also observed in some transformations. Then later, on Feb 18th , age was first seen in the message: "Expert
in Coronavirus from Mainland China, 78-year-old Academian Zhong, Nan-Shan, emphasized...". Starting March 10th to March 31st , almost every message included
age. Then starting from April 1st , every reported message has Zhong replaced
by Chen, Shih-chung. As the Director of Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command
Center (CECC), Chen’s popularity has skyrocketed during the pandemic through
his daily press conference. This was also when we observed the highest peaks of
the reported messages.
Due to the prevalence of this message spreading on web and closed platforms,
the Ministry of Health and Welfare as well as CECC sent out a press release
and a facebook post 6 7 on April 2nd , reminding the public that this was a false
information. Nevertheless, this did not stop another viral spread of the same
message at the end of a four-day long holiday in Taiwan, where crowds were
seen in every tourists attraction on the island. For days people were worried
that the long-weekend would lead to another outbreak of the pandemic, which
explained why the message bearing the key topic "do not go out" would become
a big hit.

Case 2: Drink salty water can prevent the spread of COVID-19.

In this case we looked at the messages that promoted drinking salt water to prevent the coronavirus. In fact, we investigated two messages and the combination
of the them (Table 7).
We first observed Message (B) in our dataset on March 16th . Over the course
of its evolution, several medical personnel, such as Director of The Veteran Hospital
or Dr. Wang of Tung Hospital (who, in fact, is an Orthopedist), were misquoted.
This showed the use of authoritative power to spread this piece of false medical information. The highest peak was on March 27th , where 265 documents
were reported. Around the same time, a small number of Message (A) were also
lurking, however, it did not get as much attention as Message (B) before both
messages merged into 1 on March 27th and went viral shortly after on March
30th (Orange line in Figure 8). In fact, Message (B) was fact-checked by Taiwan
FactChecking Center 8 rather early, on March 19th 9 and announced it a misinformation, however, this did not stop the piece from misquoting doctors and
continued spreading. As a matter of fact, several translations of Message (A+B)
were reported in April, including but not limited to English, Indonesian, Filipino
and Tibetan. The lifespan of this "drink salted water" message was rather long,
as the another famous fact-checking platform in Taiwan, MyGoPen 10 , released
an article to disprove this false medical advice again in October 2020 11 , 7 months
after it was first seen in our dataset.

This is a 100% accurate information...
Why did we see a huge decline of confirmed cases in China during the last
few days? They simply forced their citizens to rinse mouths with salted water
3 times a day and then drink water for 5
minutes. The virus would attack throats
before the lungs, and when getting in
touch with salted water, the virus would
die or get destroyed in lungs. This is
the only way to prevent the spread of

This rumors first appeared in the dataset on February 6th and has a total of 2121
reports in our dataset. Over the 1.5 months of its most popular time, it went
viral at least two times: one on February 17th with 394 reports, and on March

19th with 543 reports. It was fact-checked by the Taiwan FactCheck Center on
February 15th , 2020 12 , however, the fact-check did not avoid the message from
getting attention. The content started with authoritative tone that announced "We
are at the most critical period of COVID-19", and then provided a list of "do’s
and dont’s". While some suggestions made medical sense in terms of hygiene,
others didn’t 13 . It was not stated explicitly in the message what the critical
period was referring to, however, when taking together the listed "guidelines"
into account, we could deduce that it hinted at the "critical period to prevent
community spread". Community spread (社區感染）is a phase in a pandemic
where many people who tested positive in an area cannot be determined how
they got infected 14 . It is not hard to imagine that people would be concerned and
worried about this significant phase where the risk of getting infected is greatly
increased. In fact, we observed that such concerns co-occurred with the spread
of this piece of message in February.
On February 15th , 2020, Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC)
reported that a taxi driver, infected by a person traveled back from China, was
tested positive with the virus. He died on the same day and became the first
death case in Taiwan. Over the next 4 days, four of his family members were also
tested positive, forming the first COVID-19 cluster in Taiwan. During that time,
people’s concerns for community spread was looming. In fact, Google trend
for search term "社區感染 (Community Spread)" sharply increased on February
16th (Figure 10). Also, during this period, the number of the reported messages
sharply increased (Figure 9).
Content-wise, like what we observed in the first two cases, authorities, especially medical personnel, were used in several versions of the same message to
"endorse" the content (Table 9). We spotted a major revision of the message on
Feb 12th , 6 days after the first report, where the 18 bullets were pruned to 14,
and strong words were modified to gentler tone. Last but not least, the message added a signature of "Regards from Medical Association" on the last line. This
became the most widespread version afterwards. Out of the 394 documents reported on Feb 17th , 333 documents were of this version. Another key event in
content transformation occurred on March 18th . On March 18th , Chen, Shihchung, the CECC director, went to the Legislative Yuan (similar to Congress in

the US) to answer interpellation about COVID-19. On the same day, messages
started to have "Chen, Shih-Chung explained in the Legislative Yuan on March
18th (3/18陳時中立法院明)" before giving the list of suggestive measures. The next
day, we saw another sharp increase of reported messages, reaching the highest
peak. Of the 543 messages reported on March 19th , 280 has quoted Chen.

Discussion

Similar to the findings of [25], we found that fact-check did not effectively alleviate the spread of false information. The popularity of rumors were more associated with major societal events or content changes. In addition to the above 3
case studies, we went through five other COVID-19 related rumors and manually identified common patterns of textual changes in their propagation. First of
all, we observed that key authoritative figures were often (falsely) mentioned or
quoted. For example, COVID-19 rumors often included medical-related persons,
such as doctors or head of CECC. In addition, it was quite common to observe
messages having a line or two disclaimers that expressed the uncertainty of truthfulness of the forwarded messages. For example, The following is for your reference
only, I do not guarantee the truthfulness of the message. (以下謹提供參考不代表是
否正確) was seen in some messages during propagation. Many messages also
included simplified Chinese characters or terms that are rarely used in Taiwan.
For example, while in Taiwan, people refer to SARS pandemic as "SARS", a large

number of messages use "非典", which is a term more popularly used in China.
We also noticed messages that were a merge of other previously independent
ones, and messages that included translation to other non-Chinese languages.
These characteristics could serve as rules to discover possible false information as early detection mechanism. Although we identified these characteristics
manually this time, it is quite possible to employ techniques such as Natural Language Processing to automatically recognize these textual changes in the future,
making it possible to have a automatic early warning system of misinformation
that does not involve fact-check by professionals.
This study had several limitations. First, this data was collected by people’s
reports. Therefore, it was impossible to infer the true distribution of messages
without making some assumptions. That is, if we saw more health-related misinformation in our data, it did not necessarily translate to more health-related
rumors circulating in the platform. In fact, it could also be that people were
more alerted and skeptical at truthfulness health-related information. In addition, we only looked at text messages, therefore, information distributed visually
or in audio was not covered. Lastly, our algorithm to group messages does not
work well with short texts.

Conclusion

In this paper, we analyzed COVID-19 related rumors on a closed-messaging platform, LINE. We proposed a clustering algorithm that reduced the computational
time from exponential to linear time. The algorithm enabled us to investigate the
evolution of text messages. In fact, the algorithm enabled the research community to perform large-scale studies on the evolution of text messages at messagelevel rather than topic-level. Similar to what [22] discovered in its study of 17
political rumors, we found that false COVID-19 rumors tend to resurface multiple times even after being fact-checked, and with different degrees of content
alterations. Furthermore, the messages often falsely quoted or mentioned authoritative figures, and such practice was helpful for the rumor to reach broader
audiences. Also, the resurfacing patterns seemed to be influenced by major societal events and content change. However, each peak of popularity would not last
long and it was often without good explanation about how one wave of propagation ended. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few works that study
COVID-19 misinformation on closed-messaging platforms and the first to study

textual evolution of COVID-19 related rumors during its propagation. We would
hope that this would further spark more studies in rumor propagation patterns.
