Abstract—The COVID-19 pandemic has affected
people’s lives in many ways. Social media data can reveal
public perceptions and experience with respect to the
pandemic, and also reveal factors that hamper or support
efforts to curb global spread of the disease. In this paper,
we analyzed COVID-19-related comments collected from
six social media platforms using Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques. We identified relevant
opinionated keyphrases and their respective sentiment
polarity (negative or positive) from over 1 million randomly
selected comments, and then categorized them into
broader themes using thematic analysis. Our results
uncover 34 negative themes out of which 17 are economic,
socio-political, educational, and political issues. 20
positive themes were also identified. We discuss the
negative issues and suggest interventions to tackle them
based on the positive themes and research evidence.

I. Introduction

infectious diseases are responsible for many
deaths and disabilities globally [1]. Evidence shows that at
least 43 million people contracted the H1N1 flu worldwide
within 12 months of the pandemic which, in turn, resulted in
over 200,000 deaths [2], [3]. In addition, 770,000 HIV/AIDSrelated deaths were reported in 2018 alone, with over 37
million people infected globally [4]. The latest emerging
infectious disease, COVID-19 [5], [6], has already infected
over 15.7 million people worldwide, with a mortality of at
least 640,000 as of July 25, 2020 [7]. Emerging infectious

diseases have also been shown to inflict significant burden on
economies and public health systems [8]–[10]. For example,
global health systems are struggling to cope with the COVID19 pandemic, while unemployment/job losses, reduced
income/productivity, and business closures are prevalent
among individuals and organizations due to the lockdown
measures imposed by governments. To understand public
perceptions toward the pandemic, social media data can
provide the required insights from a global perspective [11].
Social media has been a major and rich data source for
research in many domains, including health, due to its 3.8
billion active users [12] from diverse geographic locations
across the globe. For instance, researchers analyzed user
comments extracted from social media platforms (such as
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, discussion forums, etc.) to
uncover insights about health-related issues (e.g., mental
health [13], [14], substance use [15], [16], diseases [17]–[20],
etc.), political issues (e.g., elections [21]–[24]), and businessrelated issues (e.g., customer engagement [25], [26]). With
respect to COVID-19, social media comments can reveal
public opinions about governments and health organizations’
response to the pandemic, as well as economic, health, social,
political, physical, and psychological impact of COVID-19 on
global populations in line with the factors affecting efforts to
limit the spread of the disease either negatively or positively.
In this paper, we apply natural language processing (NLP)
to analyze COVID-19-related comments from six social media
platforms (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and three online
discussion forums) to uncover issues surrounding the
pandemic based on public perceptions. NLP is a widely used
method for extracting insights from unstructured texts, such as
social media data and clinical texts (e.g., electronic health
records [27] and patient journals [28]). Our research
contributions are the following:
1) We implement context-based NLP for detecting relevant
and opinionated themes or keyphrases from social media
comments related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
2) We identify negative and positive themes that capture
public opinions about the pandemic. Our results reveal 34
negative themes out of which 17 are economic, sociopolitical, educational, and political issues. 20 positive
themes were also identified.
3) We suggest interventions to tackle the negative issues.

The interventions, which are based on the positive themes
and research evidence, will inform and help governments,
organizations, and individuals to minimize the spread and
impact of COVID-19, and to respond effectively to future
pandemics.
II. RELATED WORK
Over the years, social media has been a rich source of data
for health informatics research [29]. Natural language
processing (NLP) techniques have been widely used for
analyzing social media comments and clinical texts (such as
identifying health-related and psychosocial issues with respect
to the COVID-19 pandemic [30]).
The lexicon-based NLP technique was used to detect the
prevalence of keywords indicating public interests in ecigarette, marijuana, influenza, and Ebola using social media
data; while Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique was
used to retrieve topics from the corpus [31]. LDA has also
been utilized to extract latent topics from COVID-19-related
comments posted on social media [32]. Also, the Natural
Language Toolkit (NLTK) was used by [33] to identify top
collocated n-grams (bigrams and trigrams) from clinical
emails.
Furthermore, a custom topic modeling technique, called
Ailment Topic Aspect Model, was employed to generate latent
topics from Twitter data with the aim of identifying mentions
of ailments of interest, including allergies, obesity, and
insomnia [34]. The non-negative matrix factorization is
another topic modeling technique used in health informatics
research to extract topics from social media data [35]. A thirdparty tool for text mining, called KH-Coder, has also been
used to explore potential topics related to H1N1-related
advice, vaccine, and antiviral uptake in the United Kingdom
based on Twitter data [36]. The machine learning-based NLP
was utilized to analyze unstructured clinical notes to predict
hospital readmissions for COPD patients [37] and perform
sentiment analysis of user comments on mental health apps
[38]. None of the techniques above considered contextual text
analysis which can yield more meaningful and relevant
outcomes.
To demonstrate the significance of contextual text analysis,
Dave et al. conducted experiments to compare non-contextual
N-Gram Chunking technique and the contextual Part-ofSpeech (POS) chunking technique [39]. Rather than just
extracting n-grams, the POS chunking method considers
context of words by using regular grammars or POS patterns
that specify how sentences should be deconstructed into
keyphrases of interest. Their results show that systems using
the POS chunking technique extracted relevant features
(keyphrases) and outperformed systems adopting N-Gram
chunking for feature extraction. We extend this approach with
enhanced part-of-speech (POS) patterns tailored to our goal,
chunking and CoNLL IOB tagging, as well as keyphrase
transformation and sentiment scoring.
III. METHODOLOGY
This paper aims to investigate public opinions regarding the
COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the disease on their
lives. To achieve this objective, we utilize the following well-

established computational techniques:
1) We developed programs or scripts to mine user comments
related to COVID-19 from six social media platforms.
2) We preprocessed the data using NLP techniques.
3) We applied a seven-stage context-aware NLP approach to
identify opinionated and meaningful keyphrases or
themes from the comments.
4) We applied thematic analysis to iteratively categorize
related keyphrases identified in step 3 above into broader
themes or categories.
A. Data Collection
A total of 47,410,795 COVID-19-related comments were
collected across six social media platforms (Twitter, YouTube,
Facebook,
PushSquare.com,
Archinect.com,
and
LiveScience.com), as described below:
1) Twitter: We built a console application to mine
47,249,973 tweets in real-time using the Twitter
Streaming API [40] and C# programming language. The
program targets tweets from the following hashtags:
#COVID19,
#COVID,
#ncov2019,
#Covid_19,
#StopTheSpread, #CoronaVirusUpdates, #StayAtHome,
#selfquarantine,
#COVID-19,
#COVIDー19,
#panicbuying, #caronavirusoutbreak, #CoronaCrisis,
#SocialDistancing, #cronovirus, #CoronaVirusUpdate,
#MyPandemicSurvivalPlan, #Quarantined, #pandemic,
#CoronavirusPandemic,
#Coronavid19,
#coronapocalypse, #QuarantineLife, #CoronaVirus,
#QuarantineAndChill, and #CoronavirusOutbreak.
2) YouTube: We wrote a Python script to automatically
extract 111,722 user comments linked to 2,939 COVID19-related videos using the YouTube Data API [41]. The
keywords used for the video search include covid-19,
covid19, and coronavirus.
3) Facebook: We adopted a semi-automatic technique to
extract comments due to search restrictions imposed by
Facebook. We first obtained 91 groups and 68 pages
related to COVID-19 manually using the following
keywords: COVID, COVID-19, and Coronavirus.
Afterwards, we developed a Python script to retrieve
8,382 and 777 comments from the pages and groups
respectively.
4) Discussion forums: We collected 18401, 20747, and 793
user comments from COVID-19-related threads on
PushSquare.com [42], Archinect.com [43], [44], and
LiveScience.com [45] respectively using Python scripts.
B. Data Preprocessing
To clean the data and prepare it for keyphrase extraction,
we apply the following preprocessing steps using NLP
techniques implemented using Python:
1) Remove mentions, URLs, and hashtags
2) Expand contractions (such as replacing “couldn’t” with
“could not”)

3) Replace HTML characters with Unicode equivalent (such

4) Remove HTML tags (such as “<div>”, “<p>”, etc.)
5) Remove special characters that are not required for
sentence boundary detection
6) Compress words with repeated characters (such as
compressing “poooool” to “pool”)
7) Convert slangs to English words using relevant online
slang dictionaries [46], [47]
8) Remove words that are numbers
After applying the above steps on the data, and removing
non-English comments (identified using the langdetect Python
library [48]) and duplicate comments, the total number of
comments reduced to 8,021,341. We randomly selected about
13% of these comments (n=1,051,616) to form the corpus
used in this paper.
C. Keyphrase Extraction
To extract meaningful and opinionated keyphrases/themes
which are words or phrases representing topical content of
each document (or comment) in our corpus, we utilized a
context-aware NLP approach. This approach extends the
version adopted by [39] with enhanced part-of-speech (POS)
patterns tailored to our objective, chunking (in conjunction
with CoNLL IOB tagging [49]), as well as transformation and
sentiment scoring stages. In subsequent subsections, we
describe the components of our architecture, as shown in Fig.
1. In Fig. 2, we present an algorithm (based on the
architecture) which accepts a regular grammar and our corpus
as parameters and returns keyphrases of interest as output. The

algorithm was implemented using Python.
1) Grammar definition

We defined a regular grammar (see below) which is a set of
rules composed of POS patterns that describe how the
syntactic units of each document in our corpus are
deconstructed into their constituents or parts. The grammar
captures the context of each comment and the
opinions/sentiments expressed using nouns, adjectives, and
verbs. Research revealed that nouns are crucial for detecting
the context of a conversation [50], while both adjectives and
verbs are significant for sentiment classification [51].
Grammar: { <DT>? <JJ.*>* <NN.*>* <VB.*>? (<IN>?
<DT>? <JJ.*>* <NN.*>*)? }
The regular grammar above is composed of patterns of POS
tags from the well-established Penn Treebank Tagset [52],
[53]. For instance, the <NN.*> pattern matches any type of
noun (see Table I), <JJ.*> matches any type of adjective,
<VB.*> matches any type of verb, <IN> matches a
preposition or subordinating conjunction, and <DT> matches a
determiner. We considered determiners and prepositions since
they usually occur together with nouns and adjectives in
sentences (e.g., public concern about the virus). Also, the “*”
symbol after a POS pattern refers to “zero or more
occurrences”, while “?” refers to “zero or one occurrence”.
2) Sentence breaking and Tokenization

Next, each document is separated into unique sentences. To
achieve this, we utilized a robust unsupervised algorithm
(within the Python NLTK’s tokenize library [54]) which
considers collocations, punctuations, capitalizations, and
abbreviations in determining sentence boundaries within each
document. Afterwards, each sentence is further broken down
into words or tokens in preparation for POS tagging.

Fig. 3. A sample parse tree illustrating the output of the chunker.

3) POS Tagging

Each token is assigned a POS tag (within the Penn
Treebank Tagset) denoting its part of speech in the English
language. For example, tokens in the following sentence “Stop
panic buying and be sure to use face masks in public areas”
are tagged as follows: [('Stop', 'NNP'), ('panic', 'NN'),
('buying', 'NN'), ('and', 'CC'), ('be', 'VB'), ('sure', 'JJ'), ('to',
'TO'), ('use', 'VB'), ('face', 'NN'), ('masks', 'NNS'), ('in', 'IN'),
('public', 'JJ'), ('areas', 'NNS')].
4) Lemmatization

Next, each tagged token is lemmatized or converted into its
root word based on its part of speech. Prior to lemmatization,
we converted the tokens or words to lowercase.
Lemmatization is achieved by using the English vocabulary
and conducting morphological analysis of words [55]. Hence,
a root word is the dictionary form of the original word. By
converting the tokens to their root form, we harmonized
similar words while preserving their meaning. For instance,
the following verb words “seen” and “sees” are converted to
their root form – “see”. Referring to our previous sample
tagged tokens, the output of the lemmatization stage is:
[('stop', 'NNP'), ('panic', 'NN'), ('buying', 'NN'), ('and', 'CC'),
('be', 'VB'), ('sure', 'JJ'), ('to', 'TO'), ('use', 'VB'), ('face', 'NN'),
('mask', 'NNS'), ('in', 'IN'), ('public', 'JJ'), ('area', 'NNS')].
5) Chunking

Next, we created a chunker that uses the regular grammar
defined above to match phrases comprising an optional
determiner, followed by zero or more of any type of adjective,
zero or more of any type of noun, zero or one of any type of
verb, and an optional component. This component consists of
an optional preposition, followed by an optional determiner,
zero or more of any type of adjective, and zero or more of any
type of noun. Using our previous example, the chunker
produces the parse tree in Fig. 3, showing the key terms (KT)
that match the grammar specified.
To generate the candidate keyphrases, we first converted the
parse tree (or chunks) generated by the chunker for each
document into a CoNLL IOB format. An IOB (Inside-OutsideBeginning) tag specifies how a key term functions in the
context of a phrase – whether the term begins (B-KT), is
inside (I-KT), or outside (O-KT or O) the phrase [49]. Next,
we iteratively group terms that are part of a keyphrase (i.e., BKT and I-KT) and stops when a term that does not belong to
the keyphrase (i.e., O-KT or O) is encountered.
For example, the CoNLL IOB format of the parse tree in
Fig. 3 gives [('stop', 'NNP', 'B-KT'), ('panic', 'NN', 'I-KT'),

'NN', 'I-KT'), ('mask', 'NNS', 'I-KT'), ('in', 'IN', 'B-KT'),
('public', 'JJ', 'I-KT'), ('area', 'NNS', 'I-KT')]. By iteratively
grouping the B-KT and I-KT terms, the following keyphrases
emerged: “stop panic buying”, “be sure”, and “use face mask
in public area”.
6) Transformation and Filtering

In this stage, we removed keyphrases that are stopwords
(i.e., common words, such as about, the, from, there, had, can,
etc.) from our list of candidate keyphrases. We also removed
selected stopwords from the start, end, and within keyphrases
while preserving their meaning. For example, “be sure” will
be filtered out since “be” and “sure” are included in our predefined list of stopwords that cannot start nor end a keyphrase.
Third, we removed keyphrases whose length exceed ten.
While previous research retained only keyphrases up to length
six [39], we extended our threshold to ten to avoid losing
important keyphrases that would enrich insights from this
research.
7) Sentiment scoring and Filtering

In line with our objective to keep only opinionated
candidate keyphrases (i.e., keyphrases with “negative” or
“positive” sentiment polarity [56]), we assigned a sentiment
score Ss ranging from –1 to +1 to each keyphrase using the
popular VADER lexicon-based algorithm [57]. Afterwards,
we filtered out non-opinionated or “neutral” keyphrases using
the criteria summarized in Table II. For example, the Ss for
“stop panic buying” and “use face mask in public area” are –
0.6705 and 0.1027 respectively; hence, will be retained since
they are opinionated. The neutral score ranges from –0.05 and
+0.05 based on the outcome of the experiments conducted by
[57].
D. Categorizing Keyphrases
Next, the final keyphrases or themes were manually
categorized into broader themes (an approach also used by
[33] to categorize phrases) by four reviewers. The reviewers
were divided into two teams – T1 and T2. T1 consists of two
reviewers who were tasked with grouping the negative
keyphrases, while T2 comprises the two other reviewers who
grouped the positive keyphrases. Each reviewer iteratively
examines the keyphrases and continues to group them until no
new category emerges (i.e., saturation level is reached). The
percentage of agreement between reviewers in T1 is 98%,
while that of T2 is 99.3%.
IV. RESULTS
A. Negative Keyphrases
A total of 427,875 unique negative keyphrases were
generated from our large corpus. Fig. 4 shows some of the
keyphrases in our results and their dominance (the gray
bubbles of varying sizes illustrate dominance based on
frequency of occurrence). In decreasing order, death is the
most dominant keyphrase (n=10,187), followed by die
(n=7,240), fight (n=5,891), bad (n=3,808), kill (n=3,668), lose

B. Positive Keyphrases
On the other hand, 520,685 unique positive keyphrases
emerged from our corpus. Some of the keyphrases and their
dominance based on frequency are illustrated in Fig. 5. The
most dominant keyphrase, in decreasing order, is help
(n=18,498), followed by hope (n=7,708), protect (n=7,130),
love (n=6,895), support (n=6,198), good (n=5,740), share
(n=5,187), care (n=4,917), and stay safe (n=4,917). Other
keyphrases in our results include stay healthy, gratitude, relief
fund, help slow spread, solidarity, ask for friend, encourage
people, stay calm, great initiative, fresh air, use hand
sanitizer, artificial intelligence, support business, keep safe
distance, practice good hygiene, pray at home, play video
game, use defense production act, protect public health,
encourage social distancing, free webinar, etc.

hard (n=2,720), worry (n=2,476), sick (n=2,314), sad
(n=2,129), etc. Some non-unigram keyphrases in our results
include self isolation, difficult time, life at risk, death toll rise,
conspiracy theory, become infected, spread misinformation,
panic buy, lack of leadership, no social distancing, travel
restriction, spread fake news, in time of uncertainty, public
health emergency, biological weapon, desperate time call for
desperate measure, contagious disease, hospital overwhelm,
take advantage of crisis, suffer from underlie medical
condition, etc.

C. Keyphrase Categories
After grouping related keyphrases into broader themes or
categories (as discussed in the Methodology section), 34
negative and 20 positive categories emerged. We refer to these
categories as “themes”, and the keyphrases under each
category as “subthemes” in the remaining parts of this paper.
The 34 negative themes are further distributed into healthrelated issues, economic issues, psychosocial issues, sociopolitical issues, social issues, educational issues, and political
issues. In this paper, we focused on 17 negative themes
mapped to economic, socio-political, educational, and political
issues (see Table III). As shown in Fig. 6, the top 5 negative
themes based on number of user comments is Concerns about
social distancing and isolation policies (n=8,872), followed
by Misinformation (n=2,223), Political influence (n=1,640),
Financial issues (n=1,622), and Poor governance (n=1,559).
Fig. 6 also shows the number of subthemes under each theme.
Furthermore, Fig. 7 shows the 20 positive themes and the
corresponding number of subthemes and comments. Based on
number of comments, Public awareness (n=22,749) emerged
as the top theme, followed by Spiritual support (n=12,130),
and Encouragement (n=5,244). Other themes include Charity
(n=942), Entertainment (n=798), Gratitude (n=758),
Development of curative solutions or treatments (n=653),
Advocacy for increased testing (n=341), Physical activity
(n=285), Cleaner environment (n=278), etc.

V. DISCUSSION
Our results revealed various negative and positive themes
representing public opinions about the pandemic, as well as
impact of COVID-19 on people and institutions in line with
the factors affecting efforts to limit the spread of the disease
either negatively or positively. In this section, we discuss the
negative issues (see Table III) and suggest interventions based
on the positive themes (see Fig. 7) and research evidence.
A. Negative issues regarding COVID-19 pandemic
1) Economic issues

Based on our findings, the COVID-19 pandemic led to
unemployment, low revenue or losses for business, low supply
of essential items, challenging living condition, economic
downturn, and financial crisis.
a)

Fig. 6. The top chart shows negative themes and the corresponding
number of subthemes, while the bottom chart shows the total number
of user comments for each theme.

Job- and Business-related crisis

In line with our findings (see sample comments below),
research shows that the pandemic triggered massive global
unemployment crisis [58]–[60] where people are losing jobs
or unable to get one. This is due to lockdowns and reduced
consumer spending which led to businesses/companies
experiencing low income/revenue and losses as many near
bankruptcy, shutdown temporarily, or likely to go out of
business [61]–[64].
“...job layoffs are soaring faster than any time in recorded
history...This looks bad and it is bad. The worst jobless claims in
U.S. history means the economy has fallen into the abyss.” [C9100]
“My job is shutdown; my husband job is shutdown...How am I
supposed to pull this off? There is NO income. We have 4 children
including an 8-week-old baby. I need help NOW.” [C7119]

b)

Economic downturn

Based on our findings, the pandemic pushes global
economies toward recession as stock market indices crashes,
as shown in the sample comment below. Evidence shows that
the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted stock markets
more forcefully than any other disease outbreak in history
[65]. For example, primary sectors (e.g., agriculture and
petroleum and oil), secondary sectors (e.g., manufacturing),
and other sectors (e.g., finance, food, real estate, tourism, and
transportation sectors) driving stock market indices
experienced various challenges (such as supply chain
disruption, revenue crash, transaction halt, etc.) compounded
by lockdown and social isolation policies aimed to curb
COVID-19 spread [66].
“Our 250 economists have updated our global forecasts.
Coronavirus will inflict a short, sharp global recession. We expect
2020 world growth to drop to zero. In Q1, we see the global
economy shrinking faster than in the financial crisis” [C10002]

c)

Fig. 7. The top chart shows positive themes and the corresponding
number of subthemes, while the bottom chart shows the total number
of user comments for each theme.

Shortage of essential items

People lamented shortage of food items, toiletries including
hand sanitizers, and personal protective equipment (e.g., face
masks, protective gear and garment, etc.) necessary to prevent
contracting the disease. In addition, public health centres and
hospitals experience shortage of testing kits and ventilators
which hampered efforts to identify COVID-19 cases and keep

patients alive. Also, blood shortages were reported in blood
banks and lockdown measures may prevent many people from
donating blood. Our findings (see sample comments below)
align with research which confirms critical supply shortages of
the items highlighted above [67]–[71].
“U.S. cities have acute shortages of masks, test kits, ventilators as
they face coronavirus threat” [C11119]
“Acute shortage of blood in the blood banks...Blood donations
needed during & after coronavirus pandemic” [C7999]
“Is anybody else having a food shortage in their grocery stores?
My hometown stores are about completely empty.” [C4442]

d)

Challenging living condition and Financial Issues

As shown in the comments below, people experienced
difficulty providing for their families or meeting their needs
such as paying bills (e.g., rent, mortgage installment, credit
card payment, phone bill, etc.) and buying sufficient food, as a
result of job losses and the strict lockdowns which impose
financial hardship on people, including owners of small
businesses (such as restaurants and cosmetics shops) and
hustlers. Many organizations are unable to pay employees’ full
salary due to financial constraints caused by the pandemic and
resort to half salaries or job cuts (see [C621]). Research has
shown that households experienced food insecurity as a result
of poor financial status caused by the COVID-19 pandemic
[72].
“Please help us. Lost my job due to coronavirus shutting down my
workplace. I have no income...no rent.” [C9991]
“...there are a heartbreaking number of hungry Americans posting
their Venmo's and asking for help in this thread...” [C12883]
“Today my company instituted across-the-board pay cuts of 1030%, and canceled merit increases, bonuses, and 401(k)
matches...” [C621]

e)

Flight cancellations

Based on our findings, people lamented sudden cancellation
of flights and difficulty in getting refunds from affected
Airlines, as shown in the sample comment below. These
cancellations are due to border closures and travel bans
imposed by governments of many countries to curtail the
importation of COVID-19; however, such actions inflicted
much pain and distress to stranded passengers, as well as
financial losses to the Airlines [73].
“Very disappointed how Etihad is handling COVID19. Not only did
they cancel all flights, but it is legally impossible for me to travel
given the travel bans. Instead of refunding my money, I am getting
credit that has restrictions to re-book by Sept. How is this fair?”
[C144]

2) Socio-political issues
a)

Concerns about social distancing and isolation
policies

Our findings revealed public concerns over lockdown,
social distancing, and isolation policies irrespective of their
perceived benefits. Some of the concerns include: (i) people
disrespectfully snubbing those who are not 6-feet away from

them; (ii) social distancing/lockdown without financial
support; (iii) implementing isolation/quarantine policies that
contradict the World Health Organization’s advice; (iv) human
rights violation; (v) weak enforcement of lockdown policy;
(vi) reliance on self-isolation without aggressive testing; (vii)
ineffectiveness of isolation/lockdown in slums; (viii)
devastating effect of social isolation on domestic violence
victims; (ix) millions stranded due to lockdown and struggling
to get food and water; (x) spike in anxiety and depression
cases after lockdown announcement. Sample comments are
shown below:
“...but of societal norms; so much so that there are now actual
social distancing snobs who look down on you if you're less than 6
feet away. Will coronavirus kill all our humanity too?” [C7116]
“This is exactly what I am afraid of since lockdown...exploiting the
crisis to strip us of our rights.” [C909]

b)

Controversy over precautionary measures

Precautionary measures, such as wearing face masks and
gloves, generated controversies based on our findings. For
example, some people think N95 masks with a valve can aid
the spread of the virus from infected patients (see sample
comment below), while some are concerned about the stigma
attached to wearing masks.
“They tell the infected to wear a N95 mask which is 95 effective with
no oils...half the masks have a one way valve for the exhale which
is unfiltered. They are trying to kill everyone.” [C193]

c)

Lack of preparedness and Protests

Furthermore, people highlighted lack of preparedness on the
part of governments and health systems as a factor aiding the
spread of the disease. Evidence shows that many countries and
health authorities failed to rapidly perceive the threat posed by
COVID-19 [74], [75], thereby allowing it to degenerate into a
pandemic level that imposes hardship on world population.
Therefore, it is unsurprising that there are protests in several
countries, such as health workers and some essential workers
protesting about shortage of protective equipment, citizens of
developing countries protesting about lack of food and
electricity during the lockdown, essential workers requesting
for hazard pay during the pandemic, citizens protesting against
their government’s inactions toward protecting them from
COVID-19, and so on. Below are sample comments:
“Another nurses protest calling attention to the shortage of
protective equipment, and rationing policies by hospitals.” [C299]
“This is what is happening in Chile. People protesting because
President…is not taking the correct responsibility on Covid_19. We
need national quarantine!!” [C10384]
“We are hungry, no food no light - you cannot tell us to stay
indoors. Nigerians in parts of Lagos already threatening to defy
government lockdown directives with a protest in two days”
[C8886]

d)

Risk of spread at detention centres

Moreover, people raised concerns about risk of spreading
COVID-19 disease in prisons and the need for decongestion,
as shown in the sample comment below. Evidence already
shows that incarcerated populations are vulnerable to

infectious diseases, including COVID-19, due to unavoidable
close contact (since prisons or detention centres are often
overcrowded and poorly ventilated/sanitized) and poor
healthcare access [76], [77].
“As cases increase in Texas, so do concerns about the well-being of
people in Texas prisons and jails.” [C1555]

3) Educational issues
a)

Disruption in Education

Our findings revealed the disruptive effect of the COVID19 pandemic on education globally, such as school closures.
People are concerned about their children or wards’ education
including the cost implication of virtual learning put in place
by schools, as well as children in rural areas who would be
deprived of learning. This aligns with evidence highlighting
the effect of school closures on 80% of children worldwide,
and the worsened inequalities in educational outcomes
between children in lower- and higher-income countries [78].
“There is still NO date for schools to reopen in the Capital.”
[C4440]
“You are putting the most disadvantaged students at a further
educational disadvantage...” [C91]
“What kind of education are we getting? We haven't paid such high
fees for ZOOM kind of education. Our online education system is
so sick and badly affecting our grades and that's totally unfair!!
90k for this kind of education is way too worthy!” [C181]

b)

Knowledge gap

Furthermore, knowledge gap (in form of ignorance and lack
of intelligence) on the part of leadership and society is another
factor hampering the containment of COVID-19, based on our
findings. As shown in the comments below, authorities are
short of knowledge as regards what should be done, while
people are ill-informed due to limited access to accurate and
coherent information about the disease and preventive/control
measures.
“Nursing, a primarily female profession, is under attack. The CDC
in ignorance says wear a bandana. THIS IS NOT PROTECTION!
Lives at stake! Hospitals have their heads in the sand. Please! Can
you hear us?” [C818]
“Some neighbors even want us out because they think they would
breathe this virus in the air and we're inside our own hostel! This
is dangerous ignorance!” [C6000]

c)

Misinformation

The proliferation of misinformation is impeding access to
accurate information about COVID-19 that could have helped
curb the spread of the disease and save lives. Misinformation
which refers to false information or information with limited
or without scientific evidence is one of the top 5 issues that
emerged in our findings, and also reported by previous
research [79]–[84]. Sample comment below reveals public
concerns about misinformation regarding COVID-19:
“The amount of fake news on all the health concerns regarding
COVID19 is shocking. Only person I trust with info is my cousin
who is a doctor. She has just told me it DOESN'T last in the air, as

long as you are two metres away and sneeze into a tissue you are
fine!!” [C12010]

4) Political issues

Elected governments or political appointees are central to
decision making or governance that should improve the
standard of living of people and assure their health and safety.
However, people are concerned about widespread interference
in COVID-19-related matters for political gain, based on our
findings. In addition, they are concerned about the absence of
strong leadership in the wake of the pandemic, and the poor
state (or lack) of key public infrastructure (e.g., electricity,
water, internet, healthcare facilities/centres, etc.). Research has
shown that political beliefs and partisanship pose a significant
limitation on the effectiveness of preventive measures (such as
social distancing) [85]–[87]. Sample comments below reveal
public opinion regarding these issues:
“Quite possibly the worst governor in the country. He's hurting not
only his own citizens but all Americans, as all the people on spring
break and theme parks go home with covid19.” [C5777]
“When authorities and armed forces asked you to self-quarantine
with no internet and no electricity (16 hours load shedding) in
Hunza ...?!” [C108]

B. Interventions for addressing the negative issues
To cushion the effect of economic issues on people,
“charity” and “grassroots support” are important factors as
revealed in our findings. Mobile technology can play a
significant role in ensuring effective distribution of relief
items. For example, GPS-enabled and multilingual mobile
apps can help people to easily find food banks nearest to them.
Moreover, government-funded or non-governmental charity
organizations responsible for distributing economic relief to
people can easily expand their reach or coverage and make
delivery decisions based on data collected through these apps.
For instance, people can indicate their needs through these
apps and other information, such as location, age group, health
condition, and whether they are in self-isolation (due to
exposure to COVID-19). These apps can also be used to
onboard volunteers who want to offer financial and material
assistance and connect them to those in need. Furthermore, the
data collected through these apps can further be analyzed
using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques (such as machine
learning or deep learning) to predict the communities that are
in dire need of assistance. Besides technology usage,
governments can budget for additional measures to protect the
finances of people and businesses such as keeping people
employed through financial partnership with employers,
providing stimulus packages, and facilitating quick
employment for the jobless [88]. Evidence shows that
governments of some countries are adopting these measures to
varying degrees [89].
Regarding shortage of items to protect people from the
pandemic (such as face mask and hand sanitizers), a
“homemade protective equipment” approach can be employed
as a viable alternative, as revealed in our findings. Evidence
shows that homemade masks, for example, can offer
protection from COVID-19 transmission, in the event where
medical masks are not available [90]. To address supply chain

issues with respect to high demand and essential products,
research suggests recovery strategies (such as increase in
production shifts, use of spare capacity, emergency sourcing,
bolstering capacity locally, and collaboration with supply
chain partners) [91], [92].
Regarding concerns about social distancing and isolation
policies imposed by governments, as well as controversies
over precautionary measures suggested by health
professionals, “public awareness” is a major and useful tool
to address these issues, including misinformation, as revealed
in our findings. Providing timely and accurate COVID-19related information to people, and also connecting them to
evidence-based resources and health professionals to resolve
their questions or confusions, can be lifesaving. To reach a
wider audience on a personalized basis, mobile- and voiceenabled chatbots equipped with real-time access to evidencebased and validated resources (such as approved safety
measures by World Health Organization, as well as
government-approved policies or guidelines) can be developed
such that people can interact (in their own language) with the
chatbots using their smartphones anytime. Difficult questions
can be automatically channeled to health experts for responses
within the same chat window. For those with traditional
cellular phones, governments and local health agencies can
partner with telecom firms to deliver COVID-19-related
information directly to people’s phones as a short messaging
service (SMS) at regular intervals. In addition, official
COVID-19-related channels on social media (such as [93])
supervised by health experts and local/international health
organizations can provide accurate and frequent updates.
Regarding educational disruptions due to COVID-19,
evidence shows that digital technologies are pedagogical tools
that can enhance diverse forms of learning both within and
outside the school environment [94]. Based on our findings,
“online learning” (also called e-learning, virtual learning,
virtual classroom, digital classroom, or distance learning) will
help mitigate the impact of educational disruptions caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic. While it may not be as effective as
in-class learning in some cases, it will prevent potential brain
drain that may result in the absence of continuous learning.
Mobile and web-based learning platforms, many of which are
available today, should be readily accessible in schools at all
levels going forward. Designers should ensure these tools
provide personalized learning experience such that students
can manage their own content and the tools offer tailored
suggestions that fit their interests or needs. The tools should
also support collaborative learning where students can work
together on assignments, projects, or other tasks similar to
what they do in the real-world. Furthermore, governments
across the globe should ensure equitable access to these
educational technologies irrespective of economic, financial,
racial, or cultural differences. Public infrastructure supporting
these technologies (such as stable electricity, as well as
affordable and reliable internet) should be considered a top
priority and made readily accessible to people.
Finally, governments at all levels should partner (rather than
compete) with health professionals and researchers to form a
strong force against COVID-19. Our findings revealed
“advocacy for testing” which reflects public call for increased
testing since some governments are still struggling in this area

due to their political interests superseding public health.
Research argues the significance and effectiveness of adaptive
evidence-making intervention (a fusion of scientific evidence
and policy) during public health emergencies (such as the
COVID-19 pandemic) [95]. This can only be possible if
political leaders and health experts align and work
harmoniously to address current and future pandemics.
VI. CONCLUSION
We explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
people globally using social media data. We analyzed over 1
million comments obtained from six social media platforms
using a seven-stage context-aware Natural Language
Processing (NLP) approach to extract relevant keyphrases
which were further categorized into broader themes. Our
results revealed 34 negative themes and 20 positive themes
surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. We discussed the
economic, socio-political, educational, and political issues and
suggested interventions to tackle them based on the positive
themes and research evidence. These interventions would
inform and help governments, organizations, and individuals
to minimize the spread and impact of COVID-19 and to
respond effectively to future pandemics.
