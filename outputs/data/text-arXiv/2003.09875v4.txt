Introduction

A main concern related to the study of the recent viral pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID19) is, of course, to predict its evolution. Concerning its spread in Italy, at the web-page [2] a
basic SIR model has been initially used for this purpose. Even though this simple model has
displayed interesting potentialities in yielding accurate predictions of the diffusion of the disease
for the subsequent few days from the last available monitoring report, it heavily relies on the
assumption of homogeneity of the spread of epidemic across the country, which is often not the
case. Furthermore, it cannot capture the possible interactions between the different areas of the
country which, as is well known, have played an important role in the diffusion of the epidemic.
We attempt to describe these important aspects by considering a multi-region extension of the
basic SIR model, to be used for the future forecasts. The basic SIR model is recalled in Section 2,
whereas its multi-region extension (mrSIR) is described in Section 3.
We also define another extension of the SIR model, called SI2 R2 , which describes a more refined
infection mechanism. Also for this model we propose a multi-region extension (mrSI2 R2 ). These
are described in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

SIR model

The basic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Removed) model for the initial spread of an epidemic disease
[5] (see also, e.g., [6, pp. 376–378] or [9]) is
ẋ =
ẏ =
ż

=

−βxy,
βxy − γy,
γy,
1

(1)

where:
• x is the number of susceptible,
• y is the number of infectictious,
• z is the number of removed,
and
• β is the coefficient of infection,
• γ is the coefficient of removal.
It is assumed that recovered people acquire some immunity [1] (or are dead), so that they are
no more susceptible. From (1), one easily realizes that:
S(t) = x(t) + y(t) + z(t) ≡ const.

(2)

We have used this simple model to predict, initially, the spread of the COVID-19 disease in Italy
[2] but, as is clear from the data available from the Italian Protezione Civile [7], the spread of the
disease is not homogeneous in the various regions of Italy. Another related question to be faced is
the effect in the disease diffusion due to migration of people from severely contaminated areas to
regions not yet affected, which causes the settlement of new transmission clusters. The basic SIR
model is not able to properly capture these collateral aspects, causing the predictions to become
less accurate in the long temporal range, as the spread of the epidemic was going on. In order
to cope with the inhomogeneous nature of the diffusion environment and the interactions between
areas with different contamination levels, we propose a multi-region generalization of the basic SIR
model.

Multi-region SIR (mrSIR) model

In order to generalize the model (1) to a scenario where there are n regions, with a different situation
of the epidemic, let us define

as the vectors of susceptible, infectious, and removed in each region (i.e., xi , yi , zi denote the
respective levels in the i-th region). In so doing, the basic model (1) now becomes:

where ◦ denotes the Hadamard (i.e., component-wise) product, and

coefficient of migration from region j to region i. Concerning matrix R, we then assume:

Conditions (6)-(7) can be cast in vector form as

thus providing the conservation property
S(t) =

[xi (t) + yi (t) + zi (t)] ≡ const,

which is the analogous of (2) for the present model. In componetwise form, (4) reads, by taking
into account (6)-(7):

SI2R2 model

This model, which can be regarded as a variant of the SEIRD model in [3] (see also [9]), subdivides
the population into the following categories:
• susceptible people, which may be infected by the disease;
• infectious people, not yet diagnosed, which may spread the disease;
• infectious diagnosed people, which have been quarantined;
• removed undiagnosed people by spontaneous recovery, which are no more infectious;
• removed diagnosed people, either by recovery or death.
1 For

Spain, we have used the data from Spanish Centro de Coordinación de Alertas y Emergencias Sanitarias [8].

3

The acronym SI2 R2 derives by the initials of the above five classes. Moreover, we take into account
that infectious people are diagnosed with a delay, due to the incubation period that precedes the
appearance of symptoms (see, e.g., [4]) and a further amount of time before the infected people are
actually tested. As in the case of the SIR model, it is assumed that recovered people acquire some
immunity (or are dead), so that they are no more susceptible. The model is as follows:
ẋ(t) =
ẏ1 (t) =

−βx(t)y1 (t),
βx(t)y1 (t) − σy1 (t − τ )s+ (y1 (t)) − γ1 y1 (t),

ẏ2 (t) =
ż1 (t) =

σy1 (t − τ )s+ (y1 (t)) − γ2 y2 (t),
γ1 y1 (t),

ż2 (t) =

γ2 y2 (t),

(10)

where:
• x(t) is the number of susceptible people at time t,
• y1 (t) is the number of infectious undiagnosed people at time t,
• y2 (t) is the number of infectious diagnosed people at time t,
• z1 (t) is the number of removed undiagnosed infectious people (by spontaneous recovery) at
time t,
• z2 (t) is the number of removed diagnosed infectious people (by recovery or death) at time t,
and
• β is the coefficient of infection,
• σ is the coefficient of transition to the illness,
• γi , i = 1, 2, are the coefficients of removal of undiagnosed and diagnosed infectious people,
respectively,
• τ is a delay time, occurring between the beginning of infectiousness and the diagnosys,
• finally,
s+ (y) =

(

1,

if y > 0,

0,

otherwise.

(11)

As is clear from the third equation in (10), a basic assumption in the model is that only infectious
undiagnosed people can spread the disease, whereas infectious diagnosed people are quarantined,
in some way.
(τ )

Remark 1 In the sequel, for sake of brevity, we shall use the notation y1 (t) to denote y1 (t − τ ).
For the same reason, the argument t will be often omitted.

From (10), by considering that the sum of the right-hand sides is identically zero, one easily
realizes that:
S(t) = x(t) + y1 (t) + y2 (t) + z1 (t) + z2 (t) ≡ const,
(12)
a conservation property similar to (2) of the SIR model. Even though a complete analysis of the
model will be done elsewhere, we also observe that, when the infectious diagnosed people reach their
“peak” (where ẏ2 = 0) with a value y2∗ , one has that the level of infectious undiagnosed people, τ
days before, was given by:
γ2
y1∗ = y2∗ .
σ
Moreover, as a rough approximation, one may assume, for example, γ1 ≈ γ2 , unless more refined
estimates are available for γ1 (an estimate of γ2 can be usually derived from the data).
As in the case of the SIR model, (10) may be not appropriate when the spread of the epidemic
is not homogeneous in different regions of a country, as is the case for the COVID-19 epidemic in
Italy and Spain [7, 8]. For this reason, in the next section we propose a multi-region generalization
of the basic SI2 R2 model (10).

Multi-region SI2R2 (mrSI2 R2 ) model

In order to generalize the model (10) to a scenario where there are n regions, with a different
situation of the epidemic, we proceed in a way similar to what done for the SIR model in Section 3.
Let us then define:

as the vectors with susceptible, undiagnosed infectious, diagnosed infectious, undiagnosed removed,
and diagnosed removed people, respectively, in each region. I.e.:
• xi is the level of susceptible people in region i;
• yi1 is the level of undiagnosed infectious people in region i;
• yi2 is the level of diagnosed infectious people in region i;
• zi1 is the level of removed undiagnosed infectious people in region i;
• zi2 is the level of removed diagnosed infectious people in region i.
In so doing, the basic model (10) becomes:
ẋ =

−B x ◦ y1 + Rx,

B x ◦ y1 − Σy1 ◦ s+ (y1 ) − C1 y1 + Ry1 ,

are the matrices with the transition to illness, and removal coefficients (of undiagnosed and diagnosed infectious, respectively) in each region. As in the case of the mrSIR model, we assume that
the entries of the migration matrix R satisfy (6)-(7), thus providing the conservation property
S(t) =

n
X

[xi (t) + yi1 (t) + yi2 (t) + zi1 (t) + zi2 (t)] ≡ const.

(16)

i=1

Clearly, (16) is the analogous of (12) for the multi-region version of the model.
Remark 2 As is clear from (14), we have allowed migration for susceptible, undiagnosed infectious,
and recovered undiagnosed people only. However, it is straightforward to generalize migration to
recovered diagnosed people, too, by distinguishing between cured and death people.
In componentwise form, (14) reads, by taking into account (6)-(7):
ẋi

Remark 3 As in the single region case, as an approximation in (17) one may assume
i = 1, . . . , n,

γi1 ≈ γi2 ,

(i.e., C1 ≈ C2 in (14)), in order to simplify the use of the model, unless better estimates are
available.
2 As

before, ◦ denotes the Hadamard (i.e., component-wise) product.

We conclude this note, by observing that both the mrSIR and the mrSI2 R2 models can be used
at different space scales, i.e.: regions within a country; countries within a continent or worldwide;
etc.
