With the continued spread of coronavirus, the task of forecasting distinctive
COVID-19 growth curves in different cities, which remain inadequately explained
by standard epidemiological models, is critical for medical supply and treatment1,2.
Predictions must take into account non-pharmaceutical interventions to slow the
spread of coronavirus, including stay-at-home orders, social distancing,
quarantine and compulsory mask-wearing, leading to reductions in intra-city
mobility and viral transmission3. Moreover, recent work associating coronavirus
with human mobility4,5 and detailed movement data6,7 suggest the need to consider
urban mobility in disease forecasts8,9. Here we show that by incorporating intracity mobility and policy adoption into a novel metapopulation SEIR model, we can
2

accurately predict complex COVID-19 growth patterns in U.S. cities ( R = 0.990).
Estimated mobility change due to policy interventions is consistent with empirical
observation from Apple Mobility Trends Reports10 (Pearson’s R = 0.872),
suggesting the utility of model-based predictions where data are limited. Our
model also reproduces urban “superspreading”11, where a few neighborhoods
account for most secondary infections across urban space, arising from uneven
neighborhood populations and heightened intra-city churn in popular
neighborhoods. Therefore, our model can facilitate location-aware mobility
reduction policy that more effectively mitigates disease transmission at similar
social cost. Finally, we demonstrate our model can serve as a fine-grained analytic
and simulation framework that informs the design of rational non-pharmaceutical
interventions policies.

In response to the rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of a
widely available vaccine, local health authorities worldwide have considered, debated,
and implemented a wide range of non-pharmaceutical intervention policies that are
deemed both necessary and effective to contain the spread of coronavirus12,13. Human
mobility control has become the centerpiece of the most common intervention measures,
including cancellation of social gatherings14–16, quarantine and stay-at-home orders17,
and suspension of public transportation18. Nevertheless, complex and distinctive
growth patterns associated with COVID-19 cases have ranged from exponential to
sublinear growth across cities19–21, requiring epidemiological models to be expressive
enough to account for different policy adoptions with their efficacy. Moreover, recent
studies have found accumulating evidence of “superspreading events” that suggest the
spatial heterogeneity of coronavirus risk in urban space and contradict the assumption
of a homogeneously mixing population underlying classic epidemiological models such
as SEIR22. These developments pose the pressing need for a simple while general
epidemiological model that can capture heterogeneous urban mobility and the varying
effect of public health intervention policies across cities to accurately predict COVID19 cases growth patterns even when detailed infection distribution and mobility data
are unavailable.
Here, we present a metapopulation SEIR model that explicitly incorporates intra-city
mobility patterns and systemic policy adoption. We model the urban space as a set of
spatially distributed neighborhoods, and use a general gravity model23 to capture intracity mobility behavior as mobility flows among neighborhoods. Inspired by Stouffer’s
law of opportunity-driven urban movement24, our gravity model predicts mobility flow
as proportional to neighborhood population and inversely proportional to the travel
distance. Atop the predicted mobility flows, we overlay a metapopulation SEIR model
to characterize the infection within each neighborhood and track inter-neighborhood
disease spread arising from mobility. This model allows us to jointly consider different
urban mobility patterns and local intervention policies in a principled way that
facilitates the prediction of complex COVID-19 growth patterns. Recent works
demonstrated the power of mobility data, when available, to forecast COVID-19
incidences5–7,25. We extend this line of research by considering a simple yet powerful
urban mobility model that can be easily generalized to any country or region without
empirical intra-city mobility data.
Simulation of the 20 most infectious U.S. counties demonstrates that our model can
accurately predict complex and distinct growth curves tracing COVID-19 cases in cities
2

( R =0.990). Our estimates of mobility change due to non-pharmaceutical interventions
are consistent with real-world observation derived from Apple Mobility Trends
Reports10 (Pearson’s R = 0.872), suggesting the power of our model-based predictions
even when human mobility data are lagging or limited. Our model can also characterize
the “superspreading” events in urban space through tracing the coronavirus spread
among urban neighborhoods, where a small portion (20%) of neighborhoods account

for a large portion (68.3%) of secondary infections. Moreover, model analysis reveals
that urban “superspreading” is a joint result of uneven urban population and heightened
intra-city churn associated with popular neighborhoods. We demonstrate that by
focusing on the regions predicted to have the highest infection risk, location-aware
mobility reduction policy can result in significantly more effective epidemic control at
similar social cost. This suggests the possibility of flexible and targeted urban epidemic
control policies. Moreover, our model can serve as a simulation framework for the costeffective evaluation of various hypothetical intervention measures. Simulation results
show the widely adopted mobility reduction, social distancing and quarantine policy
have significant effect on curb the transmission of coronavirus, and it is important to
put forward timely responses with adequate implementation. Overall, our model
facilitates the fine-grained analysis, evaluation, and rational design of nonpharmaceutical interventions policies for urban space.
Policy-aware metapopulation model for COVID-19 growth curve prediction
We use a metapopulation scheme to model the fine-grained disease spreading dynamics
within cities. This breaks down urban space into numerous neighborhoods with a
certain population, and maintains a separate SEIR model with its own susceptible (S),
exposed (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R) states for the subpopulation within each
neighborhood (see Extended Data Fig. 1). We use a gravity model to characterize
mobility flows between neighborhoods, mainly considering the cost of travel and the
attraction of social opportunity22(see Methods M1), i.e., the mobility flows are
predicted to be proportional to neighborhood population and inversely proportional to
the travel distance. Therefore, secondary infections occur within each neighborhood
based on simulation of the SEIR model, and disperse to other neighborhoods according
to the predicted mobility flows. We set three free parameters to capture the efficacy of
popular non-pharmaceutical intervention policies: (1) a learnable infection rate b to
account for social distancing policies, e.g., limiting social gathering12,13; (2) a learnable
quarantine rate k to account for the capacity of testing and quarantine17,26; (3) and a
learnable mobility level
to account for mobility reduction policies, e.g., stay-athome orders and suspension of public transportation18. Other epidemiological
parameters are set according to recent COVID-19 studies (see Extended Data Table 1).
Urban population distribution is derived from the open source WorldPop database27. To
characterize the behavioral change due to intervention policies, we segment the
simulation period into two parts based on the announcement of nationwide emergency
status in the U.S. and fit separate parameters for each period (Extended Data Fig.2). We
calibrate the parameters of our model based on official counts of confirmed cases28.
We evaluate our model with the task of reproducing growth curves of COVID-19
confirmed cases in 20 U.S. counties from the beginning of the pandemic through April
30. These counties, often coterminous with U.S. cities (e.g., Chicago and Cook County),
demonstrate complex and distinctive growth patterns (Fig.1a, red dot lines), which can
be categorized into four types of increase: linear (Hudson, King, etc.), concave (Bergen,

Miami-Dade, Nassau, etc.), convex (Cook, Davidson, Los Angeles, etc.), and Sshaped—convex then concave (Harris, New Orleans, Will). All these distinct curves
2

can be accurately reproduced by our model, with R scores above 0.99 in all cities
(Fig.1a, blue lines). On the contrary, the standard SEIR model fails to reproduce these
empirical growth curves, only predicting exponential or no growths with R0 > 1 and

R0 < 1, respectively (Fig.1a, green lines)1. Moreover, we theoretically prove that our
model is able to reproduce complex growth curves with different intra-city mobility
levels (see Methods M2), which greatly extend the expressive power of classic
epidemiological models. Further results echo this finding that different levels of intracity mobility have a significant impact on the shape of city-level growth curves
(Extended Data Fig.3). These results justify the need to incorporate intra-city mobility
behavior to characterize complex and distinctive growth curves of COVID-19 cases,
and provide a microscopic foundation to rationalize them from the perspective of
human behavior. We further evaluate our model by predicting future confirmed cases
within two weeks, i.e., May 1-14 (Fig.1b). The results demonstrate that our model
significantly outperforms the standard SEIR model with reduced normalized root mean
square error (NRMSE) from 7.222 to 0.294. When we perform a correlation analysis
on the mobility reduction estimated by our model and real-world observations derived
from Apple Mobility Trends Reports10 (Fig.1c), our model accurately estimates
behavior changes by solely observing the growth curves of confirmed cases (Pearson’s
R= 0.872). These results suggest that our model can be robustly generalized to cities
and regions where mobility data is lagging or limited.
Reproducing and rationalizing the superspreading events in urban space
The events of superspreading have been widely observed in epidemics like SARS,
Measles and Smallpox22, as well as COVID-19, where a small portion of infected
people and locations are responsible for a disproportionate number of secondary
infections. Researchers have identified accumulating superspreading events of COVID19 through case study29,30, phylogenetic analysis17,31 and statistical evaluation32,33.
Despite its importance, superspreading cannot be adequately explained by the standard
SEIR model, because of the fundamental assumption of homogeneous population
mixing. We demonstrate that the population distribution in a city mostly follows an
exponential pattern with high Gini index (Extended Data Fig. 4). As a result, researchers
proposed to characterize the superspreading events with dispersion parameter k , which
measures how the transmissive power of each individual deviates from the general
population22,30 with a negative binomial model. However, this statistical point of view
reveals limited understanding about the underlying behavioral mechanism of
superspreading, e.g., intra-city mobility behavior. Moreover, recent research found
evidence that superspreading events can be better characterized with fat-tailed power
law distribution33, which further suggested its link to human behavior patterns. To
bridge this gap, we examine the mechanism of superspreading events through the

analytic framework provided by our model, tuned to analyze the spatial heterogeneity
of intra-city disease spreading dynamics.
To evaluate the infection risk in different neighborhoods, we use the infectee-infector
ratio as a proxy to examine the selected U.S. counties, which is defined as the average
number of secondary infections per infected person in each neighborhood. We rank the
neighborhoods based on the infectee-infector ratio, and calculate the cumulative
distribution function of the number of infected and secondary infections (Fig. 2a). If
the infection risk is spatially homogeneous in urban space, we expect the cumulative
distribution function grows linearly as the black dot line. However, our model
reproduces a highly skewed distribution where the most infectious 20% of
neighborhoods are responsible for 68.3% of secondary infections. The Gini index also
captures the unevenness in the spatial distribution of secondary infections and infected
people34, with a score of 0.630 and 0.663, respectively. More importantly, the
superspreading events reproduced by our model have similar statistical distribution
with real-world observations, where the simulated dispersion parameters are
0.208~0.215 (see Extended Data Fig.5) falling in the empirically observed range of
0.147~0.66735. It indicates our model can effectively extend the expressive power of
the standard SEIR model in terms of adequately reproducing the empirically observed
superspreading events35.
Recent research pointed out that urban population distribution36 and intra-city mobility
behavior25 might be related to the superspreading events. Thus, by leveraging our model
as a simulation framework, we aim to shed light on how these two factors impact on
the superspreading. The effect of uneven urban population distribution is examined in
Fig.2b and c, where the intra-city mobility factor is controlled by replacing the gravity
model with random movement. We can observe that if the population is distributed
evenly in urban space, then the superspreading events will completely disappear
(Fig.2b). On the contrary, if we preserve the real-world population distribution, the
superspreading events can be reproduced, but of a much lower level with the Gini index
of 0.198 and 0.090 respectively (Fig.2c). These observations combined to suggest that
the uneven distribution of urban population is indeed an important factor, but it only
accounts for a portion of the overall superspreading events, which leads us to examine
the role of intra-city mobility behavior. The gravity model we use to capture the intracity mobility mainly considers two factors, i.e., the decreasing travel probability with
distance and the increasing travel probability with population. To examine the role of
each factor, we evaluate two variants of mobility model that only keep one factor
respectively. When we combine real-world population distribution and the mobility
model that only considers the distance factor, our model reproduces a similar level of
superspreading events as the combination of real-world population distribution and
random movement (see Fig.2d). Besides, if we adopt the mobility model that only
considers the population factor, we reproduce a strong superspreading effect with Gini
index of 0.632 and 0.539 for secondary infections and infected persons (see Fig.2e),
which are similar with the results of the complete model in Fig.2a. Therefore, these

results suggest that the superspreading events are a joint result of uneven urban
population distribution and heightened intra-city churn associated with popular
neighborhoods.
Evaluating location-aware mobility reduction policy in U.S. counties
Mobility reduction policy has been one of the most adopted non-pharmaceutical
interventions that aims to curb the coronavirus spread in urban space7,37. However,
large-scale mobility reduction schemes like city-wide lockdowns often cause great
socioeconomic consequence38. Since there is high spatial heterogeneity of infection risk
in urban space, a promising solution is to design location-aware, targeted mobility
reduction policy that achieves better trade-off between epidemic control and social cost.
Here, we investigate this possibility through the simulation of limiting the intra-city
mobility of several selected neighborhoods. We control the social cost as the overall
population size of selected neighborhoods (5% of the city population), and evaluate the
policy efficacy as the percentage of confirmed cases that are prevented.
Highly populated neighborhoods are inherently more vulnerable to coronavirus
transmission36. Thus, a naive solution will be to control the mobility of the top
populated neighborhoods. However, due to intra-city mobility behavior, the infection
risk does not solely depend on the population size. Although the population size and
infectee-infector ratio of neighborhoods have a relatively high correlation (spearman
correlation = 0.74), the infectee-infector ratio still has a significant portion of variance
that cannot be adequately explained by population size (Fig.3a). Specifically, if we
choose to control the mobility of the top-populated neighborhoods, 21.0% of overall
confirmed cases can be avoided, which outperforms the random selection baseline
(Fig.3b). On the contrary, if we select the most infectious neighborhoods predicted by
our model, the overall infection can be significantly reduced by 44.8% (Fig.3b). These
results suggest our model can indeed inform the design of more cost-effective locationaware mobility reduction policy.
To examine the source of different efficacy, we visualize the selected neighborhoods in
two counties as case study (Fig.3c and d). The case of Los Angeles county (L.A.) shows
the baseline policy focused only on population density would miss the high infection
risk that occurs in less populous neighborhoods around central L.A., because it cannot
model these neighborhoods’ mobility flows with the nearby and densely populated
neighborhoods (Fig.3c). Similarly, our model predicts that the peninsulas surrounding
the Tampa area has a smaller infection risk since it has longer distance with most
populated neighborhoods (Fig.3d). More detailed analysis suggests the location-aware
mobility reduction policy informed by our model can also better alleviate the
superspreading events (Extended Data Fig. 6).
Quantifying the effect of intervention policies
To estimate the effect of various intervention policies on controlling coronavirus spread,

we evaluate our model in 20 U.S. counties with different parameter settings that
simulate the implementation of the widely adopted interventions, e.g., mobility
reduction, social distancing, and quarantine (Fig.4a-c). Simulation shows 30% higher
intra-city mobility will lead to nearly threefold overall infections (2.93 times; IQR 1.577.24), and 30% less intra-city mobility will halve the number of cases (0.525 times;
IQR 0.237-0.783). The average observed mobility drop in U.S. counties during the
pandemic is around 30.3% (Extended Data Fig.7, with IQR 0.227-0.392), which
suggests that current mobility behavior changes have been effective in reducing
coronavirus transmission. Besides, a 10% infection rate increase multiplies citywide
infections by 2.10 (interquartile range, IQR 1.51-3.30), while a 10% decrease almost
halves the infections (0.524 times; IQR 0.231-0.661). This suggests the great
importance of reducing the infection rate of coronavirus, which can be achieved through
the implementation of personal hygiene and social distancing policies, such as wearing
masks and cancelling large gatherings39,40. Quarantine is another widely adopted policy
to contain the secondary infection of confirmed and suspected cases41. Our model
predicts that the number of confirmed cases will be 29% higher given a 10% decrease
in quarantine rate (1.29 times; IQR 1.06-2.38), while a 10% increase in quarantine rate
will prevent approximately 78% of citywide infections (0.221 times; IQR 0.07390.525). This asymmetric effect of quarantine rate suggests the necessity of ensuring that
testing capacity and hospital resources are sufficient. These capacities can greatly
reduce overall infections once they pass a critical threshold. Finally, timely responses
to COVID-19 growth are often considered critical in combating the virus42. To explore
this effect with our model, we shifted the time point of behavior change to simulate the
potential effect of different response time. We find that a delay of 10 days causes 3.26
times higher overall infections (IQR 1.58-9.53), while 10 days earlier reduces the
infections by 57.5% (0.425 times; IQR 0.12-0.71). These experiment results indicate
the widely adopted interventions, like mobility reduction, social distancing and
quarantine, and timely responses play important roles in curbing virus spread and
flattening the growth curves.
Discussion
Our model aims to reconstruct the fine-grained transmission process of COVID-19 in
cities with minimum real-world data. We show that by only observing the population
distribution and the number of confirmed cases, our model can accurately reproduce
the complex growth curves of COVID-19 cases and forecast the future trends. Our
model provides a theoretical framework to explain the distinctive growth curves in
different U.S. urban counties from the perspective of intra-city mobility. Furthermore,
our model can reproduce and explain the superspreading events in cities resulting from
the uneven distribution of urban population and the assumption of spatially
heterogeneous mobility. In these ways, our model markedly augments the expressive
power of current epidemiological models. Besides, the minimum data requirement
ensures it can be easily generalized to cities and regions without fine-grained mobility
data.

There are two limitations of our study. First, our parsimonious model only incorporates
three learnable parameters that account for infection rate, quarantine rate and mobility
level. We do not consider all fine-grained features that might influence the spread of
coronavirus, such as weather43, changing attitudes towards containment policies44, and
population demographics like age26 and socioeconomic status6. Second, the embedded
mobility model reconstructs intra-city mobility in aggregate as the mobility flux
between neighborhoods, abstracting over individuals and unable to pinpoint specific
infections. Nevertheless, analysis demonstrates that our model can accurately trace
citywide COVID-19 cases, suggesting its expressive sufficiency for characterizing
urban viral transmission dynamics. Moreover, the minimum model setting improves its
robustness and generalizability.
Our results have several implications for non-pharmaceutical and public health
interventions and benefit the design of reopening policies. Our analysis suggests that
the widely observed superspreading events are not solely due to the randomness of rare
events, but also systematically linked with uneven urban population distribution and
the disproportional mobility attractiveness of populous neighborhoods. It further
demonstrates the need to jointly consider urban environment and human mobility
behavior to effectively curb superspreading events. We also show how infection risk is
spatially heterogeneous in urban space, and our model can predict the most infectious
locations. This suggests the possibility of designing targeted and location-aware
mobility reduction policies that achieve better performance with identical social cost.
Next, model analysis demonstrates that estimated mobility change is consistent with
real-world observations in Apple Mobility Trends Reports. This affirms that our model
can offer insights into fine-grained urban transmission dynamics and be robustly
transferred to cities without mobility data. Finally, our model can be used to
comparatively and inexpensively evaluate the effect of public health interventions,
including social distancing, stay-at-home orders, quarantine, and dynamically
customized mobility reduction policies that substantially curb the spread of coronavirus.

Methods:
M1 Meta-population SEIR model
The standard SEIR models use ordinary differential equations (ODE) to trace the
epidemic development, which divides the population into four status: susceptible (S),
exposed (E), infected (I) and recovered (R). Besides, one fundamental assumption
behind the standard SEIR model is homogeneous population mixing, and hence each
susceptible individual will have similar infection risk. As a result, it can neither
reproduce the complex growth curves of COVID-19 confirmed cases1 nor explain the
mechanism of superspreading events30.
Here, we aim to extend the power of the standard SEIR model by introducing a metapopulation framework that can consider fine-grained intra-city mobility behavior.

Specifically, we divide the urban space into numerous neighborhoods, and maintain a
separate SEIR process for the sub-population in each neighborhood. The overall city
population is divided into the neighborhood based on real-world population
distributions27. In each simulation epoch, our model has two stages to trace epidemic
development and population mixing, respectively. In the stage of epidemic
development, we compute the changes of population status according to the following
equations in each neighborhood:

ds n
= - b s n e n - b i n e n + Input S (t )
dt
de n
1
= (1 - wi ) b s n e n + (1 - wi ) b s ni n - e n + Input E (t )

= wi b s n e n + wi b s ni n + e n - k i n - g i n + Input I (t )
dt

n
dr
= k i n + g i n + Input R (t )
dt

where s n , en , i n , r n are the susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered people in
neighborhood n . b is the infection rate, wi is the ratio that secondary infections
immediately show symptoms and change to infected status, t is average incubation
time of exposed persons, and k denotes the quarantine rate that infected persons are
removed from the population.
For the infection states for the whole city, we have

S = å sn
n

E = å en
n

I = å in

.

n

R = å rn
n

Besides, the input terms are determined based on the incoming and outgoing population
due to intra-city mobility. Specifically, in the stage of population mixing, we simulate
the intra-city mobility behavior based on the following gravity model:

mij = M

Nir N qj
exp(dij / r )

,

where 𝑀 is the mobility level depicting the intensity of intra-city mobility, N i and

N j are the population size of the originated and designated neighborhoods, and dij is
the Manhattan distance between them. r , q , r are empirical coefficients we set based
on recent urban mobility research23. This gravity model assumes the mobility flows
between neighborhoods are negatively correlated travel distance and positively
correlated with the population size, which is inspired by Stouffer’s law of opportunitydriven movement24. We assume the mobility flows have similar distribution of epidemic
status as the originated neighborhoods and sum them up as the input terms in designated
neighborhoods. We set the infection rate b , quarantine rate k and mobility level 𝑀
as learnable parameters to estimate the efficacy of intervention measures like social
distancing, mass testing and quarantine, and stay-at-home order. Besides, we set other
epidemiological parameters based on the recent COVID-19 research (see Extended
Data Table.1).
M2 Theoretical analysis of complex growth patterns
To evaluate our model’s capacity in capturing the complex growth patterns of COVID19 confirmed cases, we consider two extreme scenarios of our model. First, we consider
a complete lockdown scenario ( M ® 0 ) that the coronavirus is contained in the several
initial neighborhoods. Therefore, the effective population is the combined population
of these neighborhoods, which will be significantly smaller than the whole population
( N eff ! N ). It is equivalent to an exponential depletion of susceptible people that
resembles the self-containment mechanism in the recent SIR-X model, which has been
proved that can reproduce sub-exponential growth curves1. Moreover, our model
provides a micro foundation to explain the sub-exponential growth of COVID-19 cases
from the urban mobility behavior perspective.
Another extreme case is the highly efficient city-wide population mixing ( M ® ¥ ). In
this scenario, the population mixing stage in each simulation epoch will make the
persons of different status will distribute proportionately across the neighborhoods
based on the size of each subpopulation. Therefore, the epidemic development stage
of each neighborhood run a similar SEIR model but with different population sizes:

ds n
= - b s nen - b i nen
dt
de n
1
= (1 - wi ) b s n e n + (1 - wi ) b s ni n - e n
dt
t
n
di
1
= wi b s n e n + wi b s ni n + e n - k i n - g i n
dt
t
n
dr
= k in + g in
dt

where s n , en , i n , r n have similar proportion composition in each neighborhood. For
example, the number of susceptible people in neighborhood n can be computed as

s n + en + i n + r n
S
S+E+I+R
= pn S

sn =

where pn is defined as the proportion of population in neighborhood n .
Therefore, the city-wide epidemic development is a linear sum of a set of homogeneous
SEIR models. For example, the coronavirus transmission (the decrease of susceptible
population) occur in each simulation epoch can be computed as follow:

dS ds1 ds 2
ds m
=
+
+!+
dt

dt
1 1

= -( b s e + b s i ) - ( b s 2 e 2 + b s 2i 2 ) - ! - ( b s m e m + b s mi m )
= -( b SE + b SI ) p12 - ( b SE + b SI ) p22 - ! - ( b SE + b SI ) pm2

= - ç ç å pi2 b ÷ SE + ç å pi2 b ÷ SI ÷

è i =1

Similar equations can be derived for exposed, infected, and recovered populations.
Therefore, we can see that the city-wide epidemic development is equivalent to a SEIR
model with different parameters, where the equivalent infection rate is

b equ

æ m 2 ö
= ç å pi b ÷ . As a result, it can reproduce the exponential growth curves in the

standard SEIR model.
Our proposed metapopulation model lies between these two extreme cases, with the
mobility level parameter ranges from complete lockdown ( M ® 0 ) to highly efficient
population mixing ( M ® 0 ). Therefore, by changing the mobility level, our model can
reproduce the complex growth curves ranging from sub-linear to exponential (see
Extended Data Fig.3). As a result, our model is provably expressive to capture the
complex growth curves of COVID-19 confirmed cases.

Extended Data: (Figures and Tables)

Extended Data Fig.1| Illustration of the proposed meta-population model. We
segment the urban space into numerous neighborhoods, and divide the whole city
population into subpopulation based on them. Separate SEIR model is run on the
subpopulation within each neighborhood, and the susceptible, exposed, infected, and
recovered individuals are mixed across neighborhoods according to the mobility flow
predicted by the gravity model.

Extended Data Fig.2| The number of COVID-19 intervention policies announced
in the United States. Most policies are released at the end of March after the
Declaration of National Emergency. Thus, we choose April 1st as the time point of
behavior change.

Extended Data Fig.3| The estimated growth curves of COVID-19 cases with
different mobility levels and transmission rates. Color of lines represent different
mobility levels compared with maximum mobility, where all the people are involved in
circulation. Different mobility levels will greatly change the shape of growth curves,
where low mobility levels are more likely to result in sub-exponential growth curves.

Extended Data Fig.4| Heterogeneity of population distribution in cities. Population
distributions of selected U.S. counties demonstrate strong heterogeneity where top
populated neighborhoods account for considerable population.

Extended Data Fig.5| Dispersion parameter of 20 United States counties in
different periods of epidemic. We examine the dispersion parameter of total infected

people (including exposed people and infected people) in different time periods and
different scenarios. These periods include the first quarter day, the middle day, the last
quarter day and the final day. Smaller dispersion parameter represents greater
dispersion. When it is smaller than 1 and greater than 0, significant superspreading
exists.

Extended Data Fig.6 | The effect of superspreading events under different mobility
reduction policies. It is measured by the Gini indexes of the spatial distribution of
secondary infections and infected persons. The policy informed by our model results in
smaller spatial unevenness of infection risk, which indicates less superspreading events.

Extended Data Fig.7 | Mobility drops in selected U.S. counties before and after
March 25. We evaluate the real-world mobility drops from Apple Mobility Trends
Reports10. The mobility drop has a median value of 30.3% (shown in the vertical dashed
line), with IQR 0.227-0.392.
