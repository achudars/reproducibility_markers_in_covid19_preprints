ABSTRACT
The rapid spread of the novel corona virus, SARS-CoV-2,
has prompted an unprecedented response from governments
across the world. A third of the world population have been
placed in varying degrees of lockdown, and the Internet has
become the primary medium for conducting most businesses
and schooling activities. This paper aims to provide a multiprospective account of Internet performance during the first
wave of the pandemic. We investigate the performance of the
Internet control plane and data plane from a number of globally spread vantage points. We also look closer at two case
studies. First, we look at growth in video traffic during the
pandemic, using traffic logs from a global video conferencing
provider. Second, we leverage a country-wide deployment
of measurement probes to assess the performance of mobile
networks during the outbreak. We find that the lockdown has
visibly impacted almost all aspects of Internet performance.
Access networks have experienced an increase in peak and
off-peak end to end latency. Mobile networks exhibit significant changes in download speed, while certain types of
video traffic has increased by an order of magnitude. Despite
these changes, the Internet seems to have coped reasonably
well with the lockdown traffic.

INTRODUCTION

In the spring of 2020, a third of the world population has
been placed in varying degrees of lockdown to slow down
the spread of the novel corona virus, SARS-CoV-2. Public
services, businesses, schools and universities around the
world have been shut down. Virtual classrooms and video
conferences quickly replaced the regular classroom and the

physical office space. The state of our economies immediately
became contingent on the Internet infrastructure, further
emphasising the critical role of the Internet to our livelihood.
This unprecedented situation has strained both access networks and the backbone of the Internet. Several network
operators have reported excessive growth in traffic. For example, Telefonica’s data traffic growth in March alone has
overtaken its normal annual growth [1]. Industry and regulatory reports have since shown that the Internet has, in
general, coped reasonably well with lockdown traffic [10, 11,
14, 22, 29, 30, 37]. However, a number of studies have also
pointed to variations in performance, increase in outages
and under-performing access networks [15, 24, 27, 33]
Almost all available accounts of Internet performance during the lockdown are from the point of view of a single
operator , a few operators or a few IXPs. This paper aims to
provide a broader multi-perspective account on the Internet
performance performance and stability during the first wave
of Covid-19. We examine how the global routing system and
the Domain Name Systems (DNS) have coped. In addition,
we analyze latency between thousands of vantage points
worldwide enabled by RIPE Atlas [4] to determine the impact on performance change in Internet usage during the
first wave of the pandemic. Using traffic logs from a global
network that facilitates high quality video conferencing, we
examine growth in video traffic during the pandemic. Finally,
we take a closer look at the performance of data traffic in a
mobile network in a Western European country to examine
the impact of the lockdown.
This approach disentangles us from the limited single-view
approach and allows for examining effects beyond a simple

binary classification. For instance, examining the routing
system allows for capturing effects like the link between network stability and human intervention. Also, this approach
allows us to look at differences between different countries.
The traffic from the global video interconnect gives an idea
about how businesses in different regions have coped with
the lockdown and may provide an input to evaluating the
economical impact.
We find that the pandemic and the following lockdown
measures have had a clear impact on the Internet. BGP routing dynamics in the Internet have changed during the lockdown period, with a reduction in transient routing changes
and increased signs of traffic engineering. Increased traffic
volumes have stressed the capacity limits of many networks,
and we observe increased delays in most countries where
lockdown measures have been imposed. We also see a clear
increase in outages during the pandemic, with European
countries being over-represented. The performance of DNS
root servers, on the other hand, does not seem to be affected.
Our case study from a global video conferencing network
indicates a sharp increase in video traffic globally, with traffic
levels increasing more than ten times for certain customers.
Likewise, the performance of two mobile networks in a Western European country were clearly affected, with reduced
data speeds in densely populated residential areas and increased speeds outside urban areas as people travel less and
stay at home.
The rest of this paper is organized with an initial discussion of impact on the control plane by analyzing BGP data
in Sec. 2.4, followed by an analysis of impact on the data
plane in Sec. 3.3, outages during the outbreak in Sec. 4.2, a
study of the impact of DNS is provided in Sec. 5.2, a case
study of a video conferencing provider in Sec.6.3, and a case
study using a country-wide measurement platform for mobile broadband performance before and after the pandemic
in Sec. 7. The results are discussed and compared to related
work in Sec. 8 and Sec. 9. Finally, Sec. 10 concludes the paper.

IMPACT ON CONTROL PLANE

We investigate whether the lockdown had a visible impact
on the interdomain routing system. To this end, we focus
on three aspects: impact on the growth of the system, its
dynamics and stability.

2.1

Dataset

We use BGP routing table dumps and update traces from the
Routeviews Oregon-IX collector. We focus on two periods,
the 1st of January to the 30th of April 2019 and 2020, respectively. These two periods allow us to compare the same

months before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. The chosen collector peers with up to 49 monitors from over 35
Autonomous systems (ASes).

2.2

Impact on growth

We record a slower growth in the size of the default-free IPv4
routing table in the period January-April 2020 compared with
the same period in 2019. The growth rate was 3.2% in 2019,
but it has dropped to 1.7% in 2020. The number of newly
appearing autonomous systems is comparable in both years,
albeit a bit slower in 2020. While this slowness might be
related to the general slowness of business during lockdown,
the depletion of IPv4 address space is a possible explanation
too. We also investigate the structure of the routing table in
terms of type of prefixes. In particular, we divide prefixes
into top, lonely, delegated and deaggregated. Top and Lonely
prefixes are not covered by any other routed prefix. Lonely
prefixes do not cover any routed prefix, whereas top prefixes
cover more specifics (i.e. longer sub-prefixes). Address space
classified as deaggregated and delegated is covered by a less
specific prefix in the routing table. Deaggreagated space is
advertised by the same AS that advertises the less specific
prefix, while delegated space is advertised by a different
AS. Interestingly, we measure a slight drop in the fraction
of both deaggregated and delegated – about 2% for each.
This is counter-intuitive, since one could expect an increase
in deploying traffic engineering mechanisms like prefixes
deaggregtion as a response to rising traffic demands. One
explanation can be that networks have resorted to other
approaches for deploying traffic engineering like the use
of communities. Another possible explanation is that traffic
growth has mainly impacted domestic routes. In other words,
telecommuting, homeschooling and online public services
often involve exchanging data between users in the same
country and even within a limited geographic scope.

2.3

Impact on routing dynamics

We also investigate the growth in BGP updates, since this
gives an idea about the stability of the interdomain routing
system. We expect, as previous work has shown [17], the
number of updates to grow as a function of the routing
system size. Surprisingly, however, the visual inspection of
daily updates time series show that the majority of monitors
exhibit a decreasing trend. Figure 1 shows the timeseries
of the total daily updates that are sent by two monitors in
AT&T and Sprint networks, respectively. Both timeseries
exhibit a drop starting at the end of March, which coincides
with the period where many countries took drastic lockdown
measures.
To rigorously confirm and quantify the visual observations, we apply the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend detection test

Table 1: Trend in daily update time series.

Table 1 summarizes the results of the MK test. Unlike in
2019, 86% of the monitors exhibit no trend or decreasing
trend in 2020. A tiny 13.3% show an increasing trend in 2020
compared to over half of the monitors in 2019. The median
slope of the increasing trend in 2019 is 2082 updates/day,
while the median slope of the decreasing trend in 2020 is
-2105 updates/day. The similarity between these slopes is
very interesting. These results indicate that the cause of
daily increase in the sustained rate of BGP updates has been
muted in the first few months of 2020. Hence, resulting in
either a stable number of updates or the complete reversal
of the daily trend.
A closer look at the monitors with an increasing trend
reveals that half of them have experienced an upward level
shift in the number of daily updates, which is interpreted as
an increasing trend. Previous work have shown that level
shifts in BGP updates often coincide with effects local to
the monitors e.g. misconfigurations [18]. Notably, over half
of the monitors with a decreasing trend in 2019 exhibit a

downward level shift. We conjecture, accordingly, that both
the decreasing trend in 2019 and increasing trend in 2020
reflect effects local to the respective monitors.

2.4

Impact on routing changes

In order to narrow down the possible causes behind the decrease in daily BGP updates, We investigate the underlying
routing changes. To this end, we group routing updates that
arrive close in time into routing events. As in [39], we consider consecutive updates, concerning a routing prefix 𝑝, that
are spaced by no more than 70 seconds as part of the same
underlying routing change. More specifically, we start by
scanning the timeseries of updates and once we encounter
an update for a prefix 𝑝, we flag it as a start of a routing
event. The next update is considered as part of the same
event, if it is no longer than 70 seconds out. Otherwise, we
label the previous event as finished and start a new event.
The 70 seconds thresholds is chosen to account for the effect
of the MRAI timer that delays BGP updates transmission.
We next classify routing events according to the starting
𝑃𝐴𝑠𝑡 and ending 𝑃𝐴𝑒𝑛 AS paths into: 1) AAC: 𝑃𝐴𝑒𝑛 is different from 𝑃𝐴𝑠𝑡 , 2) AAD: 𝑃𝐴𝑒𝑛 is the same as 𝑃𝐴𝑠𝑡 and we
see at least one different AS Path during the event, 3) AAS:
𝑃𝐴𝑒𝑛 is the same as 𝑃𝐴𝑠𝑡 and we do not see any different
AS Path during the event. 𝑃𝐴𝑒𝑛 and 𝑃𝐴𝑠𝑡 may have different
path attributes (e.g. communities and MED values), 4) AW:
the event ends by withdrawing the affected prefix from the
routing table i.e., 𝑃𝐴𝑒𝑛 = ∅, 5) WA: the event announces a
new or a previously withdrawn prefix i.e., 𝑃𝐴𝑠𝑡 = ∅.
Figure 2 depicts the breakdown of daily updates by event
type for a monitor in AT&T network. The updates related to
the AAD events have dropped starting early March, while

those related to AAC and AAS have either slightly risen
or became more erratic. The contributions of AW and WA
events have remained stable. The above observations apply
to most monitors that exhibit a decreasing trend in daily
updates. This indicates that most decrease is related to the
drop in AAD changes. Since these changes dominate the mix
of updates, the increase in AAC and AAS changes does not
seem to offset the decrease.

Figure 3: Routing changes comparison
AAD changes communicate routing disturbances that are
likely caused by transient routing changes e.g. router restarts
or re-configurations. AAC changes reflect longer term routing changes, while AAS reflects configuration changes within
the origin AS like changing communities. The latter two are
often used to influence traffic, i.e. traffic engineering. The
two panels in Fig. 3 are scatter plots of the average daily
updates related to path disturbance and traffic engineering,
for 2019 and 2020, respectively. We plot the daily averages
for the period January-February on the x-axis and daily averages for the period March-April on y axis. The straight line is
the 𝑦 = 𝑥 line. In 2019, the contribution of path disturbance
has increased with time, while those related to traffic engineering have mostly remained stable (i.e. hovering around
𝑦 = 𝑥). The path disturbance trend is completely reversed
in 2020, which also shows an increase in updates related to
traffic engineering.

Takeaways. The COVID-19 outbreak appears to have
impacted the global routing system in several ways. Transient routing changes have evidently decreased during the
lockdown period, while traffic engineering have picked up.
We hypothesize that several networks have frozen unnecessary maintenance and upgrades, thus resulting in a less
chatty routing system. This gives a rare window into the
composition of routing dynamics, which can help future
work understanding and modeling BGP dynamics.

IMPACT ON DATA PLANE

In this section, we seek to investigate whether different
country-level lockdown measures impacted the data plane
performance. Note that the form of the pandemic lockdown
were different between countries – from severe restrictions
on mobility in some countries like Italy or Spain to only banning international travel in other countries like Sweden [1].
We use the term lockdown date to refer to the day when
governments declared such measures.

3.1

Dataset

We use successful ping measurements collected from the
RIPE Atlas platform [4]. For most of the countries, the pandemic lockdowns occurred during the second half of March
2020 [3]. Hence, we choose March and April 2020 as our measurement period. Prior to our analysis, we filter our data by
only considering RIPE Atlas probe pairs for which we collect
more than 300 measurements per day. With this requirement,
we include approximately 96% of the (source, destination)
probe pairs each day. We focus in our analysis on domestic
measurements within each country. We look at countries for
which we collect data both before and after the lockdown
dates. Our filtered data covers 66 countries from across the
world – 41 from Europe, 12 from Asia Pacific region, 8 and 2
from South and North America, and 3 from Africa.

3.2

Impact on delay within countries

Our goal is to understand whether we observe changes in the
delay values within a country after the reported lockdown
date. Hence, for each country we analyze the period before
and after this date. To this end, we take the following steps.
For each ping measurement, we compute the average RTT
value. Next, for each country we group these values per
hour and compute the median as well as the 5th and 95th
percentiles. For each of these metrics, we further compute
the average across all the values within one week before the
lockdown date. We compute the similar averages for the first
week after the same date. Finally, we compute the percentage
of increase or decrease of these averages after the lockdown
for each country.

has increased/decreased for the different thresholds. We find
an increase in the 5th percentile percentage (red lines) for
half of the considered countries. 86% of these countries experience up to 10% change in this metric. When considering the
95th percentile (blue lines) we find that 65% of the countries
experience an increase in this percentage during the week
after the lockdown date. We note, however, a high variability
in this percentage. The increase in the 5th percentile hints at
a general increase in traffic across the day (i.e. the minimum
level of network utilization has increased).

Case studies

We further analyze selected countries for which we observe
a change in both the 5th and 95th percentile delays. Table 2
lists the top countries for which we observe an increase in
both values.
1 Our

results indicate similar trends when considering two or one week as
the study period before and after the reported lockdown date.

RTT values increase. For one third of the considered countries, we observe an increase in the delay values. In Europe,
Italy and Spain are two of the countries where the pandemic
had severe effects. Consequently, the local governments imposed national lockdown measurements that included general confinement of the population at home, travel bans
within and outside the country and closing of non-essential
businesses, universities and schools [1]. Italy imposed these
measures from the 9th of March, while Spain declared the
emergency state on the 14th of March. For both countries we
note a clear diurnal pattern in the 95th percentile RTT values
after the lockdown dates (see the two top panels in Fig. 5) ,
which hints at periods of congestion in the networks where
the RIPE probes are located. The extent of the increase in
the 95th percentile exceeds 50% in some days. Moreover, we
note short-lived increases in the 5th percentile, i.e., during
14th and 17th of March for Italy and Spain, respectively.
RTT values decrease. Our analysis shows that for some
countries, the RTT values actually decreased after the lockdown date. We manually inspect the top countries, and find
that for most of these the decrease is due to level shifts in
the RTT that could be caused by path changes or loss of
high-delay monitors (i.e. measurements artefacts). In some
cases the decrease stems from the fact governments in some
countries have taken a gradual approach to lockdown attempting several policies on the way. Thus rendering the
final lockdown date inconsequential to the impact on the
Internet. Turkey is an example of a such country We find that
delay has started to increase prior to the reported lockdown
date. As shown in Fig. 5 the 95th percentile of the RTT values
increased up to four-folds from the second week of March.
We also observe diurnal patterns during weekdays in both
the 5th and 95th percentiles. A closer analysis of the pandemic response timeline shows that the Turkish government
have imposed gradual measures that spread across more than
one month. Schools and universities were closed for three
weeks from the 12th of March, entry to some provinces was
banned on the 3rd of April, and a four-day lockdown period
was announced from the 23rd of April [7]. Our collected data
clearly indicates the impact of this period on the delay values.
However, considering only the four-day lockdown period
indicates a decreasing trend in delay.
Iran was one of the first countries, after China, to report
a high number of infections. The government imposed a
national lockdown on the 14th of March. The inter-Iran delay
timeseries (Figure 5) shows a short-lived increases in the
RTT values six days prior to the lockdown dates. A closer
analysis shows this increase is linked to one of the RIPE
probes located in AS60256. Comparing the first week of
March with period after the lockdown day, we do not record
significant differences in delay.

A Multi-Perspective Study of Internet Performance during the COVID-19 Outbreak
For countries like France and Austria, we also find a slight
decrease in the delay values immediately after the lockdown
date. Similar to Italy and Spain, France was one of the countries with a high number of reported infections and a national
lockdown from the 17th of March. The collected data shows
a fluctuation in the RTT values following this date for both
the 5th and 95th percentile. However, we note that these
values remain at approximately the same levels throughout
March. In the case of Austria, we also record a small drop in
the RTT values; the 95th and 5th percentile drop with 1.8%
and 0.1%, respectively.
The Swedish pandemic response was completely different
than most European countries. Sweden did not impose a
lockdown and just issued a series of recommendations as a
response. Our data shows a low impact on the delay within
Sweden. The delay has remained stable throughout both
March and April.
Argentina imposed lockdown measures similar to the ones
imposed in Italy and Spain on the 19th of March. Initially
planned until the end of March, this period was later extended to the third week of April [2]. We observe as with
other countries diurnal pattern in the 95th percentile following the lockdown date. Moreover, during the last days of
March and first half of April we notice a significant increase
in delay. We can thus conclude that the pandemic outbreak
had an impact on the delay within Argentina.
In the case of Ireland, United Kingdom and United States
we find an increase in the 95th percentile and decrease in the
5th percentile values. In Ireland, the government initiated
the lockdown period from the 12th of March along with
measures like closing universities and schools and shutting
down non-essential businesses from the 24th of March. Our
results indicate an increase of 30% in the 95th percentile
in the week following the lockdown date. Moreover, our
analysis shows signs of congestion during the same period
and the following weeks. United Kingdom and United States
imposed gradual measures to counter the outbreak. In the
UK, a stay-at-home recommendation was given as early as
the 16th of March, while a stricter requirement was issued
on the 23rd of March [6]. The response in US has varied
across states. States like California, Massachusetts, and New
York imposed a stay-at-home order from 19th and 20th of
March. A similar restriction was imposed already on the 17th
of March in the San Francisco Bay Area [35]. However, states
like Iowa or Wyoming did not impose such restrictions. For
both the United Kingdom and United States, we note during
the measurement period an increase in the 95th percentile
RTT values. At the same time, we observe signs of congestion
in the probe networks for both countries from around the
lockdown date. For both these countries we also observe an
increase in the 5th percentile during March on several days.

Figure 6: Aggregate outage duration (left) and outages
count (right) both after filtering.
Takeaways. Our analysis of the RTT values as seen from
the RIPE Atlas measurement platform indicates that pandemic outbreak appears to have an impact on the intracountry delay. While this effect varies between countries
and may be influenced by other underlying factors, we find
clear indications of periods of congestion following the lockdown dates across multiple countries. Hikes in delay varies
across countries which can be attributed to differences in the
underlying infrastructure and the fraction of telecommuting
population.

OUTAGES DURING THE OUTBREAK

In this section, we employ two different approaches to investigate whether the lockdown has led to an increase in
Internet outages. The first is based on passive measurements
from RIPE Atlas [4], a global measurement infrastructure
of over 10,000 probes that is operated by RIPE. The second
analyzes operators’ reports in the outages mailing list. 2

4.1

RIPE Atlas outages

We leverage DISCO, a tool that monitors the stability of RIPE
Atlas probes, to infer outages [36]. Every RIPE Atlas probe
maintains a reverse SSH connection to a set of servers called
controllers in the RIPE infrastructure. These sessions are
used for sending commands to the probes. If the controller
does not receive a keep alive from a probe for a minute,
it tears down the SSH connection and marks the probe as
unresponsive. DISCO identifies and correlates such events
to infer outages in an AS or a geography.
Comparing the outages in the first four months of 2020 to
those in 2019 shows an evident increase. 1227 prefixes from
110 ASes had an outage involving 1809 unique probes in 2020
compared to 61 prefixes from 31 ASes (105 unique probes)
in 2019. Most of the increase took place during March and
April. On average outages lasted shorter in 2020 than in 2019
- about 40 minutes compared to over three hours.
While we do not know why outages have generally increased in 2020, we suspect that it could be related to a few
ASes that had a disproportionately high number of outages.
To control for this, we filter the top 25% of prefixes in terms

Ahmed Elmokashfi, Alfred Arouna, Ioana Livadariu, Mah-Rukh Fida, Amund Kvalbein, Anas Al-Selwi, Thomas Dreibholz,
and Haakon Bryhni
of either disconnection duration or number of outages. Figure 6 shows the number of outages and their duration after
filtering. The increase in the number and severity of outages
in March and April 2020 is clearly visible even after this
filtering. The average outage duration drops to ten minutes
for 2020 and just over an hour for 2019 after filtering.
The affected prefixes come from 35 countries from all
continents. Iran dominates outages across the four months
accounting for 29% and 19% of the outages in the first two
months and the last two months, respectively. This is evident
since early January so it is not clear whether it is related to
the outbreak.
European countries are over-represented in March and
April. The fraction of outages that involves a European country has risen from 38% in January-February to 51% in MarchApril. In the first two months of 2020, 46% of outages in
Europe took place during typical maintenance hours. This
fraction dropped to 40% in March-April. Hence, the increase
in outages during the outbreak can be blamed on a marked
increase in both non-maintenance related as well as maintenance related faults.
Although a detailed root cause analysis of the inferred
outages is outside the scope of this work, we manually investigate some of the outages in Europe that took place outside
typical maintenance hours. We particularly flag two outages
that affected home users and lasted for a relatively long period and thus may have had impact on people working from
home. The first affected Virgin Media (AS 5089) in the afternoon of April 27th and lasted for about 6 hours. During
these hours RIPE probes had intermittent connectivity, experiencing a total of 7 disconnects each lasting between 10
and 15 minutes. At its height, 94 of the 97 RIPE probes in the
affected AS were disconnected. This outage was reported by
various media outlets due to its significant impact and was
attributed to a fault in Virgin Media’s core network. 3 The
second outage affected an Austrian cable provider, Kabelplus,
in the morning of April 1st and lasted for about 20 minutes.
During this outage 7 of 12 probes in Kabelplus’s network,
which come from two different ASes 8339 and 8559, were
disconnected.

Table 3: The number of outage reports

Table 3 shows the number of outages that were reported
in different months. Although the numbers are small, we still
observe a clear increase in the number of outages reported
in March and April 2020.
Besides the increase in outages, what is also interesting
is the type of outages. The second half of March involved
a few reports of increased packet loss and delays between
several US providers. Such failures were probably caused by
congestion or lack of spare capacity following a failure of a
primary conduit. Youtube and Google services degraded for
about half an hour on March 26th. Google later published a
blog post indicating that its backbone network is designed
for absorbing the increase in traffic due to the covid-19 crisis. 4 The reporting of increases in packet loss and delay
continued in April. There were also reports related to collaborative and video conferencing platforms. On April 21st,
several major tier-1 providers experienced packet loss in the
US West Coast. These include AT&T, Level-3/Century Link,
Hurricane Electric, Telia, Cox and Comcast. The root cause
turned out to be the failure of multiple fiber links, which was
exacerbated by a lack of spare capacity due to the increasing
traffic demand. This type of failure is concerning, since it
illustrates the potential risk for cascading failures as traffic
demand increases.
Takeaways. The number of network outages has increased
during the lockdown period. The root causes include maintenance, congestion and lack of network capacity upon the
loss of a primary link. Although most outages were short,
some outages lasted hours and had likely impacted remote
workers.

Outages mailing list

We browsed the reports that were posted to the outages mailing list in the months of January to April in both 2019 and
2020. We then singled out all reports that are related to Internet outages (i.e. we left out voice), which were corroborated
by postings from several individuals or were confirmed by
the affected service providers. Note that the outages mailing
list is often used for reporting planned maintenance and

IMPACT ON DNS

Having investigated the performance of control and data
planes and the stability of the Internet during the lockdown
period, we move next to examine the impact on applications.
In this section, we compare the performance of accessing
DNS root servers.

Figure 7: Root DNS response time over IPv4 from January to April 2019 and 2020.

Figure 8: Root DNS traceroute minimum rtt from January to April 2019 and 2020.

5.1

Takeaways. The performance of DNS root servers has
been consistent during the lookdown period regardless of
the IP protocol version or the transport protocol in use.

Dataset

We leverage data collected by the RIPE NCC DNS monitoring
service (DNSMON)[8]. DNSMON measures the performance
of DNS from a set of RIPE Atlas anchors to all root DNS
servers since 2001. The set of anchors coverage is geographically large as possible and each anchor runs the same set
of measurements towards the same targets and periodically
reports the results back to the RIPE Atlas infrastructure. This
involves both DNS lookup and traceroutes to all root servers
over both IPv4 and IPv6 and using both TCP and UDP. We
focus on data that covers the two periods (January-April)
2019 and 2020.

5.2

CASE STUDY: VIDEO CONFERENCING

Continuing on evaluating the impact on application, we
study next how the lockdown has impacted a European
video conference network provider with global presence.
The video network customers fall in two categories, 1) enterprise video conferencing customers and video conferencing service providers hosting their video infrastructure and
2) subscribers to the recording and streaming service used
by enterprise customers, education, and health institutions.
Both applications are covered in the recorded data.

DNS performance

Figure 7 shows that the root DNS response time over IPv4 has
been relatively stable since 2019. we record a slight increase,
about a few milliseconds, in the median response time in
April 2020. The shape of the distribution, however remains
similar to the previous months. Lookups over IPv6 are also
stable albeit faster with a median response time below 20
milliseconds. Moura et al. have reported similar results when
measuring the performance of .nl TLD [28].
Similarly Figure 8 shows no changes in traceroute minimum RTT to Root DNS server during the lockdown period.
Interestingly, the 75th percentile IPv4 RTT has decreased
in April to match that of IPv6. The consistent minimum
traceroute RTTs confirm the DNS lookup results above.
The performance stability of Root DNS servers is a proof
of the resiliency and scalability of this critical component
of the Internet. The use of anycast combined with caching
on resolvers side means that traffic to Root DNS servers is
relatively lower than traffic to popular open resolvers (like
Google Public DNS, Quad9, Cloudfare, etc.). Therefore, it
could be also interesting to take a look at open resolver
performance during the lockdown.

6.1

Dataset

We collect our measurments from a global video conference
network provider operating a QoS managed network built of
dedicated links between 11 PoPs in Europe, North America
and Asia Pacific (APAC). The network provides QoS managed
last mile connections from their PoPs via approximately 25
commercial IP transit providers and presence at 10 Internet
Exchange points with more than 1500 BGP peering connections. Each PoP hosts network equipment and compute
capacity providing a private cloud used by their customers
to host video conferencing technology from Pexip, Cisco and
other video infrastructure providers. We collect flow data
using Netflow from the network operator’s PoPs in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Oslo, London in Europe, Asburn, San Jose
and Toronto in North America, and Sydney, Tokyo, Hong
Kong and Singapore in APAC. We focus on two measurement periods. Before the lockdown, from the 1st to the 13th
of February. After the lockdown, from the 15th of March
to the 30th of April. Besides, the Netflow dataset, we also
analyze the underlying data that the video provider is using
for accounting purposes. This includes traffic volumes per

and Haakon Bryhni

video network.

customer that is aggregated every 30 minutes and spans the
period from November 2019 to May 2020. The Netflow measurements give an insight into traffic flows at the IP level,
while the billing data gives an idea about traffic volumes per
customer.

6.2

Impact on traffic volumes

Working from home and attending school during the pandemic have significantly affected usage of all types of video
conferencing users. This can be seen in the unusual growth in
video conferencing traffic of the network provider in Figure 9,
increasing the amount of combined traffic for all interfaces
from a steady average of 1 Tbit/s input and output traffic
per day before the pandemic to almost 20 Tbit/s during the
pandemic with a rapid increase from mid-March when the
lock-down started in several countries where the service
provider operates. Note that this dataset count traffic both
on customer interfaces and on transit/internet exchange interfaces, so actual transported traffic grows from 0,5 Tbit/s
to approximately 10 Tbit/s. The traffic continues to grow
during the pandemic.
Another observation is that the amount of outbound traffic is growing faster during the pandemic. The trend was
visible before the pandemic as video conferencing upstream
video often use lower resolution and users sometimes turn
off their own video transmission when not talking, while
downstream video have higher quality and is usually on during the entire conference. During the pandemic, this trend
is stronger than we can explain with more people attending
video conferences. We found that the conferencing service
is increasingly combined with streaming sessions, where
large groups of users attend a single live or stored stream,
resulting in an accelerated growth in outbound traffic. Note
that the general video conferencing traffic also shows strong
growth.

6.3

Sources of growth

We have identified two sources of the increased traffic: streaming and video conferencing. Streaming has the highest impact, most notably for outbound traffic. Video recording
hours, which is used before creating a video stream, had an
increase of 208% from February to March 2020, and streaming
use increased 1100%. Figure 10 shows a dramatic example
of traffic growth for an American telehealth customer in
the video network providing remote medical consultations,
going from an average of 25 Mbit/s (95 percentile) regular
traffic from March 1 - March 13, 2020, increasing to 50 Mbit/s
from March 14 - March 20, 225 Mbit/s from March 21-26
and exceeding 450 Mbit/s in April 2020. Sustaining a growth
of up to 18x in the course of a few weeks represents extraordinary demands on network and compute facilities and
the service provider and suppliers had to work double shifts
to upgrade links, configure, ship and install equipment to
meet the demand. Similar growth has been reported by other
video infrastructure vendors [5].
A detailed study of the growth in flows compared to total
traffic shows that early during the pandemic, most video
service providers in the network reduced video resolution
from high definition (HD) to standard definition (SD). This
method reduced the growth in traffic but the number of
flows increased with the growing demand. For example, we
find that a video infrastructure customer in the dataset experienced 400% growth in the number of video flows from
February to March, while traffic grew only 50% in the same
period which ensured the service provider had sufficient
network and compute capacity to cope with the demand.
We confirmed the reduction in resolution with the customer.
The provider has also confirmed that many video service
providers did reduce video conferencing resolution, which
indicates that the real traffic growth could have been even
higher.
Takeaways. Our analysis shows that video conferencing
traffic is growing rapidly during the pandemic, and the use of
streaming services dominate the outbound traffic which can
be explained with the use of the infrastructure for education

A Multi-Perspective Study of Internet Performance during the COVID-19 Outbreak
(several universities use the streaming platform), one-tomany conferences and streaming events during lockdown.
Reduction from HD to SD resolution by many providers
has slowed down the traffic growth, but increased volume
can still be seen from the number of netflows per customer.
The highest traffic growth for an individual customer is 18x
during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic.

CASE STUDY: MOBILE NETWORK
DATA TRAFFIC

We leverage a country-wide deployment of stationary probes
in a western country to measure mobile data uplink and
downlink speeds. Each probe is a single-board computer
that connects to one or more mobile networks, via miniPCI
modems that support up to LTE CAT-6, using commercial
subscriptions. To measure speed, we use a command line
client for testing Internet speed using Ookla’s speedtest.net.
The test is essentially based on downloading and uploading
files of an increasing size from and to Ookla’s servers and
used that to estimate available bandwidth. The test runs
three times a day at 2:00 am, 2:00 pm and 7:00 pm local time
to capture different traffic profiles. The probes connect via
different frequency bands, depending on available coverage.
These include 800 MHz, 900MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz and
2600 MHz.
We collect speed measurements for two different mobile
networks Op1 and Op2 from 102 probes in the months of
February and April 2020. These two periods represent the
situation before and during pandemic-related restrictions in
the country. The 102 measurement nodes are located in 40
different municipalities.
Both operators have reported an increase in mobile data
traffic of up to 25% following the restrictions. Figure 11 shows
that with the increased load, an overall drop of 8.7% and 13.4%
occurred in the download speeds for Op1 and Op2 , respectively in the during period. The drop in upload speed is more
limited, with 2.9% and 2.1% for the two operators. Moreover,
we observed comparatively more drop on weekdays. Figure 12 shows that on weekend the median drop in speed for
Op1 is 7.7% and for Op2 it is 8.7%. However for weekdays the
observed median download speed goes down by 9.5% and
15.57% for the two operators, respectively.
Figure 13 shows the change in download and upload speed
split on the frequency bands that are mostly used for LTE
traffic by Op1 and Op2 . The figure shows how both download and upload speeds are affected differently in different
frequency bands. Both operators experience an increase in
upload and download speeds for connections in the 800 MHz
band. For the 1800 MHz band the results are mixed, while
both operators experience a significant decrease in speeds
in the 2600 MHz band.

Figure 11: Drop in speed with increased load on the
networks.

Figure 12: Download speed during weekends and
weekdays.

Figure 13: Download and upload speeds before and
during the lockdown period with probes operating at
different frequencies.
Mobile operators generally use higher LTE bands (2100
MHz and 2600 MHz) to provide coverage in densely populated areas where people live and work. Lower bands (subGHz) have better propagation characteristics and are typically used to provide coverage along roads and in more
remote areas. We believe the results in Figure 13 can be
directly explained by the changes in movement patterns resulting from the pandemic-related restrictions, with people
generally staying at home and working from home offices.

Ahmed Elmokashfi, Alfred Arouna, Ioana Livadariu, Mah-Rukh Fida, Amund Kvalbein, Anas Al-Selwi, Thomas Dreibholz,
and Haakon Bryhni
These lead to increased mobile data traffic in areas where
people live, and less traffic where people move.
To further understand reasons behind the observed variations in speed, we look at results on the granularity of probes
locations. Figure 14 shows the change in download speed for
each connection, when comparing the periods before and
during lockdown. We observe that 59% of connections in
Op1 and 66% of connections in Op2 experience a reduction in
download speeds. The reduction is 50% or higher for 18% and
15% of the total connections, of Op1 and Op2 respectively.
The remaining connections see an increase in download
speeds, which are more than 100% for some connections.

Figure 14: Change in the download speed, observed, in
the during period at different probes.
Figure 15 shows how the changes in download speeds
correlate with the population density of the area where the
measurement is taken. Measurement probes that see an increase in download speeds are mostly situated in areas with
lower population density, while those that see a drop in
speed are located in more densely populated areas. The median population density in 1 𝑘𝑚 2 squares where probes see
increased download speeds is 462 and 414, while it is 1367
and 1363 in areas where download speeds drop, for Op1 and
Op2 respectively. These observations show how the mobile
networks struggle to cope with the increased traffic in residential areas during the lockdown, while the changes in
movement patterns give plenty of capacity in other areas.
Takeaways. The lockdown has an evident impact on the
performance of the measured mobile networks. In the worst
case, some probes achieved only half of the speed that was
achievable before the lockdown.

DISCUSSION

We have provided a multi-prospective account of Internet
performance during the first lockdown period. In the following, we discuss our findings, their implications and. limitations
The Internet during the lockdown. The impact of the
lockdown period on the Internet is visible on various performance metrics. Working and schooling from home have lead

Figure 15: Population density at locations with increase and drop in the download speed.

to a dramatic increase in video conferencing. Performance
aspects of access network, both fixed and mobile, has noticeably degraded during the lockdown. While we have not
analyzed the general mix of traffic during the epidemic, the
case study of the global video providers shows a significant
growth in both video streaming and conferencing services
around the world.
The data plane measurements in Sec 3.3 show that , in
countries across the world, both low and high percentile
delays have increased in the lockdown months. This indicates
the presence of persistent congestion and higher peak traffic
volumes. The reduction in download speeds over mobile
networks hints that mobile networks are also running close
to their capacity during the lockdown. We also measure
performance improvements in areas with less population as
well as over frequencies that are deployed to support daily
commuters. Besides the degraded data plane performance,
outages have also increased.
Despite performance degradation due to the massive increase in traffic volumes, the core of the Internet architecture
including BGP routing and DNS have been fairly stable. In
fact, BGP dynamics have decreased during the lockdown.
Overall, the Internet seems to have managed to absorb
changes in traffic pattern and volumes reasonably well. While
a more detailed analysis is needed in order to fully understand this, we see signs of clever network management, adaptive traffic strategies and abundance of spare capacity.
Opportunities. The lockdown period has pushed the Internet to a new operating point, which can help answering
several questions about the Internet architecture. Differences
in data plane performance across countries could give a window into evaluating and comparing the state of Internet
infrastructure in different parts of the world. The outages
that took place during the pandemic deserve further attention, since they can help revealing structural weaknesses and
vulnerabilities. For example, the US west coast outage that is
briefly described in Sec 4.2 hints at presence of dependencies
between operators that are only visible at times of extreme

A Multi-Perspective Study of Internet Performance during the COVID-19 Outbreak
overload. The decrease in BGP dynamics can help improving our understanding of the composition of BGP activity
which can lead to better anomaly detection algorithms and
ultimately a better interdomain routing. Finally, the Internet
performance measurements can be used as a proxy to inform
efforts that aim to understand the impact of lockdown on
work and education in different countries.
Limitations and open questions. This paper has presented
several key findings about the first lockdown period, but has
also left many questions open. These questions warrant a
further investigation. An interesting aspect of the data plane
analysis is performance of inter-country routes. This is particularly interesting in markets with tight integration like
Europe. We have chosen to focus on intra-country latency
because we believe that most home office and schooling traffic remain within each country borders. An in-depth analysis
of outages, using active and passive approaches (e.g. [32, 34]),
could shed more light on root causes and dependencies between network providers.

RELATED WORK

The academic and operators community has been following
closely the possible effect of the pandemic on the Internet
performance. We further summarize and contrast with our
work the main reports related to the pandemic.
Several studies that characterize the data plane have been
published in the last few months. Notably, Candela et al. [15]
used data collected through the RIPE Atlas measurement
platform to study the impact of the pandemic on latency and
packet loss for Italy and report significant increase in both
metrics. In the COVID-19 delay-based short study [20] published on RIPE Labs, the authors rely on data collected from
the same platform to study change in RTT from major ISPs
in Europe to the Google network (AS15169), two large IXPs
(AMS-IX and DE-CIX), and the other network(s) these major
networks are most dependent on according to the AS hegemony. The study reports congestion signs as seen in RTT
values collected from probes in the Telecom Italia network
towards AMS-IX. We also rely on RIPE data for assessing the
data plane performance. Our analysis, however, covers countries that from all continents, and focuses on intra-country
delay. We find evidence of congestion periods in multiple
countries during the lockdown periods. Feldmann et al. [19]
investigated, using data from a couple ISPs and three IXPs,
changes in traffic volumes and patterns during the first wave
of the pandemic. They measured a 15-20% increase in traffic
and identified changes in traffic pattern, but also concluded
that the Internet has largely coped with the lockdown. A
paper from Facebook has pointed to similar conclusions from
the prospective of Facebook’s edge network [12]. It also to
variations in performance showing that the less developed

parts of the world suffered more performance degradation.
Liu et al. [24] looked into the impact of the lockdown period on the Internet performance in the US. Their results
highlighted increasing in traffic volumes, heterogeneous performance and the ISPs rush to upgrade and augment their
connectivity. Using data from a mobile operator in the UK,
Lutu et al. [25] investigated changes in mobility and traffic
patterns. They noted a drop in data traffic and an uptick in
voice traffic. Along the same lines, Rajiullah et al. used end
to end measurements from the MONROE platform to look
at the performance of nine mobile operators in Europe [33].
Despite a short term degradation in performance, these operators seem to have coped well with the lockdown traffic.
The video conferencing industry has reported high traffic
growth. StarLeaf provided key observations before and during the pandemic in their trend report [5] that comprises traffic report for their operation in France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. The report shows
that sharp increases in video usage for all nations can be
traced to the date of lockdown, or instructions to start working from home. Cloudflare [21] reported an 1.5x performance
increase in Internet traffic. Another study [21] observed that
when people pause in their daily activities, the Internet goes
quiet and show this with examples from the event #ClapForNHS in UK and Ramadan in the Muslim world.
Several studies focus on changes in application usage during the pandemic. A study reported the impact of COVID-19
outbreak on E-learning for 16K students per day in 600 virtual classes in the Politecnico di Torino campus network [38]
after the school closed. The authors testify how the Internet
has proved robust to successfully cope with challenges while
maintaining the university operations. ThousandEyes and
App Annie [13] report usage increase in gaming, VPN, and
video while social apps show a reduced trend.
Two large Internet Exchange Points, i.e., Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX) and Deutscher Commercial Internet
Exchange (DE-CIX), reported general increase with exception of the CDN operator Akamai [26] which reported that
US networks has not seen the same dramatic increase in
Internet traffic as in Europe. AMS-IX reported 17% general
increase related to the COVID-19 crisis at the end of March
2020 [9], while DE-CIX reported 10% general increase, 50%
increase in video-conferencing traffic (Skype, WebEx, Teams)
and 25% increase in online and cloud gaming and in traffic
from the use of social media platforms [16]. Ookla speedtest
is providing updated statistics on fixed and mobile network
performance which is very useful to study individual performance statistics per country [31].
We complement and improve on previous work by presenting a comprehensive multi-perspective account of Internet
performance during lockdown. We examine the performance
