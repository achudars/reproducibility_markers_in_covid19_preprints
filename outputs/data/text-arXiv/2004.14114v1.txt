Abstract
Tremendous effort has been given to the development of diagnostic tests, preventive vaccines, and
therapeutic medicines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Much of this development has been based on the reference genome
collected on January 5, 2020. Based on the genotyping of 6156 genome samples collected up to April 24,
2020, we report that SARS-CoV-2 has had 4459 alarmingly mutations which can be clustered into five subtypes. We introduce mutation ratio and mutation h-index to characterize the protein conservativeness and
unveil that SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein, main protease, and endoribonuclease protein are relatively conservative, while SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, spike protein, and papain-like protease are relatively
non-conservative. In particular, the nucleocapsid protein has more than half its genes changed in the past
few months, signaling devastating impacts on the ongoing development of COVID-19 diagnosis, vaccines,
and drugs.

Key words: genotyping, genome clustering, mutation h-index, mutation ratio.

Introduction

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses crucial threats to the public health and the world economy since
it was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1]. As of April 24, 2020, more than 2.6 million cases
of COVID-19 have been reported in 185 countries and territories, resulting in more than 184,000 deaths [2].
Tragically, there is no sign of slowing down nor relief at this monument partially due to the fact there is no
specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and effective vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-strand RNA virus and belongs to the beta coronavirus genus. The genomic
information underpins the development of antiviral medical interventions, preventative vaccines, and viral diagnostic tests. The first SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 5, 2020 [3]. It has a genome
size of 29.99 kb, which encodes for multiple non-structural and structural proteins. The leader sequence
and ORF1ab encode non-structural proteins for RNA replication and transcription. Among various nonstructural proteins, viral papain-like (PL) proteinase, main protease (or 3CL protease), RNA polymerase,
and endoribo-nuclease are common targets in antiviral drug discovery. However, it typically takes more
than ten years to put an average drug to the market. The downstream regions of the genome encode structural proteins including spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid
(N) protein. Notably, S-protein uses one of two subunits to bind directly to the host receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), enabling the virus entry into host cells [4]. The nucleocapsid (N) protein, one
of the most abundant viral proteins, can bind to the RNA genome and is involved in replication processes,
assembly, the host cellular response during viral infection [5]. The E protein is a small integral membrane
protein, a virulence factor, regulating cell stress response and apoptosis, and promoting inflammation [6].
The structural proteins, especially, the Spike protein and the N protein, are the candidate antigens for vaccine development. Developing safe and effective vaccines is urgently needed to prevent the spread of
SARS-CoV-2. However, it typically takes over one year to design and test a new vaccine. Furthermore,
the SARS-CoV-2 genome undergoes rapid mutations partially stimulated as a response to the challenging
immunological environments arising from the COVOD-19 patients of different races, ages, and medical
conditions. SARS-CoV-2 exists as heterogeneous and dynamic populations because of their error-prone
replication [7].
The vaccine developed at one time may not be effective for mitigating the infection by new mutated
virus isolates. An alarming fact is that many of these mutations may devastate the on-going effort in the
development of effective medicines, preventive vaccines, and diagnostic tests. Accurate identification of
the antigens and their mutations represents the most important roadblock in developing effective vaccines
against COVID-19. For example, different vaccines are needed for different geographic locations due to predominant mutations in the corresponding regions. In COVID-19 diagnosis, the diagnosis kits are designed
using two major methods, i.e., specific serological tests and molecular tests. Serological tests are to detect
specific COVID-19 proteins. Molecular diagnoses test specific COVID-19 pathogenic genes, which usually
rely on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Because of the fast mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome,
genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 may optimize the PCR primer design to detect SARS-CoV safely and
reduce the risk of false-negatives caused by genome sequence variations. In addition, the genotyping analysis may also reveal those regions that are highly conserved with very few mutations, which can be selected
as a target sequence for reliable drug therapy and general diagnosis.
The evolution pattern through the highly frequent mutations of SARS-CoV-2 can be observable on short
time scales. In the early infection period (i.e., February 2020), the SARS-CoV-2 variants were clustered as S
and L types [8]. Recent genotyping analysis reveals a large number of mutations in various essential genes
encoding the S protein, the N protein, and RNA polymerase in the SARS-CoV-2 population [9]. Monitoring
the evolutionary patterns and spread dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is of grace importance for COVID-19 control

2

and prevention.
Although mutations occur randomly, most preserved mutations can be regarded as virus responds to
the host immune system surveillance. As a result, the faster and the wider the SARS-CoV-2 spread is,
the more frequent and diverse the mutations will be. The tracking and analysis of COVID-19 dynamics,
transmission, and spread is of paramount importance for winning the on-going battle against COVID-19.
Genetic identification and characterization of the geographic distribution, intercontinental evolution, and
global trends of SARS-CoV-2 is the most efficient approach for studying COVID-19 genomic epidemiology
and offer the molecular foundation for region-specific SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design, drug discovery, and
diagnostic development [10]. For example, different vaccines for the shell can be designed according to
predominant mutations.
This work provides the most comprehensive genotyping to reveal the transmission trajectory and spread
dynamics of COVID-19 to date. Based on genotyping 6156 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the world as of
April 24, 2020, we trace the COVID-19 transmission pathways and analyze the distribution of the subtypes
of SARS-CoV-2 across the world. We use K-means methods to cluster SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which provides the updated molecular information for the region-specific design of vaccines, drugs, and diagnoses.
Our clustering results show that globally, there are at least five distinct subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
While, in the U.S., there are at least three significant SARS-CoV-2 genotypes. We introduce mutation hindex and mutation ratio to characterize conservative and non-conservative proteins and genes. We unveil
the unexpected non-conservative genes and proteins, rendering an alarming warning for the current development of diagnostic tests, preventive vaccines, and therapeutic medicines.

Results and discussion
COVID-19 evolution and clustering

Tracking the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways and analyzing the spread dynamics are critical to the
study of genomic epidemiology. Temporospatially clustering the genotypes of SARS-CoV-2 in transmission
provides insights into diagnostic testing and vaccine development in disease control. In this work, we
retrieve and genotype 6156 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from word as of April 24, 2020. There are 4459 single
mutations in 6156 SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Based on these mutations, we classify and track the geographical
distributions of 6156 genoytype isolates by K-means clustering. The SARS-CoV-2 genotypes, represented
as SNP variants, are clustered as five groups in the world Table 2. The genotypes in the U.S. are clustered
as three groups Table 2. The optimal clustering groups are established using the Elbow method in the
K-means clustering algorithm (see Supporting Material).

The detailed distribution of the SNP variants from the world for each cluster is provided in the Supporting Material. The SNP variant clusters from 11 countries that have the highest number of cases recorded in
are listed in Table 2. The countries are United States (US), Canada (CA), Australia (AU), United Kingdom
(UK), Germany (DE), France (FR), Italy (IT), Ukraine (UA), China (CN), Japan (JP), and Korean (KR). The
3

numbers of SNP variants in each cluster are shown on the world map in Figure 1. The geographic distribution of the SNP variant clusters reflects the approximate transmission pathways and spread dynamics
across the world. Several findings can be read from the Table 2:
1. Two early subtypes of SASR-CoV-2 (cluster I and II) are epidemic in the Asian countries (CN, JP, KR).
2. The subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 in Cluster III is not spreading in the European countries (UK, DE, FR,
IT).
3. All of the subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 in five different clusters can be found in the US, AU, and Canada.
4. The dominant subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the United States belong to all the five clusters.
The cluster analysis reveals that the Asian countries only have two dominant subtype clusters, cluster I
[8782C>T, 28144T>C], and cluster II [14408C>T]. Cluster I was detected in the early period of COVID19 infection in China and Asian countries. The subtype of SNP mutation in Spike protein, 23403A>G, is
prevalent in the clusters III, IV, and V of European countries. This subtype of Spike protein mutation may
confer the high spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the European countries.

Moreover, we analyze the statistic of SNP variants located in different states of the United States. In
Table 3, we list the number of cases in three different clusters with respects to the west coast states (Washington (WA), California (CA), Alaska (AK), and Oregon (OR)), the east coast cities and states ( New York
(NY), Pennsylvania (PA), Florida (FL), Massachusetts (MA), Maryland (MD), Virginia (VA)), Minnesota
(MN), Georgia (GA), Utah (UT), Connecticut (CT), Arizona (AZ), and Idaho (ID). Notably, several findings
on the genotypes of clusters in the US are as follows:
1. Cluster B is dominated by the west coast states, especially the state of Washington.
2. Cluster C is dominated by the east coast states, especially in the state of New York, and in the midwest
state of Wisconsin, and the Midwest state of Wisconsin.
3. The subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 in Cluster A are spread out through the United States.
Figure 2 is the scatter plot of the three distinct clusters in the US. The size of each circle represents the
number of SNP variants. The red circle represents Cluster C, which covers most of the states in the U.S. The
red circle is the SNP variants in Cluster C, which mainly spreads in Idaho (ID).
We note that Cluster C in the U.S. is derived from Cluster III in the world, with an additional mutation
at the leader sequence 241. The high spread in New York is consistent with the high transmission of SARSCoV-2 in the European countries, where the subtype in Cluster III is predominated.

Table 5 presents the statistics of single mutations on various SARS-CoV-2 proteins that occurred in the
recorded genomes between January 5, 2020, and April 24, 2020. The papain-like protease has the highest
number of mutations of 599 while the envelope protein has the lowest number of mutations of 13. Since
the sizes of proteins vary dramatically from 1945 for the papain-like protease to 75 for the envelope protein,
it is useful to consider the mutation ratio, i.e., the number of mutations per residue. In this category, the
envelope protein still has the lowest score of 0.17, whereas the nucleocapsid protein has the highest score
of 0.56, i.e, 235 mutations on its 419 residues. Note that 3CL protease has the second-lowest mutation ratio
of 0.22, indicating its conservative nature. Another relatively conservative protein judged by the mutations
ratio is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It has 223 mutations over its 932 residues.
Counting the number of single mutations and mutation ratio does not reflect the fact some mutations
occur numerous times over genome samples while other mutations may happen only on a few genome
samples. To account for the frequency effect of mutations, we introduce a mutation h-index to measure
both the number of mutations and the frequency of mutations of a given protein or genetic section. It is
defined as the maximum value of h such that the given protein genetic section has h single mutations that
have each occurred at least h times. It is very interesting to note from Table 5 that the mutation h-index
correlates very well with the number of mutations per residue. Specifically, nucleocapsid protein has both
the highest number of mutations per residues of 0.56 and the highest h-index of 27, suggesting that it is the
most non-conservative protein in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. In contrast, the envelope protein has the lowest
number of mutations per residues of 0.17 and the lowest h-index of 5, indicating its relatively conservative
nature. By combining the number of mutations per residue and the mutation h-index, we report that the
three most conservative SARS-CoV-2 proteins are 1) the envelope protein, 2) the main protease, and 3) the
endoribonuclease. It is found that the most non-conservative SARS-CoV-2 proteins are 1) the nucleocapsid
protein, 2) the spike protein and 3) the papain-like protease.
2.2.2

Diagnosis

Real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) is routinely used in the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV2 for diagnostic testing COVID-19 [11, 12]. The primers used in the rRT-PCR are critical for the precise
diagnosis of COVID-19 and the discovery of new strains. The primer sequences are specially designed for
amplifying the conserved regions across the different existing strains for high specificity and sensitivity, and
also are subject to genotype changes as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus evolves. In diagnostic testing COVID19, many rRT-PCR primers are designed to detect for three perceived conservative SARS-CoV-2 regions:

8

(1) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene in ORF1ab region, (2) the E protein gene, and (3) the N
protein gene [11]. Our genotyping statistics given in Table 5 indicates that the nucleocapsid protein is the
worst choice.
Among four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the spike surface glycoprotein (S) of 1273 amino acid
residues, nucleocapsid protein (N) of 419 amino acid residues, membrane protein (M) of 222 amino acid
residues, envelope protein (E) of 75 amino acid residues, the S protein is the most divergent with 385 unique
mutations among the 6156 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The N protein has 235 unique mutations, the E protein
has 13 mutations. Considering the lengths of the proteins, all the four structural proteins undergo high
mutations. The RdRP gene, which is often used in diagnostic testing COVID-19, also has 223 mutations.
Therefore, all the three regions in routine rRT-PCR target, namely RdRP, the N protein gene, and the
E protein genes, have significant mutations. Precise and robust diagnosis tools must be re-established
according to the conserved regions and predominated mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes detailed in
the Supporting Material.
2.2.3

Vaccine development

Notably, SARS-CoV-2 has a unique furin cleavage site, where four amino acid residues (PRRA) are inserted
into the S1-S2 junction region 681-684 of the S protein [13]. The furin cleavage site is crucial for zoonotic
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [14]. This study reveals crucial mutations near the S1-S2 junction region in
the S protein, including 23403A>G-(D614G), 23422C>T-(V620V), 23575C>T-(C671C), 23586A>G-(Q674R),
23611G>A-(R683R), 23707C>T-(P715P), 23731C>T-(T723T), 23849T>C-(L763L), and 23929C>T-(Y788Y).
Moreover, these mutations of the S protein SARS-CoV-2 are located at the epitope region, corresponding to
the regions 469-882 and 599-620 in SARS-CoV) [15].
Additionally, many mutated amino acids are on the surface of the S protein as shown in Fig. 5. Unfortunately, the S protein is the second most non-conservative protein in the genome based on the number of
mutations per residue and mutation h-index. In fact, about half of the receptor-binding domain residues of
the S proteins have had mutations in the past few months as shown in Fig. 6. Because the surface accessibility of epitope is also important for the interaction of antibody and antigen, these mutations are critical
for the antigenicity of the S protein.
The convalescent COVID-19 patients show a neutralizing antibody response after infection, which are
directed against the S protein or the N protein [16]. The neutralizing antibody responses against SARSCoV-2 could give some defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection and thus, having implications for preventing
SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. The divergence of spike proteins, the non-conserved regions of the spike proteins
might contribute to the antigenicity. The high frequent mutations identified in the S protein and the N
proteins must be considered when designing a vaccine.
2.2.4

Drug discovery

Unfortunately, there is no specific effective drug for SARS-CoV-2 at this point. Much of the drug discovery
effort focuses on SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins. Among the major non-structural proteins of SARSCoV-2, the main protease of 306 amino acids has 68 mutations with 0.22 mutations per residue and the
mutation h-index of 9, RNA polymerase of 932 amino acids has 223 mutations with 0.24 mutations per
residue and the mutation h-index of 13, and papain-like protease of 1945 amino acids has 599 mutations
with 0.31 mutations per residue and the mutation h-index of 15. In fact, the main protease is the most
popular drug target because there are no similar known genes in the human genome, which implies SARSCoV-2 main protease inhibitors will be likely less toxic [17]. The present study suggests that the main

9

protease is the second most conservative protein. Therefore, it remains the most attractive target for drug
discovery.

Figure 5: Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations using 6VXX as a template [13].

2.2.5.1 Spike glycoprotein The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, or S protein, comprised of two subunits, S1 and S2, of very different properties [13], see Fig. 5. Among them, the S1 subunit, as shown in Fig.
5, contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) responsible for binding to the host cell receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The RBD is also the common binding domain for antibodies. The S2 subunit
offers the structural support of the S protein and mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes. After the fusion, the virus releases the viral genome into the host cell.
10

Figure 6: Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein receptor binding domain (RBD) mutation using 6m0j as a template. It is noted that
near half of residues in the RBD have undergone mutations in the few months.

The S1 RBD protein plays key parts in the induction of neutralizing-antibody and T-cell responses,
as well as protective immunity. However, S2 and extracellular domain (ECD) of spike protein and their
combination are commonly used in recombinant proteins in SARS-CoV-2 antibody development.
As shown in Table 5, the S protein is the most heterogeneous structural protein with a significant number
of mutations as shown in Figs. 5 and 6 and Table 6. The divergence of the spike protein, the non-conserved
regions of the spike protein might contribute to the antigenicity difference in SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We
found that most of the high frequent mutations of the S protein are located in the S1 subunit. Figure
6 indicates that near half of the amino acid residues have had mutations since January 5, 2020. One of
the important mutations at S1 is 23010 (V483A) within the RBD for ACE2 binding. The structural study
revealed that the amino acids 442-487 in the S1 subunit may impact viral binding to human ACE2 [18, 19].
The mutations identified in this study imply the change in ACE2 binding affinity and the transmissibility
of SARS-CoV-2 as well as negative impacts in preventive vaccine and diagnostic test development.

2.2.5.2 Main protease SARS-CoV-2 main protease, or 3CL protease, is essential for cleaving the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA [17]. It operates at multiple cleavage sites on the large polyprotein through the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins and plays a pivotal role in viral gene expression and replication. SARS-CoV-2 main protease is one of the most attractive targets for anti-CoV drug
design because its inhibition would block viral replication and it is unlikely to be toxic due to no known
similar human proteases. Another reason for the focused drug discovery efforts in developing SARS-CoV-2
main protease inhibitors is that this protein is relatively conservative as shown in Table 5.
Figure 7 illustrates the main protease mutation patterns. Figure 8 further highlights the inhibitor binding
domain (BD). Indeed, the main protease is relatively conservative compared to the spike protein. Table 7
lists top 11 mutations and their frequency in our dataset. It is interesting to see that many mutations, such
as Y239Y, N151N, R298R, L272L, and P132P, are degenerate ones. One possible explanation is that nondegenerate may be non-silent and likely cause unsurvivable disruption to the virus. Note that mutation
G15S mostly occurs in Cluster IV. Mutation Y239Y is restricted to Cluster I. Some other mutations, such as
R298R, G71S, and P132P, are specific to certain clusters. Nonetheless, some mutations at the BD shown in
Fig. 8 are worth noting. They can undermine the ongoing drug discovery effort.

Figure 9: Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease mutations using 6W9C as a template [20].

2.2.5.3 Papain-like protease SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLPro) is a cysteine cleavage protein
located within the non-structural protein 3 (NS3) section of the viral genome [20]. Like, the main protease,
PLPro activity is required to cleave the viral polyprotein into functional, mature subunits and, thereby,
13

contributes to the biogenesis of the virus replication. Additionally, PLpro possesses a deubiquitinating
activity. The SARS PLPro is also a major therapeutic and diagnostic target.
As shown in Table 5, the SARS PLPro is prone to mutations. Figure 9 shows that mutations are all over
the places in PLPro. Table 8 lists top ten mutations in PLPro. Five of these mutations are degenerate ones,
including one of the highest frequented mutations. Note that none one of the top mutations occurred in
Cluster I. On the contrast, Cluster II has many different mutations.

Figure 10: Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-polymerase mutations using 6M71 as a template [21].

2.2.5.4 RNA polymerase SARS RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is an enzyme that catalyzes
the synthesis of the SARS RNA strand complementary to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA template and thus essential
to the replication of SARS-CoV-2 RNA [21]. As one of the non-structure proteins, RdRPs located in the
early part of ORF1b section. Like most other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 RdRPs are considered to be highly
conserved to maintain viral functions and thus targeted in antiviral drug development as well as diagnostic
tests. On the other hand, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase lacks proofreading capability and thus its
mutations are deemed to happen as shown in Table 5.
Figure 10 illustrates the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP mutations since January 5, 2020. Surprisingly, there are

14

many mutations in SARS-CoV-2 RdRP. Table 9 describes the top ten mutations. As in other cases, five of
these mutations are degenerate ones. Cluster I has no nondegenerate mutations.

Figure 11: Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 Endoribo-nuclease protein mutations using 6VWW as a template [22].

2.2.5.5 Endoribo-nuclease Endoribo-nuclease (NendoU) protein is a nidoviral RNAuridylate-specific
enzyme that cleaves RNA [22]. It contains a C-terminal catalytic domain belonging to the EndoU family
RNA processing. The NendoU protein is presented among coronaviruses, arteriviruses, and toroviruses.
The many aspects of the detailed function and activity of SARS-CoV-2 NendoU protein are yet to be revealed.
Figure 11 depicts SARS-CoV-2 NendoU protein mutations. Like in most other SARS-CoV-2 proteins,
mutations have occurred over different parts. Table 5 shows that NendoU is relatively conservative. Table
10 lists the top twelve high-frequency mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 NendoU protein that occurred in the
past few months. Three of these mutations are degenerate ones. The frequencies of these mutations range
from 38 to 6. Note that Cluster I do not have any of these mutations.

Figure 12: Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein mutations using 5X29 as template [23].

2.2.5.6 Envelope protein The SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein is one of SARS-CoV’s four structural
proteins. As a transmembrane protein, it involves in ion channel activity, and thus facilitates viral assembly,
budding, envelope formation, pathogenesis, and release of the virus [23]. The E protein may not be essential
for viral replication but it is for pathogenesis.
Figure 12 illustrates E protein as a very small pentamer with a few mutations. Table 11 shows its top
thirteen mutations. Note that the first 7 mutations are degenerate ones. All other mutations have very low
frequencies. As shown in Table 5, the SARS-CoV-2 E protein is very conservative.

Figure 13: Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein mutations using 6VYO as a template [24].

2.2.5.7 Nucleocapsid protein SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is another structural protein. Its primary function is to encapsidate the viral genome. To do so, it is heavily phosphorylated (or charged) and
thereby, can bind with RNA. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 N protein confirms the viral genome to replicasetranscriptase complex (RTC) and plays a crucial role in viral genome encapsulation. Therefore, it may
function completely differently at different stages of the viral life cycle. SARS-CoV-2 N protein is considered to be one of the most conservative SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the literature and is a popular target for
diagnosis of vaccine development [11]. The present works shown in Table 5 indicates the SARS-CoV-2 N
protein is the worst target of any drug, vaccine, and diagnostic development.
Table 12 presents the top fourteen mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein since January 5, 2020. Note
that only three out of fourteen top mutations are degenerate ones, which is a significantly lower ratio than
that of other proteins. The frequency of 14th mutation is 67, which suggests there are many mutations
associated with these mediate-sized proteins. Most top mutations occurred to Clusters II and IV. Cluster V
17

has none of the top fourteen mutations.

2.2.5.8 Membrane protein SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein is another structural protein and plays a
central role in viral assembly and viral particle formation. It exists as a dimer in the virion and has certain
geometric shapes to enable certain membrane curvature and binding to nucleocapsid proteins. Similar to
other SARS-CoV proteins, M protein is also a popular target for viral diagnosis and vaccines.
Table 5 gives SARS-CoV-2 M protein the meddle ranking for its conservation. Table 13 details the top
eleven mutations in SARS-CoV-2 M protein occurred in the past few months. Seven of these mutations are
degenerate. Clusters I and V have relatively a few of these mutations.

Material and Methods
Data collection and pre-processing

On January 5, 2020, the complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was first released on GenBank (Access
number: NC 045512.2) by Zhang’s group at Fudan University [3]. Since then, there has been a rapid accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. In this work, 6156 complete genome sequences with high
coverage of SARS-CoV-2 strains from the infected individuals in the world are downloaded from the GISAID database [25] (https://www.gisaid.org/) as of April 24, 2020. All the records in GISAID without the
exact submission date will not take into considerations. To rearrange the 6156 complete genome sequences
according to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome, multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is carried out by using
Clustal Omega [26] with default parameters.

3.2

SNP genotyping

SNP genotyping measures the genetic variations between different members of a species. Establishing the
SNP genotyping method for the investigation of the genotype changes during the transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is of great importance. By analyzing the rearranged genome sequences, SNP profiles
which record all of theSNP positions in teams of the nucleotide changes and its corresponding positions can
be constructed. The SNP profiles of a given genome of a COVID-19 patient capture all the differences from a
complete reference genome sequence and can be considered as the genotype of the individual SARS-CoV-2.

18

3.3

Distance of SNP variants

The Jaccard distance measures dissimilarity between sample sets. The Jaccard distance of SNP variants is
widely employed in the phylogenetic analysis of human or bacterial genomes [9]. In this work, we utilize
the Jaccard distance to compare the difference between the SNP variant profiles of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
The Jaccard similarity coefficient, also known as the Jaccard index, is defined as the intersection size
divided by the union of two sets A, B [27]:
J(A, B) =

|A ∩ B|
|A ∩ B|
=
.
|A ∪ B|
|A| + |B| − |A ∩ B|

(1)

The Jaccard distance of two sets A, B is scored as the difference between one and the Jaccard similarity
coefficient and is a metric on the collection of all finite sets:
dJ (A, B) = 1 − J(A, B) =

|A ∪ B| − |A ∩ B|
.
|A ∪ B|

(2)

Therefore, the genetic distance of two genomes corresponds to the Jaccard distance of their SNP variants.
In principle, the Jaccard distance measure of SNP variants takes account of the ordering ofSNP positions,
i.e., transmission trajectory, when an appropriate reference sample is selected. However, one may fail to
identify the infection pathways from the mutual Jaccard distances of multiple samples. In this case, the
dates of the sample collections offer useful information. Additionally, clustering techniques, such as kmeans described below, enable us to characterize the spread of COVID-19 onto the communities.

3.4 K-means clustering
K-means clustering is one of the fundamental unsupervised algorithms in machine learning which aims at
partitioning a given data set X = {x1 , x2 , · · · , xn , · · · , xN }, xn ∈ Rd into k clusters {C1 , C2 , · · · , Ck }, k ≤ N
such that the specific clustering criteria are optimized. More specifically, the standard K-means clustering
algorithm starts to pick k points as cluster centers randomly and then allocates each data to its nearest
cluster. The cluster centers will be updated iteratively by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares
(WCSS) which is defined by:
k
X
X
kxi − µk k22 ,
(3)
i=1 xi ∈Ck

where µk = i ∈ Ck xi /nk is the mean of points located in the k-th cluster Ck and nk is the number of points
in Ck . Here, k · k2 denote the L2 distance.
The algorithm above only provides a way to obtain the optimal partition for a fixed number of clusters.
However, we are interested in finding the best number of clusters for the SNP variants. Therefore, the Elbow
method is applied. By varying the number of clusters k, a set of WCSS can be calculated in the K-means
clustering process, and then the plot of WCSS according to the number of clusters k can be carried out.
The location of the elbow in this plot will be considered as the optimal number of clusters. To be noticed,
the WCSS measures the variability of the points within each cluster which is influenced by the number
of points N . Therefore, as the number of total points of N increases, the value of WCSS becomes larger.
Additionally, the performance of k-means clustering depends on the selection of the specific distance.
In this work, we propose to implement K-means clustering with the Elbow method for analyzing the
optimal number of the subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 SNP variants. The Jaccard distance-based and Locationbased representations are considered as the input features for the K-means clustering method.

19

3.4.1

Jaccard distance-based representation

Suppose we have a total of N SNP variants concerning a reference genome in a SARS-CoV-2 sample. The
location of the mutation sites for each SNP variant will be saved in the set Si , i = 1, 2, · · · , N . The Jaccard
distance between two different sets (or samples) Si , Sj is denoted as dJ (Si , Sj ). Therefore, the N ×N Jaccard
distance-based representation will be:
DJ (i, j) = dJ (Si , Sj ).
(4)
3.4.2

Location-based representation

Suppose we have N SNP variants with respect to a reference genome in a SARS-CoV-2 sample. Among
them, M different mutation sites can be counted. For i-th SNP variant, Vi = [vi1 , vi2 , · · · , viM ], i = 1, 2, · · · , N
is a 1 × M vector which satisfies:
(
1, if mutation happens at location j
j
vi =
(5)
0, otherwise.
Therefore, an N × M location-based representation will be:
L(i, j) = vij
3.4.3

(6)

Principal component analysis (PCA)

Hundreds of complete genome sequences are deposit to the GISAID every day, which results in an evergrowing massive quantity of high dimensional data representations for the K-means clustering. For example, if the dataset of an organism involves 10,000 SNPs, the initial representation will be a 10,000dimensional vector for each sample, which can be computationally difficult for a simple K-means clustering algorithm. Therefore, a dimensionality reduction method is used to pre-process the data. The essential
idea of PCA-based K-means clustering is to invoke the PCA to obtain a reduced-dimensional representation of each sample before performing the K-means clustering. In practice, one can select a few lowest
dimensional principal components as the K-means input for each sample. In Ref. [28], the authors proved
that the principal components are the continuous solution of the cluster indicators in the K-means clustering method, which provides us a rigorous mathematical tool to embed our high-dimensional data into a
low-dimensional PCA subspace.

Conclusion

The rapid global transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has offered some of the most heterogeneous, diverse, and challenging mutagenic environments to stimulate dramatic genetic evolution and response from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This work provides the most
comprehensive genotyping of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and evolution up to date based on 6156 genome
samples and reveals five clusters of the COVID-19 genomes and associated mutations on eight different
SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We introduce mutation h-index and mutation ratio to qualify individual protein’s
degree of non-conservativeness. We unveil that SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein, main protease, and endoribonuclease protein are relatively the most conservative, whereas, SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, spike
protein, and papain-like protease are relatively the most non-conservative. We report an alarming fact that
all of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins have undergone intensive mutations since January 5, 2020, and some of

20

these mutations may seriously undermine ongoing efforts on COVID-19 diagnostic testing, vaccine development, and drug discovery.
