Different ways of calculating mortality ratios during epidemics have yielded very different results, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection duration-dependent SIR model to define individual- and
population-based estimates of dynamic mortality ratios. The key parameters that affect the dynamics of the different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the time individuals were
infected before confirmation of infection. We stress that none of these ratios are accurately represented by the often misinterpreted case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of deaths to date divided
by the total number of confirmed infected cases to date. Using data on the recent SARS-CoV-2
outbreaks, we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality ratios and highlight their differences. Informed by our modeling, we propose more systematic methods to determine mortality
ratios during epidemic outbreaks and discuss sensitivity to confounding effects and uncertainties in
the data.

INTRODUCTION

The mortality ratio is a key metric describing the severity of a viral disease [1]. These metrics typically change in
time before converging to a constant value and can be defined in a number of ways. One commonly used metric is
the (confirmed) case fatality ratio (CFR or cCFR), the total number of deaths to date, D(t), divided by the total
number of all confirmed cases to date N (t) [1–4]. Infection fatality ratios (IFR), the number of deaths to date divided
by the number of all infecteds, have also been used [5–7] although the IFR requires an estimate of the number of
unconfirmed infecteds.
Both the CFR and IFR have been widely estimated from aggregated population data from past outbreaks [2] as well
as from those of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks [1, 5, 7–11]. We show examples of CFR curves in Fig. 1 and in the
Supplemental Information (SI). As of March 31, 2020, the global CFR(t) = D(t)/N (t) = 42, 158/858, 892 ≈ 4.9% [12],
while CFRs in individual regions vary significantly. Clearly, this estimate would correspond to the actual mortality
ratio if (i) all infecteds were tested and (ii) all remaining unresolved individuals recover. However, some infected
patients will die, increasing the estimated mortality ratio over time. Despite the underestimation of this type of
population-based measurement, it is still commonly being used by various health officials and is often inconsistently
defined as deaths/(deaths + recovereds) even though this difference has been clearly distinguished [13].
During the severe 2003 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, the World Health Organization
(WHO) also used the aforementioned estimate to obtain a CFR of 4.5% while the final values, after resolution of
infecteds, approached 17.0% [15, 16]. For the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, analyses by WHO and many others
still use the CFR = D(t)/N (t) metric [7, 9, 11], (see Table I), or time-shifted variants [1, 6]. Since true mortality
rates are critical for assessing the risks associated with epidemic outbreaks, typical underestimations by CFRs may
lead to insufficient countermeasures and a more severe epidemic [17, 18].
An unambiguous definition of mortality ratio is the probability that a single, newly infected individual will eventually
die of the disease. If there are sufficient individual-level or cohort data, these probabilities can be further stratified
according to patient age, gender, health condition, etc. [1, 19]. This intrinsic mortality ratio, or probability of death,
should be an intrinsic property of the virus and the infected individual, depending on age, health, access to health
care, etc., and ought not directly depend on the population-level dynamics of infected and recovered individuals.
Thus, it can be framed as a survival probability of a single infected individual. Whether this individual infects others
does not directly affect his probability of eventually dying [20].
In the Results, we derive a model describing the probability M1 (t) that an infected individual dies or recovers
before time t. Importantly, these models incorporate the duration of infection (including an incubation period)
before a patient tests positive at time t = 0. However, the CFR and other mortality measures are typically reported
based on population data. Do these population-based measures, including CFR, provide reasonable measures of
the probability of death of an individual? Also in the Results, we describe how mortality ratios are defined within
population-level models, specifically, a disease duration-structured SIR model. We will show that population-based
estimates are typically not a meaningful measure of mortality, but that under simplifying assumptions, the mortality
ratio Mp (t) = D(t)/(D(t) + R(t)), where R(t) is the number of recovereds up to time t, is more closely related to the
true probability of death M1 (t) [13]. The simplest population-level mortality ratio is currently (as of March 31, 2020)

are based on Ref. [14].

We use the same estimates for the rate parameters in our individual and population models to compute the different
mortality ratios. Note that in general, both the individual mortality probability M1 (t) and the population-based
estimates Mp (t) depend on the time of measurement t. By critically analyzing these estimates, the CFR, and a
“delayed” case fatality ratio CFRd , we illustrate and interpret the differences among these measures and discuss how
changes or uncertainty in the data affect them. In the Discussion, we summarize our results and identify a correction
factor to transform population-level mortality estimates into individual mortality probabilities.

RESULTS
Intrinsic individual mortality rate

Consider an individual that, at the time of positive testing (t = 0), had been infected for a duration τ1 . A “survival”
probability density can be defined such that P (τ, t|τ1 )dτ is the probability that the patient is still alive and infected
(not recovered) at time t > 0 and has been infected for a duration between τ and τ + dτ . Since τ1 is unknown, it
must be estimated or averaged over some distribution. The individual survival probability evolves according to

3

+
= −(µ(τ, t|τ1 ) + c(τ, t|τ1 ))P (τ, t|τ1 ),

∂τ

(1)

where the death and recovery rates, µ(τ, t|τ1 ) and c(τ, t|τ1 ), depend explicitly on the duration of infection at time
t and implicitly on patient health and age a [27]. They may also depend explicitly on time t to reflect changes in
clinical policy or available health care. For example, enhanced medical care may decrease the death rate µ, giving the
individual’s intrinsic physiological processes a chance to cure the patient.
If we assume an initial condition of one individual having been infected for time τ1 at the time of confirmation,
Eq. 1 can be solved using the method of characteristics (see the SI). From the solution P (τ = t + τ1 , t|τ1 ) (see the
Methods) one can derive the probabilities of death and recovery by time t as
Z
Pd (t|τ1 ) =

t

t

Pr (t|τ1 ) =

0

ds c(τ1 + s, s)P (τ1 + s, t|τ1 ).

(2)

0

The probability that an individual died before time t, conditioned on resolution (either death or recovery), is then
defined as

M1 (t|τ1 ) =

Pd (t|τ1 )
.
Pd (t|τ1 ) + Pr (t|τ1 )

(3)

Equations (2) and (3) also depend on all other relevant patient attributes such as age, accessibility to health care, etc.
In the long-time limit, when resolution has occurred (Pd (∞) + Pr (∞) = 1), the individual mortality ratio is simply
M1 (∞) = Pd (∞). In order to capture the dependence of death and recovery rates on the time an individual has been
infected, we propose a constant recovery rate c and a piece-wise constant death rate µ(τ |τ1 ) that is not explicitly a
function of time t:
(
c(τ, t|τ1 ) = c,

µ(τ |τ1 ) =

0 τ ≤ τinc
,
µ1 τ > τinc

(4)

where τinc is the incubation time during which the patient is asymptomatic, has zero death rate, but can recover by
clearing the virus. In other words, some patients fully recover without ever developing serious symptoms.
For coronavirus infections, the incubation period appears to be highly variable with a mean of τinc ≈ 6.4 days [29].
We can estimate µ1 and c using individual patient data where 19 patients (outside Hubei) had been tracked from the
date on which their first symptoms occurred until the disease resolved [28].
Two out of 19 patients died, on average, 20.5 days after first symptoms occurred and the mean recovery time
of the remaining 17 patients is 16.8 days. We show the recovery-time distribution in Fig. 2(a). Since we know
that the mortality ratio in this dataset is 2/19, we can determine the dependence between µ1 and c according to
µ1 /(µ1 + c) ≈ 2/19 (or c/µ1 ≈ 8.5). The constant recovery and after-incubation period death rates [30] are estimated
to be
c=

1
/day ≈ 0.049/day
20.5

and

µ1 = c/8.5 ≈ 0.006/day.

(5)

Using these numbers, the recovery and death rate functions c(τ, t|τ1 ) and µ(τ |τ1 ) are plotted as functions of τ in
Fig. 2(b). We show the evolution of M1 (t|τ1 ) at different values of τ1 in Fig. 2(c). The corresponding long-time limit
M1 (∞) is readily apparent in Fig. 2(d): for τ1 ≥ τinc , M1 (∞) = µ1 /(µ1 +c) ≈ 0.105, while M1 (∞) < µ1 /(µ1 +c) when
τ1 < τinc . The smaller expected mortality associated with early identification of infection arises from the remaining
incubation time during which the patient has a chance to recover without possibility of death. When conditioned on
testing positive at or after the incubation period, the patient immediately suffers a positive death rate, increasing his
M1 (∞).
Finally, in order to infer M1 (and also indirectly µ and c) during an outbreak, a number of statistical issues must
be considered. First, if the outbreak is ongoing, there may not be sufficient long-time cohort data. Second, τ1 is
unknown. Since testing typically occurs at the onset of symptoms, most positive patients will have been infected a
few days earlier. The uncertainty in τ1 can be represented by a probability density ρ(τ1 ) for the individual. The
expected mortality can then be constructed as an average over ρ(τ1 ):

(6)

where P̄d (t) and P̄r (t) are the τ1 -averaged probabilities death and cure probabilities.
Some properties of the distribution ρ(τ1 ) can be inferred from the behavior of patients. Before symptoms arise, only
very few patients will know they have been infected, seek medical care, and get their case confirmed (i.e., ρ(τ1 ) ≈ 0
for τ1 ≈ 0). The majority of patients will contact hospitals/doctors when they have been infected for a duration of
τinc . The distribution ρ(τ1 ) thus reaches its maximum near or shortly after τinc . Since patients are most likely to test
positive after experiencing symptoms, we choose a gamma distribution

ρ(τ1 ; n, γ) =

γ n n−1 −γτ1
τ
e
Γ(n) 1

(7)

with shape parameter n = 8 and rate parameter γ = 1.25/day so that the mean n/γ is equal to τinc = 6.4.
Upon using the rates in Eqs. (4) and averaging over ρ(τ1 ), we derived expressions for P̄ (t), P̄d (t), and P̄r (t) which
are explicitly given in the SI. Using the values in Eq. (5) we find an expected individual mortality ratio M̄1 (t) (which
are subsequently plotted in Fig. 3) and its asymptotic value M̄1 (∞) = P̄d (∞) = 0.101. Of course, it is also possible to
account for more complex time-dependent forms of c and µ1 [31], but we will primarily use Eqs. (4) in our subsequent
analyses.
In the next section, we define population-based estimates for mortality ratios, Mp (t), and explore how they can
be computed using SIR-type models. By comparing M1 (t) to Mp (t), we gain insight into whether population-based
metrics are good proxies for individual mortality ratios. We will outline the mathematical differences and additional
errors that confound population-level estimates.

5
Infection duration-dependent SIR model

While individual mortalities can be estimated by tracking many individuals from infection to recovery or death,
oftentimes, the available data are not resolved at the individual level and only total populations are given. Typically,
one has the total number of cases accumulated up to time t, N (t), the number of deaths to date D(t), and the
number of cured/recovered patients to date R(t) (see Fig. 1). The CFR is simply D(t)/N (t). Note that N (t) includes
unresolved cases and that N (t) ≥ R(t) + D(t). Resolution (death or recovery) of all patients, N (∞) = R(∞) + D(∞),
occurs only well after the epidemic passes.
A variant of the CFR commonly used in the literature [3, 4] is the delayed CFR
D(t)
,
N (t − τres )

CFRd (t, τres ) =

(8)

where τres is a corresponding time lag that accounts for the duration from the day when first symptoms occurred
to the day of cure/death. Many estimates of the COVID-19 mortality ratio assume that τres = 0 [3, 4] and thus
underestimate the number of death cases D(t) that result from a certain number of infected individuals. Similar
underestimations using CFRd have been reported in previous epidemic outbreaks of SARS [13, 15] and Ebola [32].
Alternatively, a simple and interpretable population-level mortality ratio is Mp (t) = D(t)/(R(t) + D(t)), the death
ratio of all resolved cases. To provide a concrete model for D(t) and R(t), and hence Mp (t), we will use a variant of
the standard infection duration-dependent susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-type model described by [33]

and dR(t)/dt = 0 dτ c(τ, t)I(τ, t), where S(t) is the number of susceptibles, I(τ, t) is density of individuals at time t
who have been infected for time τ , and R(t) is the number of recovered individuals. The rate at which an individual
infected for time τ at time t transmits the infection to a susceptible is denoted by β(τ, t)S(t). For simplicity, we
assume only community spread and neglect immigration of infected, which can be straightforwardly incorporated
[33].
Note that the equation for I(τ, t) is identical to the equation for the survival probability described by Eq. (1). It
is also equivalent to McKendrick age-structured models [34, 35] [36]. Infection of susceptibles is described by the
boundary condition

which is similar to that used in age-structured models to represent birth [34]. Finally, we use an initial condition
consistent with the infection duration density given by Eq. (7): I(τ, 0) = ρ(τ ; n = 8, γ = 1.25). Note that Eq. (10)
assumes that all newly infected individuals are immediately identified; i.e., these newly infected individuals start with
τ1 = 0. After solving for the infected population density, the total number of deaths and recoveries to date can be
found via

(12)

In the definitions of D0 (t), R0 (t), and N0 (t), we account for all possible death and recovery cases to date (see SI)
and that newly infected individuals are immediately identified. We use these case numbers as approximations of the
reported case numbers to study the evolution of mortality-ratio estimates. Mortality ratios based on these numbers
underestimate the actual individual mortality M1 (see the previous “Intrinsic individual mortality rate” subsection)
since they involve individuals that have been infected for different durations τ , particularly recently infected individuals
who have not yet died.

6
An alternative way to compute populations is to exclude the newly infecteds and consider only the initial cohort.
The corresponding populations in this case are defined as

dτ c(τ, t0 )I(τ, t0 ).
(13)

t0

Since D1 (t) and R1 (t) do not include infecteds with τ < t, they exclude the effect of newly infected individuals, but
may yield more accurate mortality-ratios as they are based on an initial cohort of individuals in the distant past. The
infections that occur after t = 0 contribute only to I(τ < t, t); thus, D1 (t) and R1 (t) do not depend on the transmission
rate β, possible immigration of infecteds, or the number of susceptibles S(t). Note that all the populations derived
above implicitly average over ρ(τ1 ; n, γ) for the first cohort of identified infecteds (but not subsequent infecteds).
Moreover, the population density I(τ ≥ t, t) follows the same equation as P̄ (t|τ1 ) provided the same ρ(τ1 ; n, γ) is used
in their respective calculations.
The two different ways of partitioning populations (Eqs. (11) and (13)) lead to two different population-level
mortality ratios
Mp0 (t) =

D0 (t)
D0 (t) + R0 (t)

and Mp1 (t) =

D1 (t)
.
D1 (t) + R1 (t)

(14)

Since the populations D0 (t) and R0 (t), and hence Mp0 (t), depend on disease transmission through β(τ, t) and S(t),
we expect Mp0 (t) to carry a different interpretation from M1 (t) and Mp1 (t).

(15)

Thus, only in the special time-homogeneous case do both population-based mortality ratios become independent of
the population (and transmission β) and coincide with the individual death probability.
To illustrate the differences between M1 (t), Mp0,1 (t), and CFRd (t, τres ) in more general cases, we use the simple
death and cure rate functions given by Eqs. (4) in solving Eqs. (1) and (9). For β(τ, t) in Eq. (10), we account for
incubation effects by neglecting transmission during the asymptomatic incubation period (τ ≤ τinc ) and assume
(
0 τ ≤ τinc
β(τ, t) =
(16)
β1 τ > τinc .
We use the estimated basic reproductive number R0 = β1 S(0)/(µ1 + c) ≈ 2.91 [29] to fix β1 S(0) = (µ1 + c)R0 ≈
0.158/day. We also first assume that the susceptible population does not change appreciably before quarantine and
set S(t) = S(0). Thus, we only need to solve for I(τ, t) in Eqs. (9) and (10). We solve Eqs. (9) and (10) numerically
(see the Methods section for further details) and use these numerical solutions to compute D0,1 (t), R0,1 (t), and N0,1 (t)
(see Fig. 3(a) and (b)), which are then used in Eqs. (14) and CFRd (t − τres ). To determine a realistic value of the
time lag τres , we use data on death/recovery periods of 36 tracked patients [28] and find that patients recover/die, on
average, τres = 16.5 days after first symptoms occurred.
We show in Figs. 3(c) and (d) that Mp1 (t) approaches the individual mortality ratio M̄1 (∞) ≈ 0.1 given in the
“Intrinsic individual mortality rate” subsection above. This occurs because the model for P (τ, t) and I(τ, t) are
equivalent and we assumed the same initial distribution ρ(τ ; 8, 1.25) for both quantities. However, the populationlevel mortality ratios CFRd (t, τres ) and Mp0 (t) also take into account recently infected individuals who may recover
before symptoms. This difference yields different mortality ratios because newly infecteds are implicitly assumed to
be detected immediately and all have τ1 = 0. Thus, the underlying infection-time distribution is not the same as that
used to compute M̄p1 (t) (see the SI for further details). The mortality ratios CFRd (t, τres ) and Mp0 (t) should not be
used to quantify the individual mortality probability of individuals who tested positive. Moreover, due to evolution
of the disease, D(t), R(t), and N (t) do not change with the same rates during an outbreak, the population-level
mortality measures CFRd (t, τres ) and Mp0 (t) reach their final steady state values only after sufficiently long times (see
Fig. 3(c) and (d)).
The evolution of the mortality ratios in Fig. 3 qualitatively resembles the behavior of the mortality-ratio estimates
in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, the population-based estimates for coronavirus varies, decreasing in time for China
but fluctuating for Italy. These changes could result from changing practices in data collecting, or from explicitly
time-inhomogeneous parameters µ(τ, t), c(τ, t), and/or β(τ, t).

FIG. 3. Population-level mortality-ratio estimates. Outbreak evolution and mortality ratios without containment measures (a,c) and with quarantine (b,d). The curves are based on numerical solutions of Eqs. (9) using the initial condition
I(τ, 0) = ρ(τ ; 8, 1.25) (see Eq. (7)). The death and recovery rates are defined in Eqs. (4) and (5). We use a constant infection
rate β1 S(0) = 0.158/day, which we estimated from the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 [29]. To model quarantine
effects, we set β1 = 0 for t > 50. We show the mortality-ratio estimates Mp0 (t) and Mp1 (t) (see Eq. (14)) and CFRd (t, τres ) (see
Eqs. (8), (11), (12), and (14)).

Although population-level quarantining does not directly affect the individual mortality M1 (t|τ1 ) or M̄1 (t), it can
be easily incorporated into the SIR-type population dynamics equations through changes in β(τ, t)S(t). For example,
we have set S(t > tq ) = 0 to represent implementation of a quarantine after tq = 50 days of the outbreak. After
tq = 50 days, no new infections occur and the estimates CFRd (t, τres ) and Mp0 (t) start converging immediately towards
their steady-state values (see Fig. 3(d)). Since the number of deaths decreases after the implementation of quarantine
measures, the delayed CFRd (t, τres = 17) is first decreasing until t = tq + τres = 67. For t > 67, the CFRd (t, τres = 17)
measures no new cases and is thus equal to the CFR.

DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

During an epidemic, it is important to assess the severity of the disease by estimating its mortality and other disease
characteristics. Assuming accurate data, the often-used CFR typically underestimates the true, final death ratio. For
example, during the SARS outbreaks in Hong Kong, the WHO first estimated the fatality rate to 2.5% (March 30,
2003) whereas the final estimates reached values of about 17.0% (June 30, 2003) (see Fig. 4(a)) [16]. Standard metrics
like the CFR are seen to be easily confounded by and sensitive to uncertainty in intrinsic disease parameters such
as the incubation period and the time τ1 a patient had been infected before clinical confirmation of infection. For
the recent COVID-19 outbreaks, CFR-based measures may still provide reasonable estimates of the actual mortality
across different age classes due to a counter-acting error in the numbers of unreported mild-symptom cases.
Here, we stress that more mechanistically meaningful and interpretable metrics can be defined and, as easily,
estimated from population data as CFRs. Our proposed mortality ratios for viral epidemics are defined in terms of (i)
individual survival probabilities and (ii) population ratios using numbers of deaths and recovered individuals. Both of
these measures are based on the within-host evolution of the disease, and in the case of Mp0,1 (t), the population-level
transmission dynamics.
Among the metrics we describe, Mp1 (t) is structurally closest to the individual mortality M̄1 (t) in that both are
independent of disease transmission since new infections are not considered. Both of these mortality ratios converge

different regions (see Eqs. (8) and (14) (τres = 0)). We used data on the cumulative number of cases, recoveries, and deaths in
Ref. [14] as of March 24, 2020. The marker sizes indicate the population of the corresponding countries. The metrics Mp0 (t)
and and CFR are largely uncorrelated with correlation coefficient 0.33.

after an incubation time τinc to a value smaller than or equal to µ1 /(µ1 + c).
The most accurate estimates of M1 can be obtained if we keep track of the fate of cohorts that were infected within
a small time window in the past. By following only these individuals, one can track how many of them died as a
function of time. As more cases arise, one should stratify them according to their estimated times since infection to
gather improving statistics for M1 (∞). With the further spread of SARS-CoV-2 in different countries, data on more
individual cases of death and recovery can be more easily stratified according to other central factors in COVID-19
mortality: age, sex, health condition.
Besides accurate cohort data, for which at present there are few for coronavirus, cumulative population data has
been used to estimate the mortality ratio. The population-level metrics Mp0 (t) and CFR(t) implicitly depend on
new infections and the transmission rate β. Despite this confounding factor, Mp0 (t) and CFRd (t, τres ) approach
e−cτinc µ1 /(µ1 + c) as t → ∞, where e−cτinc is the probability that no recovery occurred during the incubation time
τinc . Based on these results, we can establish the following connection between the different mortality ratios for initial
infection times with distribution ρ(τ1 ; n, γ) and mean τ̄ = n/γ:
CFRd (∞) = Mp0 (∞) ≈ e−cτ̄ Mp1 (∞) = e−cτ̄ M̄1 (∞) .

(17)

According to Eq. (17), population-level mortality estimates (e.g., CFR and Mp0 ) can be transformed, at least approximately, into individual mortality probabilities using the correction factor e−cτ̄ with τ̄ ≈ τinc .
Besides the mathematical differences between M1 (t) and Mp0 (t), CFR, estimating Mp0 (t) and CFR(t) from aggregate
populations implicitly incorporate a number of confounding factors that contribute to their variability. In Fig. 4(b),
we plot the population-level mortality-ratio estimates Mp0 against the CFR for different regions and observe large
variations and very little correlation between countries [38]. As of March 31, 2020, the value of Mp0 in Italy is almost
45% and can increase further if the current conditions (e.g., treatment methods, age group proportion of infecteds,
etc.) do not change. Differences between the mortality ratios in China and Italy (see Figs. 1(b) and (c)) might be
a result of varying medical treatment strategies, different practices in data collecting (e.g., post-mortem testing),
differences in the age demographics between the countries, and/or inaccuracies in reporting.
Even if the cohort initially tested was only a fraction of the total infected population, tracking M̄1 (t) or Mp1 (t)
of this cohort still provides an accurate estimation of the mortality rate. However, underreporting newly infecteds
can confound CFR and Mp0 (t). Current estimates show that only a minority of SARS-CoV-2 infections are reported
(e.g., f ≈ 14% in China before January 23, 2020) [39]. At early times (Fig. S2(a)) most patients, tested or untested,
have not resolved. A reported/tested fraction f < 1 would not directly affect the CFRs or mortality ratios if
the unreported/untested individuals die and recover in the same proportion as the tested infecteds (Fig. S2(b)).
Undertesting would overestimate the true Mp0 (t) and infection fatality ratio (IFR) if untested (presumably mildly or
asymptomatic infected) individuals are less likely to die than the tested infecteds (Fig. S2(c)). If untested infecteds
0,1
do not die at all, the true long-time mortality M0,1
p (∞) ≈ f Mp (∞) (see the SI). In the less likely scenario in which
untested individuals do not receive medical care and hence die at a faster rate than tested patients (see Fig. S2(d)),
Mp0,1 (∞) and CFR based on the tested fraction would underestimate the true long-time mortality Mp0,1 (∞) and IFR,
respectively.

9
Besides underreporting, the delay in transmission after becoming infected will also affect Mp0 (t). Although we
have assumed that transmission occurs only after the incubation period when symptoms arise, there is evidence of
asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus [39, 40]. Asymptomatic transmission can be modeled by setting β(τ ) > 0
even for τ < τinc . An undelayed transmission in a no-quarantine scenario causes relatively more new infecteds who
have not had the chance to die yet, leading to a smaller mortality ratio Mp0 (t). Within our SIR model, delaying
transmission reduces the number of infected individuals and deaths at any given time but increases the measured
mortality ratio Mp0 (t). Without quarantine, the asymptotic values Mp0 (∞) and CFR(∞) will also change as a result
of changing the transmission latency period, as shown in the SI. With perfect quarantining, the asymptote Mp0 (∞) is
eventually determined by a cohort that does not include new infections and is thus independent of the transmission
delay.
In this work, we have explicitly defined a number of interpretable mathematical metrics that represent the probability of dying from a disease By rigorously defining these metrics, we are able to reveal the inherent assumptions
and factors that affect their estimation. Within survival probability and SIR-type models, we explicitly illustrate how
physiologically important parameters such as incubation time, death rate, cure rate, and transmissibility influence the
temporal evolution and asymptotic values of mortality ratios. We also discussed how statistical factors such as time
of testing after infection (τ1 ) and testing ratio (f ) affect our estimates. In practice, the mortality ratios M1 (t) and
Mp1 (t) may provide good estimates of mortality of patients who have tested positive. In addition to our metrics and
mathematical models, we emphasize the importance of curating individual cohort data. These data are more directly
related to the probability of death M1 (t) and are subject to the fewest confounding factors and statistical uncertainty.

METHODS
Numerical scheme

To numerically solve Eqs. (9) and (10), we use a uniform discretization τk = k∆τ, k = 0, 1, . . . , K. A backward
difference operator [I(τk , t) − I(τk−1 , t)] /(∆τ ) is used to approximate ∂τ I(τ, t) and a predictor-corrector Euler scheme
is used to advance time [41]. Setting the cut-offs I(−∆τ, t) ≡ 0 and I(K∆τ, t) ≡ 0, the resulting discretized equations
for the full SIR model are

K = 104 . In the SI, we show additional plots of the magnitude of I(τ, t) in the t − τ plane.

FIG. 5. Phase plot for P (τ > t, t) and I(τ > t, t). The regions delineating different forms for the solution (Eq. (23)). Here,
we have included an incubation time τinc before which no death occurs. The solution for P̄ (τ, t) or I(τ, t) in the τ < t region
must be self-consistently solved using the boundary condition Eq. (10). At any fixed time, the integral of I(τ, t) over t < τ ≤ ∞
captures only the initial population, excludes newly infecteds, and is used to compute D1 (t), R1 (t), and Mp1 (t). To compute
D0 (t), R0 (t), and Mp0 (t), we integrate across all infecteds (including the integral over t > τ >≥ 0 shown in magenta).

Finally, we can also find the τ1 -averaged probabilities for τ ≥ t by weighting over ρ(τ1 ; n, γ). For example,


τ ≥ t + τinc

These solutions hold for the different regions shown in the phase plot of Fig. 5 and are equivalent to those for
I(τ > t, t). Corresponding expressions for P̄d (t) and P̄r (t) can be found and used to construct Mp1 (t). Fig. 6(a) shows
the magnitude of I(τ, t) in the t − τ plane when we set S(t) = S constant (so that the first equation in Eq. (18) does
not apply) such that β1 S ≈ 0.158/day. In this case, the epidemic continues to grow in time, but the mortality rates
Mp0,1 (t) nonetheless converge as t → ∞. In Fig. 6(b), we set β1 S = 0 for t > tq to model strict quarantining after
tq = 50 days. We observe no new infections after the onset of strict quarantine measures. In both cases (quarantine
and no quarantine), we use ρ(τ ; n = 8, γ = 1.25) (see Eq. (7) in the main text) to describe the initial distribution of
infection times τ . As time progresses, more of the distribution of τ moves towards smaller values until quarantine
measures take effect (see Fig. 6(c) and (d)).

assumption of a fixed susceptible size β1 S = 0.158/day. (a) The density without quarantine monotonically grows with time t
in the region τ < t as an unlimited number of susceptibles continually produces infecteds. (b) With quarantining after tq = 50
days, we set β1 S = 0 for t > tq , which shuts off new infections. Both plots were generated using the same initial density ρ(τ1 )
defined in Eq. (7). In both cases, the density I(τ > t) is identical to P (τ > t) if the same ρ(τ1 ) is used and is independent of
disease transmission, susceptible dynamics, etc. (c-d) Probability-density functions (PDFs) of the number of infected I(τ, t) for

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Additional examples of mortality-ratio evolutions

FIG. S1. Mortality ratio estimates. Estimates of mortality ratios (see Eqs. (8) and (14) in the main text) of SARS-CoV-2
infections in different countries. The case fatality rate, CFR, corresponds to the number of deaths to date divided by the total
number of cases to date. Another population-based mortality ratio is Mp0 (t), the number of deaths divided by the sum of deaths
and recovereds, up to time t. The data are derived from Ref. [14].

In Fig. S1, we show additional examples of mortality-ratio estimates for Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany,
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. As in Fig. 1 in the main text, we observe that, by definition, the populationbased mortality ratio Mp0 (t) is significantly larger than the corresponding CFR in all cases.
Effects of undertesting

Note that I(τ, t) in the SIR equations determines the dynamics of the actual infected population. However, (i)
typically only a fraction f of the total number of infecteds might be tested and confirmed positive and (ii) the testing
of newly infecteds may also be delayed by a distribution ρ(τ ; n, γ).
If positive tests represent only a fraction f of the total infected population, and the confirmation of newly infecteds
occurs immediately, the known infected density is given by I ∗ (τ, t) = f I(τ, t) where I(τ, t) is the true total Rinfected
τ
population. If testing of newly infecteds occurs after a distribution ρ(τ ; n, γ) of infection times, I ∗ (τ, t) = f 0 I(t −
τ + τ1 , t)ρ(τ1 ; n, γ)dτ1 .

2
In our development of Mp0,1 (t) and CFRd (t, τres ) in the manuscript, we assumed the entire infected population was
tested and confirmed. Thus, Mp0,1 (t) and CFRd (t, τres ) were computed using f = 1 and more accurately represent the
mortality ratios of the population conditioned on being tested positive.

FIG. S2. Fractional testing. An example of fractional testing in which a fixed fraction f of the real total infected population
is assumed to be tested. The remaining 1 − f proportion of infecteds are untested. Equivalently, if the total tested fraction has
unit population, then the total population of the untested pool is 1/f − 1. (a) At short times after an outbreak, most of the
infected patients, tested and untested, have not yet resolved (red). Only a small number have died (gray) or have recovered
(green). (b) At later times, if the untested population dies at the same rate as the tested population, Mp (t) and CFR remain
accurate estimates for the entire infected population. (c) If the untested population is, say, asymptomatic and rarely dies,
0,1
0,1
the true mortality M0,1
p (t) ≈ f Mp (t) is overestimated by the tested mortality Mp (t). (d) Finally, in a scenario in which
untested infecteds die at a higher rate than tested ones, Mp0,1 (t) and CFR based on the tested fraction underestimate the true
mortalities.

To estimate the mortality ratio of the population conditioned simply on being infected, we have to estimate the
larger number of recovereds that went untested. For the most likely scenario in which untested infecteds have negligible
death rate, as shown in Fig. S2(c), we can employ the SIR model without death for the untested pool of infecteds,

Here, we have assumed that testing occurs only for the infected who can die. In this scenario, the IFR, or the true
CFR of all infecteds, is then IFR(t) = D0∗ (t)/NT (t), where in analogy to Eqs. (11) and (12),

which yields the asymptotic true ratio M0,1
p (∞) = f Mp (∞) as described in the Discussion and Summary. In this
simple rescaling to account for untested populations, we have assumed that all deaths come from the tested pool and
that the recovery rate c is the same in the tested and untested pools.

Influence of different transmission rates

In Fig. 3 of the main text, we observe that the population-level mortality ratio Mp0 (t) approaches a plateau during
the initial exponential growth phase of an epidemic (i.e., for S(t) ≈ S0 ). If the number of new infections decreases
(e.g., due to quarantine measures), Mp0 (t) starts growing until it reaches its asymptotic value Mp0 (∞). Interestingly,
the pre-asymptotic values of Mp0 (t) are smaller for larger infection rates β1 (see Fig. S3(a)). This counter-intuitive
effect arises because larger values of β1 generate relatively larger numbers of new infected which have a lower chance
of dying before τinc (see Eq. (4) in the main text). A similar effect occurs for non-delayed transmission (i.e., τβ ≈ 0).

FIG. S3. Population-level mortality for different infection rates. (a) The population-level mortality ratio Mp0 (t) for
different values of β1 and an incubation time of τinc = 6.4 days. In the initial exponential growth phase of the epidemic
(i.e., S(t) ≈ S0 ), larger infection rates β1 lead to smaller values of Mp0 (t). (b) We observe a similar effect for non-delayed
transmissions (i.e., τβ ≈ 0). As long as S(t) ≈ S0 , smaller transmission delays τβ lead to larger relative numbers of new
infections and smaller Mp0 (t).

As the transmission delay decreases, more secondary cases will result from one infection, leading to smaller values of
Mp0 (t) in the initial exponential growth phase of an epidemic (see Fig. S3(b)).
