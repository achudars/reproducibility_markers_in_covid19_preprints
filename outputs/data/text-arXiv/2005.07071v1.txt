Abstract
Background: The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic dilated rapidly throughout India. To end the global
COVID-19 pandemic major behavioral, social distancing, contact tracing, and state interventions has
been undertaken to reduce the outbreak and avert the persistence of the coronavirus in humans in India
and worldwide. In absence of any vaccine or therapeutics, forecasting is of utmost priority for health care
planning and control the transmission of COVID-19.
Methods: We have proposed a mathematical model that explain the transmission dynamics of
COVID-19 in India. Based on the estimated data our model predicts the evolution of epidemics and
the end of SARS-CoV-2 and aids to evaluate the influence of different policies to control the spread of the
diseases.
Findings: With the real data for infected individuals, we find the basic reproduction number R0 for
17 states of India and overall India. A complete figure is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic
life cycle along with the real data or history to date. Our study reveals that the strict control measures
implemented in India substantially mitigated the disseminate of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, model simulations predict that 95% reduction of outbreak on June 26, 2020 and 99% reduction of outbreak on July
26, 2020 in India.
Interpretation: Our model simulation demonstrates that the community-wide elimination of SARSCoV-2 is possible by mitigating the social distancing and use essential precautions. Lockdown can be
implemented strictly to prevent the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. The model-based and
parameter estimation of epidemic life cycle, and end dates, if can be done precisely, may decrease distress
and over optimism and develop the mentality for all of us for the next stages of the outbreak evolution.

1. Introduction
The ongoing coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has been announced a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 [1], and in the first phase the Govt. of India has announced 21 days
nationwide lockdown from March 25, 2020 to April 14, 2020, and in the second phase the lockdown has been
extended to May 03, 2020 to prevent stage-III spreading of the virus or human-to-human transmission [2].
According to the WHO report dated April 09, 2020 reported 3,855,812 total confirmed cases and 2,65,862
confirmed deaths worldwide [3]. COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 has already surpassed the earlier history of
two coronavirus outbreaks, namely SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus) and
MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), posing the substantial endanger to the
world-wide public health as well as global economy after the 2nd world war [4]. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits
distinctive epidemiological traits collated with coronavirus epidemics of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The outbreak was first announced by the “Health Commission of Hubei province”, China, a cluster
of unexplained cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology (unknown cases) [5], which is lethal, was first
identified in Wuhan city of Hubei province, China, on December 31, 2019 [28, 7]. After that an exceptionally large number of patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in mainland of China, prodding Chinese
Governments to initiate stringent measures to control the epidemic [5]. In spite of these precautions,
SERS-CoV-2 pandemic evolved in the following months. The confirmed cases of COVID-19, the symptoms like sneeze, fever, or even a runny nose, dry cough, fatigue, breathing problem and bilateral lung
infiltration to severely ill and dying. Due to the human mobility, this communicable disease has now
spread throughout the world, making USA and Europe as new epicenters [4].
The first indigenous case of COVID-19 in India was reported on January 30, 2020 in Thrissur district
of Kerala and the patient, a student of Wuhan University, China [8]. The authorities recommend the
level of infection could be assload as the India’s testing rates are very poor among the world [9]. The
rate of infection of SARS-CoV-2 in India is chronicled to be 1.7 (that is, one coronavirus positive infects
1.7 in India), materially lower than in hot zones [10]. The estimated basic reproduction number R0 for
COVID-19 ranges from 2.0 to 3.5 [18, 19], that seems similar, or perhaps higher than that of SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV. Higher level of viral loads for COVID-19 were observed in upper respiratory specimens
of symptomatic patients resulting little or no symptoms, with a viral shedding pattern similar to that of
influenza viruses [20]. Thus, uncertain viral transmission may take part a crucial and underestimated role
in sustaining the epidemic.
India has suspended all the tourist visas as the majority of confirmed coronavirus cases were connected
to other countries [11]. Governments will not be competent to reduce both fatalities from SARS-CoV-2
epidemic and the economic impact of viral outbreak. Maintaining the fatality rate as low as possible will
be the utmost importance for the populations; therefore the Governments must put in place measures
2

to mitigate the unavoidable economic downturn. Due to absence of any specific pharmaceutical interventions, government of various countries are imposing different strategies to prevent this outbreak and
the lockdown is the most common one. As for examples, the measures adopted in this time incorporated
social distancing, closing schools, universities, offices, churches, bars, avoid mass gatherings, other social
places as well as contact of cases (quarantine, surveillance, contact tracing) [12]. On March 19, 2020 the
Govt. of India suspended all the international flights till March 22, 2020 [16], and on March 23, 2020
the union Govt. also suspended all the domestic flights till March 25, 2020 [17] to maintain the social
distancing among the people. The prime minister of India has announced a 14 hours voluntary public
curfew (’Janata Curfew’) on March 22, 2020 as a precautionary measure to combat against COVID-19.
The Govt. of India followed it up with lockdowns on March 23, 2020 to prevent the emanating threat
in 75 districts across the country including major cities where the COVID-19 infection was endemic [13].
Furthermore, on March 24, 2020 the Govt. of India has ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days,
overwhelming the entire 1.3 billion public in India [14], and the lockdown has been extended to May 03,
2020 to prevent stage-III spreading of the virus or human-to-human transmission [15].
Predictive mathematical models play a key role to understand the course of the epidemic and for
designing strategies to contain quickly spreading infectious diseases in lack of any specific antivirals or
effective vaccine [21, 22, 23]. In the year 1927, Kermack & McKendrick [24] developed a fundamental
epidemic model for human-to-human transmission to describe the dynamics of populations through three
mutually exclusive phages of infection, namely susceptible (S), infected (I) and removed (R) classes.
Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases are now ubiquitous and many of them can precisely depict
the dynamic spread of particular epidemics. Several mathematical models has been developed to study
the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic. A Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People network model has
been developed by Chen et al. [25] to study the transmission dynamics of novel coronavirus. Lin et al. [26]
extended the SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) compartment model to study the dynamics
of COVID-19 incorporating public perception of risk and the number of cumulative cases. Khajanchi et
al. [38] studied an extended SEIR model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and perform a
short-term prediction based on the data from India. A discrete-time SIR (susceptible-infectious-removed)
model introducing dead compartment system studied by Anastassopoulou et al. [27] to portray the
dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak. Wu et al. [28] studied a SEIR model to investigate the dynamics of
2019-nCoV human-human transmission dynamics based on the data from Wuhan, China from December
31, 2019 to January 28, 2020 and calculate the basic reproduction number was approximately 2.68. Wu
et al. [29] used a SIR model to delineate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and also estimate the
clinical severity for the coronavirus. To study the dynamics of COVID-19, a stochastic transmission model
also developed by Kucharski et al. [30]. Here, we developed a new epidemiological mathematical model for

3

novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in India that extends the standard SEIR compartment model,
alike to that studied by Tang et. al. [31] for COVID-19. The transmission dynamics of our proposed
model for COVID-19 is illustrated in the Figure 1.

2. Dynamic model without effective control measures
We develop here a classical SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered)-type epidemiological model
by introducing contact tracing and other interventions such as quarantine, lockdown, social distancing
and isolation that can represent the overall dynamics of novel coronavirus or COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2). The model, named SARIIq Sq , monitors the dynamics of six compartments (classes), namely susceptible individuals (S) (uninfected), quarantined susceptible individuals (Sq ) (quarantined at home),
infectious but not yet symptomatic or asymptomatic infectious individuals (A), infected or infectious
with symptoms/clinically ill (I), isolated infected individuals (Iq ) (infected or life-threatening or detected) and the recovered compartment (R) (no more infectious). The total size of the individuals is
N = S + Sq + A + I + Iq + R. In our model, quarantine describes the separation of coronavirus infected
populations from the susceptible individuals before progression of clinical symptoms, whereas the isolation
refers to the dissociation of coronavirus infected populations with such clinical symptoms. The rate of
change in each compartments at any time t is represented by the following system of nonlinear ordinary
differential equations:

Iq (t0 ) = Iq0 and R(t0 ) = R0 .

(2)

Herein, t ≥ t0 represents time in days and t0 indicates the starting date for the system of the coronavirus
epidemic.
In our model construction, βs represents the probability of transmission per contact between an infective and a susceptible class, and εs is denoted by the daily contact rate per unit of time. Here the
parameter β = βs εs is explicitly associated with the measures like lock-down, social distancing, shaking
4

hand, coughing and sneezing etc., which exactly decrease the number of social contacts. By enforcing contact tracing, a proportion ρs , of individuals exposed to the coronavirus is quarantined. The quarantined
classes can either move to the compartment Sq or Iq , depending on whether they are effectively infected
individuals or not, whereas the another proportion 1 − ρs , consists of populations exposed to the coronavirus who are missed from contact tracing and move to the infectious class I (once infected) or remaining
in susceptible class S (if uninfected). Then the quarantined classes, if uninfected (or infected), move to
the class Sq (or Iq ) at a rate of (1 − βs )ρs εs (or βs ρs εs ). Those who are not quarantined individuals,
but asymptomatic infectious individuals, will move to the asymptomatic compartment A at the rate of
βs (1 − ρs )εs . The proportion ρs (0 < ρs < 1) encapsulates the effectiveness of different individual preventive measures, such as cough etiquettes, frequently wash hand by soap and use sanitizer etc. We utilize a
constant ms to indicate the transition rate from the susceptible individuals to the (COVID-19) quarantined susceptible class due to fever and/or illness-like clinical symptoms. We symbolize ξa , ξi and ξq are
the rates of recovery individuals of asymptomatic class, symptomatic or clinically ill patients and isolated
individuals, respectively. Our model introduces some demographic effects by considering a proportional
natural decay rate δ in each of the six individuals, and Λs represents the constant inflow of susceptible
individuals. Asymptomatic population develop to infected population at the rate γa , so the average time
spent in the asymptotic class is

1
γa

per unit time. In similar fashion,

1
γi

represents the mean duration

for infected individuals. We ignore the rate of probability of transforming susceptible again after having
cured (recovered) from the disease infection. It is to be noted that our SARIIq Sq model did not take into
account many important ingredients that take part a key role in the transmission dynamics of COVID-19
such as the influence of the latency period, the inhomogeneous disease transmission network, the influence
of the measures already considered to fight the coronavirus diseases, the features of the individuals (for
example, the influence of the stage-structure, individuals who are already medically unfit).
2.1. Basic reproduction number
The basic reproduction number, symbolized by R0 , is ‘the expected number of secondary cases produced, in a completely susceptible population, by a typical infective individual’ [32, 33]. The dimensionless
basic reproduction number provides a threshold, which play a crucial role in determining the disease persists or dies out from the individual. In a more general way the basic reproduction number R0 can be
stated as the number of new infections created by a typical infective population at a disease free equilibrium. R0 < 1 determines on average an infected population creates less than one new infected population
during the course of its infective period, and the infection can die out. In reverse way, R0 > 1 determines each infected population creates, on average, more than one new infection, and the disease can
spread over the population. The basic reproduction number R0 can be computed by using the concept
of next generation matrix [32, 33]. In order to do this, we consider the nonnegative matrix F and the

3. Model calibration and data source
We calibrated our SARIIq Sq model for COVID-19 to the daily new infected cases and cumulative
confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 viruses for 17 provinces of India, namely Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat,
Hariyana, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan,
Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and the overall India with real data
till April 30, 2020. The description of the SARIIq Sq model are given in Table 1, list of key estimated
parameter values are specified in Table 2 and estimated initial population size are given in the Table 3.
By calibrating the SARIIq Sq model parameters with real data up to 30 April 2020, we make an attempt
to forecast the evolution of the epidemic in India and 17 provinces of India. In the model exploration,
we did not consider the demographic effects because of the short epidemic time scale in compare to the
demographic time scale, that is, Λs = δ = 0.
3.1. Parameter estimation
The most important challenge in any mathematical model based study is to estimate the model parameters and the initial population size. The solution of the SARIIq Sq model system (1) depends on both the
parameter values and initial population size. The model parameters have been estimated assuming the
initial population size and fitting the model simulation with the observed COVID-19 cases. The assumed
initial population sizes are presented in the Table 3. We have estimated six parameters, probability of
disease transmission (βs ), quarantined rate of susceptible individuals (ρs ), contact rate of entire individ-

7

uals (ǫs ), probability rate at which asymptomatic individuals develop clinical symptoms (γa ), recovery
rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (ξa ) and rate of recovery for infected individuals (ξi ). The
parameters are estimated from the observed daily new COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Although, we
have shown the plot validating model simulation for cumulative cases, the parameters are not estimated
from confirmed cumulative COVID-19 cases to optimize the error in parameter estimation [39] and errors
are listed in the Table 5.
4. Numerical simulation
Initially we have validated the model simulation with the observed COVID-19 cases. Model simulated
from the first date of coronavirus infection and up to 30 April, 2020 for whole India and for seventeen
states of India. The model simulation fitted with the observed daily new COVID-19 cases and cumulative
COVID-19 cases. The parameter values are taken from Table 1 and the Table 2 and the initial population
size from Table 3. Figures 2, 3 and 4 shows the observed COVID-19 cases and model simulations. Observed
data points are displayed in the red dot histogram and the blue curve represents the best fitting curve
for the model simulation. The first and third rows in each of these figures represents the daily new cases
of coronavirus diseases, whereas the second and fourth rows represents the cumulative confirmed cases
of COVID-19. In all the states of India except Telangana, the number of daily new COVID-19 cases is
increasing and the model capture this increasing trend very well. However, in Telanga, the number of
daily new COVID-19 cases starts decreasing from 12 April, 2020 onwards and our model captures this
trend successfully (see the Figure 4).
To measure the accuracy of fitting, we have computed Mean Absolute Error (EMAE ) and Root Mean
Square Error (ERMSE ). The EMAE and ERMSE are defined as follows:

EMAE =

Σni=1 |C(i) − S(i)|
,
n

r

Σni=1 (C(i) − S(i))2
n
where C(i) represents the observed value, S(i) is the model simulation and n is the sample size of the
ERMSE =

observed data. The values of EMAE and ERMSE for the seventeen states and for whole India are listed in
the Table 5. Our model performs excellently well in all the provinces. The values of EMAE and ERMSE
for whole India are 114.0705 and 187.4646 respectively. Also for all the states of India, the value of EMAE
varies from 2.3084 to 53.2686 and the value of ERMSE varies from 3.7892 to 54.9932.
4.1. Sensitivity analysis for R0
To describe how best to minimize individuals impermanence and morbidity due to SARS-CoV-2, it
is important to see the relative significance of various ingredients responsible for disease transmission.
8

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is directly related to the basic reproduction number R0 . We compute
the sensitivity indices for R0 for the parameters of the SARIIq Sq model. This indices apprise us how
important each parameter is to disease transmission. Sensitivity analysis is mainly used to describe the
robustness of the model predictions to the parameters, as there are generally errors in collection of data
and assumed parameter values. Sensitivity indices quantify the relative change in a state variable when a
parameter alters. The normalized forward sensitivity index for R0 , with respect to the disease transmission
coefficient βs can be defined as follows:
0
ΥR
βs

=

∂R0
βs
×
= 1,
∂βs
R0

which demonstrates that R0 is a increasing function of βs . This implies that probability of disease
transmission has a high influence on COVID-19 control and management. The sensitivity indices of other
parameters are given in the Table 4. In the Table 4, some of the indices are positive (and some are negative)
which means if the parameter increases then increase the value of R0 (and if the parameter increases then
decrease the value of R0 ). To control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, we must select the most sensitive
parameters who have most influence to reduce the diseases. As for example, the transmission rate βs has
an impact in reducing the COVID-19 diseases, which can easily be observed from the Table 4. Therefore,
we draw the contour plots for R0 in the Figure 7 dependence on the rate of disease transmission probability
βs and the quarantine rate ρs . Contour plot shows that for the higher values of βs the reproduction number
R0 increases significantly, which means that the SARS-CoV-2 disease will persist among the human and
spread throughout the community if the public not take the preventive measures. Thus, to control R0
must reduce the disease transmission coefficient βs and increase the period of quarantine rate ρs . Thus,
we may conclude that to end the COVID-19 outbreak enhance the quarantine and reduce the probability
of disease transmission following contact tracing, social distancing, limit or stop theaters and cultural
programme etc.
4.2. Effect of lockdown
To investigate the influence of intervention policies in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 viruses, we modified
the disease transmission rate βs by (1 − ω)βs with 0 < ω < 1, where ω encapsulates the efficacy of
different individuals precautionary measures. Intervention strategies including the most recent lockdown
progressively implemented since 25 March 2020, have influenced the spread of the outbreak. We also
predict our model for 17 provinces of India and overall India, involving social distancing to control COVID19.
For the estimated model parameters, before 3rd phase of lockdown (ω = 0) the basic reproduction
number was R0 = 2.0490 that followed in a significant outbreak of COVID-19. The 3rd phase lockdown
in India, has been implemented from 04 May 2020 and we divide into three time periods, first time
9

period from 04 May 2020 to 17 May 2020, second time period from 18 May 2020 to 31 May 2020 and
third time period from 01 June 2020 to 16 August 2020. In the first time window, R0 = 1.6392 as an
outcome of the inclusion of lockdown, social distancing, hygiene precautions, and early measures by Indian
Govt. (e.g. closing school, shopping mall etc.). In the second time window, the country-wide lockdown
was implemented but not yet enforced, as result R0 = 1.0245. The effectiveness of COVID-19 has been
reduced due to lockdown but need to impose more restriction. The nation-wide lockdown was implemented
in the third time period with strictly enforced, as a result R0 = 0.4098 reached below 1. The top panel
of the Figure 6 shows the effect of lockdown in three different time periods. Figure 6 predict that on 17
May 2020, the cumulative number of COVID-19 infected population in India without Phase-3 lockdown
is 70948 but after strictly enforcing nation-wide Phase-3 lockdown in India the cumulative number of
infected population reduced and it will be 64838. Another interesting outcome can be noticed as an effect
of nation-wide lockdown is the appearance of epidemic peak. The effect of lockdown not only reduce the
infected population but also causes delay in an appearance of the peak, which has shown the bottom panel
of the Figure 6. The bottom panel of Figure 6 exhibits that the infected population reaches its peak at a
different time.
4.3. Model prediction
The first positive COVID-19 cases was observed in India on 30 January, 2020 and 02 March, 2020
onward and multiple new cases have been reported from all over the country. Forecast of the pandemic
is most essential to take necessary administrative actions and health care planning and precautions. To
estimate the end date of the pandemic, we have numerically simulated SARIIq Sq model and estimated
the end days of COVID-19 infection. The numerical simulation of the model depends on the value of the
parameters estimated and the parameters have been estimated from the observed data up to 30 April,
2020. So, if more observed data are available, the parameters values will alter and the long time prediction
will be more accurate. However, this prediction gives us an overview of the pandemic, which will lead to
decide future planning. In this study, we fitted SARIIq Sq model to forecast the pandemic trend over the
period after 30 April, 2020 by using the observed data from the first day of infection to 30 April, 2020 at
national and state level.
Starting from the date of first COVID-19 case reported, we have simulated the SARIIq Sq model for
260 days for each states and for whole India to study the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 diseases. The
simulated daily new COVID-19 cases are plotted for 175 days and for 200 days only for Kerala and for
whole India in Figures 10, 11 and 12. The end date of the pandemic is the last date of COVID-19 case
report. However, to take administrative decisions it is more essential to know the proportions of total
infected populations rather estimating the end date of the pandemic. We have estimated the dates to
reach 95% and 99% of the expected total infected COVID-19 cases in India and seventeen states of India.
10

The dates are estimated by computing the total area under the simulated curve and finding the days
upto which 95% or 99% area are enclosed. The model simulated forecasting with 95% and 99% end dates
are shown in the Figures 10, 11 and 12. The blue curve represents the model forecast for the daily new
confirmed cases of coronavirus diseases while the red dot histogram represents the observed cases. The
dotted line represents the 95% end date and dash-dot line represents the 99% end date.
The 95% end date of India is 26 June, 2020 and 99% end date of India is 27 July, 2020. The 95%
and 99% end dates are different for different states of India. We have observed that the 95% end date of
states are on or before 26 June 2020 except for the states Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu,
Bihar and Odisha. Also, the 99% end of thirteen states are on or before 26 July, 2020 but the 99% end
date of Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Odisha are 30 July, 1 August, 3 August and 5 August,
respectively. That is the 99% end days deviates 10 days from the 99% end day of India.

5. Discussion
We have investigated a methodology in estimating the crucial epidemiological model parameters as
well as the modeling and prediction of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 17 different provinces of
India and the overall India by evaluating publicly accessible real data till April 30, 2020.
Our model simulations provide an important tool to evaluate the consequences of possible policies,
incorporating social distancing and lockdown. Our model findings, obtained by combining the SARIIq Sq
model with the accessible data regarding the coronavirus outbreak in India, indicate that imposing social
distancing is crucial, essential and effectual, in line with other details in the literature [28]. If the strong
lockdown can be imposed earlier, the effective results can be achieved. We accept these indications can
be handy to control the outbreak in India, together with the countries that are still in the early phases of
epidemic.
The future is always unpredictable and we must keep this in mind when we read any kind of predictions.
No one forecasted the outbreak of COVID-19 in India and worldwide, however Bill Gates warned about
the potential harm of a worldwide infectious disease in a speech in 2015. Based on the real data on
COVID-19 pandemic in India till April 30, 2020 we predicted our SARIIq Sq model. The total forecasted
infected individual size is the total area under the curve. Our model forecasts give the following two
estimates of end dates: (i) the date to reach 95% of expected total number of cases and (ii) the date to
reach 99% of expected total number of cases. At the end, we want to conclude that the number of infected
individuals may increase in India and the 17 provinces of India for the next few months if human-tohuman transmission and personal preventive measure resume with the existing rates as the testing status
are very poor in India. It is worthy to mention that the researchers around the world is working for
effective vaccine and/or therapeutics against coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 diseases and the existence of

Figure 6: Effect of nation-wide lockdown. Epidemic evolution predicted by the SARIIq Sq model for SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in
India for the time period 30 January 2020 to 16 August 2020. Before implemented 3rd Phase lockdown, the social distancing
are not enforced, resulting a larger R0 = 2.0490. After implementation of 3rd phase lockdown, the social distancing are
enforced but not strong enough, as a result larger R0 = 1.6302 and R0 = 1.0245, which shows a substantial outbreak
of COVID-19. But after implementation of fully operational and strict lockdown, after 31 May 2020, resulting a smaller
R0 = 0.4098, yields below 1. Bottom panel shows the trajectories of COVID-19 diseases for different values of the strengthen
of the intervention ω.

Figure 8: Contour plots of basic reproduction number R0 . Contour plots of R0 for six different provinces of India, with respect
to the probability of disease transmission rate βs and the quarantined rate ρs of susceptible individuals. All parameter values
other than βs and ρs are listed in the Table 2. The contour plots demonstrates that higher disease transmission probability
of the COVID-19 virus will remarkably increase the reproduction number R0 .

such pharmaceutical interventions will remarkably change the results.
In the modern and developed world, data and detailed information regarding the COVID-19 or SARSCoV-2 and the evolution of epidemic become accessible at an unparalleled pace. Howbeit, important
questions still remain undetermined and precise answers for forecasting the transmission dynamics of the
epidemic simply cannot be acquired at this stage. We emphasize the uncertainty of accessible authentic
data, specially concerning to the accurate baseline number of infected individuals, which may guide to
the equivocal outcomes and inappropriate predictions by orders of size, as also identified by the other
researches [35]. We hope that our predictions will be handy for Govt. and different companies as well as
the people towards making resolutions and considering the suitable actions that contain the spreading of
the coronavirus to the possible stage.

Table 2: Parameter values estimated from the observed daily new cases of COVID-19 in India and for 17 different provinces
of India. Six sensitive parameters βs , ρs , εs , γa , ξa and ξi are estimated among nine system parameters. The parameters
are estimated by fitting time series solution of the SARIIq Sq model with the observed daily new cases of COVID-19 using
the least square technique. Also, we compute the basic reproduction number R0 for 17 different provinces of India and the
