Title: An ARIMA model to forecast the spread and the final size of COVID-2019 epidemic in
Italy.
Author. Gaetano Perone. Affiliation. University of Bergamo.
Abstract
Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) is a severe ongoing novel pandemic that is spreading quickly across
the world. Italy, that is widely considered one of the main epicenters of the pandemic, has registered the
highest COVID-2019 death rates and death toll in the world, to the present day. In this article I estimate an
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast the epidemic trend over the period
after April 4, 2020, by using the Italian epidemiological data at national and regional level. The data refer
to the number of daily confirmed cases officially registered by the Italian Ministry of Health
(www.salute.gov.it) for the period February 20 to April 4, 2020. The main advantage of this model is that
it is easy to manage and fit. Moreover, it may give a first understanding of the basic trends, by suggesting
the hypothetic epidemic's inflection point and final size.

to other regions and countries.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) is a severe ongoing novel pandemic that has emerged in Hubei, a
central province of China, in December 2019. In few months, it has spread quickly across the world, and
at the time of writing has affected more than 200 countries and has caused about tens of thousands of deaths.
The most affected country are China, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and USA. Italy is considered one of
the main epicentres of the pandemic due to its pretty high death rates (12.33%) and death toll (15,362),1
and it represents the nucleus of this short paper.
When an epidemic occurs, one of the crucial questions is to determine its evolution and inflection point.
So, the main aim of this paper is to provide a short-term forecast of the COVID-2019 diffusion in Italy, by
using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model on national and selected regional data,
over the period after April 4, 2020. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, I will provide an
explanation of the data used in the econometric analysis. In section 3 I will discuss the empirical strategy
and the main results of ARIMA models. Finally, in section 4 I will stress the possible meaning of the results.

On April 4, 2020, Italy had the world’s highest death rates and death toll due to COVID-2019.

2. Data description
The data used in this analysis refer to the number of new daily COVID-2019 confirmed cases from February
20, 2020 to April 4, 2020, and are extracted from the official website of the Italian Ministry of Health
(www.salute.gov.it). They include the overall national trend and five selected Italian regions: Emilia
Romagna, Lombardy, Marche, Tuscany, and Veneto. Marche and Tuscany belong to the centre of Italy,
while Emilia Romagna, Lombardy, and Veneto belong to the north of Italy. These regions have been chosen
because of their centrality in the Italian outbreak; in fact, they are characterized by the highest number of
COVID-2019 confirmed cases on April 4, 2020. Lombardy is the country’s leading region, with a mortality
rate of 17,62% and 49,118 confirmed cases, the 39.41% of the overall Italian cases, followed by Emilia
Romagna (16,540 cases), Veneto (10,824 cases), Tuscany (5,671 cases), and Marche (4,341).2
About 79.4% of COVID-2019 cases are concentrated in the north of the country. This clearly shows that
COVID-2019 has especially affected the north of the country.

Notes: author’s elaboration on Italian Ministry of Health data (www.salute.gov.it).3

The descriptive analysis of the overall and regional data shows that the new daily COVID-2019 confirmed
cases have increased approximately until the 37th-38th day since the start of the epidemic. Then, they have
It’s necessary to stress that Piemonte has registered 11,709 cases at the same date. However, I decided not to consider
this region in the analysis due to the presence of an outlier on April 4, 2020.

showed a decreasing trend, by suggesting a possible epidemic slowdown (Figure 1). I will try to analyse
this trend in the next section.

3. Method and Results
In the last few months an increasing body of literature has attempted to forecast the trend and the final size
of the COVID-2019 pandemic by using different approaches (Batista 2020; Benvenuto et al. 2020; Fanelli
and Piazza 2020; Giordano et al. 2020; Gupta and Pal 2020; Kumar et al. 2020; Read et al. 2020; Wu et al.
2020; Zhao et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020). The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model
is one of them (Benvenuto et al. 2020; Gupta and Pal 2020; Kumar et al. 2020). It could be considered one
of the more used prediction models for time series. In particular, it combines the regressive process and the
moving average, and it allows to predict a given time series by considering its own lags and lagged forecast
error. The optimal ARIMA model parameters have been chosen i) by using the Akaike’s information
criterion (AIC); ii) by investigating autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function
(PACF) of the residuals; and iii) by testing the common statistical assumptions about residuals.
Specifically, I follow the approach of He and Tao (2018), Wang et al. (2018), and Benvenuto et al. (2020).4
In first instance, I check if the Italian regional and national time series are stationary by using the
Augmented Dickey-Fuller (1981) (ADF) test and the modified ADF-GLS (or ERS) test for unit root
developed by Elliott, Rothenberg and Stock (1992).5 The tests (table 1) show that almost all variables have
a unit root and need to be transformed into a stationary process.
Then, I use Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and the mean absolute error (MAE)6 to identify ARIMA
lag order (p), degree of differencing (d), and order of moving average (q). The best parameters for ARIMA
models, according to AIC and MAE minimization, are reported in Table 2. They are the following: Emilia
Romagna (0, 2, 1), Marche (0, 2, 2), Lombardy (1, 2, 1), Tuscany (3, 2, 1), Veneto (0, 2, 2), and Italy (4, 2,
2).
Finally, I implement three different tests to perform diagnostic cheeks on the residuals: i) the Doornik and
Hansen (1994) test for normality; ii) the Engle’s (1982) Lagrange Multiplier test for the ARCH
(autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) effect; and iii) the Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation. All
tests allow to accept the null hypothesis of normality, homoskedasticity, and autocorrelation of the residuals
(Table 3).7
Table 4 reports the summary of the results of ARIMA models (Figure 2 to 7). The forecast algorithm seems
to indicate that the national new daily COVID-2019 cases are largely stabilized and will probably drop near
to zero (local cases) in the next 38 days, at least (Figure 2). The hypothetic inflection point8 will be reach
after May 12, 2020, at least. And the final epidemic size should be between 194,000 and 206,000 cases.9 A

(http://gretl.sourceforge.net/win32/index_it.html).
5
I use two different approaches because, as stated by Gujarati and Porter (2009), there is no a recognized uniformly
powerful test for detecting unit root.
6
According to Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018), MAE is one of the most commonly used scale-dependent
measures to assess the forecast accuracy. Moreover, as well as AIC, it’s very easy to interpret.
7
The only exceptions are Emilia Romagna and Lombardy, that are affected by non-normality and autocorrelation,
respectively. If the normality is not a necessary condition for forecasting, the violation of the independence assumption
may generate some problems.
8
I mean the inflection point of the cumulative number of COVID-2019 confirmed cases.
9
The epidemic final size is obtained by summing the original values until April 4, 2020, and the forecast values for
the period after April 4, 2020.

similar downward trend is obtained by fitting a specific ARIMA model for the single regions. Specifically,
Emilia Romagna requires 42 days to come closer to zero local new cases (Figure 3), Lombardy needs 32
days (Figure 4), Tuscany requires 56 days (Figure 6), and Veneto needs 28 days to significatively flatten
the COVID-2019 curve (Figure 7), at least. Marche needs only 12 days (Figure 5), but it does not seem a
conservative estimate. So, in Table 4 I report the average mean between the first and the second best
ARIMA model. It indicates that Marche needs on average 40 days to reach the hypothetic inflection point.
The absence of significant residual spikes in ACF and PACF correlograms, shows that all models are a
good fit (Figures A1, A2, and A3 in the Appendix).10
However, it’s important to stress that this is only a rough guide that requires other updated estimates to be
confirmed.

4. Conclusion
ARIMA models can be viewed as a simple and immediate tool to program the health monitoring
system at national and regional level. The main advantages of ARIMA forecasting approach are
surely its ease of application and interpretation. By the contrary, it is sensitive to outliers in the
data and, do not account for the noise, that is unknown by definition. For these reasons it may be
considered a good model for short-term forecasting, but the results should be interpreted with
thriftiness.
Results suggest that COVID-2019 epidemic in Italy will reach the plateau, in term of cumulative
cases, in the next 40-55 days, i.e. about the entire month of April and May 2020. Specifically,
Lombardy and Veneto seem to require a lower number of days than the other regions, especially
compared to Tuscany, that will need approximately 56 days to definitively flatten the COVID2019 curve. The final epidemic size in Italy should be around 200,000 cases. However, it is
necessary to stress that this rough estimation is strongly related to the previous values. The
continuation of the restrictive measures and the strict compliance with the rules, such as traffic and
travel restriction, ban on gatherings, and closure of commercial activities, may mitigate the size of
the epidemic.

Further useful and more precise forecasting may be provided by updating these data and applying
the model to other regions and countries.
