Abstract
Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have played a crucial role in controlling the spread of COVID-19.
Nevertheless, NPI efficacy varies enormously between and within countries, mainly because of population
and behavioral heterogeneity. In this work, we adapted a multi-group SEIRA model to study the spreading
dynamics of COVID-19 in Chile, representing geographically separated regions of the country by different
groups. We use national mobilization statistics to estimate the connectivity between regions and data from
governmental repositories to obtain COVID-19 spreading and death rates in each region. We then assessed the
effectiveness of different NPIs by studying the temporal evolution of the reproduction number Rt . Analyzing
data-driven and model-based estimates of Rt , we found a strong coupling of different regions, highlighting the
necessity of organized and coordinated actions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we evaluated
different scenarios to forecast the evolution of COVID-19 in the most densely populated regions, finding that
the early lifting of restriction probably will lead to novel outbreaks.

1. Introduction
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the seventh reported coronavirus
that can infect humans [7, 54]. As a consequence of the fast global spread and severe effects of the infectious
disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on
11 March 2020, resulting in 214 countries affected to date [46, 53]. After more than one year of living in a
pandemic world and despite scientific efforts, effective treatments for COVID-19 are not yet available. Even
though several countries are deploying vaccination plans worldwide, uncertainties related to vaccine efficacy

and uptake suggest the necessity of keeping non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in place for preventing
excess deaths and the emergence of escape variants [3, 15, 40].
Since the pandemic began, researchers have been proposing different epidemiological models to evaluate
and forecast the evolution of the disease. A significant part of those models derives from the renowned SIR
model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 [28], which compartmentalizes the population exposed
to the virus in the variables susceptible (S), infected (I) and Recovered (R), whose interaction determines the
evolution of the disease over time. Even though helpful, SIR models rely on several hypotheses that are rather
hard to meet [26], most of them related to homogeneity [50]. SIR models assume a "perfect mixing", where
individuals are equally likely to meet, and from a continuous perspective, fractions of them do all the time.
Individuals are assumed to have the same transition rates, translating to the same probability of being infected
and the same average time to recover. Furthermore, SIR models do not include a latent period, one of the
signature characteristics of COVID-19 [23]. Direct extensions of the SIR model include extra compartments
to represent variables of epidemiological interest, as SEIR models, differentiating exposed individuals that
are not yet infectious, SIRD, differentiating deaths, and SEIRA models, considering asymptomatic carriers,
among others [6, 13, 18, 20, 22, 31, 48, 51].
Viral spread depends not only on its biological properties but also on the behavior and susceptibility of
the population where it propagates [49]. Therefore, a more realistic analysis of the propagation of the disease
in a heterogeneous population usually requires models that include the interaction between the different
sub-populations [25, 26, 29]. These sub-populations interact dynamically with each other, and the spreading
modes are not necessarily isotropic [16]. Furthermore, our understanding of viral spread is greatly determined
by data availability and quality, which has been proven to have significant delays [11], weekly modulation
[19], and even weekend effects [5, 10].
The case of Chile is an example of countries where typical SIR models would not work; its geopolitical
centralization isolates and scatters the different regions that behave as independent populations with varying
rules of interaction [1, 11, 16]. Besides, the profound economic inequality as reported by the Gini’s index
of the world bank [52] among different social classes constitutes both physical and behavioral anisotropy
for the spread of COVID-19. Chile has 16 regions with non-homogeneous connectivity, represented in the
modeling by the interaction matrix (Φ), in which each module can be weighted. This matrix is not necessarily
symmetric, it considers the fractions of the communities that effectively interact, and it is modified by
the spreading rate (β) of each sub-population according to the restriction measures implemented by the
government to every community, representing the effective interaction in a given period.
In this work, we modified the multi-group SEIRA model presented in [16] to study the COVID-19 spreading
dynamics in Chile. We incorporate a compartment for the deaths and design a tailored parameter fitting
methodology to fit the parameters governing the dynamics. We incorporate real-world data for estimating
connectivity matrices and solve the inverse problem for parameter fitting using data from official sources.
2

We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs by studying how parameters evolved in the different epidemiological
periods. We also study the differences between data-driven and model-based estimates of the reproduction
number to evaluate whether the observed dynamics are driven by the local behavior or by the coupling with
other regions. By a Monte Carlo-inspired procedure [35], we estimated parameter variability and provided
a statistically-based forecast of the pandemic’s evolution in Chile. We also study three future scenarios
assuming different levels of social distancing, which allow us to predict the effect of the various health
policies implemented by the government; in consequence, authorities can take better decisions to prevent the
spreading [8].

2. Methodology
2.1. Overview
We detail the implementation workflow of the proposed SEIRD multi-group model in Figure 1. We first
collect and pre-process official data of the spread of COVID-19 in Chile from local authorities [39]. The
interaction and mobility data required for modeling the connectivity between the sixteen regions of Chile
is estimated from national statistics [41–43] and projections for 2020 [44]. We obtained default and initial
parameter values for the model from regional reports and literature. Then, we study the temporal evolution
of the spreading and death rate in each region, using a combination of the simulated annealing and gradient
descent algorithms to minimize the error existing between the reported (raw) and simulated curves. Finally,
using these values and based on different social distancing measures, various possible scenarios are presented
for active infected and deceased cases within an established temporal horizon.
2.1.1. Interaction dynamics between different regions
We summarize the interaction structure between the different sub-populations considered in the SEIRD
model in a connection matrix (Φ). In this matrix, entries (Φ)i,j represent the fraction of individuals from
the ith sub-population that moves to the jth. Note that Φ is not necessarily symmetric, as the flux of
individuals moving from i to j may be different from the ones from j moving to i. An example of this
situation is the migration to centralized regions, where a considerable fraction of individuals move to, but
there is no considerable migration in the other way around. Therefore, (Φ)i,j 6= (Φ)j,i . In our model, Φ
is also modulated by the local spreading rates βi , thereby including governmental restrictions valid in the
different periods considered.
For each region i, we estimated (Φ)i,j as the fraction of individuals over fifteen years old from i temporally
moving to j because of work or studies, based on national mobility data [41–44]. The displacement matrix Φ
comprises factors ei and Cij ; The value ei represents the fraction of the population that leaves the region,

On the other hand, Cij represents the fraction of those individuals leaving i that go to region j. Thus,
we can estimate (Φ)ij as:

Given the geographical characteristics of Chile and its centralization, Regions do not have the same level
of displacement between them (Table S2).
2.2. Model Description
2.2.1. Equations
In our model, i represents one of the sixteen regions of Chile, and we represent the spreading dynamics
of SARS-CoV-2 using differential equations in a SEIRD compartmental model where the temporal scale
4

is measured in days. Susceptible individuals Si can acquire the virus after an effective contagion from an
infected individual and would be moved to the exposed compartment Ei . There, they would spend, on
average, a time tc (latent period) until they become infectious Ii . After an average time ti (infectious period),
infectious individuals are moved to a final recover Ri or death Di compartment. The description, initial
values, and sources for all the parameters in equations from (1) to (5) are shown in Table 1.

2.3. Data treatment
Raw data presented corresponds to that reported daily by the Government of Chile, available in Ministry
of Science [39]. This work analyzed official data reported daily by the Government of Chile [36], consisting in
a total of 244 days until November the 2nd, 2020.
Regional-level daily data for each region i starts in March 3rd 2020 and include new daily infected cases,
total infected cases, and total deaths (Di ). However, due to a reporting inconsistency generated when the
5

official reporting guidelines changed (June 1st), datasets contained systematic errors. We corrected those
errors as explained in Supplementary Section 3. Using these corrected datasets (available as supplementary
dataset), we calculate total recovered (Ri ) and active infected cases (Ii ), defining also variables accounting
for the experimental time (Texp ) and number of inhabitants per region (nhab ).
For parameter fitting, we defined fifteen epidemiological periods for the pandemic progression in Chile,
which limits matched relevant governmental measures detailed in Table 2 [4, 30, 38].
2.4. Initial guess and nested problems
The set of initial values for the parameters (Supplementary Table S3) are expected to reflect the behavior
of the different population variables (SEIRD) in the different epidemiological periods, according to the
confinement measures established by the government in every region. We perform a separate parameter
fitting for every epidemiological period and could be extended to a higher number of periods, if necessary.
After obtaining the simulated curves for the SEIRD variables, using the values in Table S3, we define
which parameters will be estimated by the simulated annealing algorithm, before proceeding to the formal
parameter fitting. We considered the percentage of asymptomatic patients to be constant across regions, based
on governmental reports [36]. Recovery and exposure rates are considered uniform at the country level as the
Chilean health system have not been overwhelmed to date. Therefore, we obtain in the parameter fitting the
local spreading and death rates (βi and θi respectively). We also provide freedom to the initial conditions of
the first epidemiological period, leaving them to be determined in the parameter fitting procedure.
We numerically obtain the solution of the SEIRD model (equations (1)–(5)) for every parameter combination evaluated throughout the fitting process. Subsequently, we quantify a measure proportional to the mean
squared error (MSE) between simulated curves and raw data reported for each region, combined in the cost
functional J k being minimized in the k’th epidemiological period. The optimization algorithm selected was a
combination of simulated annealing and gradient descent.
Finally, the initial guess for initial condition of the SEIRD variables in each region was defined as
follows: the initial value for the number of susceptible (Si (0)) people is considered as the total population
of the region, while Ei (0) = Ii (0) = Ri (0) = Di (0) = 0, except in Maule Region, where IMaule (0) = 1 and
SMaule (0) = nhab − 1 because this region was where the first COVID-19 case in Chile was reported.
2.5. Parameter fitting strategy: Resolution of inverse problem
We determined the set of parameters that best describes the observed national dynamics (with regional
resolution) by minimizing a cost functional J k for each of the k epidemiological periods Tk = [tki , tkf ] as
described in Table 2. This functional accounts for the total MSE (mean squared error) between the number of
infected I, deaths D, and recovered R cases and raw data obtained from official repositories [36]. Structurally,

Because of differences in the number of inhabitants across regions, without explicitly correcting it, the
error contributed by a small region will be less than that contributed by a large region. To avoid unrealistic
solutions where small regions would be left aside because of the algorithm’s blind drive to minimize the error,
i,k
we included a weighting factor. Each contribution of each region was weighted by wX
, a factor directly

proportional to the ratio between the total infected, recovered or deceased calculated cases for the all country
in the last day of the epidemiological period, and the respective number of infected, recovered or deceased
calculated cases in the i region the same day.

where the 1.7 exponent in wX
was empirically set for balancing the contributions of large and small regions,

and the correction factor wX connects the different contributions in functional JX . Given the difference in
magnitude of deceased in comparison with active infected and recovered cases we define wI = wR = 1 and
wD = 102 .
We then find the optimal parameters for the fit as the argument of a minimization problem, numerically
minimizing value of Jk for each epidemiological period. Noteworthy, each epidemiological period described
in Table 2 has at least 14 data points ranging in times [tki , tkf ] corresponding to daily levels of infection,
recoveries, and deaths, thus constituting for each region (and per period) a total of 42 independent measures.
On the other hand, we only have to fit two parameters per region and per epidemiological period (namely,
βik and θik ), thus not risking overfitting.
The implementation of the mathematical model and resolution of the parameter-fitting inverse problem
was performed in Matlab version R2018a.
2.6. Variability assessment and forecasting
To obtain reliable values for the selected parameters, Monte Carlo simulations [35] were performed
according to the methodology described in Contreras et al. [14] (N = 450). In these simulations, we induce a
±5% white noise in the input data, and fit the parameters using this mildly noisy signal. Doing so, we aim
to minimize the contribution of potential errors underlying the data. In that way, this experiment is also a
sensitivity analysis of the method to the data. The inverse problem for curve-fitting is solved individually,
resulting in distributions of parameters. We statistically obtained average population parameters and their
variability from those distributions.
8

Once obtaining values for both parameters and their uncertainty, we evaluate different forecast scenarios
for the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic Chile.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Monte Carlo simulations
As a result of Monte Carlo multiple-simulations experiment performed we obtained distributions for both
βi and θi parameters in each region, and subsequently used them to numerically solve our model. Here we
focus on active infected cases (I) and total deaths (D), since these we believe are of greater importance for
policymakers.
Tables 3 and 4 show the median values obtained for β and θ, respectively, with a 95% confidence interval
in the Metropolitan, Valparaíso and Bío-Bío Regions in each epidemiological period. Noteworthy, these
regions concentrate the largest number of inhabitants in the northern, central, and southern zones of the
country, adding up to almost 60% of the total population of Chile. We observe that the highest values
of β were in the first epidemiological period, where no social distancing measures had been established,
followed by the IV epidemiological period, for Metropolitan, Valparaíso, and Bío-Bío Regions — which was
approximately three weeks after the government announced “safe return to work” or “the new normality”
in the Metropolitan Region —. We observe a change point in the general population behavior after the
announcement, which was delayed to the IV epidemiological period because of the disease timeline (latency,
incubation, recovery time) and significant delays in testing [11]. A higher rate of infections subsequently
spread from Metropolitan Region to the regions with the highest rate of transfers: Valparaíso and Bío-Bío.
In each epidemiological period, βi values do not present a high variability, which is reflected in the narrow
95% confidence intervals. The periods in which there is a higher variability correspond to those with higher
β values, so the number of infections was triggered and the fitting becomes more challenging.
These analyses are extended to each of the 13 remaining regions of the country, reporting median values
of βi and θi (i = 1...16) for each region and epidemiological period (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). Raw
data (parameter values for each realization of the Monte Carlo simulation) for all regions and epidemiological
periods are reported as separate Supplementary Files for β and θ. The death rate θi should not be mistaken
by the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR), as the latter represents the fraction of individuals who die after being
infected. If we focus on the infectious compartment Ii , the transitions rates to recovery or death are given
by γ and θi , being γ = 1/14 at least one order of magnitude larger than θi (cf. Table 4). Estimating the
IFR as

θi
γ+θi ,

and using the inferred values of theta for all epidemiological periods and regions, we obtain a

median IFR of 1.56 %, which agrees well with official data [24]. A more detailed analysis is provided in the
Supplementary Materials, Section S4.

The NPI (non-pharmaceutical interventions) agenda of the government was different for each region, and
the main criterion for enacting them was the reported new cases. We observe that the spreading rate β
remained high in some regions during the first epidemiological periods before decreasing, due to the time
required for evidencing the effects of lockdowns and delays associated with the disease progression. In those
regions reporting the first COVID-19 cases in Chile, the spreading rate β decreased faster because of the
earlier establishment of NPIs. An example is the O’Higgins Region, which has the lowest average value for
the fifteen epidemiological periods of spreading rate. Regarding the death rate θ, it remained relatively low
in all regions since the hospital capacity at the country level for the correct care of critical patients was not
exceeded, and also due to the efficiency in the inter-regional transfer of patients.

3.2. COVID-19 regional spreading dynamics
Using the different sets of parameters obtained in the Monte Carlo experiment, the simulated curves for
the active infected cases (I) and deaths cases (D) are projected in each region over time with a two-level
calculated confidence interval (60% and 95%). Figure 2 shows both the simulations and raw data for the
Metropolitan, Valparaíso, and Bío-Bío Regions.
We observe that simulated curves are in good agreement with raw data, which always remain within the
confidence intervals and present consistent trends. The color intensity of these zones varies depending on the
confidence intervals percentage (95% and 60%, light and dark shadows, respectively), calculated from the β
and θ distributions obtained in the Monte Carlo experiment.
We observe a peak in the active cases in the Metropolitan Region between June and July, which corresponds

Figure 2: Simulated curves of active infected (top) and deceased (bottom) cases for the Valparaíso (A,B), Metropolitan (C,D)
and Bío-Bío (E,F) Regions, along with 60% and 95% confidence intervals. Raw data for the evaluated time-frame is also
presented (grey dots).

to an increase in the number of deaths cases on the same period. Raw data for the active infected cases in the
Valparaíso and Bío-Bío Regions has two peaks. The first one corresponds to the date where active cases in the
Metropolitan Region were at their peak, so due to the high number of transfers between these regions, these
active cases act as vectors of infection in the destination regions, thus increasing infected cases and therefore
deceased. In contrast, the second one is related to the fact that the measures adopted by the government are
sectorized for each Region. For Valparaíso and Bío-Bío Regions, the isolation measures were relaxed before
than for the Metropolitan Region, resulting in a second increase rate of the active infected cases. Curves for
the other regions are presented in the supplementary material (Figure 1 to Figure 13, Supplementary). As
the time-frame set for each epidemiological period does not necessarily match the temporality of the different
measures enacted in each region, some parts of the raw data drift from the median in certain epidemiological
periods. Thus, it is crucial to consider the actual spreading dynamics between geographical Regions to
represent more appropriately the scenario in each Region. This could also be solved by further reducing the
number of days per period but risking the possibility of overfitting to raw data.
The proposed SEIRD model was able to adjust well to the data in both low-population and heavily
populated regions, showing the relevance of the 1.7 factor described in the parameter fitting strategy section.
Higher values for this adjustment factor result in a better adjustment in the small regions, but at the cost of
a less rigorous adjustment in the larger regions. In contrast, with values lower than 1.7, the opposite occurs.
In Figure 3, we present the results of a sensitivity analysis of the fitted set to perturbations of (±20%) in the
12

parameters obtained in for last epidemiological period.

Figure 3: Sensitivity analysis for the last epidemiological period. The red scale represents the variations in β values, from the
first region (red) to the last (yellow), while the blue scale represents the variations in θ values, from the first region (blue) to the
last one (cyan).

We observe that, when making these variations in each of the 32 parameters obtained (16 β and 16 θ)
the calculated error increases, thus confirming that the parameters obtained by solving the inverse problem
effectively minimize the error existing between the simulated curves and the experimental ones.
3.3. On the values of Rt in coordinated government measures
The Effective Reproduction Number Rt represents the number of persons a single infected individual
might infect, in a population that is aware of the disease representing the viral spread rate of the virus, and
varies depending on the policies implemented by the government, such as quarantines [47]. Based on the
parameters obtained from the simulations, it is possible to calculate the value of Rt as the ratio between
the spreading rate β and the recovery plus deaths rate (γ + θ), as demonstrated in Cintrón-Arias et al. [9].
This approach allows us to obtain the effective reproduction number driven only by the local population’s

13

behavior, decoupled from other regions:
Rt =

βi
.
θ i + γi

(11)

We obtain a data-driven value for the observed Rt , Rtobs , adapting the methodology presented in Contreras
et al. [17], Medina-Ortiz et al. [34]:
Rtobs =

∆I
+1
∆R + ∆D

(12)

In particular, both values do not necessarily need a match, as they represent -slightly- different quantities.
The observed Rtobs represents whether the overall trend is the spread or containment of the disease, purely
driven by data, and is affected by testing and tracing governmental plans [12]. More extensive testing will
uncover unnoticed infection chains, and also increase the numbers as the uncovering would be faster than the
spread of the disease. On the other hand, the effective reproduction number Rt accounts for local trends on
contagion, disregarding whether those cases would be noticed or remain uncovered throughout the disease
timeline.
In Figure 4 the Rt values obtained from official sources and simulation results in the Metropolitan,
Valparaíso, and Bío-Bío Regions are presented, in conjunction with an 95% confidence interval. As is shown,
both Rt values reflect a similar behavior. However, they are not identical, probably because there is a
difference between the simulated and raw data due to the contribution of the inter-region movements in the
infection rate, which agrees with the results obtained in the inverse problem-solving.

Figure 4: Rt values calculated from raw data (red) and simulated data (blue) for the Valparaíso (A), Metropolitan (B) and
Bío-Bío (C) Regions with 60% and 95% confidence interval.

These results for Rt show the correlation between the imposed social distancing measures and the values
of the Effective Reproduction Number, in the different regions. This value is higher in the III epidemiological
14

period for the three presented regions and subsequently decreases as more restrictive measures are declared.
The case of the Magallanes region (Figure 26, Supplementary Material) is of particular interest, in the absence
of proper coordination around social distancing measures, a high Rt number is observed in mid-August and
consequently a second outbreak of infected assets, more significant than the first one.
Projecting these Rt values into the future, a decrease in the virus spreading rate and a reduction of the
number of active infected would be expected, since a Rt < 1 implies a slow rate of spread and the outbreak
size would decay exponentially.
3.4. Model Forecasting
To evaluate the impact of governmental interventions, we simulated different scenarios aiming to project
the contagion trends observed if those interventions did not take place. In Figure 5, we present projections
of infected cases in the Metropolitan Region, if no more restrictions were imposed after the II and III
epidemiological periods.

Figure 5: Different simulated scenarios for active infected cases in the Metropolitan Region. A: Scenario I (cyan
curve) corresponds to establishing a total quarantine from the first epidemiological period. In contrast, scenarios II (orange
curve) and III (purple curve) represent the cases where no greater measures of social distancing took place as of periods II and
III, respectively. The vertical dashed red lines indicate the date of periods I, II and III. Figures B and C correspond to different
scales from figure A to visualize the scope of the curves.

Due to the importance of establishing containment measures as soon as possible to avoid an excessive
spread of the virus, the first three epidemiological periods were chosen to evaluate immediate quarantine (I)
and non-imposition of measures (II and III) scenarios.
It is observed that in the scenario I the number of active infected cases reaches a peak of approximately
1500 (Figure 5, C) cases, 30 days after the first reported case. The spreading rate (β) (Table 3) associated
15

with this scenario corresponds to 0.05, registered in the VII epidemiological period in which the metropolitan
region was in total quarantine. On the other hand, in scenarios II and III active infections peak over a
million cases between days 150 - 200 (Figure 5, B). Scenario III is the one that presents a higher number of
infections due mainly to two factors: the number of active infected cases at the beginning of the period and
the spreading rate. In both factors, the values are higher in the third period than in the second. In addition
to the spreading rate (β) (Table 3) in the third period being 0.29, while in the second period it is 0.14, a
higher initial number of actively infected would facilitate the spread of the virus in the presence of a high
spreading rate, explaining the behavior of the scenario II and III curves.
Using the same strategy, we analyzed different future scenarios based on the projected restrictions for each
region. On July 19th, the Government of Chile announced the beginning of the "Step by Step" plan to lift the
current social distancing measures gradually. This plan involved the gradual opening in the different districts
and regions of the country based on the contagion rate present in each one, the percentage of occupancy of
ICU (intensive care unit) beds in hospitals, and the rate of PCR test positivity, among others. The steps are:
1. Quarantine: People cannot leave their homes.
2. Transition: People is allowed to leave the house with restrictions, only on weekdays.
3. Preparation: Individuals are free to move, but group gatherings are not permitted.
4. Initial Opening: Group gatherings are permitted, with a restricted number of people.
5. Advanced Opening: free group gatherings are permitted.
Each region that enters a new stage of the plan presents greater freedom of movement and, therefore,
the number and intensity of contacts between people (and thereby the spreading rate β) could increase.
Consequently, a weighting factor is assigned to each stage of the plan. This factor multiplies the β value of the
corresponding region to projecting the effects that the "Step by Step" program will have on the extrapolation
in the SEIRD variables (Table S6) [21].
Figure 6 present three different scenarios projected for the Metropolitan Region. These scenarios are
projected in a time window until the end of 2020:
• Scenario 1: The Metropolitan Region remain in stage 1 of quarantine.
• Scenario 2: Current scenario. The Metropolitan Region advances to 4th phase of preparation.
• Scenario 3: Limit scenario, in which the spreading rate β increases to such an extent that large
outbreaks and the second wave of massive infections occur.
Based on the projections, we would expect a sustained decrease in case numbers if the quarantined regime
continues. However, in the current scenario (initial opening phase), a second peak in contagion is expected.
Nevertheless, this wave would be lower in magnitude compared with the one observed in the first half of

Figure 6: Different scenarios proposed for the Metropolitan Region. The first scenario (A) represents the evolution of the active
infected (top) and death (bottom) cases maintaining a lockdown from November 2nd (vertical red line) until the end of 2020,
while the second (B) and third scenario (C) represent the current situation and a massive reopening respectively.

2020, and therefore the health system would also be able to handle it. Finally, in the third scenario (where a
massive opening is proposed), we observe a more pronounced increase in case numbers, which will eventually
exceed the number of infections observed at the beginning of the pandemic. Noteworthy, this is more or less
the current (March 2021) national trend (see, e.g. [53]). In this scenario, it would be uncertain to predict
occupancy levels of ICU beds in hospitals as well as requests for mechanical respirators. Nonetheless, we
would expect a saturation of the public health system.

4. Conclusions
COVID-19 spreading dynamics depends on multiple factors, including the biological/epidemiological
aspects of SARS-CoV-2, human behavior, governmental interventions, and heterogeneities among the affected
population. Several research groups have statistically analyzed these factors during pandemic progression, and
we carefully included them in our modelling. The multi-group SEIRD model used considers the heterogeneous
distribution and dynamic displacement of the Chilean population, grouped in 16 regions, and also a timeline
of the different NPIs enacted by the government.
Following the presented results, our model shows to be efficient to the adjustment of the raw data,
17

overcoming challenges as discontinuities and high variability in it, generating simulations that are easy
to interpret and project with narrow confidence intervals. The measures imposed for a particular region
can affect other regions, to a greater or lesser extent depending on their interaction, thus highlighting the
need for coordinated governmental actions to control the spread of COVID-19. We have shown that the
multi-group SEIRD model presented in this work is a useful tool to represent the contribution of each region
in a heterogeneously populated country and is helpful to forecast in the short term the evolution of the
different population groups.
