Abstract
Tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations are strongly affected by anthropogenic
activities. Using space-based measurements of tropospheric NO2, here we investigate the
responses of tropospheric NO2 to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) over China, South Korea,
and Italy. We find noticeable reductions of tropospheric NO2 columns due to the COVID-19
controls by more than 40% over E. China, South Korea, and N. Italy. The 40% reductions of
tropospheric NO2 are coincident with intensive lockdown events as well as up to 20% reductions
in anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. The perturbations in tropospheric NO2
diminished accompanied with the mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic, and finally disappeared
within around 50-70 days after the starts of control measures over all three nations, providing
indications for the start, maximum, and mitigation of intensive controls. This work exhibits
significant influences of lockdown measures on atmospheric environment, highlighting the
importance of satellite observations to monitor anthropogenic activity changes.

Introduction
The COVID-19 has become a severe threat to global public health since it was initially
reported in January 2020 (Zhu et al. 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared
COVID-19 as a global pandemic on Mar 11 2020, because of the rapid spread across the world:
the reported confirmed cases are about 6400 thousand globally with 380 thousand deaths by
June 1 2020 (http://www.chinacdc.cn). An important reason of the global outbreak of COVID-19
is lacking specific antiviral therapies and vaccines, and thus, the control strategy depends on
isolation of cases and contact tracing to reduce the transmission rate (Chinazzi et al. 2020, Li et
al. 2020), which has resulted in unprecedented lockdowns across the world.
As a precursor to ozone and secondary aerosols, NO2 is one of the most important
pollutants and plays a key role in tropospheric chemistry. Tropospheric NO2 concentrations are
strongly affected by fossil fuel combustions, such as power generation, industrial and
transportation emissions (Jiang et al. 2018). The short lifetime of tropospheric NO2 (few hours at
the surface) makes it an ideal tracer for local anthropogenic emissions, as it exhibits marked
responses to perturbations in economic activities (Mijling et al. 2009, Wang et al. 2015, Tong et
al. 2016). The economic activity changes, due to the intensive lockdowns to mitigate the COVID19, are expected to affect tropospheric NO2 (Zhang et al. 2020), however, their actual influences
are still uncertain, e.g., the “flawed estimates of the effects of lockdown measures on air quality
derived from satellite observations” as suggested by the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF 2020).
An important task of the international community, in 2020, is to understand the impacts of
anthropogenic activity changes due to COVID-19 controls on atmospheric environment. In this

2

work, we investigate the responses of tropospheric NO2 to COVID-19 control measures over
China, South Korea, and Italy to analyze the influence of lockdown measures on tropospheric NO2,
particularly, the responses of tropospheric NO2 to the pandemic developments (i.e., start,
maximum, and mitigation of pandemic spreads).

Results
Responses of tropospheric NO2 to COVID-19
Figure 1a shows tropospheric NO2 columns (OMI-QA4ECV, Boersma et al. 2018, See SI)
over E. China, normalized in the 50-10 days before Jan 25 2020 (Spring Festival in 2020). The data
over China are shifted for 2015-2019 to account for the economic cycles due to the Spring Festival.
The reference time (RT, Table 1) is set to Jan 25 for the following two reasons: 1) the Spring
Festival is a good indication for Chinese economic cycles; 2) tropospheric NO2 in the 50-10 days
before Jan 25 were not affected by COVID-19 (Figure 1b). Figures 1c-d and Figures 1e-f show
tropospheric NO2 and daily new confirmed cases over South Korea and N. Italy, respectively. The
tropospheric NO2 over South Korea is normalized in the 50-10 days before Feb 23 (RT, about 200
daily new confirmed cases). Considering the comparable populations between South Korea
(about 50 million) and Italy (about 60 million), the tropospheric NO2 over N. Italy is normalized in
the 50-10 days before Feb 28 (RT, about 200 daily new confirmed cases) to ensure tropospheric
NO2 in the 50-10 days before the RTs were not affected by COVID-19 (Figures 1d, 1f).
As shown in Figure 1, the normalized tropospheric NO2 changes (2020 vs. 2015-2019)
exhibit the following relations with the COVID-19 pandemic developments:
1) Agreements in tropospheric NO2 before the pandemic outbreaks: 50-0 days before the
RT for E. China; 50-10 days before the RTs for South Korea and N. Italy.

3

2) Agreements in tropospheric NO2 with pandemic mitigation: 60-80 days after the RT for
E. China; 40-80 days after the RT for South Korea; 50-70 days after the RT for N. Italy.
3) Large differences in tropospheric NO2 by more than 40%, coincident with the pandemic
outbreaks.
Figure 2 shows the distributions of tropospheric OMI NO2 columns over these three nations.
Consistent with Figure 1, we find marked reductions of tropospheric NO 2 in the 10-30 days after
the RTs over E. China, South Korea, and N. Italy in 2020. The reductions of tropospheric NO2 are
widely observable over these three nations.
Furthermore, the difference between tropospheric NO2 in 2020 and 2015-2019 increased on
the RT for E. China, but in about 10 days before the RTs for South Korea and N. Italy, suggesting
a 10-day delay in the response of tropospheric NO2 to the pandemic development in China
compared to in South Korea and Italy. The delayed response in China could be due to the strong
inhibition of the Spring Festival on Chinese economic activities, e.g., the E. China-averaged
tropospheric NO2 dropped by about 50% within 10 days prior to the national holiday (Figure 1a),
which is even stronger than the perturbation due to COVID-19 controls. The perturbation in
tropospheric NO2 in the initial pandemic stage in China may have been covered by the inhibition
due to the Spring Festival.
Limited influences from non-anthropogenic processes
We have demonstrated large perturbations in tropospheric NO2 by more than 40%
accompanied with the outbreaks of COVID-19. However, it is still unclear whether the
perturbations were caused by anthropogenic or non-anthropogenic processes (e.g., large-scale
anomaly in meteorological conditions). Figures 3a-c show modeled tropospheric NO2 columns

4

over these three nations, driven with the MIROC-Chem chemical transport model (See SI) and
fixed anthropogenic NOx emissions in 2017. The meteorological fields are ERA-Interim with
1.125°x1.125° horizontal resolution. Considering the local equator crossing time (13:45) of OMI
instrument, we only consider tropospheric NO2 in 12:00-15:00 local time (Shen et al. 2019). The
modeled tropospheric NO2 are generally within the ±20% range of the 2015-2019 averages
(shaded areas), with good agreement between 2020 (red) and 2015-2019 (blue).
Similarly, Figures 3d-f show modeled tropospheric NO2 columns from the GEOS-Chem
chemical transport model (See SI) and fixed anthropogenic NOx emissions in 2017. The
meteorological fields are MERRA-2 with 2°x2.5° horizontal resolution. The modeled tropospheric
NO2 with GEOS-Chem are generally within the ±20% (E. China and South Korea) and ±30% (N.
Italy) ranges of the 2015-2019 averages, with good agreement between 2020 and 2015-2019.
Furthermore, Figures 3g-i show tropospheric OMI NO2 columns. The observed tropospheric OMI
NO2 are generally within the ±20% range of the 2015-2019 averages, however, with significant
discrepancy between 2020 and 2015-2019. The agreements between modeled and observed
tropospheric NO2 in Figure 3 suggest that the non-anthropogenic processes have limited
influences on the observed NO2 changes: about 20% for E. China and South Korea, and 20-30%
for N. Italy, providing estimations for the uncertainties in the observed OMI NO2 (Table 1).
The distributions of tropospheric OMI NO2 in the 2015-2019 (Figures 3g-i) are shown in
Figure 1 as the shaded areas. It demonstrates the deviations (larger than 40%) as well as the
recovery of tropospheric NO2 are caused by changes in anthropogenic NOx emissions. In addition,
we find the trends in tropospheric NO2 over N. Italy are almost the same in the 40-day period (RT
to 40 days after the RT, Figure 1e) between 2015-2019 and 2020. It is thus, difficult to distinguish

5

the changes in tropospheric NO2 due to COVID-19 controls and climatological projections with
simple comparison, as suggested by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
(ECMWF 2020).
Impacts of lockdowns on atmospheric environment
The above analysis indicates the important influences of anthropogenic activities on the
observed tropospheric NO2 changes. As shown in Table 1, the differences between tropospheric
NO2 in 2020 and 2015-2019 are larger than 40% in more than 17 days over E. China, South Korea,
and N. Italy. Here we further investigate the relations between changes in tropospheric NO2 and
lockdown measures:
1) China: lockdowns in provinces outside of Hubei since around Jan 31, 2020 (#1, Wiki
2020). Considering the inhibition of the Spring Festival on Chinese economic activities,
the lockdown measure (#1, Figure 1a) matches well with the start of the 40%
perturbation in tropospheric NO2.
2) South Korea: maximum quarantine in Gyeongsangbuk-Do (the province that COVID-19
was initially outbreak in South Korea) on Feb 25 2020 (#2, YNA 2020). As shown in Figure
1c, the quarantine (#2) matches well with the start of the 40% perturbation in
tropospheric NO2.
3) Italy: lockdown in N. Italy on Mar 7 2020 (#3, BBC 2020); all unnecessary commercial
activities stopped on Mar 11 (#4, Repubblica 2020). As shown in Figure 1e, these
lockdown measures (#3 and #4) match well with the start of the 40% perturbation in
tropospheric NO2.
The coincidences among the intensive lockdown measures, the 40% perturbations in

6

tropospheric NO2 and the mitigation of the pandemic demonstrate the influences of lockdown
measures on atmospheric environment and pandemic developments. The recovery of
tropospheric NO2 around 40-60 days after the RTs provides indications for the mitigation of
intensive controls.
Finally, we evaluate the impacts of lockdown measures on anthropogenic NOx emissions.
Following Miyazaki et al. (2020), we constrain anthropogenic NOx emissions with an ensemble
Kalman Filter (EnKF) while improving the representation of the chemical system (e.g., NO x
lifetime) by assimilating multiple chemical species (See SI). The combined total (anthropogenic,
soil, and lightning) emission is optimized in data assimilation with 1.125°x1.125° horizontal
resolution. As shown in Figure 4, we find:
1) Agreements in anthropogenic NOx emissions before the pandemic outbreaks: 50-0 days
before the RTs for E. China, South Korea, and N. Italy.
2) Differences in anthropogenic NOx emissions by up to 20%, coincident with the
pandemic outbreaks over all three nations.
The similar responses of OMI NO2 and derived anthropogenic NOx emissions to the pandemic
outbreaks provide support to our conclusion. The relative uncertainties in the derived NOx
emissions are larger than those in OMI NO2. It could be partially associated with the regionspecific data filters (Figure S1, See SI), which were not considered in the global assimilation. In
addition, the perturbations in OMI NO2 will become about 30% without the region-specific data
filters (Figure S2, See SI), implying a ratio of 0.7 between changes in NOx emissions and
tropospheric NO2 columns, consistent with the reported non-linear relationship (Lamsal et al.
2011; Gu et al. 2016).

Using space-based measurements, this work exhibits important impacts of COVID-19
control measures on atmospheric environment: tropospheric NO2 columns were reduced by 40%,
and with up to 20% reductions in anthropogenic NOx emissions over E. China, South Korea, and
N. Italy. More efforts are required to better understanding the worldwide responses of primary
atmospheric pollutants to the lockdown measures, as they provide important information for the
impacts of anthropogenic activities on atmospheric environment. In addition, the satellite data
provides indications for the start (about 10 days before the RTs), maximum (about 10-20 days
after the RTs), and mitigation (about 40-60 days after the RTs) of intensive COVID-19 controls,
highlighting the importance of satellite observations, as a powerful tool, to monitor
anthropogenic activity changes.

Supplemental Information
Tropospheric OMI NO2 column data
The OMI instrument on the Aura spacecraft has a spatial resolution of 13 km x 24 km (nadir
view), which is in a sun-synchronous ascending polar orbit with a local equator crossing time
of 13:45. OMI provides global coverage with measurements of both direct and atmospherebackscattered sunlight in the ultraviolet-visible range from 270 to 500 nm; the spectral range
405-465 nm is used to retrieve tropospheric NO2 columns. The OMI retrievals (level 2, QA4ECV,
Boersma et al. 2018) are used in this work. Following Jiang et al. (2018), and the QA4ECV
Product User Manual (http://www.qa4ecv.eu/ecv/no2-pre/data), the following filters are
applied in our analysis:
1) Tropospheric Column Flag = 0
2) Surface Albedo < 0.3
3) Cloud Radiance Fraction < 0.5
4) No edge data (rows 1-5, 56-60)
5) No row anomaly data (rows 27-55 for the period 2015-2020)

Figure S1. y-axis: regional daily average of tropospheric OMI NO2 columns; x-axis: regional
average of tropospheric OMI NO2 columns in the period of ± 15 days by excluding the current
day.
Besides the aforementioned filters, the regional averaged OMI NO2 data are affected by the
different daily coverage of satellite data. Figure S1 shows the relations between daily average
of tropospheric OMI NO2 and the average of its neighbouring days (± 15 days without the
current day). Large deviation from the 1:1 relationship means the daily average of OMI NO 2
17

is pronounced higher (or lower) than its neighbouring days. The following region-specific
filters (green lines in Figure S1) are supplemented in our analysis:
6) E. China: 0.35x < y < 2.7x
7) Korea: 0.4x < y < 2.2x
8) N. Italy: 0.4x < y < 2.2x

Figures S2a-c show tropospheric OMI NO2 columns in 2015-2020. The observed tropospheric
OMI NO2 are generally within the ±30% range of the 2015-2019 averages (shaded areas). The
application of the region-specific quality filters reduced the random uncertainties from ±30%
to ±20% (Figures S2d-f), while keeping the consistent patterns in the normalized NO2 (Figures

molec/cm2) in 2015-2020, normalized in the 50-10 days before the reference times (magenta
lines): Jan 25 (China), Feb 23 (Korea) and Feb 28 (Italy). The shaded areas show the ranges of
±30% (panels a-c) and ±20% (panels d-f) of the 2015-2019 averages. The solid and dashed
lines in panels e-i show tropospheric OMI NO2 columns with and without the region-specific
filters.
MIROC-Chem model simulations: The MIROC-Chem chemical transport model (Watanabe et
al., 2011) with 1.125°x1.125° horizontal resolution for 2014-2020 are used in this work. The
anthropogenic emissions were fixed in 2017. The model considers detailed photochemistry in
18

the troposphere and stratosphere and is coupled to the atmospheric general circulation
model MIROC-AGCM version 4 (Watanabe et al., 2011). The meteorological fields simulated
by MIROC-AGCM were nudged toward the six-hourly ERA-Interim (Dee et al., 2011). The
MIROC-Chem model has been widerly used in global atmospheric chemistry studies (Jiang et
al. 2018; Miyazaki et al. 2017; Miyazaki et al. 2020).
GEOS-Chem model simulations: The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (www.geoschem.org, version 11) with 2°x2.5° horizontal resolution for 2014-2020 are used in this work.
The anthropogenic emissions were fixed in 2017. The standard GEOS-Chem chemical
mechanism includes 68 tracers, which can simulate detailed tropospheric O3-NOxhydrocarbon chemistry, including the radiative and heterogeneous effects of aerosols. The
model is driven by assimilated meteorological fields from the Modern-Era Retrospective
analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2).

Derived anthropogenic NOx emission estimates: Based on an ensemble Kalman filter
technique, Miyazaki et al. (2017) estimated global surface NOx emissions for the period of
2005-2015 by assimilating multiple satellite data sets. Using the OMI QA4ECV NO2 products
(Boersma et al. 2018), updated emission estimates with 1.125°x1.125° horizontal resolution
for 2014-2020 are used in this work. The combined total (anthropogenic, soil, and lightning)
emission is optimized in data assimilation. This is to avoid the difficulty associated with
optimizing the spatiotemporal structure in background errors for each category source
separately. In our analysis, individual emission sources were estimated using the emission
ratio between different categories in the a priori emission inventories. The forecast model is
MIROC-Chem (Watanabe et al., 2011).
COVID-19 daily new confirmed case data: The COVID-19 confirmed case data is downloaded
at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention network (http://www.chinacdc.cn/),
in which the data is provided by the National Health Commission (NHC) and the World
Health Organization(WHO). As shown in Figure S3, the data from the NHC/WHO is consistent
but

smoother

than

the

from

Johns

University

(https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48
e9ecf6). The NHC (Hubei province, China) changed the testing methods on Feb 12 2020 by
19

considering patients who have been clinically diagnosed as COVID-19 disease as confirmed
cases. The cumulative number of clinically diagnosed patients was reported as daily new
confirmed cases on Feb 12 2020, which resulted in a jump by 14840.
