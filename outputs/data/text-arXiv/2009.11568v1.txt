Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 14.5 million infections and 6,04,917 deaths in 212
countries over the last few months. Different drug intervention acting at multiple stages of pathogenesis of
COVID-19 can substantially reduce the infection induced,thereby decreasing the mortality. Also population
level control strategies can reduce the spread of the COVID-19 substantially. Motivated by these observations, in this work we propose and study a multi scale model linking both within-host and between-host
dynamics of COVID-19. Initially the natural history dealing with the disease dynamics is studied. Later,
comparative effectiveness is performed to understand the efficacy of both the within-host and population
level interventions. Findings of this study suggest that a combined strategy involving treatment with drugs
such as Arbidol, remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir that inhibits viral replication and immunotherapies like
monoclonal antibodies, along with environmental hygiene and generalized social distancing proved to be the
best and optimal in reducing the basic reproduction number and environmental spread of the virus at the
population level.

The pandemic COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, spread its tentacles through out the world by taking
lives of 6,04,917 people and livelihood of many more across the globe. Research communities across the world
are racing against time in contributing their piece of knowledge in tackling this virus [1].
Mathematical models play a crucial role in this journey as they are helpful in multi-fold. Firstly, they
help in Understanding the dynamics of infection and its spread in the society. They help in studying the
success of various control measures that can be implemented in order to avoid further damage. Secondly, the
within-host mathematical modeling helps to study the dynamics of virus in the human body and can help us
in understanding efficacy of different drug intervention acting at multiple stages of pathogenesis which in turn
can help in identification of potential vaccine candidates. Some of the works dealing with population level
studies and within-host studies for diseases such as Dengue, HIV, Influenza include [4, 11, 3] and references
within. Recent works dealing with population level studies and within-host studies for COVID-19 can be found
in [5, 6, 7, 8, 10]
In addition to these, there are multi scale models linking within-host and between-host population scales
which helps us understand not only the efficacy of the intervention at individual level but also the effectiveness
at the population level. Broadly there are five different categories of multi scale models. As enlisted in [4], they
are Individual-based multi scale model, nested multi scale model, embedded multi scale model, hybrid multi
scale model and coupled multi scale model. Few works involving multi scale modeling approaches for diseases
include [4, 12]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work dealing with multi scale modeling approach for
Covid-19.
Motivated by the above in this study, we propose and study a nested multi scale model. Using the technique
of comparative effectiveness we study the efficacy of drug interventions at individual level and population level
1

control measures. The multi scale model and the corresponding interventions study which is being attempted
here is the first of its kind for Covid-19.

The Multi Scale Model Formulation

The multi scale model for COVID-19 disease dynamics across two scales that are within-host and between-host.
The model consists of eight compartments involving susceptible epithelial cells Sh , infected epithelial cells Ih ,
SARS-CoV-2 viral load Vh at within-host scale and susceptible human population Sp , exposed population Ep ,
infected population Ip , recovered populations Rp and environmental viral load Vp at between-host scale. The
assumptions for the proposed model include the following.
1. The within-host dynamics are assumed to occur at fast time scale s while the dynamics of the between-host
scale variables is assumed to occur at slow time scale t.
2. We assume that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted only through environmental(indirect) transmission.
3. We do not consider the asymptomatic patients for this study as there is no sufficient evidence of withinhost dynamics of asymptomatic patients. We employ the basic SEIR model at between-host level.
Based on the above assumptions we propose the following multi scale model for COVID-19.

The first compartment in the model 1 deals with the dynamics of susceptible epithelial cells Sh (s). They
decrease at a rate β following contact with the virus. The second compartment deals with the dynamics of
infected epithelial cells. They are increased through infection of susceptible cells and are decreased through
clearance by cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10 at the rate d1 , d2 , d3 ,
d4 , d5 and d6 respectively and through natural death at a rate µ. Compartment three deals with SARS-CoV-2
viral load. The viral load is increased due to reproduction of virus in the infected cells at the rate α. This viral
load is decreased due to clearance by cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10
at the rate b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 , b5 and b6 respectively and they are released into environment at a rate αh . The term
αh links within-host and between-host scales in a uni-directional way.
We assume that the total human population Np in the between-host dynamics is divided into four subgroups
denoted by Sp , Ep , Ip and Rp which represent respectively, the susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered
or the removed population. Compartment 4 in the model (1) describes the dynamics of susceptible humans.
They are assumed to be supplied at a constant rate πp through birth and are removed at the natural death rate
µp . They are also reduced by interaction with infected cells and virus in the environment through the terms
ηp Sp (t)Ip (t)
and ηw Sp (t)Vp (t) respectively. Compartment 5 describes the dynamics of exposed humans. They
Np (t)
η S (t)I (t)

become exposed due to contacts with either infected people or virus particles through the terms p N
and
p (t)
ηw Sp (t)Vp (t) respectively. They are removed at the natural death rate µp and the rate at which they become
infected through ωp . Compartment 6 describes the dynamics of infected humans. Exposed humans become
infected after the incubation period at the rate ωp . They are reduced through medication or natural death
at the rate τp and µp respectively. Compartment 7 describes the dynamics of recovered individuals. Infected
humans are recovered at the rate τp and are removed due to natural death at the rate µp . Finally compartment
8 describes the dynamics of viral load in the environment.The viral load in the environment is contributed
by infected cells at the rate αh Vh through coughing/sneezing. The virus particles cannot live in environment
without invading into host cell for long time. The virus will get killed at the rate π. The values for these various
parameters is given in table 1.

The reduced-order multi scale model

There are two difficulties in working with the proposed multi scale model.
1. Time scale mismatch: The within-host scale is in terms of a fast time scale s, while the between-host
scale is in terms of a slow time scale t.
2. Transient Vh (s) : Vh (s) remains non-zero only for a short period since the infection remains only for few
days.
As discussed in [4] these problems can be overcome by changing the measure of host-infectiousness from
Vh (s) to a new quantity Nh (the area under the viral load curve). In similar lines to reduction of order done in

[4], we get the reduced multi scale model as

with the initial conditions Sp (0) ≥ 0, Ep (0) ≥ 0, Ip (0) ≥ 0, Rp (0) ≥ 0 and Vp (0) ≥ 0.
In similar lines to the work [4], the basic reproductive number for the within-host scale sub model in model

Stability Analysis of the reduced multi scale model

In this section, we do the stability analysis for the reduced multi scale model 2.

3.1

Disease free equilibrium and R0

The disease-free equilibrium for the model 2 is given by

E 0 = Sp0 , Ep0 , Ip0 , Rp0 , Vp0 =



We now calculate the basic reproduction number of the multi scale model 2 using the next generation matrix
approach [9].
The Jacobian evaluated at the disease-free equilibrium, E 0 , is given by


The J(E0 ) can be decomposed into two matrices F and V such that J(E 0 ) = F − V, where F is the transmission
and non-negative matrix describing the generation of secondary infections and V is the transition and nonsingular matrix, describing the changes in individual states such as removal by death, recovery and excretion
of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment by infected human in the community. Since the environment acts as a
reservoir of the infective pathogen, we have,

The basic reproductive number is given by the spectral radius (dominant eigenvalue) of the matrix F V −1 .
So in this case, we have the basic reproduction number of the system 2 to be

ηp ωp + (ηp ωp )2 + w p h h pµp πp p p p
R0 =

2(ωp + µp )(τp + µp )
Theorem 1: The DFE E 0 of the system 2 is locally asymptotically stable if R0 < 1.
Proof: The Jacobian matrix evaluated at E0 is given by

From the above jacobian matrix, it can be seen that the two of the eigen values are given by -µp (repeated
twice). The rest can be obtained through the characteristic equation given below.
λ3 + a1 λ2 + a2 λ + a3 = 0,
where
a1 = π + ωp + τp + 2µp
a2 = (ωp + µp )(τp + µp ) + π(ωp + τp + 2µp ) − ωp ηp
ηw πp Nh αh
a3 = (ωp + µp )(τp + µp )π − ωp (πηp +

µp

When R0 ¡ 1, a2 , a3 are positive. Since a1 has all positive terms, all the coefficients of the characteristic
equation are positive when R0 ¡ 1. Further, by Routh-Hurtwiz criterion for a third order polynomial, we get
that all the eigen values of the characteristic polynomial to be negative as a0i s > 0, for i = 1, 2, 3.[2]. Hence
the DFE E 0 is locally asymptotically stable when R0 < 1 as all the eigen values of the jacobian matrix are
negative.

3.2

Endemic equilibrium

Let E = (Sp , Ep , Ip , Rp , Vp ) denote the endemic equilibrium point of the system 2. To get the endemic equilibrium, we set the left-hand side of the equations of the model system 2 equal to zero and determine the nontrivial
solution of the resulting algebraic equations, which gives

Sp =

It can be seen from the definition of Ip that the endemic equilibrium E exists only when R0 > 1.
Theorem 2: The endemic equilibrium E of the system 2 is locally asymptotically stable if R0 > 1.
Proof: It can be seen from the above discussions that the endemic equilibrium E exists only when R0 > 1.
And also from theorem 1 the DFE E 0 is unstable in such a case. Moreover, as the system 2 admits only two
equilibria from the uniqueness and boundedness of solutions for the system 2 we conclude that the endemic
equilibrium E is asymptotically stable whenever it exists i.e., whenever R0 > 1.

Numerical simulations

The multi scale model 1 is uni-directionally coupled such that only the within-host scale sub model influences
the between-host scale sub model without any reciprocal feedback. Owing to this, in this section, we study
and numerically illustrate the influence of the four within-host scale sub model parameters, namely β, α,
d(= d1 + · · · + d6 ) and b(= b1 + · · · + b6 ) on the between-host scale sub model variables ( Sp , Ep , Ip , Rp , Vp ).

Figure 3 depicts that as the infected cell burst rate increases, SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community
also increases. Therefore, drugs that inhibit viral replication (such as Arbidol, remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir)
which in turn reduce the production rate of virus at within-host scale will likely reduce transmission of SARSCoV-2 at between-host scale.

between-host scale apart from benefits to the infected individual.

between-host scale apart from benefits to the infected individual.

Evaluating the comparative effectiveness of health interventions
dealing with within-host and between-host scales

In this section we do the comparative effectiveness studies. We consider the following four health interventions
dealing with within-host and between-host scales.
1. Antiviral drugs:
a. Drugs that inhibit viral replication: Drugs such as Arbidol, remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir inhibit
viral replication in infected cells. So we choose α to be α(1 − ).
b. Drugs that block virus binding to susceptible cells : Drugs such as Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) does
this job. So we choose β to be β(1 − γ).
2. Immunotherapies : In this intervention the rate of clearance of virus increases due to antibodies. This in
turn reduces the number of infected cells. So we choose (d1 + d2 +d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 ) to be (d1 + d2
+d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 )(1 + κ).
3. Environmental hygiene: Decontamination from frequently touched spaces like door handles etc., reduces
environmental virus. So we choose π to be π(1 + δ).
4. Generalized Social distancing: No mass gatherings, prayer meetings and educational institutions reduces
contact with community viral load. So we choose ηw to be ηw (1 − σ).
R0 plays a crucial role in understanding the spread of infection in the individual and Vp determines the
infectivity of virus in an individual. Taking these four health interventions into consideration, we now have
modified basic reproductive number RE and modified virus count VE of the endemic equilibrium to be

We now do the comparative effectiveness study of these interventions by calculating the percentage reduction
of R0 and Vp for single and multiple combination of these interventions at different efficacy levels such as (a)
low efficacy of 0.3, (b) medium efficacy of 0.6, and (c)high efficacy of 0.9.

We now consider 20 different combinations of these four health interventions. The comparative effectiveness
is calculated and measured on a scale from 1 to 20 with 1 denoting the lowest comparative effectiveness while
20 denoting the highest comparative effectiveness.
The outcomes of the comparative effectiveness study suggest the following.
1. When a single strategy is implemented, treatment with drugs such as Arbidol, remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir
that inhibits viral replication show significant decrease of R0 relative to other four interventions at all
efficacy levels.
2. Considering the severity of this pandemic, one single strategy is not sufficient to tackle this infection at
the earliest. When environmental hygiene and generalized social distancing are implemented along with
treatment of single drug, treating with drugs that inhibits viral replication performs better again at all
efficacy levels.

3. Now that governments are accepting the fact that we have to live with the virus for long and planning
for unlock strategies, generalized social distancing like closure of schools does not seem practical. By
considering only environmental hygiene, along with the drugs that inhibits viral replication seem to perform
twice better than other drugs at all efficacy levels.
4. A combined strategy involving treatment with drugs such as Arbidol, remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir
that inhibits viral replication and immunotherapies like monoclonal antibodies, along with environmental
hygiene and generalized social distancing seems to perform the best among all combinations considered
at all efficacy levels.

Discussion and Conclusions

In this work a novel nested multi scale model for COVID-19 is proposed and studied. We initially study the
dynamics of this system and do the stability analysis. Later using the technique of comparative effectiveness we
study the efficacy of four health interventions dealing with within-host and between-host scales. The results suggest that a combined strategy involving treatment with drugs such as Arbidol, remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir
that inhibits viral replication and immunotherapies like monoclonal antibodies, along with environmental hygiene and generalized social distancing proved to be the best and optimal in reducing the basic reproduction
number and environmental virus at the population level.
With a lot of research happening in the field of multi-drug therapy, our results offer some basic insights of
their efficiency and effectiveness at population scale. These results can be helpful in public health measures
and policies. With more availability of data of within-host dynamics in COVID-19 patients, a better refined
and comprehensive models can be framed based on this model that can more closer to real life situations. The
multi scale modeling studies done here is the first of its kind for COVID-19.
