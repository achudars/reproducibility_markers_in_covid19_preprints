ABSTRACT We propose a new technique of utilizing metamaterials-based sensor for rapid diagnosis of
covid-19 through electromagnetic-stimulated analysis of the blood drawn from the patient. The sensor was
inspired by a coronavirus in plane-shaped design with presume that its circular structure might produce a
broader interaction of the electromagnetic waves with the blood sample. The sensor was designed
numerically and tested experimentally by evaluating variations in the reflection coefficient (S11) and
transmission coefficient (S21) of the waves at resonant frequency. Results of covid-19 relevant blood
sample showed a pronounced shift in the main resonant frequency of about 740 MHz compared to that of
the control blood sample. We believe that with the help of the proposed sensor a significant breakthrough
can be achieved for rapid diagnosis of covid-19 within few seconds.

I. INTRODUCTION

The pandemic coronavirus diseas-2019, commonly called
COVID-19, is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus that
recognized as Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus2 (SRAS-CoV-2) [1, 2]. The virus is a member
of Coronaviridae family, which contains enveloped single
stranded RNA viruses. The SRAS-CoV-2 primarily attacks
the respiratory system of human and occasionally causes
severe pneumonia. The sever cases is also followed by
multi-organ dysfunctions, respiratory failure, and death[3].
The COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan-Hubei
province of China in December 2019, soon after the disease
occurred in different countries around the world [4, 5]. So,
COVID-19 was announced as a pandemic disease by World
Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020[6]. Up to

23rdJune 2020, about9 million cases and almost half a
million deaths were reported globally [7]. Despite tight
medical actions by the countries, these data reveal that
further
preventive,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
measurements are still required so as to control the
pandemic as soon as possible. Currently, there are both
immunological and molecular laboratory tests for the
detection of COVID-19. However, the immunological
antigen-antibody test may have sensitivity and specificity
drawbacks [8], while the molecular polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) has the disadvantages of lacking the PCR
infrastructure in every hospitals, cost and time-consuming
[8, 9]. The quick ascending morbidity of COVID-19 makes
alternative diagnostic techniques necessary. Consequently,
the future developed diagnostic methods should be more

1

sensitive, cheaper and faster in order to cope with the
increasing number of COVID-19 cases around the world.
It is well known that the human blood is composed of
plasma and cells. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood and
a mixture of water, proteins (albumin, clotting factors,
antibodies, enzymes, and hormones) and other dissolved
materials. The blood cells are erythrocyte (red blood cell),
leukocytes (white blood cells) and thrombocytes. The
leucocytes include neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils,
monocytes and lymphocytes. These white cells are related
to body defense against pathogens [10]. Studies observed
alterations in the biochemistry and cellular components of
blood in COVID-19 patients. The biochemical components
of blood such as Alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
C-reactive protein
(CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and Urea
significantly increased, while albumin decreased in the
serum of the PCR positive COVID-19 patients [11-14].
Unlike most bacterial and viral infections that generally
cause high leukocyte [15], and lymphocyte counts [16],
significant decreases occurred in the number and
percentage of leukocytes and lymphocytes in PCR
confirmed cases of COVID-19 [11, 12, 14, 1720].Therefore, developing a technique to detect the changes
in these unique blood parameters could be a significant
achievement for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19.
A review of literature showed that a pronounced variation
in the dielectric permittivity of blood is occurred when
counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, as well as IgG and IgM
antibodies in are altered [21-23]. Hence, based on the
aforementioned evidences that leukocytes and lymphocytes
in the blood of Covid-19 patients are dramatically reduced,
we have established the hypothesis that it is possible to
detect changes in the dielectric permittivity of blood among
covid-19 patients by the use of electromagnetic inspired
metamaterial sensors. The involvement of metamaterials
(MTMs) in the construction of highly sensitive sensors has
become a new trend. This is due to the periodical structure
of the MTMs, which acts to manipulate the electromagnetic
waves behavior and hence producing unique features such
as negative refractive index, permeability and permittivity
[24, 25].
We have previously reported various designs and shapes of
metamaterial-based sensors for the detection of different
liquids and chemical materials [24-26]. The working
principle of these sensors is based on the shift of resonant

2

frequency in the transmitted electromagnetic signals
through the samples due to their difference in permittivity
and permeability values. In this study and for the first time,
we propose MTM-based sensor for rapid detection and
diagnosis of covid-19. The selected sensor design was
inspired by a coronavirus-shaped architecture with a
presume that this kind of circular structure may lead to a
broader interaction of the electromagnetic waves with the
blood sample. The proposed sensor was designed and tested
both numerically and experimentally by evaluating
variations in reflection coefficient (S11) and transmission
coefficient (S21) at resonant frequency. Results showed that
the proposed sensor can be a viable tool for rapid detection
and diagnosis of covid-19 patients within few seconds.

II. DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF THE PROPOSED
SENSOR

The corona virus-shaped microwave sensor was designed
and numerically investigated by CST microwave suite based
on the Finite Integration Technique (FIT). The sensor
incorporates a corona-virus shaped resonator connected with
a transmission line, as shown in Figure 1, where P1 is the
first port, P2 is the second port, L is inductance of the CRR,
R is resistance of the CRR, C1 is capacitance between the
outer CRR and inner conductor and C2 is capacitance
between the inner conductor and ground plane. The layout of
the proposed sensor, composed of three layers, along with its
equivalent electrical circuit, is shown in Figure 2. On the top
layer, a closed ring resonator, with star-shaped conductor
inside it, is joined with two transmission lines. The top layer
is made of copper with a conductivity of 5.8 Ã— 107 S/m and
thickness of 0.035 mm, while both ends of the transmission
lines are excited by discrete port 1 and 2. The second layer is
FR-4 substrate with a thickness of 1.6 mm, dielectric
constants and loss tangent of 4.3 and 0.02, respectively. This
substrate layer has been chosen due to the low loss value and
availability in our labs. The bottom layer is fully covered
with a copper metal of 0.035 mm thick, which behaves as a
ground plate for the structure. The space between closed
circular ring (CCR) and the conductive inner star shape is
utilized as the sensor layer to be filled with blood samples
under investigation.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

FIGURE 2: (a) Prospective view of the proposed metamaterials-based
sensor and (b) its equivalent circuit diagram.

The coronavirus-shaped resonator was fabricated by using
LPKF ProtoMAT E33 prototyping machine with the same
dimensions of the numerically designed one and tested in
the frequency range from 4 to 8 GHz, as shown in Figure 3.
Two coaxial test cables were connected to the metamaterial
sensor via two ports, as shown in Figure 3-b. Before taking
measurements, the vector network analyzer (VNA) was
connected to the structure through the coaxial cables and
then calibration has been done in three steps of open circuit,
short circuit and 50 Ohm load connector in the desired
frequency range, as shown in Figure 3-c. To take the
reference data, simulation and experiment were carried out
with the presence of air and three blood samples in the
sensor layer.

The reflection (S11) and the transmission (S21) coefficients
in magnitude and in decibel were monitored to investigate
the interaction of electromagnetic (EM) field with the
designed sensor over the frequency range of 4-8 GHz (Cband), as shown in Figure 4. It was seen from the results
that there exist three minima and maxima peaks at the
resonant frequencies of 4.75 GHz, 6.5 GHz, and 7.75 GHz
for reflection and transmission coefficient parameter of
designed sensor, respectively with magnitude of -14 dB, 13.5dB and -13.3 dB, respectively. This makes the sensor to
be efficiently used for COVID-19 diagnoses over this wide
range of frequency (C-band).

Dielectric Loss Factor

The measured dielectric permittivity and loss tangent for air
and normal blood were recorded and data were imported
into the CST software to estimate the reflection coefficient
and transmission coefficient. To measure the dielectric
constant and dielectric loss factor of normal blood, a
dielectric probe kit device was utilized in conjunction with
vector network analyser (VNA) Agilent 85070E, as shown
in Figure 5. The measured electrical properties of normal
blood in the frequency range 0-12 GHz are shown in Figure
6. Initially, the dielectric probe was calibrated by using air
and pure water of known electromagnetic parameters [27].
Table 1 shows the parameters values at specified
frequencies. One can see from the results that the dielectric
constant has decreased linearly with the increase of
frequency. However, the dielectric loss factor was
exponentially decreased from 0 to 2 GHz and then
increased gradually to reach a plateau shape at high
frequencies from 9 GHz onwards.

Regarding the blood of COVID-19 patient (COVID-19
blood henceforth), data of dielectric constant and loss
tangent was calculated based on their decrement by 5%
compared to that of the normal blood at high frequency, i.e.
the plateau region. It was evidenced from literature that
dielectric permittivity of blood is decreased when the count
of lymphocytes is increased [21, 22]. Ermolina et. al. used
different mixture formulas to conclude that the relationship
between static dielectric permittivity of blood as functions
of volume fraction of cells is almost linear from 0% to
about 20% of cells volume fraction [22]. It was reported
that in most cases of COVID-19, lymphocyte percentage
(LYM%) was reduced to lower than 5% [28]. Furthermore,
when the immunoglobulin/antibody proteins are just started
to produce by the immune system in response to the
COVID-19 antigen, the dielectric permittivity is further
lowered. This is because it was evidenced that the increase
of IgG and IgM immunoglobulins has led to the decreased
capacitance and dielectric permittivity of blood [23].
Hence, 5% smaller values of dielectric permittivity and loss
tangent compared to those of the normal blood were
imported into the CST software to represent the electrical
response of COVID-19 blood. Figure 7 shows the reflection
coefficient for air, normal blood and COVID-19 blood
samples. It can be seen that the resonant frequency has
three different peaks at 4.38 GHz, 6.26 GHz and 7.82 GHz
corresponding to the reflection -13 dB, -15.2and -29 dB,
respectively. Interestingly, for the covid-19 samples, the
resonant frequency presented two peaks at 5.1GHz and 7
GHz, with a pronounced shift of about 720 MHz and 740
MHz, respectively. We believe that with the help of the

Similarly, the transmission coefficient of the sensor layer
filled with COVID-19 blood showed a significant shift in
the resonant frequency compared to that of air and normal
blood-filled sensor, as shown in Figure 8. In the case of
COVID-19 blood, the frequency maxima have shifted
towards higher frequency by about 620 MHz and 750 MHz,
respectively. This suggests that the proposed structure can
be highly sensitive for the detection of COVID-19.

Figure 9 shows the simulated result of phase variation in the
transmitted wave recorded in the frequency range from 4 to 8
GHz when different samples were inserted into the sensor
layer. One can notice from the figure that the degree of phase
variation is highly deviated for each of the samples under
test. Consequently, the blood of patients with covid-19 has
resulted in a pronounced phase difference compared to that
of the normal blood, implying that the sensor can be highly
efficient for the detection of covid-19 cases.

In order to perform parametric study on the proposed sensor,
thereby optimizing its geometrical dimensions, the built-in
genetic algorithm in the CST software was used with empty
sample. The effect of sensor layer radius (Rs), width of the
transmission line (WT) and radius of the outer ring (Ro) on
the resonant frequency in both reflection (S11) and
transmission (S21) mode was monitored, as shown in Figure
10. As such, a clear shift in the resonant frequency was
observed when the radius increased from 8.4 mm to 9.6 mm.
The important part of the designed structure is the sensor
layer because when the samples are put inside it, the resonant
frequency can be shifted with respect to the change in
electrical properties of the samples. Even a small variation in
the electrical properties of the samples has resulted in a clear
shift in the resonant frequency, which might be because of
the symmetrical structure of the sensor. Results showed that
the optimum value of radius of the sensor layer is 9 mm.

Figure 11 shows the effect of varying width of the
transmission line on the resonant frequency of the reflection
and transmission coefficient spectra of the sensor.
Noticeably, the variation width of the transmission line has
affected on the resonant frequency, where the optimum vale
of the transmission line width was set to be 1.5 mm. Results
indicated that the thinner the transmission line, the lower
transmission coefficient and vice versa. It was seen from the
Figure 11(b) that there exist three maxima peaks at the
resonant frequencies of 4.75 GHz, 6.5 GHz, and 7.75 GHz
for the transmission coefficient with the bandwidth is about
1.75 GHz.

The final parametric study was taken by changing the radius
of the outer ring resonator from 9.5 mm to 11.5 mm in steps
of 0.5 mm, while other dimensions were kept constant. The
optimum value of this parameter was found to be 10.5 mm, at
which the reflection coefficient presented three resonant
peaks at 4.75 GHz, 6.5 GHz and 7.80 GHz, as shown in
Figure 12. It is worth to mention that at a small radius of 9.5
mm, resonant frequency resulted in a significant shift of
about 4.25 GHz, 5.75 GHz and 7 GHz for the first, second
and third resonance peaks, respectively. Consequently, the
total shift in the resonant frequency is about 500 MHz, 750
MHz and 800 MHz. When the outer radius of the resonator
was set to 9.5 mm and 10 mm, there was a clear shift seen.
This can be attributed to the overall dimension of the
resonator and that the waveguide wall is higher than the other
dimensions of the coronavirus resonator

The electrical properties, lactate, glucose level and

work are shown in table 2. Figure 13 shows the measured
reflection and transmission coefficient of the sensor with and
without the presence of normal blood samples. Interestingly,
the performance of the sensor in the low frequency range and
at the main resonant frequency of 4.75 GHz is highly stable
in terms of results reproductively. It was seen that the
resonant frequency position remained unchanged when three
samples of normal blood were tested. Hence, we believe that
the proposed sensor can be efficiently utilized for rapid
detection of covid-19 within few seconds. In this way, the
use of metamaterial sensors can be a significant breakthrough
for rapid covid-19 diagnosis.

observed that the current flow is bidirectional from the centre
of the resonator to the ports and vice versa. The current
distributing on the outer ring resonators emerges from the
outside and enters at the resonatorâ€™s junction. Consequently,
the parallel and antiparallel current flowing is responsible for
controlling the electric and magnetic responses, respectively.
In conclusion, the electric and magnetic response of the
whole sensor can be interpreted to detect various samples
based on their intrinsic dielectric parameters.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this study and for the first time, a metamaterial-based
sensor was successfully employed for rapid diagnosis of
covid-19. The sensor was designed numerically and tested
experimentally by evaluating variations in the reflection
coefficient (S11) and transmission coefficient (S21) of the
waves at resonant frequency. The measured electrical
properties (dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor) of
the normal blood are 64.9 and 50 respectively, Results of
covid-19 relevant blood sample showed a pronounced shift in
the main resonant frequency of about 740 MHz compared to
that of the control blood sample. It was concluded that with
the help of the proposed sensor a significant breakthrough
can be achieved for rapid diagnosis of covid-19 within few
seconds.
FIGURE 14: Surface current distribution across the coronavirus-shaped
sensor at resonant frequency of 4.75 GHz.

Figure 15 shows that the electric field distributions over the
proposed sensor at resonant frequency of 4.75 GHz are
mostly located at the segment of discrete port one with a
small concentration around port two. This is where the
electric field distribution spanned towards port tow with less
concentration around port one. It is known that the
electromagnetic field can travel through the two ported
conductive transmission lines, where the electric field and
magnetic field components are perpendicular to each other
and are perpendicular to the propagation direction. The
transmission line is copper, which is a metallic layer and,
hence, it is affected by the electric field component of the
travelling wave.
