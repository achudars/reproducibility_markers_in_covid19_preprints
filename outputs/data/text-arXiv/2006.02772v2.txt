Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection is mediated by the binding of its spike protein to
the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which plays a pivotal role in the reninangiotensin system (RAS). The study of RAS dysregulation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is fundamentally important for a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and risk factors associated with COVID-19 coronavirus disease, and to design
effective therapeutic strategies. In this context, we developed a mathematical model of
RAS based on data regarding protein and peptide concentrations; the model was tested
on clinical data from healthy normotensive and hypertensive individuals. We then used
our model to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RAS, which we modeled
through a down-regulation of ACE2 as a function of viral load. We also used it to
predict the effect of RAS-targeting drugs, such as RAS-blockers, human recombinant
ACE2, and angiotensin 1-7 peptide, on COVID-19 patients; the model predicted an
improvement of the clinical outcome for some drugs and a worsening for others.

Introduction
Since December 2019, the world has been facing a global viral pandemic of the novel severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, ‘SARS-CoV-2’; this pandemic has, to date, caused
millions of people to be infected and hundreds of thousands to die (Dong et al., 2020). First
detected in the city of Wuhan (China) (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Chen et al.,
2020b; Wu et al., 2020), SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly throughout the world. The coronavirus
family, to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs, includes a number of viruses, such as SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV, that have been implicated in serious epidemics that cause acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS). There is not yet consensus on the origin of the SARS-CoV-2
(Andersen et al., 2020; Benvenuto et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b; Zhou et al., 2020), but

the primary hypothesis is that it originated from bat (Rhinolophus affinisor ) or pangolin
(Manis javanica), since the genomes of these two viral species share high sequence identity
with SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviral genomes encode a series of structural proteins, one of which is the spike
glycoprotein or S-protein that protrudes from the membrane surface (Zhou et al., 2020).
Similar to the SARS-CoV virus that was identified in 2003, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 has
been shown to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) so that it can be used as
an entry receptor to the cell (Zhou et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a; Cao
et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020). This protein plays a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin system
(RAS) signaling pathway (Burrell et al., 2004) by cleaving angiotensin I and II peptides to
generate angiotensin 1–9 and the biologically active peptide angiotensin 1–7, respectively
(Donoghue et al., 2000; Tipnis et al., 2000). ACE2 is highly expressed in type II alveolar
cells of lung, epithelial cells of oral mucosa, colon enterocytes, myocardial cells and kidney
proximal tubule cells. The protective role of ACE2 in severe ARDS is also widely recognized
(Imai et al., 2005; Kuba et al., 2005). Indeed, it has been shown, both in vitro and in vivo
mouse models, that a loss of ACE2 expression causes increased production of angiotensin II,
and that this contributes to lung failure (Kuba et al., 2005)
It has already been established years ago that the SARS-CoV spike protein interferes
with RAS due to its binding to ACE2 (Li et al., 2003), thus causing ACE2 downregulation;
this has opened up a number of interesting means of tackling SARS-CoV infection through
RAS modulation. Indeed, injection of a soluble form of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2,
GSK2586881) into mice infected with SARS-CoV appears to have a double role (Kuba et al.,
2005): it slows the viral infection by binding to the S-protein and rescues ACE2 activity, thus
causing angiotensin II reduction and protecting lung from severe failure.
rhACE2 has been tested in phase II trials for its ability to ameliorate ARDS (Khan et al.,
2017). Although rhACE2 treatment is well tolerated by patients and it offers a significant
reduction in angiotensin II level, the clinical distress severity was not reduced in a recent
pilot study (Khan et al., 2017). Further studies are needed to understand the biological
differences between the responses of animal models and humans.
Since SARS-CoV-2 also targets ACE2 receptors when it infects cells, it is logical to hypothesize that rhACE2 might help reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease (Gheblawi et al.,
2020). Indeed, it has been shown that rhACE2 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, and
that this inhibition depends both on the initial quantity of the virus and on rhACE2 concentration (Monteil et al., 2020). Following these exciting results, a clinical trial with exogenous
submission of rhACE2 recently started (NCT04287686, 2020). A number of other clinical
trials are also underway that target the dysregulated RAS system to restore its functionality (NCT04332666, 2020; NCT04335786, 2020; NCT04312009, 2020; NCT04311177, 2020;
NCT04318418, 2020).
Hypertension and cardiovascular disease have been shown to be risk factors in cases of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. This brings into question what might be the potential effects on
COVID-19 development of the RAS-targeting drugs that are used to treat hypertension and
cardiovascular disease. RAS-targeting drugs fall into three categories: (i) angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), (ii) angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and (iii) direct renin
inhibitors (DRI) (Fig. 1). Several recent studies on large patient cohorts (Reynolds et al.,
2020; Mancia et al., 2020; Mehra et al., 2020) conclude that there is only weak correlation
between treatment with drugs from these categories and any substantial increase in risk of
2

COVID-19 disease.
Despite these interesting findings, there is not yet a detailed understanding of how SARSCoV-2 infection leads to a dysregulation of RAS and, in severe cases, to ARDS. It is of
fundamental importance that we gain better insights into the perturbed RAS in order to
properly elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and associated risk factors of SARS-CoV-2
infection; this, in turn, will enable novel therapeutic strategies to be designed and tested so
that disease progression can be inhibited.

Results
The main objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of RAS-targeting drugs and SARSCoV-2 infection, both individually and in combination, on RAS. We started by setting up the
dynamical model describing RAS of healthy normotensive and hypertensive individuals. The
robustness and predictive power of our model was assessed by investigating the effects of three
types of antihypertensive drugs: (i) ACE-I, (ii) ARB and (iii) DRI. This assessment included
a comparison of model simulations with patient clinical data. Following confirmation of model
robustness and accuracy, ACE2 downregulation due to viral infection was introduced into the
model to quantitatively predict how RAS is perturbed in COVID-19.

Modeling the renin-angiotensin system
The RAS system has been widely studied (Paul et al., 2006; Raizada et al., 1993; Casarini
et al., 2016). It plays a key role in the regulation of a large series of physiological systems
among which the renal, lung and cardiovascular systems. Consequently, its dysregulation is
related to multiple pathological conditions such as hypertension and ARDS, just to mention
some of them (Ruiz-Ortega et al., 2001; de Man et al., 2012; Jia et al., 2018; te Riet et al.,
2015; Kobori et al., 2007).
There are two different types of RAS: the circulating RAS that is localized in the plasma
and is involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular system, and the tissue-localized systems
that act intracellularly or interstitially within different organs in association with the systemic
RAS or independently of it. Here we focus on the local RAS within the pulmonary circulation
and model its network of biochemical reactions schematically depicted in Fig. 1.
When the blood pressure decreases, the juxtaglomerular kidney cells that sense changes
in renal perfusion pressure secret an aspartic protease protein called renin (RE, EC 3.4.23.15).
The activity of this enzyme, called plasma renin activity (P RA), is the common measure used
in clinical practice to set up diagnosis and treatment design of essential hypertension.
The dynamics of the renin concentration can be modeled as:
Log 2
d[RE]
=β−
[RE]
dt
hre

(1)

where hre is renin’s half-life and β its production rate. The latter is not constant but depends
on other elements of the RAS system which we will discuss later in the section. The role of
renin is to cleave the N-terminus of a protein from the serine protease inhibitor family called
angiotensinogen (AGT) to form the decapeptide hormone angiotensin I (AngI). Assuming nonlinear Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the dynamics of the angiotensinogen can be written as:

and thus influences the reaction rate, the AGT concentration is much larger than the RE

be linearly approximated as:
d[AGT]

where the reaction rate cre relates the renin concentration to its activity.
The AngI peptide is further cleaved by different enzymes:

(3)

• The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC3.4.15.1), a zinc metalloproteinase located
mainly in the capillaries of the lungs and in the endothelial cells. It catalyzes the
transformation of AngI into the octapeptide angiotensin II (AngII).
• Chymase (CHY, EC 3.4.21.39), a serine protease that is mainly localized in blood vessels
and heart. It also catalyzes the transformation of AngI into AngII.
4

• Neprilysin (NEP, EC3.4.24.11), another zinc metalloproteinase that is expressed in a
wide variety of tissues. It catalyzes the transformation of AngI into the heptapeptide
hormone angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang1-7).
The dynamics of AngI can thus be described as:
d[AngI]
Log 2
= cre [RE] − (cace + cchy + cnep ) [AngI] −
[AngI]

hangI

(4)

where cace , cchy and cnep are the reaction rates associated with the corresponding enzymatic
reactions. To get this relation, we started from the non-linear Michaelis-Menten kinetic term,
ace
which reads for ACE: [ACE][AngI]/([AngI] + KM
). As the substrate concentration [AngI] is
ace
), we dropped
here much lower than the Michaelis constant of the reaction ([AngI] << KM
it from the denominator and considered the equilibrium concentrations of the ACE enzyme
fixed, so that the reaction term becomes linear in the concentration of the AngI substrate.
We made the same approximation for the reactions involving CHY and NEP and for all other
reactions described below.
The role of AngII in RAS is central since it has a vasoconstriction effect, enhances blood
pressure, and triggers inflammatory processes and fibrosis. In lung, the capillary blood vessels are among the sites that have the highest ACE expression and production of AngII. Its
dysregulation has frequently been related to a wide series of chronic and acute diseases such
as pulmonary fibrosis and ARDS.
AngII effects are mediated by two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) called angiotensin
II type 1 (AT1R) and type 2 (AT2R). In addition, it can be cleaved by different enzymes.
For example, ACE2 generates Ang1-7 peptides and aminopeptidase A (APA, EC 3.4. 11.7)
generates other peptides such as angiotensin III (AngIII) which is further cleaved to AngIV.
In our model, we skipped all details about the enzymatic reactions AngII-AngIII-AngIV and
kept only a single equation for their transformation. The dynamics of AngII and AngIV can
thus be written as:
d[AngII]
= (cace + cchy ) [AngI]

where hangII and hangIV are the half-lives of the peptides and cace2 , cangIV , cat1r and cat2r the
rates of the enzymatic reactions.
The dynamics of the peptide-bound form of the GPCRs are expressed as:

where [AT1R-AngII] and [AT1R-AngII] are the concentrations of the bound forms of the receptors, and hat1r and hat2r their half-lives.
Until now, we have modeled the ACE/AngII/AT1R regulatory axis of the RAS system.
Since the last two decades, it became clear that there is another RAS axis that acts as a
counterregulator of the first axis (Simões e Silva et al., 2013). The key role of this second axis
is played by the Ang1-7 peptide that is mainly produced from AngII by the ACE2 enzyme and
binds to the transmembrane GPCR called MAS. However, Ang1-7 can also be obtained as an
enzymatic product from AngI via the catalytic activity of NEP and, to a lesser extent, from
Ang1-9 via ACE and NEP. We overlooked the Ang1-9-related enzymatic reactions in our model,
as they contribute less to Ang1-7 formation (Raizada et al., 1993; Casarini et al., 2016). The
dynamical equations for the Ang1-7 peptide and the MAS-bound receptor are as follows:
Log 2
d[Ang1-7]

Let us now go back to Eq. (1) in which we simply expressed the renin production as a
baseline term β. To describe the autoregulatory nature of the RAS system, this term has
to depend on the production of other species, thus introducing a feedback regulation. It is
known that this feedback depends on AT1R bound to AngII. Following other models (Leete
et al., 2018; Leete and Layton, 2019), we expressed β as:


[AT1R-AngII]N
0
β = β0 + 
[AT1R-AngII]

!δ



− 1

(11)

where β0 is a constant parameter to be identified and [AT1R-AngII]N
0 the equilibrium concentration for healthy normotensive humans. δ is a positive number that we fixed to 0.8 (Leete
et al., 2018).
Technical details on the procedure used to solve the model and on model stability are
given in the Materials and Methods section.

Modeling blood pressure and antihypertensive RAS-blocker effects
Blood pressure is well known to be increased by the concentration of AngII bound to AT1R.
It has also been described to be decreased by the concentration of MAS bound to Ang1-7 and
of AT2R bound to AngII, but the precise mechanism is not yet known (Povlsen et al., 2020;
Santos et al., 2003; Carey, 2017). Therefore, we did not introduce in our model a feedback
between these concentrations and renin production, as we did for AT1R-AngII, and modeled
the blood pressure (DBP) simply from the AT1R-AngII concentration:
DBP = P0 + P1 [AT1R-AngII]

(12)

We chose to fix the two parameters P0 and P1 to mimic the diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
rather than the systolic one. We thus fixed DBP equal to 80 mmHg for normotensive individuals and to 110 mmHg for hypertensive individuals. Hence, P0 + P1 [AT1R-AngII]N
0 = 80
6

mmHg and P0 + P1 [AT1R-AngII]H
0 = 110 mmHg, where the N and H superscripts denote
concentration in normotensive and hypertensive individuals and the 0 subscript, equilibrium
concentrations.
Since dysregulated RAS with high levels of AngII are related to essential hypertension, a
wide range of RAS-targeting drugs have been developed in the last fourty years (Zaman et al.,
2002). They can be classified in three different categories based on their pharamacological
target (Williams, 2016):
• Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) that bind to ACE and thus inhibit
the formation of angiotensin II and the associated vasoconstriction and inflammatory
cascades. Examples of this type of drugs are enalapril, lisinopril and captopril.
• Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) that block the binding of AngII to AT1R and thus
act in antagonism with AngII. Examples are candesartan, losartan and valsartan.
• Direct renin inhibitors (DRI) that act on renin and thus inihibit the conversion of AGT
to AngI. Examples are aliskiren, enalkiren and remikiren.
We modeled the action of these three types of drugs by modifying the reaction rates
associated to their targets as:
cace −→ cace × (1 − γACE-I )
cat1r −→ cat1r × (1 − γARB )
cre −→ cre × (1 − γDRI )

(13)

where γACE-I , γARB and γDRI are parameters describing the drug activity.

Model predictions and clinical data on RAS-blocker drugs
The effect of enalapril, an ACE-I type drug, on plasma ACE activity and on plasma levels of
AngI and AngII, has been measured in normotensive individuals who received a single oral
dose of 20 mg (Nussberger et al., 1992). To compare these data with model predictions, we first
fitted the γACE-I parameter introduced in Eq. (13) to the ACE activity values during enalapril
administration divided by the pre-treatment activity (measured by an antibody-trapping assay). Once γACE-I was set, we used our model to predict the dynamical response of RAS to
this inhibitor drug. The time-dependent values of AngI and AngII concentrations, normalized
by their concentration at time 0, are shown in Figs 2.a-b both for our model predictions and
experimental enalapril data; there is very good agreement between the two curves, without
any further parameter fitting. The excellent correspondence between model prediction and
experimental data is also clear from the root mean square deviation (rmsd) between model
prediction and experimental data on all time points following drug administration, as shown
in Table 1.
Our model, thus, captures the known dynamics of ACE inhibition, (i.e., increased AngI
levels and decreased AngII levels); this has the effect of lowering the concentration of AngII
bound to AT1R and, thus, also lowers the blood pressure (Eq. (12)).
To study the effect of ARB antihypertensive drugs on RAS, we considered data from (Mazzolai et al., 1999), which measures the effects of different types of AT1R blocking molecules
on plasma levels of AngII in normotensive individuals. Specifically, the study participants

Table 1: Comparison between model predictions and experimental values of AngI and AngII
levels normalized by their value before the administration of the drugs. Range is the interval
of experimental values and rmsd is the root mean square deviation between experimental and
predicted values, computed over all time points; Np is the number of time points.
In summary, the rmsd between predicted and experimental values of normalized AngI and
AngII levels, averaged over all tested drugs, dosages, and a total of 38 time points, is 0.57
and 0.18, respectively (Table 1). These values should be compared with average experimental
values of 1.7 and 0.5 respectively, demonstrating excellent agreement between experimental
data and model predictions.
It should be noted that all reported experimental data have been obtained after administration of single doses of RAS-targeting drugs. However, for hypertensive patients receiving
long-term treatment, the expression of some enzymes involved in the RAS system could be
either up- or down-regulated; we will return to this point in the Discussion section.
Finally, we compared model predictions against clinical data from large cohorts of patients
describing the effect of ACE-I and ARB drug administration on blood pressure (Heran et al.,
2008; Doulton et al., 2005). We first analyzed the response to ACE-I drugs alone. We plotted
in Fig 2.c predicted DBP values as a function of γACE-I , as well as measured DBP values
averaged over more than ten ACE-I drug types as a function of the normalized dosage (Heran
et al., 2008). For this, we fixed γACE-I = 0.5 at the maximum dosage and considered a linear
relation between γACE-I and dosage. Note that it would have been possible to introduce additional parameters to define a non-linear relationship between these two quantities and, thus,
obtain a better fit. Despite these simplifications, chosen to limit the number of parameters
to fit, the model curve shows a reasonable fit to the experimental data.
We then studied the effect of the combined administration of the two drugs, ARB and
ACE-I, on blood pressure, plotting the predicted DBP values as a function of both γACE-I
and γARB (see Fig. 2.d). We found that combined administration of ARB and ACE-I reduces
DBP by 4 mmHg when compared with ARB monotherapy, and by 12 mmHg when compared
with ACE-I monotherapy. These predictions should be compared with clinical DBP values
of 3 mmHg for combined administration compared to either monotherapy (Doulton et al.,
2005). Thus, our model again provides an excellent prediction of experimental clinical data;
further improvements to the model’s predictive strength might be possible by fixing the γARB
value at the maximum dose to be slightly lower than the corresponding γACE-I value.

Modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection and ARDS severity
Since ACE2 is the entry point of SARS-CoV-2 (Li et al., 2003), it is downregulated upon
infection, and this impacts substantially on the local and systemic RAS systems. In order to
model the downregulation effect due to the virus, we modified the ACE2 reaction rate with
the function γCoV :
cace2 −→ cace2 × (1 − γCoV (Ct ))

(14)

We chose γCoV to be a sigmoid function of the cycle threshold value Ct , which is inversely
related to the viral load (Borg et al., 2003):
1
(15)
γCoV =
1 + eaCt −b
where a and b are positive real numbers. Ct values of 31.5, 27.6, and 23.8 correspond to mild,
moderate and severe disease, respectively, and Ct > 40 to undetected viral infection (Zheng
et al., 2020). We thus chose the inflection point of the sigmoid at Ct = 31.5 and imposed
γCoV > 0.99 for Ct > 40. Using these relations, we identified the values of the parameters a
and b. They are reported in Table 5, and the sigmoid is represented in Fig. 3.a.
To model ARDS severity and how the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients evolve
in response to RAS dysregulation, we introduced a phenomenological relation to estimate
the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, defined as the ratio between the partial pressure of arterial oxygen
(PaO2) and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). This quantity plays a key role in the
assessment of ARDS patients (Villar et al., 2013; Ware and Matthay, 2000). The normal range
of PaO2/FiO2 is between 400 and 500 mmHg. Mild and moderate ARDS are characterized
by PaO2/FiO2 values in the range [200–300] mmHg and [100-200] mmHg, respectively.
ARDS is severe for values below 100 mmHg.
We predicted the PaO2/FiO2 ratio as a function of the AngII and Ang1-7 concentrations:
PaO2/FiO2 = A0 + A1

[AngII]

−

(16)

where A0 and A1 are two parameters that we identified on the basis of our model by comparing
the baseline RAS with the same system in which ACE2 is knocked out. In the former case we
fixed PaO2/FiO2= 450 mmHg and in the latter PaO2/FiO2= 50 mmHg.

RAS in COVID-19
It is known that ACE2 is the cellular receptor of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou
et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a; Cao et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020), and
that it triggers the entry of SARS-COV-2 into the host cell. Although ACE2 is expressed in a
variety of tissues (Chen et al., 2020a; Xu et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020), it is expressed
mainly in the alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, in the gastrointestinal tract and in the
kidney proximal tubular cells.
Here, we used our model to predict how the RAS system is perturbed by the SARSCoV-2 virus. Simulation results for different AngII and Ang1-7 concentrations, and for the
physiological value of PaO2/FiO2, are presented in Figs 3.b-d and in Table 2.
We observe that the AngII level increases with increasing viral load, with a much stronger
increase for hypertensive than for normotensive patients. The AngII level is predicted to

increase by approximately 15% for patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 (Table 2);
this prediction is in very good agreement with the experimental value of 16% found in (Liu
et al., 2020a), but in poorer agreement with the value of 35% resulting from a study of only
12 patients (Liu et al., 2020b).
We also observe that our model predicts a severe reduction of the Ang1-7 level, due to
ACE2 downregulation; this reduction is the same for hypertensive and normotensive patients.
The overall result of the model is that the RAS system becomes imbalanced upon SARSCoV-2 infection, with the harmful AngII axis upregulated and the counteracting Ang1-7 axis
severely downregulated. This imbalance can be related to multiple clinical manifestations of
COVID-19. More specifically, increased AngII levels cause hyperinflammation which, in turn,
increases plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels (in particular, IL-6) (Merad and Martin,
2020; Satou et al., 2018). In addition, thrombotic events are observed, since AngII promotes the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and tissue-factors (TFs)
(Vaughan et al., 1995; Vaughan, 2005). Ang1-7, which normally counteracts these various
effects (Simões e Silva et al., 2013), is downregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, such that the
COVID-19 clinical manifestations become increasingly severe as the disease develops.
Moreover, our model predicts severe ARDS with PaO2/FiO2<100 mmHg for normotensive and hypertensive patients whose Ct values are smaller than 24.1 and 27.0, respectively.
Our model predicts moderate ARDS, characterized by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio in the range
100-200 mmHg, for normotensive and hypertensive patients having 24.1 < Ct < 29.3 and
27.0 < Ct < 29.7, respectively, and mild ARDS, characterized by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio in the
range 200-300 mmHg for normotensive and hypertensive patients having 29.3 < Ct < 31.4
and 29.7 < Ct < 31.6, respectively.
Our modelling approach suggests a weak relationship between hypertension and ARDS
severity resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean value of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio over
the entire Ct range is approximately 20 mmHg lower for hypertensive than for normotensive
patients. Indeed, the large difference in AngII levels between normotensive and hypertensive
patients is partially compensated by the absence of any difference in Ang1-7 levels.

Model predictions for ACE inhibitors are in agreement with clinical data, which indicate
that treatment with ACE inhibitors is associated with better survival among COVID-19
patients (Mehra et al., 2020; Ssentongo et al., 2020). Indeed, only 3% of non-surviving
COVID-19 patients that were monitored were treated with ACE-I drugs compared to 9% of
surviving COVID-19 patients (Mehra et al., 2020). Moreover, in a meta-analysis (Ssentongo
et al., 2020), hypertensive patients treated with ACE-I drugs were associated with a reduced
mortality of 35% when compared to patients who were not treated with ACE-I drugs. In
another clinical analysis (Khera et al., 2020), older patients who were treated with ACE-I
drugs had a 40% lower risk of hospitalization than those who were not treated with ACE-I
drugs.
No data are currently available to validate our model prediction that COVID-19 disease
attenuation due to ACE-I drug treatment is stronger in hypertensive than in normotensive
patients. Furthermore, no data are currently available to validate our model prediction that
DRI and ACE-I drug treatments cause similar levels of COVID-19 disease attenuation.
In contrast to DRI and ACE-I drugs, our model predicts that ARB drug treatment worsens COVID-19 disease severity, with the effect being stronger for normotensive compared to
hypertensive patients. Here, the agreement between model predictions and clinical data is
less clear, with some clinical data in agreement with our model prediction (Mehra et al., 2020;
Khera et al., 2020), while other clinical data suggest that ARB drug treatment does not affect hospitalization risk (Khera et al., 2020) or mortality (Ssentongo et al., 2020; Baral et al.,
2020). This lack of agreement must be further investigated with additional clinical data.
Moreover, we performed a quantitative prediction of the drug effects on disease severity
by calculating RAS peptide concentrations, PaO2/FiO2 values and DPB of for moderate
COVID-19 patients. Results are presented in Table 3.
Administration of ACE-I drugs, modeled by γACE−I = 0.5, increases the PaO2/FiO2
value by approximately 50 and 70 mmHg for normotensive and hypertensive patients, respectively. An equivalent administration of DRI drugs increases this ratio even more, by 70 and
150 mmHg, while ARB administration decreases it by 140 and 30 mmHg for normotensive
and hypertensive patients, respectively.
The opposite effect of ARBs administration compared to ACE-I and DRI drugs can be
attributed to the substantial increase in AngII concentration, which is only partially balanced
by a relatively small increase in Ang1-7 concentration, given that ACE2 is downregulated in
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Note that a number of ARB drugs, including valsartan and losartan, are currently being
tested in clinical trials, with the hope that they will rescue the RAS system in COVID19 patients (NCT04335786, 2020; NCT04312009, 2020; NCT04311177, 2020). Our model
predicts that this will not be the case.
Finally, as shown in Table 3, the blood pressure is predicted to be unaffected by the administration of either ACE-I, ARB or DRI to normotensive COVID-19 patients, but to be
reduced by approximately 10-20 mmHg by administration to hypertensive patients.
• Other RAS-targeting drugs. We used our model to test the potential of other drugs that
are currently in clinical trials to restore the functional activity of the perturbed RAS system
upon viral infection. First, we modeled how the administration of an exogenous supplement
of rhACE2 (GSK2586881) affects RAS by modifying the reaction rate cace2 defined in Eq.
(14). This rate already includes the function γCoV that mimics SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we

(17)

Our model predicts an increase in PaO2/FiO2 following the administration of exogenous
rhACE2, thus predicting an alleviation of disease severity, as shown in Fig. 5 and Table 3.
Specifically, PaO2/FiO2 is predicted to increase by approximately 200 mmHg when γrhACE2
is fixed to 0.5. Our model also predicts, as expected, a reduction in AngII level and an increase
in Ang1-7 level.
These predictions are in agreement with both animal and in vitro studies (Kuba et al.,
2005; Monteil et al., 2020), whereby rhACE2 is observed to alleviate virus-related ARDS severity through a double action. First, by rhACE2 binding to the virus spike protein, interaction
with endogenous ACE2 is prevented and infection is slowed down. Second, rhACE2 administration increases ACE2 activity, thus causing a reduction in AngII level and an increase in
Ang1-7 level; this protects the lung against severe failure.
Current clinical trial data concerning the administration of different doses of rhACE2 (0.1,
0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg) to SARS-CoV infected patients at different time intervals (2, 4, and 18
h), are only in partial agreement with our model predictions (Khan et al., 2017). Specifically,
while clinical data followed the predicted decrease in [AngII] and the predicted increase in
[Ang1-7], there was no sustained increase in PaO2/FiO2 compared with placebo. It has been
suggested that the drug concentrations used in these clinical trials were too low to have a
measurable effect on the respiratory system and that drug administration via infusion would
have been more sustained (Khan et al., 2017). More experimental and clinical data are clearly
needed to further investigate the effect of rhACE2 on coronavirus-related ARDS.
Another method of boosting the second RAS axis, ACE2/Ang1-7/MAS, which is downregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is to administer Ang1-7 peptides as a means of triggering
anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic mechanisms. We modeled Ang1-7 peptide administration
by introducing a new parameter, the production rate ηAng17 , to the dynamical Eq. (9) of
[Ang1-7]; this allows the model to describe the exogenous Ang1-7 level, which is added to
the endogenous Ang1-7 baseline. As shown in Fig. 5.b and Table 3, our model predicts a
clear alleviation of COVID-19 severity, with PaO2/FiO2 increasing by 50 and 130 mmHg
for hypertensive and normotensive patients, respectively, upon administration of ηAng17 =
25 fmol/(ml min) Ang1-7 in infusion. Note that the COVID-19 alleviation is significantly
stronger in normotensive compared to hypertensive patients for the same drug concentrations;
a slightly stronger concentration of Ang1-7 must be administered to hypertensive patients for
an equivalent effect.
Our model predicts a quantitative reduction in ARDS severity in COVID-19 patients,
in agreement with the known anti-inflammation and anti-fibrosis nature of Ang1-7. Model
predictions nicely agree with data from animal studies without the need of any additional
fitting. For example, administration of Ang1-7 by infusion to acid-injured rats suffering from
ARDS increases baseline Ang1-7 level by a factor 2.5, leading to an increase in PaO2/FiO2
of approximately 70 mmHg (Zambelli et al., 2015). However, while the PaO2/FiO2 value
increases linearly in our model as a function of Ang1-7 concentration, it reaches a plateau
in rats; this suggests that our model is probably oversimplified, since PaO2/FiO2 is not a
linear function of Ang1-7 concentration. Further work on this aspect of our model will be
possible when more data become available.

model’s predictions of changes in COVID-19 severity due to drug administration are blind
predictions, without the fitting of any additional parameters.
Many challenges remain in our current understanding of RAS perturbation in COVID-19
patients. Importantly, more data regarding angiotensin peptide concentrations upon SARSCoV-2 infection are urgently needed, since currently available data are often inconsistent
or conflicting so that reliable comparisons between model predictions and experimental data
cannot be made. Even in healthy individuals, angiotensin peptide levels can vary substantially
due to their low circulating concentrations, the experimental techniques used to measure them,
and interpatient variability.
When developing our model we chose not to consider two enzymes that are active in the
RAS system through the cancellation of their reaction rates: CHY and NEP (see Eqs (18)-(19)).
The CHY enzyme is expressed in mast cells present in interstitial lung connective tissues, and
it cleaves AngI to form AngII. The addition of this enzymatic reaction in the model would not
really influence the predictions since it would essentially be a reparametrization of ACE activity
and of ACE-I action. It might, nevertheless, be interesting to add the CHY enzymatic reaction,
which yields ACE-independent synthesis of AngII and has been suggested (although debated)
to be upregulated in the case of long-term ACE-I administration (Chester and Borland, 2000);
this would enable an explanation of why ACE-I fails to inhibit AngII formation after some
time (Chester and Borland, 2000; Athyros et al., 2007).
The NEP enzyme is expressed in a wide range of tissues, being particularly abundant in
kidney, and it cleaves AngI to form Ang1-7. It influences the counterregulatory RAS axis
through its connection to Ang1-7 levels, thus affecting COVID-19 severity. However, NEP’s
role is far from clear and the literature contains contradictory findings. Experimental data
from rats with ARDS suggest that NEP is severely downregulated in both plasma and lung
tissues (Hashimoto et al., 2010). Note that NEP also cleaves natriuretic peptides, which
have both anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects (Bayes-Genis et al., 2016). Therefore,
the combined administration of NEP-inhibiting and ARB drugs has been suggested to treat
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (Acanfora et al., 2020).
Our future work will include building more complexity into our model by explicitly considering the communication between local and systemic RAS systems (Raizada et al., 1993;
Casarini et al., 2016), and by including the interaction between RAS and the immune system
(Crowley and Rudemiller, 2017). This model extension is necessary for an improved quantitative understanding of RAS system dysregulation upon a variety of perturbations, including
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In summary, our model and its predictions provide a valuable and robust framework for
in silico testing of hypotheses regarding COVID-19 pathogenic mechanisms and the effect of
drugs therapies that are aimed at restoring RAS functionality. Our work also opens a broader
discussion on the role of the full RAS system in COVID-19, a topic that has received little
attention to date, perhaps due to the current focus on the ACE2 enzyme which, although very
important as directly targeted by the virus, constitutes only one part of a much more complex
system.

Materials and Methods
Solving the RAS model
The mathematical model of the RAS system described in Eqs (1)-(11) is a system of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), which are linear except for the feedback loop of Eq. (11).
We collected from the literature the values of the equilibrium concentrations of all proteins and peptides except renin and MAS bound to Ang1-7, for normotensive and hypertensive
humans (Table 4). From these values, we fixed the parameters that appear in the phenomenological relations (12) and (16) for DBP and PaO2/FiO2 (Table 5). We also collected the
values of the half-life of all proteins and peptides but MAS; we assumed the latter to be equal
to that of the other membrane receptors (Table 5). Moreover, we estimated the value of
reaction rate cre from (Versypt et al., 2017; Streatfeild-James et al., 1998).
Using these concentration and parameter values, we solved the system of nine ODEs (Eqs
(1) and (3)-(10)) at the stationary state to identify the unknown parameters and concentrations. However, these equations have 12 unknowns: kagt , β0 , cace , cace2 , cangIV , cat1r , cat2r ,
cmas , cchy , cnep , [RE]0 and [MAS-Ang1-7]0 . We had thus to assume three additional relations,
which are:
cmas = cat2r
cchy = 0
cnep = 0

(18)
(19)
(20)

Since no quantitative data related to the MAS receptor can be found in the literature, we
hypothesized the first relation assuming MAS and AT2R to be equally expressed and the affinity
of Ang1-7 for MAS to be similar to the affinity of AngII for AT2R (Santos et al., 2003). Moreover,
we assumed cchy = 0 and cnep = 0, but discussed the effect of non-vanishing values in the
Discussion section.
By imposing these three additional relations, we solved the system of 9 ODEs at the
stationary state. The values obtained for [RE]0 and [MAS-Ang1-7]0 , kagt , β0 , cace , cace2 , cangIV ,
cat1r and cat2r for normotensive and hypertensive humans are given in Table 4.

Stability of the RAS model
The system of nine ODEs (Eqs (1) and (3)-(10)) can be summarized in the form:
dx(t)
= f (x(t), θ)
(21)
dt
where x(t) is the vector containing the nine state variables, i.e. the concentrations of all
proteins and peptides at time t, θ is the vector with all the production, kinetic and halflive parameters, and f represents the vector that corresponds to the right-hand sides of Eqs
H
(1) and (3)-(10). In order to analyze the stability of the two steady states xN
0 and x0 for
normotensive and hypertensive individuals, respectively, we computed the eigenvalues of the
Jacobian matrix:

In both the normotensive and hypertensive cases, seven strictly negative real values were
obtained, together with two complex conjugate eigenvalues with strictly negative real parts.
H
Both steady-states xN
0 and x0 are therefore stable. The nonzero imaginary parts of the
two complex conjugate eigenvalues are responsible of some damped oscillations in transient
responses to parameter changes, but the overshoots are limited. It is interesting to note that
the imaginary part is more than three times lower in the hypertensive case, hence leading to
more damped responses in comparison with the normotensive case.
To quantify the state variable transients and the aforementioned overshoots, we simulated
step responses corresponding to 10% increase in the normal baseline for renin production β0 .
We observe some damped oscillations during the transient phase of the normotensive case,
with very limited overshoots, e.g. 1.3% for RE concentration. In the hypertensive case, the
imaginary part of the complex conjugate eigenvalues is so low that the overshoots become
almost undetectable (0.025%).
