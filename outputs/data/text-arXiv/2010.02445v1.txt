Abstract. In this article, we review recent lattice calculations on the x-dependence of parton distributions,
with the latter providing information on hadron structure. These calculations are based on matrix elements of boosted hadrons coupled to non-local operators and can be related to the standard, light-cone
distribution functions via an appropriate factorization formalism. There is significant progress in several
directions, including calculations of flavor singlet parton distribution functions (PDFs), first calculations
of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), as well as the implementation of some of the approaches for
the transverse-momentum-dependent PDFs (TMD PDFs). This new direction of lattice calculations is
particularly interesting for phenomenological fits on experimental data sets, as the lattice results can help
to improve the constraints on the distribution functions.

1 Introduction
The quest for an in-depth understanding of hadrons and
their interactions dates back to the mid-20th century. Progress was rapidly made in both the experimental and theoretical frontiers, in particular after the formulation of
QCD, that lead to the systematic and quantitative study
of hadrons and their structure.

H function is known up to next-to-leading order (NLO),
or next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), depending on
the process.
The PDFs, GPDs, and TMD PDFs are light-cone correlation functions and cannot be accessed from the Euclidean formulation of lattice QCD. Partial information
is obtained through the Mellin moments of distribution
functions, and, in principle, one can reconstruct the parton
distributions using an operator product expansion (OPE).
Practically, a proper and exact reconstruction is an impossible task due to the computational challenges to calculate reliably high moments: the signal-to-noise rapidly
decreases, and an unavoidable power-law mixing occurs
beyond the third non-trivial moment.
Alternative approaches to Mellin moments have been
pursued, starting with a method based on the hadronic
tensor [8, 9, 10] already in the 1990’s. Other proposals include auxiliary quark field approaches [11, 12], as well as
methods to obtain high Mellin moments using smeared operators [13]. The development of the quasi-PDFs approach
using Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) has
been a pivot point for calculating x-dependent quantities
from lattice QCD [14, 15, 16]. This approach created an
intense enthusiasm in both the phenomenological and lattice communities, which led to other proposals, such as
the current-current correlators approach [17, 18, 19], the
pseudo-PDFs [20], and a method based on OPE [21].
This article reviews lattice calculations on extracting
the x-dependence of distribution functions utilizing some
of the aforementioned approaches, for which there has
been recent progress. Some of the calculations prior to
2019 can be found in the proceedings of the Lattice Symposium 2018 [22]. An extensive review of the first calculations up to 2018 can be found in Ref. [23]. The main focus
of this review is the presentation of physical results that
are also interesting to the wider theoretical community.
Therefore, the technical details and heavy equations are
avoided, in order to increase readability. However, selected
important technical aspects that affect the reliability of
lattice results are critically discussed. We present calculations that appeared in the literature up to October 1,
2020.
The main part of this article is organized in three sections. Section 2 presents calculations on PDFs, Section 3
on GPDs, and last but not least, Section 4 focuses on TMD
PDFs. Finally, we provide closing remarks in Section 5.

2 PDFs
Most of the information on hadron structure comes from
the intense effort to determine PDFs with quantifiable

and reliable uncertainties. Among the distribution functions, PDFs are the easiest to obtain, as they are onedimensional objects that depend only on the momentum
fraction carried by the partons.
The PDFs are classified as unpolarized (spin-averaged),
helicity (spin-dependent) and transversity (transverse-spindependent), and each can be obtained through the factorization of the cross-section from different high-energy
processes. However, there is still missing information, either because it is challenging to extract certain PDFs, or
because some kinematic regions are not easily accessible.
Therefore, input from lattice QCD is crucial, and lattice
results can either serve as predictions, or as additional
constraints on the phenomenological analyses. In this section, we will discuss the current landscape of lattice results, highlighting their x-dependence in the presentation,
rather technical details.

2.1 Leading-twist PDFs
The non-perturbative part of the cross-section may be expanded in terms of the large energy scale of the process
under study, Q. Taking as an example the unpolarized
PDFs in Eq. (1), one can write the expansion in twist

where fi is the leading-twist (twist-2) contribution, while
(1)
(2)
fi and fi are the twist-3 and twist-4 contributions,
respectively. The leading-twist contributions have probabilistic interpretation, while the higher-twist are sensitive
to the soft dynamics. In most of the studies, the main focus
is on leading twist contributions, which are the easiest to
isolate. While the higher-twist corrections are less-studied,
there is a growing interest including lattice calculations
(See, also, Sec. 2.4).
Progress has been made in several directions, and some
will not be covered in this article due to space limitations.
This includes, but is not limited to, the kaon distribution
amplitude (DA) [24], the feasibility of extracting the xdendendence of PDFs for the ∆+ baryon [25], and exploration of machine-learning methods for the pion and kaon
DAs [26]. We also refer the Reader to a series of papers
on moments of distribution amplitudes for the kaon [27],
the lowest-lying baryon octet [28], and the double parton
distributions of the pion [29]. Preliminary results on the
second moment of the pion DA using heavy quark OPE,
can be found in the proceedings of Ref.[30].
The main effort of lattice calculations up to 2018 was
to obtain x-dependent PDFs directly at the physical point.
Once that was achieved, a shift towards understanding
systematic uncertainties, as well as, using the methodology to extact more complicated quantities has been ob-

served. This change of what is considered a priority in the
field, is reflected in this review.

2.1.1 quasi-PDFs framework
The rapid progress in the field of x-dependent distributions from lattice QCD, became possible with the pioneering work of X. Ji in 2013 [14] on a new approach
to extract PDFs from a Euclidean lattice. While this is
not the first approach to be considered, it clearly renewed
the interest in that direction, and marked the beginning
for a new era in lattice calculations. This approach, the
so-called quasi-distributions approach, demonstrated that
matrix elements of fast-moving hadrons coupled with bilinear non-local operators can be related to light-cone distributions, via a multi-step process. As an example, we
write the matrix element in the forward limit which leads
to PDFs, that is

offers better overlaps with the ground state. Another important development was the proposal 2 for a complete
renormalization scheme [31, 42], which was complemented
by the proof of renormalizability of non-local operators to
all orders in perturbation theory [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. Last
but not least, a well-defined matching prescription appropriate for the various renormalization schemes, has been
developed [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]. All this progress and the
ability to calculate PDFs at the physical point, led to the
need to refine the lattice estimates, with in-depth studies
of various sources of systematic uncertainties.

A thorough investigation of systematic uncertainties
in the unpolarized, helicity and transversity PDFs is presented in Ref. [54]. The focus is on selected sources of systematic effects, as only one ensemble is used. The analysis
is done using an Nf = 2 twisted-mass fermions ensemble with physical pion mass and spatial extent of 4.5 fm
(483 ×96). Using four values of the source-sink separation,
Tsink = 0.75 − 1.13 fm, excited-states effects are addressed
with single-state fits, two-state fits, and the summation
method. The conclusion from this analysis is that lattice
data at Tsink below 1 fm are not sufficient to suppress

systematic uncertainties using simulations at the physical
point. The bands in Fig. 1 include only statistical uncertainties, as the analysis confirms that the effects are either
negligible, e.g., in Z, or require further investigations, such
as, advanced reconstruction techniques.

Finite-volume effects have been studied for the unpolarized and helicity PDFs in Ref. [64]. The calculation uses
a mixed-action setup on three Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 HISQ ensembles, with clover valence fermions. The pion mass of
the ensembles is 220 MeV, and the lattices have spatial
extent L = 2.88, 3.84, and 4.8 fm. The momentum boost
used is 1.3 for all three ensembles, and 2.6 GeV for the
smallest- and largest-volume ensemble. Excited-states effects are quantified using four Tsink values between 0.72
- 1.08 fm, and the final results are presented using twostate fit. The matrix elements at the same P3 from different ensembles, are found to be compatible, indicating that
volume-effects are not significant for mval L ∈ [3.3 − 5.5].
Fig. 2 shows the unpolarized and helicity PDFs using the
L = 2.88 fm and L = 4.8 fm. For both cases, the curves
are compatible for all regions of x. This is in agreement
with the findings of Ref. [54], where the volume effects
were tested on the renormalization functions, and found
small.

Martha Constantinou : The x-dependence of hadronic parton distributions

Ref. [65] presents an analysis of systematic uncertainties also on a mixed action setup of clover fermions in the
valence sector on Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 HISQ fermions with
pion mass 310 MeV. The lattice spacing is 0.042 fm and
L = 2.7 fm. While the physical volume of the ensemble is
small, it is expected to have reduced discretization effects.
As discussed above, there are indications that volume effects are not a major source of systematic uncertainties,
at least for simulations at heavier pion mass. The 2ptfunctions are calculated at 7 values of P3 between 0 and
2.77 GeV, to understand the effect of excited-states contamination, using up to three-state fits. It is found that
as P3 increases, the fits become less reliable and the use
of priors is needed to increase stability. For the 3pt-point
functions, only P3 = 1.84, 2.31 GeV are used and three
values of Tsink = 0.67−0.84 fm. A 3-, 4-, 5-parameter twostate fit is applied, with the difference in the energy between the ground-state and first-excited state determined
independently from the 2pt-functions fits. An agreement
between the three fits is found, however the matrix elements from the 5-parameter fit are a factor of two more
noisy. The renormalized matrix elements are compared in

5

the coordinate space with the estimates from global analyses, as shown in Fig. 3. The real part of the unpolarized
case shows agreement for all z values shown, however, the
errors grow above 50% at around z ∼ 0.6 fm, making
the comparison beyond that point less reliable. The imaginary part has agreement up to z ∼ 0.2 fm, with large
uncertainties for large z values. The real part of the helicity matrix element is in agreement with global fits up to
z ∼ 0.3 fm, while the imaginary part up to z ∼ 0.2 fm.
The large uncertainties and the long tails in the lattice
data for z > 0.6 fm, reveal the challenges of the inverse
problems, as will be discussed below. Implementing a ratio renormalization prescription (pseudo-ITDs), the first
moments of the PDFs are determined. More details can
be found in Ref. [65].
The pion valence PDF of Ref. [67] follows the quasiPDFs approach using a mixed action of clover fermions
in the valence sector and Nf = 2 + 1 HISQ fermions
with pion mass 300 MeV. The volume is 483 × 64, corresponding to a spatial extent of 2.9 fm (a = 0.06 fm).
Three values of P3 are used, namely, 0.86, 1.29, and 1.72
GeV, and there is agreement between P3 = 1.72 GeV and
the phenomenological fits of the JAM Collaboration [68].

increased, and another ensemble with a = 0.04 fm and
spatial extent 2.6 fm is added. The pseudo-ITD approach
(see Sec. 2.1.2) is also explored. To this end, several values of P3 are used, up to 2.15 GeV for the a = 0.06 fm
ensemble, and 2.42 GeV for the 0.04 fm ensemble. Systematic uncertainties related to excited-states contamination

6

using T sink up to 0.72 fm, have been studied. Other systematic uncertainties are investigated related to renormalization, higher-twist effects for low momenta, and study of
the functional form in the large-x region, using data with
z up to 1 fm. The large-x region is of particular interest,
as models predict different behavior of the form (1 − x), or
(1 − x)2 . The valence pion PDF is shown in Fig. 4 for the
two ensembles. The comparison of the lattice data with
other predictions and experimental data shows that there
is agreement in the intermediate-x region. For x > 0.7,
the a = 0.06 fm data are in agreement with the FNAL estimates [69], when systematic uncertainties are included
to the lattice data. Also, it is found that fits of the form
(1 − x)β applied to the lattice data finds β anywhere between [1 - 2], and therefore, there is no clear preference
in one of the two functional forms proposed. Comparison
with other lattice calculations, reveals that the large-x as
obtained from Ref. [72] is in agreement with Ref. [67], but
disagrees with the results of Refs. [73, 74] (see Fig. 9).
Other calculations on quasi-PDFs and comparison with
alternative approaches are presented in Sec. 2.1.2 for the
nucleon and Sec. 2.1.3 for the pion.

2.1.2 pseudo-ITD framework
An alternative framework to quasi-PDFs is the pseudoITDs 3 developed by A. Radyushkin [20, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79,
80,81]. The common feature with quasi-PDFs is the use
of the same matrix elements M of boosted hadrons coupled to non-local operators (Eq. (4)). In the pseudo-ITDs
approach, the analysis uses the Lorentz invariants, z 2 and
ν ≡ −p · z, instead of z and P3 . The variable ν is historically called Ioffe time [82, 83] 4 . In Euclidean space and
based on the conventions we use here, ν = zP3 . M(ν, z 2 )
are called Ioffe-time pseudo-distributions (pseudo-ITDs).
One of the main differences between the quasi- and pseudodistributions formulations is that the former are the Fourier
transform of M(P3 , z) in z, while the latter are the Fourier
transform of M(ν, z 2 ) in ν. Similarly to quasi-distributions,
the pseudo-distributions approach relies on the factorization of pseudo-ITDs obtained on the lattice, to extract the
light-cone ITDs, using a matching kernel calculable in perturbative QCD. The necessary matching is performed at
the level of ITDs [78, 84, 51, 79] in coordinate space, while
in the quasi-PDFs approach is done in the momentum
space.

which are called reduced Ioffe time pseudo-distribution
(pseudo-ITD). Such a ratio is a convenient choice and defines a gauge-invariant renormalization scheme. The renormalization scale in pseudo-ITD is set by 1/z. This consists a major practical difference with the renormalization
prescription of quasi-PDFs, which is based on RI0 -type
schemes [31, 42]. M(ν, z 2 ) also reduces the higher-twist
contamination, as discussed in Ref. [85]. The success of
the approach is based on calculating M(ν, z 2 ) for a wide
range of ν, including small-ν values, by varying either P3 ,
or z, or both. Therefore, physical information is included
in matrix elements from low values of P3 . This is in contrast with the quasi-PDFs, where matrix elements at different P3 are not analyzed together.
The M(ν, z 2 ) are matched to light-cone ITDs, Q(ν, µ2 )
using a matching procedure, and at the same time are
converted to the MS and evolved to a common scale,
µ = 1/z 0 [78, 84, 51, 79]. Finally, the light-cone PDFs are
related to Q(ν, µ2 ) via a Fourier transform in Ioffe time.

Note that this is also subject to the ill-defined inverse
problem. One can utilize the crossing symmetries of the
distributions, which for the unpolarized case, q(x), reads
q̄(x) = −q(−x), where x > 0. The real part of Eq. (8),

to qv2s ≡ qv + 2q̄ = q + q̄, which is the non-singlet distribution involving two flavors. Therefore, the full and seaquark distributions can be extracted by combining the two
equations. Whether this is possible in practice, depends
on the statistical precision of the lattice data. As we will
see below, most of the calculations focus on the valence
distributions, namely, the real part of Q(ν, µ2 ).

The pseudo-ITDs approach has been studied for the
unpolarized PDF for the pion and the nucleon in a series
of publications, with the more recent ones presented in
Refs. [73, 86, 87]. Also, Ref. [88] discusses the challenges
of reconstructing the light-cone distributions from lattice
The analysis within the pseudo-ITDs framework is based data due to the ill-defined inverse problem, and the need
on a ratio of matrix elements, namely
for advanced reconstruction methods. This is relevant for
all methods discussed in this article. Here, we focus on

Martha Constantinou : The x-dependence of hadronic parton distributions

there is some tension for hx2 i using the PDFs lattice estimates for z 2 > 4a2 . A better agreement is observed for the
pseudo-ITDs estimates and NNPDF31 [58]. It was checked
that higher-twist effects are negligible in accordance with
Ref. [85], as there is no dependence of the moments on
z 2 within the reported uncertainties. The pion mass dependence between the 172 MeV and 278 MeV is found to
be within uncertainties. The same holds for the 358 MeV
ensemble, which is, however, much more noisy. Therefore,
non-negligible pion mass dependence between data at the
physical point and at pion mass above 300-350 MeV is not
excluded. Such a dependence was found in Ref. [37]. The
final results use a linear extrapolation applied to the lightest two ensembles, and is compared to the phenomenological fits in Fig. 5. The lattice data are in agreement with
the determinations of Refs. [59, 89, 58] up to x ∼ 0.25.
Beyond that, the lattice results overestimate the global
fits, which is consistent with the tension observed in hx2 i.
This is because the numerical values of high moments receive important contributions from the large-x region. An
in-depth investigation of systematic uncertainties is necessary to address the tension, such as discretization effects
and volume effects, which is a multi-year effort and requires multiple ensembles.

fermions and lattice extent 4.5 fm (483 × 96). Six values
of P3 are used, P3 = 0 − 1.38 GeV, combined with all
possible values of z, so that νmax ∼ 8. Based on the scale
dependence of the reduced pseudo-ITD, it is concluded
that z values up to 8a = 0.75 fm are safe to be used, as
the effect is within the reported uncertainties. An extensive investigations is performed on identifying the optimal
maximum value of ν used to extract the final PDFs. It is
found that νmax = 5.2 (zmax = 0.75 fm) is optimal. One
of the factors to consider is the number of data entering
the reconstruction of PDFs given in Eq. (8). One seeks
for reliable and statistically meaningful results. Three approaches are explored and compared, namely, a discretized
FT, the Backus-Gilbert (BG) [91], and the fitting reconstruction (FR) of Ref. [86]. The latter is implemented using an ansatz that has the proper small- and large-x behavior, inspired by the global fits of experimental data
sets. One of the main differences between the discretized
FT and the other methods, is that the former underestimates the uncertainties, as the uncertainties do not reflect
the lack of data in certain regions of ν. On the contrary,
the BG and FR, have larger uncertainties, which reflects
the challenges of the reconstruction, and the amount of
information in the lattice data. It is found that the fitting
reconstruction performs better than the other approaches,
and is, thus, used in the final analysis, as shown in Fig. 6.
These data correspond to νmax = 5.2 (zmax = 0.75 fm).

Another recent calculation of the isovector unpolarized PDF using the pseudo-ITDs approach is presented
in Ref. [90]. For the first time, the full PDF, q(x) =
qv (x) + q̄(x), and sea-quark PDF, qs (x) = q̄(x), are accessed through the calculation of both the valence, qv ,
and the combination qv + 2q̄. The latter is obtained from
Eq. (10), which is more difficult to extract, as one requires control over statistical uncertainties. One ensemble
at the physical point is used, with Nf = 2 twisted-mass

quasi-PDFs. While this is valid, the agreement observed
between the results using different lattice formulations and
different approaches, suggests that such effects are probably within the reported uncertainties.

The unpolarized PDF is studied with the same ensemble at the physical point using the quasi-PDFs [54] and
the pseudo-ITDs [90] formulation. A near-physical-point
ensemble is also used in Ref. [87], which is used in an extrapolation to the physical point. These three results are
compared in Fig. 7. It should be noted that the results
of Ref. [54] use the standard discretized FT, while the
results of Refs. [87, 90] are obtained with the fitting reconstruction. Also, the pseudo-ITDs analysis utilizes matrix
elements at all values of P3 , as they enter the reduced
pseudo-ITD and the analysis is in terms of ν. This fact,
together with the fitting reconstruction, reduces uncertainties related to the ill-defined inversion problem. Despite the above differences, the results exhibit a very good
agreement. The data from quasi-PDFs have a mild oscillation between x = 0.7 and x = 1, and are slightly above the
results of the other two calculations. This level of agreement suggest that systematic uncertainties related to the
inverse problem, to P3 and the maximum value of zP3 are
within the uncertainties. One can also address the concern
on the renormalization prescription. As mentioned above,
the scheme in pseudo-ITDs is gauge invariant and avoids
the need of an additional renormalization function in an
intermediate RI0 -type scheme prior the matching to the
light-cone PDFs. Furthermore, there are indications that
the RI-type scheme is meaningful in the small-z region,
z = 3 − 4 fm [92]. Therefore, it is expected that there are

Besides the matrix elements of bilinear non-local operators used in the quasi-PDFs and pseudo-ITDs methods,
there is a more general set of hadronic matrix elements,
the good “lattice cross sections” (LCSs). The latter can be
used to extract PDFs, and eventually analyzed together,
in an analogous way as the experimental data [17, 18, 19].
In such global fits of lattice data, systematic effects coming from different results, may have less influence in the
combined PDFs. However, this is an ideal scenario and it
is not clear how systematic uncertainties from each lattice
data will effect the combined fits in practice. Good candidates to construct the set of LCSs share similar features:
a. are calculable in lattice QCD; b. are renormalizable; c.
have the same and factorizable logarithmic collinear divergences as PDFs. As discussed in Ref. [19], both the
quasi-PDFs, pseudo-ITDs fall under the LCSs category.
A useful choice for the operator is a two-current local operator, N J1 (z)J2 (0), with the currents being spacelike separated with distance z. Therefore, this operator
is gauge invariant, without the need of a Wilson line. N
is a dimensionful normalization factor. The matrix elements of such operators (current-current corelators) are
renormalized with the multiplication of the two renormalization functions of the local currents, J1 and J2 . Therefore, the renormalization procedure is easy and uses wellestablished techniques.
A recent work on the pion valence quark distribution
using the current-current correlators method is presented
in Ref. [93]. The calculation is performed on Nf = 2 + 1
clover fermion ensembles with three values of the pion
mass 278, 358, 413 MeV, with two volumes for the heavy
pion mass (3 fm and 4 fm). The vector and axial currents
are used as J1 and J2 , respectively. The momentum boost
employed is between 0.41 - 1.65 GeV. Several values of the
current separation length are used, up to z = 6a = 0.76
fm. As discussed in Ref. [93], the signal decays significantly
with increasing P3 , particularly for mπ = 268 MeV. For
example, for current separation of 3a, the errors are 3
times larger for P3 = 1.65 GeV as compared to P3 = 0.41
GeV. Consequently, the data for source-sink separation
greater than 12a = 1.5 fm and P3 ≥ 1.25 GeV, are not
reliable due to the uncontrolled statistical uncertainties.
This conclusion is compatible with the findings of other
calculations (see, e.g., Sec. 5). Only the lattice data with
signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1 enter the excited-states
analysis. The data from all ensembles are simultaneously
analyzed to obtain the functional form of the ITDs. A chiral, continuum, volume, and higher-twist extrapolation is
employed using the z-expansion, which is frequently used

Martha Constantinou : The x-dependence of hadronic parton distributions

to fit the momentum transferred square, Q2 , dependence
of form factors. We note that three pion masses, two lattice
spacings, and two volumes enter the fit, making the extraction of some of the fit parameters susceptible to systematic
uncertainties. Only z < 0.56 fm < 1/ΛQCD is used in the
final analysis, for which the short-distance factorization
seems to hold, and the higher-twist contributions are suppressed. However, a negligible dependence on z is found
within the reported uncertainties, which is in agreement
with the findings of Refs. [87, 90]. This corroborates the
suggestion that the short-distance factorization (SDF) can
be applied beyond 0.3 − 0.4 fm for the current data, as the
corresponding systematic effects are within the uncertainties. Next-to-leading (NLO) order factorization is applied
to the extrapolated current-current correlators, and are
then parameterized to qvπ (x). Two sets of the parameters
are identified as good estimates. The analysis shows that
larger values of the Ioffe time is needed to better constrain
the fit parameters. Given that the values of z must be in
a perturbative region, one should increase P3 to achieve
higher values of the Ioffe time. As already discussed, increasing P3 while statistical uncertainties are controlled, is
a major challenge of the lattice calculations. The lattice-

future, improved data can potentially be used to identify
the large-x limit.
There is a large number of calculations on the pion distribution using different approaches, lattice formulations,
and analysis. It is, therefore, desirable to compare these
results. Here we show Fig. 9 taken from Ref. [73], in which
four calculations are compared using quasi-PDFs [95, 67],
pseudo-ITDs [73] and current-current correlators [74]. An

extracted qvπ (x) using the two fits are in agreement within
errors, as can be seen in Fig. 8. Given the current uncertainties related to the fit, one could consider as a final fit
the combination of the two bands. The lattice data are
compared with using E156 data [69, 70]. One of the motivations of this work is to identify the large-x behavior
of qvπ (x), and which functional form it favors. The older
analysis of Ref. [69] exhibit a 1 − x fall, while the data of
Ref. [70] have a (1 − x)2 dependence. Based on the current
uncertainties, the lattice data do not favor one over the
other. However, the results are very promising, and, in the

Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 mixed-action ensemble of HISQ/clover
fermions with pion mass of 310 MeV and volume 243 × 64
is used for the calculation of Ref. [95]. The pion PDF is
extracted using the quasi-PDF formulation, and the xdependence reconstruction is performed using the derivative method [56], according to which one neglects the surface term in the integration by parts of the FT. This
method does not solve the inverse problem, as discussed
in Ref. [96]. It also introduces further uncertainties (see
Sec. 3). The results presented in Ref. [67] also employ the
quasi-PDFs method and are discussed in Sec. 2.1.1. Instead of a standard FT, two approaches are tested that
rely on fits applied to the lattice data in the coordinate
space. This is closer to the approach employed in Refs. [74,
73, 93]. The valence pion distribution is shown in Fig. 9.
Note that the various calculations are evolved to different
scales: µ = 2 GeV [73], µ = 3.2 GeV [67], and µ = 4
GeV [95, 74]. However, the scale dependence is expected
to be small within these values. An agreement is observed
between the results of Refs. [67, 74, 73] up to x ∼ 0.5,
and find the distribution to reach its maximum at around
x = 0.3. Note that Ref. [73] combines two Nf = 2 + 1 ensembles with clover fermions reproducing a pion mass of
415 MeV and different volumes, (3 fm and 4 fm). Ref. [74]
uses the same ensemble with 4 fm. Even though the two
calculations are completely independent and do not share

10

any matrix elements, the distribution extracted is in full
agreement. The results of Ref. [67] have a smaller slope
after the peak and approaches x = 1 differently. As mentioned above, a fit on the lattice data is applied to handle
the inverse problem, and the x → 1 limit is one of the
constraints. The results found in Ref. [95] disagree with
the other calculations, as they have a maximum around
x = 0.5, and is higher than the other calculations beyond
x = 0.5. It is possible that the use of the derivative method
contributes to this disagreement.

2.1.4 Hadronic tensor
The hadronic tensor approach was first proposed in the
90’s [8, 9, 10], and was recently revived. The methods discussed above rely on factorization (in momentum or coordinate space) and there is a need for large P3 or large zP3
while ensuring that the values used are within the perturbative region. The hadronic tensor method does not
require large momentum, as it is frame-independence. It
is also free of renormalization. The feasibility of the approach in terms of technical methods can be found in
Ref. [97]. The method relies on analyzing ratios of suitable four-point and two-point functions, which is computationally very challenging, as one has to suppress the
gauge noise and isolate the ground state at the same time.
Another difficulty is the reconstructing of the Minkowski
hadronic tensor, a process that also suffers from the inverse problem. In-depth investigations are needed to identify which methods are promising.
Ref. [97] undertakes such a study using a two ensemble.
A mixed action of clover on DWF with mπ = 370 MeV is
used for the elastic case, W44 . This serves as the benchmark of the approach, as it should give the vector charge.
An anisotropic clover lattice with mπ = 380 MeV is used
to obtain the Euclidean hadronic tensor with nonzero momentum transfer (3.56 GeV), W11 . The inverse Laplace
transform of the Euclidean hadronic tensor is studied with
three methods: the Backus-Gilbert method [91], the maximum entropy method [98], and the Bayesian Reconstruction method [99]. It is found that the vector charge is

reconstructed reliably from W44
, with the maximum entropy method having a better resolution.
The reconstructed Minkowski tensor W11 in shown in
Fig. 10 for the up- and down-quark contributions, as a
function of the energy transfer. Te reconstruction method
used is the maximum entropy method, and the bands represent the uncertainties due to various models. The statistical errors are not considered, possibly because they
would dominate the analysis of the the reconstruction
methods. Note that the momentum transfer 3.56 GeV is
high and the electromagnetic form factors are suppressed.
Therefore there is no peak around ν = 0, which is the
elastic point. There is a peak around ν = 1 GeV, which is
below the range leading to the parton structure functions
(ν ∈ [2.96 − 3.68] GeV). The same conclusions are found
with the Backus Gilbert method. This is a on-going effort,

and improvements are needed in several directions. The
ultimate goal is to obtain lattice data for the Minkowski
hadronic tensor for a wide set of kinematic setups, which
can be used to extract x-dependent PDFs via a factorization theorem.

2.1.5 OPE without OPE
Another method to access hadronic distributions was proposed recently in Ref. [21]. It is known as “OPE without
OPE”, as it is related to the work of G. Martinelli [100].
Based on this approach, one computes matrix elements of
the time-ordered product of two local currents,
Mµν (p, s, s0 , z) = hp, s0 | T {Jµ (z), Jν (0)} |p, si .

(11)

The currents are separated by a distance z, which has to
be small for perturbation theory to be applicable. There
is also a lower limit for z for discretization effects to be
under control. The Compton tensor

can be decomposed into two scalar functions F1,2 (ω, Q2 ),
which are related to the DIS structure functions F1,2 from
the hadronic tensor decomposition, via the optical theorem:

Martha Constantinou : The x-dependence of hadronic parton distributions

The method has been recently studied in Ref. [101]
using one Nf = 2+1 ensemble of clover fermions with pion
mass 467 MeV and L = 2.4 fm (a = 0.074 fm). The matrix
element of the current-current operator is computed using
the Feynman-Hellmann relation [102], which avoids the
computation of four-point functions. This method requires
an additional term in the QCD Lagrangian

where ef is the electric charge of the f th flavor and λ is a

of the nucleon energy with respect to λ, that is

2.2 Flavor decomposition of PDFs
One of the recent highlights is the calculation of disconnected contributions of matrix elements of non-local operators, which have been analyzed within the quasi-PDFs
framework. This is an important direction, as some of
the PDFs are not well-constrained from global analyses.
For example, most of the high-energy processes are not
sensitive to the strangeness. Therefore, it is difficult to

11

disentangle the strange-quark PDF from the down-quark
PDF. This results in large ambiguities in its extraction,
and, for example, global analysis of DIS + SIDIS data
sets gives different sign for ∆s for different fragmentation
functions [103, 104]. This poses limitations on the reliable
extraction of the W -boson mass and the determination
of the CKM matrix element Vcs [105, 106]. Thus, the lattice calculations are quite timely, and while preliminary,
demonstrate their potential. To date, there are only 2 calculations at higher-than-the-physical pion mass, which we
briefly summarize here [107, 108]. Both calculations apply
the non-singlet renormalization functions calculated nonperturbatively, and the mixing with the gluon PDFs has
been neglected. It should be noted that, this mixing arises
at the matching level, and not at renormalization, because
there is no additional non-local ultraviolet divergence in
the quasi-PDF [109, 47, 110]. The effects from neglecting
both the singlet renormalization and the mixing are expected to be within the uncertainties reported in the calculations.
Ref. [107] presents the strange and charm unpolarized
PDFs using an Nf = 2+1+1 ensemble with mixed fermion
action (clover on HISQ) with volume 243 × 64 (∼3 fm).
The nucleon is boosted with momentum up to P3 = 2.18
GeV. Two values of the valence pion mass are used, that is
310 and 690 MeV, on which a 2-parameter chiral extrapolation is performed, making it less reliable. Also, unlike
the 2-parameter fit applied in Ref. [87], here the lightest
ensemble is above 300 MeV, possibly not capturing properly the pion mass dependence near the physical point.

is nonzero, and in agreement with CT18 up to zP3 =
12π/24 ∼ 1.6, and with the less-accurate NNPDF31 up
to zP3 = 18π/24 ∼ 2.4. The data shown correspond
to {n3 , zmax } = {1, 6a}, {2, 6a}, {3, 6a}, {4, 4a}, {5, 3a},
where aP3 = n3 × 2π/24, and zmax is the maximum value
of z used (a = 0.12 fm). As can be seen, the lattice data
for P3 = 1.75 and 2.18 GeV are very noisy, and thus not
very useful. Such rapid decrease of the signal with increase
of the momentum boost has been discussed by various
groups (see, e.g., Refs. [54, 93, 72]). In general, the lattice
data have flat behavior, which is not supported by the
global fits, demonstrating a tension of a factor of 2 for the
large values of zP3 . It is assumed that this is due to not
taking into account the other flavors in the matching [107].

2.3 Gluon PDFs
The flavor decomposition of the up- and down-quark
PDFs requires the calculation of both the connected and
quark disconnected diagram. The disconnected u + d was
not calculated until recently, preventing lattice calculations to provide the individual quark PDFs. Such a decomposition is presented for the helicity PDFs, ∆u, ∆d,
in Ref. [108]. ∆s is also presented, which is not combined
with the light-quark PDFs, as the mixing with the gluon
PDFs is not considered. The calculation is performed using one ensemble of Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 twisted mass fermions,
at pion mass 260 MeV, and volume of 3 fm (323 × 64).
Three values of P3 are used, with the highest being 1.24
GeV. Convergence between P3 = 0.83 GeV and P3 = 1.24
GeV is observed within the reported uncertainties. Hierarchical probing [111] is used together with momentum
smearing, which successfully improves the signal.
The final PDFs, x∆+
q ≡ x∆q + x∆q̄, are shown in
Fig. 13 for the three flavors, and are compared to the latest global fits of the JAM Collaboration (JAM17) [62].
Despite neglecting the mixing with the gluon PDFs, the
agreement between the lattice results and global fits is
very encouraging. x∆+
u exhibits an agreement up to x ∼
0.65, while x∆+
d is in full agreement for all x regions. The
statistical uncertainties of the lattice data for the lightquark PDFs are comparable to the uncertainties of the
global fits. The most striking case, is that of x∆+
s , for
which the lattice data exhibit smaller statistical uncertainties than JAM17 for x < 0.6, and both data are compatible within uncertainties for the whole x-region. We remind
the Reader that the comparison is qualitative, as a thorough investigation of systematic uncertainties is needed,
and the elimination of the mixing with the gluon PDFs.

The formalism to extract the x-dependence of quark distributions is also applicable for gluons PDFs. This has already been discuss in several papers for the quasi-PDFs [49,
46, 47, 48, 110], pseudo-ITDs [112], and current-current correlators [19] methods. Ab initio calculations of gluon PDFs
is a new direction and largely unexplored. However, it is
an essential one because gluonic contributions are sizeable, for example in the proton spin [113, 114, 115, 116,
117]. Global analysis find that gluon PDFs are dominant
in the production of Higgs boson and heavy quarkonium [118,
119, 59, 120, 57, 58, 66, 121]. In fact, the recent analyses constrained better the small-x region, using recent data on
the tt̄-quark data at the LHC [122, 123, 124] and Tevatron [125], as well as the HERA run I+II data [126]. The
domination of gluon PDFs over quark PDFs, especially in
the small-x region is a testament of the non-perturbative
QCD dynamics responsible for the rich and complex structure of hadrons. Besides their essential role in the hadron
structure, calculations of gluon PDFs serve another important purpose: they are necessary to eliminate the mixing with the quark singlet PDFs [127]. Disentanglement
of the gluon and quark singlet PDFs will eliminate one of
the sources of systematic uncertainties in lattice calculations. For the case of Mellin moments of PDFs, the mixing appears in the renormalization. However, as discussed
above, the non-local operators are multiplicatively renormalizable 5 . The mixing between the flavor-singlet quark
5
This is not generally true for all gluon operators, as some
choices mix under renormalization and should be avoided [47,
48].

and gluon PDFs should be eliminated at the factorization
level.

2.0

A preliminary calculation of matrix elements of nonlocal gluonic operators is presented in Ref. [128]. A mixed
action is used with pion mass 330 MeV for the sea sector,
and volume 2.7 fm (243 × 64). The valence sector reproduces a pion mass of 340 and 678 MeV. The nucleon is
boosted with P3 = 0.46, 0.92 GeV. One of the operators
employed exhibits mixing with other gluonic operatros under renormalization, in addition to the mixing with the
quark singlet PDFs. Also, the calculation lacks renormalization, and instead, the matrix elements are normalized.
Such a normalization changes the quantity under study,
and the matching kernel of quasi-PDFs is not applicable.
Therefore, only matrix elements are extracted, demonstrating the challenges of the calculation: for mπ = 678
MeV at P3 = 0.92 GeV the noise exceeds 40% of the signal beyond z = 3a, while for mπ = 340 MeV the noise is
40% already at z = 0 and the signal is lost at z = 4a.

The most-well studied structure function is the transverse spin dependent g2s.f. [138], from which one can separate the non-perturbative component, the intrinsic gT
PDF. The properties of g2s.f. in DIS were first studied by
Wandzura and Wilczek [139], proposing the WandzuraWilczek (WW) approximation. In their model calculation,
it is suggested that the Mellin moments of gT (x) receive
contributions from twist-2 operators and twist-3 operators, allowing one to write

where
the contribution from twist-3 operators [140].
In the WW approximation 6 , the moments of twist-3 operators vanish, and thus, gT (x) is determined only by the
twist-2 operator of the helicity PDF g1 (x). The validity
of the WW-approximation has been under investigation
since its proposal. In Ref. [140] the WW approximation
was tested using experimental data, leading to possible
violation at the level of 15 − 40%.
The field of extracting the x-dependence of PDFs using the methodologies outlined in Sec. 2 has reached sufficient maturity that enables the study of twist-3 PDFs
and their properties. To date, there is only one lattice calculation 7 on twist-3 PDFs, in particular, on gT (x) presented in Ref. [143]. The calculation is performed using
Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 twisted mass fermions at a pion mass of
260 MeV, and employing the quasi-PDFs method. The relevant matrix element is hP | ψ(0, z) γ j γ 5 W (z) ψ(0, 0) |P i,
where j is in one of the transverse directions. The maximum proton momentum boost used is P3 = 1.67 GeV. The
necessary matching was calculated in [144], demonstrating that the twist-3 light-cone PDFs and their quasi-PDF
counterparts have the same infrared physics, as in the case
of all twist-2 PDFs. It was also shown that there are no
zero-mode contributions. An extension of this work to the
twist-3 e(x) and hL (x) PDFs, has shown that the singular
zero-mode contributions cannot be avoided, making the
extraction of their matching more complicated [145]. The
lattice data on g1 (x) have been used to test the WW approximation, which suggests that it fully defines gT (x),

be seen, the lattice gT (x) is consistent with the lattice
gTWW (x) for x ≤ 0.5. However, not all sources of systematic uncertainties have been accounted for, and thus, a
violation of the WW approximation is still possible at
the level of up to 40% for x . 0.4, which is similar to
the one found using experimental data [140]. The comparison is, of course, qualitative, as simulations at the
physical pion mass and investigation of systematic uncertainties is essential. It should also be noted that there is
mixing between the intrinsic and dynamical twist-3 operators, which should also be dealt at the matching level,
as discussed above for the gluon and singlet quark PDFs.
However, twist-3 is a completely unexplored area for the
quasi-PDFs approach. While a lot of work is needed in the
direction of twist-3 PDFs, the work of Refs. [143, 144, 145]
demonstrate the feasibility of lattice calculations and the
matching formulation.

2.5 Other developments
In parallel to improving the numerical calculations, there
have been interesting developments in a more theoretical
direction, and here we discuss a few of them.
Some of the highlights regarding the matching formalism are the calculations presented in Refs. [146, 147, 148,
149], which extend the matching kernels to next-to-nextto-leading order (NNLO). In practice, this means twoloop calculations with respect to the strong coupling constant. It has been discussed extensively that, the truncation of the matching formula to NLO consists one of
the major sources of systematic uncertainties. Therefore,
this is an important development. In particular, the flavor
non-diagonal quark-quark channel in the modified minimal subtraction scheme for the quasi-PDFs is discussed
in Refs. [146, 147]. The NNLO matching for the valence

Martha Constantinou : The x-dependence of hadronic parton distributions

As discussed in previous subsections, there are restrictions in the z-range so that factorization is applicable,
and this also concerns the renormalization. In an RI-type
scheme, for example, there could be non-perturbative effects in the large-z region through logarithms, such as
log(z 2 µ2 ). The pseudo-ITDs ratio which is a renormalization scheme, could also hinder higher-twist effects in
large z. However, both the RI-type and ratio schemes are
suitable to remove all divergence for small and intermediate values of z. This consists the main motivation of
Ref. [92], proposing a hybrid renormalization, which treats
the short-distance and long-distance renormalization separately. This consists of using an RI-type, or ratio scheme
up to some zmax , and a mass-subtraction scheme for the z
beyond zmax . At zmax , the renormalization functions from
the two schemes should be the same based on continuity
arguments. It is estimated that an upper limit for zmax is
around 0.4 fm. It is possible that this constrain for zmax is
beyond the current precision level of state-of-the-art calculations. For example, the agreement observed in Fig. 7 and
Fig. 9 between lattice data from different lattice actions
and renormalization schemes, does not indicate large effect from treating renormalization differently. The validity
of extrapolating the lattice data based on the asymptotic
long-range Regge-type behavior [150] is also presented.
This type of fits are also used in the pseudo-ITDs and

discussed here. The work of Ref. [151] generalizes Collins’
work [155] to off-light-cone matrix elements for leading
twist and found that quasi-PDFs and pseudo-PDFs are
equivalent. These, as well as their light-cone counterparts
are renormalizable. It is also demonstrated that factorization exists at small z, large P3 and small flow times. Yet
again, the claims of Refs. [152, 153] have been proven invalid. Light-cone PDFs can indeed be accessed properly
via the methods discussed in this review, as well as other.

2.6 Synergy of lattice QCD and global fits
Recently, there has been an interest from the phenomenological community to incorporate lattice data in the global
analyses, in the same fashion as the experimental data
sets. The main motivation is to explore whether the PDFs
can be constrained more successfully, in regions where the
experimental data are either sparse, imprecise, or nonexisting.

Therefore, the lattice matrix elements can be analyzed
within the framework applied on experimental data sets.
The procedure is based on finding a χ2 -function, which
is minimized in order to extract V3 and T3 . Quantifying statistical and systematic uncertainties is important
in this process. Six plausible scenarios are considered to
assess systematic uncertainties that are not known, focus
on the two realistic ones, labeled S2 and S5. Scenario S2
(S5) attributes 20%, 5%, 10%, 20% (0.2, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) for
cut-off effects, finite-volume effects, excited-states contamination, and truncation of perturbative expansion, respectively. Note that the systematic uncertainties in S2 change
with z, while they are fixed in S5. The analysis of lattice
data including these systematic effects is shown in Fig. 16,
and are compared to the phenomenological fits NNPDF31.
It is observed that the more conservative scenario S2 leads
to larger uncertainties, and is marginally compatible with
the global analysis estimate at most regions of x. This
analysis emphasizes the importance of properly quantifying systematic uncertainties in lattice estimates.
Ref. [157] presents a combined Monte Carlo based QCD
global analysis within the JAM framework for both the
unpolarized and helicity PDFs. The lattice data of Refs. [37,
54] are treated under the same conditions as the experimental data sets from unpolarized and polarized DIS and
Drell-Yan (note this is not the same as the JAM17 results [62]). The analysis uses the Monte Carlo Bayesian
inference sampling methodology, parametrizing the PDFs
at the input scale µ, and solving the evolution equations
in Mellin space to bring all the observables at the same
scale. In a nutshell, the analysis shows a rather weak constraint from the lattice data on the phenomenological unpolarized PDFs. This behavior is in agreement with the
findings of Ref. [156]. In contrast, the lattice data on the
helicity PDFs provide significant constraints to the combined estimates, as can be seen in Fig. 17. It is found that
the combined estimates of the quark PDFs have reduced
uncertainties by a factor of 3 in the small- and large-x
regions, and a factor of 5 in the intermediate-x regions.
The anti-quark isovector helicity PDF exhibits an equally
large improvement. It is also interesting that the combined fit (“exp+lat”) is compatible with the discretized
FT (“DFT”) of Refs. [37, 54]. It should be noted that the
implementation of the lattice data is done at the level
of the renormalized matrix elements in coordinate space.

Therefore, the challenges of the inverse problem do not appear directly in this analysis, as the discretized lattice data
are fitted within the JAM framework. However, the effectiveness of such fits are driven by the number and quality of the lattice data. As mentioned previously, properly
quantifying both statistical and systematic uncertainties
is crucial.

Based on the analyses of Refs. [156, 157], one can conclude that the current precision of the lattice data on the
unpolarized case must improve significantly to reach the
quality of the experimental data. The case of the helicity
PDFs is more promising, as the independent analysis of
Refs. [37, 54] shows a very good agreement with the global
fits, for a wide range of x. In fact, the lattice data compare
favorably with the experimental data sets, and demonstrate a great constraining power, as shown in Fig. 17.
The work of Refs. [156, 157] opens up new possibilities for
synergy between lattice QCD and global QCD fits. It is
expected that, in the near future, combined analysis of
multiple factorizable lattice matrix elements from various
approaches will be available, an idea already discussed in
Refs. [17, 19]. Ref. [151] proposes a framework of a global
analysis of lattice data.

There are a number of challenges in extracting GPDs
from experimental data, as the latter are limited, and
cover a small kinematic region. Not only these data sets
are indirectly related to GPDs through the Compton form
factors, but it is very difficult to disentangle the GPDs entering the same high-energy process [158, 159, 160, 161].
The x-dependence of GPDs for fixed values of t and ξ,
can be accessed using the methods developed for PDFs.
This new direction has recently been explored using the
quasi-PDFs method in Refs. [162, 163] 8 The possibility to
access GPDs through the pseudo-GPDs method has also
been proposed [80], but yet to be implemented in lattice
calculations.
The connected contribution for the pion GPD, Hvπ ,
is presented in Ref. [162]. The motivation is to study the
large-x behaviour and test which parameterization of kinematic dependence of the GPD is preferable [165, 166]. The
calculation is performed using an Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 mixedaction ensemble of HISQ/clover fermions with pion mass
of 310 MeV and volume 243 × 64. Only zero skewness
is considered in the calculation, and two values of the
momentum transfer, that is −t ∼ 0.40, 0.92 GeV2 . Since
there is only one GPD for the pion, one avoids the complications of disentangling GPDs, and the need for more
than one independent matrix elements to achieve the isolation. As a consequence, the calculation of the pion GPDs
is computationally less expensive than the nucleon ones.
The derivative method is employed, according to which
one neglects the surface term in the integration by parts of
the FT. This process is controlled only if the renormalized
matrix elements decay to zero. Another concern about this
method is that the surface term contains a factor of 1/x,

work is shown in Fig. 18 for the pion PDF, and GPD for
−t ∼ 0.40, 0.92 GeV2 at P3 = 1.74 GeV. Meson-mass corrections have also been applied. One observes that as t increases, the GPD decreases in magnitude. It is concluded
that the accuracy of these results is not sufficient to favor
one of the two parameterizations, and further studies are
necessary.
The isovector unpolarized and helicity GPDs for the

proton, H(x, ξ, t), E(x, ξ, t) and H(x,
ξ, t), E(x,
been studied using an Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 ensemble of the
twisted mass formulation [163]. The ensemble has volume
323 × 64 and pion mass 260 MeV. Both zero and nonzero
skewness (ξ = ±1/3) have been studied, for P3 up to 1.67
GeV, and −t = 0.69, 1.39 GeV2 . As these are discretized
on the lattice, specific combinations of the above values of
P3 , ξ, t have been obtained. Note that the skewness defined in the lattice calculation (quasi-skewness) is defined

as ξ = − 2P
and defers to the light-cone ξ in power cor3
rections. As mentioned above, extracting nucleon GPDs
is computationally very costly. In addition, one requires a
sophisticated analysis to properly disentangle the GPDs,
as each matrix elements contributes, in general, to more
than one GPDs. 9 For example, the off-forward proton

The work presented in Ref. [164] does not calculate the matrix element in the symmetric (Breit) frame, which is necessary
to obtain the standard, frame-dependent GPDs. See discussion

where Q ≡ Pf − Pi , and hhΓ ii ≡ ūN (Pf , s0 ) Γ uN (Pi , s)
with uN the proton spinors. Therefore, a minimum of two
parity projectors are needed, leading to two independent
matrix elements, in order to disentangle FH and FE . Another critical aspect of the calculation of GPDs is the
need for implementation of the Breit (symmetric) frame.
In this setup, both the momentum of the initial and final states, Pi , Pf carry half of the momentum transfer,
~
~
that is P~i = P3 ẑ − Q/2
and P~f = P3 ẑ + Q/2.
This has
major implications in the computational cost, as separate
calculations are needed for every value of t, because both
the source and sink momenta change. We emphasize that
there is a fundamental difference between the calculation
of Mellin moments of GPDs (form factors and generalized form factors) and the light-cone GPDs. The former
are frame independent, and one can extract them in a
more convenient frame, that is, fix the sink momentum
~
and attribute t to the source (P~f = P3 ẑ, P~i = P3 ẑ − Q).
However, the light-cone GPDs are frame dependent, and
their standard definition is in the symmetric frame. The
connection between different frames is not a simple kinematical one, and therefore, the lattice calculations must
be performed in the frame where GPDs are defined. Introducing momentum transfer in the matrix element, coupled
to the momentum boost of the proton states, increases
significantly the statistical noise. Another complication of
t 6= 0 is related to the momentum smearing method, which
is necessary to suppress the statistical uncertainties. As
pointed out in Ref. [40], the exponent of the momentum
smearing phase must be parallel to the proton momentum to ensure overlap with the ground state. Therefore,
all ingredients of the optimized ratio between 3pt- and
2pt-correlation functions (see, e.g., Eq. (S4) of the supplementary document of Ref. [163]) requires a separate
momentum smearing.

Figs. 19 - 20 show H(x, ξ, t) and H(x,
ξ, t) at P3 = 1.25
GeV, for which both zero and nonzero skewness are available. Each is compared to the corresponding PDF, f1 (x)
and g1 (x), respectively. As can be seen, there is a qualitative difference between the GPDs at zero and nonzero
skewness. Let us remind the Reader that this mean zero
and nonzero momentum transfer in the direction of the
boost. In the latter case, the x-range separates into two
kinematic regions, the ERBL (|x| < ξ), and the DGLAP
region (|x| > ξ), which have different physical interpretation [167]. From the practical standpoint, the matching for ξ 6= 0 becomes more complicated than the one for
ξ = 0, with the latter being the same as for the PDFs [168].
The PDFs are more dominant, as the probability of finding quarks with t 6= 0 decreases with increase of t. For
the unpolarized case, we can compare the lattice data in
the DGLAP region with the power-counting analysis of
Ref. [169] at the x → 1 limit. One of the predictions of

this analysis is that H(x, ξ = 0, t) approaches f1 (x), which
is confirmed by the lattice data. It also predicts that at
x → 1 the t-dependence vanishes, which is also observed

by the lattice data. For results on the E-GPD and E-GPD,

4 TMD PDFs
To map the three-dimensional structure of hadrons, knowledge of TMD PDFs is necessary, as it provides information
not only on the longitudinal momentum, but also on the
transverse momentum of partons. TMD PDFs arise in processes that involve multiple kinematic scales, such as DrellYan, e+ e− annihilation, and semi-inclusive deep inelastic

Martha Constantinou : The x-dependence of hadronic parton distributions

scattering. Consequently, a more complicated factorization formalism is required. For instance, the differential
cross section is sensitive to the small transverse momenta,
for which the non-perturbative dynamics cannot be neglected. Thus, the TMD PDFs contain the small transverse momenta information, making them more detailed
than collinear PDFs.
The TMD factorization of the singular cross-section is
not unique, and the various schemes are related to each
other. The original proposal for TMD PDFs by Collins,
Soper and Sterman [170, 171, 172] is such that the hard
factor is absorbed in the definition of TMDs. In the revised definition for the TMD factorization [173], the TMD
PDFs have two components: the beam function (one for
each incoming hadron) and the soft function. The former
describes collinear radiation near the hadron, and is defined via matrix elements of non-local operators containing a staple-shaped Wilson line. The latter encodes the
soft-gluon effects between the partons. The soft function
contains little physical information on incoming hadrons,
but has a practical importance: it cancels the rapidity
renormalization scale in the beam function. A combination of the two components is necessary to extract the
TMDs. It should be noted that both the beam function
and the soft function are calculable in lattice QCD.
There have been extensive discussions within the phenomenological community on the factorization related to
TMD PDFs and their definitions (see, e.g., Ref. [174]). Recently, such discussions became relevant within the lattice
QCD community, due to the increased interest to generalize methods initially developed for PDFs, to access TMD
PDFs. Lattice calculations of matrix elements with nonlocal operators related to TMDs, their renormalization,
and the soft function, have recently emerged. However, the
field is still at its infancy, and a lot of progress is required.
In this article, we briefly summarize the latest progress,
most of which is on the theoretical side. More details on
the first explorations of TMDs from lattice QCD [175, 176,
177,178, 179, 180, 181] can be found in Ref. [182]. The most
recent studies that are discussed here, can also be found
in Refs. [16, 182].

A prescription to obtain the Collins-Soper evolution
kernel non-perturbatively from ratios of quasi-TMDs formed
at different momenta, is given in Ref. [185]. Ref. [186]
presents a study of quasi-TMD PDFs and ratios of impactparameter quasi-TMDs, which can be matched to their
light-cone counterparts. In addition, the appropriate matching formula is discussed. Ref. [187] presents a renormalization prescription and matching of quasi-TMDs as defined
in Ref. [186]. A matching kernel of ratios of TMDs for
different spin structures is proposed in Ref. [191].
The methodology proposed in Refs. [185, 186, 187] was
implemented numerically in Ref. [192] for the renormalization using the gradient flow method, and in Ref. [193]
for the Collins-Soper kernel. The calculation is performed
in quenched LQCD with pion mass of 1.207 GeV. The
hadron is boosted with P3 = 1.29, 1.94, 2.58 GeV and
for transverse parton momentum qT in the range of 250
MeV and 2 GeV. The staple extent, η, is chosen 0.6, 0.7
and 0.8 fm, while the asymmetry in the staple, bT , is between −(η − a) and (η − a), with a = 0.06 fm. The extracted Collins-Soper kernel is shown in Fig. 21, together
with results from perturbation theory. An agreement is
observed only around bT ∼ 0.2 − 0.3 fm. This indicades
non-negligible systematic effects in the lattice data, such
as power corrections in the small-bT region. The challenges
of the inverse problem arise in these calculations too, as
the Fourier transform over bT is required. A way to perform the Fourier transform with limited data is to apply
fits on the lattice data, as performed in Ref. [193]. However, an extensive study of the systematic uncertainties is
necessary to control unwanted effects.

The light-cone TMD PDFs involve matrix elements of
non-local operators containing a staple-shaped Wilson line.
The latter are infinite and their edges are on, or near the
light-cone. Therefore, they cannot be accessed directly in
lattice QCD. A way around this issue, is to calculate correlation functions with space-like separated partons, as
done for PDFs and GPDs, and then properly match them
to their light-cone counterparts. The quasi-distributions
approach is the first to be explored for TMDs, and recent
work can be found in Refs. [183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189,

of the findings is that the soft function can be defined
as the form factor of a pair of color sources traveling at
almost the speed of lights, and can be calculated using
lattice Heavy-Quark Effective Theory (HQET). However,
this is of little practical use for lattice calculations. An alternative proposal is to extract the soft function through
the factorization of a fast-moving light-meson form factor, which can be combined with the quasi-TMD wavefunction. In the follow-up calculation of Ref. [189], the
matching kernel is extracted, based on the definition of
Ref. [188]. Ref. [196] presents a lattice calculation of the
rapidity-independent part of soft function presented in the
transverse coordinate space, indicated as b⊥ . The calculation is performed using one Nf = 2 + 1 CLS ensemble of
clover fermions with pion mass 333 MeV in the sea sector
and 547 MeV in the valence sector. The momentum boost
is up to 2.1 GeV. The final results for the two ensembles
are shown in Fig. 22, and are compared with perturbative
results, as well as the results from Ref. [193]. We note that
the comparison is qualitative, as the latter calculation is
quenched, and at a very heavy pion mass. This has the
benefits of small statistical uncertainties. An agreement
is observed between the various lattice results, within the
errors. The results of Ref. [196] are compatible with the
3-loop perturbative results up to bT ∼ 0.4 fm.

5 Closing Remarks
The work presented in this review is a demonstration of
the advancement of lattice QCD in novel methods of obtaining PDFs, GPDs and TMD PDFs that, only a decade
ago, were considered impossible to calculate “directly”.
In particular, we have demonstrated that calculations of

PDFs have reached an advanced level, with dedicated studies of various sources of systematic uncertainties. Given
the progress, it is possible that precision calculations with
controlled uncertainties will be available in the next few
years. Gluon PDFs and flavor-singlet quark PDFs are actively being pursued with very promising results. This direction progresses more slowly than the non-singlet PDFs,
as the calculation of disconnected contributions of nonlocal operators and boosted hadrons are computationally
very challenging. The natural extension of the methods
to access x-dependent distribution functions, is studies of
GPDs. Interestingly, only exploratory studies are available, providing the x-dependence of GPDs for selected values of the momentum transfer at zero skewness, or limited
values of nonzero skewness. This is due to the fact that
the introduction of momentum transfer comes with several
complications, most of them computational. The above
make the computation of GPDs much more challenging
than the form factors, due to the frame-dependence of
the former. Serious effort is invested in studies of TMD
PDFs, with most of the work being on theoretical developments. The lattice calculations are still very preliminary,
and some of them at very heavy pion mass. A lot more
numerical explorations are expected to follow.
As concluded from the main text, the various methods
to access x-dependent distribution functions are based on
different theoretical formulations and are susceptible to
different systematic uncertainties. Regardless, all methods
pursue the same physical quantities, even though the factorization procedure is realized differently. Some methods
rely directly on large hadron momentum, P3 , and others
on large Ioffe time, zP3 . Regardless on the classification
of the factorization (LaMET, or short-distance), the calculations of matrix elements with boosted hadrons and
non-local operators are computationally intensive. It is
apparent that there are limitations to the value of P3 due
to the computational cost and the value of a. For coordinate space factorization, there are also limitations on
z, which has to be small and within the perturbative region. Since there is a need for large P3 , or large zP3 , it
is undoubtedly desirable to explore what the current capabilities of the lattice calculations are. Often, there is
the misconception that large momentum can be achieved
with controlled uncertainties. Instead of making assumptions based on phenomenological models or otherwise, we
take a close look at the current calculations to address the
question whether it is feasible to reach high momentum
without compromising the reliability of the results. Such
a question becomes more pressing for simulations near or
at the physical point.

the nucleon. The main focus is on the noise-to-signal ran

s
the real part of the matrix elements the peak is at z = 0,
while for the imaginary part is at some intermediate value
of z depending on the quantity under study. As most cal-

culations include multiple values of P3 , we present
at
s
the highest P3 , which will provide some indication of the
challenges to increase P3 for non-local operators. It should
be emphasized that the noise-to-signal percentages should
not be directly compared between methods, as the focus of
each approach is different. For example, the pseudo-PDF
method and current-current correlators method utilize all
values of P3 , while for the quasi-PDFs analysis, one uses
the data at the highest possible momentum. Therefore,
the control of statistical uncertainties in the former methods can and is achieved at low momenta. For example, if
one would analyze the data of Ref. [87] within the quasiPDFs method, the maximum momentum which leads to
reliable renormalized results for a wide range of z values is
P3 ∼ 1.3 GeV for the 172 MeV ensemble. However, the results at P3 = 2.1 GeV are accurate enough for small values
of z within the pseudo-ITDs renormalization scheme. As
can be seen, the picture is consistent from all calculations:
P3 close or beyond 2 GeV cannot be reached reliably. This
is particularly true for ensembles with a pion mass near
or at the physical point.
The general picture of Table 1 should not be viewed
as a major disadvantage of the field, but as a motiva-

21

tion to develop and explore novel approaches, innovative
techniques and algorithms 10 . Such an example is the momentum smearing method [40], first explored in Ref. [36]
for non-local operators. Since then, it has been integrated
into all calculations. This direction has been instrumental
in allowing access to higher values of P3 . A recent exploration of the momentum-smearing within the distillation
framework can be found in Ref. [199]. We will soon enter
the exascale computing era, which promises more computing power. The combination of software and hardware developments will certainly benefit calculations of non-local
operators, leading to precision calculations with controlled
uncertainties.
The purpose of this review is to highlight the many
successes of the field, and point out the aspects that need
further exploration. Regardless of the necessary improvements, there is no doubt that accessing x-dependent parton distributions from lattice QCD is a major success towards understanding the complex structure of hadrons,
and gains visibility from the experimental and theoretical
nuclear physics communities.
