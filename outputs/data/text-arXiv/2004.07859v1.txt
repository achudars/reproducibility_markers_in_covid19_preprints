ABSTRACT: COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, is currently a major worldwide threat. It has infected more
than a million people globally leading to hundred-thousands of deaths. In such grave circumstances, it is very
important to predict the future infected cases to support prevention of the disease and aid in the healthcare
service preparation. Following that notion, we have developed a model and then employed it for forecasting
future COVID-19 cases in India. The study indicates an ascending trend for the cases in the coming days. A
time series analysis also presents an exponential increase in the number of cases. It is supposed that the present
prediction models will assist the government and medical personnel to be prepared for the upcoming conditions
and have more readiness in healthcare systems.

1. INTRODUCTION
The pandemic of 2019-nCov commenced from December 2019 in Wuhan, China and has caused extreme havoc
in almost the whole world.1,2 2019-nCoV or COVID-19, commonly known as Coronavirus, is a novel highly
contagious virus belonging to Coronaviridae family that has been suspected to be transmitted to humans from
animals. This virus causes mild to severe respiratory illness and death.3 This pandemic has engulfed 185
countries/regions in merely four months infecting 1,949,210 people and taking the death toll to 123,348.4,5
However, the premature cases show the infection is less severe as compared to other coronaviruses such as
SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome Corona Virus), the cases of rapid human-to-human transmission signify that 2019-nCoV is highly
infectious than others.6 Although a local seafood market in Wuhan is believed to be the source of exposure,7 the
scope of occurrence of this disease is not clear since its occurrence at present is so dynamic.3 An apparent
variation is present in epidemiological examinations and detection abilities performed by different countries for
detecting infected cases.8 Presently, the highest cases of 2019-nCoV infections have been reported in US,
however, the cases are abruptly rising in Spain, Italy, France and Germany daily.4 China, the place of origin of
the disease, is now receiving a very few cases. 4 The first case of coronavirus infection in India was reported on
30 January 2020 in Kerela, which was an imported case from Wuhan city of China.9 In the initial phase the
spread was extremely slow and only 3 people were positive for more than a month. However, the numbers

1

started rising exponentially after one month and continue to do so. The numbers in India have reached up to
10,453 for confirmed COVID-19 infected cases with 358 deaths and 1181 recoveries as reported on 13 April
2020.4 At present, there is neither a treatment nor a vaccination for the COVID-19 infection. Currently, it is a
major health crisis around the world and it would not be wrong to say that it is ‘an enemy to humanity’. In this
circumstance, the only option is preventing the occurrence of infection and preparing our healthcare system for
the probable up-comings.
In that reference, it is extremely crucial to construct models that are computationally competent as well as
realistic so that they can help policy makers, medical personals and also general public. Modeling the disease
and providing future forecast of possible number of daily cases can assist the medical system in getting prepared
for the new patients. The statistical prediction models are useful in forecasting as well as controlling the global
epidemic threat.
In the present effort, we have employed Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for
predicting the incidence of 2019-nCov disease. As compared to other prediction models, for instance support
vector machine (SVM) and wavelet neural network (WNN), ARIMA model is more capable in the prediction of
natural adversities.10 For our study, we have identified the best ARIMA model and then predicted the number
the cases for the next 20 days. The main objective of the study is to find the best predictive model and apply it to
forecast future incidence of COVID-19 cases in India.

2. METHODOLOGY
2.1 Dataset
Confirmed, recovered and death cases of COVID-19 infection are collected for India as well as countries with
highest confirmed infection (US, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, China and Iran) and countries in South-East
Asia region (India, Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal, Bhutan and Timor-Leste), as
per World Health Organization region classification, from the official website of Johns Hopkins University
(https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html) from 22 January 2020 to 13 April 2020.4
This data is used to build predictive models.

2.2 Model Development
For forecasting a time series, ARIMA modeling is one of the best modeling techniques. ARIMA models are
always represented with the help of some parameters and the model is expressed as ARIMA (p, d, q). Here, p
stands for the order of auto-regression, d signifies the degree of trend difference while q is the order of moving
average. We have applied an ARIMA model to the time series data of confirmed COVID-19 cases in India.
Autocorrelation function (ACF) graph and partial autocorrelation (PACF) graph is used to find the initial
number of ARIMA models. These ARIMA models are then tested for variance in normality and stationary.
Next, they are checked for accuracy by observing their MAPE, MAD and MSD values to determine the finest
model to forecast. In addition, the best fit ARIMA model is compared with Linear Trend, Quadratic Trend, SCurve Trend, Moving Average, Single Exponential as well as Double Exponential models using an output of
measure of accuracy, viz. MAPE, MAD, MSD, so as to select the finest model to forecast. The finest model is
the one which has the lowest value for all the measures. After fitting the model, its parameters are estimated

2

followed by verification of the model. The built model is employed to forecast confirmed COVID-19 cases for
the next 20 days, i.e. 14 April 2020 to 3 May 2020. The model for forecasting future confirmed COVID-19
cases is represented as,
𝐴𝑅𝐼𝑀𝐴(𝑝, 𝑑, 𝑓): 𝑋𝑡 = 𝛼1 𝑋𝑡−1 + 𝛼2 𝑋𝑡−2 + 𝛽1 𝑍𝑡−1 + 𝛽2 𝑍𝑡−2 + 𝑍𝑡

(1)

𝑍𝑡 = 𝑋𝑡 − 𝑋𝑡−1

where

(2)

Here, Xt is the predicted number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at t day, α1, α2, β1 and β2 are parameters
th

whereas Zt is the residual term for tth day. The trend of forthcoming incidences can be estimated from the
previous cases and a time series analysis is performed for this purpose. Time series forecasting refers to the
employment of a model to forecast future data based on previously observed data.11 In the present study, time
series analysis is used to recognize the trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases in India over the period of 22
January 2020 to 13 April 2020 and to predict future cases from 14 April 2020 till 3 May 2020. The level of
statistical significance is set at 0.05. A graph is plotted for actual confirmed cases and predicted confirmed cases
with respect to time to verify the efficiency of the model. To get an idea of the recovery and death trends in
India, a graph is plotted with respect to time.
A comparative study is also performed to examine the status of confirmed COVID-19 cases of India with
respect to those of highly infected countries. A similar comparison is made with the countries of South-East
Asia region as well. All the model developments, computations and comparisons have been performed using
Minitab software (version 17).12

3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
The present work encompasses development of a model to forecast COVID-19 incidences in the coming days.
The results for measure of model accuracy for ARIMA, Linear Trend, Quadratic Linear, S-Curve Trend,
Moving Average, Single Exponential as well as Double Exponential model are presented in Table 1. A look at
the MAPE, MAD and MSD values suggests that ARIMA (2, 2, 2) model is the most accurate of all for
forecasting future incidences as it possesses the least value for all the measures.

Thus, parameters are estimated for the ARIMA (2, 2, 2) model which are displayed in Table 2. It is observed
that AR (2) and MA (2) parameters have a p-value of 0.000, 0.167, 0.000 and 0.000 respectively, thus implying
that the parameters are significant in the model.

Figure 1 displays the residual plots for confirmed COVID-19 cases in India from 30 January 2020 to 13 April
2020. A slight deviation of residuals from the straight line can be observed from the plot. This indicates that the
errors are somewhat near to normal with a few outliers. Therefore, the normality assumption is followed. The
residual histogram backs up this assumption. The graph between residuals and the fitted values displays a little
dispersion. This implies that the assumption of constant variance is also satisfied by the model. The noncorrelation of residuals is clear from the plot of residuals versus the order of the data. The Ljung Box statistics
further corroborate this fact (Table 3). It is transparent that the p-value of all the lags is larger than the
significance level (i.e. 0.05) which means there is no violation of independent assumption. The suitability of the
ARIMA (2, 2, 2) model is indicated by the non-significance of p-value and other statistics.

ARIMA (2, 2, 2) model (Eq. (3)) is used to forecast confirmed COVID-19 cases in India for the next 20 days,
i.e. 14 April 2020 to 3 May 2020. The forecast for cases is presented in Table 4 with 95% confidence interval
(CI). According to the forecast, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is expected to increase considerably
in the coming 20 days. This increase is highly suspected to be associated with the people involved in a large
social gathering which took place just before the lockdown was imposed. Many of them have been tested
positive while a number of them are still untraceable. Thus, these people may cause transmissions and lead to
higher number of infected figures. Another reason may be the negligence on the part of a few people who didn’t
follow the suggested 14 day isolation after returning from abroad. Further, there is still a possibility that the
transmission might be occurring from asymptomatic cases with/without a travel history. It is also suspected that
there are many asymptomatic cases which are still not tested. To some extent, social media is also contributing
towards some cases owing to the fake information being spread through the platform. It is very important to
control such communications as they result in people moving out of their places due to wrong informations. All
these circumstances can end up in transmissions. Apart from that, until now, it hasn’t been confirmed whether a
recovered person can act as a carrier of the virus or not. Further, if it is possible, then for how long.
The lockdown period that began from 25 March 2020 has been extended up to 3 May 2020 considering the
present cases according to the current update. It has been noted that some people have ignored the situation and
warnings which resulted in a hasty increase in the number of infected cases. Hence, it is extremely crucial that
people are made aware of the situation and the lockdown is strictly imposed in the whole country to prevent
further transmission of the infection. If stringent measures are taken, it is believed that the number of new
infected cases should begin declining in approximately 20 days. Looking at the prevention approach employed
by China, that is, severe control and quarantine, it can be expected that India will also recover soon because of
its similar preventive measures.

Time series analysis presents the meaningful statistics for confirmed COVID-19 data. Figure 2 presents the time
series graph of the active infected COVID-19 cases from 30 January 2020 to 3 May 2020. It is clear from the
plot that the time series is not stationary. An increasing trend is displayed by the time series suggesting a high
rise in COVID-19 cases.

For comparing the actual and forecasted confirmed COVID-19 cases, a time series graph is plotted starting from
30 January 2020 till 13 April 2020. The plot is represented by Figure 3. The similarity of forecasted data with
actual data is clear from these plots. This comparison reveals the precision of the model in forecasting.

Trend for the number of recovery and death cases with respect to time due to COVID-19 infections in India
depicted in Figure 4. It is observed that the number of recoveries as well as deaths increase with time, however
the rate of recovery is higher than the death rate. Thus, a low mortality rate could be expected from the disease.

Figure 5 shows a comparative study of confirmed COVID-19 infection cases of India with respect to those of
highly infected countries. According to the plot, US is the most infected while India the least infected of the
selected countries, viz. US, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, China and Iran. It is very obvious as India was the
last amongst these countries to get infected. However, the plot also reflects that China has been able to control
the pandemic and is now presenting very few new cases. Thus, it follows that if strict prevention measures such
as quarantine and sanitization are continued for some days, the situation could be controlled in the coming days.
In the remaining countries, infected cases are growing exponentially and severe spread of infection is seen.
A similar comparison is performed for the countries of South-East Asia region as well as shown in Figure 6. A
look at the Figure 6 suggests India to be the most infected amongst the South-East Asian countries followed by
Indonesia and Thailand. All the three countries are presenting continuous rise in confirmed COVID-19
infections. The remaining countries of the region have a very low infection rate, lowest being in Timor-Leste.

It is clear that measures like quarantine and sanitization can decrease human exposure and control this
pandemic. Thus, these measures should be stringently imposed in India and strict actions must be taken against
those people who violate the rules and don’t consider the severity of the situation. Although a large amount of
data helps in providing a more exhaustive prediction and explanation, in the present circumstance, these models
could be valuable in anticipating future cases of infection if the pattern of virus spread didn’t change
abnormally. It is obvious that this virus is new and has the capability to be transmitted intensely. Hence, it may
have an influence on the predictions, however as per our knowledge, in the present situation this model is the
finest.

4. CONCLUSION
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared as pandemic by WHO and is currently a major
global threat. In order to support the prevention of the disease and aid in the healthcare service preparation, we
have conducted this study to examine the finest model for the prediction of confirmed COVID-19 infection
cases and to employ that model for forecasting future COVID-19 infection cases in India. As per the model
forecast, the confirmed cases are expected to greatly rise in the coming days. The time series analysis shows an
exponential enhancement in the infected cases. However, it is also anticipated that the efforts such as lockdown
may affect this prediction and cases may start to decline after a month approximately. A comparative study with
some of the highly infected countries and countries in south-east Asia region indicates that India can still control
the situation if the prevention measures such as quarantine and city sanitization are strictly followed. The
prediction models will help the government and medical workforce to be prepared for the upcoming situations
and have more readiness in healthcare systems.
