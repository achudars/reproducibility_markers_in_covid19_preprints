Abstract
SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the disease known as Covid-19, has so far reported
around 3,435,000 cases of human infections, including more than 239,000 deaths in 187
countries, with no effective treatment currently available. For this reason, it is necessary to
explore new approaches for the development of a drug capable of inhibiting the entry of the
virus into the host cell. Therefore, this work includes the exploration of potential inhibitory
compounds for the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6VSB), which were obtained
from The Patogen Box. Later, they were filtered through virtual screening and molecular
docking techniques, thus obtaining a top of 1000 compounds, which were used against a
binding site located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and a cryptic site located in
the N-Terminal Domain (NTD), resulting in good pharmaceutical targets for the blocking
the infection. From the top 1000, the best compound (TCMDC-124223) was selected for
the binding site. It interacts with specific residues that intervene in the recognition and
subsequent entry into the host cell, resulting in a more favorable binding free energy in
comparison to the control compounds (Hesperidine and Emodine). In the same way, the
1

compound TCMDC-133766 was selected for the cryptic site. These identified compounds are
potential inhibitors that can be used for the development of new drugs that allow effective
treatment for the disease.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, molecular docking, spike, cryptic site

1. Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of enveloped positive chain RNA viruses, which
belong to the Nidoviral order and are primarily responsible for upper respiratory and digestive tract infections, both in domestic animals and in humans [1, 2]. In the last 20
years, multiples CoVs have been transmitted from animal hosts to humans, causing severe
outbreaks of respiratory diseases and coming to be considered as pandemic on two occasions [3, 4]. Since then, multiple efforts have been made to study these viruses in different
animals in order to identify potential infectious agents who affect humans [5, 6, 7].
In December 2019, a new type of CoV (SARS-CoV-2), causing the disease called COVID19, was reported in the city of Wuhan, China, which has been spreading rapidly throughout
China and all the world. Currently (May 2020), the World Health Organization has reported
more than 3,435,000 cases of human infections, including more than 239,000 deaths in 187
countries. That is why, since its emergence, various investigations have been carried out to
understand the phylogenetic relationships of this virus, as well as the structural characteristics of its proteins, mainly those that are involved in the processes of viral replication and
pathogenesis, in order to discover inhibitors thereof [8, 9, 10].
The Spike (S) protein is a multifunctional molecular machinery that mediates the entry
of CoV into host cells, in addition to promoting transmission between species, especially in
Betacoronaviruses (βCoV) [11]. This protein belongs to class I of viral fusion proteins. That
is, it needs to be cleaved by a cellular protease to bind to the host receptor [12, 13, 14, 15, 16].

The S protein is a 180 kDa homotrimer consisting of an extracellular domain, an intermembrane domain, and an intracellular domain [17]. The extracellular domain contains the
S1 and S2 subunits, related to membrane recognition and fusion, respectively [18]. The S1
subunit contains a region called Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) that mediates the recognition of the host cell [19, 16], which varies between the different coronavirus lineages, being
the converting enzyme of angiotensin-2 (ACE2) the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [20].
On the other hand, the S protein is cleaved in the inter domain of the S1 and S2 subunits,
through the activity of certain host proteases, which allows the fusion of protein S with the
cell membrane for the entry of the virus [21]. These proteases are a determining factor in
the host range pathogenicity, tissue tropism, and transmissibility [22]. Protein S can be
cleaved with one or more proteases, such as furin, trypsin, cathepsin, transmembrane serine
protease-2 (TMPRSS-2) and Human Airway Tripsin-like Protease (HAT), which determine
the mode of entry of the virus, either through the membrane or by endocytosis [23].
The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD consists mainly of 5 antiparallel β sheets (β1,
β2, β3, β4 and β7), in addition to short α helices connected by loops that form the core
of the structure [24]. Between sheets β7 and β4 there is an extended insert that contains
short β sheets 5 and 6, α4 and α5 helices, and loops, which make up the recognition Binding
Motif (RBM), which contains the main recognition residues [25]. In addition, this region
has four disulfide bridges, of which 3 of them (C336-C361, C379-C432 and C391-C525) help
stabilize the core, while another disulfide bridge (C480-C488) stabilizes the loop in the final
distal part [26].
Several studies have described, at structural level, the way in which the RBD domain
joins the ACE2 receptor peptidase (PD) domain [27, 25], which is caused by rearrangement
of the surface of these two molecules in the binding regions that present a highly hydrophobic
environment [27]. During RBD-ACE2 interaction, the formation of 13 hydrogen bridges and
two salt bridges occur, where residues K417, G446, Y449 N467, N487, Y489, Q493, T500,
N501 G502, and Y505, located on the surface of the RBM, mediate these interactions [24]. In
addition, in SARS-CoV-2, unlike SARS-CoV, voluminous residues (V483 and E484) located
in the loop of the junction bridge have been identified, which increases the contact surface
3

and improves recognition for the initiation of the infection [25].
As proteins are dynamic structures, during their rearrangement, transient binding sites
known as cryptic pocket, can originate [28, 29]. These sites are formed only when the
protein structure is in its holo state (protein-ligand) and are characterized by presenting less
hydrophobic residues with greater flexibility [30]. Finding these hidden sites can be a difficult
task. However, in recent years, the study of these cryptic sites has taken on great importance,
because they provide relevant biological information on sites not previously described in
proteins that are considered pharmaceutical targets. Improve treatments in cases where the
inhibition of the active site cannot occur with sufficient potency and specificity, in addition,
its identification can expand the drugable protomer [28]. A clear example of a recently
developed algorithm to identify cryptic sites without the need to have the structure bound
to a ligand is Cryptosite [30].
In this context, the present work addresses the drugability of the RBD domain and
potential cryptic sites in the crystallographic structure of S protein. This is needed in
order to identify potential inhibitors for these regions, through the use of biophysical and
computational chemistry tools. Finally, to obtain an inhibitor capable of blocking the entry
of the virus into the host cell.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Drug database
A library of chemical compounds was obtained from The Pathogen Box (Van Voorhis et
al., 2016), frequently used in the search for treatment against malaria. This box originally
contains around 20,000 compounds in SMILE format, stored in a XLSX file, which were used
for virtual screening tests. The compounds were filtered based on the criteria established in
Lipinsky’s rule of 5 [31], selecting only those molecules that do not show any violation of the
rule. Subsequently, the compounds were converted to SDF, PDB and PDBQT formats, in
this order consecutively, using OpenBabel v2.4.1 software [32], adding polar hydrogens for
pH 7.4, following the methodology described in Ref. [33]. In addition, the three-dimensional
4

structures of the compounds were minimized using the MMFF96 force field, implemented
in the OpenBabel software, in order to optimize their geometry. This entire procedure was
performed using an in-house Python script that automates each of the steps described for
each compound.
2.2. Receptor preparation: binding and cryptic site
The CryoEM-resolved structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein was obtained from
the Protein Data Bank [34]in PDB format (PDB ID: 6VSB, 3.46 Å resolution) [17]. Afterwards, the structure was repaired by adding missing loops and missing atoms with SwissModel [35], followed by adding di-sulfide bridges (C131-C166, C291-C301, C336-C361, C379C432, C391-C525 C538-C590, C617-C649, C662-C671, C738-C760, C743-C749, C1032-C1043
and C1082-C1126) using the PDB Reader module available from Charmm-GUI [36]. Subsequently, the structure was prepared with MGLTools v1.5.7 [37], with which Gasteiger-Marsili
fillers and polar hydrogens are added, and finally it was converted to .PDBQT format.
For virtual screening assays, the RBD region, located in the S1 domain (RBD-S1) of S
protein, was considered as a potential site of inhibition, since this region has been reported
in various studies as the region binding to the human ACE2 receptor, mediating the onset
of infection [38, 39, 40, 41, 20]. Amino acids Y396, S399 and F400 were selected as the
proximal, central and distal reference point in the RBD to cover this entire domain, when
configuring the simulation box both in virtual screening and in molecular docking. Likewise,
putative cryptic sites were predicted, using the CryptoSite server [30], keeping those cryptic
sites that had a score of ≥ 20. Both the RBD site and the predicted cryptic site were used
for the virtual screening trials. The coordinates, and the size of the simulation box were
configured on the two sites using MGLTools v1.5.7.
2.3. Virtual screening
With the database of the filtered chemical compounds, a virtual screening was performed on the RBD-S1 region and on the cryptic pocket, using the Autodock-Vina v1.1.2
software [42]. The search parameters were: exhaustiveness of 20 and spacing of 1.00 Å, for
5

both. Furthermore, in this procedure, a second in-house Python script was used to automatically run the virtual screening and select, from the results, the top 1000 compounds
with the best binding energy for a second filtering using molecular docking.
2.4. Molecular Docking
Using the Autodock GPU software [37, 43], a molecular docking was performed with the
top 1000 molecules. This new Autodock uses the Solis-Wets algorithm. A new gridbox was
prepared on the previously described binding sites, using a spacing of 0.375 in both cases.
The parameters of the molecular docking were: population size of 350, number of evaluations
of 2500000, number of generations of 27000, a mutation ratio of 0.02, a crossover ratio of
0.8 and number of run equal 100. In each docking trial, the selection of the best poses was
made based on the 2D score (2DS) described by Blanco 2019. It normalizes two variables
of its own for each pose using the following arithmetic combination 2DS = Npop − N M BE,
where Npop is the population of the cluster where the pose of the ligand was classified, and
N M BE is the average coupling energy. This procedure was carried out in the same way
using another in-house Python script, to automate the procedures and make a new selection
of the top 10 best compounds based on binding energies, both for the RBD and for the
cryptic site. Each selected pose was extracted with PyMol v2.3.5 and converted to PDB
format for subsequent simulations.
2.5. Data analysis and biomolecular graphics
The resulting data from virtual screening was treated using a Python and C++ inhouse scripts. The first one was used to select the top of the best ligands based on the
binding energy and the second one, to convert the binding energy (∆G) to the dissociation
constant (kd ), through the equation ∆G = RT ln(kd ) (R is the gas constant and T is the
temperature, taken equal to 300 K).The generated poses that showed the best interaction
energies were analyzed with PLIP [44] to determine the type and number of interactions
between compounds and receptor. The figures were rendered with VMD software [45].

3. Results
The untimely appearance of SARS-CoV-2, as a result of a kind of global crisis, has affected not only China, but hundreds of other countries, where the impact has been worse.
Therefore, many research groups in the world are putting all their interest and efforts on it.
The main interest is to block the virus from entering the host cell, and give the immune system time to recognize and eliminate it. For this purpose, multiple approaches are explored.
The one we explored here was to identify potential small molecules with the ability to interact with key residues involved in the molecular recognition of the ACE2-RBD complex,
which was successfully achieved, and it is shown in the following paragraphs of this section.
3.1. Virtual screening and molecular docking
As reported in various studies, the Recognition Binding Domain of SARS-Cov-2 spike
protein mediates the entry of the virus into the host cell through the human ACE2 receptor [12, 13, 14, 19, 15, 16, 20]. Therefore, this domain was considered the binding site for
virtual screening evaluations, since the main amino acids involved in the interaction are
found in this region (Y396, S399 and F400) (figure 1A), and, which are also points of access
to the distal and proximal regions of the domain that allowed us to cover most of the domain. On the other hand, we introduced the search for another region of the protein as an
interaction site with small molecules, this site is called cryptic site, which was predicted with
the Cryptosite server [30], managing to observe this cryptic site with potential drugability,
located in the N-Terminal Domain (figure 1C).
In the virtual screening, the compounds were classified based on their free binding energy, ∆G, obtaining the top 1000 compounds with the best binding and cryptic site affinity.
Subsequently, the evaluation of the top 1000 compounds, by molecular docking, allowed identifying the top 10 ligands that have high affinity with the RBD of S protein, in the binding
site and cryptic site (∆G ≤ −8.53 kcal/mol and ∆G ≤ −10.66 kcal/mol, respectively).
To determine the molecular recognition and test that these interact with key residues,
the analysis was performed with PLIP software, where it was observed that the ligands
interacted forming hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, aromatic interactions and hydrophobic

interactions (tables 1 and 2). In the binding site, a frequently observed interaction, in eight
of the best compounds studied, was that of hydrogen bonds, with at least one of the residues
N487 and/or Y489 (table 1), which are important for their participation in binding to ACE2.
While at the cryptic site, hydrogen-bridged interactions were observed more frequently with
residues H207, Q173, and R190 (table 2).
Compound TCMDC-124223 presented the most favorable interaction energy (∆G =
−8.53 kcal/mol, kd = 530.53 nM ) at the binding site (RBD) of S protein. This compound
is molecularly recognized by the formation of hydrogen bonds with residues N487, Y489
and L492, at distances of 2.14 Å, 3.37 Å and 3.43 Å, respectively (figure 2A). Furthermore,
it presents an aromatic interaction with residue Y489 and hydrophobic interactions with
residues F456, Y473, A475, Q484, Y489, F490 and L492 (table 1).

At the cryptic site, compound TCMDC-133766 presented the best interaction energy
(∆G = −10.66 kcal/mol, kd = 14.37 nM ), which exceeds the compounds evaluated in the
binding site. The mode of binding of this compound is mediated by the formation of a
hydrogen bridge with residue I101, at a distance of 1.98 Å. Likewise, in the formation of the
complex, aromatic interactions with residues F92, T104, F192 and R190 and hydrophobic

Additionally, two drugs (Hespiridine and Emodin), approved by the FDA, were taken
as controls for the analysis of molecular docking. Emodin presented a binding energy
−5.62 kcal/mol; while, the compound Hespidiridine, presented an energy of −2.46 kcal/mol
(table 3). Similarly, analysis with PLIP software found that these drugs form hydrogen
bridge-type interactions with important residues, such as Y473 and N487, and hydrophobic
interactions (figure 2K).

4. Discussion
The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents one of the greatest challenges due to its
easy transmission [25]. Despite various investigations being conducted, so far no treatment
is effective in fighting this virus. Computational approaches are promising alternatives for
finding potential inhibitors through drug repositioning. Therefore, this research focused
on the search for RBD inhibitors for S protein that can prevent recognition by the ACE2
receptor.
The results of the virtual screening of 13, 102 compounds allowed the identification of
potential inhibitors that can be used in the treatment of Covid-19, including TCMDC124223, GNF-Pf-2151 and GNF-Pf-209 for the binding site (RBD) and TCMDC-133766,
TCMDC-135260 and TCMDC-124284 for the cryptic site (NTD). These compounds have
previously been used as antimalarial potentials [46], which demonstrates their versatility.
Various studies indicate that the amino acids located in the RBM contribute substantially
to the recognition and subsequent entry of the virus into the cell [26, 47, 48]. Our analyzes
demonstrate that six compounds manage to interact by forming hydrogen bonds with residue
N487 (table 1), and polar contacts with residue Y83 of the ACE2 receptor [49]. Likewise,
eight compounds show hydrophobic interactions with the Y489 residue (table 1). This type
of interaction with the K31 residue of ACE2 has been shown to be conserved among variants
of this protein [50]. This suggests that the interactions formed could cause modifications in
the contact surface, preventing recognition.
Furthermore, the formation of hydrophobic interactions with the K417 residue was observed in at least four compounds in the top 10. This residue is known to be located in the
loop of the proximal part of the RBM and has a high-energy contribution (−93.13 kcal/mol)
during molecular recognition with ACE2 [51]. In this sense, those compounds that present
some form of favorable interaction with this residue could promote a competitive type inhibition on the contact surface. However, chemical modifications could be introduced, to raise
the binding energy. Similar studies have highlighted the importance of this residue in the
inhibition of RBD [27, 24].
16

As other studies point out, the drugability of cryptic sites allows modifying the thermodynamic or structural characteristics of proteins [30]. In this study, we report a potential
drugable cryptic site, located in the N-Terminal domain of the Spike protein. The structure
that makes up this cryptic site allows the virus to merge with the cell membrane [27, 23],
so its inhibition could indirectly prevent the entry of the virus. The drug that presented
the best mode of coupling on this cryptic site (TCMDC-133766) has shown a higher affinity
(−10.66 kcal/mol) compared to the best compounds tested in the RBD. In this sense, it is
possible to evaluate the synergism of the inhibition of RBD and NTD, in such a way that
the activity of the Spike protein can be suppressed with greater effectiveness.
On the other hand, it was observed that the compounds with the best interaction energy
have common functional chemical groups of other inhibitor molecules [52]. The functional
groups of the top compounds in the binding site (RBD) are mainly of the secondary amino,
hydroxyl, and carboxamine type. In the cryptic site, the most representative functional
groups are the secondary amines, tertiary amino and carboxamines (tables 1 and 2). These
functional groups, which form hydrogen bonds, can be considered for rational drug design
based on a pharmacophore model, as has been proposed for other drugable targets [53].
For the control of molecular docking evaluations, two compounds were used, Emodine
and Hespiridine, which are approved by the FDA [54, 55]. These drugs interact with important residues in the RBD (N487 and Y489). However, it has been observed that these
compounds present lower interaction energies (−5.62 kcal/mol and −2.46 kcal/mol respectively) compared to the top of the evaluated compounds. This suggests that the compounds
reported in this work could improve the inhibitory activity on the Spike protein.
Finally, our studies suggest a pharmacological potential of the present molecules against
the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. In-vivo studies can confirm the inhibitory activity of
these compounds. Furthermore, the functional groups of these drugs can be used to search
for similar compounds in different databases.

17

5. Conclusion
Our approach has allowed us to identify a set of small molecules with the capacity to
interrupt the interaction of ACE2-RBD, since their molecular recognition is associated with
key residues in the interaction of the ACE2-RBD complex, and that these can also interact
with the cryptic site and can reduce the interaction of this complex, through synergism.
In therapy, that it is called combination therapy, which has shown better benefits in the
treatment of the disease. However, these compounds must be tested in-vitro to demonstrate
their activity, and undergo the respective clinical tests. It is worth mentioning that the
functional groups of these compounds could be used to perform pharmacophore models,
and to identify FDA-approved drugs and speed up clinical tests.
