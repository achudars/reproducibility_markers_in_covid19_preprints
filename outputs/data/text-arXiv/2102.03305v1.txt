Abstract
The spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health crisis.
The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 (in particular the receptor binding domain, RBD)
to its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the antibodies is of great
importance in understanding the infectivity of COVID-19 and evaluating the candidate
therapeutic for COVID-19. In this work, we propose a new method based on molecular
mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) to accurately calculate the
free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 and antibodies. The calculated
binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 is -13.3 kcal/mol, and that of
SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2 is -11.4 kcal/mol, which agrees well with experimental
result (-11.3 kcal/mol and -10.1 kcal/mol, respectively). Moreover, we take two recently
reported antibodies as the example, and calculate the free energy of antibodies binding
to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, which is also consistent with the experimental findings. Further,
within the framework of the modified MM/PBSA, we determine the key residues and
the main driving forces for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/CB6 interaction by the
computational alanine scanning method. The present study offers a computationally
efficient and numerically reliable method to evaluate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2
binding to other proteins, which may stimulate the development of the therapeutics

against the COVID-19 disease in real applications.

1. Introduction
By October 31th 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected over
46 million individuals and led the death of more than 1.2 million people in the whole
world.[1] The COVID-2019 is mainly caused by the novel severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),[2-4] which is closely related to several bat
coronaviruses and to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).[3-5]
Similar to SARS-CoV, the spike glycoprotein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 plays an
important role in the virus entry, which can bind the human angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein via S1 domain (in particular the receptor binding domain,
RBD) and fuse with the cell membrane via S2 domain.[6-9] The similarity between the
two spike glycoproteins (i.e., SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) was nearly 80%.[5,10]
However, SARS-CoV-2 was believed to transmit from human to human more easily
(compared to SARS-CoV), thereby caused much more cases.
More recently, monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD of the spike glycoprotein
are increasingly recognized as a promising method of treating COVID-2019.[11-17] For
example, Shi et al.[11] isolated two specific human monoclonal antibodies (i.e., CA1 and
CB6) from a convalescent COVID-19 patient, and demonstrated potent SARS-CoV-2specific neutralization activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2. Wang et al.[12] reported an
antibody named 47D11 that binds a conserved epitope on the RBD to cross-neutralize
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Such targeting behavior (distal from the receptor
binding site) was also reported by Wilson and coworkers,[13] where they also determined
the crystal structures of the complex of antibody CR3022 with the receptor binding
domain (RBD).
Apart from the great progress in the experimental and clinical studies, there have
been some simulation works that investigated the interaction between ACE2 and RBD

at the molecular level.[18-26] For example, Wang et al.[18] revealed that the binding
interface (of ACE2-RBD) consists of a primarily hydrophobic region and a delicate
hydrogen-bonding network. Amin et al.[20] compared the binding affinities of the RBD
of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 and found that the binding energies at the
interface are a bit higher for SARS-CoV-2 because of enhanced electrostatic
interactions. Zou et al.[26] performed computational alanine scanning mutagenesis on
the hotspot residues using relative binding free energy calculations, and found that the
mutations in SARS-CoV-2 led to a greater binding affinity relative to SARS-CoV. More
importantly, Han et al.[22] computationally designed some peptide inhibitors extracted
from the sequence of ACE2, which showed a highly specific and stable binding
(blocking) to SARS-CoV-2.
Notably, it is still hugely challenging to accurately calculate the free energy of
SARS-CoV-2 binding to its receptor ACE2 and the antibodies, which can not only
provide insights into the ACE2-RBD interaction (in particular the effect of the residue
mutation on the transmitting ability), but also guide the experimental design of manmade monoclonal antibodies. However, in highly charged bio-systems, the accuracy of
the free energy by traditional molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area
(MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA),
especially the MM/PBSA, could be very poor.[27-28] On the other hand, although the
prediction by alchemical free energy (AFE) methods like free energy perturbation (FEP)
and thermodynamic integration (TI) is believed to be more accurate, the computational
cost of these methods is extremely expensive,[29] and more importantly the convergence
of the FEP and TI is also very difficult in charged systems.[30-31] For example, the
experimental results all demonstrate that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2
was about -13.0~-10.0 kcal/mol,[6,10,32] and was a little stronger than that of SARS-CoV
to ACE2 (although the absolute value of the binding affinity was varied among different
experiments). However, the calculated binding free energy by different simulation
methods was from dozens to hundreds of kcal/mol, [20-25] which is much stronger than
that in real experiment. Some simulation studies even indicated that the binding affinity
of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 was weaker than that of SARS-CoV to ACE2,[24-25] which

certainly contradicted with the main experimental findings. Thus, presently there
existed a big gap between the prediction by the simulation method and that in real
experiments, which urgently requires the improvement of free-energy methods.
In this study, we propose a new MM/PBSA method based on the screening
electrostatic energy in molecular mechanics to evaluate the binding free energy of
SARS-CoV-2 and other proteins. As we will show below, when combining with the
interaction entropy method, the predicted binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2
and SARS-CoV to ACE2 is in good agreement with the experimental result. Moreover,
the binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 to two antibodies (i.e., CR3022 and CB6) with
potential clinical use is evaluated based on the proposed method, and also agrees with
the experimental result. Further, the computational alanine scanning demonstrates the
significant role of R97 in CB6 and R403 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD as well as the
hydrophobic contacts in the CB6/SARS-CoV-2 interaction.

(PDB ID: 6W41).

2. Modeling and Methods

As shown in Figure 1, four different protein complexes were considered in this
work, namely SARS-CoV-2 (RBD)/ACE2 (PDB ID: 6M0J),[10] SARS-CoV
(RBD)/ACE2 (PDB ID: 2AJF),[33] SARS-CoV-2 (RBD)/CB6 (PDB ID: 7C01),[11] and
SARS-CoV-2 (RBD)/CR3022 (PDB ID: 6W41).[13] Each complex was solvated in
TIP3P water[34] (the minimum distances from the surfaces of the box to the complex
atoms were set to 15Å), with NaCl to neutralize the systems at the concentration of
0.15 M. The system was firstly energy-minimized by the steepest descent method
until the convergence was reached. Then the system was gradually heated from 0 to
298 K in the NVT ensemble over a period of 500 ps, and then relaxed by 500 ps in the
NPT ensemble with 1000 kJ*mol-1*nm-2 harmonic constraints on the heavy atoms of
the proteins, where the temperature was controlled at 298 K by the V-rescale
thermostat with a time constant of 0.2 ps and the pressure was kept at 1 atm by the
Berendsen barostat with a time constant of 2.0 ps. Finally, 2 ns NPT simulations with
weak constrains (100 kJ*mol-1*nm-2) on the heavy atoms of the proteins were
performed for each system, which could prevent the structural drift to the incorrect
protein structures.[35-36] All the MD simulations were carried out by using GROMACS
2019.03 package[37] with Amber ff14sb force ﬁeld.[38] The LINCS constraints were
used to all bonds involving hydrogen atoms.[39] The particle mesh Ewald method was
used when calculating the long-range electrostatic interactions,[40] and the LennardJones (LJ) interactions were cut off at a distance of 1.0 nm. The periodic boundary
conditions were adopted in all three directions.
In standard MM/PBSA, the binding free energy (∆𝐺𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑 ) between the proteins is
calculated as:[41-42]
∆𝐺𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑 = 𝐺𝑐𝑜𝑚 − (𝐺𝑝𝑟𝑜𝐴 + 𝐺𝑝𝑟𝑜𝐵 ),
∆𝐺𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑 = ∆H − T∆S ≈ ∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 + ∆𝐺𝑠𝑜𝑙 − 𝑇∆𝑆,
∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 = ∆𝐸𝑖𝑛𝑡 + ∆𝐸𝑒𝑙𝑒 + ∆𝐸𝑣𝑑𝑤 ,
∆𝐺𝑠𝑜𝑙 = ∆𝐺𝑃𝐵 + ∆𝐺𝑆𝐴 ,
where 𝐺𝑐𝑜𝑚 is the free energy of the complex, and 𝐺𝑝𝑟𝑜𝐴 is the free energy of one
protein and 𝐺𝑝𝑟𝑜𝐵 is the free energy of the other protein. ∆𝐺𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑 can be usually
decomposed into three terms: the gas-phase interaction energy ∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 , the
desolvation free energy ∆𝐺𝑠𝑜𝑙 , and the conformational entropy −𝑇∆𝑆.

∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 is composed of ∆𝐸𝑖𝑛𝑡 , ∆𝐸𝑣𝑑𝑤 , and ∆𝐸𝑒𝑙𝑒 . Since there were no bonds
between the proteins, ∆𝐸𝑖𝑛𝑡 was zero in this case. ∆𝐸𝑣𝑑𝑤 is the VDW interaction
energy between the proteins, and calculated by the Lennard-Jones (12-6) potentials.
∆𝐸𝑒𝑙𝑒 is the electrostatic energy between the proteins, and is usually calculated by
using the following equation:
𝑞𝑞

𝑖 𝑗
∑𝑝𝑟𝑜𝐵
∆𝐸𝑒𝑙𝑒 = ∑𝑝𝑟𝑜𝐴
,
𝑖
𝑗
4𝜋𝜀 𝜀 𝑟
0 𝑖𝑛 𝑖𝑗

where 𝑞𝑖 , 𝑞𝑗 is the charge of the atom i, atom j in the two proteins, respectively, 𝑟𝑖𝑗
is the distance between atom i and atom j, 𝜀0 is the dielectric constant in the vacuum,
and 𝜀𝑖𝑛 is the relative dielectric constant of the solute (i.e., the protein).
However, since the proteins carry some net charges, there are a lot of counter-ions
around them, thus the effective electrostatic interaction between them is greatly
changed. To mimic the screening effect, we added an additional exponential damping
to the Columbic term according to Debye−Huckel theory,[43-44] i.e.,
𝑞𝑞

𝑖 𝑗
∑𝑝𝑟𝑜𝐵
∆𝐸𝑒𝑙𝑒 = ∑𝑝𝑟𝑜𝐴
𝑒 −𝑟𝑖𝑗/𝜆𝐷 ,
𝑖
𝑗
4𝜋𝜀 𝜀 𝑟
0 𝑖𝑛 𝑖𝑗

where 𝜆𝐷 is the Debye length, and can be determined by Debye−Huckel theory:[43, 44]
𝜀0 𝜀𝑟 𝑘𝐵 𝑇
⁄∑ 𝑐 𝑒 2 𝑧 2 ,
𝑖 𝑖
𝑖

𝜆𝐷 = √

where r is the relative dielectric constant of the medium/solvent, ci and zi is the
concentration and the net charge of ion i, respectively, the sum is over all ionic species.
When the type of the salt is NaCl (0.15 M) and the temperature is 298K, the Debye
length can be calculated as 𝜆𝐷 = 8.0 Å.
∆𝐺𝑠𝑜𝑙 is the sum of ∆𝐺𝑆𝐴 (non-polar contribution) and ∆𝐺𝑃𝐵 (polar contribution).
The former one is usually estimated using the solvent accessible surface area (SASA),
i.e., ∆𝐺𝑆𝐴 = 𝛾 ∙ 𝑆𝐴𝑆𝐴 + 𝑏, where 𝛾 is the surface tension 0.0227 kJ*mol-1*Å-2 and b
is the constant 3.8493 kJ*mol-1. The latter one is calculated by using the PoissonBoltzmann (PB) model; due to the highly charged property of ACE2, the electrostatic
potential was obtained by solving the non-linear Poisson- Boltzmann Equation (nPBE)
in this work.[42]
The entropy term is calculated by the interaction entropy (IE) method,[45-46] by which
one can calculate the entropic term directly from the molecular dynamics simulations
without any extra computational cost. The definition of the interaction entropy is as
follows:
−𝑇∆𝑆 = 𝑘𝐵 𝑇𝑙𝑛 < 𝑒
where

∆∆𝐸𝑀𝑀
⁄𝑘 𝑇
𝐵

1

>= 𝑘𝐵 𝑇ln(𝑁 ∑𝑁
𝑖=1 𝑒

∆∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 (𝑖)
⁄𝑘 𝑇
𝐵 ),

∆∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 (𝑖) = ∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 (𝑖)−< ∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 > , and denotes the fluctuation of

protein−protein interaction energy around the average energy, 𝑘𝐵 is the Boltzmann
constant.
In the binding free energy calculation, 100 frames (with an interval of 10 ps in the
last 1 ns) was used for calculating the binding energy in each system via the
MM/PBSA method. All the MM/PBSA calculations were performed by using the
modified shell script gmx_mmpbsa.[47] 10000 frames (with an interval of 0.1 ps) were
used for calculating the entropic term via the interaction entropy (IE) method. Three
independent runs were performed for each system to obtained the standard deviation.
Moreover, the computational alanine scanning was carried with the simple mutations
within the framework of the single-trajectory method.[48-49] In more detail, the mutated
trajectory was simply generated from the wild-type trajectory, where the side chain of
the residue was truncated and the Cβ atom and its linking hydrogen atoms were
retained. Then a hydrogen atom was added in the same direction as that of the Cβ–X
(the truncated atom) bond and the length of the new Cβ–H bond was set to the default
value in the force field. The simple mutation is an easy, efficient and fast mutagenesis
method to identify the hot spots at the binding interface. Yet one should be careful
when the conformational change of proteins is obvious due to the mutation.[50]
Additionally, this method cannot be applied when mutating a smaller residue to a
larger one.[48]

3. Results and Discussion
The free energy of SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 calculated by standard MM/PBSA
and screening MM/PBSA is listed in Table S1. Since ACE2 carries a net charge of -28e
and SARS-CoV-2 RBD carries a net charge of +2e, the attractive electrostatic energy
would be very strong when neglecting the screening effect under the dielectric constant
2.0 (a typical setup for biomolecules), which led to the extremely low binding energy
(Figure 2). We further increased the dielectric constantin standard MM/PBSA. Even
if the dielectric constant was set as 17.0 (Table S1), the electrostatic energy was greatly
reduced but the PB energy also decreased a lot, the predicted binding free energy (~55.4 kcal/mol) was still much larger than the experimental result (~-11.3 kcal/mol). On

the contrary, the binding free energy predicted by the screening MM/PBSA was about
-13.3 kcal/mol, which was close to that in the experiment.

Figure 2. The comparison of the free energy among the standard MM/PBSA (using
different in), the screening MM/PBSA (in=2.0), and the experiment result in the
cases of SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 and SARS-CoV RBD/ACE2. The standard
deviation for simulation data were obtained by three independent runs, and that for the
experimental data were obtained by three experimental works.[6,10,32]

To test the robustness of the binding free energy calculated by the screening
MM/PBSA, we systematically investigate the effect of the length of simulation time,
the temperature, as well as the water molecules on the results. As shown in Figure S1,
the RMSD was nearly the same at different temperature. Although the temperature
may also change the relative dielectric constant of the water and the Debye length, the
change was very little, thus the binding free energy and the energy terms were nearly
the same at 298 K and 310 K. Similarly, the time length had very little impact on the
binding free energy (Figure S2). Moreover, we also explicitly considered the
associated water molecules at the binding site in MM/PBSA. In this case, although the
energy terms changed obviously, namely the electrostatic energy was enhanced and at
the same time the PB energy was increased (and balanced out the increase of the
electrostatic energy), the total binding energy changed little in the presence of water
molecules (Figure S3). This is probably due to the weak association of water

molecules with the two proteins at the binding site.
We also calculated the residue contact probability to determine the binding interface
(Figure S4) and analyzed the key residues in the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 interaction via
the residue energy decomposition in MM/PBSA. Figure 3 illustrates the residues of top
ten binding energies in SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2, respectively. In screening
MM/PBSA, most of these residues were at the binding site except few charged residues
like K444 in SARS-CoV-2 and E23 in ACE2 (these charged residues were also near the
binding site, see Figure 3a-b). Notably, previous studies[10,18] indicated the significant
roles of Y449, N487, T500, G502, Y505 in forming hydrogen bonds, and that of F456,
Y473, F486, Y489 in forming the hydrophobic pockets, most of which were listed in
the top ten residues here. Nevertheless, since the standard MM/PBSA overestimated the
attractively electrostatic interaction in the long range, most of the residues were charged
residues and the binding energy per residue was extremely strong in SARS-CoV-2
(Figure 3c). Besides, these top ten residues were far away from the binding site (Figure
3d), which was certainly unreasonable. We further analyzed the binding energy
inside/outside the binding site with screening MM/PBSA and standard MM/PBSA,
respectively. As shown in Figure S5, the standard MM/PBSA showed that the binding
site played little role in the binding energy since the electrostatic energy was very small
compared to the total electrostatic energy. As a result, the binding energy at the binding
site accounted for very small proportion in the total binding energy in standard
MM/PBSA. On the contrary, the screening MM/PBSA indicated the significant role of
the binding site in the total binding energy, where the electrostatic energy was
dominated at the binding site.

Figure 3. Decomposition of the energy per residue in the interaction between the RBD
of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. (a) The top-ten per-residue binding energy determined by
the screening MM/PBSA (in=2.0), most of the residues were near the binding site (b);
(c) The top-ten per-residue binding energy determined by the standard MM/PBSA
(in=6.0), most of the residues were far away from the binding site (d).

We then calculated the free energy of SARS-CoV binding to ACE2 by using the
MM/PBSA (Table S2). Similar to SARS-CoV-2, the RBD of SARS-CoV also carries a
net charge of +2e, thus the free energy predicted by standard MM/PBSA was still very
low due to the strong electrostatic energy (even using a large dielectric constant 6.0).
Notably, the free energy of SARS-CoV binding to ACE2 was lower than that of SARSCoV-2 binding to ACE2 in standard MM/PBSA (Figure 2), which was inconsistent with
the experiment result. On the contrary, the free energy of SARS-CoV binding to ACE2
was about -11.4 kal/mol in screening MM/PBSA, which was close to the experiment
result (-10.1 kal/mol), and was a bit weaker than the predicted free energy of SARSCoV-2 binding to ACE2 (-13.3 kcal/mol), which was probably due to the weaker

electrostatic interactions.[18-20] It is well known that the transmissibility of COVID-2019
is higher than that of SARS-2003.[51-52] Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may have greater ability of
entering cell hosts than SARS-CoV. Apart from the unique ‘RRAR’ furin cleavage site
at the S1–S2 boundary,[8,10] the SARS-CoV-2 may have a higher binding affinity (to
ACE2), which is supported by our simulation result. Similar to previous case, here we
also analyzed the key residues in the SARS-CoV/ACE2 interaction via the residue
energy decomposition. Not surprisingly, the standard MM/PBSA showed the wrong
trend (i.e., the residues of top ten binding energies were far away from the binding sites
and the binding energy per residue was very strong), while the screening MM/PBSA
again gave a reasonable result (see Figure S6).
In general, the above results demonstrated that the screening effect between the
charged biomolecules should be considered in calculating the binding free energy,
particularly when the biomolecules carried a lot of net charges.
The SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies primarily target the RBD on spike proteins.
The binding affinity (of the antibody to RBD) is one of the most important factors in
evaluating potential clinic use of an antibody. Here, we first calculated the free energy
of SARS-CoV-2 binding to two recently reported antibodies (i.e., CR3022 and CB6)
using the screening MM/PBSA. As shown in Figure 4 (see details in Table S3 and Table
S4), the free energy of SARS-CoV-2 binding to CR3022 was -11.3 kcal/mol, and that
of SARS-CoV-2 binding to CB6 was -17.4 kcal/mol, which consisted with the
experimental findings (i.e., -9.5 kcal/mol,[13] -11.7 kal/mol,[11] respectively) in ranking,
again indicating the good performance of the screening MM/PBSA. Notably, although
the electrostatic energy in the case of CR3022 was stronger than that in the case of CB6,
the larger PB energy and the weaker VDW energy led to the weaker binding affinity of
CR3022 to SARS-CoV-2.

Figure 4. The comparison of the free energy among the standard MM/PBSA (using
different in), the screening MM/PBSA (in=2.0), and the experiment result in the
cases of SARS-CoV-2 RBD/CB6 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD/CR3022. The standard
deviation for the simulation data were obtained by three independent runs. The
experimental data for CB6 and CR3022 was taken from ref. [11] and ref. [13],
respectively.

We further evaluated the accuracy of standard MM/PBSA in this case. Unfortunately,
although the standard MM/PBSA predicted a comparative binding energy (-15.5
kcal/mol for CR3022 and -0.8 kcal/mol for CB6) to that in the experiment (-9.5
kcal/mol and -11.7 kcal/mol), it reported the wrong trend for the two antibodies at in
=2.0. When increasing in to 4.0 or 6.0, the standard MM/PBSA predicted the right trend
(i.e., ΔGCB6 < ΔGCR3022), but the binding free energy of CR3022 (to RBD) became
positive. In general, the performance of standard MM/PBSA was still poor in this case.
Having demonstrated that the screening MM/PBSA could provide relatively accurate
binding free energy, we further analyzed the key residues at the binding interface
between the antibodies CR3022/CB6 and SARS-CoV-2 and investigated whether the
binding affinity of antibodies could be enhanced or weakened with the computational
alanine scanning method.
The residue contacting probability of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 was first
calculated, where the residues at the interface were illustrated in Figure S7. Obviously,

the heavy chain in both antibodies was of the great importance since there are 23 (17)
residues of the heavy chain and only 6 (9) residues of the light chain in the binding sites
in the case of CB6 (CR3022). The contact surface area of the heavy chains with SARSCoV-2 was also much larger than that of the light chains (Figure 5a-b). More
importantly, Figure S8 shows that 63% of the epitopes (i.e., SARS-CoV-2/ACE2
binding sites) was occupied by CB6, which could greatly decrease the probability of
SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2. On the contrary, no epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 were
occupied by CR3022. Nevertheless, the epitopes of RBD that CR3022 targets are highly
conserved between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, thus CR3022 or some like
antibodies may have the potential of serving as a universal antibody for
coronaviruses.[12-13]
To provide more detailed insight into the interaction of the antibody with the RBD
of SARS-CoV-2, we took the CB6 as an example and identified the hot-spot residues
with the computational alanine scanning method (see Table S5). Figure 5c shows that
there were four hot spots (ΔΔG >2.0 kcal/mol) and seven warm spots (1.0 kcal/mol <
ΔΔG < 2.0 kcal/mol) in CB6 at the binding interface. Most of the hot (4/4) and warm
spots (6/7) were in the heavy chain, again indicating the important role of the heavy
chain in neutralizing the antigen in CB6. Moreover, we also investigated the effect of
the residue mutation of epitopes in RBD on the binding affinity since SARS-CoV-2 is
believed to mutate more quickly than some other viruses. It was found that most of the
hot and warm spots were dominated by the VDW interaction (Table S5), and there was
a large hydrophobic domain in the CB6-RBD interaction (see the blue circle in Figure
5d). Moreover, the hydrogen bonds also played an important role in the interaction. For
example, the highest value of ΔΔG in CB6 was R97 in the heavy chain, which formed
two hydrogen bonds with N487 in SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5d). Moreover, the highest
value of ΔΔG in SARS-CoV-2 was R403, which also formed two hydrogen bonds with
Y92 in the light chain of CB6.
We further made an attempt to evaluate whether and how the mutations (to the other
residues) in the antibody could improve the binding affinity since the antibody could
mutate quickly in B cells.[53] As discussed above, the interaction of R403, R408 in RBD

with Y92, P95 in the light chain of CB6 and the hydrophobic contacts between the RBD
and the heavy chain in CB6 were both important. Considering that R403 and R408 are
positively charged, it may be further enhanced when Y92 and P95 mutated to negatively
charged residues. Moreover, increasing the aromatic residues at the hydrophobic
contact region may also have the probability of increasing the binding affinity. The
above inference was indeed verified as shown in Figure S9.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed a new method (i.e., screening MM/PBSA) to evaluate
the binding free energy between SARS-CoV-2 RBD, ACE2 as well as two antibodies.
It was found that the free energies of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 and SARS-CoV RBD
to ACE2 calculated by standard MM/PBSA were much lower than the experimental
result and even showed the wrong trend. By introducing the screening electrostatic

energy in MM/PBSA, the calculating free energies were in good agreement with the
experimental result. Moreover, we evaluated the performance of the screening
MM/PBSA on the binding affinity of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and found that
the predicted binding free energy also agreed with the experimental findings (the
performance of standard MM/PBSA was still poor in this case). In general, the
screening MM/PBSA can give a more reliable prediction of the binding free energy of
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-involved interactions, and should have great potential in evaluating
the protein-protein interaction in highly charged bio-systems.
