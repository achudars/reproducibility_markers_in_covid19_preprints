This work addresses the issues involved in providing robust certification for COVID-19 immunity (assuming the biological premise
of ‘immunity’ is ultimately confirmed). Methods: We developed a prototype mobile phone app and scalable distributed server
architecture that facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally identifiable information is only stored at the
user’s discretion, and the app allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with no other personal
information revealed. Behind the scenes it relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called ‘Verifiable
Credentials’, (b) Tim Berners-Lee’s decentralized personal data platform ‘Solid’, and (c) a consortium Ethereum-based blockchain.
Results: Our architecture enables verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and digital signatures,
generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive digital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to scale
linearly in the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. doctor,
pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is ‘just another app’ which takes only minutes to use. Conclusions: The app and
distributed server architecture offer a prototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, widely applicable to personal health
records and beyond, and in effect ‘waiting in the wings’ for the biological issues, plus key ethical issues raised in the discussion
section, to be resolved.

Abstract—Goal: As the Coronavirus Pandemic of
2019/2020 unfolds, a COVID-19 ‘Immunity Passport’ has
been mooted as a way to enable individuals to return back
to work. While the quality of antibody testing, the availability of vaccines, and the likelihood of even attaining
COVID-19 immunity continue to be researched, we address
the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacypreserving certification for test results and vaccinations.
Methods: We developed a prototype mobile phone app and
requisite decentralized server architecture that facilitates
instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally
identifiable information is only stored at the user’s discretion, and the app allows the end-user selectively to present
only the specific test result with no other personal information revealed. The architecture, designed for scalability,
relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called ‘Verifiable Credentials’, (b) Tim Berners-Lee’s
decentralized personal data platform ‘Solid’, and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our mobile
phone app and decentralized server architecture enable
the mixture of verifiability and privacy in a manner derived
from public/private key pairs and digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive digital
keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to
scale linearly in the worst case, as significant processing is
done locally on each app. For the test certificate Holder,
Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g.
employer), it is ‘just another app’ which takes only minutes
to use. Conclusions: The app and decentralized server architecture offer a prototype proof of concept that is readily
scalable, applicable generically, and in effect ‘waiting in the
wings’ for the biological issues, plus key ethical issues
raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.
Index Terms—Blockchain, COVID-19, coronavirus, decentralized, immunity certification.
Impact Statement—As soon as COVID-19 antibody testing, vaccines, and likelihood of immunity surpass quality

I. INTRODUCTION
HE Coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic of 2019/2020 is
still taking its terrible toll as we write this [1]. Tests for
the presence of antibodies could offer a way for people who can
prove COVID-19 immunity to go back to work [2], [3]. There
are, however, challenges concerning the biological premise of
‘immunity’: the strength and longevity of COVID-19 immunity
after infection are matters of current debate and research, as are
the sensitivity and robustness of the relevant tests [4], [5] and
the race to develop a viable vaccine [6], [7].
Given the scale of the pandemic and financial fallout, it is
plausible that ‘COVID-19 antibody test / vaccination certification’ (henceforth ‘CAT/VC’), if shown to be robust, will be in
great demand. Bearing in mind the legal and ethical implications
of such certification, raised in [8], [9] and our Discussion, we
feel that for either the current pandemic or a pandemic of the
future, the concept of certification has a place, particularly
when the recipient is employed in healthcare or other key
sectors.
But what form should certification take? A signed or stamped
letter is the centuries-old default, and straightforward to roll out
at scale, as long as there is some point-of-test proof of identity.
Our approach is based on the view that for such a sensitive and
likely high-value certificate, a paper version is too vulnerable
to alteration or forgery (an exception arises in environments
that are ‘lower tech’ for socio-economic reasons and we later
describe a printed certificate to address this case). A digital
certificate makes the most sense, provided that it can be: (i)
Privacy-preserving (because as proud as the holder might be of
new-found ‘immunity’, personal data can be re-purposed in unpredictable ways [10]), (ii) un-forgeable, (iii) easy to administer,
(iv) easily verifiable while still preserving privacy, (v) scalable
to millions of users, and (vi) cost-effective.
All of this effort would be wasted without public acceptance,
which is increasingly challenging in an era of suspicion about
data-collecting apps [11]. Toward this end, we argue not only
for the decentralized approach underlying our design and implementation below, but also for its benefits in allowing individuals
who have been tested to change their minds and quit the scheme,
knowing that even cryptographically encoded data will be ‘orphaned’ (no data pointing to it), rendering it meaningless. Also,

in the Supplementary Materials, we emphasize the importance
of having strong oversight by an ethics watchdog to ensure best
endeavours to avoid unleashing a Pandora’s Box of undesirable
side-effects.
How best to undertake such a challenge? Modern smartphone apps and several key technologies such as public key
cryptosystems and immutable blockchain records offer some
tantalizing prospects for the path we envisage, if they can satisfy
the above criteria. Below, we look at the methods by which this
can be achieved, assuming a scenario involving testing by a
known authority (e.g. a healthcare practitioner or pharmacist),
as opposed to self-testing at home. This main paper assumes an
‘On-Site Test for Antibodies + Issuance of Digital Certificate
Including Photo ID’ in order to explain our approach, and
in the Supplementary Materials we describe variations for (a)
‘Issuing Digital Certificate Without Photo ID’, (b) ‘Issuing Paper
Certificate’, (c) ‘Off-Site Testing Via External Lab’, and (d)
‘Vaccination + Certification’
II. METHODS
We focus on the design and implementation of a prototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture,
intended to facilitate verification of tamper-proof test results.
Our design involves a novel hybrid architecture based on (a)
the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called ‘Verifiable Credentials’, (b) Tim Berners-Lee’s decentralized personal
data platform ‘Solid’, and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based
blockchain. We work through (d) a plausible use case scenario,
then (e) describe the key ‘onboarding’ and certification steps
in detail; and (f) provide benchmark tests to anticipate scaling
performance.
A. ‘Verifiable Credentials’ For Digital Certification
Verifiable Credentials [12] is a W3C standard that builds
upon Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the public/private key
pairs that facilitate digital signatures in widespread use today.
The W3C extensions standardize the definitions of document
formats to make them machine-readable and communicable,
and to generalize PKI, which tends to be costly and highly
centralized. The generalization involves a decentralized registry
for cryptographic keys, typically residing in a blockchain — this
allows every public key to have its own unique address, known as
a Decentralized Identifier (DID). The key roles and transactions,
adapted for our specific use case, are illustrated in Fig. 1.
The ‘Issuer’, in our case a trusted pharmacy or the UK National Health Service (NHS), can issue credentials such as blood
test results and vaccination certificates. ‘Holders’ (typically
citizen end-users) can store them in their own preferred way,
for example in digital wallets that are part of a mobile phone
app. ‘Verifiers’, such as employers, or establishments seeking
proof of some attribute, can ask the Holder to present such
proof concerning these credentials. Verifiers also check digital
signatures against what is known as a ‘verifiable (decentralized)
data registry’: this is the blockchain where the DIDs mentioned
above reside.

B. ‘Solid’: Decentralized Personal Data
We pointed out in [13] that the over-centralization of data,
particularly its consolidation into ‘silos’ by brand-name IT
services and social network providers, is of increasing concern.
Decentralization is an ideal starting point for storing sensitive
data, including medical, financial, and other personal data — but
only if security and privacy are significantly better than what can
be offered by traditional centralized systems.
We identified a promising approach to widespread deployment, known as Solid, initiated by Sir Tim Berners-Lee [14],
[15]. Solid aims to decentralize the Web by transferring control
of data from a central authority to users, thereby allowing users
to retain complete ownership of their data, which they store in
what are called ‘Solid Pods’ — analogous to a personal web
server that is hosted either locally on a mobile phone, or hosted
with a cloud provider of the individual’s choice, or both. The
key distinction from centralized approaches is that even in the
provider-hosted case, the provider’s access to the data is limited
by the user’s preferences.
In [16] we proposed an approach combining Solid Pods
and distributed ledgers, of the type familiar to the blockchain
community, to facilitate the complete decentralization of data.
The key ingredients of this combination are illustrated in Fig. 2,
which also provides an overview of the main test/certify/verify
life cycle. Our methods give users total control over their data
while maintaining the integrity of the stored information through
blockchain-based verification.
As in Fig. 1, the ‘Holder’ is the primary individual who is selfmotivated to obtain the certificate of COVID-19 antibody test
results in order to be admitted to a workplace or other location.
Holders own, manage, and control their own Solid Pods (shown
as hexagons in the Holder’s mobile phone in Fig. 2 at A, E, and
F), which contain their personal data. In Fig. 2, our Holder’s
Solid Pod contains a elements of a physical ID such as a driving
license (‘thumbprint’ icon at A) and the Holder’s signed and
countersigned certificate of COVID-19 antibody test results —
represented in Fig. 2 as a document in which is embedded a
special QR code (F). The Holder is free to store the Solid Pod data
on his/her mobile phone, on a personal favorite cloud provider, or
both (we only show the mobile phone version for simplicity). At
any time, Holders can move or delete data, as it remains under

their ownership. One-way encoded ‘hashes’ of the data (only
a few bytes in size) are held, as shown by the dashed arrows
in Fig. 2 (E and H), on a blockchain to support independent
verification.
C. Consortium Blockchain
In our design, we use a ‘Consortium blockchain’, shown in
Fig. 2(B) as circles (depicting multiple replicated blockchain
nodes receding into the distance): this is not a fully public
blockchain like Ethereum or Bitcoin, but rather a blockchain
shared specifically by a Consortium of known providers
who have signed up to the Ethics Guidelines we describe
in the Discussion Section. The Open University-led Consortium blockchain is a private Ethereum network known as
OpenEthereum (formerly Parity Ethereum) [17], [18] which
uses a ‘Proof of Authority’ consensus mechanism [19] wherein
several nodes can be in the mutually-agreed privileged position
of being allowed to confirm transactions. As we go to press,
our Consortium blockchain comprises nodes run by The Open
University, BT, Condatis, Inrupt, and the Chiba Institute of
Technology near Tokyo, with expansion planned as our prototype implementation is scaled up via other large-company
partnerships now under discussion. This approach contrasts
with that of Bitcoin and other early blockchains which use
the slow and ecologically unfriendly Proof of Work, wherein
massive computing power enables nodes to have a better chance
of confirming transactions. The Consortium approach gives us
the kind of distributed scalability that increases security, but
without the widespread public availability that may serve as a
disincentive for individuals to participate.
D. Use Case Scenario
In our scenario, the Issuer (Pharmacy) needs to authenticate
that the Holder is who they say they are, and thus requests that
the Holder display (a) a physical ID, such as a Driving License
or a Passport, and (b) a QR code which is scanned by the Issuer
using the Issuer’s mobile phone app, both of which are shown
in Fig. 2 (C). At this point the Issuer taps to accept the ID, and

the Holder’s photo is ‘burned’ into the upcoming steps so that
at the final step of verification there will be no need to display
the same physical ID. The next steps are as follows:
2) The blood test is performed, and the certificate with results
is issued as soon as the results are available (off-site lab
tests are dealt with in the Supplementary Materials). The
Issuer (first scanning a printed QR code if preferred)
generates a digitally-signed test result as a new QR code
(labelled D in Fig. 2) for transmission to the Holder,
thereby providing a Verifiable Credential which is digitally signed by both the Issuer and the Holder, and stored
on the Holder’s Solid Pod (Fig. 2, D and E). At label E we
also see that a hash of the Verifiable Credential is stored
on the Consortium blockchain to facilitate verification at
step 3.
3) The Holder can now present a provably valid certificate
to the Verifier. To avoid someone else impersonating the
Holder, the Holder’s ID photo was already ‘burned’ into
the digital certificate at Step 1, so the Holder needs to
present only the QR code (F and G in Fig. 2)
At H in Fig. 2 we see that the Verifier’s app automatically
verifies both digital signatures and the certificate against the hash
stored on the Consortium blockchain, and confirms acceptance
of the COVID-19 Antibody Test Certificate. The certificate
stores quantitative test results, such as antibody type (e.g. ‘IgG’)
and level, so it is up to the Verifier’s own contextually guided
procedures to decide whether to admit the Holder, for example,
to work.
E. Primary design (Onboarding and Certification)
Below we separately describe the details for (i) ‘Onboarding’
for Issuers, Holders and Verifiers, and (ii) how Certification
works behind the scenes. The companion step of (iii) Verification
is conceptually similar, and thus provided separately in the
Supplementary Materials, as are the more straightforward descriptions of the server and mobile app functional architectures.
1) Onboarding: There are three entities involved in the operations: Issuers, Holders and Verifiers. The onboarding process
lets all of them install and configure the app. The configuration process for each of them is distinct and requires specific
documentation.
Issuers: The onboarding of a potential Issuer (Fig. 3) begins
with the person downloading and installing the app. The app
then instructs the Issuer to complete an in-app form. Because
the Issuer has the ability to test, validate and issue certificates
to individuals, the app employs two factor authentication for
all potential Issuers. We anticipate using the API provided
by the General Pharmaceutical Council, or an equivalent, to
cross-check the registration and the branch information of the
likely Issuer (this is simulated in our prototype — discussions
about API access are underway), followed by email verification.
The former requires the person to input appropriate information
into the form, while the latter asks the potential Issuer to provide
a valid official email address at the company’s registered domain
name. The app sends a special link to that Issuer’s email address
to complete the registration. Data provided by the potential
Issuers resides on each Issuer’s Solid Pod.

Verifier onboarding timeline details.

Holders: The process of onboarding a Holder (Fig. 4) involves adding an identification document such as a driving
license or passport. The document number is used to generate the
Decentralized ID (DID) that acts as the anchor for the Holder. A
potential Holder first downloads and installs the app followed by
adding a photo of the identification document. This document
resides in the Holder’s Solid Pod. This photo document is
deemed permanent (but remains on their personal Solid Pod) and
once submitted, cannot be changed again. The app then provides
the Holder with the DID, leaving the owner of the account ready
for testing and certification.
Verifiers: Of the three main roles, the process of onboarding
Verifiers is the most straightforward. Anyone willing to act as
a Verifier can download the app and start verifying. There is no
need to create an account for verifying a Holder’s certificate. As
the Verifier submits no data, the steps of the Verifier onboarding
timeline (Fig. 5) do not involve Solid Pods.
2) Certification: The certification process requires a Holder
to visit an Issuer with the exact document used for identification
at the time of onboarding. At this point the Issuer matches
this document with the copy stored in the Holder’s Solid Pod,
viewing it on the app and tapping to accept the ID. The Holder’s
photo is ‘burned’ into the upcoming steps so that at the final
step of verification, there will be no need to display the same
physical ID. In Fig. 6, we see the ‘behind the scenes’ view of
certification, including the Holder’s Solid Pod with the ID.
The app is designed to work in a completely decentralized
environment. Its functionalities run across the Issuer’s, Holder’s,
and Verifier’s phones as well as on the hosting servers, but does
not have access to any data from a central database. Every
time the app needs to execute an operation, it reads the data
from a particular user’s Solid Pod (and only with the user’s
permission). In Fig. 6, at (A) we see that the app reads the allowed
identity details from the Holder’s Solid Pod, and at (B) compares

151

their hash with the corresponding hash on the blockchain and
confirms this on the Issuer’s phone display.
Once the identity is confirmed, via physical document checks
and Verifiable Credentials demonstrating ownership of the relevant DIDs, the Issuer conducts the antibody test and initiates
the process of generating a certificate at (C). A certificate is a set
of data in W3C RDF (Resource Description Framework) format
[20] containing the test results and a Verifiable Credential for
the just-tested Holder. While the hash of the certificate goes onto
the blockchain at (D), the original document resides in the Solid
Pod (E). It is notable that neither the blockchain nor a third-party
centralized server stores the personal data of the Holder.
The Holder has the option of keeping a copy of the certificate
in a cloud server of his or her choice. In the event of losing
the phone, the Holder can retrieve the data from the cloud and
restore the certificate in the regenerated local Solid Pod of the
replacement phone. This certificate is visible on the Holder’s
app in the form of a QR code, giving an easy-to-scan option for
Verifiers.
3) Verification: The innards of Verification are conceptually
similar to what we have just shown for Certification and are thus
provided separately in the Supplementary Materials.
F. Benchmark Testing
To anticipate scalability, we benchmarked three operations
(Issuing, Verifying, and Uploading) against a baseline ping that
simply echoed a response following a request.
For both Issuing and Verifying we used two variants, to assess
the difference between generating hashes (a) locally within the
mobile phone app and (b) externally on a server before adding
to the blockchain. The Uploading times are purely the times for
uploading a certificate to a Solid Pod stored in the cloud, in case
that is the Holder’s preference.

A. COVID-19 Antibody Test Certification:
App Characteristics
Our ‘COVID-19 antibody test certification’ (CAT/VC) app
builds upon the Verifiable Credentials and Solid frameworks

described in Section II, plus our own expertise developed over
the past 5 years in the area of blockchain-based certification [21],
[22]. The result combines the following characteristics:
r Wholly resident on the end-user’s smartphone, yet usable
as a paper-only certificate in appropriate socio-economic
contexts, as described in the Supplementary Materials.
r One-tap scan, display, and verification of antibody test
results, which are owned by the user.
r The app only reveals verifiable CAT/VC results without
revealing any personally sensitive information, at the discretion of the user.
r The details of Verifiable Credentials, Solid Pods, and
Ethereum blockchain are hidden: from the user’s point
of view, it is ‘just another app’.

‘Issuing LH’), but more twice that for Verifying (17.1% difference between ‘Verifying SH and ‘Verifying LH’). This behavior
is understandable, as Issuing requires writing on the blockchain
through transactions (i.e. the method that allows adding an entry
to the distributed ledger) while Verifying involves only a look
up at a particular ledger entry.
Linear growth for all operations indicates that our architecture is capable of handling scale-up without surprise: there is
simply no inter-node or inter-app communication or interaction
overhead, so by improving the configuration of the common
infrastructures in the architecture, such as any Solid cloud server,
blockchain node, or any other intermediate element, the architecture can serve more parallel requests, i.e. reduce the response
time. Implications and additional results are discussed below
and in the Supplementary Materials.

B. Performance Benchmarking Results
Fig. 7 shows the time to completion in seconds (Y axis) of all
six operations where we sent between 1 and 100 simultaneous
requests (X axis): the fastest (baseline) ping is the lowest line.
Uploading is the second least expensive operation, while Verifying and Issuing are the two most expensive operations of our
app. The relative difference in time between operations involving
locally generated hash (LH) and server-generated hash (SH) is
modest for Issuing (6.9% difference between ‘Issuing SH’ and

IV. DISCUSSION
A. Deployment, Integration, and Scale
Our focus is on trusted certification, and for this reason we remain committed to deployments involving nationally approved
locations such as pharmacies or UK National Health Service
surgeries rather than home testing (off-site lab tests are described
in the Supplementary Materials). With our approach, deploying

Hash) and Uploading of Solid Pod data vs baseline standard ‘Ping’.

the decentralized servers requires another dozen or so Consortium members in addition to the five already engaged, plus about
two days of training, which can be handled in parallel for all
Consortium members via webinars, as we already do in our
current work with blockchain-based educational certification
[23]. The mobile phone app itself requires just a download
and less than 30 minutes of training for Issuers, and even less
for Verifiers and Holders—we anticipate developing a video
tutorial for all scenarios. More significantly is the ‘buy-in’ i.e.
acceptance by certified pharmacies and, in the UK, the National
Health Service, and integration with existing work practice,
ethics guideline approval, and agreement about what, if any,
data needs to be stored centrally (no central storage is required
at all by our approach). For a full-scale rollout, it would be
necessary to further stress-test our prototype along the lines we
have already started as described in the preceding Sections.
The technology itself is inherently scalable as our Results section shows: transactions on the Consortium blockchain typically
take under 5 seconds to be confirmed after entry by the Issuer,
after which other steps such as verification are subjectively
instantaneous. This scales well, as the architecture is inherently
distributed across servers (blockchain nodes) and mobile phone
apps. Moreover, we have shown worst case results, covering
the case when (a) all Solid servers are hosted on the same
machine, (b) all blockchain transactions are being sent to the

same specific node, and (c) all users are acting simultaneously.
In the best case scenario, all simultaneous users would connect
to their own Solid servers, and any simultaneous blockchain
transactions would each involve different blockchain nodes, so
performance overhead would be constant for each additional
user. Realistically, i.e. in between these cases, there would be
ample numbers of Solid servers, many dozens to hundreds of
blockchain nodes, and natural spacing between transactions, and
thus performance overhead for each additional user would be
minimal.
Collaborative possibilities for rollout and integration are
promising, as new initiatives in this niche are rapidly emerging
[24].
B. Beyond Antibody Test Certification
Our scenario highlights antibody testing, but the technology
is identical for vaccination certification, as we describe in the
Supplementary Materials — this may prove even more popular once vaccines have been suitably tested and approved [6],
[7]. The app and decentralized server architecture are readily
scalable and applicable generically. For example,
r People could demonstrate that they are eligible to use
different methods of transport or to visit public places such
as libraries, theaters, or holiday destinations.

154

r Utility/building/repair staff seeking access to a place of
residence, even in ‘normal’ healthy times, could ‘prove
their roles’.
r More generally, the entire area of ‘Decentralized Verifiable
Personal Health Records’, as described in [25], particularly if augmented by the W3C Verifiable Credentials
standard [12], can benefit from the approach described
herein.

REFERENCES

New technologies bring new challenges for society. Commentators have argued (e.g. in [8], [9], [26]), that certification
of the type we have envisaged, even when totally private and
tamper-proof, would entail multiple risks, notably: (a) disenfranchising the poor and others who do not have access to the
technology or the tests, or have access but ‘fail’ the test, and (b)
becoming a stepping-stone for future governments to deploy the
same concept either to enable or to enforce discrimination based
on immunity and other arbitrary conditions. To avoid this technology becoming ‘weaponized’ for discriminatory purposes, we
advocate several measures including optional rather than mandatory use, adherence with UK NHS Information Governance
guidelines [27], [28] and oversight by an Ethics Committee.
This issue is analyzed in detail in the Supplementary Materials.

V. CONCLUSION
The perceived need for a COVID-19 Antibody Test / Vaccination Certificate, if shown to be biologically robust and to
conform to proposed ethical guidelines, has motivated us to
develop a mobile phone app based around Verifiable Credentials, distributed storage of cryptographic public/key pairs, and
the decentralized verification of data with confidentiality. This
has enabled us to provide a facility that is ‘just another app’
from the viewpoint of the end-user, healthcare professionals,
employers and other relevant authorities — thereby providing
a tamper-proof record owned entirely by the end-user, and
allowing the end-user selectively to reveal solely the proof of
test results without surrendering other personal information (e.g.
age, address, blood type, other discovered antibodies or immune
deficiencies or other inadvertent revelations in the data set, for
which certificate Holders may have no idea how this information
might be used by someone else in the future), and requiring only
mobile phone app downloads from everyone in the loop. This
app and its secure digital certificate thus become a powerful adjunct/enhancement to traditional paper-based certification from
the NHS or Pharmaceutical testing authorities — and without
the need for the costly installation of special ‘e-ticket reader’
hardware: the same mobile phone app is sufficient for the task
at hand, regardless of which of the three roles is involved. Many
other uses of secure and private certification via mobile phone
app and decentralized servers are additionally made possible,

I. INTRODUCTION

this supplementary materials section we provide the
following extras: Introduction — more about the premise of
immunity; Methods — (a) how we achieve robust privacy,
(b) more details about how Verification works and the
functional architecture and mobile phone app infrastructure,
(c) scenario variations for (i) Issuing a Digital Certificate
Without Photo ID, (ii) Issuing a Paper Certificate, (iii) OffSite Testing Via an External Lab, and (iv) Vaccination +
Certification; Results — additional aspects of system
performance; Discussion — further observations about rollout
and ethical issues.
The premise of immunity: Throughout most of the
COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organisation (WHO)
has advocated a ‘test-isolate-trace’ approach [1]. In parallel,
there has been a worldwide cooperative effort to develop a
vaccine [2] and to develop numerous serological tests for the
presence of antibodies [3]. If immunity is strongly implied by
the outcomes of these latter tests, then individuals could be
allowed to get back to work, particularly in healthcare and
other key areas [4], [5]. The WHO initially warned that the
very premise of COVID-19 immunity was itself uncertain [6].
Yet the fast pace of research is already showing promising
signs that early testing was flawed, the presence of antibodies
in recovered individuals has been confirmed, and re-infection
now seems increasingly unlikely [7], [8]. True, some
immunologists have argued that COVID-19 immunity could
be very weak, because ‘reinfection is an issue with the four
seasonal coronaviruses that cause about 10% to 30% of
common colds’ [9]. But others in that same discussion argue
that immunity could be valid for ‘a year or two’, a view shared
by Male, who with Golding and Bootman has written a clear
exposition on the life-cycle of infection, antibody detection,
and likely immunity to COVID-19 [10]. A related challenge is
the quality of the testing: test sensitivity (% positive detection
for the right antibodies, so high sensitivity means few false
positives) and specificity (% negatives correctly detected, so
high specificity means few false negatives) are undergoing
great scrutiny even as we write this [11], and are naturally a
matter of concern, because they must be sufficiently high to
make the approach worthwhile. In the meantime, our research
aims to find an approach to achieve highly robust certification,
so that it is ready to deploy as-and-when the ongoing
biological research satisfies the necessary quality criteria.
N

II. METHODS
A. The design of robust privacy
Several important guidelines concerning privacy were set
out by the Sovrin Foundation, a nonprofit organisation with
over 70 corporate partners including IBM, Cisco and others,
which has the aim of ‘driving greater interoperability and a
new trust model for securely sharing private information’ [12].
We adopt a variation of the three principles set out in the
Sovrin.org White Paper [13], modifying their item 2 as shown
below.
1) Pairwise-unique DIDs and public keys
As Sovrin.org explains, ‘Imagine that when you open a new
account with an online merchant, instead of giving them a
credit card number or phone number, you gave them a DID
created just for them. They could still use this DID to contact
you about your order, or to charge you a monthly
subscription, but not for anything else. If […] your DID were
compromised in any way, you would just cancel it and give
them a new one—without affecting any other relationship.
[consequently…] a pairwise-pseudonymous DID is not worth
stealing.’ [13]
2) Minimum and Encoded Data Storage / User’s Choice
According to [13], no private data should be stored on the
ledger, even in hashed form, to make it future-attack-proof.
Sovrin accepts, as do we, the need for pseudonymous
identifiers (DIDs), pseudonymous public keys, and agent
addresses (e.g. the mobile phone app endpoints) to be stored in
a decentralized ledger, but in addition we offer the user a
choice regarding whether and where to host personal
information (mobile phone, favorite cloud provider, or both),
plus the barest minimum for verification purposes, namely
hashes (irreversible encodings) of private data. This has the
following benefits:
• Serves as a user-storage ‘vault’ for later recovery in
case of loss.
• This ‘vault’ (i.e. the Solid Pod) can reside on the user’s
phone, or on a favorite cloud provider, or both — it is
always the user’s choice.
• To facilitate later independent verification, it uses a
blockchain with distributed nodes run by a Consortium
of trusted providers so that there is neither a single
point of failure nor a single ‘owner’ even of the hash of
the certificate.

• Even so, it only stores a hash on the Consortium
blockchain — a non-reversible but provably correct
encoding of the certificate rather than the certificate
itself.
This is a powerful privacy-preserving and tamper-proof
approach that we call Minimum and Encoded Data Storage /
User’s Choice. Verborgh [14] has a deeper discussion of the
nature and importance of these types of emerging paradigm
shifts.
3) Selective disclosure
It is essential that users (certificate Holders) should only
have to reveal just the portions of their own personally-held
private data that are relevant to specific transactions (e.g.
proving that you are 18 years of age or older, in order to make
certain purchases or access certain locations, but without
revealing your actual age or date of birth). This is made
possible by the technology known as cryptographic zero
knowledge proofs [15–17], so named because they provide, to
the Verifier who wishes to know, proof of something specific
(such as ‘Age ≥ 18’), but with the Verifier having no
knowledge of any other details, in this case actual age or date
of birth. The ‘secret sauce’ of zero knowledge proofs, as
illustrated in [16], [17], is that a mathematical function works
through a proof of some fact (such as age being greater than or
equal to X, or the existence of a certain credential), in such a
way that the actual steps involved in executing the proof only

reach a positive outcome if the fact is true (for example, the
positive outcome may require a certain number of steps to
execute): so the proof is valid, but still only indirect (e.g.
counting the steps executed) without touching the raw data
[15], [16].
B. Verification and implementation details
This section describes the operations that underpin the
functioning of verification, as well as the overall
implementation infrastructure and mobile phone app.
1) Verification
The process of verifying a certificate is an on-demand
action. A Verifier cannot validate a certificate unless
requested. It requires a Holder to go to a Verifier for this
purpose. A Verifier can be an employer or other individual or
organisation to whom the Holder wants or needs to present the
certificate. Fig. S1 shows the main data flows involved in
Verification.
In Fig. S1, we see that once requested, at (A), the app reads
the QR code from the Holder’s phone. This QR code (which is
generated from the data that itself is stored in the Solid Pod)
has two components: the certificate and a URL pointing to the
hash on the blockchain. At (B), the app extracts these
components and at (C) locally generates a temporary hash of
the certificate. Finally (D), the app fetches the hash stored on
the blockchain and compares it with the local hash. The

scanned by the Holder’s mobile phone app.

matching of the hashes indicates the validity and the
authenticity of the certificate stored in the Solid Pod of the
Holder. At the same time, the physical identity of the Holder
can be confirmed by the Verifier via the Holder’s photo ID
which will already have been ‘burned’ into the mobile phone
app certificate. The digital identity of the Holder can be
confirmed by verifying the Verifiable Credential (embedded in
the certificate) based on the relevant Holder DID.
2) The functional infrastructure
The components of our implementation communicate with
each other via current Web standards — Hypertext Transfer
Protocol Secure (HTTPS), RDF (primarily in the JSON-LD
format), Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identifiers
— and via blockchain protocols (specifically, Ethereum
protocols). The volumes of data and computational
requirements are typically small and can be handled by a
mobile device (full blockchain nodes are an exception, due to
the potential size of the full chain data).
The main software functions required by the
implementation are as follows:
Generate QR codes: Implemented using standard
libraries to generate QR codes for identity and
immunity certificates.
Generate hashes: Using standard libraries,
certificates are transformed into a canonical RDF

format before hashing, in order to ensure robust
reproducibility of hashes, for verification.
Communicate with Blockchain: The Parity library is
used to communicate with our Consortium
blockchain. A light client library can handle
read/write interactions with the blockchain without
requiring a phone to maintain a full copy of the
blockchain.
Communicate with Solid Pods: Communication with
Solid takes place using the Solid REST API [18], to
read and write personal data regarding the Holder to
and from their Solid Pod with user permission.
Manage Issuer and Holder Credentials: Issuer and
Holder credentials are stored in public/private key
wallets containing DIDs. The authorization for an
Issuer to create certificates can be represented as a
Verifiable Credential issued by the relevant
regulatory authority to the Issuer, which any
participating party can verify. Currently we use
Streetcred ID [19] to generate DIDs for the Issuers,
Holders and Certificates.
Generate Verifiable Credentials: Certificates are
created at issue time, and their contents asserted as
the Claim elements in Verifiable Credentials to be
stored in the Holder’s Solid Pod, with metadata
describing the relevant blockchain records forming
the Proof. This provides a sharable data structure
which permits anyone to check its authenticity.

3) The mobile phone app
Fig. S2 shows representative screen shots of the mobile
phone app, which provides all the necessary UI elements for
the Issuer, Holder and Verifier to perform their actions. At the
time of writing, the main functionalities of the mobile phone
app include the ability to scan and generate QR codes and
generate hashes for text and images. For the QR code scan and
generate functions to work, the mobile phone app is packed
with necessary libraries to support QR code functions and only
works on smartphones with built-in camera functionality. The
mobile phone app also contains the hashing libraries. As the
mobile phone app needs to communicate with a server, an
active internet connection is necessary for HTTPS server calls.
For speed of implementation for the current prototype, a
Node.js Express server does all the heavy lifting for the app,
with the functionalities explained above. This is a temporary
solution, however, given the urgency of the current situation.
C. Scenario variations
Throughout the paper we have focused on a scenario
involving ‘On-Site Test for Antibodies + Issuance of Digital
Certificate Including Photo ID’, but there are some key
variations easily incorporated into our design, namely (i)
‘Issuing Digital Certificate Without Photo ID’, (ii) ‘Issuing
Paper Certificate’, (iii) ‘Off-Site Testing Via External Lab’,
and (iv) ‘Vaccination + Certification’, described in turn below.
1) Variation 1: Issuing Digital Certificate Without Photo ID
In our scenario in the main paper, Fig. 2, the Issuer
(Pharmacy) needs to authenticate that the Holder is who they
say they are, and thus requests that the Holder display both a
physical ID, such as a Driving License or a Passport and also a
QR code which is scanned by the Issuer using the Issuer’s
mobile phone app. At this point there is in fact a choice: the
Issuer can either (a) tap to accept the ID, in which case the
Holder’s photo will be ‘burned’ into the upcoming steps so
that at the final step of verification, there will be no need to
display the same physical ID, or (b) leave the Holder to
display the physical ID once again at verification time.
If path (b) is chosen, there are other implications. At
Verification time, to avoid someone else impersonating the
Holder, the Holder must present not only the certificate, but
also some proof of identity. In this variation, the Verifier can
confirm the identity of the Holder by visually inspecting a
physical ID card, and separately scanning the Holder’s
presented QR code (without ID incorporated) to verify just the
certificate.
2) Variation 2: Issuing Paper Certificate
At step 2 of our main scenario, the test certificate can in fact
be provided purely on paper, which has a dual purpose for the
Holder: (a) a fallback in case of mobile phone failure; (b) a
‘tech-agnostic’ option which enables us to provide
certification in a more appropriate manner for cases of socioeconomic deprivation. This alternative means that some of the
advantage of digital certification will be missing, but the use

4

of printed QR codes which include the image of the Holder are
still a useful advance over plain paper certificates. It also
provides an alternative for individuals with little access to
technology, but for whom a paper-based QR code printout can
serve as a ‘good enough’ and ‘effectively tamper-proof’
certificate.
3) Variation 3: Off-Site Testing Via External Lab
It is likely that in many cases, particularly where large
volume or high-quality serology testing is required, the
Holder’s blood sample has to be sent to a separate lab for
processing. In this variation, the Pharmacist can issue a
certificate that is flagged as being in a ‘pending’ state. The lab
technician will also have a login to the app, via an additional
button on the login screen, and see the list of pending
certificates waiting for processing and approval. Once the lab
technician has the results for a blood sample, the technician
has to scan the QR code attached to the sample (this
incorporates the Holder’s digital ID, but with no personal
information exposed to the lab technician) and then tap a
button to issue the certified results to the relevant Holder. At
this point, the Holder receives a notification with details of the
certified result.
Note that the steps in this variation are just like the steps in
‘supply chain provenance’ gaining increasing traction in the
blockchain ‘farm-to-fork’ world, typified by the IBM Food
Trust [20]. Such efforts are also gaining ground in the area of
vaccine supply chain provenance [21]. At each step of the
chain, each participant adds the information pertinent to their
niche, and digitally signs, while cross-checking automatically
for authenticity of provenance at earlier steps in the supply
chain. For blood samples, both the issuer and lab technician
would add serial numbers and details for the blood sample and
containers, syringes as necessary, and respective registration
numbers / IDs for their roles as pharmacist and lab technician.
At Verifier stage, and even for the lab test manufacturer,
similar procedures would be deployed so that the integrity of
the whole testing life cycle was ensured.
4) Variation 4: Vaccination + Certification
Although the most forward-looking variation (because
vaccine research, development, approval, and deployment may
take the longest [2]), it fits very smoothly into our existing
scenario life cycles. Essentially, the Issuer as described
throughout the main section of the paper becomes the person
administering the vaccination jab (as opposed to taking a
blood sample), and certifying that this has happened in the
same manner described for the antibody test certificate. The
approach to ‘supply chain provenance’ discussed in the
preceding paragraph also applies to this variation, because the
Issuer will have to include details of the vaccination source
and batch within the certificate.

General Pharmaceutical Council to cross-check registration —
this of course is subject to approval, and relevant discussions
are already underway. As for the Consortium blockchain, a
strong Consortium of industrial and academic partners needs
to be established, after which addition of new members is just
a matter of approval by the existing Consortium and the
distribution of training and instruction materials.
Alternatively, ‘parallel’ consortia can be created by cloning
our approach. Given related ongoing work [22] that we
mentioned in the main paper, we are optimistic that critical
mass can be achieved.
Fig. S3. Operations per second for Issuing (Server vs Local hashing),
Verifying’ (Server vs Local hashing), Uploading and (baseline) ‘Pinging’.

III. RESULTS
Fig. S3 shows the number of operations per second
(Ops/sec) for Issuing, Verifying, Uploading, and Pinging,
calculated from the slope of the 1-100 parallel operations
timing described in the main paper. It demonstrates that while
the current configuration is constant, our architecture can
serve about five certificate issuances per second. For
verifications, although we experimented with both local and
server variants, in practice the hash will be generated locally
(within the mobile phone app), giving us the ability to verify
about six certificates per second with the existing
infrastructure.
This observation shows us that the operations of Issuing and
Verifying are twice as expensive as the simplest server ping.
Except for some common infrastructure, the architecture is
decentralized, i.e. one issuer issues (or verifier verifies) one
certificate using one smartphone at a time even if we have
hundreds of thousands of parallel requests. Even some
commonly held infrastructure can be more distributed, such as
the Solid pods. In this experiment, we used just one Solid
cloud server for all requests, but in practice, users will have
their Solid pod hosted on multiple servers or their own mobile
phone. Therefore, if only those common and fixed
infrastructures are scaled up, or load-balancing is applied to
divert requests over multiple machines, performance time will
significantly improve, with a concomitant speedup of Issuing
and Verification not requiring architectural re-design.
IV. DISCUSSION
A. More about rollout
The architecture presented in the main paper and
Supplementary Material above is all built on standard library
modules, and therefore joining a Consortium blockchain to
help roll this out at scale is relatively straightforward, subject
to suitable testing and deployment. The key hurdles are
primarily Issuer credentials and the critical mass of the
Consortium blockchain. In the case of Issuer credentials, we
mentioned in section II.E.1 about Onboarding that we use two
factor authentication for Issuers, and an API provided by the

B. Ethical considerations
It should be clear from the previous sections that the
concepts underlying Verifiable Credentials and the
Decentralized Verification of Data with Confidentiality are
diametrically opposed to any kind of central data storage or
‘Big Brother’-style snooping and data collection, and indeed
provide excellent and agreed standards for avoiding such
snooping and data collection. To be clear, in the approach we
advocate in this paper,
Personally identifiable information is stored entirely under
the Holder’s control (on a mobile phone, on the Holder’s
cloud provider of choice, or both), and additionally for
later verification purposes in minimal (a few bytes)
encoded form (hash) on a Consortium blockchain.
Moreover, the app allows the user selectively to present
only the specific test result, with no other personal
information revealed.
How is it possible that no personal information is stored in a
database? What about the certificate itself? That’s the beauty
of Verifiable Credentials, Zero Knowledge Proofs and our
approach of Minimum and Encoded Data Storage / User’s
Choice: taken together, this combined approach offers
cryptographically signed, verifiable, un-tamperable proof that
the certificate being shown was really granted by a known
testing authority to the person in question, even without
showing the name, address, phone number or even UK NHS
number of the person holding it.
Everything in this app is decentralized. Anyone wishing to
abandon involvement in this kind of certification can just
delete the Verifiable Credentials stored on their Solid Pods.
There will be no records whatsoever, as if they had never been
on the system. Deleting data on the Solid Pods will also turn
the hashes on the blockchain into ‘orphans’ (no data pointing
to the hash), i.e. the hashes will become meaningless: it is not
possible to recover the original data from a hash.
This almost-too-good-to-be-true approach does raise a fresh
concern, raised briefly in the main paper: the same techniques
we are advocating seem to open up what we call the ‘Private
Verifiable Credentials Paradox’: your digital mobile phone
app certificate is so much more private and tamper-proof than
the old paper or database versions that it could (deliberately or
accidentally), be weaponized for discrimination against your
fellow citizens. In other words, a potential problem, according

Supplementary Materials
to critics, is not that the architecture is too weak, but that it is
too strong.
Clearly, the more powerful methods of today and tomorrow
have the potential to open up a Pandora's Box of Bad Use, if
not by the modern democracies in which we may have grown
up, then by some authority in another time or place - as the
world has witnessed all too tragically in the past. We started
this project with the noble aim of facilitating a way to get
people back to work and heading towards recovery from the
devastating impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic of
2019/2020. If COVID-19 antibodies can indeed be shown
reliably to confer immunity, and the overwhelming support for
the ‘test-test-test’ mantra of the World Health Organization
continues to hold, then people are going to get tested, in
overwhelming numbers, and certificates are going to be issued
in one form or another.
But we are not adopting a ‘give-up-and-accept-our-fate-inthe-hands-of-bad-actors’ approach. Yes, a secure digital
certificate could hypothetically be weaponized to a greater
degree than a paper one, but the actual degree could be
something of a mind-set illusion. Any certification method has
such potential, and therefore, rather than casting the
technology in terms of ‘good vs evil’ we think our approach is
best considered as something that involves a trade-off between
(a) the advantages of getting people back to work using good
privacy-preserving fraud-prevention methods and (b) the
disadvantages of discriminatory (mis)use of such methods.
Our approach to this trade-off is strongly to nudge things
towards (a), and therefore we propose the following concrete
steps to achieve this:
• App usage should be strictly opt-in/optional: a paper
certificate must always be allowed by default, just as
with, say, train or airline tickets. This helps introduce
the concept and technology in a gentle manner: people
will ultimately decide what they prefer for themselves.
• Implementations must comply with UK NHS
Information Governance (IG) guidelines [23], [24].
Compliance should in principle be straightforward,
because (a) in our approach, personally identifiable
information is stored entirely under the Holder’s
control, and additionally for later verification purposes
in minimal hash-encoded form on a Consortium
blockchain, and (b) the app allows the user selectively
to present only the specific test result, with no other
personal information revealed. Even so, the UK NHS
IG documents provide a strong guiding framework for
ensuring continuing compliance, particularly with
respect to relevant EU GDPR requirements such as
‘Right to erasure’ and ‘Right to data portability’: our
architecture by its very design avoids database storage
of personally identifiable information, but oversight of
possible misuse/abuse of this and related technologies
needs to be maintained, as the next three bullet points
suggest.
• COVID-19 Antibody Test Certificates should only be
applied to workers in healthcare and other comparable

6

key sectors, as defined by the appropriate UK
Parliamentary process (for example, the list of key
exceptions to mandatory business closure during the
current pandemic was specified by the UK Ministry of
Housing, Communities, and Local Government), with
input from an Ethics Committee mentioned next.
• An Ethics Committee, comparable in scope and
composition to the UK NHS Research Ethics
Committees, should have oversight of actual
deployment of the approach advocated herein.
• The approach should be reviewed on a 3-monthly basis.
In a timely and thoughtful analysis of the ethical
complexities surrounding COVID-19 antibody test
certificates, Persad and Emanuel [25] argue convincingly for
the label ‘immunity-based licenses’ (rather than ‘immunity
passports’) as a way to focus on the positive benefits granted
to those who have been infected with COVID-19, without
necessarily worsening the lives of those who have not been
infected.
Ethical standards are challenging to uphold, but uphold
them we must: we see a strong emphasis on ethics as the best
way to negotiate a path towards a ‘pandemic end game’ in a
manner acceptable to the widest possible audience.
V. CONCLUSIONS
Will such an app be suitable as part of a ‘pandemic exit
strategy’ for helping get people back to work in key sectors?
There are many issues to be addressed first, including the
rigorous scrutiny and approval of antibody tests, likelihood
and longevity of immunity, agreement concerning ethical
oversight, and acceptance by the public. Our approach is
intended to ensure that the procedures for creating tamperproof, verifiable, privacy-preserving certificates are ‘ready to
go’ while waiting for antibody/immunity tests to achieve the
required state of robustness and acceptance. We believe that,
just as with train e-tickets, end-users will ‘vote with their feet’
and deploy the app in large numbers once its benefits have
been demonstrated. To take a stance against what we call the
‘Pandora’s Box of Bad Use’, we proposed ethical guidelines at
the end of the Discussion, which we believe are essential for
the principled development and deployment of the prototype
described in this paper.
