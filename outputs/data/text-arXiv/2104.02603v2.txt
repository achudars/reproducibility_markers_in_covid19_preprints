Abstract
Epidemiology models with constant parameters may not capture the infection patterns in the presence
of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures during a pandemic, since infectiousness is
a function of time. In this paper, Epidemiology Informed Neural Network (EINN) algorithms are introduced to discover time-varying infection rates for the COVID-19 pandemic. Since there are asymptomatic
infectives, mostly unreported, EINN learns the probability that an infective individual is asymptomatic.
Using cumulative and daily reported cases of infectives, we simulate the impact of non-pharmaceutical
mitigation measures such as early detection of infectives, contact tracing, and social distancing on the
basic reproduction number. We demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccination, a pharmaceutical mitigation
measure, together with non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures on the daily reported infectives. The
EINN algorithms discover time-varying infection and recovery rates. The Mean Squared Error is used to
demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed EINN algorithms. Simulations are presented for Italy, South
Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 data from different countries reflects various mitigation measures [1, 2], such as social
distancing, early detection of infectives, contact tracing, and vaccination [3, 4, 5]. Time-varying infection
rates have been suggested to efficiently model the spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19. For
example, nonlinear time-dependent infection rate functions were introduced in [6, 7]. Given that it may
not be possible to know the most accurate form of a time-varying infection rate, we propose a data-driven
approach that learns time-varying infection and recovery rates.
A widely used threshold parameter for the spread or extinction of an infectious disease in an epidemiology model is the basic reproduction number [8]. It is defined as the average number of persons an infected
person can infect. When the basic reproduction number is less than one, the infectious disease vanishes.
In the SIR model [9], the basic reproduction number is computed as the ratio of the infection rate to the
recovery rate. In this paper, we adopt the basic reproduction number for the asymptomatic-SIR model
introduced in [10]. We denote the basic reproduction number as BRN when the model parameters are
constant and when one or more of the model parameters are time-varying, we also have a time-varying
reproduction rate, which is denoted as Rt . This time-varying reproduction rate, Rt , demonstrates the
spread pattern of COVID-19 throughout the duration of the pandemic.
There is an asymptomatic period for every infective individual, some papers have reported a range of
7 to 14 days [11]. There are also asymptomatic infectives that never show symptoms but are infectious
[10]. Early study of the spread of COVID-19 shows that some of the infectives are asymptomatic infectives
[12, 13] and they are mostly unreported in the publicly available data [10]. An asymptomatic-SIR model

is a modification to the traditional SIR infectious disease model [9], that includes asymptomatic infectives
and asymptomatic recovered compartments, such was introduced in [10]. We introduce modifications to
the asymptomatic-SIR model by including a vaccination compartment determined by a vaccination rate,
time-varying infection and recovery rates, and a probability term that determines the portion of the total
infectives that are asymptomatic infectives.
In March and April 2020, many countries instituted widespread lockdown [14]. A model describing
lockdown and lockdown relaxation was presented [15]. The purpose of a lockdown is to limit human
contacts and potentially lower infection rates. Unfortunately, the impact of a comprehensive lockdown on
the economy is severe and thus other measures are more desirable.
Neural networks are universal approximators of continuous functions [16, 17]. In [18, 19], a feedforward
neural network (FNN) is developed to learn approximate solutions of differential equations by constraining
the residual. This FNN is called Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN). The authors in [20] developed
a deep learning solution of a COVID-19 model using an FNN. PINN has been used successfully to solve
ordinary differential equations [21] and partial differential equations [18]. In [22], a PINN with a modified
loss function is used to learn the diffusivity in a nonlinear diffusion equation. A Biologically Informed
Neural Network (BINN) is proposed in [23] to learn the nonlinear diffusion and reaction terms in a 1-D
spatial dimensional reaction-diffusion model. BINN is an extension to PINN for the discovery of underlying
dynamics of biological systems from sparse experimental data.
The Epidemiology Informed Neural Network (EINN) algorithms presented in this paper are extensions
to PINN for epidemiology models. The loss function is extended to include time-varying rates using some
known epidemiology facts about the infectious disease. Interpolation is used to generate sufficient training
data. The proposed EINN algorithms are able to capture the dynamics of the spread of the disease and
the influence of the mitigation measure. The asymptomatic infectives population is usually unreported in
the publicly available data [24]. EINN algorithms can learn the asymptomatic infectives population by
training on symptomatic infectives data that are available in the reported public data.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce and discuss the asymptomatic-SIR model.
The definition of the basic reproduction number (BRN) and the time-varying reproduction rate Rt are also
presented. In Section 3, we describe the FNN. The architecture and loss function of EINN is presented.
In Section 4, the EINN algorithm for constant infection and recovery rates is presented and applied to
data from Italy, South Korea, and the USA. In Section 5, using the EINN algorithm introduced in Section
4, we simulate the impact of non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures including social distancing, contact
tracing, and early detection of infectives on the BRN and the spread of COVID-19. The effectiveness of
vaccination in reducing the daily reported infective cases, a pharmaceutical mitigation measure, is discussed
in Section 6. In Section 7 and 8, EINN algorithms are presented for the discovery of time-varying infection
and recovery rates subject to non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures. Finally, a summary of the results
in this paper is presented in Section 9.
2. Asymptomatic-SIR Model
The asymptomatic-SIR model introduced in [10] assumes that some of the infectives are asymptomatic
infectives. This group is infectious despite not showing symptoms of COVID-19, probably do not get
tested, and are usually unreported in the various publicly available data. In Figure 1, the interactions
between the six different compartments of the asymptomatic-SIR model are shown. The dynamics of these
interactions can be represented as a system of ordinary differential equations with time-varying parameters
in eq. (1).

The initial conditions are given by S(t0 ) = S0 , I(t0 ) = I0 , J(t0 ) = J0 , R(t0 ) = R0 , and U (t0 ) = U0 . t ≥ t0
represent time in days and t0 is the start date of the pandemic in the model. β(t), γ(t), and µ(t) are
time-varying parameters. γ(t) represents the time-varying recovery rate for the symptomatic infectives. N
represents the total population eq. (2). It is assumed that N does not change throughout the pandemic and
that infective individuals are immediately infectious. We show the interactions between the compartments
of the model in Figure 1. The time-varying recovery rate of the asymptomatic infectives is denoted by
µ(t). β(t) is the time-varying infection rate, it usually depends on the infection vector. In the COVID-19
pandemic, β(t) depends also on contacts between individuals.
The asymptomatic-SIR model, eq. (1) considers six population compartments: the Susceptible S, the
symptomatic Infectives I which correspond to the reported infectives in the publicly available data, the
asymptomatic Infectives J which correspond to the unreported infectives. The total infectives are I + J.
The rest of the compartments are the symptomatic Recovered R, the asymptomatic Recovered U , and the
vaccinated compartment κS, which is a loss from the susceptible group. κ is the average percentage of
individuals that are vaccinated daily. ξ(I + J) corresponds to the portion of the total infectives that are
symptomatic and reported. That is, ξ represents the probability that an infective individual is reported.
On the other hand, (1 − ξ)(I + J) represents the asymptomatic infectives. And so, (1 − ξ) is the probability
that an infective is an asymptomatic infective.

3.1. Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
We write an FNN as a function of L layers, t input and an output N
N (t; θ) = σ(WL σ(. . . σ(W2 σ(W1 t + b1 ) + b2 ) . . .) + bL ),

(5)

where θ := (W1 , . . . , WL , b1 , . . . , bL ). Wk , k = 1, . . . , L is the set of the neural network weight matrices
while bk , k = 1, . . . , L is the set of the bias vectors. σ is the activation function. Given a collection of
sample pairs (tj , uj ) j = 1, . . . M , where u is some target function. The goal is to find θ∗ by solving the

The function M
j=1 ||N (tj ; θ) − uj ||2 on the right hand side of (6) is called the mean squared error
(MSE) loss function. A major task in training a network is to determine the suitable number of layers and
the number of neurons per layer needed, the choice of activation function, and an appropriate optimizer
for the loss function [25].
3.2. Epidemiology Informed Neural Network (EINN)
EINN is an FNN that includes the known epidemiology dynamics in its loss function. EINN MSE
loss function is a modification of the PINN MSE loss function in order to learn time-varying model
parameters. In this paper, EINN is adapted for the asymptomatic-SIR model eq. (1), where the EINN
MSE loss function includes the known epidemiology dynamics such as a lockdown. We observe that
training data is not available for all the compartments in the asymptomatic-SIR model, however, EINN is
able to capture the epidemiology interactions between the compartments because the epidemiology model

In Figure 2, EINN includes the time-varying infection and recovery rates as an output of the neural
network. ICs represents the loss at t = 0 in the neural network output for the asymptomatic infectives
J(0; θ) and the actual asymptomatic infectives J(0) determined according to the formula J(0) = (1 −
ξ)I(0)/ξ. And the loss at t = 0 in the neural network output for the asymptomatic recovered U (0; θ) and
the actual asymptomatic recovered U (0) determined according to the formula U (0) = (1 − ξ)R(0)/ξ. KP s
represent the known dynamics in the infection rates pattern. M is the number of training points. M does
not necessarily correspond to the number of available data. M is generated by fitting the data with an
˜ j ), j = 1, . . . , M is the training data for the infectives after fitting
interpolation function. For instance I(t
with an interpolation function. Mβ and Mγ are the number of training points used to enforce the known
dynamics of the infection rates pattern. On the other hand, Mκ is the number of vaccination days in the
model, Mκ is the number of days κ is not zero. V (tj ), j = 1, . . . , Mκ is the daily vaccination data for days
κ is not zero. The input to EINN is tj , j = 1, . . . , M . The epidemiology model is embedded in the residual
eq. (8). EINN solutions are not unique. In order to achieve good accuracy, we tune the hyperparameters;
such as the number of layers, number of training points, and the learning rate. In all the simulations
presented in this paper, we used 4 hidden layers, 64 neurons per layer, and the training loss was minimized
in 40000 iterations. An interpolation function is used to generate 3000 training points from the original
data-set. The loss function is minimized by a gradient-based optimizer such as the L − BF GS − B [26].

4. EINN algorithm for constant infection rates
In this section, we present the EINN algorithm 1 for the asymptomatic-SIR model with constant
parameters. That is, in eq. (1), we set [β(t), γ(t), µ(t)] to [β, γ, µ]. The learned cumulative infectives and
the recovered solution is matched against the training data. In this algorithm, the parameters represent
average rates. We implement algorithm 1 using publicly available COVID-19 data [24].
Using data from Italy, South Korea, and the United States starting from the date of the first reported
cases in the respective countries to the day before vaccination data was reported. The cumulative infective
and recovered population data are observed to be non-exponential whenever a mitigation measure such
as a comprehensive lockdown is detected in the data. We take the total population N to be 60.36 × 106 ,
51.64 × 106 , and 328.2 × 106 in Italy, South Korea and USA respectively. In Figure 3a, Figure 4a, and
Figure 5a, Mκ is zero and so κ = 0 for all the period from the first reported cases to the day before
vaccination data is reported. In addition to learning the parameters, EINN learns ξ, the probability that
an infective is reported. Large ξ indicates high reported infectives.
As shown in Figures 3a, 4a, and 5a early in the pandemic, the cumulative infective and recovered
data closely resemble an exponential function. In Figure 3, EINN algorithm 1 learns the constant model
parameters as follows: β = 0.03, γ = 0.0121, µ = 0.0128, ξ = 0.37, BRN = 2.3922. The mean squared error
(MSE) is 8.11 × 10−4 . In Figure 4, EINN algorithm 1 learns the constant model parameters β = 0.0104,
γ = 0.0053, µ = 0.0046, ξ = 0.22, and BRN = 2.1876. The mean squared error (MSE) is 1.3 × 10−5 . In
Figures 5, EINN algorithm 1 learns the constant model parameters β = 0.0202, γ = 0.0044, µ = 0.0089
and ξ = 0.46, BRN = 2.9575. The mean squared error (MSE) = 1.99 × 10−4 . The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate 1 − ξ to be 0.40 in the USA [13]. A high population proportion
of asymptomatic infectives was estimated in [12] for China and Singapore.
The COVID-19 infectives population surge witnessed in March and April 2020 around the world forced
many countries to institute strict lockdown measures. This is largely successful in reducing the BRN in
many countries, unfortunately, it also resulted in economic hardship, such that we seek other measures
that also reduces the BRN to a number less than 1. In recent months, the measures that are promoted in
most countries include contact tracing, social distancing, and facial covering. The epidemiological meaning
of each of the model parameters in eq. (1) including ξ are presented in Sections 5.1, 5.3, and 5.2.

5. Non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures
The model parameters in an epidemiology model are influenced by mitigation measures. For instance,
social distancing correspond to reducing the infection rate by reducing human contact. In this Section, we
simulate different levels of various non-pharmaceutical mitigation measure and we demonstrate its impact
on BRN and the spread of COVID-19.
5.1. Early detection of infectives
Early detection of infectives population leads to higher reported infectives. This results in an early
isolation of individuals who have had contact with infective individuals. There are no reported data for
the asymptomatic infectives populations. Simulating with higher ξ increases the symptomatic infectives
population. This corresponds to higher reported cases. Simulation is presented for Italy, South Korea,
and the U.S.A see tables 1 and 2.

symptomatic infective and symptomatic recovered data from 01/22/2020 to 09/05/2020.

Higher ξ values in tables 1 and 2, increases the symptomatic infectives population and reduces the
asymptomatic population in general. This is reflected in increase in the βξ column and decrease in the
β(1 − ξ) column. It is assumed that the total infective population is unchanged as we raise ξ. This means
that more people will be in hospitalization/isolation. This translates to more recovery in the symptomatic
compartment. BRN decreases in general.
If the asymptomatic infectives population is much higher than the symptomatic population, this results
in higher BRN. There is a right balance between I and J population. We also see that the detection of
early infectives alone is not enough to mitigate an infectious disease like COVID-19. It should be combined
with other measures such as contact tracing of infectives.
5.2. Social distancing
It is widely understood that measures such as a lockdown, social distancing, and widespread adoption
of facial covering result in the mitigation of COVID-19. Social distancing is often the most sought after
measure at reducing the BRN. The goal of social distancing is to reduce the average number of human
contacts. This is demonstrated by reducing β, the infection rate. The impact of social distancing on the
BRN is presented in the following tables 3 and 4 .

Reducing β in tables 3 and 4 correspond to a reduced symptomatic infectives population I. However, the
total infectives are unchanged as we reduce β. There is an increase in asymptomatic infectives population
J. BRN does not decrease in general. Social distancing is effective when the asymptomatic infective
population J diminishes. βξ and β(1 − ξ) both decreases. Social distancing should be combined with
contact tracing and early detection of infectives population.
5.3. Contact tracing of infectives
Contact tracing is equivalent to increasing the symptomatic recovery and asymptomatic recovery rates.
However, since we do not have reported data for the asymptomatic population, in this paper, we pursue
contact tracing as an increase in the symptomatic recovery rate. This is equivalent to reducing the
number of days an infective individual stays infective. In tables 5, 6 and 7, the impact of contact tracing
is demonstrated by increasing the symptomatic recovery rate.

The raising of γ in tables 5 to 7, increases the symptomatic infectives population I which is demonstrated in increased ξ and increased β. β(1 − ξ) decreases somewhat while βξ increases. This also results
in a reduced BRN. Contact tracing is an efficient mitigation measure in lowering the spread of COVID-19.

6. Pharmaceutical mitigation measure
The mitigation measures described in Section 5 are non-pharmaceutical measures. In this Section, we
discuss vaccination. In the fight against COVID-19, countries such as USA and United Kingdom began
to vaccinate in December, 2020. A major goal of vaccination is to reduce the susceptible population,
that is people recover without getting infected. This constitute a pharmaceutical mitigation measure.
We considered the vaccination data for the USA and United Kingdom, and simulate the effectiveness of
vaccination on the daily reported infectives. Algorithm 1 is implemented for the asymptomatic-SIR model
given as follows.
In Figure 6a, using USA data, the mitigation effect of vaccination on the daily infectives is demonstrated. Implementing algorithm 1, we obtained κ = 0.00184, which is slightly different from the projection
of κ = 0.00305, corresponding to 1 million people vaccination per day. In Figure 6b, using United Kingdom
data, we simulate the impact of vaccination on the daily reported infectives, using a smoothed daily vaccination data from 12/13/2020 to 02/05/2020 and smoothed daily reported infectives data. We implement
algorithm 1 and we obtained κ = 0.00305. Our model predicts that the daily infectives will be close to zero
by April 2021. We demonstrate the impact of increased social distancing together with the vaccination
effort. Social distancing corresponds to decreasing the infection rate β. Increased social distancing reduces
the daily reported infectives but it extends the number of days daily infectives data is significant.
7. EINN algorithms for time-dependent infection rates
The model parameters in the previous section should be interpreted as average values throughout
the pandemic. We cannot assume that these parameters stay constant because of the many government
interventions and public perceptions and responses. In this section, we compare a delayed-mitigation timeseries infection rate approach, a delayed-mitigation exponential time-dependent infection rate approach
[5, 11, 3] and a piecewise time-dependent infection rate approach. In the case of the delayed-mitigation
approach, Italy and the USA instituted the first COVID-19 lockdown on March 9th and March 18th
respectively. That is 38 days after the first case in Italy and 57 days in the USA. In 7.1 and 7.2, we
simulated the time-varying infection rate assuming there was no mitigation measure influencing the data
pre-lockdown. We run simulations for Italy, South Korea, and the United States from the date of the first
reported cases in the respective countries to the day before vaccination data was reported, κ = 0.
Remark 1. The time-dependent infection rate is non-constant in the presence of mitigation measures in
the cumulative infective data.
7.1. Delayed-mitigation time-series infection rate
Here, the infection rate β(t) in eq. (1) is nonlinear and time-dependent. The early COVID-19 lockdown
that was instituted by several countries was widespread in reach and effective in mitigating the spread of
the disease. The impact of lockdown was also immediately reflected in the cumulative infective data. As a
result, we consider the infection rate to be constant pre-lockdown and a nonlinear time-series during and
post-lockdown. Accordingly we write β(t)
(
β0
0≤t<K
β(t) =
(10)
β0 q(t) K < t,
In eq. (10), q(t) ∈ (0, 1) during and post-lockdown for each value of t [27]. β0 correspond to the
constant infection rate obtained from early data using nonlinear regression. It is the infection rate before
any mitigation is enforced. q(t) represents the presence of some mitigation in the data. When q(t) = 1,
this corresponds to an absence of mitigation. Using the reported cumulative data, the EINN algorithm 2
discovers the mitigation in the cumulative symptomatic infectives and recovered data and its impact on
the infection rate. It is assumed that there is no mitigation very early in the data, and so the infection
and recovery rates are constants during the early days of the pandemic.
In the EINN algorithm 2, Mβ correspond to the number of days number of days mitigation is delayed in
the data, which is equal to K in eq (10).

(a) The effectiveness of vaccination is demonstrated by learning the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination epidemiology parameters
using smooth daily reported infectives data from the USA. The model is extrapolated for 3 cases. The red curve is the case of no
vaccination, here κ = 0. For the blue curve, we used the USA projection of 1000000 daily vaccination. In the case of the magenta
curve, we learned κ using the daily vaccination data. The first reported case was 01/22/2020, Vaccination data were first reported
12/19/2020. Our model suggests that daily reported infectives will be asymptotically zero by May - June, 2021 if the current
vaccination rate is sustained together with the non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures.

measures.

MSE is 9.4 × 10−5 . Post lockdown, other mitigation measures including social distancing, widespread masking kept the infection
rate down. This is followed by a relaxation period that results in COVID-19 surge that was reported during the holiday.

days. The time-varying basic reproduction rate Rt is obtained using the estimate eq. (4). The EINN algorithm 2 learns γ = 0.0014
and µ = 0.0261. The MSE is 3.35 × 10−4 . This approach underestimate Rt during the pre-lockdown period.

Delayed-mitigation time-series rates

In [11, 3], it was shown that during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic when the cumulative
infection population grew exponentially, the infection rate was constant. This is demonstrated in Figures
7a and 7b. This coincide with the period before any mitigation measure. Incorporating measures such
as social distancing, lock-down and widespread adoption of facial covering in an epidemiology model is
complex. In [15] used a sigmoid function to model a time dependent decrease in the transmission of
COVID-19. In [11], an exponentially decreasing function eq. (13) was used to represent the infection rate
β(t) in eq. (1) to mimic the impact of lockdown. In Section 7.2, we learn an exponentially decreasing
infection rate assuming that it takes the form of eq. (13). We demonstrate that this approach detects
various other mitigation measures post-lockdown.
7.2. Delayed-mitigation exponential time-dependent infection rate
The infection rate β(t) in eq. (1) is defined as
(
β0
0≤t≤K
β(t) =
β0 exp (−η(t − K)) K < t.

(13)

Where K signifies the onset of government intervention including isolation, quarantine and lock-down. η
is the rate at which human contact decreases. We use EINN algorithm 3 to learn β(t) assuming that it
takes the form of eq. (13) in eq. (1). This approach also learns η. We denote K to be the number of days
between the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 and the date lockdown was instituted.
In the EINN algorithm 3, Mβ corresponds to the number of days mitigation is delayed in the data, which
is equal to K in eq (13). Mκ is the number of vaccination days.
In Section 7.2, the delayed-mitigation exponential time-dependent infection rate detects the impact of
the year 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, as well as the other mitigation measures post-lockdown using the
parameter η. It is however difficult to know if η captures all the pattern in the time-dependent infection
rate as demonstrated in Figures 8a and 8b, that is if eq. (13) helps us to learn the most accurate form of
β. For instance, the time-varying basic reproduction rate Rt is underestimated pre-lockdown in the USA
data and overestimated pre-lockdown in Italy data. Rt is overestimated post-lockdown. One limitation
in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 is that the delayed-mitigation approach is not very useful when there is no
big impacting mitigation measure such as lockdown. For example, In South Korea, mitigation measures
such as social distancing, contact tracing, and quarantine were used to effectively combat the spread of
COVID-19 early on without needing to lockdown entire cities [28].
7.3. Piecewise time-dependent infection rate
A piecewise time-dependent infection rate (16) is used to learn a time-dependent infection rate β in
eq. (1). The piecewise-constant β(t) is defined as follows,


β0
t ≤ M1




β0 q 1 M 1 < t ≤ M 2




 β0 q 2 M 2 < t ≤ M 3
β(t) =
(16)
β0 q 3 M 3 < t ≤ M 4




..


.




β0 qn Mn < t.
The goal of the parameters q1 , . . . , qn in eq. (16) is to capture the decrease/increase that occur in the
infection rate β(t). We choose M1 , . . . , Mn and we use EINN algorithm 4 to learn q1 , . . . , qn .
The learned piecewise time-dependent infection rate obtained in Section 7.3 captures the mitigation
measures that occur early in the COVID-19 data. It is non-smooth as shown in Figures 9a, 9b, and 9c
because we used a discrete piecewise function in the training. However, the COVID-19 surge that was
reported in most publicly available data in tail end of 2020 are not detected in the time-varying basic
reproduction number Rt . We see that it is difficult to know the most accurate form of a time-dependent
infection rate that captures all the pre-lockdown mitigation measures as well as the post-lockdown ones.
We seek a time-varying infection rate that also captures the COVID-19 surge that is reflected in the
cumulative infective population data after low Rt for most of summer 2020.

8. EINN algorithm for time-series infection and recovery rates
At this point, we are convinced that the infection rate β(t) is nonlinear time-varying. It is non-constant
in the presence of mitigation measures in the cumulative data, and it closely resembles an exponentially
decreasing function immediately after a wide reaching mitigation measure such as lockdown. The impact
of various combination of mitigation measures post-lockdown including social distancing, contact tracing,
early detection of infectives and strict adoption of facial covering are detected in the cumulative infective
and recovered data. We show in this section, that we can learn the infection rate β(t) from data without
any prior knowledge on how the aforementioned mitigation measures influence the interactions between
the compartments of an epidemiological model such as in the asymptomatic-SIR. This approach learns the
infection rate β(t) in eq. (1) as a nonlinear time-series without knowing an explicit form for the infection
rate. This is called equation learning [23].
We showed earlier in section (4) that increasing γ, and µ correspond to promoting measures such as
contact tracing. In this section, it is shown that the symptomatic recovery rate γ(t) and the asymptomatic
recovery rate µ(t) are also nonlinear time-varying. Observe that in Section 7.1, we used the early infection
rate β̃ in the loss function eq. (7), this is an example of using data and some properties of the epidemiology
model in the loss function. In Section 7.2, we used an explicit formula for β(t) given by equation (13) in
the loss function eq. (7), this corresponds to using data and some known dynamics of the epidemiology
model in the loss function and similarly, Section 7.3 is also an example of using data and some known
dynamics of the epidemiology model in the loss function eq. (7). In all of these approaches, we learn
nonlinear time-dependent infection rates. In this Section, we learn the infection and recovery rates as
nonlinear time-series without knowing their explicit form. We already established that the infection and
recovery rates are non-constant in the presence of mitigation measures. Using early data and nonlinear
regression, β̃ and γ̃ are obtained. This approach involves using a feed forward neural network to learn
the time-series S(t), I(t), J(t), R(t), and U (t), which are the solutions to the Asymptomatic-SIR model,
and using a feed forward neural network to learn the time-series β(t), γ(t), and µ(t). We run simulations
for Italy, South Korea, and the United States from the date of the first reported cases in the respective
countries to the day before vaccination data was reported, κ = 0. See Figures 10a, 10b, 11a, 11b, 12a, and
12b.

9. Conclusion
We have presented data-driven deep learning algorithms that discovers infection and recovery rate
patterns in an epidemiology model using cumulative symptomatic infective and recovered data. These
algorithms predict asymptomatic infectives and asymptomatic recovered populations. The asymptomatic
population is usually unreported in the publicly available data. We learn this population group from
symptomatic population data. It is demonstrated that time-dependent functions model the nonlinear
infection rates, however, it is difficult to know the most accurate form of these time-dependent functions.
The EINN algorithms presented, learns the nonlinear time-varying infection and recovery rates without
a pre-assumed pattern. This approach is useful when the dynamics of an epidemiological model such
as an asymptomatic-SIR model is impacted by various mitigation measures. These algorithms can be
adapted to most epidemiology models. Non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures such as early detection
of symptomatic infectives population, contact tracing, and social distancing are promoted by showing
their impact on the spread of COVID-19. The pharmaceutical mitigation measure such as the effect of
vaccination in reducing the daily reported infectives is demonstrated. This study is useful in the event
of a pandemic such as COVID-19, where governmental interventions and public response and perceptions
interfere in the interaction of the compartments in an epidemiology model. In future work, we will study
Spatio-temporal differential equation models with nonlocal diffusion term that arise naturally in migratory
patterns of infectives and non-infectives during a pandemic such as COVID-19.
