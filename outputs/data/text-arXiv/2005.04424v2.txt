Lower daily arrival of migrant workers preferred for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
Need a balanced number of days to repatriate all migrant workers from all states
Daily arrival rate of migrant workers does not affect Rajasthan after May 31, 2020
Repatriating migrant workers have a minimum implication on Maharashtra and Rajasthan
Highest number of trains are needed to repatriate migrant workers to Bihar

Abstract
Nationwide lockdown for COVID-19 created an urgent demand for public transportation
among migrant workers stranded at different parts of India to return to their native places.
Arranging transportation could spike the number of COVID-19 infected cases. Hence, this
paper investigates the potential surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 infection
and assesses the train and bus fleet size required for the repatriating migrant workers. The
expected to repatriate migrant worker population was obtained by forecasting the 2011 census
data and comparing it with the information reported in the news media. A modified susceptibleexposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model was proposed to estimate the surge in confirmed and
active cases of COVID-19 patients in India's selected states with high outflux of migrants. The
developed model considered combinations of different levels of the daily arrival rate of migrant
workers, total migrant workers in need of transportation, and the origin of the trip dependent
symptomatic cases on arrival. Reducing the daily arrival rate of migrant workers for states with
very high outflux of migrants (i.e., Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) can help to lower the surge in
confirmed and active cases. Nevertheless, it could create a disparity in the number of days
needed to transport all repatriating migrant workers to the home states. Hence, travel
arrangements for about 100,000 migrant workers per day to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, about
50,000 per day to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, 20,000 per day to Maharashtra and less than
20,000 per day to other states of India was recommended.

Implication of Repatriating Migrant Workers on COVID-19 Spread and Transportation Requirements

1. Introduction
The worldwide spread of novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is recognized as a pandemic by the
World Health Organization (WHO). In India, till April 29, 2020, total 33,065 confirmed, 8,429
recoveries and 1,079 deaths were reported (MoHFW, 2020). Like other countries, the
Government of India adopted social distancing as a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention
and control intervention. As part of this strategy, the large-scale population movements were
avoided or restricted since March 24, 2020. For this, a nationwide lockdown with a complete
restriction on passenger travel by all transportation modes was implemented. In the absence of
a vaccine, social distancing is argued as an effective prevention and control strategy (Singh and
Adhikari, 2020; Chatterjee et al., 2020). However, lockdown, along with a complete restriction
on passenger travel, has an immediate adverse effect on migrant workers, particularly for those
who belong to the marginalized sections of the society and depend on daily wages for living.
Approximately 10.55 million migrant workers were reported to be living in 22,567 shelters set
up in various regions of India (Rawal et al., 2020). An incidence of mass gathering on April
14, 2020 (the last day of the first phase of lockdown) near railway stations at Mumbai,
Maharashtra, and Surat, Gujarat signified the strong desire of the migrant workers to return to
their native places (Joshi et al., 2020).
The spread of COVID-19 is associated with the infected patient’s travel history (Kraemer et
al., 2020; Chinazzi et al., 2020; Singhal, 2020). So, repatriating migrant workers could increase
the risk of spreading COVID-19 not only among co-passengers but also within the communities
in their native places. Since the first week of May 2020, the Government of India and various
State Governments arranged special trains and buses for the stranded migrant workers
(Banerjea, 2020; PTI, 2020b; PTI, 2020c). Multiple studies described the impact of lockdown
on COVID-19 transmission in India (Singh and Adhikari, 2020; Chatterjee et al., 2020;
Mukhopadhyay and Chakraborty, 2020). However, the consequence of repatriating migrant
workers on the COVID-19 spread in their home state, and the transportation needs were not
explored so far. Furthermore, there is no specific transportation model to assess the demand
during pandemic from a contagious disease like COVID-19, particularly when meeting the
demand have consequence in terms of COVID-19 infection spread. So, this paper attempts to
estimate the possible implication in terms of the surge in the confirmed and active cases of
COVID-19 infection in Indian states with a high influx of repatriating migrant workers. The
estimation considered scenarios with different levels of the daily arrival rate of migrant
workers, total migrant workers in need of transportation, and origin of trip dependent
symptomatic migrant workers. A modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR)
model was proposed to predict the temporal variation of confirmed and active cases in the
selective Indian states. The study also assessed the train and bus fleet size for different daily
arrival rates of migrant workers until May 31, 2020. The concerned agencies can use the results
to schedule and arrange resources for efficient transportation of repatriating migrant workers.
2. SEIR Models
Mathematical modeling based on the differential dynamic formulations, such as susceptibleinfected-removed (SIR) and SEIR models, provides comprehensive information on the
transmission mechanism of the COVID-19 epidemic. There are different variants of
deterministic SIR and SEIR models to study the outbreak of the epidemic diseases (Tang et al.,
2020a; Quilty et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020b; Nadim et al., 2019; Read et
al., 2020). For example, a generalized SEIR model developed by Tang et al. (2020a and 2020b)
and Chen et al. (2020) successfully evaluated the transmission risk and predicted the number
of COVID-19 infected persons in China for different scenarios. Tang et al. (2020b) further
extended the SEIR model to incorporate time-dependent contact and diagnosis rates.

At any point of time !, a base SEIR model, as shown in Figure 1, divides the population of a
state or region (") into seven different compartments, i.e., susceptible (#), exposed ($),
infected (%), quarantined (&), recovered ('), deceased (() and insusceptible or isolated ()).
The flow of population through these compartments was modeled using a set of differential
equations given in Table 1. In this model, time-dependent functions were considered to
represent the reduction in COVID-19 related death, increment in recovery, and faster
identification of COVID-19 positive patients over time due to improvements and inventions in
medical science. However, like any other SEIR model, it did not consider the births and natural
deaths. So, this base SEIR model is useful to study the outbreak of the epidemic diseases in a
specific region or state until the arrival of repatriating migrant workers from different regions
or states. The base SEIR model was modified by adding time-dependent interacting
compartments for the repatriating migrant workers. These compartments interacted with the
base SEIR model compartments only for a specific time within the analysis period. The
working principle of the base SEIR and modified SEIR models are described in the following
sub-sections.

2.1 Base SEIR model
At each time step of the base SEIR model (see Figure 1), the ) compartment population, when
defying isolation for various reasons, became susceptible at the rate of D and moved to the #
compartment. Those in the # compartment, got exposed (when in contact with an infected
individual) at the rate of / and eventually got infected with COVID-19 at the rate of 2.
Accordingly, they were removed from the # compartment and added to the $ compartment,
and subsequently to the % compartment. The removal rate of 2 from the $ compartment was
equivalent to 1/incubation period or the latent time. Depending on the symptom and test
protocol, certain people of the overall population were tested. If the tested person belonged to
the % compartment, the test result was expected to be positive. These individuals were either
hospitalized or isolated in an institutional quarantine center, which was represented by the &
compartment. Individuals from the & compartment either got cured or recovered and moved to
the ' compartment at 5(!) rate or died and moved to the ( compartment at the mortality rate
of 6(!). Since all the infected individuals could not be identified without testing the entire
population, some, particularly the asymptomatic individuals, would keep spreading the virus.
The population in each compartment of a base SEIR model at time !, i.e., #(!), $(!), %(!),
&(!), '(!), ((!) and )(!), and the parameters, i.e., D, /, 2, 4(!), 5(!) and 6(!), were derived
by solving the ordinary differential equations shown in Equation 1 for the historical data of
confirmed, active, quarantined, etc. cases. So, the proficiency of an SEIR model greatly
depends on the historical data. Open-access MatLab code developed by Cheynet (2020) was
suitably modified to solve Equation 1 using the standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. In
this model, the total population was considered as "E + FGE , where "E represents the total
population of a region or state and FGE the expected repatriating migrant population. The "E
was distributed among the #, $, %, &, ', ( and ) compartments, and the FGE remained as a
non-interacting population in the base SEIR model.

2.2 Modified SEIR model for repatriating migrant worker
On arrival, migrant workers were not tested for COVID-19 infection, but only symptoms were
monitored. Similarly, at the time of boarding a train or bus, only symptoms were monitored.
Hence, asymptomatic and exposed individuals could still board a train or bus, infect copassengers, and become symptomatic before alighting. The probability of a migrant worker
being symptomatic on arrival at home state depended on their last residence or state before the
trip. If the probability of being symptomatic and quarantined, estimated by considering the
ratio of quarantined population and the total population, of a particular state R is &'S , the
expected number of migrant workers detected symptomatic on arrival among the migrant
worker population of FGST traveling from state R to state U was &'S × FGST . In a confined
compartment of a train or bus, an infected individual can expose other co-passengers. Hence,
a high value of &'S was considered to estimate the infected number of migrant workers
reaching state U from state R. Based on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) report,
the number of asymptomatic cases varied between 50 to 82%, with an average of 69%
(Chauhan, 2020). Other studies also reported the ratio of the asymptomatic and symptomatic
Page 4 of 22

Implication of Repatriating Migrant Workers on COVID-19 Spread and Transportation Requirements

population as two-third or higher (Nishiura et al., 2020; Mizumoto et al., 2020). So, the
expected number of asymptomatic migrant workers arriving at home state was assumed to be
about two-thirds of the number of symptomatic migrant workers. The symptomatic migrant
workers would be quarantined (in hospital or quarantine center) at their home state. The copassengers from the same compartment of symptomatic passengers might be quarantined as
well. All other migrant workers were expected to be in isolation for 14 days. The assumed
situations of migrant workers at their origin and destination states are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Situation of migrant workers at origin and destination
An interaction was established between a base SEIR and the FGE when the migrant workers
started arriving. It helped to assign the repatriating migrant workers to the appropriate
compartments. For example, the symptomatic migrant workers were assigned to the &
compartment, asymptomatic to the % compartment, and remaining to the ) compartment. The
modified SEIR model with possible interactions for the arriving migrant workers is shown in
Figure 3. Note that the migrant worker population did not interact with any compartments of
the base SEIR model until the first arrival day, and hence, no such interaction is shown in
Figure 1. Total time required to transport all migrant workers to their respective home states
would depend on the travel arrangements. Hence, this study adopted different levels of daily
arrival rates of repatriating migrant workers for analyses.

3. Data Preparation and Analyses
In India, census data is collected every ten years. The last census data was collected in 2011,
and the next census data would be collected in 2021. Hence, the 2011 census data published
by the Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India (MoHA, 2020) was
analyzed to identify states with the significantly high influx and outflux of the inter-state
migrant population (includes migration for work, business, marriage, education, and other
purposes). As observed in Figure 4, Maharashtra, National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi,
Gujarat, Haryana and Karnataka had a higher influx of migrants (i.e., the states where people
migrated to), and Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh had a
higher outflux of migrants (i.e., the states from where people migrated). Cumulatively these
states contributed more than 50% of the influx and outflux of inter-state migrant population of

India. So, in this study, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh
were analyzed for the repatriating migrant workers from Maharashtra, NCT of Delhi, Gujarat,
Haryana, Karnataka, and other states and union territories (UT) of India. It is to be noted that
Maharashtra had the highest influx of migrants and the fourth-highest outflux of migrants. As
of May 15, 2020, Maharashtra, Gujarat, NCT of Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar
Pradesh were among the top ten COVID-19 affected states and UTs of India.
Further, the 1981 to 2011 census data were used to obtain the "E and FGE for the analysis
year 2020. There are different methods such as arithmetic increase, geometric increase,
incremental increase, decrease in growth rate and logistic curve, to forecast population based
on the land-use and economic status of a region (Jensen, 1995; Moalafhi et al., 2012; Lal, 2020;
Jain et al., 2015). While predicting the 2011 population from the previous census data, the
accuracy of the incremental increase method was found to be better than the other methods.
Hence, Equation 2, representing the forecasted population by incremental increase method,
was used to obtain the analysis year population. See Table 2 for the obtained population of the
states considered.

The input parameters for the modified SEIR model were D, /, 2, 4(!), 5(!), 6(!), daily arrival
rate of migrant workers, total number of repatriating migrant workers and their infection
probability. The D, /, 2, 4(!), 5(!) and 6(!) for the modified SEIR model were obtained from
the base SEIR model. However, at the time of the analysis, reliable statistics on the total number
of repatriating migrant workers, their daily arrival rate, and infection probability were not
available. In such a situation, exploratory modeling and analysis (EMA) could use
computational experiments to analyze uncertain and complex conditions (Kwakkel and Pruyt,
2012). This approach develops carefully selected scenarios by appropriate assumptions/guesses
to exploit the relevant information. A similar process was adopted in this study to utilize the
available information related to the migrant population and infection probability and simulate
various scenarios using the modified SEIR model.

3.1 Expected repatriating migrant workers
Migrant workers residing for less than four years could be socially and economically
vulnerable. Therefore, the number of migrant workers expected to repatriate was derived from
Equation 3 based on the number of migrants arriving in the last four years of the census year.
The forecasted total influx and outflux of migrants in the previous four years of analysis year
are presented in Table 3, and the overall process of forecasting is shown in Figure 5. About 814% of the forecasted outflux migrants of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and
Rajasthan, and about 4-7% of the forecasted outflux migrants of Maharashtra was assumed to
repatriate. Among all the Indian states and UTs, Maharashtra had the highest number of
confirmed patients and death due to COVID-19. The migrant workers may refrain from
returning to Maharashtra (home state). Hence, a lower repatriation range was adopted for
Maharashtra. As shown in Table 4, the number of migrant workers in scenarios 1, 2, and 3 were
arbitrarily chosen from the lower, middle, and upper terciles (3-quantiles) of the range of
repatriating migrant workers, respectively. Information from various published sources, as
presented in Table 3, confirmed the repatriating migrant workers as 1.9-21% (with an average
of about 10.2%) of the influx or outflux migrants recorded in the last four years.

3.2 Arrival rate of repatriating migrant workers
The expected repatriating migrant workers would arrive in phases due to limited public
transportation facilities. Trains for ferrying migrant workers had a capacity of 1200 to 1700
passengers (Dhingra, 2020; Saxena, 2020), and buses were expected to transport at 50%
capacity (Express News Service, 2020; Malik, 2020). Total number of trains and buses
available for this purpose was about 300 and 10,000, respectively (Dhingra, 2020; Malik,
2020), which varied over time for different reasons (Dhingra, 2020; PTI, 2020b; PTI, 2020c;
Saxena, 2020; Banerjea, 2020). Hence, this study adopted different daily arrival rates of
repatriating migrant workers for analyses. The trains were highly preferred for interstate travel
as buses traveled till state borders. The trains were expected to increase in number for fast
mobilization (Dhingra, 2020). If 5-10% (15-30 trains) of the 300 trains operating throughout
India are traveling daily to Uttar Pradesh (highest outflux state), about 18,000 to 36,000
passengers can reach Uttar Pradesh per day. Therefore, this study explored the daily arrival
rates between 20,000 and 100,000 migrant workers (at an interval of 10,000 migrant workers
per day) for the three scenarios shown in Table 4.
3.3 Infection probability of repatriating migrant workers
Social distancing requirements are compromised in the public transportation mode. Hence,
COVID-19 infection increases significantly with the use of public transport (Zheng et al.,
2020). During repatriation, migrant workers would travel 12 to 72 hours in a confined space of
a train or bus, and use the common facilities such as washroom, train station, bus station, and
Page 9 of 22

Implication of Repatriating Migrant Workers on COVID-19 Spread and Transportation Requirements

catering service. Therefore, this study explored the infection probability between 10 and 100
times (at an interval of 30 times) of the average infection probability of the trip originating state
for the three scenarios shown in Table 4.
The base SEIR model was simulated once for a state to obtain the base scenario with no effect
of repatriating migrant workers. Whereas, the modified SEIR model was simulated 108 times
to represent the effect of three scenarios of the total expected repatriating migrant workers for
nine different daily repatriation rates and four possible infection probability (i.e., 3×9×4 = 108).
The daily “confirmed”, “recovered” and “death” related data available from March 14 to April
29, 2020, at https://www.covid19india.org (COVID-19 Tracker, 2020) was used in the base
SEIR model. A minimum of ten confirmed cases was considered to initiate the analysis. Hence,
for specific states like Madhya Pradesh and Bihar with the late spread of infection, the analysis
start date was after March 14, 2020. The probability of being symptomatic and quarantined
estimated based on the active and quarantined population of a state on April 29, 2020 and the
total population, and the four possible infection probabilities (i.e., Options A, B, C, and D) are
presented in Table 5. The distribution of repatriating migrant workers between origin and home
states, estimated from the migration details available in 2011 census data, is shown in Table 6.

4. Numerical simulation results and discussion
The repatriating migrant workers were assumed to arrive in the respective states from May 5,
2020. Hence, in the modified SEIR model, the time-dependent daily interaction of the
repatriating migrant worker compartment with the %, & and ) compartments (refer Section 2.2)
were initiated from May 5, 2020. It remained active until the aggregated daily arrival reached
the total expected repatriating migrant workers. Both the base and modified SEIR models were
initiated by assigning the start day data to the corresponding recovered, deceased and
quarantined compartments, and simulated until May 31, 2020. About 2000 times of the total
quarantined, recovered, and deceased cases were assigned to the # compartment, the remaining
state population without the repatriating migrant workers to the ) compartment, and the
repatriating migrant workers in the migrant worker compartment.
4.1 Parameter values
The D, /, 2, 47 , 4C , 57 , 5C , 67 and 6C values for the base scenario are shown in Table 7, and its
fitted trends for confirmed, active, recovered and deceased cases are shown in Figure 6. For all
the states except Bihar, the D value, representing the rate of being susceptible, indicates that
about 10% of the population can become susceptible. In Bihar, this rate is less (about 2%).
Similarly, for all the states except Uttar Pradesh, the / values indicated that the susceptible
people were immediately exposed to the infection. It supports the high contagious
characteristics of COVID-19 (Peng et al., 2020; Mangoni and Pistilli 2020). However, for Uttar
Pradesh, this rate is low and may need further investigation for a better understanding of the
interactions between people. The 2 value, indicating the rate of being infected after exposure,
is almost similar for all the states analyzed. In other words, the incubation time (1/2) or latent
time of COVID-19 infection is about two days. The other parameters are state-specific, and
depend on the confirmed, active, recovered and deceased cases recorded. The RMSE values
presented in the corresponding plot (see Figure 6) indicate that the fitted model had
comparatively higher errors for Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

4.2 Surge in confirmed and active cases
The expected confirmed and active cases for the 108 scenarios were adjusted for the base
scenario to estimate the surge in confirmed and active cases at each state. The range between
the first and third quartiles and the median values (i.e., the second quartile) of these increased
confirmed and active cases are presented in Figure 7. With stringent measures, the surge in
confirmed and active cases could be within the first quartile. However, in the worst situation,
the surge in confirmed and active cases could be higher than the third quartile. For a daily
arrival rate of 20,000 migrant workers, Figures 7a and 7b represent the surge in confirmed and
active cases, respectively. As expected, the confirmed cases in all the states were increasing
Page 11 of 22

during the analysis period (see Figure 7a). However, as shown in Figure 7b, the surge in active
cases for some states such as Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh were either flattening or reducing in
the last week of May 2020. In these two states, the effect of repatriating migrant workers would
be maximum around May 15, 2020 for the best-case scenario and around May 27, 2020, for
the worst-case scenario.

If the daily arrival rate of migrant workers increases to 100,000, among the states analyzed,
Uttar Pradesh will experience the most significant surge in the confirmed and active cases at
the beginning (see Figures 7c and 7d), which is expected to drop later (see Figure 7d). In the
best-case scenario, Uttar Pradesh would experience a peak around May 16, 2020, and in the
worst-case scenario, around May 23, 2020. A similar trend was observed for Rajasthan as well.
In the best-case situation, Rajasthan would experience a peak around May 15, 2020, and in the
worst-case scenario, around May 20, 2020. Irrespective of the daily arrival rate of migrant

workers, Madhya Pradesh might experience a surge in confirmed and active cases until the end
of the analysis period. The effect of migrant workers returning to Maharashtra was low
compared to all the states analyzed. If the migrant workers leaving a state were adjusted, the
surge in confirmed and active cases in Maharashtra was expected to be even lower than the
cases presented in this paper.

The mean values of the surge in active cases for daily arrival rates of 20,000, 40,000, 60,000,
80,000, and 100,000 migrant workers are presented in Figure 8. It can be observed that for a
daily arrival rate of 20,000 migrant workers, the surge in active cases in Uttar Pradesh and
Bihar was considerably less. Further, by mid-May 2020, the surge in active cases for a daily
arrival rate of 60,000 or more migrant workers was two to three times higher than the surge in
active cases for the daily arrival rate of 20,000 migrant workers. Irrespective of the daily arrival
rates, the surge in active cases in Rajasthan could be almost the same by the end of the analysis
period. In other words, for Rajasthan, the effect of daily arrival rate on the active cases
diminishes beyond May 31, 2020. However, such a trend was not observed for Uttar Pradesh,
Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra.

5. Train and bus fleet size assessment
The travel distance, travel time, travel mode speed, travel mode capacity, expected total
repatriating migrant workers indicated in Table 4, and distribution of repatriating migrant
workers given in Table 6 were considered to establish the train and bus fleet size required to
transport the repatriating migrant workers. It was assumed that 10% of the repatriating migrant
workers would choose unorganized transportation modes such as hired private vehicles and
non-motorized transport modes, and 90% would choose the organized transportation mode
arranged by the State Governments and the Central Government. Buses arranged by the State
Governments would ply up to the political boundaries of respective states. If a home and
Page 14 of 22

Implication of Repatriating Migrant Workers on COVID-19 Spread and Transportation Requirements

migrated states (or UTs) share a common border, the buses of migrated state would transport
the repatriating migrant workers until the border of the home state. From there, the buses of the
home state would transport them to their final destination. In this, the roundtrip travel time of
a bus would approximately reduce to half; but, the number of buses required would double. It
requires bilateral agreement or understanding between the migrated and home states. So,
transportation of repatriating migrant workers may not be possible between states, not sharing
a common border. In the presence of bus services, it was assumed that 45% of the repatriating
migrant workers would travel by bus and the remaining 45% by train. Otherwise, 90% of the
repatriating migrant workers would travel by train. The average speed of buses and trains were
considered as 50 kmph and 80 kmph, respectively. Also, the roundtrip journey, disinfection
time, cleaning time, average delay, time to change train engine, and refueling and driver break
time for buses were appropriately assumed. The bus and train capacities were adopted as 25 (at
50% occupancy) and 1200, respectively. The fleet size assessed based on these assumptions is
shown in Table 8, and the details regarding the estimation process in the Appendix.
Though the total number of migrant workers returning to Bihar was lower than Uttar Pradesh
(see Table 4), the number of trains required to transport them to Bihar was marginally higher
than the Uttar Pradesh. It is because Bihar is comparatively far from the highly migrated states
(such as Maharashtra, NCT of Delhi, Gujarat, and Haryana) than Uttar Pradesh (see Table A1)
and none of the highly migrated states have a common border with Bihar. Though Rajasthan
and NCT of Delhi are well connected by road via Haryana, no buses were considered to
transport migrant workers from NCT Delhi to Rajasthan. About 69% of the migrant workers
repatriating to Maharashtra were expected from the three neighboring states of Gujarat,
Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh. Hence, for Maharashtra, the estimated bus fleet size is
relatively large, even though the total repatriating migrant workers were comparatively low
(see Table 4).
Table 8 revealed that at a daily arrival rate of 20,000, more than a month is needed to ferry the
migrant workers to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. It is a considerably longer duration than the time
required to repatriate migrant workers to states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and
Maharashtra. Arranging transportation for about 100,000 migrant workers per day to Uttar
Pradesh and Bihar, about 50,000 to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, 20,000 to Maharashtra and
less than 20,000 to other states of India can bring some parity in the total number of days
required to transport the repatriating migrant workers. The decision on the daily arrival rate of
migrant workers also depends on the transportation and health infrastructure available in the
receiving states. For example, Bihar was unable to facilitate more buses for repatriating migrant
workers (FE Online, 2020). Similarly, Figure 8 indicates the increased need for health
infrastructure in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for the higher daily arrival rates. The transportation
operating agencies also need to consider infrastructure capacity and availability of the human
resources in deciding the train and bus fleet size. For example, the Indian Railways could
operate only 115 “Shramik Trains” (special trains for transporting migrant workers) from May
01 to 06, 2020, to transport more than 100,000 migrant workers within India (PTI, 2020c).

Implication of Repatriating Migrant Workers on COVID-19 Spread and Transportation Requirements

6. Conclusions
This study presents the effect of the repatriating migrant workers on the COVID-19 spread in
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra, and the train and bus fleet
required to transport the repatriating migrant workers. A modified SEIR model was proposed
to estimate the surge in confirmed and active cases of states analyzed. The analysis could reveal
the effect of the daily arrival rate of migrant workers on the surge in confirmed and active cases
in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan. The surge in confirmed and active
cases was expected to be small for lower daily arrival rates, but states may experience disparity
in the duration to complete the repatriation. So, a holistic optimization of the repatriation,
considering the possible constraints of transportation and health infrastructure, is warranted.
The migrant worker population returning to their home state had a significant impact on the
expected number of confirmed and confirmed cases. Since the number of migrant workers
returning to Maharashtra was supposedly low, the state's surge in confirmed and active cases
was predicted to be smaller than the other states analyzed. As indicated earlier, it could be even
lower if the migrant workers leaving a state was considered in the analysis. Comparison of the
surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 infection due to the interaction of
repatriating migrant workers (see Figure 8) indicated Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya
Pradesh might need close monitoring. In this study, the migrant workers arriving before May
5, 2020, were neglected. Similarly, migrant workers exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 after
arrival were assumed to be identified on the arrival day. In reality, due to the incubation period
of COVID-19, there could be a lag in the symptom exhibition.
As discussed earlier, stringent measures in screening migrant workers before boarding and
strict isolation policy after arrival might control the surge in confirmed and active cases. Some
of the State Governments planned for 14 to 21 days quarantine period for the arriving migrant
workers (Kumar, 2020b). Alternatively, restarting industries with a safe work environment
might encourage migrant workers to stay back. The Maharashtra and Karnataka State
Governments allowed a few industries, where migrant workers are generally employed, to
operate (Poovanna, 2020). Such activities would help the migrant workers to earn a livelihood,
reduce the travel demand, and sustain the economy (Sastry, 2020).
This study, instead of considering the effect of variations in the daily travel demand or infection
probability with respect to time, adopted different levels of daily travel demand and infection
probability. This approach reveals the possible extent of the effect. The surge in COVID-19
infection for any time-dependent variation of input parameters is expected to be within the
extent of the effect reported in this study. An SEIR model represents the population in different
compartments. Dividing the population into additional compartments to portray the possible
interactions between the quarantined individuals and various groups such as health care
professionals and essential service providers can yield precise information about the infection
spread, but it would require input information that is not readily available. The predicted
confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 infected persons greatly depend on both
pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and control strategies and
infection test policies. Any change in these strategies and policies over time would affect the
actual surge in confirmed and active cases. Further, the SEIR model parameters such as !, ",
#, $(&), ((&) and )(&) were calibrated for a specific time period, which may change
significantly during the period of projections. The data used in the base SEIR model to calibrate
the parameters could represent a period of high transmission, which may not sustain long.
Hence, there is a possibility that the results presented in the manuscript could be different from
the actual surge in confirmed and active COVID-19 cases.

Implication of Repatriating Migrant Workers on COVID-19 Spread and Transportation Requirements

During this study, the non-availability of certain crucial information needed to study the
influence of transportation during a biological disaster like COVID-19 was identified.
Organized efforts to acquire pertinent information could be helpful in the future. Some of the
requirements are summarized as follows:
a) During pandemic like COVID-19, the migrant workers, students, tourists, business
executives, family members, etc., who traveled out of town, would attempt to return to
their hometown. In India, basic information of migrants settled in a particular state or
UT was obtained while collecting the census data. However, this available information
was not adequate to estimate the repatriating population. Hence, it is recommended to
develop a national-level model to estimate the repatriating population during biological
disasters.
b) The number of confirmed and active cases can vary with infection testing rate, test
protocol, lockdown policy, etc. This study considered available data till April 29, 2020
for the analysis and did not consider variations of these factors beyond the analysis date.
Hence, developing an appropriate model to correlate the testing rate, test protocol, and
lockdown policy with COVID-19 spread can help in improving the infection
forecasting accuracy.
c) In the absence of realistic data, on arrival, the repatriating migrant workers were
assumed to be symptomatic with a higher probability. Interaction of passengers within
a confined train compartment and bus coach need to be studied to develop appropriate
models for repatriating population of different age group. It is crucial, particularly for
the migrant workers and students who are expected to repatriate in large numbers during
the biological disaster like COVID-19.

About 10% migrants are assumed to travel using unorganized travel modes such as hired
private vehicles and non-motorized transport modes.
Steps to estimate train and bus fleet size
Assumptions
Average speed of train = 80 kmph
Average speed of bus = 50 kmph
Average capacity of a train (789:;< ) = 1200 passengers
Average capacity of a bus (7=>? ) = 25 passengers (at 50% of the standard capacity)
Average distance between states is available in Table A1.

Implication of Repatriating Migrant Workers on COVID-19 Spread and Transportation Requirements

Additional travel time required during COVID-19 is available in Table A2.
Percentage of migrant workers choosing a specific travel mode (@7A89:;< B9 =>? ) is available
in Table A3.
Percentage of migrant workers repatriating from a migrated state to a home state (i.e.,
@CADE 8B FE ) is available in Table 6.
Trains and buses were assumed to return empty in the roundtrip.
Buses would halt for 0.5 hours (i.e., halt duration) after every 4 hours of drive (i.e., the time
between halts) to facilitate bio-break.
Buses travel till the common state borders.
Step 1: Estimate roundtrip travel time (GHH) in hours for train and bus using equation A.1.
