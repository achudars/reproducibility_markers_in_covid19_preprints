ABSTRACT
Risk and response communication of public agencies through social media played a significant
role in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) and such interactions were
echoed in other information outlets. This study collected time-sensitive online social media data
and analyzed such communication patterns from public health (WHO, CDC), emergency (FEMA),
and transportation (FDOT) agencies using data-driven methods. The scope of the work includes a
detailed understanding of how agencies communicate risk information through social media during
a pandemic and influence community response (i.e. timing of lockdown, timing of reopening) and
disease outbreak indicators (i.e. number of confirmed cases, number of deaths). The data includes
Twitter interactions from different agencies (2.15K tweets per agency on average) and
crowdsourced data (i.e. Worldometer) on COVID-19 cases and deaths were observed between
February 21, 2020 and June 06, 2020. Several machine learning techniques such as (i.e. topic
mining and sentiment ratings over time) are applied here to identify the dynamics of emergent
topics during this unprecedented time. Temporal infographics of the results captured the agencylevels variations over time in circulating information about the importance of face covering, home
quarantine, social distancing and contact tracing. In addition, agencies showed differences in their
discussions about community transmission, lack of personal protective equipment, testing and
medical supplies, use of tobacco, vaccine, mental health issues, hospitalization, hurricane season,
airports, construction work among others. Findings could support more efficient transfer of risk
and response information as communities shift to new normal as well as in future pandemics.

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION
No person or place is safe from natural or man-made hazards or losses resulting from an
extreme event. Infectious disease can significantly add to the far-reaching adverse consequences
and sufferings of countries and communities. One way to reduce such impacts can be done by
investing in communication networks similar to the resilience observed in civil infrastructure
systems (1). However, advancing such resilience capacities is not that simple since often times it
is quite challenging to identify low cost alternatives. Communicating risks, connecting community
networks (2), and promoting resilience culture can aid local communities in making progress to
increase their resilience. As such, community coalitions of elected representatives from the public
and private sectors, with ties and funding from federal and state governments, and with input from
local residents, are becoming very relevant. Such coalitions may be reinforced to determine the
exposure and vulnerability of the community to hazard, to inform and communicate risk, and to
analyze and extend the capacity of the community to manage such risks. A truly robust coalition
will have a clear leadership and governance system at the core, and people with sufficient time,
expertise, and commitment required to establish and sustain relationships among all the
community stakeholders (3).
Public agencies engagement in risk communication can lead to more effective decisionmaking and enhanced public feedback to the regulatory process. Risk and response communication
of public agencies through social media played a significant role in the emergence and spread of
novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) and such interactions were echoed in other information outlets.
The primary goal of this study is to mine and analyze time-sensitive agency-level social media
data (rich spatio-temporal data) as well as crowd-sourced data (i.e. Worldometer). The scope of
the work includes a detailed understanding of how agencies communicate risk information through
social media during a pandemic and influence community response (i.e. timing of lockdown,
timing of reopening) and disease outbreak indicators (i.e. number of confirmed cases, number of
deaths). The specific aims are twofold: (1) to document how public agencies interact and
communicate health risk information through their online social networks during a major disease
outbreak; (2) to examine how online social networks influence the current COVID-19 pandemic
situation in terms of the change in daily number of cases and deaths in United States.
To achieve the goal and aims, the study have utilized social media interactions of four
major public agencies e.g. World Health Organization (WHO), Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Florida Department of
Transportation (FDOT) with crowd-sourced information on COVID-19. The data includes Twitter
interactions from these agencies (2.15K tweets per agency on average) and crowdsourced
information about COVID-19 cases and deaths between February 21, 2020 and June 06, 2020.
Several machine learning techniques such as (i.e. topic mining and sentiment ratings over time)
are applied here to identify the dynamics of emergent topics during this unprecedented time. The
contribution to the knowledge gaps based on empirical literature are listed below:
 It has developed methods to advance our understanding of how public agencies influence
online, while communicating health risks and interacting in their respective communities as the
disease continues to spread;
 It informed the literature on how information is exchanged among people who are socially
connected online and exposed to health risk in such outbreaks of disease;
 This study used novel machine learning techniques to identify the dynamics of risk
communication strategies during this unprecedented time ;

4
 It generated temporal infographics of the results captured the agency-levels variations over
time in circulating information
LITERATURE REVIEW
The transmutability of the latest coronavirus disease in 2019 was tracked in Zhejiang,
China accounting for transmissions from imported cases. While Zhejiang is one of the worst 21
affected provinces, an interruption in the transmission of the disease (i.e. an instant reproduction
number < 1) was observed in early / mid-February following an early social-distancing response
to the outbreak (4). Zhang et al. developed data-driven, susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantinerecovered (SEIQR) models to simulate the outbreak of Coronavirus with measures of social
distancing and epicenter lockdown. Population migration data combined with officially recorded
data were used to estimate model parameters and then to measure the daily exported infected
individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and the daily susceptible population size (5).
In 2003, public health interventions were crucial in the prevention of the SARS epidemic.
Community containment requires steps ranging from increasing social distancing to city-wide
quarantine. Whether these steps (isolation, quarantine, social distancing) will be appropriate to
monitor 2019-nCoV depends on resolving some unanswered issues (6). Many countries only seek
to achieve social distancing and hygiene measures when widespread transmission is apparent. It
gives the virus a number of weeks to propagate with a higher basic reproductive number than if it
had been in place before transmission was observed or widespread. Hence, preventive, low cost,
enhanced hygiene and social distance in the sense of imminent population transmission of the
novel coronavirus COVID-19 should be considered (7).
Social media is considered as an emerging platform for efficient crisis communication in
recent literature (8; 9). Traditional media is primarily intended for one-way communication
whereas social media allows two-way communication, hence social media platforms are
exclusively different (10). Sadri et al. explained the critical role of social media during crisis by
facilitating communication and information dissemination to both evacuee and non-evacuee
during hurricane Sandy (11). Zhang et al. envisages intelligent public disaster information and
alert based on social media, which has three functions: (1) effectively and efficiently collecting
disaster situational awareness information; (2) promoting self-organized assistance activities; and
(3) enabling emergency management agencies to hear from the public. The results of this analysis
highlight the importance of such research fields; (1) a fine-grained social media catastrophe
ontology with semantic interoperability, (2) trend knowledge network pattern and emerging
prominent users, (3) fine-grained societal impact assessment due to infrastructure failures, and (4)
best practices for social media use during disasters (12).
Austin et al. examines how audiences seek social and traditional media information, and
what factors influence media usage during crises. Using the model of social-mediated crisis
communication (SMCC), a review of crisis information and sources reveals that audiences use
social media for insider information and check-in with family / friends during crises, and use
traditional media for educational purposes. Convenience, interaction, and personal feedback
encourage the use of conventional and social media; usage of both discourages overload. Humor
and beliefs towards social media uses discourage the use of social media while legitimacy
promotes the use of conventional media. The findings stressed the importance of the influence of

5
third parties in crisis communication and the need to use traditional and social media in crisis
response (13).
Freimuth et al. describes the design, implementation, and assessment of a risk
communication simulation during the first hours of a pandemic. The simulation design was
focused on the communication of crisis and emergency risks principles upheld by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as the author's collective experience. Several local
health district risk communicators in Georgia responded to a scenario where after returning from
an international conference, every community in the state had teenagers infected with avian flu.
The evaluation revealed that, under the time pressures of a realistic and stressful event, local risk
communicators had much greater difficulty following the principles of risk communication than
they did in a tabletop workout. Strengths and weaknesses of local risk communicators'
performance are identified in addition to the lessons learned on designing and implementing a
simulation for risk management (14).
Palen et al. (15) studied the rapid growth of social media in a number of disaster situations,
exploring issues such as citizen engagement, community-oriented computing, distributed problem
solving, and digital volunteerism as modes of socio-technical innovation, as well as issues of
situational knowledge and truthfulness as opportunities and challenges emerging from the social
media data deluge. The chapter also discusses the study that looks at integrating social media
technologies and data into current emergency response work. Reflecting on the decade-old area of
science, the authors warned of the danger that all "crisis" encounters can fail unintentionally
without differentiation, which appears to happen because social media networks cross-cut all
emergency situations. Through an effort to isolate what social media adds new, there is a tendency
to fail to recognize how non-technological influences on cultural socio-behavioral scales greatly
affect the usage of social media itself.
Misinformation spreading in social media are also becoming an evolving concern.
Monahan et al. mentioned that mass media play an important but often misunderstood role in the
events of a catastrophe. Research has repeatedly shown that disaster-related media reporting
appears to be riddled with disinformation and promotes misconceptions about race, social status,
aggression and crime. Studies have found that powerful media campaigns can support prevention
efforts, strengthen early warning systems, facilitate orderly and prompt evacuation procedures and
help bring communities together in times of upheaval. Authors review research on the relationship
between media and disaster to highlight the many ways media can positively impact disaster
preparation and recovery, while also highlighting the many issues associated with disaster
reporting. Future directions for media-disaster research are being discussed along with ways in
which media staff and emergency response professionals can handle the media-disaster
relationship more efficiently before, during and after emergency incidents (16).
Battur et al. detected twitter bot, which is a software that sends fake tweets automatically
to users. Detecting bots is necessary to identify the fake users and to protect the genuine users from
misinformation and malicious intents. The study proposes an approach to detect the twitter bots
using several machine learning algorithms; such as Decision Tree, Multinomial Naïve Bayes,
Random Forest and Bag of Words. The algorithm with highest accuracy (Bag of Words) is used
to test real time data (17). Asr et al. stated that misinformation detection at the level of full news
articles is a text classification problem and reliably labeled data in this domain is rare. Previous
work relied on news headlines, microblogs, tweets and articles collected from so-called

6
“reputable” and “suspicious” websites and labeled accordingly. Authors leveraged fact-checking
websites to collect individually labeled news articles with regard to the veracity of their content
(18). Huang et al. proposed a systematic meta-analysis (SMA) looked at 38 studies involving real
responses to hurricane warnings and 11 studies with expected responses to hypothetical hurricane
performed since 1991 (19).
METHODOLOGY
The focus of this study is to examine how public agencies risk assessments, risk averting
behaviors, and crisis communication patterns in online social network influence the pandemic
situation. To reveal the interaction patterns, several machine learning algorithms have used in this
study. At first, sentiment analysis over time for major public organizations have performed. Then
Dynamic Topic Models (based on Topic Model theory) was applied to identify the topics over the
same timeline which causes the change of sentiments.
Sentiment analysis is a method of Natural Language Processing (NLP) task at many levels
of granularity. Starting from a document level classification task, it has been handled at the
sentence level and more recently at the phrase level (20). It is well recognized that twitter usergenerated content with rich sentiment information should be utilized for many applications such
as search engines and other information systems. While tweet level sentiment analysis results
indeed provide very useful information, the overall or general sentiment tendency towards topics
are more appealing in some scenarios. For example, people are curious about how others feel about
Apple’s new product, “iPhone11,” and it will offer great convenience for them if major opinions
are collected from massive tweets (21).
A topic model is a statistical model to explore the abstract "topics" that happen in an
assembly of information in machine learning and natural language processing. This was first
explored by David Blei according to the most common topic model named Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA). The instinct behind LDA is that the set of texts reveal numerous topics. In topic
models, first, the algorithm chose a topic, then sample a set of words from the given topic. Clusters
of similar terms are the themes or topics created by topic modelling technology. A topic model is
a recurrently performed text-mining tool for the discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text
body. Topic models can help us to organize and provide insights into understanding large
collections of unstructured text bodies (22).
The dynamic topic model (DTM) includes a group of probabilistic time series model,
which is used to observe the time evolution of topics in huge document collections. This group of
models was proposed by David Blei and John Lafferty and is an extension to Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) that can handle chronological documents. In LDA, both the order and the words
appear in a document, whereas words are still assumed to be interchangeable, but in a dynamic
topic model, the order of the documents plays a key role. The method is to use state-space models
to represent the topics on the natural parameters of the multinomial distributions. To perform
approximate posterior inference over the latent topics, variation in approximations based on
Kalman filters and nonparametric wavelet regression are developed. In addition to providing
sequential, quantitative, and predictive models, DTM provides a qualitative window into the
contents of a large document collection.
It is assumed that the data is divided by time slice in a dynamic topic model, for example,
by month. It is modeled as each slice's documents with a K component subject model, where slice

7
t-related topics evolve from slice t-1-related topics. Let βt denote the V -vector of natural
parameters for topic k in slice t for a K-component model with V terms. A multinomial distribution
is usually represented by its mean parameterization. If we denote the mean parameter of a Vdimensional multinomial by π, the mapping βi = log (πi/πV) of the ith element of the natural
parameter is given. Dirichlet distributions are used in typical language modeling applications to
model uncertainty over word distributions. The Dirichlet, however, is not conducive to sequential
modeling. Alternatively, we chain the natural parameters of each βt subject into a state-space model
that evolves with Gaussian noise; equation (2) shows the simplest version of such a model.
𝛽𝑡 |𝛽𝑡−1 ~𝑁(𝛽𝑡−1 , 𝜎 2 𝐼)

(1)

In LDA, the document-specific topic proportions θ are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution.
In the dynamic topic model, a logistic normal is used with mean α to express uncertainty over
proportions. The sequential structure between models is again captured with a simple dynamic
model is expressed by equation (3).
𝛼𝑡 |𝛼𝑡−1 ~𝑁(𝛼𝑡−1 , 𝜎 2 𝐼)

(2)

For simplicity, it did not model the dynamics of topic correlation, as it was done for static models
by Blei and Lafferty (23). By chaining together topics and topic proportion distributions, it has
sequentially tied a collection of topic models.
DATA SOURCE AND DATA COLLECTION
Traditional datasets have limited capacity to adequately capture user risk communication
strategies and analyze user concerns with such details and coverage. As such, social media
datasets, enriched with user activity information, will be useful to capture user sentiments and
concerns in real time and help early detection of the people exposed to health-risks in the
vulnerable communities. Twitter, in particular, provides unique features to release their data
through their Application Programming Interface (API) and make it publicly available which could
then be combined with other complementary information (e.g. crowdsourced data) specially over
the timeline of COVID-19 crisis. For this study, Twitter Search APIs is used to collect and store
public agencies crisis interactions through social media outlets. Natural language processing and
machine learning techniques are adopted here to extract user concerns, response, and needs over
time. Besides, Worldometer data (crowdsource data) is used for extracting the daily number of
cases and deaths due to COVID-19 for United States.
The goal of the study is to reveal different agencies perspective during COVID-19 that
exists in social media interactions. To achieve this goal, the first key data source we considered is
twitter data. We were particularly interested in the tweets generated from major public health
agencies (WHO and CDC), disaster management (FEMA) and transportation agencies (FDOT).
Hence, we collected historical tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic of these four major agencies
to perform the analysis. The summary of the collected twitter data is given below, which shows
that WHO was the most active on Twitter than any other organization. All the twitter data were
collected from 02.21.2020 to 06.06.2020 which is around three and half months.

ANALYSES AND RESULTS
To reveal the interaction patterns of the public organizations, several machine learning
algorithms; e.g. sentiment analysis and topic frequency over time are applied here. The graphical
representations and the result interpretations of the tweets from four public organizations are listed
below.
WHO Interactions
To understand the dynamics of communication pattern, 15 optimum number of topics were
identified from static topic model analysis of WHO tweets. In Figure 1a, the topic frequencies are
plotted along with the time and in Figure 1b, average sentiment score of tweets are plotted over
the same timestamp. WHO emphasized on community transmission and the need of vaccine in
March; lack of nurses was discussed (Figure 1a) at the beginning of April; shortage of PPE, need
of staying home and importance of wearing masks became prominent from late April and in May;
all of these should be emphasized from January (beginning of the pandemic). Requirement of
Government support got notified in the beginning of May. These late responses show the clear
deficiency in preparedness to handle the pandemic situation. Also, the number of cases (COVID19 in countries topic) found increasing after 1.5 months’ time interval. Several other topics such
as importance of health concerns, responses in different countries, social measures, and use of
tobacco got attention also from WHO in twitter.
By comparing Figure 1a and Figure 1b (rolling mean or 1-day running average), it can be
said that the tweet sentiment went to most negative while WHO emphasized on alarming number
of cases of COVID-19, lack of peoples’ responses, shortage of PPE and negative impact of using
tobacco. Then, positive sentiments have found when WHO discussed about need of government
support, responses from people, development of vaccine, importance of home quarantine and use
of tobacco to develop the vaccine. Hence, the use of tobacco considered as negative topic in the
beginning, but later it turned into positive topic.
CDC Interactions
From CDC tweets, 8 optimum number of topics are plotted over the three and half month
timeline in Figure 2a. CDC put importance on following their guideline consistently, increase in
number of cases in whole March, hospitalization rates at the end of April which also found frequent
after one month, pandemic stress in May rather than from the beginning, prevention of spread
during mid-April, contact tracing at the beginning of April and risk of older people in March and
May.
After comparing Figure 2a and Figure 2b, positive spikes in tweet sentiment have found
when CDC put emphasize on following their guideline from the beginning and mostly on May,
importance of contact tracing at the beginning of April, reducing the spread of the virus as well as
the pandemic stress. Besides, negative sentiments are observed when elderly people’s risk,
increased number of cases and hospitalization rates became more frequent in twitter.

FEMA Interactions
From around 2000 tweets of FEMA, 10 optimum number of topics frequency have
visualized in Figure 3a. FEMA discussed about the importance of critical information in April,
need of COVID-19 responses in mid-March and also after one month (mid-April), spreading of
the virus at the end of April and need of supplies and food in April and May. Hurricane season
also got attention of FEMA during the pandemic. Besides, FEMA emphasized on the importance
of COVID-19 testing from April to May which is not mentioned by WHO and CDC. Also, lack of

11
medical supply got notified from end of the March, April and May which shows after each month
medical supply in US is needed.
By interpreting Figure 3a and 3b together, the extreme negative sentiments are observed
when the need of medical supplies, lack of food and the emergence of upcoming hurricane season
along with the increased spreading of the virus are discussed. Then, positive sentiments have found
while importance of COVID-19 testing, availability of responses, fund and spreading of critical
information got more importance.

FDOT Interactions
FDOT tweets showed 8 optimum topics which are envisaged over time in Figure 4a. FDOT
emphasized on working together to be successful over COVID-19 from May, travel and COVID19 related information in March, use of airports in the beginning of April, roadway construction
work consistently, importance of social distancing from April and the spreading of coronavirus in
Floridians consistently.
By comparing Figure 4a and 4b, spikes in positive sentiments have found when the
importance of social distancing, effectiveness of working together throughout the pandemic and
restricted roadway construction work have discussed. In the other hand, extreme negative
sentiments have observed while alarming spread of COVID-19, increase in number of cases among
Floridians and use of airport topics became more frequent in Twitter.

DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS
To identify the specific interaction patters along with the sentiments which caused the
changes (increase and decrease) in the number of cases and deaths in US, the topic dynamics and
sentiments over time are represented along with the number of cases and deaths of COVID-19
from Worldometer data (24) in Figure 5a and Figure 5b as following. From both Figure 5a and 5b,
it is obvious that the number of cases and deaths started to increase rapidly from 20 March and hit
the first pick (around 40,000 cases and 2,500 deaths per day) around 10 April. In this time duration,
WHO discussed more about the lack of social measures, responses, requirement of adequate
number of nurses, importance of wearing face masks; CDC emphasized on need of contact tracing,
failure of preventing the spread and suggesting to follow their guidelines; FEMA mentioned about
shortage of medical supplies, responses and need of critical information; and FDOT stated about
the use of airports, continuous roadway construction works and lack of social distancing. All of
these topics contribute to the increase in number of cases and deaths. If the entities put importance
on these topics at the beginning of the pandemic (January 2020), then the number of cases and
deaths could be much lower.
Then, the number of cases and deaths remained nearly constant from 11 April to 10 May.
In this time, importance of social distancing, increase in funding, response and support from
government, essence of pandemic stress management, new measures to prevent the spread and the
requirement of PPE have started becoming into the discussion focus. The result of emphasizing on
these issues is obvious from the last portion (11 May to 6 June) of the graphs (Figure 5a and 5b)
where both the number of cases and deaths decreased. In this timeline, increased response from
people and government, awareness about the lowering hospitalization rates, following health
guidance, understanding the risk of elderly people, increased medical supply, and working together
also helped to reduce the number of cases and deaths which results in flattening the curve.
The text-based infographics showed in previous sections have revealed different
interaction patterns along with the sentiments from the four major public agencies during the
pandemic. These interactions were actually generated from most frequently appeared words in
different topics form these entities which are listed below in different timeline. The entire time is
divided into four sub-period based on the lockdown (13 March) and reopening (beginning of May)
time in USAfter analyzing all the results and infographics, the noteworthy findings are listed in below





All the organizations discussed about the increased number of COVID-19 cases, need of
responses from both people and government and spreading of the virus.
The unique topics WHO discussed are the importance of PPE and wearing masks, home
quarantine, need of nurses and vaccine, emergence of community transmission and the
both negative and positive use of tobacco.
CDC specifically mentioned about the importance of contact tracing, pandemic stress
management and the negative impact of increased hospitalization rates.
FEMA is the only organization who emphasized on the importance of COVID-19 testing,
lack of medical supplies and the emergence of upcoming hurricane season along with the
pandemic.
FDOT put importance on social distancing, negative impact of using airports and roadway
construction works.

Only WHO discussed about the importance of wearing face mask on April and FEMA
emphasized on COVID-19 testing on May which should be focused earlier and contributed
to the initial increase of the number of cases and deaths in US.
Before the lockdown time (Table 1), organizations discussed about community
transmission, spreading of the virus, emergency management and health concerns along
with the need of doctors.
Just after the lockdown (20 March to 10 April), organizations emphasized on shortage of
nurses, medical supplies, social distancing and contact tracing, which contributed to the
Sudden jump in cases and deaths.

During the lockdown (11 April-10 May), public agencies highlighted about the importance
of social distancing, pandemic stress management, PPE requirement and the need of
Government support to manage the pandemic.
In the reopening phase (11 May to 06 June), organizations focused on managing
hospitalization rate, risk of older people, adequate medical supplies and following the
helath guidance, which eventually helped to reduce the number of cases and deaths.

This study identified specific topics in Twitter which influenced the change in number of
cases and deaths across US. Findings could help policy makers to take better preparation for the
next steps of the ongoing pandemic as well as in future pandemic situations.
CONCLUSIONS ANF FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS
Social media is considered as an effective information dissemination platform and showed
prevalence in recent times. The influence of information received through social media on public
behavior and decision-making is remarkable. However, spread of misinformation and information
overload may impede public risk perception and personal protective actions. Exploring the origins
of such information in times pandemic are inevitable, as such, Twitter interactions from agencies
such as WHO, CDC, FEMA and FDOT were observed in this study in the emergence and outbreak
of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). A total of 8,600 tweets were analyzed from these four major
public organizations. Several machine learning techniques such as (i.e. topic mining and sentiment
ratings over time) are applied here to identify the dynamics of emergent topics during this
unprecedented time. WHO was found to be the most active in social media during the first three
and half month of COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the other agencies.
Results also indicate that most agencies were less vocal on the importance of face covering
except for WHO in April which could have brought into attention earlier. Lack of healthcare
professional, medical supplies, contact tracing, and social distancing may have contributed to the
sudden increase in both number of cases and deaths in US. However, the importance of virus
testing was emphasized more by FEMA along with the concerns about the upcoming hurricane
season. CDC focused more on pandemic stress management and monitoring the hospitalization
rates. FDOT discussed more about COVID situation in Florida, travel information, use of airports
and construction during the pandemic. Finally, higher levels of social media interactions from
agencies on social distancing and vulnerability of older people seemed to have contributed in
reducing number of cases and deaths in US.
The findings of this research can support public health, emergency management, transportation
and other agencies more efficient transfer of risk and response information as communities shift
to new normal as well as in future pandemics. This can be done by identifying more effective
information dissemination strategies for diverse user groups based on their social network
characteristics, activities, and interactions in response to similar public health hazards. This study
identified specific Twitter interaction topics from major agencies which may have influenced the
community response and disease outbreak indicators of the pandemic. The methodologies, and
implications of this research can be transferred in designing effective intervention policies to other
natural and man-made disaster contexts in which public health risks become major concerns. The
study considered up to 3,200 tweets from the four agencies due to the limitation set by Twitter on
historical tweets, future studies should consider more agencies and more recent timeline.
