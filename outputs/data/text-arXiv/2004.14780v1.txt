Abstract. The goal of this article is to analyze some compartmental models specially
designed to model the spread of a disease whose transmission has the same features as
COVID-19. The major contributions of this article are: (1) Rigorously find sufficient
conditions for the outbreak to only have one peak, i.e. for no second wave of infection
to form; (2) Investigate the formation of other waves of infection when such conditions
are not met; (3) Use numerical simulations to analyze the different roles asymptomatic
carriers can have. We also argue that dividing the population into non-interacting
groups leads to an effective reduction of the transmission rates.
As in any compartmental model, the goal of this article is to provide qualitative
understanding rather than exact quantitative predictions.

1. Introduction
1.1. Context. Compartmental models, based on ordinary differential equations, have
a long history of use in epidemiology. Indeed, it is now almost a century since William
Ogilvy Kermack and Anderson Gray McKendrick introduced the well known SIR model,
[MK], on which most compartmental modeling elaborates on. Their relevance stems
for their extreme simplicity and ability to capture important qualitative behaviors,
rather than their limited capacity to make quantitative predictions. As a matter of fact,
the current outbreak of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is teaching us that most

models, not only the compartmental ones, are of very limited quantitative predictive
capacity. Nevertheless, there are important qualitative features of outbreaks that one
may attempt to capture, for instance: under which conditions can one guarantee that
there will be only one peak? This stands as a very important question which ought
to be answered if one is to effectively prevent a second, or third wave of infections.
Specially, having in mind the concerns to be taken once a first wave have passed. The
goal of this article is to propose and analyze some compartmental models which have
been constructed to capture some important features of diseases such as COVID-19.
Its two major characteristics which are not captured by the standard compartmental
models are:
(i) The long incubation period, during which the individuals that have been exposed
do not yet develop symptoms but are already contagious (at least in the second
half of that period). Even though the standard compartmental models do not
take into account the contagiousness of the exposed individuals, they are easy
to modify in order to account for it.
(ii) There is a non-negligible fraction of the contagious population which either has
mild symptoms or never develops them, thus passing undetected. These are the
so-called asymptomatic carriers. After some period of time they are no longer
contagious and, as the infected individuals, developed anti-bodies. This suggests
they are, at least for now, immune. The standard compartmental models which
have a carrier mode are not suitable for modeling such a behavior.
In this article, namely in Sections 3 and 4, we analyze some compartmental models that
have been specially designed to handle these two features. The resulting compartmental
models are more complicated than the standard ones and using a mix of precise and
numerical results, we shall answer some fundamentally important questions which we
now pose:
Question 1. Regarding each of the models:
(a) Are there disease-free equilibrium states?
(b) Having answered positively to (a), one may ask whether there are necessary or
sufficient conditions for these disease free equilibrium states to be stable in some
sense.
Question 2. Again, for each of the models one can ask:
(a) Are there criteria guaranteeing that any outbreak of the epidemic will have a
unique peak?

REFINED COMPARTMENTAL MODELS, ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIERS AND COVID-19

3

(b) If these criteria are violated, can the outbreak have other separate peaks, i.e.
second, third waves and so?
(c) Can these possible later peaks be higher than the first?
Depending on which model one considers, these two questions will be answered
separately in Sections 3 and 4. For instance, using the more refined model we give in
Corollary 1 and Remark 11 a quantitative condition ensuring only one peak will form.
The broad conclusion is that if all transmission rates are kept sufficiently small, then
only one peak form, which answers item (a) of question 2. If this condition is not met,
more peaks can form as we show in example 5 and these can be higher, thus answering
items (b) and (c) of question 2 above.
As for the next question, it will not be answered in any precise way but we shall give
some evidence on how to answer it based on numerical results. This will be done in the
examples 3, 4 and 5 presented in subsection 4.3.
Question 3. What is the role of asymptomatic carriers? Can they help the spread of
the disease and thus make the outbreak worse by anticipating and increasing its peak
and/or can they shield the rest of the population by creating herd immunity.
One other major question which one poses now is related to the quantifying by how
much specific policies reduce the rate of transmission.
Question 4. Is there a strategy to effectively reduce the rate of transmission in a
manner that can be quantified?
Broadly speaking, for the general strategy or policy it is hard, if not impossible, to
make such a quantitative analysis. For instance, how can we predict by how much the
use of masks by the general population reduces the rate of transmission? or washing
hands? Indeed, it is impossible to say it a-priori. We only know that these measures do
reduce the rate of transmission but not by how much. Having this in mind, we propose
one further measure whose contribution to the reduction of the transmission rate can be
quantified using the models. The “idea” is to split the population into n different groups
which are supposed to never interact, this reduces the contact rate of any individual by
a factor of n thus reducing the overall transmission rates by a factor of n. This intuitive
argument can be made more precise using the models we use. The last section of this
article, Section 5, is dedicated to making such an argument and running a simulation.
We shall also explain how this relates to our answer to the questions 1 and 2 above.
1.2. A note on the timing of this article. Once we are through the worst part
of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak with relative success, meaning that only

4

GONÇALO OLIVEIRA

a small fraction of the population got infected and so we cannot count with group
immunity, the question we must pose is: How can we proceed and go back to a relative
normality so that a putative second wave is as mild as possible?
I hope that the answers to question 2 above, stated as Proposition 2 and as Corollary 1
depending on the model, may serve as good indication that it is possible, but difficult, to
have only one peak. They quantify and show what one could already suspect, that the
way to do so is to reduce all the transmission rates. It is enough that one transmission
rate be high for the outbreak to be out of control, see Conclusion 6. How to keep the
transmission rates small remains a formidable challenge which I do not attempt at
answering.
As said before, there is no way to quantify how most policies reduce the transmission
rates. In that direction Section 5 explains a strategy, which may be difficult to implement,
but whose effect on the transmission rate can be pined down.
Disclaimer 1. I understand that the strategy of splitting the population into noninteracting groups is of difficult implementation. I do believe it cannot be literally
implemented in a society which respects our civil liberties and so would remain at
the level of a request to the population, which one would hope to be understood. Of
course, in that scenario the different groups would interact, even if mildly. Having such
considerations into account leads to modifications of the proposed solutions which will
consequently modify the models one should use into mathematically more intractable
ones. We may hope that the increased mathematical sophistication of those models will
not lead to substantially different qualitative outcomes but instead quantitative ones. In
any case, one must understand that the models are simply that: attempts to model a
reality which is much more complex. They are, by no means, a truthful reflection of the
real world.

2. A discussion of possible compartmental models
Recall that the main goal of this article is to find a good and simple compartmental
models which realistically capture the properties of a disease similar to COVID-19, at
least in terms of the dynamics of transmission. We intend to capture the following:

REFINED COMPARTMENTAL MODELS, ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIERS AND COVID-19

5

(i) Account for the contagiousness of exposed individuals which may have a long
incubation period;
(ii) Account for asymptomatic carriers;
(iii) Account for the possibly non-negligible mortality rate associated with the disease.
In fact, looking at a time scale of a few months it is actually conceivable that the
background birth and death dynamics be negligible when compared with the death rate
associated with the disease itself. Thus, in such a time scale, it is perhaps more realistic
to only associate a death rate to the infected population. For an introduction to the
use of compartmental models in epidemiology se for example [C] and [AR].
2.1. The modified SEIR model. We shall start by constructing a version of the SEIR
model where S, E, I, R represent the fraction of the population which is susceptible,
exposed, infected and recovered respectively. In order to keep the system as simple
as possible one may attempt to regard the asymptomatic carriers as being part of the
exposed population. For this one must regard each exposed individuals as representing
an average of someone that is in the incubation period and an asymptomatic carrier.
We are then led to the following system
(2.1)

Ṡ = −βi IS − βe ES

(2.2)

Ė = βi IS + βe ES − aE

(2.3)

I˙ = aE − γI − µI

(2.4)

Ṙ = γI,

for some positive functions of time βe , βi , a, γ. The parameters βe , βi represent the
transmission rates for the exposed and infected respectively, a denotes the rate of
transition from the exposed to infected state and γ the rate of recovery. For example,
in the easiest case, one would take
βi =

βi
βe
, and βe =
,
S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t)
S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t)

for some constants βe , βi . This is not the standard SEIR model as we are forcefully
making the exposed interact with the susceptible as the first of these are assumed to be
contagious. The analysis of this model is the scope of Section 3.
2.2. The SEIAR model. There are at least two easy ways to further refine this model.
First, we may split the exposed into two groups, those which are not yet infectious
and those which already are. Secondly, we may have some of these exposed passing
directly to the recovered state to account for the asymptomatic carriers which never

6

GONÇALO OLIVEIRA

develop symptoms and have therefore passed undetected. Thirdly, we may distinguish
the asymptomatic carriers in a more effective way as they may remain so for a longer
period of time.
2.2.1. Splitting the exposed into groups (SEEIR). We may attempt at splitting the
exposed into two new compartments, the initially exposed Ei and the final exposed
state Ef . The idea is that the initially exposed ones are not yet contagious while the
final are. To account for the first two requirements above we propose the following
system.

Ṡ = −βi IS − βe Ef S
Ėi = βi IS + βe Ef S − ai Ei
Ėf = ai Ei − af Ef − γe Ef
I˙ = af Ef − γi I − µI
Ṙ = γi I + γe Ef .
I expect this model to be quite good at capturing many qualitative the phenomena.
However, given the interest in explicitly analyzing the asymptomatic carriers we shall
instead focus on a different model.
2.2.2. Having the asymptomatic carriers separate (SEAIR). The goal of this model is
to better capture the effects of asymptomatic carriers. In the case of COVID-19 we do
know this to be a non-trivial part of all those which are contagious. However, given the
small number of anti-bodies tests that have been made so far, not much quantitative
knowledge regarding these is known.
In order to account for the asymptomatic carriers we consider one more compartment
of the population, denoted by A, which represents the fraction of the population which
is an asymptomatics carrier. Then, we propose the following model

Ṡ = −βi IS − βe ES − βa AS
Ė = βi IS + βe ES + βa AS − ai E − aa E
Ȧ = aa E − γa A
I˙ = ai E − γi I − µI
Ṙ = γi I + γa A,

REFINED COMPARTMENTAL MODELS, ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIERS AND COVID-19

7

for some positive functions of time βi , βe , βa , ai , aa , γi , γa , µ which need not be
constants. This system will be carefully analyzed in Section 4. For now, we shall simply
comment on the biological meaning of all the parameters on the model. Similar remarks
hold for the parameters of the simpler SEIR type model. The βi , βe , βa respectively
represent the transmission rates of the infected, exposed (in th incubation period),
and asymptomatic individuals. The parameters ai , aa represent the rate at which the
exposed individuals respectively pass to the infected and asymptotic compartments. In
ai
a
particular, ai +a
and aia+a
respectively represent the fraction of the population which if
a
a
exposed will eventually become infected or asymptomatic. The quantity γi−1 represents
the average time an infected individual takes to recover, while γa−1 is the average time
an asymptomatic individual takes to stop being contagious. Finally, µ stands for the
death rate associated with the disease. For example, in the easiest case one would take
βi =

βi
S(t) + E(t) + A(t) + I(t) + R(t)

for a constant βi with similar formulas for βe and βa . For convenience, we show in figure
1 a diagrammatic presentation of this model. A somewhat similar model have also

recently been used in [Re] and in [Vo]. The first of these attempted at predicting the
fraction of undocumented infections for COVID-19 in China. One other similar version
of it using Markov Chains have also recently been used to predict the spatiotemporal
spread of COVID-19 in Spain, see [Ae] for this work.
2.3. Refining the models. There are a few natural ways to further refine the models
proposed above.

8

GONÇALO OLIVEIRA

2.3.1. With exposed split and asymptomatic carriers separate (SEEAIR). This is a
combination of the previous two models proposed in subsection 2.2. This models also
splits the exposed population in two groups and includes the asymptomatic carriers as
well.

Ṡ = −βi IS − βe Ef S − βa AS
Ėi = βi IS + βe Ef S + βa AS − aE
Ėf = aEi − af Ef − aa Ef
Ȧ = aa E − γa A
I˙ = ai E − γi I − µI
Ṙ = γi I + γa A.
This differs from the previous model by the splitting E = Ei + Ef with the Ei not yet
infectious. The Ef may then become visibly infected (I) or only exhibit mild symptons
or even completely asymptomatic (A).

2.3.2. With birth and death dynamics. We can further refine the previous model by
including a birth and death dynamics. We assume there is a birth rate Λ of healthy
individuals and a normal death rate µn by other conditions totally unrelated to the
disease which affects all the population. In this manner the model becomes

Ṡ = Λ − βi IS − βe Ef S − βa AS − µn S
Ėi = βi IS + βe Ef S + βa AS − aE − µn Ei
Ėf = aEi − af Ef − aa Ef − µn Ef
Ȧ = aa Ef − γa A − µn A
I˙ = ai Ef − γi I − µI − µn I
Ṙ = γi I + γa A − µn R.
As we are interested in running the model for short periods of time, such as a few
months, I expect the birth rate to be relatively small and so negligible. Similarly, as
the normal death rate equally affects the whole populating I believe that including it in
the model will simply lead to unimportant complications.

3. The simplest somewhat realistic model
The goal of this section is to analyze the model proposed in subsection 3. For
convenience we recall here the system of ordinary differential equations ruling it.

(3.1)

Ṡ = −βi IS − βe ES

(3.2)

Ė = βi IS + βe ES − aE

(3.3)

I˙ = aE − γI − µI

(3.4)

Ṙ = γI.

It is straightforward to check that all S, E, I, R remain nonnegative and that S + E +
I + R is non-increasing and so S + E + I + R ≤ S(0) + E(0) + I(0) + R(0) = 1.
3.1. The linearized system. From the last equation above, i.e. 3.4, a critical point
(S, E, I, R) = (Sc , Ec , Ic , Rc )
will certainly have Ic = 0 which then also gives Ec = 0 from the semi-last equation
3.3. Then, the reaming equations 3.1 and 3.2 we conclude that Rc and Sc can be any
two constants so that Rc + Sc ≤ 1. These are disease free equilibrium points and are
obviously not isolated. Thus, the Grobman-Hartmann theorem cannot be applied but I
believe the linearization to still carry important information. Thus, we shall linearize
the system around such an equilibrium and use it to define the following notion.
Definition 1. Given a disease free equilibrium point (Sc , 0, 0, Rc ) is called infectiouslystable if the associated linear system is such that any of its solutions (s, e, i, r) satisfies
lim i(t) = 0.

t→+∞

Intuitively, we may think of this condition as saying that perturbing away from the
equilibrium always makes the disease to get extinct. In what follows of this linear
analysis we shall suppose βi , βe are constant which is a reasonable assumption for large
t  1. In order to study their stability, we shall now linearize the equations around
these equilibria. The linearized system is given by
ṡ = −βi Sc i − βe Sc e
ė = βi Sc i + βe Sc e − ae
i̇ = ae − (γ + µ)i
ṙ = γi.

10

GONÇALO OLIVEIRA

Clearly, the dynamics of (e, i) controls the whole dynamics which evolve independently.
The stability is therefore dependent on the sign of the eigenvalues. As we want both of
these two be negative we need to have det(A) > 0 and tr(A) < 0, where A is the matrix
!
βe Sc − a
βi Sc
A=

a
−(γ + µ)
which controls the system. Thus, the condition for stability is
−(γ + µ)(βe Sc − a) − aβi Sc > 0
βe Sc − (γ + µ) < 0,
which we can rewrite as
aβi Sc < (γ + µ)(a − βe Sc )
βe Sc < (γ + µ).
The second of this equations says that the rate at which the exposed infect other people
must be smaller than the rate of recovery (plus the death rate). The first says that not
only the exposed must be infecting people slower than they pass to the infected state
(βe Sc < a) but also, the already infected must infect others at a very very slow rate
when compared to the recovery rate. More precisely, we have obtained the following
result.

Lemma 1. For the generic values of βe , βi , a, γ, µ. The disease free equilibrium
(Sc , 0, 0, Rc ) is infectiously-stable if

Remark 1. It is possible to reduce the population of those infected keeping many people

have the transmission rate of those exposed small when compared to the rate of recovery,
i.e.

Furthermore, one must have the rate of transmission of those infected even smaller
when compared with rate of recovery, namely that


which in particular also assumes that βe < a, i.e. that the rate at which the exposed
infect the susceptible is small when compared with the rate of transition from the exposed
to infected state. We may also rewrite this last condition as

which suggests regard the left-hand-side as an analogue of the basic reproduction rate
for this model.
Achieving these conditions may, however, be a difficult task to accomplish. If they are
not, then the final population of susceptible may be very low which is quite bad.
3.2. Global stability. We shall now find a sufficient condition for a solution to the
system 3.1–3.4 to asymptotically approach a disease free equilibrium state. With this
in mind, it is convenient to abstract such a notion as follows.
Definition 2. A solution (S, E, I, R) to 3.1–3.4 is called asymptotically disease free if
lim E(t) + I(t) = 0.

t→+∞

Then, (S, E, I, R) is asymptotically disease free.
Proof. Let ε ∈ (0, 1) to be fixed later and consider the function Lε (t) = E(t) + εI(t).
Then, using equations 3.2 and 3.3 we compute

Then, by the assumption 3.6 there is ε ∈ (0, 1) such that supt≥0 γ+µ

L̇ε ≤ −δLε ,
for some δ > 0. Then, Grönwall’s inequality yields that Lε ≤ Lε (0)e−δt and thus
converges to 0 as t → ∞. In particular, as both E and I are non-negative we find that
both of these must converge to 0.

for the same conclusion to hold. Furthermore, it shows that under the above hypothesis,
both E and I exponentially converge to 0.
3.3. Examples and numeric simulations.
Example 1. Consider this model with S(0) = 0.99, I(0) = 0, E(0) = 0.01 and R(0) = 0
(for small nonzero I(0), E(0) the outcome seems to not be very dependent on the precise
value) whose simulation is shown in figure 2. In this precise case, only a very small
fraction of the population got away without being infected. Indeed, form equation 3.5

and initial conditions S(0) = 0.99, I(0) = 0, E(0) = 0.01 and R(0) = 0.
The red, blue, green and purple curves respectively denote the fraction of

for the stability of the disease free equilibrium we find that it must satisfy

which is in agreement with what we see in figure 2.
On the other hand, we may consider the same model but supposing that social isolation
and other measures have been put in place to reduce the transmission rate. In figure 3
we run one such example. In this case, equation 3.5 gives that the stable disease free

Remark 3. It would be interesting to actually get a lower bound on Sc rather than an
upper bound.
3.3.1. Example with two peaks. We could now try and make βi and βe periodic in a
way that, on average, the inequalities in Conclusion 1 hold true. In that case, I expect
that, after the peak, the number of infected people will also decrease, in average, with
time. Of course, it may be that, with no extra measures, the actual values of βe and
βi are so high that by opening up (even if only for a short period of time) will make
the task of making the inequalities above hold in average very difficult. It is exactly
this scenario that we explore in the next example where after a strict control of the
transmission rate, it is once again allowed to become large. This is an alert to the
dangers of a non-careful reopening, after social distancing measures had been put in
place, for an insufficient time so that herd immunity develops. In this example we can
actually see that the second peak can be made larger than the first which provides an
answer to the items (b) and (c) in question 2.

14

Example 2. Figure 4 shows an example where after seeing positive signs in the decrease
in the number of infected, the rate of transmission is allowed to increase. This leads to
a formation of a second peak of infections which ends up infecting almost everyone.1
Indeed, we can see in the plot in figure 5 that the conditions in Conclusion 1 are violated

right before time t = 5. This leads to a change of tendency which will makes the curve
of infected restart increasing and eventually leading to the formation of the second peak.
This is an example of something we want to avoid.

problem (a) by question 2. Preferably a criteria depending on βe and βi which are the
quantities that can be somewhat controlled using social distancing and other measures.
We shall answer this question next in Proposition 2.
3.4. Rigorous qualitative results. First, notice that from the first equation 3.1 we
find that Ṡ ≤ 0 so S(t) is decreasing. Consider the asymptotic fraction of susceptible
population
Sc := lim S(t),
t→+∞

and recall that it is to our interest that Sc > 0 and as big as possible (of course
Sc ≤ S(0) ≤ 1). Similarly, we shall define Ic and Ec as the asymptotic values of I and
E if they exist.
Lemma 2. Suppose that Sc > 0, then Ic = 0 = Ec .
Proof. Again, from the first equation 3.1 we have
 Z t

S(t) = S(0) exp − (βi I + βe E)ds .

which will converge to zero if I and E do not themselves uniformly converge to zero. 
Political measures can more easily affect the transmission rate than the recovery and
death rate which are more dependent on medical conditions. Thus, in the next result
we find a, potentially useful, criteria for having only one peak which does not assume
the transmission rates βi , βe to be constant. This provides a rigorous answer to the
item (c) of question 2.

As between any two maxima there must be a minimum, in order for I to only have one

Remark 5. The previous result gives a criteria to guarantee that a second peak will
not form. For that, one must try and control the βe and βi so that equation 3.8 holds.

4. A model capturing asymptomatic carriers
In this section we analyze the model previously derived in 2.2.2 which was designed
to capture asymptomatic carriers. This model regards the exposed (E) in a slightly
different manner than in the more refined model 2.3.1. Namely, we consider the exposed
as only one state and average out their infectiousness. For convenience, we recall here
the system of equations governing this model.

(4.1)

Ṡ = −βi IS − βe ES − βa AS

(4.2)

Ė = βi IS + βe ES + βa AS − aa E − ai E

(4.3)

Ȧ = aa E − γa A

(4.4)

I˙ = ai E − γi I − µI

(4.5)

Ṙ = γi I + γa A.

From equation 4.1 we find that S(t) is decreasing and from adding 4.1 and 4.2 we
find that S(t) + E(t) as well.
4.1. Linear analysis. Let us now find the critical points of this system. From equations
4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 we find that for the generic values of aa , ai , γi , γa , µ all E, A, I must
vanish at a critical point. From the remaining equations we find that S and R can be
any arbitrary constants as long as S + R ≤ 1. We shall write such a critical point as
c = (S, E, A, I, R) = (Sc , 0, 0, 0, Rc ). Notice in particular that any such critical point is
disease free.
Then, the linearised system at such a critical point is given by
ṡ = −βi Sc i − βe Sc e − βa Sc a
ė = βi Sc i + βe Sc e + βa Sc a − (ai + aa )e
ȧ = aa e − γa a
i̇ = ai e − (γi + µ)i
ṙ = γi i + γa a.
In this case, we have that the equations for ẋ where x := (e, a, i) do control the whole
system. This subsystem is then given by ẋ = Ax where


While it is possible to compute the eigenvalues of this system in general, the formulas
are extremely unwieldy and so it is hard to find a general statement which decides on
the stability of the system in general. Nevertheless, as necessary condition for stability
is that det(A) < 0 and tr(A) < 0 which respectively give

If βe < ai + aa + γa + γi + µ, then the first equation above suggests that the quantity

may behave as the basic reproduction rate for this model. Hence, and in order to have
large (closed to 1) values of the asymptotic fraction of susceptible, we would like to
keep 4.7 below 1. This is then compatible with having Sc close to 1, at least from the
point of view of the first equation in 4.6.

18

GONÇALO OLIVEIRA

Remark 6. The above discussion suggests that for an outbreak to be under control we
must have βe < ai + aa + γa + γi + µ and the quantity in equation 4.7 must be kept below
1. Furthermore, from formula 4.7 one can immediately see that it is enough that one of
the transmission rates βe , βi , or βa to be large, for the outbreak to be out of control!
4.2. Global stability. As in subsection 3.2 we will now characterize the asymptotic
stability properties of the disease free equilibrium points of solutions to 4.1–4.5. As in
that subsection, it is convenient to abstract the notion of asymptotic stability for these
equilibrium.
Definition 3. A solution (S, E, A, I, R) to 4.1–4.5 is called asymptotically disease free
if
lim E(t) + A(t) + I(t) = 0.
t→+∞

Proposition 3. Let (S, E, A, I, R) be a solution to 4.1–4.5 satisfying

Then, (S, E, A, I, R) is asymptotically disease free. Furthermore, all E, A and I
exponentially converge to 0.
Proof. Following a similar strategy to that of subsection 3.2 we shall consider the
function Lε (t) = E(t) + εa A(t) + εi I(t) for constants εa , εi ∈ (0, 1) to be fixed at a later
stage. Then, it from equations 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 follows that
L̇ε = (βe ES + βa AS + βi IS − (aa + ai )E) + εa (aa E − γa A) + εi (ai E − (γi + µ)I)

Lε ≤ Lε (0)e−δt and thus converges exponentially to 0 as t → ∞.

4.3. Controlling an outbreak. The main problem when faced with an outbreak is
to keep it under control. But what does that mean in the context of the model we are
considering. One possible definition is that the asymptotic value os susceptible
Sc := lim S(t),
t→+∞

is large. Alternatively, we may attempt at keeping the total number of infected people,
i.e.
Z t
lim
I(s)ds,
t→+∞

0

as small as possible. The proof of Lemma 2 show that these two definitions are
equivalent for the model 3.1–3.4. However, in model at hand there is the possibility
that as susceptible passes to the recovered state taking the asymptomatic route which
makes this model fundamentally different. Indeed, from integrating the first equation
4.1 we find that
 Z t

S(t) = S(0) exp − (βi I + βe E + βa A)ds .
0

This shows that maximizing Sc is equivalent to minimizing
Z t
(βi I + βe E + βa A)ds.
0

From the point of view of the second definition, one regards the asymptomatic to be
innocuous, which seems reasonable from a purely medical point of view as they never
become sick. Furthermore, it is conceivable that they can create herd immunity which
shields the rest of the population. However, intuitively speaking, having a relatively
large number of asymptomatic may also be bad, at least initially while S is large, as they
may move undetected and “infect” even more people. The numerical conclusion to which
we arrive is that depending on the exact parameters of the model the asymptomatic
can carry both roles.

4.3.1. Examples. Below we shall run some simulations which seem to suggest the
previous intuitive reasoning to be correct in different settings. In order to this we
shall fix the parameters βi , βe , βa , γi , γa , µ and vary ai and aa . The examples in this

20

GONÇALO OLIVEIRA

section have been constructed in order to provide answers to the question 3 raised in
the Introduction.
Remark 8. A few words must be said about the choice of the parameters βi , βe , βa , ai , aa , γi , γa , µ
ruling the model. It is at the date medically impossible to determine the values of all
these and so it is meaningless to assign them specific values and pretend we are modeling
the true outbreak. Nevertheless, I must justify the values I will be assigning in my model.
I shall suppose that
βi < βe < βa ,
and recall that these encode the number of infections that the infected, exposed and
asymptomatic cause by unit time. This choice may seem strange but there is a reason
for this choice. I assume that the infected, while possibly being extremely infectious,
are dealt with carefully and so do not infect as many other people by unit time as the
exposed and asymptomatic. This justifies βi < βa and also βi < βe . The exposed, even
though not having been detected yet, are not as infectious as they will eventually become
later thus βe < βa . Notice that we do not have βe < βi as the infected individuals will
be detected and dealt with in a way that avoids further infections. Without this extra
care that inequality would hold. From all this we then have: βi < βe < βa , as claimed.
Next, we shall assume in our simulations that
γi < γa
which means that the average time γa−1 an asymptomatic individual takes to reduce its
viral charge to zero is smaller than the time an infected indivual needs γi−1 . This is
highly debatable and, even though seemingly reasonable, I have no way to better justify
this choice.
The simulation in the next example 3 illustrates a case where having a larger fraction
of asymptomatics carriers did not make the disease develop faster and actually lead to
a smaller peaks of infection. This need not always be the case as we shall later see in
example 4.
Example 3. In all the simulations we shall run in this example we shall have βi = 0.9,
βe = 1.5 and βa = 2.8 while γi = 0.8, γa = 1.2 and µ = 0.01.
In Figure 6 we shall plot the number of infected people, these are those which actually
get sick, as a function of time where we compare different simulations obtained with
the same value of ai + aa = 1 but different values of ai and aa individually. Indeed,
from this simulation we can infer that the smaller aa is, or equivalently the larger ai is,
the further high and late the peak is. Intuitively we can justify this from the fact that

REFINED COMPARTMENTAL MODELS, ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIERS AND COVID-19

21

Figure 6. In black, green, blue, red and purple the values of I(t) are
plotted for the simulations obtained from aa being 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and
0.9 respectively.
a large aa gives a lot of asymptomatic carriers, which when recovered create a group
immunity shielding the rest of the population.
I believe the values of the transmission rates βe , βi , βa in the previous example 3
are reasonable and somewhat realistic. Nevertheless, in order to better understand
the role that asymptomatic carriers can carry it is actually more convenient to slightly
exaggerate the values by having βa  βe . We shall do so in the next example which
illustrates one other role that asymptomatic carries can have. Namely, that in an early
stage, i.e. when S is still large, having more asymptomatic carriers can cause a faster
increase of the infected population anticipating and increasing the peak.
Example 4. In this example we use the same constants of the previous example except
for the values of βi and βa which we shall set to be βi = 0.5 and βa = 7. As explained
before, the fact that βa is so big when compared to βi means not only that the disease is
extremely contagious but also that those individuals which are showing symptoms are
isolated and handled extremely carefully while the asymptotic ones are not. In figure 7
we have plotted in black and green the simulation obtained when aa = 0.1 (and ai = 0.9)
and aa = 0.2 (and ai = 0.8) respectively. In this very particular example, we see that the
higher probability of an exposed person to become asymptomatic leads to higher degree
of contagion which itself leads to a higher earlier peak of the infected population. It is

22

GONÇALO OLIVEIRA

Figure 7. In black and green are the plots of I(t) for the simulations
obtained from aa being 0.1 and 0.2 respectively.
natural to inquire about the actual population of asymptomatic carriers in both of these
simulations, these are plotted in figure 8.

Figure 8. In black and green are the plots of A(t) for aa being 0.1, 0.2 respectively.
4.3.2. Second waves. In the simpler model given by the system 3.1–3.4 we saw in
Example 2 that a second wave can form. In the same manner as in that case, we expect

REFINED COMPARTMENTAL MODELS, ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIERS AND COVID-19

23

this will happen when the quantity


1
βi
βa

,

derived in subsection 4.1, rises above 1. We shall now see an example of a solution to
the model 4.1–4.5 for which a second wave forms. In fact, we shall see that the second
peak can be larger than the first and thus this example will serve as an answer to the
items (b) and (c) of question 2 using this more refined model. Also, we shall use this
opportunity to further elaborate on the role of asymptomatic carriers giving further
input towards question 3 in the Introduction.
Example 5. Let βi (t) = 0.9f (t), βe (t) = 1.5f (t), βa (t) = 2.8f (t), aa = 0.2 and
ai = 0.8, γi = 0.8, γa = 1.2 and µ = 0.01, for some function f (t) which was carefully
designed2 but whiose specific form is unimportant for now. As a matter of showing the
importance of the quantity 4.7 we shall plot this in figure 9 which we can see has two
large plateaus, well above 1, connected by a region where it is substantially smaller. The
simulation run for these values is presented in figure 10 and is made with the initial
conditions S(0) = 0.99, E(0) = 0.01, I(0) = 0 = R(0).
One sees that the first peak is too small for a sufficient fraction of the population to
acquire immunity and the high increase of the rate of transmissions, here enconded in
the quantity 4.7 leads to a second peak of the outbreak. Indeed, this second wave of
the outbreak creates an even larger peak than the first. Of course, the actual values of
the transmission rates we used in this example may not be well adapted for a realistic
modeling.3 Nevertheless, this serves as an example to stress the possibility of having a
second outbreak that may be worse than the first.
As a way of comparison, and to further investigate on the role of asymptomatic carriers,
we present in figure 11 a simulation of the same model except that we now have a much
higher fraction of asymptomatic carriers, in this case aa = 0.8 and ai = 0.2. This
means that each individual has a 80 per cent probability of becoming asymptomatic when
exposed to the disease. In this case, we see that the large quantity of asymptomatic
carriers keeps the peaks of infection much smaller. In fact, we also find that in this
case the second peak is smaller. This can be interpreted in terms of the herd immunity
acquired by the asymptomatic carriers which shields the rest of population while keeping
the number of infections smaller.
2We

are using f (t) = 10
+ S37 (2 − t) + S37 (t − 7) where S37 (t) is the sum of the first 37 terms of the
Fourier series of the Heaviside function on [−20, 20].
3Even though, I have tried to make them as reasonable as I could.

Remark 9. Example 5 raises the question of whether it is possibly to find conditions
under which an outbreak will develop a unique peak. This is precisely the constant of
item (a) in question 2. As we shall see in Corollary 1 of the next section such a criteria
can be found and cast in terms of the quantity 4.7.

4.4. Precise qualitative results. As in Lemma 2 we find that in order for
Sc := lim S(t),
t→+∞

to be positive we must have all A(t), I(t) and E(t) converging to zero as t → +∞. The
other natural easy question to investigate is that of finding criteria for which there
will be only one peak of the outbreak, very much as done in Proposition 2 for the
simpler model 3.1–3.4. Here, we shall find an analogue of that which holds under more
restrictive hypothesis.
Proposition 4. Let (S, E, A, I, R) be a solution to 4.1–4.5 with ai , aa , γi , µ constant
aa
and Sc > 0. Then, there is a constant c > 0 so that A ≤ c γiγ+µ
I for all t ≥ 0.
a ai
Furthermore, if



the function I(t) has at most one critical point and this is a maximum if it exists.
Proof. First notice that as Sc > 0 we have that both A and I converge to zero and so
there is a constant c as in the statement. Thus, in order to prove the result we shall
follow the strategy of Proposition 2. This consists in finding conditions which guarantee
that I¨ < 0 at any critical point of I. If that is the case, then I can have no minimum
and thus will have at most one maximum, as in-between any two maxima there must

26

be a minima. Thus, we start by computing
I¨ = ai Ė − (γi + µ)I˙
˙
= ai ((βi I + βe E + βa A) S − (ai + aa )E) − (γi + µ)I,
which at a critical point of I further satisfies I˙ = 0, i.e. ai E = (γi + µ)I, and so we can

Of course, one would like to keep S(t) as close to one as possible and so the first of this
seems to be a more reasonable test. Furthermore, it does not require to know the value
of S(t) but that of the ratio A(t)/I(t) which may be obtained by sampling with anti-body
tests for example.
Of course, the previous proposition would be much more useful if for any given
solution (S, E, A, I, R) one can determine the value of c.
Lemma 3. Let (S, E, A, I, R) be a solution to 4.1–4.5. Then, for all t ≥ 0 we have

aa
A(t) ≤ I(t).

Putting this Lemma 3 together with Proposition 4 we find the following Corollary.
This serves as a rigorous answer to the inquire raised in item (a) of question 2.
Corollary 1. Let (S, E, A, I, R) be a solution to 4.1–4.5 with ai , aa , γi , µ constant and
Sc > 0. Suppose that ai A(0) ≤ aa I(0), γa ≥ γi + µ and

Then, the function I(t) has at most one critical point and this is a maximum if it exists.
Remark 11. In the previous Corollary 1, the hypothesis that γa > γi + µ holds
immediately if the average time for an asymptomatic carrier to stop being contageous is
smaller than that required by the average infected individual. Still under this hypothesis,

which should be compared with Conclusion 6.

5. Grouping the population
Recall that the idea to be implemented and tested is that of splitting the population
into n groups which, to first approximation, do not interact. This obviously supposes
that in each household there are only people of the same group as otherwise it would
be impossible to guarantee that they do not mix.
We shall simply describe how the situation works by using the simplest possible
model, namely the modified SEIR model described by equations 3.1–3.4. For the SEIAR
model the situation is similar and the argument follows exactly the same lines.
P
We start by splitting the fraction of susceptible population as S = nk=1 Sk with similar
splits for E, I and R. Suppose that people from each group only interact with those of
their group, i.e. that for all i, j ∈ {1, . . . , k} and i 6= j, no person from group i meets a
person from group j. Then, each k ∈ {1, . . . , k} we have that (Sk , Ek , Ik , Rk ) solves
Ṡk = −βi Ik Sk − βe Ek Sk
Ėk = βi Ik Sk + βe Ek Sk − aEk
I˙k = aEk − γIk − µIk
Ṙk = γIk .
If we suppose that all populations follow the same dynamics with the same initial data
then S1 = . . . = Sn and so Sk = S/n for each k = 1, . . . , n, and similarly Ek = E/n,
Ik = I/n, Rk = R/n. Then, the system above turns into

29

This is the same system as that we started with but with the transmission rates β’s
replaced by β/n. This cuts the rate of propagation by dividing it by the number of
groups in which the population was split.
Remark 12. The exact same reasoning leads to a similar conclusion using the model
4.1–4.5.
Building on our Conclusion 1 we are lead to the following:
Conclusion 1. It is possible to reduce the rates of transmission in half, or third, ou
a fourth, and so on... Then, reducing it by a large enough factor, it is one can keep
a large fraction of the population Sc < S(0) < 1 still susceptible (without ever having
contracted the disease). One way to achieve thus is to do divide the population into n
groups which one supposes not to physically interact with one another. Then, one keeps
n large enough so that

In fact, we should actually require that βne  γ + µ and n1 γ+µ
+ βae  1, so that the
final fraction of the population which is still susceptible is as high as possible.
Using instead the model 4.1–4.5 and having in mind Corollary 1 and Remark 11, if
γa ≥ γi + µ and ai A(0) ≤ aa I(0), then requiring that

guarantees that only one peak will form. Alternatively, if the ratio A/I is possible to
compute,4 then one may instead control the quantities put forward in remark 10.
Example 6. Consider the same numerical values as those we previously considered
in example 1 and figure 2. Recall that these are βi = 0.9, βe = 2.5, a = 1, γ = 0.9,
µ = 0.01 and initial conditions S(0) = 0.99, I(0) = 0, E(0) = 0.01, R(0) = 0. Also, the
curves with color red, blue, green and purple respectively denote the susceptible, exposed,
infected and recovered. In figure 3 the case when n = 2 is plotted. This is a substantial
improvement to the case of example 1. Indeed, we see that about 30 per cent of the
population got away without ever being infected. Even better is the case when n = 3
which is plotted in figure 12 just as a further example. This represents an extremely

good scenarium where the number of infected is kept very low and almost disappears by
time t = 30.
We shall now give an example using the more refined model from the system 4.1–4.5.
Example 7. Let βi = 0.9, βe = 1.5, βa = 2.8, while aa = 0.2, ai = 0.8 and γi = 0.8,
γi = 1.2, µ = 0.01. Set the initial conditions to be S(0) = 0.99, E(0) = 0.01, I(0) = 0,
R(0) = 0. Using, these values we run in figure 13 two simulations, one for the case
when n = 1 which means the population was not split at all and one for n = 2, i.e. the
population was split into two groups. This suggests that, indeed, splitting the population

into two groups leads to a much smaller peak. Nevertheless, it does take more time to
eliminate the infection.
