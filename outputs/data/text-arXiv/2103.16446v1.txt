A BSTRACT
We present a benchmark database of public social media postings from the United Kingdom related to
the Covid-19 pandemic for academic research purposes, along with some initial analysis, including a
taxonomy of key themes organised by keyword. This release supports the findings of a research study
funded by the Scottish Government Chief Scientist Office that aims to investigate social sentiment in
order to understand the response to public health measures implemented during the pandemic.

Introduction

The SARS-Cov-2 novel coronavirus popularly known as Covid-19 has provoked a worldwide response since its
designation as a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March 2020. As of November 2020,
almost 45 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 1.1 million deaths reported [1]. While the majority of
cases involve mild symptoms including cough, fever, diarrhoea and pain, some affected individuals can develop much
more acute symptoms, such as pneumonia or kidney failure. Especially vulnerable groups including elderly patients
and those suffering multiple co-morbidities have proven more susceptible to severe infection, and have presented a
correspondingly higher risk of hospitalisation [2].
The virus has been transmitted between humans primarily through respiratory action, with recent studies predicting the
rate of transmission between non-immune carriers at 3.77% [3]. Public health action has concentrated on reducing the
spread of the virus through travel travel restrictions, temporary closure of businesses and schools, social distancing
guidelines, and the implementation of test-and-trace systems. While there are a large number of ongoing studies into
vaccines and drug therapies [4, 5, 6, 7], no widely accessible prophylactic treatment is currently available.
Much current research has responded to the pandemic by urgently striving to understand and communicate aspects of
the social impacts to the public as well as combating pervasive myths [8, 9], a key role for researchers especially when
the public is faced with urgent choices demanding good access to information and the tools to understand potential
trade-offs between public health, security, and other social goals [10, 11].
Public health measures designed to restrict the spread of the virus like social distancing—reducing physical contact
between people [12, 13]—have however led to negative social effects such as the closure of many workplaces [14],
restrictions on personal mobility [15], and the closure of schools and universities [16, 17]. Under these circumstances,
a great deal of public discourse has moved to online social networks [18, 19], presenting an excellent opportunity to
gauge the mood of users.

A PREPRINT - M ARCH 31, 2021

We present a benchmark dataset drawn from online conversations in the United Kingdom about Covid-19-related
topics on both the Twitter and Facebook social networks. It is our hope that open access to this data will spur further
research into better informing and understanding public sentiment around the pandemic, as well as helping public health
professionals to make informed decisions when implementing.

Related Work

A number of datasets extracted from social media activity around the Covid-19 pandemic have previously been
published. Among those targeting a much wider geographic lens are Chen et al. [20], which adopts 22 keywords to
filter worldwide Twitter messages via the streaming API, resulting in a large multi-lingual unlabelled dataset. Lamsal
[21] used a similar approach, filtering with a list of 90 keywords and hashtags, as well as annotating the resultant dataset
with sentiment markers. Dimitrov et al. [22] extended this approach by adopting a 268 keyword list through which they
filtered the existing large-scale TweetsKB dataset [23].
In addition to this, multiple smaller datasets have been produced from Twitter encompassing linked niche topics
within the broader ambit of Covid-19, including the effects of Hydroxychloroquine [24], and various sources of
treatment misinformation [25]. Two sets that we found particularly of note that were not produced from Twitter are the
Weibo-COV dataset [26], extracted from the social network Weibo, and the Instagram dataset compiled by Zarei et al.
[27].
We note the current scholarship around the ethics of releasing the data of participants in social media research without
direct consent, especially [28, 29, 30]. However, we conducted a thorough assessment of the privacy risk to individuals
posed by our research, and along with complying with social network policies and the relevant sections of the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we believe our research is in the legitimate public interest. We have not shared or
published direct tweets or posts by individuals, quotes from individuals or names or locations of users who are not
public organisations/entities. We have also striven to comply with best practices for user protection [31, 32], as well as
ensuring that no non-public material is included in our dataset.

Methodology

3.1

Data collection

Our solution demanded that we implement a platform agnostic collection system capable of integrating with multiple
data sources. In order to achieve this, our primary data store was determined to be a Google Cloud-hosted BigQuery
database, into which we would load all records. We therefore designed our collection modules for individual platforms
as independent parts of the architecture, capable of being flexibly swapped in and out as required.
When working with Twitter data, we designed a containerised streaming listener application that could be deployed
quickly on any available host, which would connect to the network endpoint, establish a stream connection with a
number of possible pre-selected filters, and consume and log incoming messages constantly. This application was
connected to the endpoint on the 23rd of June at 09:38 GMT, and so the set contains messages from this point onwards.
In this study, we harvested messages within our defined regional boundaries, and defined our stream filter parameters to
harvest all messages tagged with a geographical location within the United Kingdom 1 . The Twitter 1.1 API specification
in use at the time of development 2 allowed the use of bounding box location filters only, and only returns Tweets that
have been tagged with Place information derived from the ’fine-grained location’ permission enabled by users.
Building on previous work [33, 34, 35], we determined the best solution in order to build a low-latency message
queuing and ingestion system was via Google Cloud Pub/Sub, through which we sent the extracted post fields to a
Cloud Function written in Python that cleaned and sequenced the data into our preferred format, before inserting it into
a BigQuery database. Table 1 for details of the fields included in the imported data.
We gained access to Facebook data through the Crowdtangle platform 3 , a Facebook-owned venture which allows
access to public post and group data through both visual dashboard tools and an API. In order to harvest Covid-related
material, we manually curated lists of important groups, pages and profiles through the web interface. These lists were
sorted into both Scotland-only and UK-wide.

Table 1: Input data formats

A scheduled script was set up to connect to the API, retrieve all lists attached to the project dashboard, retrieve all
posts made by lists members during the preceding 24 hours, then directly upload the results to the BigQuery database.
Unfortunately, the lack of a streaming interface precludes near-real-time updates, but this frequency of updates was
judged to be acceptable by the project team. Since Facebook posts were available for archive retrieval, we collected
posts beginning from the 1st of January 2020 at 00:01 GMT.
3.2

Processing

Pre-processing for data was limited to the removal of line ending characters (\n and \r), as well as annotation with a
theme ID determined by keyword frequency analysis, drawn from a pre-determined list of themes and keywords. Any
messages that could not have a theme label applied to them were tagged with a valence marker that ensured they would
not be entered for further analysis, and have not been published in the released dataset.
A set of priority COVID-19 themes and keywords, as displayed in Table 2, was developed in close consultation with
public health policy domain experts, led by the Covidtracker project co-Lead, Prof Sheikh at Edinburgh University
(member of the Scottish Government’s CMO COVID-19 Advisory Group), for potential integration into the Scottish
Government framework for decision making[36]. The latter is a policy document setting out the key focus of public
health and decision-making bodies when dealing with the pandemic. The COVID-19 themes were also updated in light
of public engagement exercises conducted by the government in order to derive priority topics of greatest public interest
[37].
A full list of the keywords used to filter for each theme can be found in Appendix A. Note: the themes have a zero-based
index for reasons of implementation.

Features

4.1

Publication and Hydration

In order to comply with network policies for researchers conducting data collection via the Twitter [38] and Crowdtangle
[39] platforms, we are able to share only the IDs of material that we collected. This precludes us from sharing the
location or text of our collected posts directly.
There are several tools that will enable researchers to rehydrate this data to return the full content of the post or profile.
For Twitter, we note that the DocNow Hydrator 4 and Tweepy Python library 5 can fulfil this function, however the
only option for rehydration of Crowdtangle-provided data is to apply for access to the platform and gain access to the
official API 6 . Examples of the structure and contents of the data returned from the network endpoints is conatined in
Appendices B and C.

Note: there are two separate IDs available for Facebook posts via the Crowdtangle API, the platform ID used by
Facebook itself, and the Crowdtangle ID, used by the analytics platform. We have provided the Crowdtangle ID in
our dataset, and so when hydrating posts the API endpoint http://api.crowdtangle.com/ctpost/:id should be
used.
