Abstract
By using 530 responses from an online questionnaire, this study aims to investigate the transition from
physical to online shopping alternatives during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic period at the
individual level. The focus areas of the study are Sweden and Italy, two European countries that
implemented contrasting prevention measures. This study analyses the impacts of the pandemic to the
shopping behaviour and identifies, among the respondents, who have changed the behaviour the most,
how respondents have adopted different shopping strategies, what the main differences between Italian
and Swedish responses are and the influence of population density on the behavioural change.
Multivariate statistical analyses, including linear and binary logistic regressions and multinomial logit
models were used to analyse the dataset. The results confirm the differences between Italy and Sweden in
terms of social distancing measures, social structures and technology readiness. Moreover, the
socio-demographic and household structures of the respondents were found instrumental in influencing
the amount and the direction of change in shopping behaviour during the first wave of the pandemic
period. The output of this study highlights the impact that contrasting policies have on citizens, and also
the importance of having policies that are adaptable to different situations.

1. Introduction
During 2020 the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic: since it first appeared in Wuhan at the end of
2019, the virus has spread worldwide (Arimura et al., 2020). As a consequence, many governments have
responded with different lockdown strategies (e.g. travel bans, stay-at-home orders, restrictions on
gatherings) designed to control the outbreak (Arimura et al., 2020; De Vos, 2020; Malik et al., 2020;
Rahman et al., 2020). Significant drops in the number of daily trips and public transport usage have been
observed worldwide (Almlöf et al., 2020; Beck & Hensher, 2020; Bin et al., 2020; Lozzi et al., 2020;
Molloy et al., 2020), but the pandemic had less effect on shopping trips (especially grocery and, to some
extent, other shopping trips), which are seen as necessary (Parady et al., 2020).
Most of the analysis to date focuses on the impacts of the pandemic and the lockdowns on passenger
movements, public transport riderships, and traffic reductions (e.g. Arimura et al., 2020; Chan et al.,
2020; De Vos, 2020, p. 19, 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020; Kunzmann, 2020; Parady et al., 2020; Pepe et al.,
2020; Warren & Skillman, 2020). Less focus has been paid to the behavioural transition process that
individuals need to make in their daily activities: for example, the shifting behaviour to virtual activities
due to the pandemic had a significant influence in shopping activities.
In this paper, the transition from physical to online shopping is studied through an online survey
distributed during the first wave of the pandemic period. In this study, the term first wave refers to the
first spike of cases of COVID-19, followed by a period of lockdown, in spring 2020 (Lisa Lockerd
Maragakis, 2020). In particular, the analyses focus on Italy and Swedish respondents, two counterparts in
Europe in terms of prevention measures, where Italy imposed a hard lockdown while Sweden’s strategy
was primarily based on recommendations from the government (Ministero della Salute, 2020;
Regeringskansliet, 2020).

The main research question of the study is: what are the impacts of the first wave of the COVID-19
pandemic period on the shift from physical to online shopping? The research sub-questions are the
following.

● RQ1 Who has changed the shopping behaviour the most?
During the first wave of the pandemic period, many people have changed their usual behaviour,
shifting towards online shopping and reducing the number of physical trips. In this paper, the
characteristics of those who have changed the behaviour the most are examined.

● RQ2 How do respondents adopt different shopping strategies during the first wave
of the pandemic period?
During the lockdown period, people had different capabilities to evaluate the risk, adjust their
daily patterns to the restrictions and adopt the alternative digital solutions for their daily shopping
needs. Whilst such transformation may come natural to some groups of society, it is challenging
for others. This could result in some socio-demographic groups who did not feel safe enough to
travel, but at the same time were not capable enough to resort to virtual alternatives during the
first lockdown period. These groups could be excluded from society and be not capable of
fulfilling their daily needs.

● RQ3 What are the main differences between Italy and Sweden?
During the first wave of the pandemic period, Italy and Sweden acted very differently in terms of
policies and restrictions. In this paper, the different behaviour changes between respondents from
the two countries are examined, together with the correlation of the differences with either the
restrictions or with the socio-demographic of the respondents.

● RQ4 Does the population density influence the shopping behaviour?
One of the questions that arise when looking at behaviour is whether the built environment
represents an important influence. One of the research questions is therefore related to the
influence of the respondents’ residences and working environment on their behavioural change
and adoption during the first wave of the pandemic period.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 a literature review on COVID-19 and
online shopping behaviours is provided. Then it is followed by the methodology description in Section 3.
In Section 4, the results of survey data from the online questionnaire are presented, followed by
descriptive and multivariate analyses. The paper ends with discussion and conclusion sections.

2. Literature review
As COVID-19 has disrupted people's well-being and livelihood immensely, in the last few months there
have been enormous efforts within the scientific community, to not only seek the medical cure of the
disease but also to investigate how the disease has changed people's daily lives around the world. In
particular, related to transport, different studies have been carried out to characterize the pandemic period
in terms of i) changes in urban mobility and behaviour (Arimura et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Dahlberg
et al., 2020; De Vos, 2020, p. 19, 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Kavanagh et al., 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020;
Kunzmann, 2020; Layer et al., 2020; Nielsen et al., 2020; Parady et al., 2020; Pepe et al., 2020; Quilty et
al., 2020; Warren & Skillman, 2020, 2020), ii) impacts of lockdown strategies and social distancing (e.g.
Malik et al., 2020; Rahman et al., 2020), iii) changes in shopping activity (e.g. Hashem, 2020). Moreover,
there is also literature focusing on how to characterize the changes and what part of the population is
impacted the most (e.g. Jay et al., 2020; Laurencin & McClinton, 2020; Yechezkel et al., 2020).
According to Rahman et al. (2020), adopting strict lockdown measures (seen as an effective way to
maintain social distancing) significantly reduces overall mobility. The reduction is also associated with
socioeconomics and institutional factors, such as average age, level of globalization and employment in
service sectors (Rahman et al., 2020). Data from Google and Apple highlight that high-income countries
experienced the most reduction in mobility (Apple, 2020; Google, 2020; Lozzi et al., 2020). Globally,
public transport reached the lowest point of -76% in April, the drop reached -65% in driving and in
walking -67% in walking (Apple, 2020; Lozzi et al., 2020). In Sweden, there has been a 64% increase of
population in residential areas during working times, a decrease of maximum trip length of 38% and a
33% average decrease of daytime presence in industrial and commercial areas (Dahlberg et al., 2020). In
Italy, there has been a reduction of 50% of the total number of trips between provinces (Pepe et al., 2020).
Providing a full review is beyond the scope of this paper, instead, the authors provide a brief overview of
the main findings in terms of COVID-19 policies and the transition behaviour to online shopping
activities.

2.1 COVID-19 policies
Following the global outbreak of COVID-19 generated by the novel human Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at
the end of year 2019 and beginning of year 2020, countries across the world are taking measures in order
to reduce the spread of the virus, or at least to slow it down, in order to better cope with public health and
better manage its limited resources (Musselwhite et al., 2020; WHO, 2020). Human-to-human
transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating
its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces (Kampf et al., 2020). While knowledge about the
SARS-CoV-2 virus was limited at that time, many public health researchers had experiences with other
infectious diseases that have some similar characteristics.
To help countries navigate through these challenges, the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020)
provided operational planning guidelines in balancing the demands of responding directly to COVID-19
while maintaining essential health service delivery and mitigating the risk of system collapse. This
includes prioritising the continuity of essential services deliveries and making strategic shifts to ensure
that increasingly limited resources provide maximum benefit for the population, whenever is needed.
Whilst doing that, the travellers also need to comply with the highest standard in precautions, especially
in hygiene practices, and wearing personal protective equipment (WHO, 2020).
Whilst the prevention measures seem straightforward, for various other reasons, the implementation of
those measures have been varied across countries. For example, different countries have reacted
differently with various measures of social distancing which aim to prevent social contact and therefore
prevent the spread of the virus. Some (including Italy) have enforced a hard lockdown, while others
(including Sweden) have been less stringent (De Vos, 2020). The measures have been applied for different
periods of time and it is expected that new waves result in changes in the measures (De Vos, 2020). Sabat
et al. (2020) performed a study investigating the public sentiment towards the restrictive measures to
contrast COVID-19 spreading in seven European countries. They report a general trust of citizens for
their governments’ decisions and they also found higher worries in southern Europe than in the northern
parts.

2.2 Online shopping
The internet and communication technologies, in particular telecommuting and online shopping, have
been promoted as an alternative to work and shop from home. Before the pandemic, online shopping (also
referred to as e-commerce) is estimated to be about 20.7% of total retail sales in 2019 worldwide
(E-marketer, 2019). In Sweden, online shopping turnover is expected to grow by 33% during 2020
compared with 2019 (Gardshol, 2020). Moreover, during the second quarter of 2020 (which corresponds
to the period of this study), online shopping volume had a growth of 49%, and in particular grocery
shopping enjoyed a growth of 115% (Gardshol, 2020). In Italy, according to the Osservatorio Politecnico
di Milano-Netcomm, online shopping in 2020 will be worth 8% of total retail sales (Digital4, 2020). The
overall increase in Italy for 2020 is expected to be 26%, compared to the previous year, while the increase
in online grocery shopping during the first wave of the pandemic period and the coincidental lockdown
was 56% compared to 2019 (Digital4, 2020). In Italy, grocery stores and supermarkets experienced an
increase in revenue from online purchases of 300% during the first wave of the pandemic period (Lozzi et
al., 2020).
Different studies suggest that consumers’ online shopping and shopping travel behaviours are
significantly influenced by their socio-demographics, internet experience, car ownership, and
geographical factors (Brand et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2019). Shi et al. (2019) found that people who mostly
start their shopping trips from urban or exurban areas are likely to have a higher online shopping share. In
line with this, Saphores & Xu (2020) found that households in lower-density areas are less likely to order
goods online, compared to their counterparts (however, the ones who do shop online, have a larger
number of total deliveries). Whilst online shopping might be seen as a possible solution to mitigate urban
congestion, due to the substitution effect of online shopping on shopping trips, it might even increase
traffic (Bayarmaa & Susilo, 2014; Lee et al., 2017; Mokhtarian, 2002; Rotem-Mindali & Weltevreden,
2013, p.). Furthermore, previous studies have found that it is people who do not have a private car that are
more likely to substitute online shopping for shopping trips (Shi et al., 2019). Brand et al (2020)
explained that shoppers might be attracted to or repelled from online shopping for reasons of
convenience, perceived benefits, costs and risks, technology affection, time pressures and fit into daily
schedules (perceived behavioural control), as well as social and environmental dimensions of personal
norms and beliefs.
Online shopping behaviour changes over time in line with the acceptance of digital technologies (Sunio et
al., 2018) and with the change of one’s time use allocations and commitments over time (Schmid, 2019).
Saphores and Xu (2020), for example, demonstrate how age together with the level of education is
7

impacting the number of deliveries (younger generations and more educated people order more
deliveries). Hoogendoorn-Lanser et al. (2019) found that females shop online more compared to their
male counterparts, likely due to different in-home and out-of-home responsibility and activity
engagements.
COVID-19 related restrictions around the world have significantly reduced physical mobility, changed the
intra-households’ responsibility arrangement and subsequently the household members’ time-use
allocations, which in many ways have shifted the behaviour from physical to online shopping alternatives
(Hashem, 2020). The pandemic period also played an important role in improving the acceptance of new
technological solutions for the public (e.g. acceptance of autonomous delivery robots for receiving online
shopping deliveries) (Pani et al., 2020).
Whilst the shift of behaviours to online shopping is clear, and the evidence can be seen from the increase
of online retail sales recorded in the 2nd and 3rd Quarters of 2020, to the best of the authors’ knowledge,
there is not much attention given to understanding this shift at the individual level. Therefore, the main
scope of the study is to analyse the impacts of the first wave of the pandemic period restrictions to the
reported online shopping behaviour and how individuals from different socio-demographic groups behave
differently, given the virus containment strategy in the country, the type of the shopped goods, and the
geographical characteristics of the respondents’ place of residence.

3. Methodology
In the following subsections, first, the case study is defined: information on restrictive measures in place,
main social differences and digital maturity between the two analysed countries are provided. Secondly,
the methodology for data collection is included.

3.1 Studied areas: Italy and Sweden
Sweden and Italy are two counterparts in Europe in terms of prevention measures. To compare the
impacts of the first wave of the pandemic period and the adaptation behaviours in the two countries, it is
important to consider and account for the effects that the policies in place had on the population. In Table
1, the different social distancing measures taken by these two countries are described.

From 20th
April till
4th May

The country was in lockdown at the release of the
survey.
● schools and universities were closed,
● shops were closed (except grocery stores,
pharmacies, tobacconists, newsagents and
petrol stations),
● markets were closed,
● restaurants, pubs and cafes were closed (only
home delivery allowed),
● hair salons, beauticians and barbers were
closed,
● banks, post and public offices were open,
● parks had been closed,
● only specific kinds of physical activities outside
in constant motion were allowed (e.g. running,
jogging),
● all the factories in non-essentials sectors were
closed,
● it was forbidden to travel outside the
municipality of residence (except for certified
working reasons or serious health conditions).

From 4th
May till
18th May

The country started opening again from 4th May,
when it was allowed, while respecting social
distancing and using facemasks in public places:
● to travel in the region of residence for certified
reasons (e.g. work, health, visit relatives),
● to travel outside the region for certified reasons
(e.g. work, health, urgent matters, coming back
home),
● to access parks,
● to pick up take away food,
● to go back to work for workers in the
manufacturing and construction industry, as
well as real estate agents and wholesalers.

The following restrictions and guidelines were
in place:
● all restaurants, bars, cafés, school dining
halls and other venues serving food and
beverages had to ensure that tables were
spaced appropriately to avoid crowding and
customers had to be always seated when
consuming,
● it was prohibited to hold public gatherings
and public events for more than 50 people,
● pharmacies were not allowed to dispense
more medications than patients needed for a
three-month period,
● it was not possible to visit the national care
homes for the elderly,
● it was forbidden to leave home if
experiencing any flu-like symptoms (e.g.
coughing, cold, fever),
● it was recommended to work from home
whenever possible,
● it was strongly recommended to keep a
social distance of 2 meters between people
when possible.
Moreover, from April many companies started
a voluntary lockdown of their facilities.

Moreover, there are differences both in the economic and in the social structure of the two countries.
Table 2 shows the main social and economic characteristics of Italy and Sweden: population, density and
gender gap ranking1 are the most crucial differences, while in terms of employment rate and household
structure (average household size in the number of people) there is a less significant contrast.

According to Harvard Business Review, Sweden was significantly better prepared for the work from a
distance in terms of robustness of the digital platform compared to Italy (Chakravorti & Chaturvedi,
2020). According to the study, Sweden is the best positioned among European countries, in terms of
socially distant work. This refers to the robustness of the key digital platforms and the use of digital
money. On the other hand, Italy positions poorly among other European countries, being less resilient and
with not sufficiently robust platforms (Chakravorti & Chaturvedi, 2020). From Eurostat statistics in 2019,
it can also be seen the percentages of people that “usually” work from home, which is stated to be 3.6% in
Italy and 5.9% in Sweden (Eurostat, 2019). An even higher difference comes in the percentage of people
that “sometimes” work from home, which is stated to be 1.1% in Italy and 31.3% in Sweden (Eurostat,
2019).

3.2 Survey Description and Methodology
The methodology chosen in this paper to address the research questions is an empirical data collection,
focusing on behavioural changes before and during the first wave of the pandemic period. In this paper,
the analysis focuses on and explores the behavioural changes connected to shopping activities. Bin et al.
(2020) published in a separate work summarized results from the analysis regarding the trade-off
behaviours between virtual and physical activities. The responses analysed in this paper have been
collected from 20th April 2020 to 18th May 2020, but include only respondents that live either in Sweden
or Italy. To capture the early changes happening during the first wave of the pandemic period, the focus
was on getting fast responses. As there was no choice to be more selective in the recruitment process, the
survey was circulated through social media platforms and through the research centre network.

10

The survey has been made available in different languages (including Italian and Swedish), and it is
divided into six sections: i) change in travelling behaviour to perform daily activities (commuting, grocery
shopping, non-grocery shopping, order takeaway food, eat out, visit friends and family, go out for
entertainment/hobbies, physical activities); ii) change in internet usage (entertainment, personal call, work
or study, work or study meetings); iii) change in online shopping behaviour (grocery and non-grocery);
iv) perceived safety in performing daily activities (travelling by public transport, travelling by car, visiting
stores, being at the workplace or school, going to restaurants, pubs and cafés, going to the gym, spending
time outside, receiving home deliveries); v) intention of keeping the new habits (travel and commuting,
grocery and non-grocery shopping, work or study, handle meetings at work or school, free time, physical
activities) after the pandemic period; and vi) personal information (Bin et al., 2020). In the survey and
therefore in the paper, with the term online shopping the authors intend a purchase carried out through
online services, with home delivery or delivery at a pickup point (Hoogendoorn-Lanser et al., 2019;
Parady et al., 2020). For more information on the survey content, see Appendix I - Survey structure.
To address the objectives mentioned in the introductory section, a series of descriptive analyses are
provided. In the following section, i) the change in the proportion of online and physical shopping
behaviours between before and during the first wave of the pandemic period, ii) perceived safety during
the first wave of the pandemic period, and iii) likelihood of keeping the new habits after the pandemic
period is over are discussed descriptively. Then, to measure the impacts of individuals’
socio-demographic, built environment, and perceived safety systematically to different types of online
shopping behaviours, a series of linear and binary logistic regressions and multinomial logit models are
used.

4. Survey Result Description
The total number of answers collected throughout the month of survey development is 781. However, as
this study only focuses on respondents who live in Italy or Sweden, only 530 responses were used in the
analysis. An overview of the demographic distribution in the two countries is shown in Table 3.
Based on statistical data from SCB for Sweden (SCB, 2020) and Istat for Italy (Istat, 2020), in the survey
sample the percentage of males and females differs slightly from the general population. The reached
respondents have a higher education level and employment rate. It is important to highlight that the
majority of the Italian respondents live in the northern part of the country where the employment rate is
larger. Istat (2020) reports 66.2% of employment rate in the given region, which is very close to the
reported employment rate by the respondents. As for the comparison number from the Swedish side, the
unemployment rate in Sweden is 9.1% according to SCB (2020) and in Stockholm is 6.2% according to
the European Commission (European Commission, 2020). Lastly, it can be seen from the dataset that the
Italian respondents live in less dense areas when compared to their Swedish counterparts. This might
seem counterintuitive since the average density in Italy is 206 hab/km2 (Worldometer, 2020a) and in
Sweden it is 25 hab/km2 (Worldometer, 2020b). The reason for this discrepancy is due to how the samples
have been collected. In Sweden, the majority of the respondents come from Stockholm and Gothenburg,
which are the areas with the highest density in the country. Similarly in Italy, the majority of the
respondents come from the northern parts of the country which is also the highest density area in the
country.

In the paper, number of trips refers to trips to a physical store

14

In Figure 1, it can be seen that the number of trips2 for both grocery and non-grocery has decreased and
the percentage of online purchases has been increasing among the respondents from both Italy and
Sweden, comparing before and during the first wave of the pandemic period. Focusing on grocery related
purchases, it is possible to observe a smaller decrease in physical trips (especially in Sweden) when
compared to non-grocery shopping trips. In Italy the percentage of online grocery shopping (averaged
from all the respondents) has increased from 2% to 13%, while in Sweden it was already higher before the
pandemic period, and has barely doubled during the first wave of the pandemic period, shifting from 8%
to 15%. For non-grocery, trips have decreased more substantially especially in Italy. This could be also
due to the stricter policies in place in Italy, and to the fact that only a few non-grocery trips are considered
as essential and therefore are carried out despite the risk of visiting the shop. It can be also seen how in
Italy the increase in online shopping is greater when compared to Sweden.

a) Perceived safety of the respondents
while: travelling by car, travelling by
public transport, visiting stores and
receiving home deliveries. In the survey
the respondents had the option to choose
values between 1 (not safe at all) and 4
(very safe).

b) Likelihood of keeping the new habits
adopted during the first wave of the
pandemic period related to: travel and
commuting, grocery shopping and
non-grocery shopping. In the survey the
respondents had the option to choose
values between 1 (not likely) and 4 (very
likely).

15

In Italy, the perceived safety of doing activities connected to shopping (i.e. travelling by public transport,
travelling by car, visiting stores and receiving home deliveries) is lower than in Sweden (Figure 2a).
Moreover, the answers of the respondents regarding the likelihood of keeping the new habits connected to
shopping (i.e. travel and commuting, grocery and non-grocery shopping) are very similar between the two
countries (Figure 2b).

percentages are slightly lower, especially clothes. The only type of non-grocery item that is more
purchased by the respondents in Italy compared with their counterparts is work related. In general, hobby
related items are the most bought by the respondents.

5. Multivariate Analysis
In this section, a series of linear regression, binary logistic and multinomial logit analyses are presented.
First, the percentage of shopping that is performed online and the items that the respondents have
indicated to have bought during the first wave of the pandemic period are analysed through linear and
binary logistic regressions. Second, the results of four multinomial logit regressions are presented, two to
investigate how the respondents behave during the first wave of the pandemic period in terms of online
shopping and shopping trips, and another two to examine how the respondents have changed their
behaviour compared to before the pandemic.
In Tables 5 and 6, the variables in the rows show the independent variables, while in the columns there are
the dependent variables that have been tested. In Tables 8 and 10, the first column presents the
independent variables, while the other columns present the different groups in which the sample is
divided. B is the estimated unstandardized regression coefficient and t is the t-test statistics, indicating
16

either the significance of each independent variable to be correlated with the dependent variables (for
Tables 5 and 6) or the significance of each variable in influencing the belonging with the specific group
(for Tables 8 and 10). The variables that correlate at 95% confidence level are indicated by a star (*)
while the ones that correlate at 90% confidence level are indicated by two stars (**). Moreover, in Tables
8 and 10, the positive coefficients indicate a likelihood of a certain demographic characteristic (e.g.
Swedish residence) to be significant for the belonging with that group, while the negative coefficients
indicate the likelihood to be significant for the non-belonging with that group.

5.1 Online shopping change and non-grocery items selection
Table 5 shows a linear regression model with as dependent variables the differences (between during and
before the first wave of the pandemic period) in the percentage of shopping that is performed online.
People with a full time or part-time employment are positively correlated with a higher online shopping
for non-grocery items. Moreover, being highly educated is correlated (at 90% confidence level) with an
increase in online non-grocery shopping compared to their counterparts. On the other hand, being a
student is correlated (at 90% confidence level) with a smaller increase in online grocery shopping. The
household structure appears to be not significant in this analysis. Respondents who have reduced their
trips to non-grocery stores are associated with an increase in their online shopping for the same kind of
items. This is though not true for grocery: it appears that buying more groceries online during the first
wave of the pandemic period is not correlated with a reduction in grocery trips. The safety perception in
visiting stores is inversely related to the percentage of online grocery shopping one person has. This
suggests that the respondents who still feel safe while visiting stores are associated with a smaller
percentage of online purchases compared to respondents who feel less safe in stores. Finally, participants
living in more dense areas do more online shopping compared to people from less dense areas.

In Table 6, it can be seen that females in the sample are more likely to buy clothes during the first wave of
the pandemic period than their male counterparts; males instead are more likely to buy hobby related
items. Being a Swedish resident is correlated with buying clothes and, marginally (at 90% confidence
level) with buying houseware products. Italian respondents have a higher probability to buy work related
items compared to their Swedish counterparts. Students and workers bought more work related items,
while they bought less house or garden related items compared to their counterparts. Moreover,
respondents who reported to have elderly in their household also found to have a higher probability to buy
work related items. The density of population (calculated with respect to where the respondents live) was
found not significant in influencing the type of non-grocery items that the respondents bought during the
first wave of the pandemic period.

5.2 Respondents grouping based on shopping behaviour
To address to the research questions (especially first and second, regarding who has changed shopping
behaviour the most and the pandemic impact on social exclusion) and to analyse the phenomenon of
social exclusion and behavioural change systematically, the sample has been divided into different groups
according to two grouping methodologies, i.e.: one based on the absolute number of trips and the
percentage of online shopping made during the first wave of the pandemic period, and the other one based
on the differences in the respondents’ reactions (in terms of the number of physical trips and the
difference in online shopping) between during and before the first wave of the pandemic period. The next
two subsections explore these two grouping methodologies.
19

5.2.1 Activities during the first wave of the pandemic period
Table 7 presents the different groups in which the sample was divided for the analysis. Group 0 is the
reference group for the following multinomial logit regression analysis and it includes respondents that
did not travel (physically) for shopping purposes and did not buy online during the first lockdown period.
Looking at the demographic of this group, it can be seen that more than 80% of the respondents that fall
in this group are Italian. Group 1 represents respondents who are still visiting stores but are not using any
e-commerce services. Group 2 includes respondents who are not travelling to visit stores but they are
purchasing online. Finally, group 3 represents people that are still visiting stores but also using
e-commerce services.
Table 7 - Grouping methodology for a) grocery shopping and b) non-grocery shopping. The grouping
methodology in this case is related to behaviours of the respondents during the first wave of the pandemic
period. In brackets, the number of respondents per group.

# trips =0

Group 0 (90)

Group 2 (259)

# trips >0

Group 1 (31)

Group 3 (150)

The results of the multinomial logit model shown in Table 8a for grocery show that female respondents
are more likely to be part of group 1 or 3, which means they are more likely to visit grocery stores.
Moreover, living in Sweden is correlated with a higher likelihood to be part of group 2 or 1, which means
they either do only online or only physical grocery shopping. Finally, students are unlikely to be part of
group 3, people who feel safer in stores are likely to be in group 1 (at 90% confidence level), and
respondents living in dense areas are likely to be in group 3 (at 90% confidence level).
The results of the multinomial logit model shown in Table 8b for non-grocery shopping show that having
children in the household is correlated with being part of group 1, 2 and 3. Belonging to group 1 is
correlated with living in Sweden. It is also negatively correlated with having elderly in the household,
which is probably because the respondents fear infecting their older household members. It is also
negatively correlated with being a worker and a student. Being part of group 2 is correlated with being a
worker and with feeling safe in receiving home delivery (at 90% confidence level). Finally, belonging to
group 3 is correlated with being male, living in Sweden and feeling safe in receiving home deliveries.

5.2.2 Difference in behaviour between during and before the first wave of the pandemic
period
In this subsection, the focus is instead on the behavioural change: who has increased or decreased their
number of shopping trips and who has increased or decreased their online shopping. In the previous
subsection, the respondents have been grouped based on the number of their shopping trips and online
shopping percentage during the first wave of the pandemic period, whilst in this subsection, the
respondents have been grouped based on the change in behaviour compared to the period before the
pandemic.

22

Table 9 - Grouping methodology for a) grocery shopping and b) non-grocery shopping. The grouping
methodology in this case is related to the difference in behaviour between during and before the pandemic
period. In brackets, the number of respondents per group.

Table 9 shows the different groups in which the respondents have been divided for this second part of the
analysis. Group 0, which represents respondents that have reduced their online shopping regardless of the
difference in the number of physical trips, is relatively small (23 people for grocery and 35 people for
non-grocery shopping) and represents the reference group in the multinomial logit estimation. Group 2
represents the respondents that have not changed either of the behaviours, and it is one of the larger
groups when considering grocery shopping. Group 1 and group 4 represent respectively the respondents
who have not changed one of the two behaviours but have either decreased the number of trips or
increased their online shopping. Group 1 is the largest in both grocery and non-grocery shopping. Group 3
represents instead the respondents that have increased their online shopping and at the same time have
decreased the number of trips. Lastly, group 5 represents the respondents who had an increase in trip
difference, and either did not change their online shopping behaviour or increased their online shopping
during the first wave of the pandemic period: this group is also relatively small. The decision for
combining all the respondents with a decrease in online shopping for group 0 and with an increase in the
number of trips for group 5 is that otherwise groups with too few respondents would have been created.
The results of the multinomial logit estimation shown in Table 10a) for grocery show that respondents
without children in the household are more likely to belong to group 2, group 5, group 1 and group 3
respectively. Moreover, at 90% confidence level, respondents without elderly in the household are more
likely to belong to group 2. Swedish respondents and highly educated people are more likely to belong to
group 4.
23

The results of the multinomial logit estimation shown in Table 10b) for non-grocery show that workers
are more likely to belong, respectively, to group 3, group 4, group 2 and group 1. This correlation is the
only correlation which was found significant at 95% confidence level. Being highly educated is
negatively correlated with groups 1, 5, 2 (at 90% confidence level). Moreover, people that feel safe in
going to the stores are more likely to be part of group 2. These people probably did not change their
behaviour because they feel safe to still do part of their non-grocery shopping physically in the stores.

6. Discussion
RQ1 Who has changed the shopping behaviour the most?
From the overall results of the survey, an increase in online shopping and a decrease in the number of
physical shopping trips has been observed, as expected and in accordance with the literature presented
(e.g. Digital4, 2020; Gardshol, 2020; Hashem, 2020). Workers and highly educated people are shown to
have increased the most of their non-grocery online shopping behaviour (Table 5 and Table 8b), which is
in line with the previous findings (Hashem, 2020; Hoogendoorn-Lanser et al., 2019). On the other hand,
students are shown to have increased less their grocery shopping behaviour (Table 5). Overall,
respondents who indicated that feel unsafe in the stores are more likely to shop online, together with
people that live in most densely populated areas (Table 5). Moreover, respondents tend to reduce their
shopping trips due to online shopping, and this supports the claim that online shopping has a substitution
effect on the frequency of shopping trips in China (Shi et al., 2019).
When it comes to different purchased items, female respondents have a higher probability to buy clothes
than their male counterparts (Table 6). Moreover, females are also more likely to have kept the habit of
going to the stores for groceries, as it appears in the multinomial logit model (Table 8a). Unlike the result
shown in Hoogendorn-Lanser et al. (2019), Hashem (2020) and Saphores and Xu (2020), the analysis
does not show that females are associated with more online shopping (Table 5), neither for groceries nor
for non-groceries. Being a worker is correlated with more transitions towards buying more non-groceries
online, as shown in Table 10b, where it can be seen that workers mainly belong to group 3 (with an
increase in online shopping and a decrease in the number of trips). The result is also in line with Table 8b,
where it can be seen that workers mainly belong to group 2 and 3 (and therefore are actively shopping
online).
Regarding work related items, the household structure is relevant since respondents who reported to have
elderly within their household are more likely to buy more work related items: this could be a sign that,
given that the pandemic has a stronger influence on older people (CDC, 2020), also other people around
them take the necessary precautions to social distance themselves. Moreover, from Table 8b, households
without children have stopped going to the stores more compared to their counterparts. The fact that
households with children still shop for non-grocery items could be a sign that they regard non-grocery
shopping as essential. This is also in line with the National Retail Federation consumer view, that
confirms that children influence their parents’ shopping. The two top categories of influence are toys and
clothes (NRF, 2019).
26

RQ2 How do respondents adopt different shopping strategies during the first wave of the
pandemic period?
For grocery shopping, the group of people that stopped both types of activity (online and physical) is
extremely small in terms of size (Table 7a). Running demographic analysis on the group, it can be seen
how most of the respondents are Italian residents. These people (i.e. elderly, children, young adults) did
not buy groceries online nor in the physical store, therefore they might either need external help or have
other members of the household in charge of buying essential items for them. It can also be seen how
respondents that feel safe in the stores are more likely to belong to group 1 (at 90% confidence level),
where the only way of shopping is going to the physical store. For non-grocery shopping, the group of
people that stopped both types of activity is double in terms of size (Table 7b) compared with the grocery
shopping one (Table 7a). This could simply be related to different people’s perception of what types of
shopping is essential. Moreover, the feeling of safety in receiving home deliveries is a determining factor
in the decision of the respondents to shop online.

RQ3 What are the main differences between Italy and Sweden?
Due to the stricter restrictions in Italy compared to Sweden (Table 1), Italian respondents have shown to
have reduced the number of trips more when compared to their swedish counterparts (Figure 1). An
increase in online shopping has also been observed for both countries, as expected from literature
(Digital4, 2020; Gardshol, 2020): in Italy the results show a higher increase during the first wave of the
pandemic period when compared to before the pandemic. Two factors play a role in the higher online
shopping: i) in Sweden there were less stringent restrictions in place (Table 1), and residents were always
allowed to visit physical stores; ii) the already higher (when compared to Italy) figures in online shopping
purchases (Digital4, 2020; Gardshol, 2020). Being a Swedish resident is correlated with being part of
group 1 and 3 (Table 8b), who still choose to go to the physical store. This is in line with the
considerations on policies in Sweden (Table 1).
In Italy, the respondents showed to buy more work related items compared to their swedish counterparts
(Table 4 and 6): as Harvard Business Review points out, the population was not ready to work from a
distance (Chakravorti & Chaturvedi, 2020), and therefore had a need to purchase items related to work.
Another important statistic that is worth mentioning is how many people are used to work from home,
which from Eurostat amounts to 37.2% in Sweden and only 4.7% in Italy (Eurostat, 2019). When the
lockdown period started in Italy, a new regulatory framework for remote work was implemented in May
2020 (Ministero del Lavoro e delle Politiche Sociali, 2020). In Italy, there has been a hesitation towards
remote working, associated with a resistance to allow employees to work independently, without the
potential constant supervision that there would be in a regular office space (Betti, 2020).
27

RQ4 Does the population density influence the shopping behaviour?
The density of population is significant only in online shopping: participants living in denser areas are
more engaged in online shopping activities compared to their counterparts (Table 5). In all other analyses,
the density was found not significant, which is unique compared to previous evidence on the impacts of
geographical locations to the propensity of doing online shopping (Saphores & Xu, 2020; Shi et al.,
2019). The fact that for the remaining analysis density is not relevant could be biased by the size of the
sample, to the nature of the pandemic-driven lockdown being deployed, and the fact that in the sample the
average density for both Swedish and Italian respondents is higher than the average density in Sweden
and Italy respectively.

Caveats
As discussed in Section 4, the survey sample has a higher education level and a lower unemployment rate
than the corresponding averaged national statistics. This, that might be due to the way the respondents
have been recruited, results in a bias since the sample does not represent the national population.
Moreover, most of the Italian respondents come from northern Italy and most of the Swedish respondents
come from either Stockholm or Gothenburg. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. In
the analysis, the authors did not distinguish between sub-periods correlated with different policies in
place, which could have an effect on the respondents’ answers.

7. Conclusion
Based on 530 responses from an online survey, this study investigates the impacts of the first wave of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the behavioural transition from physical to online shopping. The descriptive
results and multivariate analyses have been used to explore who have changed the shopping behaviour the
most, how respondents have adopted different strategies, what the main differences between Italy and
Sweden are and the influence of population density on the behavioural change. The study suggests that
Italian residence is positively correlated with a larger increase in online shopping and a bigger reduction
in physical trips when compared to their Swedish counterpart, in line with the reflections on differences in
policies and the online shopping behaviour prior to the pandemic.

28

The main takeaways are the following:
1. In Italy, the respondents are more likely to buy work related items compared to their Swedish
counterparts. This is presumably because, prior to the pandemic period, many Italian employees
were not ready to work remotely and therefore many respondents were in need to buy work
related items. Since, different policies have been implemented in Italy during the first wave of the
pandemic period, to help workers adapt to the new working situation.
2. Previous literature shows a correlation between the population density and the probability of
people adopting online shopping. This study does not support this correlation for most of the
changes: the only behaviour that has a correlation with the density of population is the increase in
the percentage of online shopping (i.e. living in denser areas is correlated with a higher
engagement in online shopping activities). For the other activities, the respondents did not have a
choice but were either enforced or recommended to act in certain ways by the policies in place.
3. The analysis shows that the respondents were impacted differently in terms of trips. Some
respondents unconsciously excluded themselves from doing certain activities, since they reported
not to do any grocery nor non-grocery shopping during the first wave of the pandemic period. The
results also show that the group of respondents who did not shop for non-grocery items is larger
than the group that do not shop for grocery items, which highlights the discrepancies of types of
shopping the respondents may consider as essential.
4. The household structure of the respondents impacted their behaviour in different ways. Having
elderlies in the household impacted the precautions that the members of the household took,
including being prepared to work remotely and avoiding going to the physical store to buy
non-grocery items. In this sense, the households with elderlies can also be categorised as a risk
group who may end up being socially excluded, a group of population which have not been the
focus of the current support policies. On the other hand, having children in the household is
correlated with still visiting the non-grocery physical stores.
In summary, the results highlight the differences between the two study areas (i.e. Sweden and Italy) in
terms of social distancing measures, social structures and technology readiness. These confirm the need
for different policy strategies to help different groups of citizens comply with pandemic related measures,
whilst still being able to fulfill their individual shopping needs (which are highly influenced by their
socio-demographic characteristics, technology readiness, and household composition). The study also
shows that different socio-demographic and household structures matter in determining the directions of
the shopping behaviour transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic period.
