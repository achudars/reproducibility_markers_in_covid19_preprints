Abstract
OBJECTIVES: Estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0 ) of COVID-19 vary across countries.
This paper aims to characterise the spatial variability in R0 across the first six months of the global COVID19 outbreak, and to explore social factors that impact R0 estimates at national and regional level.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, LitCOVID and the WHO COVID-19 database from January to June
2020. Peer-reviewed English-language papers were included that provided R0 estimates. For each study, the
value of the estimate, country under study and publication month were extracted. The median R0 value
was calculated per country, and the median and variance were calculated per region. For each country, the
Human Development Index (HDI), Sustainable Mobility Index (SMI), median age, population density and
development status were obtained from external sources.
RESULTS: A total of 81 studies were included in the analysis. These studies provided at least one
estimate of R0 , along with sufficient methodology to explain how the value was calculated. Values of R0
ranged between 0.48 and 14.8, and between 0.48 and 6.7 when excluding outliers.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the estimates of the basic
reproduction number of COVID-19 globally and highlights the spatial heterogeneity in R0 . The value was
generally higher in more developed countries, and countries with an older population or more sustainable
mobility. Countries with higher population density had lower R0 estimates. For most regions, variability in
R0 spiked initially before reducing and stabilising as more estimates became available.

Introduction

In 2020, the world observed the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was of an unprecedented nature. The
World Health Organisation released a statement on 9 January 20201 reporting that a novel respiratory disease
had been identified by Chinese authorities, originating in Wuhan. This disease was identified as 2019-nCov
in early January, and spread rapidly outside of Wuhan and into the rest of the world. By 17 January, China
recorded 62 cases, and 3 travelers had exported the disease, with two diagnosed in Thailand and one in Japan
[1]. At the time of writing, 220 countries have been affected by the disease, with the total death toll estimated
at over 1 500 0002 . This highlights the importance of understanding all aspects of the disease in order to combat
it effectively.
The basic reproduction number (R0 ) is of particular importance in epidemiological modelling [2]. This is
the average number of susceptible individuals that are infected by a single infected individual [3]. It is best
measured in the early phase of the outbreak, before control measures have had time to take effect, and when
most of the population is susceptible. Estimation of R0 has proved complex [4]. R0 estimation depends on the
extent to which the disease characteristics are understood, which is challenging in the case of a novel disease.
Assumptions must also be made about the ways in which people come into contact with one another. These
assumptions and uncertainties limit the precision and accuracy of models used to determine R0 . Previous
reviews have determined that values of the estimate range between 0.6 and 14.8 [5, 6]. The reviews of [7] and
[8] determined R0 to be between 1 and 7, while [9, 10, 11] found R0 estimates to be between 2 and 4. The
review of [12] states that estimates appear to be stabilising between 2 and 3. It should be noted that these R0
estimates were all determined at the beginning of the pandemic, and do not reflect changes in the disease over
time.
Reasons for the great variability in R0 estimates remain an open question. The review of [8] indicated that
mathematical models and stochastic models gave different values for R0 , however, [10] stated that heterogeneity
in the estimates was not influenced by the estimation methods chosen. The data used to estimate R0 introduces
another source of variability. This is supported by the review of [11], which states that R0 varies from place to
place, but does not describe the variation. While comprehensive, none of the above reviews investigated how
the estimates of R0 differ across countries or regions.
This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the estimates of the basic reproduction
number of COVID-19 globally and to highlight the spatial heterogeneity in the estimates over the first half of
2020. As R0 is measured at the beginning of the pandemic, changing R0 values do not reflect the progress of
the disease, but instead illustrate a growing understanding of the disease characteristics over time. We further
investigate possible factors that influence this spatial variability, namely their economic development status
as classified by the World Bank, their human development index (HDI) as an indicator of social development,
social mobility index (SMI) as a measure of mobility, median age and population density. Finally, an illustrative
example considering a model specific to South Africa is given to guide the discussion on spatial heterogeneity
in R0 .

Materials and Methods

Inclusion criteria
Only English peer-reviewed research papers were included. These had to provide an estimate of R0 , and had
to provide enough information in the methodology to determine how R0 was calculated. Reviews, conference
papers and other sources were not considered directly in our review, but were consulted as secondary sources.

Search strategy
The search included papers published between 31 December 2019 and 30 June 2020, allowing for the initial stages
of the disease spreading internationally. The WHO COVID-19 database, PubMed and LitCovid were searched
for English-language papers including the terms “Coronavirus”, “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, or “2019-nCoV”
in combination with the phrases “reproduction number” or “reproductive number”. Two reviewers (RT and NA)
independently evaluated the eligibility of the studies obtained from the literature searches. All articles yielded
by the database searches were screened by their titles and abstracts to obtain studies that met the inclusion
criteria. After this, full-text screening was performed. In cases of uncertainties, agreement was reached through
a third reviewer (IFR).

Data extraction
Data extracted included the country for which R0 was estimated, whether actual data or simulated data was
used, the value of R0 as well as its 95% confidence interval and whether a spatial component was considered
in the estimation of R0 . Data was extracted independently by two reviewers (RT and NA) and in the case of
no consensus, IFR was consulted. Risk of bias was not considered in this study because no meta-analysis was
done.

Ethics statement
This study was a systematic review which did not employ any human or animal subjects.

Results

Description of included articles
Figure 1 shows the review process. A total of 592 documents were found by searching PubMed, LitCOVID and
the WHO COVID-19 database up to 30 June. In total, 425 were screened after removing duplicates, pre-prints
and non-English articles. Of these, 81 were included in the study (Supplementary File 1). These contained
sufficient methodology to calculate the basic reproduction number, as well as a numerical estimate for R0 . For
each paper, the estimated values of R0 were included, along with the country (countries) under study, the
areas within countries where applicable, and the publication month. The studies covered 65 countries across 5
continents, as shown in Figure 2.
Estimates for the basic reproduction number were given both at a national level and at local levels. The
estimates for local areas were calculated independently and did not consider spatial auto-correlation between
the regions. China had the most overall estimates at 100, followed by Italy with 91 and the USA with 61,
thanks largely to the paper of [14], which provided R0 estimates for each state of the USA. The paper of [15]
contributed to the large number of R0 estimates for India, namely 27 estimates. Spain recorded the fifth largest
number of estimates, namely 12. These estimates came from a greater variety of papers. The countries which
recorded the highest number of national R0 estimates were Italy with 17 estimates, China with 15, Japan with
11 and Spain with 10 national R0 estimates. A total of 36 countries only recorded one national R0 estimate
each.
Since the focus herein is on spatial variation in R0 , we do not consider the estimation techniques. However,
we note the most popular approaches observed in the study. SEIR-like compartmental models were used in
two thirds (54) of the included papers, 15 papers employed exponential or logistic growth models, while the
methods of [16] and [17] were used in 9 and 6 papers respectively. We refer to the review of [8] for a thorough
investigation of the effects of estimation techniques on the R0 estimate.

Figure 3: Distribution of R0 values by publication month.

Variability in R0 observed in the reviews
Monthly distribution of R0 value
Figure 3 shows the shift in R0 estimates, both national and local, by publication month. For each month, the
median was calculated based on all the papers that had been published up to and including that month. This
does not indicate a change in the R0 value over time, as most of the R0 estimates were calculated based on
data from the beginning of the pandemic. Rather, this reflects a change in the understanding of the disease
over time. This may be due to various factors, such as more sophisticated estimation techniques or improving
epidemiological knowledge. The estimates published in January and February were all obtained for China, and
follow a similar pattern, being between 2 and 4. The estimates in January were all local, in particular calculated
for Wuhan. For February, it should be noted that an estimate of size 14.8 for the Diamond Princess cruise ship
is not visualised here, as it was removed from the analysis as an outlier. In March, estimates from the rest of the
world became available, including Italy and Japan. A large amount of variability was experienced for this month.
In April, 20 countries had estimates. Both local and national estimates evidenced a bi-modal distribution, with
the greater mass concentrated between 1 and 3. The smaller concentration of mass, between 4 and 6, is largely
due to the local estimates for the United States from the paper of [14]. In May, the pattern shifted, with smaller
R0 estimates generally. Very few estimates were obtained above 4. By June, most estimates were between 1
and 2.5. The higher estimates were all obtained at a national level, with the top five recorded for Brazil, India,
China, Spain, the UK and France. The histogram of all R0 values is shown in Figure S1, exhibiting a bi-modal
distribution similar to the patterns in Figure 3, with the greatest concentration of values between 1.5 and 3, and
the second smaller mass between 4 and 6, mostly influenced by the local estimates published by [14] in April.
National distribution of R0 value
Figure 4 shows the median R0 per country. As of June, most of the estimates were between 1 and 4, with only
the USA (median R0 =4.78) and Spain (median R0 =4.25) being over 4. Only two were below 1, namely Hong
Kong (median R0 =0.61) and Singapore (median R0 =0.7). Variance could not be measured at a national level
due to the small number of estimates for many countries. Of the 65 countries, 36 had only one estimate available
per country. The fact that many of these countries were included at all is largely due to the contribution of
[18], who provided R0 estimates for 53 countries.

Figure 4: National R0 medians as of June 2020.

Figure 5: Regional R0 medians as of June 2020.
Regional distribution of R0 value
To investigate variability, the countries were aggregated, as variance can not be reliably calculated for the 36
countries with only one estimate. The countries were grouped into regions as defined by the World Bank3 . The
groupings are shown in Table S1.
The regional median estimates are displayed on the map in Figure 5, while Figure 6 shows the change in
regional medians by publication month of the estimates. The medians and standard deviations are cumulative,
meaning they are based on all the estimates up to the relevant month. There is an initial increase for the East
Asia & Pacific region, from 2.65 in February (based on 2 estimates) to 3.19 in March. From March it decreases
steadily to 1.77 in June. Similarly, the median decreases for all regions as shown in Figure 6, except for North
America and South Asia. For these regions, the median R0 increased. It is worth noting that neither of these
regions had many estimates in earlier months. As of June, the region with the highest median estimate is North
America at R0 =4.28, and the lowest median is obtained for South Asia at R0 =1.47. This places the R0 estimate
firmly above 1.
The bands in Figure 6 show 10% of the standard deviation, providing a visual representation of the variability
per region. The 10% is chosen for visual clarity, as showing the full standard deviation would cause the bands
to overlap to the point of illegibility. The standard deviation increased in the East Asia & Pacific region from

February to March. This is due to the fact that only two estimates were available in February, namely 2.1 and
3.19, both from the same paper [19]. By April, many more papers had been published, necessarily leading to
a larger variance. By May, estimates began to stabilise, thereby reducing the variance. This general trend was
observed for all regions for which more than two months were available, where an initial spike in the variance
was observed for the second month, reducing in the third. For South Asia, only two months are available. It is
therefore expected that the variance will decrease after June. As of June, the smallest variance was obtained for
the Middle East & North Africa region at 1.29 and the largest variance was obtained for Sub-Saharan Africa at
5.43. The variance also displays two distinct regional groups. The first experiences lower variance throughout,
and includes Europe & Central Asia, Middle East & North Africa and South Asia. The second group exhibits
higher variance, and consists of East Asia & Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, and North America.
A large number of estimates was recorded for both Italy and China. China has a big influence on its region,
as the median for East Asia & Pacific drops from 1.77 to 1.52 when excluding China, and the variance drops
from 4.46 to 1.59. Italy, however, does not have such a big influence on its region. Excluding Italy, the median
and variance for Europe & Central Asia are 2.67 and 2.01, respectively, as opposed to 2.8 and 1.85.
Social factors that affect the variability of R0
From the previous section, it is clear that the value of R0 differs across countries and regions. Since the R0
value was estimated at the beginning of the pandemic, this is not a result of varying laws or non-pharmaceutical
interventions in the face of the pandemic, but rather some factors related to the ordinary state of affairs in a
country prior to lockdown. A brief analysis is conducted to explore how R0 varies based on social or mobility
factors.
The United Nations Human Development Index4 (HDI) is considered to measure social development, along
with the Sum4All Sustainable Mobility Index5 (SMI) as a transport index. The HDI measures the quality of life
of a country’s population. It considers the length and health of citizens’ lives, their education and knowledge,
and standard of living. It is easily interpretable and data is collected yearly, therefore the 2019 HDI was used
herein. The SMI is a multi-faceted metric which measures how well a country is performing in terms of achieving
sustainable transport for the future. It takes into account rural access, urban access, equality in the treatment
of male and female users of the transport system, efficiency, safety, as well as air pollution and GHG emissions.
The data for nearly all countries globally is publicly available on the Sum4All website. Countries were grouped
into developing economies or transitioning/developed economies as classified by the UN [20].
Based on the R0 values in the study, R0 is not strongly correlated with HDI (ρ = 0.21), SMI (ρ = 0.24),
median age (ρ = 0.08), or population density (ρ = −0.28), indicating no linear relationships. Additionally,
these variables are correlated with each other. This makes multivariate regression infeasible, however, trends
in the data may be studied visually. Figure 7 shows these patterns in the data. No high R0 values were
obtained for countries with low HDI, SMI or median age, or a high population density. Based on the available
data, variation in R0 increases as HDI, SMI and age increase, and decreases as population density increases,
in perhaps a non-linear way. The boxplots show that the median R0 is similar for developing versus developed
countries, however the spread of values is negatively skewed for developing countries and positively skewed for
developed countries. Additionally, the variability is higher for developed countries. When considering median
age, a roughly symmetrical distribution was experienced for countries with a younger population, while the

experienced more variability than the former.

Illustrative example for South Africa
South Africa’s first case of COVID-19 was announced on 5 March 2020. The government took a swift risk averse
approach placing the country in full lockdown due to high levels of co-morbidity in the population and concerns
regarding hospital preparedness. We illustrate spatial variability of R0 in South Africa as a special case of the
variability observed in the systematic review to further guide the discussion of this paper.
Values of R0 in South Africa
There are three main approaches for estimating R0 [21], namely, using a mathematical expression of the parameters for contact amongst the population; using data of cases over time; or using expressions based on the
values estimated from the endemic equilibrium of infection. An R package R0 [22] is also available to estimate
the parameter for epidemic outbreaks, depending on data one has available.
In South Africa, the National Institute For Communicable Diseases (NICD) has estimated R0 (as well as
the effective reproduction number) [23]. They used the maximum likelihood method of [24] and the first 15 –
19 days of the epidemic in South Africa to estimate R0 . The main effect was due to international travellers
entering South Africa at the start of the epidemic. Table 1 provides the estimates of [23] for the most affected
regions. The variability of the values indicates a non-homogeneous spreading of COVID-19 within South Africa.
Accounting for spatial heterogeneity is therefore critical when modelling COVID-19 transmission, and R0 in
particular.

ward level as per the 2016 census.
Sensitivity analysis of spatial R0
In order to demonstrate the importance of the spatial component, we conduct a local sensitivity analysis using a
SEIR model for the COVID-19 cases in South Africa. We consider the sensitivity of the proportion of individuals
that had been infected by the end of 201 days to the spatial6 R0 . R0 was sampled from a Uniform(1,5)7
distribution over 960 simulations8 , and the correlation between the R0 and proportion of infected individuals
was calculated. Figure 8 illustrates the results of this spatial sensitivity analysis visualised as correlations.
The figure illustrates that many correlations are between 0.8 and 0.9, indicating a strong relationship between
the spatial R0 and the proportion of infected individuals. The figure further demonstrates that the strength of
this relationship varies across geographical space. This necessitates the use of a spatially varying R0 to model
COVID-19. Future work aims to provide such a spatial SEIR model for South Africa.

Discussion

This study provided a comprehensive review of initial R0 estimates of COVID-19, as modelled at the beginning
of the pandemic in each country. The changes in the published estimates over the first half of 2020 displayed
a growing understanding of the R0 value in the modelling community. R0 values were visualised at a national
and regional level to investigate the spatial heterogeneity evident in the estimates. The relationship between
R0 and various social factors were visualised and described, and it was found that a higher R0 value was related
to higher values of HDI, SMI, and median age, and a lower population density. An illustrative example of
COVID-19 modelling in South Africa highlighted the importance and the challenges of accounting for spatial
heterogeneity when estimating R0 .
The study included 81 papers and covered 65 countries. The countries with the highest number of estimates,
local as well as national, were China and Italy. The highest national R0 medians were recorded in the USA
(median R0 =4.78) and Spain (median R0 =4.25). The USA is well connected to other countries, including
China, along direct flight routes and other channels of transport. This may have led to a higher influx of
infected individuals before travel restrictions were put in place. A study by [25] suggests that while the initial
Spanish case was imported from Germany in late January, numerous cases were received from Italy through
February before local infections began to rise by the end of February. Italy also recorded high estimates (median
R0 =3.14). As it was one of the first countries to experience the pandemic, recording the second largest outbreak
in March [26], the country had little time to make preparations. This includes unofficial decisions by individuals
to take preventative measures such as self-isolation and social distancing. While the values in this review were

mostly estimated prior to official non-pharmaceutical interventions, citizens of countries that had more warning
may have practised social distancing, self-isolation, and increased sanitising prior to official regulations. The
value for Italy can therefore be seen as the most representative value of the basic reproduction number of
COVID-19 in an uncontrolled environment. Aside from the USA and Spain, the only countries with a higher
median R0 than Italy were Germany (median R0 =3.37) and South Africa (median R0 =3.26).
The highest individual value of R0 was 14.8 for the Diamond Princess cruise ship. This number may not be
representative of COVID-19 transmission, as the disease spread rapidly in the confined conditions of the cruise
ship. The influence of super-spreaders would also have been exacerbated by these conditions. Recent studies
suggest that super-spreaders are responsible for the majority of infections [27, 28].
The lowest median R0 values were recorded for Hong Kong (median R0 =0.61) and Singapore (median
R0 =0.7), the most densely-populated countries in the study. Both countries have a history of managing pandemics, so that unofficial non-pharmaceutical control measures, such as mask-wearing, may have been in place
before official COVID-19 regulations were implemented. The lowest median R0 values above 1 were recorded
for Uruguay (median R0 =1.03), Romania (median R0 =1.04) and Saudi Arabia (median R0 =1.09). Note that
a low R0 does not necessarily mean fewer infections, since a low estimated R0 might also be due to a lack of
testing or unreliable case data. R0 is usually estimated from the number of confirmed cases, which can be a
direct result of a country’s testing strategy.
At a regional level, the highest regional median was recorded for North America (median R0 =4.28), while
South Asia obtained the lowest median (median R0 =1.47). The median shows an increasing trend, with higher
estimates for June than for May. This does not necessarily imply that the estimate will continue to rise. Most
regions experienced a sharp decline in median R0 from the first to the second month of estimation, with a
slight increase into the third month. This indicates an initial overestimation by modellers, followed by an overcorrection, finally stabilising to a slightly higher value that is nonetheless much lower than initial estimates.
The exceptions to this trend were East Asia & Pacific, which experienced a sharp peak before a decline, and
North America, which increased steadily to a regional median of 4.28. It is worth noting that neither of these
two regions had a large number of estimates. It is therefore possible that the median R0 may decrease as more
estimates become available, following the pattern of the East Asia & Pacific Region. All other regional medians
stabilised, showing a growing consensus among researchers that the R0 value of COVID-19 is between 1 and 3.
Patterns in the variance differed by region. East Asia & Pacific had a low initial variance, calculated on
two estimates for China in February. This increased slightly into March, spiked to a value of nearly 8 in April,
then decreased sharply in May and more gradually in June. For the Middle East & North Africa, Europe &
Central Asia, and North America, the variance in the published estimates showed a spike in uncertainty from
April to May followed by stabilisation in June. Sub-Saharan Africa followed a similar trend, experiencing a
greater decrease from May to June. The above mentioned regions all follow a similar pattern to East Asia &
Pacific, lagged by two months. This may be due to later outbreak dates. Latin America & Caribbean shows a
sharp decrease from the initially high variance (close to 7) in April, to a variance below 5 in May, and a slower
decrease in June. This follows precisely the trend in East Asia & Pacific, not lagged. The variance for South
Asia increased sharply from May to June. Based on the trends of the other regions, we may expect this variance
to decrease in July.
The impact of various social and demographic factors on R0 was studied. In particular, the HDI and
development level were used as indicators of socio-economic development, while the SMI indicated the level of
development of the transport network of each country. The median age and population density were considered
as demographic factors. While no linear relationships were found between R0 and any of these factors, clear
patterns were visible. In general, there were no high median R0 values for countries with low measures of social
development and infrastructure, i.e. a developing economy, low HDI or low SMI. It should be noted that most
estimates were obtained using the data of reported cases. In the case of developing countries, a substantial
portion of the population may not have access to testing facilities due to lack of infrastructure, leading to fewer
cases being detected. No countries with younger populations had high median R0 values. In contrast, no low
median R0 values were recorded for countries with a high population density. Additionally, the data showed
that the variability in R0 depended on the value of these factors. Variability and hence uncertainty in R0
increases with age, HDI and SMI, and decreases with population density.
The South African example illustrates the necessity of accounting for spatial heterogeneity when modelling
R0 , while highlighting the difficulty of modelling R0 in real-time. The R0 values estimated by the NICD illustrate
that the spread of COVID-19 varies by geographical region within South Africa. This supports the findings of
the literature review that R0 varies spatially. The sensitivity analysis further demonstrated a spatially varying
relationship between R0 and the proportion of infected individuals, with differing correlations observed per
ward. Accounting for spatial variation in R0 is crucial for modelling the spread of COVID-19. This must
however be done with caution, as adding a spatial component to a model will increase complexity and may
increase uncertainty. A thorough understanding of the ways in which R0 varies spatially is therefore required.
This study provides a critical stepping stone towards such an understanding.
As more data becomes available, future work should incorporate R0 literature of later months, including the
10

rest of 2020 and beyond. In addition, this would allow further modelling to better quantify the relationship of
R0 to the social and demographic factors. The date of the initial outbreak per country could also be included,
as well as unofficial social prevention measures put in place by citizens prior to official lockdown, as these may
affect the value of R0 . Estimation techniques could also be considered, as in the review of [8]. Since R0 is
heavily reliant on the testing strategy of a country, testing statistics per country may also be included, subject
to data availability. Lastly, the methodology of this study could be extended to investigate spatial variation of
the time-varying reproduction number.

Conclusion

This systematic review presented a summary of the R0 estimates of COVID-19 across the first six months of the
pandemic, indicating a changing understanding of the disease characteristics. Spatial variation in the estimates
was presented at a national and regional level. In addition, the study explored the relationships between R0 and
development and SMI. Countries with a lower level of development, a younger population, a lower sustainable
mobility score or a higher population density did not record high R0 values. The example for South Africa
demonstrated the necessity of introducing a spatial component into transmission modelling. This study provides
a vital step towards characterising spatial variation in R0 . A deeper understanding of the factors that influence
the spread of COVID-19 is critical for combating this disease which has disrupted so many lives across the
globe.
