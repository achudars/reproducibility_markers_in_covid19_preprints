model and machine learning technics for forecasting
Babacar Mbaye Ndiaye, Lena Tendeng, Diaraf Seck
Abstract. This work is a trial in which we propose SIR model and machine learning tools to analyze the coronavirus pandemic in the real
world. Based on the public data from [3], we estimate main key pandemic parameters and make predictions on the inflection point and possible ending time for the real world and specifically for Senegal. The
coronavirus disease 2019, by World Health Organization, rapidly spread
out in the whole China and then in the whole world. Under optimistic
estimation, the pandemic in some countries will end soon, while for most
part of countries in the world (US, Italy, etc.), the hit of anti-pandemic
will be no later than the end of April.
Keywords. coronavirus, COVID-19, pandemic, SIR model, stochastic,
machine learning, forecasting.

1. Introduction
The pandemic of COVID-19 was firstly reported in Wuhan in December 2019
and then quickly spread out international wide, see Figure 1.
Since some decades ago mathematical community and specialists in computer
sciences investigate biological questions to propose models describing subjects
such as diseases, physiological phenomena. One of these models are formulated with the help of Differential Equations (SIR models, reaction diffusions
equations, etc.) while others use computer sciences (see [20, 13, 8, 7, 5]).
In this work, for the mathematical modeling part, we are going to use the
SIR model without demography because the lifespan of the disease which is
an influenza disease will be very short compared to the lifespan of humans
(even if the flu lasted 2 years which would be exceptional, 2 years do not
represent much compared to the average longevity of a man). Similarly for
This work was completed with the support of the NLAGA project.

this type of disease it is also assumed that there will be no significant renewal
of the population while it is raging. The last influenzas that seriously affected
humanity did not last long (H1N1 for example) even if this new virus hitherto
seriously defies science.
Our aims are first, to collect carefully the pandemic data from the [3], e.g.
https://www.tableau.com/covid-19-coronavirus-data-resources, from
January 21, 2020 to April 02, 2020. In the second step, we propose two technics, a SIR model and machine learning tools, to analyze the coronavirus
pandemic in the worldwide.

The article is organized as follows. In the section 2, we present some auxiliary
results of the SIR model (model, estimation of parameters) and the machine
learning technics for forecasting, followed by the simulations and results in
section 3. Finally, in the section 4, we present conclusions and perspectives.

2. Methodology
2.1. SIR model
In this work, we use the classical Kermack-Mckendrick SIR model to describe
the transmission of the COVID-19 virus pandemic[9, 10]. The SIR model
is a compartmental model for modeling how a disease spreads through a
population. Its an acronym for Susceptible, Infected, Recovered. The total
population is assumed to be constant and divided into three classes.
In this model, naturel death and birth rate are not considered because the
outstanding period of the disease is much shorter than the lifetime of the

• S is the number of individuals susceptible to be infected at time t.
• I is the number of both asymtotimatic and symptomatic infected individuals at time t.
• R is the number of recovered persons at time t.
• The parameters β and γ are the transmission rate through exposure of
the disease and the rate of recovering.
Fore more details about SIR, see [22].
2.2. Estimation of parameters
Parameters identification methods fall into two broad categories: parametric and non-parametric. The aim of non-parametric methods is to determine
models by direct technics, without establishing a class of models a priori.
They are called nonparametric because they do not involve a vector of parameters to be sought to represent the model.
Parametric methods are based on model structures chosen a priori and parameterized. In this case, the goal is to find a vector of parameters θ, which
will make it possible to obtain a model representing the behavior as close as
possible to the real system. The search for the best model becomes a problem
of estimating θ.
Parameter identification belongs to the topic of inverse problems[11, 19, 21].
It is widely studied and there is an abundant literature. But the subject is
still interesting and there are still open problems. There are numerous approaches for the estimation of parameters. In this paper, we shall give a brief
overview and quote the least square method. For details and the discovery of
other methods see for instance [21].
If we look at the problem in general first, we have data yi , i = 1, ..., n where
each yi was measured at a specific ti point; on the other hand, we have a
model, i.e. a function f depending on time on the one hand and on the
other hand a set of parameters that will be noted P = (p1 , p2 , ..., pk ). It is
assumed that the amount (scalar or vector) that is tracked is described by
q(t) = f (t, p1 , p2 , ..., pk ) that is noted by f (t, P ). We do not know the value

4

Babacar et al.

of pj , j = 1, ..., k but with measurement errors, we must have the relationship
yi = f (ti , P ),

i = 1, ..., n

and then that yi is the measure of q(ti ).
The idea is therefore to look for all the values p1 , p2 , ..., pk , which, in a sense,
makes the differences yi − f (ti , P ) as close as possible to 0 for all i = 1, ..., n
simultaneously.
One natural method is the least square one, by setting

E(P ) =
[yi − f (ti , P )]2

to be minimized on a subset S of Rk . This set may be open of closed. Even
it is quite possible to study cases where Euclidean metric is replace by a
Riemannian one usually noted g.
Remark 2.1. To estimate parameters, it is possible to use the observer theory
by first ensuring that the model is well observable and identifiable.
2.3. Existence
First let us remind that the minimization problems in the previous section
are very classical in the cases we shall consider. That is why, we do not emphasize on the theoretical aspects.
For the SIR model, it is also classical to have existence and uniqueness whenever convenient Cauchy data are considered. The Cauchy Lipschitz theorem
ensure existence and uniqueness of local solution. And even the recovery theorem is equivalent to Cauchy Lipschitz theorem.
2.4. Forecasting using Prophet
Machine learning technics for forecasting is a branch of computer science
where algorithms learn from data. Algorithms can include artificial neural
networks, deep learning, association rules, decision trees, reinforcement learning and bayesian networks [1, 2, 12].
Forecasting involves taking models fit on historical data and using them to
predict future observations. We use this technic for the COVID-19 prediction
in the real world.
We use Prophet [15, 18], a procedure for forecasting time series data based
on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and
daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have
strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers
well.
For the average method, the forecasts of all future values are equal to the average (or mean) of the historical data. If we let the historical data be denoted
by y1 , ..., yT , then we can write the forecasts as
ŷT +h|T = ȳ = (y1 + y2 + ... + yT )/T

Analysis of the COVID-19 by SIR model and forecasting

5

The notation ŷT +h|T is a short-hand for the estimate of yT +h based on the
data y1 , ..., yT .
A prediction interval gives an interval within which we expect yt to lie with
a specified probability. For example, assuming that the forecast errors are
normally distributed, a 95% prediction interval for the h-step forecast is
ŷT +h|T ± 1.96σˆh
where σh is an estimate of the standard deviation of the h-step forecast distribution.
We perform one week ahead forecast with Prophet, with 97% prediction intervals (multiplier=2.17). Here, no tweaking of seasonality-related parameters
and additional regressors are performed.
For the data preparation, when we are forecasting at country level, for small
values (Senegal for example), it is possible for forecasts to become negative.
To counter this, we round negative values to zero.

3. Numerical simulations and results
In this section, we present the simulations of SIR model and the forecating
technic for the prediction of the pandemic.
The numerical tests were performed by using the Python with panda [16].
The numerical experiments were executed on a computer intel(R) Core-i7
CPU 2.60GHz, 24.0Gb of RAM, under UNIX system.
3.1. Data analysis
As cited in the introduction, the simulations are carried out from data in [3]
(https://www.tableau.com/covid-19-coronavirus-data-resources), from
January 21, 2020 to April 02, 2020. According to this daily reports, we first
analyse and make some data preprocessing before simulations. The cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths cases are illustrated in Figure 3
and Figure 4 (curve and histogram).

3.2. SIR model
We use the SIR model simulations for the Senegal case study. For the initial
values, well use normalized population values for our S0 , R0 , etc. So if we
assume we have 10k people in our population, and we begin with four exposed
person and the remaining susceptible, we have: N = 10k (a sample), I0 =
4, R0 = 0, S0 = N − I0 − R0 .
For the contact rate (β) and the mean recovery rate (γ), we have: β = 0.25
and γ = 1/30 (in 1/days). Susceptible people in blue curve remain constant

for less than twenty days which could correspond to the incubation periode
of the disease.

After the day 20, there is a rapid decrease in the blue curve which show the
fast transmission of COVID-19.
Infected people in red line appear right after day 20. Where the red curve
and blue curve cross, at about day 40, is the first day where more people are
in the infected compartement than the susceptible one.
The peak of infected people is reached at day 40 approximately with 6000
infected persons (60% of infected persons). The model predicts a significant
number of recoverers so few deaths due to the disesase.
3.3. Forecast for the pandemic of COVID-19
Here, we perform predictions for the worldwide (180 countries, from January
21, 2020 to April 02, 2020) and four selected countries China, Italy, Iran and
Senegal. Most importantly, with the model and parameters in hand, we can

Under optimistic estimation, the pandemic in some countries (like China)
will end soon within few weeks, while for most part of countries in the world
(Italy, Iran and Senegal), the hit of anti-pandemic will be no later than the
end of April.
We can summarize our basic predictions as follows, for the worldwide and by
country:
• For the worldwide, (see Figure 6 and Figure 7), overall, except in a
period, the validation data show a well agreement with our forecast
and all fall into the 97% confidence interval (shaded area). We see the
number of cases is almost equal to our predictions, showing each country
of the whole world must take strict measures to stop the pandemic. At
∼April 07, 2020 we may obtain > 1 million 200,000 confirmed cases (see
Table 1).
• For China (see Figure 8), based on optimistic estimation, the pandemic
of COVID-19 would soon be ended within few weeks in China.
• For Italy (see Figure 9) and Iran (see Figure 10), the success of antipandemic will be no later than the middle of Avril. The situation in
Italy and Iran are still very severe. We expect it will end up at the
beginning of May.
• For Senegal (see Figure 11), we don’t have enough data, because the first
case appear in the beginning of March. And we are delighted to see cases
are lower than our predictions, showing the nation wide anti-pandemic
measures in Senegal come into play.
Remark 3.1. In Figure 6 to 11, the dots (color black) are the real data, the
blue line is ŷ, the shaded area represents the confidence interval (97%).

Finally, due to the inclusion of suspected cases with clinical diagnosis into
confirmed cases (quarantined cases), we can see severe situation in some cities,
which requires much closer attention.

4. Conclusion and perspectives
In this article, we propose the generalized SIR model and forecasting (machine learning) to analysis the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The authors think that the part of identification could be deepen. Indeed, one way
should be to to consider in general the identification of systems. It is the operation of determining the dynamic model of a process (system) from input /
output measurements. Knowledge of the dynamic model is necessary for the
design and implementation of an efficient regulatory system.
In other words, the identification of a real dynamical system (called object) is

Analysis of the COVID-19 by SIR model and forecasting

11

to characterize another system (called model), starting from the experimental
knowledge of the inputs and outputs so as to obtain an identity of behavior. In practice, the purpose of identification is generally to determine the
conduct model, which can be used to simulate, control or regulate a process.
This model can be physical (in the sense of analog or digital simulator and
reduced model), or an abstract model (mathematical model, i.e. system of
algebraic or differential equations (ODE or PDE)). Finally, note that some
addressed questions in parameter identification are the recognizing of sets
(domains, curves, etc.).
Finally, note that some addressed questions in parameter identification are
the recognition of sets (domains, curves, etc.). And a final remark is the identification of geodesics: In almost every epidemic, there is a phenomenon of
super-propagation (super spreader)- when a person transmits an infection to
a large number of people. And super spreader phenomena may appear. The
role of super-spreaders it is the fact, noticed by Erds [4], that in a random
graph there is always a small number of very connected people, through which
almost all geodesics pass. How could it be possible to identify these facts in
this pandemic?
The stochastic aspect would be very interesting because we are not even sure
to have for the case of Senegal all the data. In addition there are infected people who do not develop the disease and spread it (the case of some children as
it seems) not to mention the case of asymptomatics that are not monitored
and are the cause of community transmission. There is also the probability
of touching an infected object: too much hazard in the transmission of the
disease. Let us propose among many possibilities the following stochastic SIR
model:
 dS

 dt = −βIS + σ1 dW1


dI
(4.1)
dt = βIS − γI + σ2 dW2

 dR
dt = γI
• S is the number of individuals susceptible to be infected at time t.
• I is the number of both asymtotimatic and symptomatic infected individuals at time t.
• R is the number of recovered persons at time t.
• The parameters β and γ are the transmission rate through exposure of
the disease and the rate of recovering.
• σ1 and σ2 are volatility rates that may depend on the time t, the suspects
and the infected. W1 and W2 are classical Brownian motions.
For this model, the complete theoretical study could be an interesting part
such as existence and uniqueness results and qualitative properties. Let us
quote for the readers that there is a Cauchy Lipschitz Theorem for (4.1), see
for example [6].
Remark 4.1. We would like to underline that the case of Senegal must be
deepen in the sense that there are not yet enough data. And it should be

better to look for getting more data and even consider a stochastic model to
take into account the difficulties that can be met in the information system
to collect enough data.
