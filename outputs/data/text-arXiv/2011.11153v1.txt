Abstract
Since May 2020, several COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in the German meat
industry despite various protective measures, and temperature and ventilation
conditions were considered as possible high-risk factors. This cross-sectional study
examined meat and poultry plants to examine possible risk factors.
Companies completed a self-administered questionnaire on the work environment
and protective measures taken to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable
logistic regression analysis adjusted for the possibility to distance at least 1.5
meters, break rules, and employment status was performed to identify risk factors
associated with COVID-19 cases.
Twenty-two meat and poultry plants with 19,072 employees participated. The
prevalence of COVID-19 in the seven plants with more than 10 cases was 12.1%
1

and was highest in the deboning and meat cutting area with 16.1%. A subsample
analysis where information on maximal ventilation rate per employee was available
revealed an effect for ventilation rate (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.996, 95% CI
0.993-0.999). When including temperature as an interaction term in the working
area, the effect of the ventilation rate did not change. Increasing room
temperatures resulted in a lower chance of obtaining a positive COVID-19 test
result (AOR 0.90 95% CI 0.82-0.99), and a 0.1% greater chance of a positive
COVID-19 test for the interaction term (AOR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.003).
Our results further indicate that climate conditions and low outdoor air flow are
factors that can promote the spread of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols. A possible
requirement for pandemic mitigation strategies in industrial workplace settings is to
increase the ventilation rate.

Introduction
Numerous COVID-19 outbreaks, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-2), in several meat processing plants around the globe have been
described [1,2,3]. In Germany alone, the media reported approximately 3,654
positive SARS-CoV-2 tests (in the following also denoted as COVID-19 cases) in
meat processing plants, and public health authorities reported 2,819 positive cases
tested

among

to

the

Berufsgenossenschaft Nahrungsmittel und Gastgewerbe (BGN; English: German
Social Accident Insurance Institution for the foodstuff and catering industry; current
as of 28.8.2020).
On 16 April 2020, the German Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs issued a
recommendation for working during the pandemic. This SARS-CoV-2 occupational
safety standard made clear COVID-19 prevention recommendations on distance,
2

face coverings, personal protective equipment, cleaning, and hand hygiene
measures. However, there have still been at least 16 outbreaks so far in which at
least 10 workers per meat processing plant tested positive in a meat processing
company. The larger outbreaks had implications for entire communities, as
interventions were implemented to contain the spread [4]. At first, employee
accommodation (temporary housing for these primarily contract workers) in the
meat industry were suspected as a possible distribution factor for SARS-CoV-2 [5]
and seem to correlate positively with the infection figures [6]. However, living
together and going to work together does not seem to be the sole explanation,
which is why working conditions have increasingly been considered as a relevant
risk factor.
Slaughterhouses and meat processing plants are characterized by particular
working conditions. For food safety reasons some areas maintain a low ambient
temperature [7] (REGULATION (EC) No 853/2004), which may result in better
survival of SARS-CoV-2 at lower temperatures compared to room temperature
[8,9,10]. Results from cross-sectional studies sometimes imply an association
between COVID-19 infection and temperature and humidity [11,12,13], but one
study did not find an association [14]. In addition, work areas requiring strenuous
manual labor mean employees have an increased breathing rate and volume, and
noisy work areas necessitate loud speech for communication [7]. As a result, an
employee infected with SARS-CoV-2 will produce numerous SARS-CoV-2 aerosols
[15,16,17]. Once released into the air, they remain in the environment for different
durations depending on the ventilation, which provides fresh air and dilutes the
concentration of airborne contagions [17,18,19]. The extent of this air exchange
appears to affect the distribution of aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 [17,19], which
are suspected of being the main vector for COVID-19 infections in the meat
3

industry [7]. The air exchange in rooms with a ventilation system is realized by
moving outdoor air inside the building with the possible addition of circulating air
flow. Some meat industry tasks require working with little distance between
employees for entire shifts, for example in the meat processing and in the
packaging area [5].
The dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet well understood. First studies have
observed more infections in meat industry areas where distances between
employees of less than two meters is the norm [20], but distances of up to 8 meters
could also play a role [6]. In view of this research gap, we want to explore the
impact of these particular working conditions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. From
the previous literature, we therefore derived the following hypotheses:
1. Higher infection rates in employees are observed in work areas with low
temperatures.
2. In work areas with lower air flow (fresh air supply) per employee, higher
infection rates in employees are observed more often than in work areas
with higher air flow per employee.
3. In work areas where a minimum distance of 1.5 meters cannot be
maintained, higher infection rates in employees are observed than in work
areas meeting this minimum distance requirement.
4. The effect of the outdoor air flow per employee is amplified in cooled work
areas, which is why we expect a multiplicative interaction effect.

Methods
Setting, participants, and study design
In a cross-sectional study, twenty-six companies were contacted by BGN
Prevention Management with a cover letter containing information on the study and
4

a request to complete a questionnaire about protective measures against new
infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. 17 companies had known infections and 9 had
none in the period from the end of June to the beginning of September 2020.
Previously designated contacts at each site received the paper-and-pencil
questionnaire per email and were asked to provide information about the
employees, working conditions, and organization measures to prevent the spread
of COVID-19 for the work areas in their establishments. They were asked to return
the questionnaire within one week.
In addition to the questionnaire, the objectively measurable parameters on the
ventilation technology in cooled areas of the plants with many infected employees
are collected on-site. So far, this has already been done in two companies.

Questionnaire
The questionnaire was designed based on the specific features of the
slaughterhouses and the meat processing industry suspected of being related to
infection occurrence (distance between employees, temperature and ventilation
conditions). In the meat industry, individual work areas within a company
fundamentally differ from each other depending on the process stages to be
carried out. The differentiation of the work areas follows the logical production
sequence of animal processing, right up to the packaged food.
Information on separate work areas as well as the company in general was
collected. These included questions about the number of employees, employment
relationship types, the general housing and transport situation, especially for
particularly at-risk workers (temporary/contract workers), the types of face
coverings used, and other questions on infection protection within the framework of
the current SARS-CoV-2 occupational safety standards (e.g. time shift,
5

occupational health organization, preventive measurement promoting social
distancing).

Operationalization
The number of temporary and contract workers was determined by subtracting the
permanent staff from the total number of employees. Similarly, the number of
infected temporary and contract workers was calculated by subtracting the infected
permanent workers from infected workers in total. The point prevalence is given as
the percentage of workers who had reported a positive test for COVID-19 to their
employer by a certain point in time, or as the number of diseased workers per 100
workers. The prevalence is calculated separately for all employees as well as for
permanent or temporary staff.
In terms of infection, plants were classified into the categories of no infections (0
infected), a few infected employees (1-10 infected), and many infected employees
(>10 infected). The type of breaks taken during work were categorized as: breaks
taken freely, fixed breaks with time shift, and fixed breaks without time shift.
The ventilation rate (hereinafter outdoor air flow (OAF)) on its own, is not sufficient
for analysis. A high OAF value does not necessarily translate into a high amount of
fresh air per employee. The absolute value is furthermore strongly influenced by
the size of the room. Therefore, we made two assumptions in order to be able to
include this value in the evaluations:
1. To evaluate the amount of outdoor air in m3/h as a measure to prevent the
spread of SARS-CoV-2, the OAF is divided by the number of employees in a work
area.

6

2. If the employees work in shifts in a work area, only the employees who work
during the same shift are in this work area at a time, so we divide the number of
employees in a work area by the number of shifts.
This resulted in the following formula for the OAF per employee in a work area:
𝑶𝒖𝒕𝒅𝒐𝒐𝒓 𝒂𝒊𝒓 𝒇𝒍𝒐𝒘 𝒑𝒆𝒓 𝒆𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒐𝒚𝒆𝒆 𝒊𝒏 𝒂 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒂𝒓𝒆𝒂
=

𝑶𝒖𝒕𝒅𝒐𝒐𝒓 𝒂𝒊𝒓 𝒇𝒍𝒐𝒘 𝒊𝒏 𝐦𝟑/𝐡
𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒆𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒐𝒚𝒆𝒆𝒔 𝒊𝒏 𝒂 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒂𝒓𝒆𝒂
𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒔𝒉𝒊𝒇𝒕𝒔 𝒊𝒏 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒂𝒓𝒆𝒂

The room temperature was given in degrees Celsius and was also included in the
evaluation as an interval scaled variable.

Statistical analysis
Data entry, cleaning, and evaluation were performed using SAS 9.4 and IBM SPSS
Statistics Version 25. Participants were included in the main analysis if they were
working in a plant with at least 10 employees who had been infected with SARSCoV-2 at the time of the questionnaire. Working characteristics of the study
subjects were expressed by mean values for continuous variables and by relative
and absolute frequencies for discrete variables. Beside the range of prevalence’s
in the participating plants, results and information about individual companies are
not presented.
Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to study the association
between the reported COVID-19 infection of an employee as the outcome variable
and the explaining working factors. Therefore, we report the crude odds ratios (OR)
and an adjusted model including the following independent exposure variables: (1)
comply with the minimum distance of 1.5 meters as a dummy variable; (2) room
temperature in degrees Celsius; (3) having a ventilation system as a dummy
variable; (4) type of work break as an ordinal variable and (5) type of contractual
7

relationship with the company as a dummy variable. Additional analyses were
carried out using data for all employees for whom we had information on OAF. In a
next step, we also excluded the first processing steps due to the use of carbon
dioxide to stun some animals (e.g. pigs) in the slaughter area. These areas have a
process related high ventilation rate. Therefore, the relationship between infection
and OAF could be biased in these areas. In this final analysis, we changed variable
(3) to OAF per employee in a work area and introduced a multiplicative interaction
term for temperature and OAF per employee in a work area. To better assess the
connection between OAF per employee and the risk of developing COVID-19, subanalyses were calculated with 1, 10 and 100 m3/h per employee. During the on-site
visits, it became apparent that air-conditioning had subsequently been installed in a
meat processing area after the superspreading event. Therefore, we excluded
workers from this work area in this plant from the ventilation sub-analysis.
Missing temperature information was replaced in the non-cooled work areas by the
assumption of a seasonally slightly increased room temperature of 22°C. All other
missing values were included in tables of the descriptive analyses as an additional
category for the respective variable (n, %).

Results
Of the 22 participating companies, information was collected for 19,072 employees,
including 880 infected workers (S 1 Table). Infected workers screened before
entering the plant are not reported. One plant had 356 infected workers,
representing 40.5% of all infected workers in our study.
Our study includes seven plants with many infected workers, with a prevalence
between 2.94 (95% CI 2.22-3.87) to 35.10 (95% CI 29.40-41.27) infections per 100
employees. A total of 856 infected individuals were counted in these plants (Table
8

1). Five plants had fewer than 10 infected individuals, and ten plants (one plant
took part although it was not contacted) had none. Plants in the low-infection
category had an average prevalence of 0.6%, and plants with many infected
workers had an average prevalence of 10.98%. The seven plants with many
infected workers were in six cases slaughterhouses and/or meat processing
facilities and one plant for meat and sausage production. Two out of the six
slaughterhouses and meat processing facilities also had small divisions specialized
for meat and sausage production.
In total, 7,798 employees of the sample worked in the plants with many infected
employees. 949 (12.2%) workers had missing information on the distance variable.
An additional 83 subjects from cooled areas (1.1% (overall 562 subjects, 7.2%))
were excluded from the analysis because they had missing information on the
temperature and 244 subjects (3.1% (overall 1044 subjects, 13.39%)) were
excluded from the analysis because they had missing information on the kind of
work break, resulting in 6,522 employees eligible for the main analysis. Of these
employees, we collected information on the air flow volume per employee for 2,786
employees (35.7%), who were eligible for sub-analysis. Nearly 73% of the study
population was temporary workers. All working characteristics for the study sample
are presented in Table 1.

The temperatures across work areas differ in our sample due to the different
hygienic requirements and processing steps (Tables 1 and 2). Deboning and
cutting area, meat and sausage production, packaging, and commissioning must
always be cooled. In our sample, these work areas have, on average, a
significantly lower temperature (3.9°C - 8.9°C) than all other work areas (13.5°C 22°C). Overall, 78.9% of the employees had to work in areas where the
temperature is below 12°C and, for technical reasons, for 60.2% of the employees
the minimum distance of at least 1.5 m cannot be guaranteed (Table 1). Most of
these are working in the deboning and meat cutting area (Table 2). In addition to
the type of cooling, it was also of interest to examine the extent to which the air
conditioning systems are attached to an outdoor air supply. The values for OAF
vary on average between 450 m3/h in the workshop and up to 51,470 m3/h in the
delivery. If the values for OAF are converted to a person level, the delivery is
20,176 m3/h, the anesthesia/slinging/hanging is 1,885 m3/h, the slaughtering is 731
m3/h, and the commissioning is 727 m3/h, which lie clearly above the values of the
other working areas.

Table 3 shows the results of multivariable logistic regression analysis for having a
positive COVID-19 test. Univariate analysis revealed a 71% greater chance of
testing positive (OR 1.71; 95% CI 1.42-2.06) if the employee had a temporary
contract rather than a permanent contract. But these differences disappeared when
adjusted for the covariates. Across all models, employees who work where a
minimum distance of less than 1.5 m between workers was the norm had a higher
chance of testing positive (AOR 1.86; 95% CI 1.55-2.22). Having a ventilation
system reduced the chance of testing positive and was lowest in the unadjusted
model of the sub-group with only temporary workers (OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.21-0.43).
Workers in workplaces with higher room temperatures also had a lower chance of
testing positive (AOR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96-0.99). This relationship was greater
among contract workers compared to temporary workers. Workplaces where
breaks could be taken as suited (AOR 0.37; 95% CI 0.20-0.70) and workplaces
where fixed breaks were not shifted over time (AOR 0.22; 95% CI 0.17-0.28) had a
lower risk of testing positive than workers with fixed breaks shifted over time.

The subsample analysis including information on maximal OAF per employee
revealed an effect for OAF when the delivery, stunning/slinging/hanging, and
slaughter areas were excluded from the analysis (AOR 0.996 95% CI 0.993-0.999)
(Table 4). When including an interaction term for temperature and OAF, the
chances of testing positive for CVOID-19 in higher-temperature rooms became
lower (AOR 0.90 95% CI 0.82-0.99). The effect of OAF became also lower (AOR
0.984; 95% CI 0.971-0.996), and a 0.1% greater chance of testing positive for
COIVID-19 developed for the interaction term (AOR 1.001 95% CI 1.000-1.003).

Sub-analysis
To assess the connection between OAF per employee and the risk of COVID-19
infection, sub-analyses were calculated with 1, 10 and 100 m3/h per employee (S 2
Table). The chance of developing COVID-19 decreases in all analyzes from 1 m3/h
when considering 10 m3/h and 100 m3/h. In the model with the interaction term, this
means an AOR of 0.190 (95% CI 0.055-0.659) for OAF per employee of additional
100 m3/h and an AOR of 1.143 (95% CI 1.011-1.294) with the interaction term.
During on-site visits, we learned that an air-conditioning installation had
subsequently been installed in a meat processing area. Excluding the workers from
this work area in this plant from the final analysis hardly changed the results (AOR
OAF per employee 0.983, 95% CI 0.969-0.997; AOR temperature 0.933, 95% CI
0.837-1. 039; interaction term 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.003; n =1,702.).

Discussion
Key results
The aim of the study was to identify risk factors for COVID-19 among meat industry
workers. Participating companies provided information on 19,072 employees in the
twelve predefined work areas plus others, if present, to look at the association
between COVID-19 and workplace conditions. The study shows that workers in
areas with lower temperature have higher chances of contracting COVID-19;
workers with higher OAF per employee have lower chances. These effects persist
even after the introduction of an interaction term and are further reinforced by this.
Maintaining a distance of at least 1.5 m is only possible in some work areas
(approx. 40%). The dismantling and packaging work areas seem to neglect this
important safety measure frequently. However, an association between social

17

distance not being maintained and the chance of infection was observed across all
work areas.

Strengths
One strength of the present study is that all plants with a known superspreading
event were contacted by the BGN. Although working conditions were self-reported,
we were able to visit two plants on-site. Both visits mostly confirmed the answers
given by the companies and our assumption about the actual number of potentially
exposed subjects during a shift. In both plants, the collection of the room
temperature confirms the information from the questionnaire. Additional information
will soon be available for humidity and carbon dioxide concentration in the work
areas.
The study design allowed for an investigation of the relationships between COVID19 cases and the working conditions through cross-sectional data for different
plants. In addition, the effect estimates were adjusted for important confounders, so
that the observed effects of OAF per employee, temperature and social distance
are largely unbiased.

Limitations
Some limitations must be considered in our study: While creating the
questionnaire, it was a challenge to summarize the operational conditions at the
workplace so that these parameters could be solicited in a standardized manner. In
addition to the existing heterogeneity of the work areas of slaughterhouses and
meat processing plants, as well as businesses for meat and sausage production,
delimiting the work areas is not always clear. For example, there was a company in

18

which processing meat was carried out together with the packaging of the meat in
one hall.
Companies could only provide information on COVID-19 cases where employees
reported their company on a voluntary basis that they were positive. These
numbers were mostly in line with reported figures from the press or figures sent to
the BGN by the health authorities.
In addition, the complexity of different ventilation and cooling systems in the meat
industry needed to be addressed with rather general questions. Therefore, the
technical parameters considered here are not enough to describe the cooling and
air conditioning systems. In many cases, the interrogated companies rely on the
manufacturer's information for these parameters, which must be inquired about in
detail and which mostly relate to maximum performance values. Depending on
performance levels and production requirements, these maximum values can
deviate from the actual values within the respective work areas.
In addition, the meat processing industry was aware of the dangers and the
associated damage (financial and ideological) of a COVID-19 outbreak. Each
company tried to remove or deactivate potential viruses from the air using the
SARS-CoV-2 occupational safety standards and additional measures (filtration
using HEPA filters or UVC radiation). Companies affected by an outbreak were
forced to establish additional measures and hygiene concepts in order to restart
production. In addition, the type of cooling, and the presence of air circulation and
additional air purification present before the outbreaks could bias the results
towards the null. In a next step, we will analyze the data with genuine information
on the temporal effects of the relationship between the outdoor air flow, additional
air purification and the risk of infection.

19

Interpretation
The prevalence of COVID-19 in the participating companies with the highest
superspreading events in Germany was 12.1%. However, it must be borne in mind
that the company with the largest superspreading event - described in Gühnter et
al. [6] - is not included in the results.
Based on the available results, it is possible to confirm the assumptions in the
literature and our hypotheses that the interaction of these factors can explain the
globally observed COVID-19 outbreaks in the meat and poultry industry [5,6,7].
By far the most affected work area was the deboning and meat processing area,
which is characterized by problematic workplace conditions, including low
temperature, low air exchange rates, and lack of social distancing between
workers.
The main analysis showed that employees working in an area with a ventilation
system had a lower chance of becoming COVID-19. As suspected, it could be
shown that very high levels of OAF per employee are achieved during slaughter,
which biases the relationship between OAF per employee and COVID-19 towards
the null. In the analysis with OAF, it was shown that with higher OAF per employee,
employees had a smaller chance of becoming COVID-19 and an inverse
relationship between temperature and infection.
The results for the different break times are unexpected, as one would assume that
a temporal shift leads to smaller groups and thus a lower infection risk. The results
may be explained by an unmeasured factor though, such as the canteen size and
its ventilation.
Other factors that we were unable to consider for survey reasons are the wearing
of face covering and the accommodation and the transportation mode to work of
the temporary workers. The extent to which face coverings were worn was
20

collected in the questionnaire, but since a face covering was required almost
everywhere after the pandemic began, we decided to exclude this variable from the
model. Data were collected on accommodation and transportation to work of
temporary workers, but these were not available at the work area level.
In order to better assess our OAF values, we looked for ways to match them with
official recommendations. According to the workplace ordinance for indoor spaces
(ASR A3.6), depending on the activity of the employees or their level of activity, an
indoor air quality considered beneficial is achieved if the concentration of exhaled
carbon dioxide (Pettenkofer number) does not exceed a value of 1000 ppm. With a
Pettenkofer value of 1000 ppm, this corresponds to an outdoor air flow per person
and per hour of 81m³/h during heavy physical activity. The recurrent emergence of
such outbreaks suggests that the Pettenkofer value should be kept as far below
1000 ppm as possible, which increases the necessary outdoor air flow per
person[21]. In our analysis and in the two on-site visits, the problematic areas are
mainly the deboning and meat cutting, meat production, and packaging areas,
which did not fulfill the recommended outdoor air flow.

Generalizability
In conclusion, this study indicates that there are multiple risk factors for the
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the work environments of meat and poultry
processing companies. The different ventilation and temperature conditions
suggest that each outbreak may develop differently. Both, the different courses of
the outbreaks and the heterogeneity of the company’s specialization and structural
conditions make it difficult to make general statements about the infection
occurrence in the meat industry. However, our results illustrate the benefit of
preventive measures and the need to further investigate the ventilation conditions
21

on-site. In any case, the amount of OAF per hour per person should be determined
as the target value for air exchange. This seems even more important when
considering the interaction with temperature.
To what extent the results can be transferred to private living spaces, offices or
classrooms seems questionable. These settings work with intensive ventilation for
a short time period for a virus dilution in the air of the rooms, contrary to the
permanent ventilation in the meat industry.
The significance of this study is imminent for the meat and poultry processing
industry but should also play a role in other food processing industries, distribution
centers and other workplaces where employees work under similar conditions
[2,22]. It points to the importance of air quality and air flow in confined spaces as a
valuable additional measure to prevent future superspreading events.

Acknowledgements
This collection of information and analysis would not have been possible without
the willingness and interest of the companies and a trusting cooperation with the
BGN; the study contributes to a further expansion of this good dialogue process.
Therefore, we want to thank all participating plants. We would also like to thank
Prof. Thomas Behrens (IPA), who read the manuscript critically and supported us
with helpful insights and Ludger Stennes (BGN), who collected the data and helped
with insights to the meat processing.
