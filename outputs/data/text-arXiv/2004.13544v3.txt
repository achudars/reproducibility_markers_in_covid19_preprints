ABSTRACT
Objectives. Public health officials need tools to assist with anticipating the healthcare resources
required to confront the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. We built a modeling tool to aid practicing
public health officials with estimating healthcare demand from the pandemic in their
jurisdictions and to evaluate the potential impacts of population-wide social-distancing
interventions.
Methods. The tool uses a SEIR compartmental model to project the pandemic’s local spread.
Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate.
Outputs include the number of infections and deaths with and without intervention, and the
demand for hospital and critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity. We
illustrate the tool using data from three regions of Chile.
Results. Our scenarios indicate a surge in COVID-19 patients could overwhelm Chilean
hospitals by June, peaking in July or August at 6 to 50 times the current supply of beds and
ventilators. A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home quarantine, social
distancing of individuals >70 years, and telework interventions may keep treatment demand
below capacity.
Conclusions. Aggressive interventions can avert substantial morbidity and mortality from
COVID-19. Our tool permits rapid evaluation of locally-applicable policy scenarios and updating
of results as new data become available.

1. Introduction
On December 31, 2019, the regional office of the World Health Organization (WHO) was
notified of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin associated with a market in Wuhan,
China (Zhu et al., 2020). A novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) was identified as the cause of the
infections (Zhu et al., 2020) and has since spread worldwide. As of May 7, 2020, more than 3.6
million cases of COVID-19 (illness caused by SARS-COV-2) have been reported in 184
countries and territories, including ~250,000 deaths (Dong et al., 2020, World Health
Organization, 2020). The pandemic has overwhelmed both national and local healthcare capacity
in several countries (Ferguson et al., 2020, Kissler et al., 2020), and is projected to do so in many
others. Low- and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable (Walker et al., 2020), since
financial and logistical challenges may hinder their ability to augment treatment capacity. As
such, many countries have resorted to societal-wide social distancing interventions in the hopes
of reducing morbidity and delaying the demand for healthcare resources, in order to gain time to
increase treatment capacity.
Numerous modeling efforts have forecasted the spread of the outbreak and examined the
potential benefits of social-distancing interventions (Ferguson et al., 2020, Flaxman et al., 2020,
Kissler et al., 2020, Walker et al., 2020). While informative, these efforts have been limited to
specific nations and snapshots in time and public health officials are reliant on the authors for
updated estimates as the pandemic evolves. Other internet-based tools offer public health users
the ability to generate estimates on their own, but these are limited in their practical utility
because their assumptions and desired results may not match the specific needs of jurisdictions
and public health decision makers, or they require coding knowledge to access or modify the
calculations (Healthcare, 2020, Henderson, 2020). These considerations are more critical in low
and middle-income countries, which may not have the resources to complete or modify such
analyses on their own.
Therefore, we developed a modeling tool for use by practicing public health officials to estimate
the future impact of the CoVID-19 outbreak on the demand for healthcare resources in their
jurisdictions and for examining the costs and benefits of various intervention strategies. Once
downloaded, the model can be used without an internet connection, to assist public health
officials with choosing locally applicable intervention strategies and by how much to increasing
hospital treatment capacity. For illustration, we apply the model to Chile, a Southern Hemisphere
2

country where the virus is generating local transmission, and compare various interventions
options in the three most affected regions of the country.
2. Methods
2.1. Tool Overview
We created a spreadsheet-based tool (Supplementary Material S1) that uses a Susceptible-LatentInfectious-Recovered (SEIR) Compartmental Model to project the future impact of a COVID-19
epidemic among any population of interest. The model requires information that is typically
available for public health officials, including the number of cases in their jurisdiction, the size
and demographics of their at-risk population, healthcare capacity, expectations for healthcare
use, and choices of societal-wide social-distancing mitigation strategies users wish to evaluate.
Model outputs reflect the potential demand on the healthcare system due to severely ill
individuals with and without user-specified mitigation strategies, as well as deaths averted
through treatment and excess deaths due to healthcare demand exceeding capacity. The demand
for healthcare resources is measured as the estimated number of CoVID-19 patients requiring
critical-care or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, hospital beds (non-ICU), and mechanical
ventilators over the course of the outbreak and the maximum occupancy at the outbreak’s peak.
The tool offers users the ability to evaluate various intervention strategies currently under
consideration and in use worldwide (Ferguson et al., 2020, Kissler et al., 2020, Willem et al.,
2020). These interventions comprise five mitigation-type interventions which focus on slowing
epidemic spread and reducing its burden on the healthcare system, and one suppression-type
strategy, which employs aggressive interventions aimed at reversing epidemic growth (Table 1).
[Table 1 about here]
Users can readily update all input values as new data become available or reflect a jurisdiction’s
specific epidemiologic profile of disease and policy considerations. All calculations can be
readily modified by users (although no modifications are necessary for tool use).
2.2. Calculations
2.2.1. Transmission with and without intervention
3

Our SEIR model tracks the number of individuals transitioning between disease states every day
of the outbreak. The initial number of susceptible individuals is set as the population minus the
cumulative number infected since the outbreak’s start. Transmission occurs through contacts
between susceptible and infectious individuals and we assume an equal probability any one
person has contact with another (“homogenous mixing”). We also assume transmission chains
generated by infected travelers entering the population are minimal compared to existing
transmission in the community. As a result, the number of new infections each day is the product
of the proportion of the population that is susceptible, the number of infectious persons on a
given day, and the average number of new infections each infected person causes over the span
of their illness (the reproduction number; hereafter, “R”) divided by the duration (in days) of the
average infectious period. Infectiousness is assumed to occur five days after infection (Lauer et
al., 2020) and lasts 11 days (You et al., 2020). Upon recovery from infection, individuals are
assumed immune to re-infection during the timespan modeled (through December 2020). In the
absence of intervention R is 2.0 (low estimate) and 2.8 (high estimate), approximately spanning
the middle 50% of the gamma distribution of R (95% intervals: 1.4-3.8) estimated from the early
growth-rate of the epidemic in Wuhan (Li et al., 2020, Riou and Althaus, 2020). To account for
uncertainty in R, all results are depicted as a range based on these low and high estimates for R.
During time periods where interventions are applied, we reduce the low and high estimates of R
by the values in Table 1. Upon mitigation concluding, R returns to pre-mitigation levels to
illustrate the potential consequences of shorter duration interventions. However, advanced users
can alter the tool so that when one mitigation strategy concludes, another begins. Finally, we do
not account for any vaccine as it is only likely to be available beyond the modeled time frame (Li
and De Clercq, 2020, Nature, 2020). All equations governing dynamics of the system are
provided in the supplementary material.
2.2.2. Hospitalizations and ICU admissions with and without intervention
In our model, all symptomatic persons with an illness severe enough to warrant hospitalization
will seek healthcare and the risk for hospitalization is age-dependent (Table 2) (Verity et al.,
2020). Similarly, the percentages of individuals admitted to the hospital requiring ICU care and
fatality are also age-dependent (Table 2), while the likelihood of patients admitted to the ICU
who require mechanical ventilation is assumed the same (63.2%) for all ages (ICNARC, 2020).
4

Based on observations for COVID19, we assume individuals seeking hospital care do so 11 days
after infection (five days incubation + six days of symptoms) (Chen et al., 2020, Li et al., 2020,
Linton et al., 2020, Zhang Guqin et al., 2020). We calculate hospital (non-ICU) bed occupancy
based on a ten day length of stay for patients treated entirely in non-critical hospital wards (Deng
et al., 2020, Wang Dawei et al., 2020) and ICU bed occupancy based on a ten day length of stay
when critical care is required (Verity et al., 2020, Zhang Guqin et al., 2020). We assume a four
day lag from hospital admission to ICU admission (Wang Dawei et al., 2020, Zhang Guqin et al.,
2020). When mechanical ventilation is required, we assume the duration of use is nine days,
based on expert clinical opinion that ventilation is necessary for the duration of ICU stays other
than two days (one-day lag post ICU admission to initiate ventilator use plus 1 day in the ICU
post-use) and another day required for ventilator cleaning/re-equipping.
[Table 2 about here]
To estimate the impact of interventions on hospital resource requirements we calculate two
measures for each of the three resources tracked in the model: 1) the reduction in peak
occupancy between the projected outbreak without intervention and when interventions are
employed, and 2) the number of weeks peak occupancy is delayed due to employed
interventions.

2.2.3. Deaths with and without intervention
We assume all deaths occur in the hospital unless treatment capacity is overwhelmed, and that it
takes the same time for an individual to recover and die, despite some preliminary evidence that
deaths occur faster (Deng et al., 2020, Linton et al., 2020). As such, we might be overestimating
the healthcare resources needed to treat the most critical patients (namely ventilators). Given the
limited evidence for outcome-based durations of resource use, we took a more conservative
approach, assuming planners would prefer to overestimate resources needs than under-prepare.
With treatment, fatality among infected (IFR) is age-dependent (Verity et al., 2020) (Table 2).
When hospital capacity is overwhelmed, we assume a 1% increase in the IFR, chosen to
approximately double the IFR in Chile, based on the observed reduction in IFR in China after
5

treatment capacity was augmented to meet demand (Zhang Zuqin et al., 2020). We also chose to
base our mortality increase for untreated CoVID19 patients on hospital bed availability (versus
critical care beds or ventilators) since the vast majority of cases do not require critical care
(~90% of cases in Chile). When more data become available, these assumptions can be updated.
Finally, we assume when beds become free at overwhelmed hospitals, new admissions are not
associated with a patient’s potential outcome.
To estimate the impact of interventions on deaths we calculate infection fatality rates with and
without interventions and the number of estimated deaths averted, as the difference in our
estimates of cumulative deaths with and without interventions.
2.3. Illustrative Scenarios and Sensitivity Analyses
To illustrate the model, we estimated the impact of implementing three intervention strategies in
three regions of Chile with the most detected cases through April 6, 2020: Región Metropolitana
(RM), an urban region with the largest population including the country’s capital Santiago, and
Araucanía and Ñuble, two of the least dense urban regions in Chile, but which had experienced
rapid growth in late March and were reporting treatment capacity was already strained. We
implemented the following three intervention strategies (Table 1) in each region, beginning April
1: Strategy 1) Closure of schools and universities and Telework for 8 months; Strategy 2) Case
isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals >70 years, and Telework for 8
months; and Strategy 3) Lockdown for 2 months (6 months shorter duration than the other
strategies because the social and economic costs of this suppression strategy are not considered
sustainable for the long-term). We chose these strategies because they are in use to some degree
in all three regions (Ministry of Health, 2020b, 2020c) (Supplementary Material 2).
We conducted two sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of varying the
implementation of mitigation strategies. First, we evaluated the influence of shortening the
duration (by 2, 4, and 6 months) of mitigation strategies by which successfully reduced our
healthcare demand estimates to within the range of treatment capacity. This analysis was chosen
since policymakers may be pressured to lift mitigation strategies as early as possible due to their
social disruption and economic costs. Then we evaluated the impact of combining the Lockdown
strategy with all other strategies, so that when the Lockdown strategy ends, another begins and
lasts 6 months. This analysis is intended to address the potential for the outbreak to rebound in
6

the absence of an intervention after a lockdown is lifted (Ferguson et al., 2020, Kissler et al.,
2020).
3. Results
3.1. Infections and Deaths without intervention
We estimate in the absence of any interventions, 5,682,168 to 6,592,016 infections would occur
over the course of the epidemic period modeled (5/5 – 12/31/20) in RM, 766,015 to 889,054
infections in Araucanía, and 384,509 to 446,285 infections in Ñuble (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Material S2). These projected counts reflect the possibility that 80% to 93% of
the populations in these regions may be infected in the absence of any control measures or
changes in individual behaviors. Under such a scenario, the number of deaths is projected to be
between 106,558 to 125,373 in RM (1.9% IFR), 13,860 to 16,378 deaths in Araucanía (1.8%
IFR), and 7,247 to 8,520 deaths in Ñuble (1.9% IFR).
3.2. Hospital Resource Demands with and without interventions
Without intervening to control the outbreak, demands for all three of the healthcare resources
evaluated by our model are projected to exceed capacity sometime in June in RM (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Material S2), and peak sometime between the end of July and mid-August.
Araucanía and Ñuble are projected to exceed capacity in July and peak sometime in August or
September (approximately one month after RM on both metrics). The degree to which demand is
projected to exceed supplies differs by region. In RM, peak demand across all resources is 6 to
18 times the projected maximum supplies available. The situation is similar in Araucanía and
Ñuble for hospital beds and ventilators, but is more dire for ICU beds: in both regions the
unmitigated peak ICU bed demand is between 13 and 47 times the supply.
Among the two mitigation strategies we evaluated (versus the suppression-type Lockdown
strategy), Strategy 2 reduced the burden on the healthcare system the most. In RM, compared to
the no intervention scenario, this strategy reduced peak hospital bed occupancy demands by a
range of 16,024 to 57,225 (35.4-69.2%), ICU bed occupancy between 2,945 to 8,270 beds (44.869.0%), and the number of ventilators needed by 1,572 to 4,237 (47.1-69.3%). This strategy
would also push the peak demand for healthcare resources back between 7 and 27 weeks,
affording policymakers more time to plan or acquire more capacity. Greater percent reductions
7

but similar delays in the peak demand were observed for Araucanía and Ñuble (Supplementary
Material S2).
Our results suggest that this strategy can ease the demands for healthcare to levels below
projected capacity constraints when the effectiveness of this strategy is at the higher end of our
assumed range (i.e. reductions in R0 approach 47.7%) (Table 1, Figure 1).
For policymakers willing to consider more restrictive measures, our results for the Lockdown
strategy, suggest it is an incredibly effective strategy, even for its short duration. The pandemic is
quickly subdued and remains so for the duration of the lockdown period in all three regions, with
the numbers of cases in treatment remaining relatively flat at levels well below treatment
capacity. However, once the lockdown is lifted the number of infected begins to rise again,
resulting in demand curves similar in size to the no-intervention scenario, but peaking later:
sometime between mid- August and late September (Figure 3, panel A).
FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE
3.3. Deaths averted with intervention
Based on the projected capacity to treat COVID patients in each region, the number of deaths
resulting from patients being unable to obtain healthcare was 53,515 to 63,836 in RM, 7,130 to
8,567 in Araucanía, and 3,657 to 4,354 in Ñuble. With Strategy 2, the estimated number of
deaths averted in RM ranged from 39,006 to 79,233 (36.6-63.2%), between 4,885 and 12,622 in
Araucanía (35.2-77.1%), and 2,018 to 6,742 in Ñuble (27.8-79.1%) (Table 4). Lockdown
eliminates between 99.8% and 99.9% of deaths in all three regions during the lockdown period,
but deaths rise afterwards with the subsequent rebound of transmission.
3.4. Sensitivity Analyses
Figure 2 depicts the effects of shortening the duration of intervention Strategy 2 on hospital bed
occupancy demands in RM to two (A), four (B), six (C) months of implementation versus our
initial eight month (D) duration. Similar to our baseline results for Strategy 3 (Lockdown), these
results show that effectiveness of interventions depends upon the length of time they overlap the
epidemic period. Specifically, if too many susceptible individuals remain (i.e., insufficient herd
immunity) at the time interventions are lifted, transmission will return. Even when interventions
8

are less effective (R is higher), if the intervention remains in place past peak demand, the
resulting outbreak may be smaller than when the same strategy is more effective (R is lower) but
lifted prior to peak demand (Figure 2, Panel C).
FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE
Figure 3 illustrates the results for combining a Lockdown suppression strategy with subsequent
mitigation strategies in RM. The benefit of this approach are an additional one to two months
delay in peak demand timing beyond delays afforded by each of the mitigation strategies on their
own. This approach, however, has no effect on the amount of demand (i.e. peak demand is
similar to the mitigation strategy without lockdown).
FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE
4. Discussion
In the absence of immunization, our illustrative results suggest the number of severely ill patients
could overwhelm treatment capacity as early as late May to mid-June in all three regions of Chile
we evaluated. Our projections also suggest that with immediate aggressive action to implement
several combinations of interventions the current amount of hospital beds and critical care beds
may be sufficient. In specific circumstances, regional authorities may find it easier to augment
their current capacity (e.g. ventilators in Ñuble) along with some mitigation strategies to meet
demand versus strictly burdening society with disruptive mitigations. Policymakers should be
aware, however, that our results indicate that more effective intervention strategies at temporarily
suppressing transmission can also result in larger epidemics upon lifting the strategy than less
effective, longer-lasting strategies (in the absence of vaccine and changes in individual
behavior). As such, it may be necessary to keep societal-wide interventions in place, or
intermittently start and stop them again based on active monitoring of cases counts and treatment
capacity, until a vaccine or treatment that can be administered outside of the hospital setting are
available.
While our projections are reasonable estimates for how the pandemic may play out given our
current understanding of SARS-CoV-2, they should not be considered as forecasts of what will
9

occur. This is due to the uncertainty in our understanding of an outbreak that is still unfolding,
the application of experiences of other countries to Chile (such as case severity, resource use by
non-COVID patients, intervention effectiveness, compliance over time), simplifying assumptions
(such as homogenous mixing), and case surveillance uncertainty. We assumed homogenous
mixing to make implementing our model in a spreadsheet more tractable, but as a result, do not
reflect potential important variabilities in contact patterns stemming from population social and
spatial structures or behavior differences that can affect population disease dynamics. Since
obtaining accurate data regarding contact patterns during an ongoing outbreak is challenging and
because these patterns may evolve with the outbreak we chose to focus on producing
the simplest useful model. To address case surveillance uncertainty, users can scale upwards or
downwards their case count inputs occurring over the prior two weeks based on perceived
underreporting or overreporting and examine the influence on outputs (as we did in our
illustrative scenario). Similarly, all assumptions and sources are explicitly presented in the tool,
and all can be readily modified by the user to reflect their interests and as new information
comes to light. Therefore, users should consider the value of this tool as its ability to support the
evaluation of relative differences in results associated with “what-if” scenarios.
COVID Surge has other limitations worth noting. Our estimates of beds and ventilators needed
and the number of deaths averted also depends on associated resources not modeled here. Such
resources include trained staff (respiratory therapists, nurses, and physicians) for the successful
clinical management of hospitalized and ventilated patients and ancillary supplies associated
with a bed or ventilator (e.g. electric circuits, oxygen, etc.). Furthermore, these resources may be
impacted by the pandemic itself: staff absenteeism due to illnesses (Wu and McGoogan, 2020)
and supply-chain disruptions in personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare personnel
may further exacerbate the situation. The effects of seasonality on the transmission dynamics of
COVID19 remains unclear, but the transmission of similar respiratory illnesses (e.g., influenza,
syncytial virus) peaks in the wintertime (Lipsitch and Viboud, 2009, Shaman and Kohn, 2009). If
COVID19 exhibits similar seasonality, or patients with these other illnesses place additional
demands on the healthcare system, there may be even fewer resources available to treat
COVID19 patients at the epidemic’s peak. Finally, we do not differentiate between specialized
pediatric and non-pediatric resources. While this is justifiable because the current pandemic does
not appear to pose a great enough risk to children to overwhelm pediatric healthcare capacity
10

(Riou et al., 2020, Verity et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020), users of the tool should take note of this
meaningful difference when inputting resource amounts.
4.1. Conclusions
Our model provides decision makers with the ability to examine the impacts of the current
COVID-19 pandemic in their jurisdictions and evaluate the effects of various social-distancing
mitigation strategies and augmenting treatment capacity on morbidity and mortality. The results
of our illustrative scenario underscore the need for policymakers to take immediate and
aggressive actions, and if they do so, substantial morbidity and mortality may be averted. As
more data become available (e.g. new treatments or healthcare capacity is augmented) and the
pandemic evolves (e.g. COVID case counts), our tool permits rapid updating of results
applicable for making decisions.

Case isolation
(mitigation)

Symptomatic cases stay at home for 7 days, reducing nonhousehold contacts during this period. Household contacts
remain unchanged.
Closing Schools/Universities: Physical closure of all schools
and universities (or move to virtual learning environment).
Assumes some increase in contacts in the household and the
community during the closure, partially offsetting reductions in
transmission at schools and universities.

Telework: All government switches to telework to the
maximum extent possible and private businesses are
encouraged to telework, resulting in 50% of the working
population teleworking.
Case isolation: same as above

25.4%

30.0%

Household quarantine: Following identification of a
symptomatic case in the household, all household members
voluntarily remain at home for 14 days. Increased transmission
between household members during the quarantine period will
partially offset transmission reductions in the community.
Case isolation: same as above

Social Distancing of >70s: Reduce contacts among older
individuals (>70 years of age) because of their increased risk
for severe outcomes and healthcare resource requirements.
These individuals reduce contacts outside the home by 50%.
Telework: same as above

Lockdown
(suppression)

Population-wide social distancing by forced quarantine of all
households and workplaces, and border closed to travel. Only
essential outings from the home are permitted (e.g.
food/supplies purchases) and for employees working at
businesses deemed essential for continued operation.

Notes
a
R0 = basic reproduction number. It represents the average number of people who will be infected by any given
infected person at the early stages of disease spread when there are no control measures.
b
High and Low values of the reduction in transmission associated with each strategy were used to account for
uncertainty in societal compliance and strategy effectiveness. These reductions were based on equivalent
reductions in Critical Care Bed Occupancy published in Ferguson et al. (2020) (Supplementary Material S2). We
added 10 percentage points to reduction values for strategies including telework, based on Willem et al. (2020).

All beds available in the healthcare system, from public and private hospitals, are now part of the “Sistema
Integrado COVID-19” under the centralized administration of the Ministry of Health. An intensive care bed (ICU)
consists of a cot with a monitor, healthcare professionals and medication to treat patient. Some have a mechanical
ventilator. There are an estimated 1,847 mechanical ventilators; 850 currently available and 997 were acquired in
January 2020.(Latorre and Sandoval, 2020) We assumed the distribution of mechanical ventilators was proportional
to the number of critical beds in each region: Metropolitana,47.0%; Araucanía, 4.3%; Ñuble, 1.2%. (Supplementary
Material S2)
e
Based on the reported number hospitalized in “basic beds” (1,216) and in “critical care beds” (699) in all of Chile
by the Ministry of Health as of May 4, 2020 out of the total existing beds nationally in March 2020 plus anticipated
beds being added to expand pandemic treatment capacity: 41,706 and 4,954, respectively. Latorre et al.(2020)
f
Availability of mechanical ventilators was based on a three-year study of 97 ICUs in the US.(Wunsch et al., 2013)

SEIR Model
The model consists of individuals who are either Susceptible (S), Infected but not yet Infectious
(E), Infectious (I), Total Recovered and Died (D). It projects and tracks the number of
individuals moving between these categories every day of the outbreak. Projections begin on the
day following the date input by users for the last day of the most recent 2-weeks of cases
available. On this date, there are only Susceptible and Infectious individuals. The epidemic then
proceeds via a growth and decline process: As the number of susceptible individuals is depleted
(once individuals are infected) the spread of the infection slows. Individuals in the Infectious (I)
category includes those who are not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic) but will become
symptomatic, those who are symptomatic, and those who are infectious yet not exhibiting
symptoms (asymptomatic). The dynamics are given by the following equations such that on any
given day t, the number individuals Susceptible (S), Infectious (I), Recovered (L), and Died (D)
are:

where:
N is the population size,
R is the number of new infections each infected persons causes with R = R0 when no
mitigation strategy is in place and R=Re when a mitigation strategy is being used, and
κ is the number of days needed to become infectious after being infected.
1/γ is the number of days needed to recover (or die) once infectious.
α is the proportion of infected that die (i.e. infection fatality rate (IFR)) with 𝛼 = 𝛼1 when
hospitals have capacity to treat and 𝛼 = 𝛼2 when capacity is overwhelmed
Note: the Infected but not yet Infectious state (E) is not calculated each day in our tool (i.e. not
given it’s own data column), but still contributes to the model by delaying when infected persons
begin to contribute to the force of infection.

Reductions in R0 Associated with Interventions
We chose the reductions in R0 for each intervention strategy by determining the reduction applied to R0 =2.4 (no intervention) in our
model which produced comparable percent declines and delays in peak critical care (ICU) bed occupancy from the “do nothing
scenario” observed in Ferguson et al.’s 1 Figure 2. Table S1 shows how these were determined.

Interventions Application Timeline in Chile 2,3
Closure of all daycares, schools, and universities was mandated across all of Chile on March 16;
followed by case isolation, and mandatory home quarantine for CoVID19 patients on March 19,
and the implementation of flexible work schedules and telework for government workers began
March 20. Social distancing measures across Chile include bans on nursing homes visits (03/16),
closures of non-essential business (03/20, e.g., restaurants, pubs, night clubs), night curfews
(03/22), and bans on meetings and events ≥50 people (03/24). Additionally, since March 28, two
major cities in Araucanía, and seven municipalities in Santiago are under a mandatory lockdown.
