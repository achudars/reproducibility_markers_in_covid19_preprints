Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a very high number of casualties
in the general population. Assessing the exact magnitude of this number is a non-trivial
problem, as relying only on officially reported COVID-19 associated fatalities runs the risk
of incurring in several kinds of biases. One of the ways to approach the issue is to compare
overall mortality during the pandemic with expected mortality computed using the observed
mortality figures of previous years. In this paper, we build on existing methodology and
propose two ways to compute expected as well as excess mortality, namely at the weekly
and at the yearly level. Particular focus is put on the role of age, which plays a central part
in both COVID-19-associated and overall mortality. We illustrate our methods by making
use of age-stratified mortality data from the years 2016 to 2020 in Germany to compute age
group-specific excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Introduction

First identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus developed into a worldwide pandemic during the spring of 2020
(Velavan and Meyer, 2020). One of the challenges for scientists has been to evaluate its impact
in terms of life loss across different countries and regions of the world. A possible way to do this
is through directly looking at the number of people who died while they were confirmed to be
infected. This measure, often defined as COVID-19-associated mortality, is certainly more robust
than other pandemic-related quantities such as e.g. the number of reported COVID-19 cases, for
which it has become clear that there is a non-negligible discrepancy between cases detected
through tests and the number of individuals who were infected (Lau et al., 2021; Schneble et al.,
2021). Nonetheless, the raw number of COVID-related fatalities can be subject to biases and
interpretative issues as well. In particular, this number might also be biased downwards, as
COVID-19 cases can still remain unreported until and after the point of death. Moreover, it
is not always straightforward to identify if COVID-19 was the primary cause of death: Some
patients might have a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the actual contribution of the virus to the
death might be minimal (Vincent and Taccone, 2020). To deal with these issues, comparing
all-cause mortality is generally considered a more robust alternative for assessing the damage
done by the pandemic, and to compare its impact between regions or countries. A first look
at this matter for Germany was provided by Stang et al. (2020), who looked at data from the
first wave ranging from calendar weeks 10 to 26 in 2020. The authors came to the conclusion
that a moderate excess mortality was observable for this period in Germany, in particular for
the elderly. Morfeld et al. (2021) consider regional variation in mortality in Germany during
the first wave (see also Morfeld et al., 2020). A calculation of the years of life lost over the

course of the pandemic in Germany in 2020 was pursued by Rommel et al. (2021). International
analyses on excess mortality due to COVID-19 include e.g. Krieger et al. (2020), looking at data
from Massachusetts, Vandoros (2020) who focuses on England and Wales, and Michelozzi et al.
(2020) investigating mortality in Italian cities. Global analyses in this direction were pursued
by Karlinsky and Kobak (2021) and Aburto et al. (2021).
Monitoring excess mortality has a long tradition as part of analysing the impact of pandemics
(Johnson and Mueller, 2002; Simonsen et al., 2013). With the EuroMOMO project, Europe
also runs an early-warning system specifically dedicated to mortality monitoring (Mazick et al.,
2007). However, no unified methodological definition exists for deciding if the currently observed
death counts are higher than what would be expected. A very simple approach is to compare the
currently observed deaths for a selected time-period with the average of death counts for a similar
period in previous years1 . Alternatively, the expected value can be computed by an underlying
time-series model based on past values, e.g. including seasonality and excluding past phases of
excess, as done in the EuroMOMO project (see e.g. Vestergaard et al., 2020; Nørgaard et al.,
2021). These approaches, however, do not come without problems, as the age structure within
a population can change significantly over time. Given that both general and COVID-related
mortality are heavily dependent on age (Dowd et al., 2020; Levin et al., 2020), raw comparisons
not taking age into account will often lead to biased estimates. More sophisticated approaches
thus need to adjust for different or changing age structures in the population. The latter point is
of particular relevance when looking at aging populations (Kanasi et al., 2016) and the infectious
risks for the elderly (Kline and Bowdish, 2016). Such age-adjustments have a long tradition
in demography when comparing mortality across different regions with different age-structure
(Keiding and Clayton, 2014; Kitagawa, 1964). A general discussion on aging populations and
mortality can be found in Crimmins and Zhang (2019).
In this paper, we build on existing methodology to propose two ways of calculating expected
mortality taking age into account, respectively at the weekly and at the yearly level. These
methods are compared to the existing benchmarks on data from Germany over the years 20162019, for which age-stratified information is available. We furthermore apply those methods to
assess age group-specific excess mortality in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
The remainder of the manuscript is structured as follows. In Section 2 we look at yearly expected
mortality, while the weekly view is pursued in Section 3. Section 4 ends the paper with some
interpretative caveats and concluding remarks.

Yearly Excess Mortality

We first look at yearly data and tackle the question of whether there was excess mortality in
Germany in 2020. In order to obtain an age adjustment for mortality data we calculate expected
deaths based on official life tables. Life tables give the probability qx of a person who has
completed x years of age to die before completing their next life-year, i.e. before their x + 1th
birthday. In our analysis we consider the death table provided for the year 2017/2019 from
the Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Destatis, 2020). The calculation of a life table, as
simple as it sounds, is not straightforward and is an age-old actuarial problem. First references
date far back, to Price (1771) and Dale (1772). A historical digest of the topic is provided by
Keiding (1987). Over the last decades, the calculation of the German life-tables made use of
different methods proposed in Becker (1874), Raths (1909) and Farr (1859). We will come back
to this point and demonstrate that further adjustments are recommendable to relate the expected
number of deaths to recently observed ones. In particular, with increasing life expectancy, the
average age of the German population has been steadily increasing (see e.g. Buttler, 2003), and
this has some effect on the validity of life tables, as discussed in Dinkel (2002). Generally, an
aging population leads to increasingly high yearly death tolls (see e.g. Klenk et al., 2007). To
quantify excess mortality one therefore needs to account for age effects, e.g., leading to the

standardized mortality ratio (SMR, see e.g. Rothman et al., 2008). The SMR is defined as the
ratio of observed death counts over expected deaths and thus allows for an age adjusted view,
meaning that instead of pure death counts one takes the (dynamic) age structure into account.
Calculating excess mortality on a yearly basis requires to calculate expected fatalities using
life tables provided by the relevant statistical bureau. We make use of data provided by the
Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Destatis, 2020). A straightforward way of obtaining the
expected number of deaths for age group A in year y is to calculate
X
eA,y =
qx Px,y
(1)
x∈A

where Px,y is the population size of individuals aged x years at the beginning of year y, and qx
are, e.g., the age-specific death probabilities in the most recent German life table from the years
2017/19, calculated following Raths (1909). More specifically, let Dx be the cumulated number
of individuals that died aged x year old, i.e. before their x + 1-th birthday in the considered
years 2017 to 2019. Let Px,y denote the population size of x year old individuals on December
31st in year y ∈ {2016, 2017, 2018, 2019}. Then qx provided in the German life-tables is defined
as
qx =

We label (1) in combination with (2) as Method 1 below. We will see that this quantity is biased
for estimating the expected number of deaths of x year old people in year y. To motivate this
we look at the Lexis diagram in Figure 1, and for simplicity we replace the calculation in (2)
by looking at a single year only, i.e from y = t to y = t + 1. This leads to Dx = I + II, where
I and II refer to the observed deaths in the two triangles in Figure 1. Note that following the
calculation principle (2) of the Statistisches Bundesamt we would obtain qx as
qx =

where Px,t and Px,t+1 are the population sizes of x year old indicated in Figure 1. That is, qx
is the probability of dying in triangles I and II. Let us define with q̃x the probability of an
3

individual aged x years old at the beginning of year t (i.e. on December 31st in year t − 1) to die
before year t + 1 starts. In other words q̃x is the probability of dying in triangles II and III.
In fact, this is the probability we are interested in. It is easy to see that q̃x 6= qx . Assuming
that the probability of dying in triangle I is roughly equal to the probability of dying in triangle
II, and assuming the same relationship for triangles III and IV holds, we can conclude the
approximate equivalence
q̃x =

which leads to the expected number of deaths

ẽA,y =

x∈A

We label (5) as Methods 2 below. The adjustment is still not complete, and in fact it can be
shown that (5) is biased (see Hartz et al., 1983). Note that individuals dying in triangle III
count as x + 1 years old, so that part of the deaths contributes to a different age group. We may
now assume for simplicity that the probability of dying in triangles II and III is roughly the
same, which leads to the following calculation. Let A = [al , ar ]
ar−1

êA,y = 0.5 · q̃al−1 Pal−1 ,y +

where q̃−1 = q̃0 and P−1,y = P0,y gives the approximation for the youngest age group. Accordingly, for ar = max(x) we take the full fraction of the last year, that is we add an additional
0.5 · q̃ar par ,y to the formula above. We label (6) as Method 3 below.
Based on these three methods we can now compare expected and observed fatalities over the
last years using the same 2017/2019 life-table as basis. Note that, when looking at different years,
one may more accurately also take different life tables to account for changing life expectancy.
We omit this point for simplicity since we only look at five years, and changes in life expectancy
over this short period were moderate (Wenau et al., 2019). Figure 2 gives a first overview of the
results for all age groups combined. We plot the observed death counts (black dots), and the
expected counts based on the different methods are visualised as dashed lines in different colours.
We can see that Method 1, which uses (1), clearly underestimates the expected death counts.
Method 2 and Methods 3 perform equally well, which is not surprising, since we do not take an
age-specific view. The latter is carried out in Figure 3 for all different age groups available from
the data. This age-specific view shows how Methods 2 and 3 differ, and that overall Method
3 shows the better fit. We can quantify this discrepancy by calculating the root mean squared
error for the different age groups, where we explicitly exclude year 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic. The results of this can be found in Table 1.
Having established that Method 3 performs better than the other two over past years, we
can use the expected number of fatalities computed with this method for 2020 to quantify the
excess mortality during the first calendar year of the corona pandemic in Germany. Table 2
contains expected and observed mortality for all age groups in 2020, as well as the absolute and
percentage variations between the two. We see from the table that, for the entire population,
the age-adjusted excess mortality was in the order of 1% in 2020. We stress that these results
in terms of COVID-19 impact need to be interpreted with utmost care: We here focus on the
methodological aspects, and defer the subject-matter discussion of the results to Section 4.

Weekly Excess Mortality

The yearly view presented in the previous section does not allow to take within-year seasonality into account for the expected deaths. We therefore now look at weekly excess mortality

statements. Classical standardization approaches such as direct and indirect standardization
can be used to adjust the observed values for age effects, see e.g. Kitagawa (1964). We will
focus on indirect standardization, but given an appropriate choice of reference population, direct
standardization approaches are straightforward adaptations.

Figure 4: Weekly mortality probability estimates q̂t,a as well as the range (min-max) of the
corresponding mortality probablities of the past four years and their mean q t,x .
Let qt,x be the mortality probability specific to age x and time period t. In what follows, the
considered time period will be one International Organization for Standardization (ISO) week,
but other intervals (e.g. months) are also imaginable. We estimate qt,x by dividing the number of
observed deaths at age x during time period t, defined as Dt,x , by the corresponding population
at the beginning of the time period, i.e. Pt,x . To be specific, we define
q̂t,x =

7

Dt,x
.
Pt,x

(7)

Since the age-stratified population is only available as a point estimate for the 31st of December
of each year, we use linear interpolation to estimate Pt,x . Furthermore, the exact population of
the current year, i.e. on December 31st, 2020, is not known at the time of analysis. We thus use
a corresponding population projection: Similarly to Ragnitz (2021), we use the Destatis variant
G2-L2-W22 . The corresponding estimates of weekly mortality probabilities (7) are shown in
Figure 4. We see that in age groups ≥ 50 years a substantial weekly excess mortality is observable
from week 45 on, with more pronounced excess mortality for the elderly.
A weekly SMR-based excess mortality measure for the entire year 2020 can now be computed
as follows. Let t denote a specific ISO week in 2020, i.e. this will serve as notational shorthand
for ISO week 2020-Wt, where t = 1, . . . , 53. We form the expected age-time mortality probability
for this week by computing the average of the mortality of the same week over the last 4 years,
i.e.
2019
1 X
q t,x =
q̂y-Wt,x , t = 1, . . . , 53.
4 y=2016
Because the years 2016-2019 do not have an ISO week 53, we define y-W53 for y = 2016, . . . , 2019
as 12 (qy-W52 + q(y+1)-W01 ). The indirect standardization now computes the expected number of
deaths for week t as
et,x = q t,x · Pt,x
This corresponds to the expected number of deaths in week t at age x, if the current population
would have been subject to the average death probability over the past 4 years. Since fatalities
are not given with exact ages but rather by age group, we indicate this by using qt,A , Pt,A and
et,A , where A denotes the age classes. For the available Destatis mortality data the six groups
are [00 − 30), [30 − 40), [40 − 50), [50 − 60), [60 − 70), [70 − 80), [80, ∞). Fig. 4 shows q̂t,A as
well as q t,x for Germany. Note that the comparison for week 53 with the past year is done
using the imputation scheme described above. Also note that this computation is equivalent
to computing, for each reference year y, the expected number of deaths for the relevant week
in 2020, and then taking the average of the expected deaths. In other words: by applying the
mortality probabilities for the same week of the reference year y to our study population (i.e.
2020-Wt) and then averaging the four expected fatalities, we get:
et,x

2019
1 X
=
qy-Wt,x · Pt,x .
4 y=2016

One can now define the absolute excess mortality in week t and age-group A as Dt,A − et,A .
Instead of focusing on absolute differences, it is better in terms of interpretation to look at
relative estimates of excess mortality given by the standardized mortality ratio (SMR)
SM Rt,A =

Dt,A
.
et,A

(8)

We plot the corresponding weekly estimate resulting from (8) for all age groups in Figure 5.
As already seen in the incidence plots, we note that in the older age groups the first approx.
10 weeks of the year had a rather low SMR, followed by a small increase consistent with the
first COVID-19 wave. Furthermore, substantial increases are then seen in in the ≥ 50 year old
age groups starting from week 45, coinciding with the 2nd wave, and reaching up to 40% more
deaths than expected in certain weeks.
If we instead aggregate observed and expected counts per year, we could also generate yearly
excess-mortality statements similar to Tab. 2 (see e.g. Höhle, 2021 for comparison).

Direct standardization
Whereas the indirect standardization strategy, pursued above, extrapolates the average death
probability from the past to the current population, an alternative is to apply the mortality
probabilities from each reference year to a common standard population and then compare
these numbers. This approach is, e.g., used by Statistics Austria3 and uses the Eurostat 2013
population as common reference4 :
esy-Wt,A = qy-Wt,A · Pas ,
where PAs denotes the size of the standard population in age-group A and the expected number
P2019
of deaths for the week t in 2020 is given by est,A = y=2016 esy-Wt,A /4.

Discussion

The COVID-19 pandemic posed numerous challenges to scientists. One of those challenges lies
in estimating the number of casualties brought upon by the pandemic. To tackle this issue, we
pursued an approach based on comparing observed all-cause mortality in 2020 with the number
of fatalities that would have been expected in the same year without the advent of COVID19. Building on existing methodology, we proposed two simple ways of computing expected
mortality at the yearly and at the weekly level. We then put those method to work to obtain
estimates for excess mortality in 2020 in Germany. The two approaches yield similar results
at the aggregate level, and highlight how 2020 was characterized by an overall excess mortality
of approximately 1%. The light excess mortality was apparently driven by a spike in fatalities
related to COVID-19 at the end of the year in older age groups.

Interpreting COVID-19 mortality has become a politically sensitive issue, where the same
underlying data are used to either enhance or downplay the consequences of COVID-19 infections.
We therefore stress that our interests are methodological, and that the presented results are
restricted to the calendar year 2020 for Germany as a whole. Altogether, the mild mortality in
the older age groups during the first weeks (e.g. due to a mild influenza season) balanced the
excess in the higher age groups which came later in the year. Clearly noticeable is the second
wave during Nov-Dec 2020, which also continued in the early months of 2021. To better account
for such seasonality, excess mortality computations for influenza are often pursued by season
instead of calendar year, i.e. in the northern hemisphere for the period from July in Year X to
June in Year X + 1 (Nielsen et al., 2011). Similarly, the impact of COVID-19 cases and fatalities
was not only temporally, but also spatially heterogeneous, with strong peaks in Dec 2020 in
the federal states of Saxony, Brandenburg and Thuringia (Höhle, 2021). Hence, using mortality
aggregates over periods and regions only provides a partial picture of the impact of COVID-19.
Furthermore, the mortality figures observed in 2020 naturally incorporate the effects of all types
of pandemic management consequences, which include changes in the behavior of the population
(voluntary or due to interventions). Disentangling the complex effects of all-cause mortality
and the COVID-19 pandemic is a delicate matter, which takes experts in several disciplines
(demographers, statisticians, epidemiologists) to solve. Timely analysis of all-cause mortality
data is just one building block of this process; Nevertheless, the pandemic has shown the need
to do this in near real-time based on sound data while adjusting for age structure.
Our analysis was motivated by the fact that many of the methods that have been applied
to tackle this issue so far fail to take the changing age structure of the population into account.
This can lead to biased results, and especially so for the rapidly aging developed countries. In
the case of Germany, for example, the absolute number of people aged 80 or more increased by
approximately 20% from 2016 to 2020. Such a remarkable increase will naturally have an effect
on overall mortality, and as such direct comparisons in the number of casualties across different
years will lead to significant overestimation of the excess mortality. Our approaches are instead
robust to such changes in population structure, and can be used regardless of the demographic
context. Note that, for both of our approaches, it would also be possible to obtain confidence
intervals through imposing simple distributional assumptions. The same methodologies could be
used to pursue a similar analysis for any country in which mortality data and a mortality table
are available, for any given year. A natural use for the proposed methodology would also be to
assess the overall damages caused by the pandemic when it will be finally considered a thing
of the past. All in all, we hope the proposed methods will help shedding light on the issue of
computing the expected number of fatalities, and in the assessment of potential excess mortality.
