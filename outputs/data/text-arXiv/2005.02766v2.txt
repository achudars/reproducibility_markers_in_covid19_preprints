SIMULTANEOUS ESTIMATION OF THE EFFECTIVE
REPRODUCING NUMBER AND THE DETECTION RATE OF
COVID-19
YORIYUKI YAMAGATA

Abstract. A major difficulty to estimate R (the effective reproducing number) of COVID-19 is that most cases of COVID-19 infection are mild or asymptomatic, therefore true number of infection is difficult to determine. This paper
estimates the daily change of R and the detection rate simultaneously using
a Bayesian model. The analysis using synthesized data shows that our model
correctly estimates R and detects a short-term shock of the detection rate.
Then, we apply our model to data from several countries to evaluate the effectiveness of public healthcare measures. Our analysis focuses Japan, which
employs a moderate measure to keep “social distance”. The result indicates a
downward trend and now R becomes below 1. Although our analysis is preliminary, this may suggest that a moderate policy still can prevent epidemic
of COVID-19.

1. Introduction
In the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Japanese government gradually
employed public health measures against COVID-19. In the first stage, the stronger
quarantine measures at the border were implemented. Once patients who had
no connection to Wuhan appeared inside the border, The government started to
track these patients as far as possible and tried to find people contacted to these
patients. Once these “track and quarantine clusters” tactics were overwhelmed
by the number of patients, the government started to ask behavior changes to
people, culminating “declaration of the emergency” on April 6. Public facilities
like libraries were closed. Large shopping malls and entertainment businesses, such
as movie theatres, were asked to be closed. Restaurants are asked to shorten their
operating hours and stop providing alcoholic beverages at night. Working from
home was encouraged, and the citizens were advised to avoid crowded areas and
generally avoid going outside unnecessarily. However, the Japanese legal system
does not have enough mechanisms to enforce these policies. Thus the effectiveness
of these policies can be questioned. Many people are still commuting to their office
because many companies lack the necessary ability to allow their employees to
work from home. Many small restaurants and cafes are still running their business
because of the lack of financial compensation.
To estimate the policy effect to COVID-19, we need estimate daily changes of the
effective reproducing number R. A major difficulty to estimate R of COVID-19 is
that most cases of COVID-19 infection are mild or asymptomatic, therefore the true
number of infection is difficult to determine. This paper estimates the daily change
of R and the detection rate simultaneously using a Bayesian model. The analysis

using synthesized data shows that our model correctly estimates R and detects a
short-term shock of the detection rate. Our analysis focuses Japan, which employs
a moderate measure to keep “social distance”. The result indicates a downward
trend and now R becomes below 1. Although our analysis is preliminary, this may
suggest that a moderate policy still can prevent epidemic of COVID-19.
Then, we apply our model to data from several countries to evaluate the effectiveness of public healthcare measures. The comparison between Denmark and
Sweden reveals that lock-down is very effective in short term. However, In Sweden, which did not employ lock-down, R also reduced and now R of both countries
are roughly same. This might suggest that lock-down is not effective long run, or
Denmark is disadvantageous against COVID-19 comparing to Sweden.
Further, we applied our method to China, Italy and US and show that these
countries are also about exiting from epidemic.

2. Related works
Several works employ data-driven methods to predict and measure the public
health measure of COVID-19.
Anastassopoulou et al. [1] apply the SIRD model to Chinese official statistics,
estimating parameters using linear regression. The reporting rate is not estimated
from data but assumed. By these models and parameters, they predict the COVID19 epidemic in Hubei province.
Diego Caccavo [2] and independently Peter Turchin [6] apply modified SIRD
models, in which parameters change overtime following specific function forms.
Parameters govern these functions are estimated by minimizing the sum-of-squareerror. However, using the sum-of-square method causes over-fitting and always
favors a complex model, therefore it is not suitable to access policy effectiveness.
Further, fitting the SIRD model in the early stage of infection is difficult, as pointed
out in stat-exchange 1. Using a Bayesian method, we avoid these problems to some
degree, because a Bayesian method estimates parameter distribution instead of a
point estimate. Thus, we can assess the degree of confidence of each parameter.
Further, by well-established statistical methods, we can compare the explanatory
power of different models.
Flaxman et al. [4] use a Bayesian model to estimate policy effectiveness. The
methodology is different from us because they assume immediate effects from the
policies implemented. Further, they use a discrete renewal process, a more advanced
model than the SIRD model. They use parameters estimated from studies of clinical
cases while we use a purely data-driven method.

3. Method and materials
3.1. Model. We use the discrete-time SIR model but assume that the number of
move between each category is stochastic and follows Poisson distribution.

When R becomes < 1 then the infection starts to decline.
We cannot expect that these values are directly observable, because many (or
most) cases are mild or asymptomatic. Therefore, we introduce the detection rate
q and let the number of cumulative observed cases Cobs and recovered Robs as

Iobs (t + 1) = Iobs (t) + N Iobs (t) − N Robs (t)
Robs (t + 1) = Robs (t) + N Robs (t)

We assume that β and q change day to day bases while other parameters are fixed.
To get a reasonable estimate, we assume prior distributions somewhat arbitrary
chosen.

S(0) = I(0) ∼ Student t(3, 0, 1)

(12)

β(0) ∼ Student t(3, 0, 1)

(13)

β(t + 1) ∼ Student t(3, β(t), σb )

(14)

σb ∼ Exponential(1)

while the prior of q(t) is the uniform distribution over [0, 1]. To make our model
robust, we choose Student-t as the prior for β. We perform a sensitivity analysis
of the prior for σb to ensure that the choice of priors does not strongly affect the
result.
3.2. Data. The number of confirmed cases of each country up to May 11 were
drawn from data repository 2 by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems
Science and Engineering. The dataset also contains the number of recovery, but as
pointed out in README the number is underestimated. For example, the number
of recovery in Norway is only 32 in May 11, which is impossible with 8132 confirmed
cases. Therefore, we estimate γ = 0.04 per day by Chinese data and assume that
γ is constant across all countries.

3.3. Experiment. First, we performed model validation using synthesized data of
the scenarios in which β and q are constant, β is constant but q is piecewise constant,
β reduces linearly and q is constant with white noise and β, q are constant where β
is high enough to make almost all people obtain immunity. The result is presented
in Section 4.1.
Then the real-world data were fed to Stan [3] for parameter estimation by our
Bayesian model. We simplified our model to ease modeling in Stan. Because latent
discrete variables cannot be used in Stan, we
√ used real numbers for N I(t) and
N R(t). We used normal approximation N (λ, λ) for the Poisson distribution used
for N I(t). For N R(t), we replaced stochastic laws to deterministic laws N R(t) = γI
to avoid a numerical issue.
Parameter estimation used 10,000 iterations with 5,000 iterations for warm-up
and 5,000 iterations for sampling. Four (default number of Stan) independent
computations were performed simultaneously and used to estimate R̂. If R̂ < 1.1
then we regard that the estimation is converged.
To make sure that our results are meaningful, we compared the performance of
our model with a model (we refer it by “the constant model” const), which assumes
constant β and q and a model (we refer it by “the constant detection rate model”
const-q). const estimates constant β and q simultaneously but const-q takes q as
a part of given data. Parameters were estimated for const and const-q in the same
way and LOO, a standard measure of model performance, was compared. Because
the exact computation of LOO-CV is computationally expensive, approximation
PSIS-LOO-CV [7] and WAIC [8] were compared. Further, we check the reliability
of these estimation by checking the Pareto-k for the importance weight distribution.
The computation of PSIS-LOO-CV and WAIC is performed by ArviZ [5].
Models and the computation history used for this experiment are public at
GitHub 3.
4. Results
4.1. Model validation. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show the estimated β and q for synthesized data using β = 0.07 and q = 0.2. Fig 1 also shows the estimated β by
const-q model. the true q = 0.2 is given to const-q model as data.
The results show that both models can estimate beta correctly, while completely
fail to estimate q. Estimated q is biased to 1 and noisy. Therefore, our method
cannot estimate the absolute level of the detection rate. However, the estimate of
β is still accurate so our method can be used to estimate β. In fact, Fig. 3 and
Fig. 5 shows that our model is robust against changing q.
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the estimated β and q for synthesized data using constant
β = 0.07 but changing q which goes 1 to 0.8 in Apr. 1.
Fig 3 shows β estimated by const-q model drops at April 1. Although the
estimate by our model also drops around the same date, the drop is less significant.
This indicates that allowing q vary makes an estimated β robust against a sudden
change of q.
Fig. 5 and Fig 6 show the estimated β and q for synthesized data using linearly
decreasing β and noisy q. Fig. 5 shows that our method is smooth while the estimate
of const-q is noisy. Again, this shows that our model is more robust against
changing q. Further, Fig 6 indicates that while the estimated q is biased toward

1, the short-term change coincides the ground truth. Therefore, the estimated q is
still useful to find a short-term shock to the detection rate.
Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show the estimate of β and q for data generated with constant
β and q. Unlike Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, β and time horizon are chosen so that most of
population are infected in the end. The result shows that the estimate of β becomes
unreliable when the infection starts saturated. Therefore, our model is only useful
for the case of a low infection rate. The estimated β by const-q swings widely,
therefore is omitted.

In summary, the estimate of β, which is a key parameter for estimate R, by our
model is robust against sudden changes and noise in q, even though the estimate
of q itself is unreliable. When the infection begins to saturate among population,
the estimate of β as well as q becomes unreliable.
4.2. Analysis of Japan. Next, we present our analysis of Japanese data.
First, we applied three models, const, const-q and our model (varied-q) to
Japanese data. For all parameters of all models, R̂ < 1.1 holds so convergence is
excellent. Then two information criteria, PSIS-LOO-CV and WAIC are applied to
const, const-q and varied-q. The results are shown in Table 1.

Table 1 shows that our model, varied-q, is the best model. However, we need
to be careful because the difference between const-q is not large. Further, there is
a data point in which the Pareto-k for the importance weight distribution is larger
than 0.7. Therefore, the model is not robust and influenced too much from small
numbers of data points.
Keeping this in mind, we tentatively choose varied-q and we analyze the result
of varied-q.

upward trend may not be very reliable because there is a few data for infection.

explained by public awareness and tracking effort of infection. After the mid.
March, the tracking effort might be overwhelmed, thus created an upward trend
until the beginning of April, when “the state of emergency” was declared to major
urban areas. Since then, there was a downward trend, and now R is below 1. Thus,
currently the infection is shrinking.

sensitivity of the result to prior distributions using Japanese data as an example.

prior σb ∼ Exponential(0.1). There is no significant difference of estimates between
two priors; therefore we can safely conclude that the effect of prior is small.
4.4. Comparison of Denmark and Sweden. Next, we compare Denmark and
Sweden. These countries are economically and socially similar countries, but employed very different policies against COVID-19.
We applied the same procedure as Japan to data from two countries. All parameters are converged and information criteria favor varied-q model. For Sweden, we
only applied data from Mar 1. because the confirmed cases only appear in February 27. The estimated R clearly shows that lock-down introduced March 13. was
effective to put down R. However, in Sweden, which did not employ lock-down, R
reduced gradually and now R is almost same between Denmark and Sweden. This
might suggest that lock-down is not very effective in long run but might also due
to unfavorable conditions to Denmark, for example, higher population density.
4.5. Multi-national comparison. Fig. 13 shows daily estimate of R of China,
Italy, Japan and US. The same method as Japan was applied to the rest of countries
and adequacy of varied-q model was verified. For Italy, we only apply data from

same method was applied to Korea but the parameter estimation does not converge.
The results show that China, Italy, Japan, and the US are about to exit epidemic.
5. Future work
The method used in this paper has several limitations.
First, as experiment used simulation data revealed, our method cannot determine
the true level of detection rate, nor its long-term trends. To find the true detection
rate, we need different kind of data, such as excess mortality.
