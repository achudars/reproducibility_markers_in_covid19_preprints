Abstract
An epidemiological compartmental model was used to simulate social distancing strategies to
contain the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent a second wave in São Paulo, Brazil. Optimization
using genetic algorithm was used to determine the optimal solutions. Our results suggest the
best-case strategy for São Paulo is to maintain or increase the current magnitude of social
distancing for at least 60 more days and increase the current levels of personal protection
behaviors by a minimum of 10% (e.g., wearing facemasks, proper hand hygiene and avoid
agglomeration). Followed by a long-term oscillatory level of social distancing with a steppingdown approach every 80 days over a period of two years with continued protective behavior.

Mathematical model of COVID-19 intervention scenarios for
São Paulo- Brazil
The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic in
March of 20201. Two months later over 4.3 million people have tested positive for the virus
resulting in more than 300,000 deaths worldwide2. Most countries, including Brazil, have
implemented widespread social distancing (SD) restrictions in an effort to mitigate the spread
of COVID-19. It appears, from updated models, that these strategies have effectively reduced
the number of cases and associated deaths compared to earlier predictions3. However, a new
report indicated that SD measures in Brazil have not been as effective at reducing the
reproduction number (R0) as it has in other countries4. R0 represents the average number of
secondary cases that result from the introduction of a single infectious case in a susceptible
population5. The R0 for Brazil is 2.81, while the R0 for China, for example, dropped to below
1 with SD measures in place6. A R0 = 2.81 indicates that Brazil has not controlled the COVID19 pandemic. In fact, Brazil is the new virus hot spot with the highest infection and death counts
in Latin America, with the State of São Paulo considered one of the main hotspot6. São Paulo
is the most poulous state in Brazil with over 46 million inhabitants. Therefore, exploring
alternative SD intervention strategies for Brazil in general and São Paulo specifically is of
utmost importance.
Several factors may lead to differences in intervention strategies on COVID-19
infection and death rates for São Paulo, Brazil compared to other states and countries. For
example, research has indicated the older adults (60+) are at the greatest risk of experiencing
complications from COVID-197. Given that Brazil has a large percentage of its population over
the age of 60 years, especially in urban areas such as São Paulo, the incidence of aggravated
cases may be particularly high in comparison to places with younger population
demographics8. It has also been debated whether environmental conditions influence the

3

behavior of the COVID-19 virus similar to the common cold and flu9,10. Yet, the majority of
the research investigating the virus has been conducted in environments different/opposite than
that of Brazil and other areas in the southern hemisphere. In addition, Brazil faces many
economical and sociocultural challenges that may affect mitigation strategies differently than
cities, states, and/ or countries that are the current focus of most prediction models8. Therefore,
the purpose of the current investigation is to model COVID-19 SD intervention strategies on
transmission dynamics in São Paulo, Brazil and to determine best-case scenarios.
Results
Our model was able to accurately fit the corrected accumulated cases and deaths data for Brazil
and São Paulo (Figure 1). On the day of the analysis (May 11, 2020), SD was estimated at 41%
in Brazil and 52% in São Paulo and protection was 59% in Brazil and 60% in São Paulo. All
optimized coefficients, as well as the latent period, infectious period, hospitalized period, ICU
period estimated from the model can be found in Table 1.
Considering the size of the country and that many regions are facing different stages of
the pandemic, we concentrate further analyses in the state of São Paulo. The results suggest
that the optimal strategy was the stepping down strategy (Figure 2a,b) and optimal time window
was 80 days (Figure 2c). The results suggest that by constraining SD and protection levels to
realistic ranges (30 to 70% and 50 to 70% respectively), optimal solutions regarding strategies
and time window to contain the first and second peak of the pandemic converge confirming
the optimal strategy (Figure 2b) and window (Figure 2c) that can be observed in (Figure 2a)
Optimal solution for São Paulo
Considering keeping the current SD and protection values and the optimal strategy and
time window it would be possible to contain the first peak in the pandemic but not the second
(Figure 1e); unless, at least the current SD were kept indefinitely. Considering scenarios where
SD would eventually either drop or oscillate, optimal strategy and optimal time window

4

suggest that critical cases over ICU threshold would be approximately 20 thousand; at 80-day
windows stepping strategy would cause approximately a 90 thousand decrease in the number
of critical cases over ICU threshold in comparison to the intermittent strategy and 90 thousand
compared to the constant SD strategy. Additionally, considering the stepping strategy, an 80day window would cause approximately 70 thousand decrease in the number of critical cases
over ICU threshold compared to a 40-day window and 30 thousand compared to a 60-day
window. Our results indicate that keeping protection as it is now, a lock-down scenario of
SD=75% for the next 60 days followed, by a 40-day window lock-down stepping strategy,
would contain the first peak of the pandemic and cause a significant drop in the total number
of cases for the till October 2020; however, if protection level drops with time it may have
cause a second large peak.
Nevertheless, the results suggest that by keeping current SD, increasing protection by
10%, and using optimal strategy and time windows between 60-80 days, it is possible to contain
the first peak and second peaks of the pandemic in São Paulo (Figure 1f). After a 60 days
period, a reduction in average SD across the reminder of the pandemic with 60-80-day windows
steeping strategy would cause approximately a 30 thousand decrease in the number of critical
cases over ICU threshold in comparison to the 80-day window intermittent strategy and 100
thousand compared to the constant SD strategy. Additionally, considering the stepping
strategy, either a 60-80-day window would cause approximately 40 thousand decrease in the
number of critical cases over ICU threshold compared to a 40-day window.
Finally, considering increasing protection by 10% but having a drop in SD from 52%
to 40%, optimal strategy and optimal time window suggest that critical cases over ICU
threshold would be approximately 30 thousand; at 80-day windows stepping strategy would
cause approximately a 11 thousand decrease in the number of critical cases over ICU threshold
in comparison to the intermittent strategy and 100 thousand compared to the constant SD

5

strategy (Figure 1g). Additionally, considering the stepping strategy, an 80-day window would
cause approximately 50 thousand decrease in the number of critical cases over ICU threshold
compared to a 40-day window and 15 thousand compared to a 60-day window.
Discussion
We used a SUEIHCDR compartmental model to project thousands of scenarios for the
transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in São Paulo, Brazil through the next two years. We
used advanced algorithms to model scenarios related to strategy type, SD magnitude, time
window, and level of personal protection. The goal was to determine the best-case scenario to
control the current peak of infections and avoid a second pandemic wave.
Controlling first peak
Currently, Brazil has the highest rate of transmission in the world with an estimated R0
of 2.816, indicating that it has yet to contain the first peak in infections and associated deaths
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from around the world (e.g., Asia, Europe, and North
America) indicate that it is possible to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 with widespread SD
and PPM measures3. However, our analysis of location data11,12 indicate that the current level
of SD is at only 42% for Brazil and for 52% São Paulo. In addition, the current protection
values are 60% for the state and 69% for the country. Not only does our model indicate that
current SD and protection values are insufficient in controlling the pandemic, they will have
dire consequences on the overall number of infections and associated deaths with an extremely
large first peak. In addition, our model suggest that this will result in the need of public health
resources, especially ICU, exceeding what is currently available. With the current levels of SD
and protection, our model predicts that the ICU needed will surpass the available ICU in Sao
Paulo at the first drop of SD levels, unless protection increases (Figure 1). The scenario may
be even worse because not all ICU beds available are exclusively dedicated to covid-19 patients
and because some cities may experience the health-care system failure before others.

6

According to our model, it is possible for the state of São Paulo to gain control over the
first peak if levels of personal protection are significantly increases (at least 10%).
Alternatively, an immediately increase SD to values over 75% may solve the problem of the
first peak as well. However, increasing SD to values in 75% may result in a second peak if the
restrictions are lifted within 40days. SD at 75% represents a complete lock down13. Thus, such
a strategy should be used with caution. Further, it should only be used in critical cities and not
the State as a whole. Our model suggest that if this high-level of SD is used, it is only necessary
for a short time (until end of June 2020).
Note, however, that lower levels of SD will need to be in place for years to come to
maintain control over the pandemic14,15. Widespread use of PPM (e.g., wearing facemasks,
frequently washing hands, using hand sanitizer, maintaining physical distance between other
people, and avoiding agglomerations) and high rates of testing have been emphasized to
mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in addition to SD15-19. The results of our model agree; our
model indicates that an increase in personal protection to a level of 70% for São Paulo in
combination with SD is necessary to contain the concurrent peak in infections and associated
deaths. Eikenberry et al. (2020) estimated that the efficacy of using face masks ranges between
50 to 90%, depending upon mask material and fitting20. They assumed that at least 50%
protection factor would be achievable for well-made and well-fitted mask usage by the entire
population20. The fitting of our model predicts that current level of protection is about 60%.
An increase in protection levels would need a massive effort by public health officials to
enforce and/or educate people to use facemask and to maintain a 2 meters safe distance from
other people. Note, some Brazilian cities have implemented strict SD guidelines and require
some level of personal protection19. For example, Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador
require facemasks in public21. São Paulo recently announced they will require facemask as
well.

Avoiding a second peak
Assuming that Brazil can effectively reduce R0 below 1 with SD and personal
protection, it is important to take steps to reduce the likelihood of a second peak. Our models
indicate that if SD and personal protection measures are stopped too soon or reduced too much
after the containment of the first peak, a second peak in infections and associated deaths will
occur. Many experts agree that a secondary pandemic wave is likely if SD restrictions are lifted
too quickly22,23. Therefore, determining when and how to relax restrictions has become the
focus of epidemiological work around the world. It has been proposed that a responsible exit
strategy should continue SD restrictions alongside widespread testing and contract tracing24.
Laboratory testing to confirm COVID-19 exposure and/or diagnosis has been a major obstacle
for the mitigation efforts worldwide. Unfortunately, testing efforts in Brazil have been
deficient. Brazil has conducted the least COVID-19 tests per capita worldwide
(https://www.worldbank.org/). In addition, reports indicate that Brazil uses substandard testing
kits and only tracks hospitalized cases (https://p.dw.com/p/3cBQi). The lack of data for contact
tracing in Brazil suggest efforts are insufficient as well.
Nevertheless, our models suggest it is possible for Brazil, considering São Paulo as a
model state, to avoid a second peak. According to our results, the best-case exit strategy to
prevent a second peak in São Paulo was a stepping-down strategy over a two-year period. A
stepping-down approach would involve a gradual stair-step down. For example, the steppingdown approach we modeled multiplied SD values of 40%, 30% and 20% by 1, then 1/2, then
1/4, then 1/8 and then back to 1 and the we repeated each stair-step down. A stepping-down
strategy was also the best-case exit strategy modeled for the US15. A stepping-down approach
may be beneficial because it allows for periods of transmission leading to heard immunity
without overwhelming public health resources14,25. Alternatively, a one-time SD may result in

8

a catastrophic second peak (Figure 1, yellow curve), if the virus reoccurred and not enough
people have immunity14,25. In addition, the stepping-down approach resulted in a 6.5%
reduction in total time required to SD over the two-year period, potentially reducing the
economic and social costs associated with SD.
The results of the current investigation suggest that an 80-day window between each
step was the most beneficial strategy. This result is also consistent with that for the US15. Note,
however, the current investigation modeled more time windows and more complex algorithms
than the US model. In addition, the best-case stepping-down strategy with an 80-day windows
was a magnitude of SD of at least 50%, in the highest windows, or approximately 24% average
through the period of analysis. Furthermore, the results suggest that higher protective measures
could account for lower SD values, which may be associated with economic and/or
psychological benefits. Alternatively, higher SD values delay the onset of the second peak.
Delaying the onset of the peak may allow Brazil to procure additional public resources and
more time for the development of effective treatments or even a vaccine.
The minimum protection rate for this scenario was 70% for São Paulo. If protection
rates are maintained at these levels the models suggest that a second peak would be avoided.
However, if protection drops, a second peak would occur and would cross the threshold for
available public resources with perhaps devastating consequences. Mortality rates associated
with COVID-19 may rise when hospitals become overwhelmed and have fewer resources to
treat patients with life-threatening symptoms (https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/coronavirus).
This result provides additional support for the notion that personal protection is critical for
maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic15-19.

We

extended

a

Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered

(SEIR)

compartmental model using factors specific to COVID-1926,27 to investigate the COVID-19
pandemic in the US. It is composed of eight compartments: Susceptible, Unsusceptible,
Exposed, Infected, Hospitalized, Critical, Dead, and Recovered (SUEIHCDR) (Figure 1).
The SUEIHCDR model assumes that as time progresses, a susceptible person out of the
population (Npop) (Equation 1) can either become unsusceptible (Equation 2) considering a
protection rate (α; Equation 9; [23]) or exposed (Equation 3) to the virus considering social
distancing (SD) and an infection rate (β). This protection rate was introduced to account for
possible decreases in the number of susceptible people to the virus caused by factors other than
social distancing such as the use of facemasks and hand washing. Exposed people become
infectious after an incubation time of 1/γ (Equation 4). Infected people stay infected for a period
of 1/δ and can recover with no medical attention (m) or can be hospitalized (1-m). Hospitalized
people (Equation 5) stay hospitalized for 1/ζ days and can either recover (1-c) or become
critical (c) needing to go to an Intensive care unit (ICU). A person stays on average 1/ ε in the
ICU (Equation 6) and can either go back to the hospital (1-f) or die (f; Equation 7). Recovered
people (Equation 8) can come from infection (m) or from the hospital (1-c).

where 𝛼0 is the maximum or minimum possible value for a window of time and 𝑡𝑓 is the final
time of the window. Alpha was optimized considering the window of time from the beginning
of the pandemic until present day, and it was manipulated afterwards in different windows of
time to project possible future scenarios. Changes in α causes changes in the number of people
that are unsusceptible to the disease at a given time; we exhibit alpha manipulations as the
percentage ratio of the unsusceptible or protected people over the country’s population (i.e.
Protection (%)). Note, that insusceptibility in our model accounts for the time-dependent state
of an individual or behavior that can take someone from susceptibility to insusceptibility or the
other way around.
Furthermore, social distancing until present day was determined from mobility trends
data from Apple Maps11 and community mobility reports from Google12. Data were low-pass
filter filtered at 0.09 Hz (Butterworth 4th order), and percentage changes from baseline were
considered (Apple’s driving data was averaged with Google’s retail and recreation, grocery
and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, and workplaces average percent change from baseline.
From present day forward SD was manipulated in different windows of time to project possible
future scenarios.
Solving and testing the model
We used the fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical method to solve our system of
ordinary differential equation in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc.R14a).

Model’s Coefficients Optimization
We used both accumulated case and deaths time series to fit the model, both corrected
by a factor (Table 1). Cases sub-test factor was calculated as the ratio between the death rate
in Iceland (country with the greatest percentage of test per inhabitant28), corrected by age
stratification (older adults (60+): 6.4%; senior older adults (80+): 13.4%29). Death sub-factor
was determined comparing data from deaths in the last months to average deaths in the same
period from past 5 years30-32. The resulting sub-factor was similar to that reported by other
sources (https://www.ft.com/content/6bd88b7d-3386-4543-b2e9-0d5c6fac846c).
Fitting analysis was done with a custom build MATLAB global optimization algorithm
using Monte Carlo iterations and multiple local minima searches (Figure 1). The algorithm was
tested for the best solution considering all inputs varying within ranges obtained from the
WHO33 and several publications34-36(Table 1). Infected initial values (I0) were determined
from corrected accumulated cases as well as initial death values (D0). Other initial values were
set proportional to I0 considering model parameters (m, c, f); all initial parameters could vary
during optimization as well (Table 1). Data’s start date was Feb 25, 2020, and end date was
Dec 25, 2021. Data under 500 active cases were discarded. Data under 500 active cases were
discarded. A Confidence Interval of 95% was estimated using Monte Carlo for a 2% error for
all coefficients used to evaluate the confidence in the model results, to test if future projected
scenarios were statistically different at a 5% level, and to compare model results to actual ICU
numbers (Figure 1). Note confidence interval projected lines were not included in all the figures
for clarity. Model results were based on an average of 5000 runs. Peak ICU estimations were

Future Projections
After model’s coefficient were fitted an optimization workflow using ESTECO’s mode
Frontier (Esteco s.p.a; 2017R4-5.6.0.1) was implemented to find the optimal mitigation
strategy out of the proposed here could be identified. Future scenarios considered changes in
SD and protection staring June 1st, 2020. First, we run a DOE (Design of Experiment) scheme
of around 1000 SOBOL individuals and 1000 Latin Hypercube individuals created by varying
maximum SD values per window within 0-75% and protection percentage between 20-95%.
Then data was constrained considering more realistic ranges of SD and protection (30 to 70%
and 50 to 70%, respectively) (complete optimization analysis can be found in the
supplementary file). We propose 3 strategies of mitigation (Figure 2): 1) a stepping- down
strategy (starting at a specific SD, it is divided by half for the next 3 time windows, on the
fourth time window SD is back to its initial value, and the process is repeated); 2) a standard
intermittent SD strategy (a specific SD value alternates with periods of no SD); and 3) a
constant SD strategy (SD is kept constant at as specific value); with each strategy considering
three different times windows: 40, 60 or 80 days (Figure 3). Furthermore, strategies were
compared using similar average SD across time; note however, that for because of its design
when intermittent and stepping down strategies have the same maximum SD, and when
adopting half of this values for the constant SD strategy, average SD values across time tends
to be 6.25% smaller for the stepping-down strategy compared to the other two. A MOGA Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm was used to drive the optimization, due to the discrete
nature of the Variables Strategy and Window. We minimize the number of critical cases over
ICU threshold (ICU_E) for the duration of the analysis, the number of critical cases over ICU
threshold in the first peak of the pandemic (ICUE_1), the number of critical cases over ICU
threshold in the second peak of the pandemic (ICUE_2) and SD.

Figure 1: Fitting results for corrected accumulated cases and deaths Brazil (a,b) and for São
Paulo (c,d) with a 95% confidence interval and representative results for intensity care units
bed occupancy per day (ICU_PD; i.e. critical cases). e) shows 8 different cases with protection
kept at current state level of 60%.; for the first 6 scenarios SD is kept at current levels
(SD=52%) during the high SD window; scenarios 7 and 8, SD is constant at 26% and 52%.
Finally, the last scenario (yellow) shows a 75% SD (lockdown) with stepping strategy with 40day windows; f) show similar scenarios but with 70% protection; g) show 70% protection and
40% SD; h) show changes in SD through time.
Figure 2: Optimization results for state of São Paulo showing the influence of strategy (a,b)
and window size (c) on the total number of critical cases over ICU threshold for the whole
period of analysis (end day Dec 25, 2021; ICU_E) and on the number of critical cases over
ICU threshold for the first (ICU_E1) and second peak of the pandemic (ICU_E2). Red color
indicate either constant SD strategy (a,b) or 80-day windows (c); green color indicates either
intermittent strategy (a,b) or 60-day windows (c); and blue color indicates either stepping down
strategy (a,b) or 80 day windows (c). Finally, protection percentages can be seen in a, and social
distance (SD) are shown ranging from 15-40% by the diameters of the circles in b and c.
Figure 3: Illustration of the influence of strategy (stepping down, intermittent, and constant)
and of different time windows (40, 60, and 80 days) on the model results for active cases per
day (a,i), total ICU beds per day (b,j), hospitalizations per day (c,k), accumulative deaths (d,l),
accumulative cases (e,m), accumulative recuperated cases (f,n), as well as social distancing
(SD) strategies (g,o), and protection percentage (h,p) for São Paulo. Mean SD was similar
among all cases (26%) and protection was either 65 or 60%.
Figure 4: Illustration of the influence of different mean social distance (13, 26, and 52%) and
different protection percentages (65, 60, and 55%) on the model results for active cases per day
(a,i), total ICU beds per day (b,j), hospitalizations per day (c,k), accumulative deaths (d,l),
accumulative cases (e,m), accumulative recuperated cases (f,n), as well as social distancing
(SD) strategies (g,o), and protection percentage (h,p) for São Paulo. SD were either 13, 26 or
52% with a 30% protection percentage and protection was either 55, 60 or 65% with a 52%
SD.
