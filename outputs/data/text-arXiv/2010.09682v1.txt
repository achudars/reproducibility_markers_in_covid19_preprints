Abstract
It is hard to overstate the importance of a timely prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic progression.
Yet, this is not possible without a comprehensive understanding of environmental factors that may
affect the infection transmissibility. Studies addressing parameters that may influence COVID-19
progression relied on either the total numbers of detected cases and similar proxies (which are highly
sensitive to the testing capacity, levels of introduced social distancing measures, etc.), and/or a small
number of analyzed factors, including analysis of regions that display a narrow range of these
parameters. We here apply a novel approach, exploiting widespread growth regimes in COVID-19
detected case counts. By applying nonlinear dynamics methods to the exponential regime, we extract
basic reproductive number R0 (i.e., the measure of COVID-19 inherent biological transmissibility),
applying to the completely naïve population in the absence of social distancing, for 118 different
countries. We then use bioinformatics methods to systematically collect data on a large number of
demographics and weather parameters from 118 world countries, and seek their correlations with the
rate of COVID-19 spread. While some of the already reported or assumed tendencies (e.g. negative
correlation of transmissibility with temperature and humidity, significant correlation with UV,
generally positive correlation with pollution levels) are also confirmed by our analysis, we report a
number of both novel results and those that help settle existing disputes: the absence of dependence on
wind speed and air pressure, negative correlation with precipitation; significant positive correlation
with society development level (human development index) irrespective of testing policies, and percent
of the urban population, but absence of correlation with population density per se. We find a strong
positive correlation of transmissibility on alcohol consumption, and the absence of correlation on
refugee numbers, contrary to some widespread beliefs. Significant tendencies with health-related
factors are reported, including a detailed analysis of the blood type group showing consistent
tendencies on Rh factor, and a strong positive correlation of transmissibility with cholesterol levels.
Detailed comparisons of obtained results with previous findings, and limitations of our approach, are
also provided.

Introduction

The ancient wisdom teaches us that "knowing your adversary" is essential in every battle - and this
equally applies to the current global struggle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the
parameters that influence the course of the pandemic is of paramount importance in the ongoing
worldwide attempts to minimize the devastating effects of the virus which, to the present moment, has
already taken a toll of more than a million lives [1], and resulted in double-digit recession among some
of the major world economies [2]. Of all such factors, the ecological ones (both abiotic such as
meteorological factors and biotic such as demographic and health-related population properties) likely
play a prominent role in determining the dynamics of disease progression [3].
However, making good estimates of the effects that general demographic, health-related, and weather
conditions, have on the spread of COVID-19 infection is beset by many difficulties. First of all, these
dependencies are subtle and easily overshadowed by larger-scale effects. Furthermore, as the effective
rate of disease spread is an interplay of numerous biological, medical, social, and physical factors, a
particular challenge is to differentiate the dominating effects of local COVID-19-related policies,
which are both highly heterogeneous and time-varying, often in an inconsistent manner. And this is
precisely where, in our view, much of the previous research on this subject falls short.
There are not many directly observable variables that can be used to trace the progression of the
epidemics on a global scale (i.e. for a large number of diverse countries). The most obvious one - the
number of detected cases - is heavily influenced both by the excessiveness of the testing (which, in
turn, depends on non-uniform medical guidelines, variable availability of testing kits, etc.) and by the
introduced infection suppression measures (where the latter are not only non-homogeneous but are also
erratically observed [4]). Nevertheless, the majority of the research aimed to establish connections of
the weather and/or demographic parameters with the spread of COVID-19 seeks correlations exactly
with the raw number of detected cases [5-13]. For the aforementioned reasons, the conclusions reached
in this way are questionable. Other variables that can be directly measured, such as the number of
hospitalized patients or the number of COVID-19 induced deaths [14-16], again depend on many
additional parameters which are difficult to take into account: level of medical care and current hospital
capacity, advancements, and changing practices in treating COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of risk
groups, and even on the diverging definitions of when hospitalization or death should be attributed to
the COVID-19 infection. As such, these variables are certainly not suitable as proxies of the SARSCoV-2 transmissibility per se.
On the other hand, as we here empirically find (and as theoretically expected [17, 18]) the initial stage
of the COVID-19 epidemic (in a given country or area) is marked by a period of a nearly perfect
exponential growth in the number of cases, which typically lasts for about two weeks (based on our
analysis of the available data). One can observe widespread dynamical growth patterns for many
countries, with a sharp transition between exponential, superlinear (growth faster than linear), and
sublinear (growth slower than linear) regimes (see Fig. 2 below) – the last two representing a
subexponential growth. We here concentrate on the initial exponential period of the detected-case data,
characterizing the period before the control measures took effect, from which we can deduce the basic
reproduction number R0 [19], following a simple and robust mathematical (dynamical) model presented
here. R0 is a straightforward and important epidemiological parameter characterizing the inherent
biological transmissibility of the virus, in a completely naïve population, and the absence of social
distancing measures [20, 21]. To emphasize the absence of social distancing, the term R0,free is also
used, – for simplicity, we further denote R0  R0, free . R0 is largely independent of the implemented
COVID-19 policies and thus truly reflects the characteristics of the disease itself, as it starts to spread
unhampered through the given (social and meteorological) settings. Namely, the exponential period

COVID-19 Environmental Dependence
ends precisely when the effect of control measures kick in, which happens with a delay of ~10 days
after their introduction [22], corresponding to the disease latent period, and to the time between the
symptom onset and the disease confirmation. Not only that very few governments had enacted any
social measures before the occurrence of a substantial number of cases [4], but also the length of the
incubation period makes likely that the infection had been already circulating for some time through
the community even before the first detected case (and that the effects of the measures are inescapably
delayed in general). Also, the transition from the exponential to the subsequent subexponential phase
of the epidemics is readily visible in the COVID data (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, R0 is invariant to the
particular testing guidelines, as long as these do not significantly vary over the (here relatively short)
studied period.
In the analysis presented here, we consider 42 different weather, demographic, and health-related
population factors, whose analyzed ranges correspond to their variations exhibited in 118 world
countries. While some authors prefer more coherent data samples to avoid confusing effects of too
many different factors [5-8, 11, 16], this consideration is outweighed by the fact that large ranges of
the analyzed parameters serve to amplify the effects we are seeking to recognize and to more reliably
determine the underlying correlations. For example, while the value of the Human Development Index
(HDI, a composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators) varies from
0.36 to 0.96 over the set of analyzed countries, this range would drop by an order of magnitude [23] if
the US was chosen as the scope of the study (other demographic parameters exhibit similar behavior).
The input parameters must take values in some substantial ranges to have measurable effects on R0 (i.e.
small variations may lead to effects which are easily lost in statistical fluctuations).
The number of considered parameters is also significant, especially when compared to other similar
studies [6-9, 11, 16, 24-26]. In a model where a large number of factors are analyzed under the same
framework, consistency of the obtained results, in terms of agreement with other studies, commonsense expectations, and their self-consistency, becomes an important check of applied methodology
and analysis. Furthermore, a comprehensive and robust analysis is expected to generate new findings
and lead to novel hypotheses on how environmental factors influence COVID-19 spread. Overall, we
expect that the understanding achieved here will contribute to the ability to understand the behavior of
the pandemics in the future and, by the same token, to timely and properly take measures in an attempt
to ameliorate the disease effects.

Model and parameter extraction

2.1

Modified SEIR model and relevant approximations

There are various theoretical models and tools used to investigate and predict the progress of an
epidemic [18, 19]. We here opted for the SEIR compartmental model, up to now used to predict or
explain different features of COVID-19 infection dynamics [27-31]. The model is sufficiently simple
to be applied to a wide range of countries while capturing all the features of COVID-19 progression
relevant for extracting the R0 values. The model assumes dividing the entire population into four
(mutually exclusive) compartments with labels: (S)usceptible, (E)xposed, (I)fected, and (R)ecovered.
The dynamics of the model (which considers gradual transitions of the population from one
compartment to the other) directly reflects the disease progression. Initially, a healthy individual has
no developed SARS-CoV-2 virus immunity and is considered as "susceptible". Through contact with
another infected individual, this person may become "exposed" - denoting that the transmission of the
virus has occurred, but the newly infected person at this point has neither symptoms nor can yet
transmit the disease. An exposed person becomes "infected" - in the sense of becoming contagious on average after the so-called "latent" period which is, in the case of COVID-19, approximately 3 days.
3

COVID-19 Environmental Dependence
After a certain period of the disease, this person ceases to be contagious and is then considered as
"recovered" (from the mathematical perspective of the model, "recovered" are all individuals who are
no longer contagious, which therefore also includes deceased persons). In the present model, the
recovered individuals are taken to be no longer susceptible to new infections (irrespectively of whether
the COVID-19 immunity is permanent or not, it is certainly sufficiently long in the context of our
analysis).
Accordingly, almost the entire population initially belongs to the susceptible class. Subsequently, parts
of the population become exposed, then infected, and finally recovered. SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is
characterized by a large proportion of asymptomatic cases (or cases with very mild symptoms) [32],
which leads to a large number of cases that remain undiagnosed. For this reason, only a portion of the
infected will be identified (diagnosed) in the population, and we classify them as "detected". This
number is important since it is the only direct observable in our model, i.e. the only number that can
be directly related to the actual COVID-19 data.

Figure 1: Diagrammatic representation of the SEIR model with the added class of “Detected” patients. Individuals move
(denoted by solid arrows) from Susceptible to Exposed to Infected to Recovered, with the rates indicated above arrows in
the figure. Some of the infected are detected (diagnosed/confirmed), indicated by the dashed arrow.

This dynamic is schematically represented in Fig. 1, and is governed by the following set of differential
equations:

(1.5. )

In the above equations, S, E, I, and R denote numbers of individuals belonging to, respectively,
susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered compartments, D is the number of detected cases, while
N is the total population. Parameter β denotes the transmission rate, which is proportional to the
probability of disease transmission in contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject.
Incubation rate σ determines the rate at which exposed individuals become infected and corresponds
to the inverse of the average incubation period. Recovery rate γ determines the transition rate between
infected and recovered parts of the population, (i.e. 1/γ is the average period during which an individual
is infectious). Finally, 𝜀 and 𝛿 are detection efficiency and the detection rate. All these rate parameters
are considered constant during the analyzed (brief) period.

In the first stage of the epidemic, when essentially the entire population is susceptible (i.e. S/N ≈ 1) and
no distancing measures are enforced, the average number of secondary infections, caused directly by
primary infected individuals, corresponds to the basic reproduction number R0. The infectious disease
can spread through the population only when R0 > 1, and in these cases, the initial growth of the infected
cases is exponential. Though R0 is a characteristic of the pathogen, it also depends on environmental
abiotic (e.g. local weather conditions), as well as biotic factors (e.g. prevalence of health conditions,
and population mobility tightly related to the social development level). In addition to R0, the
transmissibility is also expressed in terms of the effective reproduction number Re that also takes into
account the effects of the introduced social measures. Re is not considered in this work, as we are
concerned with the factors that affect the inherent biological transmissibility of the virus, independently
from the applied measures.
2.2

COVID-19 growth regimes

If we observe the number of total COVID-19 cases (e.g. in a given country) as a function of time, there
is a regular pattern that we observe: the growth of the detected COVID cases is initially exponential
but slows down after some time – when we say it enters the subexponential regime. The subexponential
regime can be further divided into the superlinear (growing asymptotically faster than a linear function)
and sublinear regime (the growth is asymptotically slower than a linear function). This typical behavior
is illustrated, in the case of Italy, in Fig. 2. The transition to the subexponential regime occurs relatively
soon, much before a significant portion of the population gains immunity, and is a consequence of the
introduction of the infection suppression measures.

superlinear (blue) and sublinear (green) regime. The three insets correspond to the log-linear scale (exponential), log-log

2.3

Inference of the basic reproduction number R0

In the initial exponential regime, a linear approximation to the model can be applied. Namely, in this
stage, almost the entire population is susceptible to the virus, i.e. S/N≈1, which simplifies the equation
(1.2) to:
𝑑𝐸
= − 𝜎𝐸 + 𝛽𝐼.
𝑑𝑡
By combining expressions (1.3.) and (3.1.) one obtains:
𝑑 𝐸

(3.2. )

where we have introduced a two-by-two matrix:
А= (

)
−𝛾

(3.3. )

The solution for the number of infected individuals can now be written:
𝐼(𝑡) = 𝐶1 ∗ 𝑒 𝜆+𝑡 + 𝐶2 ∗ 𝑒 𝜆−𝑡 ,

(3.4. )

where λ+ and λ- denote eigenvalues of the matrix А, i.e. the solutions of the equation:
det(𝐴 − 𝜆𝐼) = 0.

(3.5. )

The eigenvalues must satisfy:
|

−σ − λ
β
| = 0,
σ
−γ − λ

leading to:
(λ + σ) ∗ (λ + γ) − β ∗ σ = 0.

(3.6. )

The solutions of (3.6.) are:
−(𝛾 + 𝜎) ± √(𝛾 − 𝜎)2 + 4𝛽𝜎
(3.7. )
.

Since λ- < 0, the second term in (3.4) can be neglected for sufficiently large t. More precisely, numerical
analysis shows that this approximation is valid already after the second day, while, for the extraction
of R0 value we will anyhow ignore all data before the fifth day (for the analyzed countries, numbers of
cases before the fifth day were generally too low, hence this early data is dominated by stochastic
effects/fluctuations). Hence, 𝐼(𝑡) is proportional to 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝜆+ 𝑡), i.e.:
𝜆± =

I(t) = I(0) ∗ 𝑒 𝜆+𝑡 .

(3.8. )

By expressing β from (3.7) and inserting the formula into (1.6.), we obtain:
β
𝜆+ ∗ (𝛾 + 𝜎) + 𝜆+ 2
𝑅0 = = 1 +
.
γ
𝛾∗𝜎

(3.9. )

From (3.8.) and (1.5.) we compute:
D(t) = 𝜀 ∗ 𝛿 ∗ I(0) ∗

(𝑒 𝜆+𝑡 − 1)
.
𝜆+

(3.10. )

By taking the logarithm, the above expression leads to:

COVID-19 Environmental Dependence
log(D(t)) = log   I  0   + λ+ ∗ t,

(3.12. )

from which λ+ can be obtained as the slope of the log(D(t)) function. From equation (3.9.), we thus
obtain the R0 value as a function of the slope of log(D(t)), where the latter can be efficiently inferred
from the plot of the number of detected COVID-19 cases for a large set of countries.
The SEIR model and the above derivation of R0 assume that the population belonging to different
compartments is uniformly mixed. Possible heterogeneities may tend to increase R0 values [18].
However, this would not influence the results obtained below, as our R0 values are consistently inferred
for all analyzed countries by using the same model, methodology, and parameter set. Moreover, our R0
values are in agreement with the prevailing estimates in the literature [33].
2.4

Demographic and weather data acquisition

For the countries for which R0 was determined through the procedure above, we also collect a broad
spectrum of meteorological and demographic parameter values. Overall, 118 countries were selected
for our analysis, based on the relevance of the COVID-19 epidemiological data. Namely, a country
was considered as relevant for the analysis if the number of detected cases on June 15th was higher
than a threshold value of 1000. A few countries were then discarded from this initial set, where the
case count growth was too irregular to extract any results, possibly due to inconsistent or irregular
testing policies. As a source for detected cases, we used [34].
In the search for factors correlated with COVID-19 transmissibility, we have analyzed overall 42
parameters, 11 of which are related to weather conditions, 30 to demographics or health-related
population characteristics, and one parameter quantifying a delay in the epidemic's onset.
Our main source of weather data was project POWER (Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources)
of the NASA agency [35]. A dedicated Python script was written and used to acquire weather data via
the provided API (Application Programming Interface). NASA project API allows a large set of
weather parameters to be obtained for any given location (specified by latitude and longitude) and
given date/time combination. Since we needed to assign a single value to each country (for each
analyzed parameter), the following method was used for averaging meteorological data. In each
country, a number of largest cities1 were selected and weather data was taken for the corresponding
locations. This data was then averaged, weighted by the population of each city. Also, data were
averaged over the period used for R0 estimation. (More precisely, to account for the time between
disease transmission and the case confirmation, we shifted this period 12 days into the past.) The only
meteorological parameter not available from the NASA POWER project was the information on UV
(ultra-violet) radiation, which was obtained from the OpenUV source [www.openuv.io], using the
same averaging methodology.
Demographic data was collected from several sources. Percentage of the urban population, refugees,
net migration, social and medical insurance coverage, infant mortality, and disease (CVD, cancer,
diabetes, CRD) risk was taken from the World Bank organization [36]. The HDI was taken from the
Our World in Data source [37], while median age information was obtained from the CIA website. The
source of most of the considered medical parameters: cholesterol, raised blood pressure, obesity,
inactivity, BSG vaccination as well as data on alcohol consumption and smoking prevalence was World
Health Organization [38]. Data for blood types were taken from the Wikidata web site. BUCAP

parameter, representing population density in the built-up area, was taken from GHS Urban Centre
Database 2015 [39]. The onset parameter, determining the delay (in days) of the epidemic's start, was
inferred from COVID-19 counts data. We used the most recent available data for all the parameters.

The log(D(t)) function, for a subset of selected countries, is shown in Fig. 3. The obvious linear
dependence confirms that the progression of the epidemic in this stage is almost perfectly exponential.
For each country, the parameter 𝜆+ is directly obtained as the slope of the corresponding linear fit of
the log(D(t)), and the basic reproduction number R0 is then calculated from Equation (3.9).
Here, we used the following values for the incubation rate, σ = 1/3 day-1, and for the recovery rate γ
=1/4 day-1, per the commonly accepted values in the literature [20]. Note that possible variations in
these two experimental values would not significantly affect any conclusions about R0 correlations,
due to the mathematical properties of the relation (3.9): it is a strictly monotonous function of 𝜆+ and
the linear term 𝜆+ ∗ (𝛾 + 𝜎)/𝛾 ∗ 𝜎 dominantly determines the value of R0.
Supplementary tables contain the values for 42 variables, for all countries. Correlations of each of the
variables with R0 are given in Table 2. Values for the Pearson correlation coefficient are further shown
below, though consistent conclusions are also obtained by Kendall and Spearman correlation
coefficients (which do not assume a linear relationship between variables).

Figure 4: A) R0 vs HDI as an example of transmissibility dependence on demographic data (Pearson correlation denoted
as R). B) Pearson correlations of R0 with (from left to right): social security and health insurance coverage (INS), percentage
of urban population (UP), BUCAP measure of population density (BAP), median age (MA), infant mortality (IM), net
migration (I-E), and percentage of refugee population by country or territory of asylum (RE). The statistical significance
of each correlation is indicated in the legend, while “ns” stands for “no significance”.

The first set of results that corresponds to, roughly speaking, general demographic data, is presented
in Fig. 4. The plot in panel A shows the distribution of R0 vs. HDI values for all countries, where a
higher HDI score indicates the more prosperous country concerning life expectancy, education, and
per capita income [40]. This parameter was included in the study due to a reasonable expectation that
a higher level of social development also implies a higher level of population interconnectedness and
mixing (stronger business and social activity, more travelers, more frequent contacts, etc.), and hence
that HDI could be related to the SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. Indeed, we note a strong, statistically
highly significant correlation between the HDI and the R0 value, with R = 0.37, and p=410-5,
demonstrating that the initial expansion of COVID-19 was faster in more developed societies.
The social security and health insurance coverage (INS) “shows the percentage of population
participating in programs that provide old age contributory pensions (including survivors and
disability) and social security and health insurance benefits (including occupational injury benefits,
paid sick leave, maternity, and other social insurance)” [36]. Reflecting the percentage of the
9

COVID-19 Environmental Dependence
population covered by medical insurance and likely feeling more protected from the financial effects
of the epidemics, this indicator shows a strong (R = 0.4) and highly significant (p = 410-4) positive
correlation with R0. The percentage of urban population (UP) and BUCAP density (BAP) are both
included as measures of how concentrated is the population of the country. While the UP value simply
shows what percentage of the population lives in cities, the BUCAP parameter denotes the amount of
the built-up area per person. Of the two, the former shows a highly significant positive correlation with
the COVID-19 basic reproduction number, whereas the latter shows no correlation. Median age (MA)
should be of obvious potential relevance in COVID-19 studies since it is well known that the disease
more severely affects the older population [41]. Thus we wanted to investigate also if there is any
connection of age with the virus transmissibility. Our results are suggestive of such a connection, since
we obtained a strong positive correlation of age with R0, with very high statistical confidence. Infant
mortality (IM) is defined as the number of infants dying before reaching one year of age, per 1,000 live
births. Lower IM rates can serve as another indicator of the prosperity of a society, and it turns out that
this measure is also strongly correlated, but negatively, with R0 and p = 810-5 (showing again that more
developed countries, i.e. those with lower IM rates, have experienced more rapid spread of the virus
infection). Net migration (I-E) represents the five-year estimates of the total number of immigrants less
the annual number of emigrants, including both citizens and noncitizens. This number, related to the
net influx of foreigners, turns out to be positively correlated, in a statistically significant way, with R0.
However, according to our data, the percentage of refugees, defined as the percentage of the people in
the country who are legally recognized as refugees and were granted asylum in that country, is not
correlated with R0 at all.
Another set of parameters corresponds to medically-related demographic parameters and is shown in
the upper part of Fig. 5. The plot in panel A represents the average blood cholesterol level (in mmol/L)
in the population of various countries, plotted against the value of R0. The two parameters are strongly
correlated, with R = 0.4, and p=610-6. Another demographic parameter with clear medical relevance,
that has a comparatively strong and significant positive correlation with R0, is the alcohol consumption
per capita (ALC), as shown in panel B of Fig. 5. Our data shows that R0 is also positively correlated,
with high statistical significance, with the prevalence of obesity and to a somewhat smaller extent with
the percentage of smokers. Here, obesity is defined as having a body-mass index over 30. A medical
parameter which is strongly, but negatively, correlated with R0, is a measure of prevalence and severity
of COVID-19 relevant chronic diseases in the population (CD). This parameter is defined as “the
percent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th birthday from any of cardiovascular
disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current
mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death” [36]. The percentage
of people with raised blood pressure (RBP) is also negatively correlated with R0, though this correlation
is not as strong and as statistically significant as in the case of the CD parameter. Here, raised blood
pressure is defined as systolic blood pressure over 140 or diastolic blood pressure over 90, in the
population older than 18. The percentage of smokers exhibits exhibit statistically significant (though
not large) positive correlation. Two medical-demographic parameters that show no correlation with R0
in our data are the prevalence of insufficient physical activity among adults aged over 18 (IN) and BCG
immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (BCG).
In Fig. 5C we see that blood types are, in general, strongly correlated with R0. The highest positive
correlation is exhibited by A- and O- types, with a Pearson correlation of 0.4 and 0.39, and a very high
statistical significance of p = 10-4 and p = 210-4, respectively. Taken as a whole, group A is still strongly
and positively correlated with R0, albeit with a bit lower statistical significance (A+ type correlation
has p-value two orders of magnitude higher than A-). This is not so for group O that, overall, does not
seem to be correlated to R0 (O+ even shows a certain negative correlation but without statistical
significance). Our data reveals a highly significant positive correlation also for AB- subtype (R = 0.31,

p = 0.003), while neither the AB+ subtype nor overall AB group is significantly correlated with the
basic reproduction number. Clear negative correlation is exhibited only by B blood group (R = -0.31,
p = 0.004), mostly due to the negative correlation of its B+ subtype (R = -0.34, p = 0.001), whereas Bsubtype is not significantly correlated with R0 in our data. If we consider the rhesus factor alone, we
again observe very strong correlations with R0 and with very high statistical significance: Rh- and Rh+
correlate positively (R = 0.4) and negatively (R = -0.4), respectively, with very high statistical
significance (p = 210-4). The tendency of Rh- to increase the transmissibility, and of Rh+ to decrease
it, is therefore consistent with the results obtained for all four individual blood-groups.

motivation was to check for a possible correlation between the delay in the onset of the epidemic and
the rate at which it spreads. Indeed, our data shows that such correlation exists and that it is very strong
and statistically significant: R = -0.48 and p = 410-8. In other words, the later the epidemic started, the
lower (on average) is the basic reproduction number.

statistically significant correlation with R0.
Next, we consider weather factors. Panels C and D of Fig. 6 show correlations of precipitation,

R0. Of these, precipitation, temperature, specific humidity, and UV index show a very strong negative

correlation, at a very high level of statistical significance. Of the other two parameters, air pressure
also shows signs of negative correlation but with no statistical significance, while the wind speed is
not correlated at all with R0 in our data.

Discussion

The present paper aimed to establish relations between the COVID-19 transmissibility and a large
number of demographic and weather parameters. As a measure of COVID-19 transmissibility, we have
chosen the basic reproduction number R0 – a quantity that is essentially independent of the variations
in both the testing policies and the introduced social measures (as discussed in the Introduction), in
distinction to many studies on transmissibility that relied on the total number of detected case counts
(see e.g. [5-13). We have covered a substantial number of demographic and weather parameters,
included in our analysis all world countries that were significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic
(and had a reasonable consistency in tracking the early phase of infection progression). While a number
of manuscripts have been devoted to factors that may influence COVID-19 progression, only a few
used an estimate of R0 or some of its proxies [42-44] - these studies were however limited to China,
and included a small set of meteorological variables, with conflicting results obtained for their
influence on R0. Therefore, a combination of i) using a reliable and robust measure of COVID-19
transmissibility, and ii) considering a large number of factors that may influence this transmissibility
within the same study/framework, distinguishes our study over prior work. We, however, must be
cautious when it comes to further interpretation of the obtained data. As always, we must keep in mind
that "correlation does not imply causation" and that further research is necessary to identify possible
confounding factors and establish which of these parameters truly affect the COVID-19
transmissibility. Due to the sheer number of studied variables, an even larger number of parameters
that might be relevant but are inaccessible to study (or even impossible to quantify), as well as due to
possible intricate mutual relations of the factors that may influence COVID-19 transmission, this is a
highly nontrivial task. While we postpone any further analysis in this direction to future studies, we
will, nevertheless, consider here the possible interpretations of the obtained correlations, assuming that
they also probably indicate the existence of at least some causation.
We will first consider the demographic variables presented in Fig. 4. The obtained correlation of the
human development index (HDI) with the basic reproduction number is both strong and hardly
surprising. The level of prosperity and overall development of a society is necessarily tied with the
degree of population mobility and mixing, traffic intensity (in particular air traffic), business and social
activity, higher local concentrations of people, and other factors that directly or indirectly increase the
frequency and range of personal contacts [45], rendering the entire society more vulnerable to the
spread of viruses. In this light, it is reasonably safe to assume that the obtained strong and highly
statistically significant correlation of HDI with R0 reflects a truly causal connection. However, some
authors offer also a different explanation: that higher virus transmission in more developed countries
is a consequence of more efficient detection of COVID-19 cases due to the better-organized health
system [45] – but since our R0 measure does not depend on detection efficiency, presented results can
be taken as evidence against such hypothesis.
The interpretation is less clear for other demographic parameters, for example, the percentage of the
population covered by medical and social insurance programs (INS). Besides, we are not aware of any
previous study of such a variable in the context of COVID-19. One possibility is to attribute the
statistically significant strong positive correlation of this parameter with R0 to a hypothetical tendency
of population to more easily indulge in the epidemiologically-risky behavior if they feel well-protected,
both medically and financially, from the risks posed by the virus; conversely, that the population that
cannot rely on professional medical care in the case of illness is likely to be more cautious not to
13

COVID-19 Environmental Dependence
contract the virus. Or, having in mind that the proportion of people covered by medical and social
insurance is generally (though not necessarily) associated with the level of social development, this
correlation may be non-causal and simply reflect the already established connection of the HDI with
the dynamics of the disease progression. The latter is most probably the case with the infant mortality
(IM), where low mortality ratios point to a better medical system, which goes hand in hand with the
overall prosperity and development of the country [46] – explaining in this way the observed negative
correlation with R0.
We are faced with a similar dilemma in the case of median age (MA). The strong positive correlation
of virus transmission with the median age of the population can be again interpreted as an indirect
consequence of the connection of this parameter with the level of development of the country since the
higher standard of living positively affects the life expectancy [45]. However, the same correlation can
be considered in the light of the fact that clinical and epidemiological studies have unanimously shown
that the elderly are at higher risk of developing a more severe clinical picture, and our result may
indicate that the virus also spreads more efficiently in the elderly population. A possible mechanism
responsible for higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 virus in the elderly population would be the far
greater number of chronic patients in this population who are prescribed certain drugs (ACE inhibitors
and angiotensin-receptor blockers) that lead to increased levels of ACE2 receptors through which the
SARS-CoV-2 virus can enter cells [47]. However, the weak correlation of virus transmission with the
percentage of smokers – in spite that tobacco users also have higher numbers of these receptors, as
well as the negative correlation with the prevalence of chronic diseases and high blood pressure, do
not speak in favor of such conclusion (see below). A general weakening of the immune system with
age may also be the reason for greater susceptibility to viral infections [48], and the positive correlation
we obtained could be partly due to a large number of elderly people grouped in nursing homes, where
the virus can expand very quickly [49].
The correlation of population density with R0, or the lack of thereof, is more challenging to explain.
Naively, one could expect that COVID-19 spreads much more rapidly in areas with a large
concentration of people, but, if exists, this effect is not that easily numerically captured. As the standard
population density did not show any correlation with the reproduction number R0 (not shown), we
explored some more subtle variants. Namely, the simplest reason why the data shows no correlation of
R0 with population density would be that the density, calculated in the usual way, is too averaged out:
the most densely-populated country on our list, Monaco, has roughly 10.000 times more people per
square kilometer than the least densely-populated Australia. However, Melbourne downtown has a
similar population density as Monaco and far more people, so one would expect no a priori reason that
its infection progression would be slower (and the R0 rate for Australia as a whole will be dominantly
determined by the fastest exponential expansion occurring anywhere on its territory). For this reason,
we included the BUCAP parameter into the analysis, which takes into account only population density
in built-up areas. Surprisingly, even this parameter did not exhibit any statistically significant
correlation. Several studies may serve as examples showing that the correlation of population density
with the rate of COVID-19 expansion can be expected only under certain conditions since the
frequency of contacts between people is to a large extent modulated by additional geographical,
economic, and sociological factors [50-53]. The observed absence of a correlation of the average
population density of the state, even in the case when only the inhabited part of its territory is taken
into consideration as with the BUCAP parameter, could be therefore expected and possibly indicates
that such a correlation should be sought at the level of smaller populated areas – for example, individual
cities [54]. This conclusion is somewhat supported by the obtained highly significant and strong
positive correlation of R0 with the percentage of the population living in cities (UP) and which probably
reflects the higher number of encounters between people in a more densely populated, urban
environment [10]. It is also possible that virus spread might have a highly non-linear dependence on

14

COVID-19 Environmental Dependence
the population density - namely, that an outbreak in a susceptible population requires a certain threshold
value of its density, while below that value population density ceases to be a significant factor
influencing virus [53, 55, 56].
Another demographic parameter that exhibits a significant correlation with R0 in our data is the net
migration (I-E), denoting the number of immigrants less the number of emigrants. Unlike this number,
which shows a positive correlation, the number of refugees (RE) seems not to be correlated at all. By
definition, migrants deliberately choose to move to improve their prospects, while refugees have to
move to save their lives or preserve their freedom. Migrants, arguably, tend to stay in closer contact
with the country of their origin and have more financial means for that, which likely contributes to
more frequent border crossings and more intensive passenger traffic [57], thereby promoting the
infection spread. Alternatively, since the migration is generally directed towards countries with higher
living standards, this correlation could be also seen as a consequence of the correlation of HDI.
However, any similar correlation is curiously absent in the case of refugees, who generally also migrate
towards developed countries. A possible interpretation is that since refugees are mostly stationed in
migrant camps, there is less possibility of spreading the virus outside through contacts with residents,
but there is a high possibility of escalation of the epidemic within camps with a high concentration of
people [58]. Additionally, since refugees usually migrate in large groups, there is less need for frequent
travel abroad to stay in contact with relatives, than in the case of (economic or academic) migrants. We
did not find any other attempt in the literature to examine this issue. In any case, our results demonstrate
that refugees are certainly not a primary cause of concern in the pandemics, contrary to fears expressed
in some media.
Of the medical factors, the strongest correlation of R0 is established with elevated cholesterol levels,
as shown in Fig. 5. Cholesterol may be associated with a viral infection and further disease
development through a complex network of direct and indirect effects. In vitro studies of the role of
cholesterol in virus penetration into the host body, done on several coronaviruses, indicate that its
presence in the lipid rafts of the cell membrane is essential for the interaction of the virus with the
ACE2 receptor, and also for the latter endocytosis of the virus [59]. Besides, it has been shown that
lowering cholesterol levels significantly reduces the ability of the virus to enter the cell. On the other
hand, elevated cholesterol is often related to obesity (OB) – another medical parameter that exhibits a
highly significant, strong correlation with R0. However, based on the levels of correlation alone – which
is stronger for elevated cholesterol than for the prevalence of obesity – it is not likely that the
explanation of cholesterol correlation with R0 should be sought in its relation with obesity, though the
interpretation in the opposite direction is not inconceivable: in principle, obesity might be a relevant
factor in COVID-19 epidemic exactly due to the effects of cholesterol on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.
Of course, other mechanisms of influence are also possible: it is known that obesity adversely affects
a person's immune system, among other things by the fact that the adipose tissue of obese people
excessively produces pro-inflammatory cytokines [60]. It is worth noting that, in developing countries,
an increase in population obesity comes as a consequence of the adoption of a lifestyle characteristic
of developed western countries, but obesity does not show a simple correlation with the state's
development [61] – precluding a simple explanation of the correlation via HDI as the confounding
variable. Overall, while the correlation of obesity with more severe prognosis in COVID-19 is well
established in the literature, its relation to COVID-19 transmissibility is only mentioned in [10] and
hitherto not explained.
Often related to obesity is also raised blood pressure (RBP), and we have discovered that this factor is
also correlated, at high statistical significance, with R0 – but this correlation turns out to be negative. .
It is interesting to note that this correlation supports the existing hypothesis about the beneficial effect
of ACE inhibitors and ARBs [62] (which are standardly used in the treatment of hypertension) in the
15

COVID-19 Environmental Dependence
dispute about their potential use in the fight against COVID-19. Namely, on the one hand, the use of
ACE inhibitors and ARBs upregulates ACE2 expression, which could hypothetically help the infection
of SARS-CoV-2 since the virus uses these receptors to enter cells. On the other, thanks to its antiinflammatory activity, ACE2 can alleviate tissue damage. Also, soluble ACE2 at increased
concentrations could bind SARS-CoV-2 particles and thereby reduce the titer of viruses available for
binding to tissue ACE2. These hypotheses have not been directly confirmed in COVID-19 patients,
but the harmful effect of ACE inhibitors and ARBs has not been proven so far [62, 63]. To our
knowledge, no previous findings are identifying high blood pressure as a predisposition factor for
getting infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus – it is only known that, based on clinical studies, RBP
appears to be a risk factor for hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 [62, 63]. Explanation of the
observed negative correlation might be sought in the relation of raised blood pressure with chronic
diseases that are known to be relevant for the COVID-19 outcome. Namely, our data show, at very
high statistical significance, a strong negative correlation of R0 with the risk of death from a batch of
chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease), agreeing
in this regard with some recent research [10, 64]. These diseases are identified as relevant comorbidities
in the context of COVID-19, leading to a huge increase in the severity of the infection and poorer
prognosis [65, 66] and, therefore, the discovered negative correlation comes as a surprise – particularly
when contrasted to the positive correlation of obesity (where both are recognized risk factors in
COVID-19 illness). One possible explanation is that the correlation may be due to potentially lower
mobility of people with chronic diseases compared to the general mobility of the population.
Additionally, it is possible that these people, being aware to belong to a high-risk group, behaved more
cautiously even before the official introduction of social distancing measures.
According to our analysis, the prevalence of certain health-hazard habits is also significantly correlated
to COVID-19 transmissibility. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption has, in general, a detrimental
effect on immunity to viral and bacterial infections, which, judging by the strong positive correlation
we obtained, most likely applies also to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. This correlation contradicts the
belief that alcohol can be used as a protective nostrum against COVID-19, which has spread in some
countries and even led to cases of alcohol poisoning [67].
Regarding the impact of smoking on SARS-CoV-2 virus infection – the results are controversial [68].
Smokers are at higher risk of developing a severe clinical picture of diseases caused by influenza
viruses and MERS, as well as other respiratory viral infections, so it can be assumed that this also
applies to COVID-19. This assumption is supported by the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters cells
by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, the number of which is significantly
increased in the lungs of smokers [69, 70]. On the other hand, there is a hypothesis that a weakened
immune response of smokers to virus infection may prove beneficial, as they would suffer less damage
to lung tissue due to inflammation caused by intense cytokine release that often accompanies a normal
immune response [71]. Statistical analyzes of clinical and epidemiological data have yielded
contradictory results, so it cannot be said what assumption is most robust [68]. The positive correlation
of smoking with COVID-19 transmissibility seems to be a novel result, and it supports the assumption
that the virus is transmitted more efficiently in populations with a higher percentage of smokers.
Another result that addresses the association of unhealthy lifestyle with greater susceptibility to SARSCoV-2 infection is the slight positive correlation we obtained for the prevalence of insufficient physical
activity (IN) in adults, which is however not statistically significant. In this sense, in the case of
COVID-19, we could not fully confirm the findings from [72], who found that physical activity
significantly reduces the risk of viral infections.
Despite the recent media interest [73], our findings neither could confirm that BCG immunization has
any beneficial effect in the case of COVID-19, at least as far as reducing the risk of contracting and

COVID-19 Environmental Dependence
transmitting the disease is concerned. While it is known that the BCG vaccine provides some protection
against various infectious agents, unfortunately, there is no clear evidence for such an effect against
SARS-CoV-2 [74]. Our analysis suggests that BCG immunization simply does not correlate with
SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission.
Some of the previous research has indicated that the blood type may influence the course of COVID19 illness. SARS-CoV-2 target cells are typically capable of synthesizing ABH antigens, which is why
the proteins from the viruses replicated in these cells can be tagged with an antigen of the appropriate
blood group. Interference of anti-A antibodies with the binding of a SARS-CoV-2 virus synthesized in
a cell expressing A antigen to the ACE2 receptor has been shown experimentally [75]. This can explain
the possible higher frequency of severe clinical picture in patients with A blood group [76], since in
these patients, on the one hand, viruses enter cells freely by binding to ACE2 receptors, and on the
other hand, these patients are generally characterized by the increased inflammatory activity of ACE
[77]. It is assumed that the same mechanism applies to anti-B antibodies, i.e. B antigens, which would
make people with blood type O most protected from exacerbation of COVID-19 disease [75]. While
the results of epidemiological studies on COVID-19 patients mostly support the proposed effect of
blood groups on the development of COVID-19 disease, the relationship between virus transmission
and blood group prevalence and Rh phenotype has been significantly less studied. Our analysis showed
strong positive correlations of virus transmission with the presence of A blood group and Rhphenotype, as well as strong negative correlations for B blood group and Rh+ phenotype, while for AB
and O blood group no significant correlations were obtained (Fig. 5C). This result coincides
significantly with the correlations obtained in a study conducted for 86 countries [78]. However,
another study focused on hospitalized patients in Turkey reported that the Rh+ phenotype represents a
predisposition to infection [79], contradicting our findings. Similar results regarding the Rh factor were
obtained in a study [80] on hospitalized patients in the US (this study further reported no correlation
of blood types with the severity of the disease). One way to reconcile these results with ours would be
to speculate that the virus is more efficiently transmitted in a population with a higher proportion of
Rh- phenotype because these people show a milder clinical picture compared to Rh+, so their movement
is not equally limited, which is why they have more ability to pass on the infection. It should be noted
that the average blood type in the country, similar to the average population density, may not accurately
reflect the population status in a particular region where the epidemic has spread, so additional research
is needed to more clearly establish the link between blood type and virus transmission.
Our data (Fig. 6A) shows a strong negative correlation with the date of the epidemic onset. Curiously,
it seems that the later the epidemic started in a given country, the slower disease expansion is more
likely. Instead of interpreting this result as an indication that the virus has mutated and changed its
properties in such a short period, we offer the following simpler explanation: pandemic reached first
those countries that are most interconnected with the rest of the world (at the same time, those are the
countries characterized by great mobility of people overall), so it is expected that also the progression
of the local epidemics in these countries is more rapid.
Another segment of our interest were air pollutants, shown in Fig. 6B. Air pollution can have a
detrimental effect on the human immune system and lead to the development (or to worsening) of the
respiratory diseases, including those caused by respiratory viral infections – as shown by numerous
previous studies, some of which were also experimental [81, 82]. Several papers have already
investigated air pollution in the context of COVID-19 and reported a positive correlation between the
death rate due to COVID-19 and the concentration of PM2.5 in the environment [83, 84]. Positive
correlations were also found for the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but mainly by considering daily
numbers of newly discovered cases – a method that, as we have already argued, may strongly depend
on testing policies, as well as on state measures to combat the epidemic [81]. As for the proposed
17

COVID-19 Environmental Dependence
mechanisms of interaction, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA can be adsorbed to airborne
particles and it has been suggested that in this state, under stable windless conditions, viruses could
spread over greater distances [85, 86]. However, an examination of air samples in Wuhan has indicated
little importance for this mechanism of virus transmission in the open, while the very opposite effects
should be expected indoors [87, 88]. This conclusion concurs with the results of a study in which no
correlation was obtained between the basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 infection for 154
Chinese cities and the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 particles, while the correlation of these factors
with the death rate (CFR) was shown [89]. The statistically insignificant and relatively weak
correlations we obtained for PM2.5 and PM10 pollutants also do not support the hypothesis of a
potentially significant role of these particles in the transmission of this virus. In contrast, significant
positive correlations were shown by our analysis for concentrations of NO2, SO2, and CO in the air
(although the correlation for CO is not statistically significant), which is generally supported by the
results of other studies. For example, a positive correlation of NO2 levels with the basic reproductive
number of infection was obtained from data for 63 Chinese cities [90]. Also, it has been shown that the
number of detected cases of COVID-19 in China is strongly positively correlated with the level of CO,
while in Italy and the USA such correlation exists with NO2 [91]. The mentioned study failed to
establish a clear correlation with the level of SO2. These pollutants can cause and intensify
inflammatory processes, as well as weaken the human immune system and make it more susceptible
to various pathogens [92]. High NO2 air pollution can suppress the production of endogenous nitric
oxide, which prevents the replication of the respiratory syncytial virus in the lungs. Also, it is important
to emphasize that the atmospheric concentration of NO2 strongly depends on the levels of local exhaust
emissions, so its correlation with virus transmission can be interpreted by the connection with the urban
environment, characterized by more intensive traffic [93].
Finally, we have also obtained some interesting correlations of the meteorological parameters with R0,
shown in Fig.s 6C and 6D. The most basic and yet potentially the most significant weather factor that
is widely investigated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is, of course, temperature. Humidity
also seems to have important effects on the spread of COVID-19, on par with the temperature. The
statistically very highly significant negative correlation of the basic reproductive number of SARSCoV-2 virus infection with both the mean temperature and humidity obtained in our research (Fig. 6D)
is consistent with the results of other relevant papers, e.g. [94]. For example, a similar correlation was
obtained in a study that analyzed COVID-19 outbreak in the cities of Chile - a country that covers
several climate zones, but where it is still safe to assume that social patterns of behavior and introduced
epidemic control measures do not drastically differ throughout the country [5]. Effectively the same
conclusion — that fewer COVID-19 cases were reported in countries with higher temperatures and
humidities — was reached in a study covering over 200 countries in the world [95].
While an established correlation between virus transmission and a certain factor is not, in general, a
telltale sign of a direct causal relationship between them, in the case of temperature and humidity such
connection is firmly indicated also by results of experimental research. For example, the spread of the
influenza virus, which occurs similarly to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [96], is boosted by low
temperature and low humidity, probably due to greater virion stability and easier spread of aerosols
under these conditions [97]. Similarly, another virus in the coronavirus family, SARS CoV, has been
shown to lose viability at high temperatures and humidity [98], and these findings are supported by
experiments on similar viruses, e.g. on transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis
virus (MHV) [99].
Therefore, the conclusion about negative correlations of air temperature and humidity with the virus
transmissibility stands out as a robust result in the literature, as it is supported by findings of numerous
theoretical analyses of COVID-19 pandemic data, and experimental results on viruses that share

This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article

18

COVID-19 Environmental Dependence
similarities in structure and/or pathogenesis with SARS-CoV-2. However, we still note that studies of
correlations of these factors with the basic reproductive number in several cases have yielded different
conclusions, most likely due to the method of calculating R0 or due to choosing a small/uninformative
sample of populations in which the number of infected cases was monitored [100-102]. For example,
a study focused on the suburbs of New York, Queens, obtained a positive correlation between virus
transmission and temperature, which seems unexpected given the prevailing observations of other
studies [103]. This result is most likely a consequence of analyzing data for a small area (Queens only)
where the temperature varies in a relatively narrow range of values, as well as correlating the number
of detected cases, which may be sensitive to variations in the testing procedure.
Another environmental agent that can destroy or inactivate viruses is UV radiation from sunlight, and
the properties of a particular virus determine how long it can remain infectious when exposed to
radiation. For example, epidemics of influenza have a seasonal character precisely due to the
susceptibility of influenza viruses to UV radiation [104]. Our analysis found, at very high statistical
significance, a strong negative correlation between the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the
intensity of UV radiation, which is consistent with the results of other studies obtained for the cities of
Brazil and the provinces of Iran [105, 106]. It is worth mentioning that lower temperatures, humidity,
and sunlight levels usually occur in combination and directly affect not only the virus but also the
human behavior, so the observed higher transmission of the virus in such conditions can alternatively
be interpreted by indirect effects of other factors that act together in cold weather, such as more time
spent indoors where the virus spreads more easily, or weakening of the immune system that increases
susceptibility to infections [107].
While the results related to COVID-19 correlations with temperature, humidity, and UV radiation are
fairly frequent in the literature, this is less so for the results on the precipitation levels. Very few other
studies have examined the association of precipitation with SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with either no
correlation found [52], or looking at precipitation as a surrogate for humidity and generally receiving
a negative correlation with infection rate [56, 108]. Our results, however, shown in Fig. 6D, confirm
natural expectations: the data reveals a strong negative correlation of the total precipitation with R0,
only slightly lower than in the case of T, H, and UV, at a very high level of statistical significance.
Such results also concur with some general conclusions about the behavior of similar viruses: a
negative correlation between the rate of respiratory syncytial virus infection and the amount of
precipitation expressed in millimeters was shown in a one-year study on over 1000 infected children
in India [109, 110].
Our analysis did not reveal any statistically significant correlation either between the wind speed or
between air pressure and SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. In the case of wind speed, this result agrees
with the findings in some other papers [111, 112]. A positive correlation of wind speed with COVID19 transmissibility was obtained in a study in Chilean cities, but, as the authors themselves note, the
interpretation of the effect of this factor is complicated by its observed significant interaction with
temperature [5]. The role of wind in transmitting the virus to neighboring buildings is predicted by the
SARS virus spread model within the Amoy Gardens residential complex in Hong Kong, but such an
effect may relate to local air currents and virus transmission over relatively short distances and does
not imply a correlation of mean wind speeds in the area with virus transmission [110, 113]. As for the
air pressure, the potential connection is hardly at all investigated in the literature. An exception is a
study [114] reporting a positive correlation of air pressure with the number of COVID-19 cases in parts
of Mozambique, but our results do not confirm such a conclusion (on the contrary, our results rather
speak in favor of negative correlation, though they lack statistical significance).

Conclusion

While there is by now a significant amount of research on a crucial problem of how environmental
factors affect COVID19 spread, several features set this analysis apart from the existing research. First
is the applied methodology: instead of basing analysis directly on the number of detected COVID-19
cases (or some of its simple derivatives), we employ an adapted SEIR model to extract the basic
reproduction number R0 from the initial stage of the epidemic. By taking into account only data in the
exponential growth regime, i.e. before the social measures took effect (as explained in the Methods
section), we ensured that the correlations we have later identified were not confounded with the effects
of local COVID-19 policies. Even more importantly, our method is also invariant to variations in
COVID-19 testing practices, which, as is well known, used to vary in quite an unpredictable manner
between different countries. Another important factor is the large geographical scope of our research:
we collected data from 118 countries worldwide, more precisely, from all the countries that were above
a certain threshold for the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (except for several countries with
clearly irregular early growth data). The third factor was the number of analyzed parameters: we
calculated correlations for the selected 42 different variables (of more than a hundred that we initially
considered overall) and looked for viable interpretations of the obtained results. It is the combination
of all three factors that we believe makes this study unique, comprehensive, and reliable.
These results should also help in resolving some of the existing disputes in literature. For example, our
findings indicate that correlation of HDI with R0 is not a consequence of the COVID-19 testing bias,
as was occasionally argued. Of the opposing opinions, our data seem to support assertions that blood
types are indeed related to COVID-19 transmissibility, as well as arguments that the higher prevalence
of smoking does increase the virus transmissibility (though weakly). On the other hand, in the dispute
about the effects of the pollution, our correlations give an edge to claims that there is no correlation
between PM2.5 and PM10 particles and transmissibility (whereas we agree with the prevailing
conclusions about the positive correlation of other considered pollutants). In the case of the effects of
the wind, based on the obtained results we tend to side with those denying any connection. In certain
cases our findings contradict popular narratives: there are no clear indications that either number of
refugees or physical inactivity intensifies the spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately, our data also
diminishes hopes that BCG immunization could help in subduing the epidemic. Additionally, the
obtained correlations hint to possible new alleys of research, e.g. those that would help us understand
the connection between cholesterol levels and SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility.
Overall, we strongly believe that the presented results can be a significant contribution to the ongoing
attempts to better understand the first pandemic of the 21st century - and the better we understand it,
the sooner we may hope to overcome it.
