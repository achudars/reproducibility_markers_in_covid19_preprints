Abstract
Due to the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic,
there is an urgent need for novel therapies and
drugs. We conducted a large-scale virtual screening for small molecules that are potential CoV-2
inhibitors. To this end, we utilized “ChemAI,” a
deep neural network trained on more than 220M
data points across 3.6M molecules from three
public drug-discovery databases. With ChemAI,
we screened and ranked one billion molecules
from the ZINC database for favourable effects
against CoV-2. We then reduced the result to the
30,000 top-ranked compounds, which are readily
accessible and purchasable via the ZINC database.
Additionally, we screened the DrugBank using
ChemAI to allow for drug repurposing, which
would be a fast way towards a therapy. We provide
these top-ranked compounds of ZINC and DrugBank as a library for further screening with bioassays at https://github.com/ml-jku/
sars-cov-inhibitors-chemai.

Introduction. Due to the current world-wide crisis of
SARS-CoV-2 virus infections, there is a strong need for
new therapies. While many efforts are focused on repurposing existing drugs (Zhou et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Ton
et al., 2020), we suggest to test new molecules with potentially higher efficacy. Therefore, we performed a large-scale
ligand-based virtual screening run, which resulted in 30,000
potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors with favorable properties.
The screening method is at the core a deep neural network
for drug discovery (Hochreiter et al., 2018; Klambauer et al.,
2019). We actively reach out to the scientific community to
test these molecules and consider them as a custom-designed

chemical library.
Most current virtual screens are structure-based and use
docking methods (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020;
Haider et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Fischer et al., 2020;
Chen et al., 2020; Ton et al., 2020; Senathilake et al., 2020;
Ruan et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020;
Gorgulla et al., 2020) while only one screen is ligand-based
and uses a similarity-based approach (Zhu et al., 2020). The
largest docking studies screen databases with sizes ranging
from roughly 700 million (Fischer et al., 2020) to 1.3 billion
(Ton et al., 2020) molecules. Also our study operates on
databases of this size, concretely we perform a ligand-based
virtual screening of a collection of one billion molecules
from the ZINC database.

Deep ligand-based virtual screening. “ChemAI” is a
deep neural network trained to simultaneously predict a
large number of biological effects (Mayr et al., 2018; Preuer
et al., 2019). In more detail, the network is of the type
SmilesLSTM (Mayr et al., 2018; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and trained on a data set comprised of ChEMBL
(Gaulton et al., 2017), ZINC (Sterling & Irwin, 2015) and
PubChem (Kim et al., 2016), and which is similar to the
data set used by Preuer et al. (2018). ChemAI predicts 6,269
biological outcomes, such as binding to targets, inhibitory
or toxic effects. The network was trained in a multi-task
setting, in which data from other bioassays was used to
enhance the predictive power for SARS-CoV inhibitory effects. Each modelled biological effect is represented by an
output neuron of the neural network. We utilized a small
set of output neurons associated with SARS-CoV inhibition
and a set of output neurons associated with toxic effects to
rank compounds.
We screen the ZINC database because it contains a large
set of diverse molecules and additionally provides links to
vendors from which to purchase and physically obtain those
molecules. We downloaded 898,196,375 molecules from
ZINC and converted them to canonical SMILES (Weininger,
1988) using RDKit (Landrum, 2006). We then performed
inference with ChemAI to obtain predictions for each of

those roughly one billion molecules.
Selecting bioassays for multiple targets of SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 has two main proteases that are critical
for its replication, namely the 3CLpro (3C-like protease)
and PLpro (Papain Like Protease), encoded in an open reading frame (Macchiagodena et al., 2020). A compound that
inhibits both proteases could be promising drug candidates
(Ledford, 2009; Collison, 2019). The virus proteases are
also strikingly similar to those in SARS-CoV-1 (Macchiagodena et al., 2020), which is also an implicit assumption by
docking-based approaches. We therefore select two groups
of assays, one of which measures the inhibition of 3CLpro
and the other the inhibition of PLpro (see Table 1). For
each of those four assays, ChemAI possesses an output unit,
which models the ability of small molecules to exhibit the
effect measured by the assay. Thus, using the predictions
yielded by ChemAI, it is possible to rank compounds by
their predicted ability to inhibit the two main proteases of
SARS-CoV-1, which can be a proxy for the inhibitory potential for SARS-CoV-2.
Consensus ranking. We developed a library of compounds which is enriched for molecules with the ability
to inhibit both proteases of the SARS-CoV-2. In order
to score the multi-target effect, we calculated a consensus
score for each molecule as the average rank of the predictions over the four selected assays (see Table 1). We then
ranked all compounds by this consensus score. For each of
the top-ranked compounds, we also calculated their minimal
distance to actives in the training set to be able to identify
novel chemical structures. Furthermore, for each compound
we also report its number of potential toxic effects (Mayr
et al., 2016).
For the distance metric, we used the Jaccard distance based
on binary ECFP4 fingerprints folded to a length of 1024,
which yields values in the interval [0, 1]. For potential toxic
effects, we used 75 output units of ChemAI with high predictive quality, concretely an area under ROC-curve (AUC)
larger than 0.80, and counted how many of those output
units indicated a toxic effect. This value is reported in Table 2 (column “tox”). Furthermore, we report the clinical
toxicity probability predicted by an independent multitask

neural network fitted on the ClinTox dataset (Wu et al.,
2018). These probability values are calibrated by Platt scaling (Platt et al., 1999) and reported in Table 2 (column “ct”).
The additional information contained in these values can be
used to obtain a refined ranking for testing the molecules.
We implemented the overall process as a two-step approach.
In the first step, we reduced the ZINC database of one billion
molecules to a smaller set, where we kept all molecules that
exhibited some predicted activity on any of the four assays
(precisely, at least one of the predictions had to reside in the
top-1% quantile). In this way, we obtained an intermediate
dataset of 5,672,501 molecules. For those molecules, the
consensus score, the toxicity flags and the distance to known
actives were calculated. In the second step, we reduced the
dataset to the top-ranked 30,000 molecules by the consensus
score.
Results. With the abovementioned approach, we assembled a library of potential inhibitors of SARS-Cov-2. We
report three metrics for each compound: a) predicted inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV proteases b) potential toxicities and c) distance to known actives. This led to a ranked
list of compounds of which we provide the top 30,000 as
a screening library. The top-ranked molecules are given in
Table 2 and Figure 1.
We also checked whether molecules suggested by other
publications can be confirmed by ChemAI. Overall, some
suggested molecules show at least mild predicted activity
against SARS-CoV (see Table 3).
Drug repurposing of DrugBank molecules. With the
same procedure employed for ZINC, we also screened the
DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2018), a database of ≈10,000
drugs. Again, we predicted inhibitory effects on the two
viral proteases using ChemAI, and then calculated a consensus score for each drug. In this way, we obtained a ranked
list of drugs that could be potential SARS-Cov inhibitors,
which could be fast ways to therapies via drug repurposing
(Ashburn & Thor, 2004). We provide this list freely for
research institutions (see Availability).
Discussion. In this work, we presented the construction
of a screening library of small molecules that are potential

Large-scale ligand-based virtual screening for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors using deep neural networks

inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. Our ligand-based approach uses
a neural network trained to predict the outcomes of bioassays. From this multi-task models, four tasks have been
selected to predict the inhibitory potential against SARSCoV-1. A consensus between these predictions was used
to rank compounds from the ZINC database, of which the
30,000 top-ranked are reported.
The approach is limited by the predictive quality of the
underlying machine learning method, evaluated via AUC
and leading to values in the range of 0.69 to 0.78. While
these results are very promising, improved data quality,
larger amount of data or machine-learning approaches could
lead to increased predictive performance and quality of
the library. A promising direction is also to enrich the
representation of molecules via already available biological
modalities (Simm et al., 2018; Hofmarcher et al., 2019).

We expect that the data for SARS-CoV-1 already has high
predictive power for inhibitory effects of compounds on
SARS-CoV-2. However, the current predictions can be
further adjusted toward SARS-CoV-2 via transfer-learning
and the incorporation of new data from SARS-CoV-2. In
particular, few shot learning may be utilized for the first
measurements for SARS-CoV-2 thus adjusting the multitask model toward SARS-CoV-2.
