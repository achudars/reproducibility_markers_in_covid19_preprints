Abstract
In a recent report we have collected some data about the COVID19 epidemics in Northern Italy; in this follow-up we analyze how these
changed after the mild restrictive measures taken by the Government two
weeks ago and the large campaign of public awareness developed in the
meanwhile.

In a recent report [1] we have collected some data about the COVID-19
epidemics in Northern Italy; in particular, we have analyzed and fitted them
by an exponential law in order to extract the growth factor both at nationwide
level and at the local one. The purpose of this follow-up is to analyze how these
changed after the mild restrictive measures taken by the Government and the
campaign of public awareness.
These started at February 24; the effect of such measures is of course showing
up with some delay, corresponding to the incubation time of COVID-19.
The outcome of our analysis is that there was a slowing down of the epidemics, but this is still too weak to face the menace of a large scale epidemics.
Actually, more stringent restrictions went on operation from March 8, and our
analysis shows that these were fully justified.
Our analysis is purely at the statistical level over available data; that is,
we will not discuss any model nor try to interpret the data in view of several
theories circulating in the scientific communities; in particular we do not try
to estimate the real number of infections, which according to certain analysis
could be from two to three times the number of known cases.
The data for countries other than Italy are extracted from the “situation
reports” of the World Health Organization [2]; those for Italy are extracted
1

from “Ministero della Salute” and “Protezione Civile” (a governmental agency)
[3, 4].
In all cases, we consider – as predicted by virtually all epidemiological models
for the initial phase of an epidemic [5, 6, 7] – an exponential law for the number
of infected people,
n(t) = exp[α t] n(0)
(1)
and tried to fit α the growth exponent α from available data. (We will always
use one day as the time unit.)
Two other relevant epidemiological parameters are simply related to α. The
doubling time τ is the time needed to double n(t), i.e. such that n(t+τ ) = 2n(t);
this is obtained from the above via
τ = α−1 log(2) .

(2)

The daily growth factor γ,such that n(t + 1) = γn(t), is determined as
γ = exp[α] .

Benchmarks: China, Korea

In [1] we have analyzed data from China and Korea in order to have a term of
comparison. Tables reporting the (updated to March 7) data for these countries
are reported in Appendix A. We are interested in fitting these data with an
exponential law, considering limited timespans; in particular we are interested
in considering how the restrictive measures adopted by the Chinese and Korean
Governments influenced the growth factor α.
In order to do this we considered in both cases an “initial” and a “final” (or
actually a “recent”) timespan; in order to make a more direct comparison, we
decided here – at difference with what was done in [1] – to consider in all cases
a period of one week.
In the case of China the initial period was that of January 23 to February
2, the final one that of February 27 to March 7; while for Republic of Korea
the initial period it was that of February 18 to February 24, and the final one
from March 1 to March 7. We denote by a subscript “i” and by a subscript “f ”
the quantities referring to the initial and final week respectively. We will also
consider the simplest measure of the reduction of the epidemic speed, i.e. the
ratio r = αf /αi .
The result of the analysis for China and Korea is summarized in Table I.a
below. See also Figure 1.

Other European countries: France,
Germany and Spain

In the last few days the COVID-19 epidemics reached other continental European countries; the data for some of these – in particular, France, Germany and
Spain – are also given in Appendix A. In this case there were no substantial
restrictive measures yet,nor any time to observe a change in the trend, so we are
only able to make a measurement of the growth exponent in the initial phase of
the epidemics and to compare it with the one observed in Italy. The parameters
for France, Germany and Spain are given in Table I.b below; see also Figure 2.

Italy: national and regional data

The data for Italy (I) and for the regions more heavily touched by the virus, i.e.
Lombardia (L), Veneto (V) and Emilia-Romagna (ER) are reported in Appendix
B. These time series are shorter than the ones available for China and Korea,
and for these day one is February 21; moreover the first three days show a
very steep increase of cases, which could be due to late recognition of infections
present since some time. Also, restrictive measures were taken on February 24
and in view of the incubation time of COVID-19 they could show their effect
only after about ten days. We decided therefore to consider as initial period the
days from February 24 to February 28 (inclusive), and as final period the days
from March 3 to March 7 (inclusive).
We measure the achieved reduction in the speed of the epidemic by the
parameter
αf
.

It is interesting to consider two other parameters, i.e. the ratio ρ of infected people in Home isolation – thus presumably with light or no symptoms

– to the total of infective people (note this includes only those for which the
infection is active), and the ratio σ of patients in Intensive Care units to the
total of hospitalized patients. The latter is possibly confused in the last days,
as “sub-intensive care” units were created. As for the former, this is possibly
influenced by the fact that in the presence of a large number of infected with
heavy symptoms there is little chance to analyze people with light symptoms or
who just had contacts with known infected but show no symptoms; this could
explain why ρ remained around 0.5 for several days to fall down as the number
of infections raised sharply. Data for the quantities ρ and σ are also given in
Appendix B.

Local communities in Northern Italy

In our previous study, we had considered a few Departments in Northern Italy,
mostly located near the area which was more heavily struck by COVID-19.
Data for these – i.e. Lodi (LO), Cremona (CR), Piacenza (PC), Pavia (PV),
Bergamo (BG), Brescia (BS), Milano (MI) and Padova (PD) – are given in
Appendix C; here we also provide data for other Departments which were not
considered in [1] but do now show some worrying evolution, i.e. Venezia (VE),
Treviso (TV), Rimini (RN) and Pesaro (PU).
The initial and final period considered for these Departments are the same
considered for the nationwide and regional analysis in Italy, i.e. February 24 to

5

February 28 (inclusive) and March 3 to March 7 (inclusive).
The results of the analysis are summarized in Table III; see also Figures 4
and 5. Note that while the exponential fits are usually quite good, in some cases
– where large fluctuations in the new data, possibly due to delay in registration
of new infections, seem to be present – they appear to be less reliable.

Discussion and conclusions

We have analyzed how the epidemiological data, in particular the exponential
growth rate α defined by (1) and the related quantities τ and γ, see (2) and
(3), changed from the initial phase of the epidemics in Northern Italy to the
last days. In particular, this allowed to give an evaluation of the effect of the
mild restrictive measures taken by the Italian Government and of the large-scale
public awareness campaign going on in the country.
The main parameter to evaluate this effect is the reduction factor r defined
in (4). In the case of the Republic of Korea, i.e. a country with a similar total
population and political system but different restrictive measures, this turned
out to be r = 0.20.
In the case of Italy, we estimated r = 0.88; the reduction factor is however
quite different in different regions and – as had to be expected on statistical basis – even more so when we look at a finer scale, i.e. for different Departments,
see Table III. It turns out from this table that in some Department (in particular, among those considered here, Milano and Rimini – note however that for
the latter the exponential fit is not very good) the epidemic speed has indeed
grown up in the last period. In other Departments the reduction has been from
moderate, around r = 0.7 to discrete, i.e. around r = 0.45, and in one case
(Treviso) quite good, with r = 0.26, and comparable with that of Korea despite
the restrictive measures taken here were much milder than in Korea.

In any case, the reduction achieved is encouraging, but clearly far from being
sufficient to stop or even substantially slow down the epidemic dynamics1 ; a
much more substantial reduction is required for this.
We have also considered the initial epidemic dynamics in other European
countries,in particular France, Germany and Spain; here the data analyzed concerned the whole of the countries. We noted that the exponential growth rate
in these countries range from 0.36 of Germany to 0.47 of Spain, with an intermediate 0.38 for France. These worrying figures should be compared with the
initial growth rate in Italy, i.e. 0.34 for the whole country with 0.29 for the most
affected region, i.e. Lombardia; they mean the possibility of a large COVID-19
epidemic in these countries in the next weeks should not be discarded unless
prompt action is taken there too.
