Abstract

So far most of the analysis of Coronavirus 2020 epidemic data has been focusing on a short-time
window and consequently a quantitative test of statistical physical laws of Coronavirus Epidemics
with Containment Measures (CEwCM) is currently lacking. Here we report a quantitative analysis
of CEwCM over 230 days, covering the full-time lapse of the first epidemic wave. We use a 3D
phase diagram tracking the simultaneous evolution of the doubling time Td(t) and reproductive
number Rt(t) showing that this expanded parameter space is needed for biological physics of
CEwCP. We have verified that in the supercritical [Rt(t)>1, Td(t)<40 days] regime i) the curve Z(t)
of total infected cases, follows the growth rate called Ostwald law; ii) the doubling time follows the
exponential law Td(t)=A e(t-t0)/s as a function of time and iii) the power law Td(t)=C (Rt(t)-1)-n is
verified with the exponent n depending on the definition of Rt(t). The log-log plots Td(t) versus (Rt1) of the second 2020 epidemic wave unveils in the subcritical regime [Td(t)>100 days] arrested
metastable phases with Rt>1 where Td(t) was kept constant followed by its explosion and its
containment following the same power law as in the first wave. These results provide new tools for
early prediction of epidemic evolution.
1. Introduction
While the mean-field theory of intrinsic dynamics of uncontrolled epidemics is well known1,2,
nowadays the scientific discussion is focusing on the dynamics of Epidemics with Containment
Measures2-5, addressing the role of extrinsic effects due to the spatio-temporal evolution of contact
networks6-9. In this work we verify proposed mathematical laws driving Coronavirus 2020
Epidemics with Containment Measures (called here CEwCM). Different epidemiology protocols
such as Lockdown, case Finding, mobile Tracing (LFT)10-16 and Lockdown Stop and Go (LSG)1719

has been applied by different countries.

While previous works20-30 have analyzed short-time intervals of the CEwCM, we analyze here the
full-time window i.e., 230 days of the first Covid-19 wave and the second 2020 wave in Italy. We
focus on data analysis of three representative countries: i) South Korea, which applied the LFT
policy compared with ii) Italy and iii) United States of America which applied the LSG policy with
strict and loose rules respectively. We have tested key physical laws of the time evolution24-30 of the
1

CEwCM using a new 3D expanded parameter space, Td(t, Rt): where Td(t) and Rt(t) are the timedependent doubling and reproductive number.
In CEwCM time evolution three main regimes are clearly identified: supercritical, critical, and
subcritical phase. In the supercritical phase the extrinsic effects control the characteristic time s in
the exponential law of the time-dependent doubling time Td(t)=Ae(t-t0)/s. We have verified here that
in the first wave this phase is characterized by the Td(t)=C(Rt(t)-1)-ŒΩ power law function of the
variable doubling time Td(t) versus the reproductive number Rt(t).
A key result of this work is the use of the log-log plots of Td(t) versus (Rt(t)-1) to understand the
time evolution of coronavirus first wave which is used to characterize the time evolution of
epidemics in different countries. The results provide a quantitative comparison of the Covid-19 first
wave evolution resulting from different choices of containment policies and the evolution of the
second wave in Italy compared with South Korea.
2. Results and Discussion
The data for each country have been taken from the recognized public data base OurWorldInData31.
We have extracted, first, the time-dependent doubling time Td(t) from the curve of total infected
cases, Z(t), and, second, the time-dependent reproductive number Rt(t) from the curve of active
infected cases, X(t), using the methodological definition provided by the Koch Institute31. The
qualitative results of this approach have been verified by producing the log-log plots of Td(t) versus
(Re(t)-1) where the effective reproductive number Re(t) and Td(t) have been extracted from joint Z(t)
and X(t) curves by using the inverted SIR model.
2.1 The basic doubling time Td0 and basic reproductive number R0.
Fig. 1a shows a pictorial view of the viral epidemic spreading starting with the uncontrolled
epidemic in the early days of the outbreak with a basic reproductive number R0=2 and the basic
doubling time Td0=2 days (which separates successive nth generations with 2n infected persons).
In the early days the cumulative curve of the total number of cases ùëç ùë° increases exponentially

2.2 Time evolution law of the time-dependent doubling time Td(t) and reproduction number Rt(t) in
the 3D phase diagram Td(t,Rt)
As the epidemic goes forward, the total number of cases ùëç ùë° will include both the active cases and
the removed (recovered) individuals. The time evolution of the epidemics modified by extrinsic
effects of the containment measures is tracked by the time-dependent doubling time, Td(t). The timedependent Td(t) of Coronavirus 2020 epidemics is obtained by fitting the cumulative curve ùëç ùë°
over a five days period centered at t¬±Dt with Dt=2 days. Td(t) has been evaluated by taking the time
derivative of the cumulative curve ùëç ùë° over five days of the logarithm of the cumulative infection

The time-dependent variable reproductive number Rt can be measured by different methods2-7,32-34.
We have first used the model independent procedure proposed by the Koch Institute33, where Rt is
the ratio of the actually infected individuals X(t) at time t divided by the actually infected individuals
at the time (t ‚Äì Œît):

ùê∂K = ‚àÜùë° ùëôùëúùëî 2 and the exponent ùúà = 1 under the hypothesis that ‚àÜùë° is small.
We have used in this work ‚àÜùë° = 5 days, which gives a values of Rt in qualitative agreement with
other methods.34 Fitting the data where the empirical Rt value calculated by the Koch method using
the time interval, Œît=5 days, we have found the exponent ùúà ‚âà 0.7 ¬± 0.05 in the three studied

Fig. 1b shows the expanded three-dimensional parameter space Td(t‚Äô,Rt) proposed in this work. The
joint plot of the calculated Td(t), Td(Rt) and Rt(t) functions provides an exhaustive description of the
epidemic spreading during the time interval t'=t-t0=230 days, where t0 is the day onset of the first
wave of Covid-19 outbreak in the three studied countries. The gray slab indicates the critical regime
where 40<Td(t)<100 days and Rt(t*) ~ 1. Around the time t* the curve of the active infected cases
X(t) of the Covid-19 epidemic wave reaches the maximum of a dome.
The gray critical zone separates the supercritical regime from the subcritical regime.
The supercritical regimes occurs in the lower part of Fig. 1b characterized by a shorter doubling
time Td(t)<Td(t*)=40 days, for t'<t* and a larger reproductive number Rt(t)>1 which occurs where
the curve of the active infected cases X(t) is growing.
The subcritical regime occurs in the upper part of Fig. 1b where Td(t)> 100 days and Rt(t)<1, i.e.,
where the curve X(t) is decreasing. Fig. 1c shows the projection of the 3D plot in the Td-Rt plane
for the three considered countries. This figure allows us to verify that in the supercritical regime
(orange area) Td(Rt) follows the universal power law of Eq. 8 characterized by the divergence of
Td(Rt) while approaching Rt=1 (thick dotted line). In the subcritical phase we see a random
distribution of the data pairs (Td, Rt) indicating the incoherent arrested phase in the green area. Fig.
1d shows both Td(t) and Rt(t) vs. the time t'=t-t0 for each country. The critical phase is indicated by
the full grey slab as in the 3D plot of Fig. 1b, which corresponds to the range [40-100] days of the
doubling time Td(t) and the reproductive number in the range 1<Rt(t)<1.1.
The supercritical regime is indicated by the yellow areas, ranging from the outbreak threshold time
t0 and the day t*, where Td(t*) reaches the value of 40 days. The straight line Td(t) in the semilogarithm scale in the yellow region shows that in the supercritical regime, the doubling time Td(t)
follows the universal exponential law10,27
Td(t)=Ae(t-t )/s

(8)

0

where t0 is the time of the onset of the outbreak and s (called the s-factor) is the characteristic time
of the applied containment policy10,27. The upper panel shows that the time lapse of the supercritical
phase t*-t0 =24 days for the yellow region of South Korea is related with the small s-factor (6-7
days) which are both a factor 2.5 shorter than the s-factor of Italy and USA where 60<(t*-t0)<70
days, which imply a time duration of the first wave lockdown a factor 2-3 longer.
The arrested phase occurs in the light blue areas where Td(t) becomes larger than 100 and Rt(t) drops
below 1 (see green areas in Figure 1d).
Italy reached a well defined arrested phase extending in the green area due to the enforced strict
rules of the imposed lockdown. On the contrary, the plot shows that in USA, where loose rules for
the lockdown have been applied, the transition to the subcritical regime has been stopped, and the
4

country remained for a very long time in the critical phase. This approach shows that the arrested
phase in South Korea remained close to the critical phase and faced a second Covid-19 very short
wave indicated by the yellow area. We underline that the second wave in South Korea lasted only
20 days and with a doubling time longer than 40 days. The shape of the second wave in South Korea
clearly shows the efficiency of the applied contact tracing to keep the spreading under control, to
reduce the lockdown to a minimum time and to reduce the number of fatalities.
2.3 Infection and removal time from inverted SIR model: the Re(t) time-dependent reproduction time
in the Td(t, Re) phase diagram
We move now to describe the Td(t‚Äô,Re) phase diagram, where the effective reproduction time,
namely Re(t), is extracted by the inverted SIR theory25,26.
In the framework of the SIR mean-field theory, the individuals in a population are classified as
Susceptible (if they haven‚Äôt yet developed the infection), Infected (if they currently carry the
infection) and Removed (if they have recovered from the infection or dead or they have been
vaccinated or confined by strict rules, see for instance the case of the Covid-hotels organized in
some countries or regions). The rate of change of these populations is calculated by introducing two
characteristic times: the infection time (ùúèT , the mean time between two infections made by an
infected individual) and the removal time (ùúèU , the mean time needed for an individual that has been
infected to recover from the disease or to die).
While in the classical epidemiology, for an uncontrolled epidemic spreading the infection time and
the removal time have constant values characteristic of the outbreak, in a controlled epidemic
spreading after the introduction of containment measures both the infection and removal times are
time-dependent. If we indicate with N the size of the population, then the system of ordinary
differential equations governing S, X and Y the number of Susceptible, Infected, and Removed
individuals, respectively can be written as:

pointing out that the rate of changes of the Infected is related to the ratio of ùúèU to ùúèT that is called
here the effective reproduction number ùëÖ\ ùë° .
The values of ùëÖ\ ùë° for the three countries calculated with Eq. 11 are shown in Fig. 2.
The amount of currently infected or active positive cases (I) and the total number Z = X + Y of
individuals that are affected, at any time, by the infection are available on the data base. The rate

Using Eq. 13 we have extracted the infection time, œÑi, and removal time, œÑr, shown in Figure 2 in
three selected countries. Moreover, we have calculated the amount of the actually infected, the
removed and the total cases by using the extracted œÑi and œÑr values and compared the results with the
epidemic data. The curves quantitatively agree thus validating the consistency of the procedure.
Figure 2a shows that the transition from the supercritical to the subcritical regime is driven by the
joint increase of œÑi and decrease of œÑr. The opposite occurs when the subcritical to the supercritical
transition happens in metastable phases at end of the first wave and the threshold of the second
wave.
In Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c a similar analysis is performed on the epidemic data of Italy and USA
respectively. The comparison among countries shown in Figure 2a, 2b and 1c indicates different
efforts in testing and tracing.
The cumulative curve Z(t) of the total number of cases of the epidemics in the supercritical phase,
slows down approaching the critical regime, where it has been fitted by the complex Ostwald growth

which is a mixed exponential and power-law behavior determined by nucleation of different phases
and ordering phenomena in complex multiphase systems out of equilibrium35-37. The onset of this
behavior, obtained by best curve fitting, is reported by the dashed lines in the central panels of Fig.

The doubling time Td(t) calculated using Eq.17, has been plotted in Figure 2 with the effective
reproduction number Re(t), computed within the SIR model. The Td(t) curve estimated with the SIR
model agrees with the Td(t) curve estimated from the epidemic data (shown in the upper panel of
Figure 2d).
At variance the Re(t) curve exhibits only a qualitative agreement with the corresponding Rt(t) curve
estimated with the Koch Institute method shown in Fig.1. Nevertheless, both methods agree on the
time where the critical regime occurs, i.e., when both Rt(t) and Re(t) are equal to one.
2.4 The universal power law relation between time-dependent doubling time, Td(t), and
reproduction number, Rt(t), in the supercritical phase: prediction of the onset of new epidemic
waves.
Log-log plot of the doubling time Td as a function of Rt-1 and Re-1 in the three countries are
compared in the upper and lower panels of Fig. 3. The Rt values are higher than Re calculated with
inverted SIR method. although the difference, the Td(t) vs Rt(t)-1 behavior in the two approach
appears qualitatively similar. We get the critical exponent ŒΩ=1, using Re-1 extracted by the meanfield inverted SIR model which is different from the exponent ŒΩ=0.7 obtained using Rt defined by
the Koch method.
The exponent ŒΩ=1 was predicted for the Koch Rt definition in the limit Œîùë° ‚Üí 0 by Eq.7 but this limit
cannot be reached since the time interval cannot be smaller than 3 days. We have estimated Rt with
the Koch Institute method33 using different time intervals Œît =3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 21 days. Afterwards
we have fitted the data Td(Rt) using Eq. 7 in the three selected countries using Rt measured with the
different time intervals Dt. We have found that the exponent ŒΩ decreases by increasing the time
k

interval Dt following the stretched exponential function ùúà = ùëí =(j(/W) with t=24.7 days and
b=0.76. Therefore, as predicted by Eq.7, we have found ùúà ‚Üí 1 for Œîùë° ‚Üí 0 that is in agreement with
the mathematical limit for the exponent extracted by the Koch method for the time interval Œîùë° ‚Üí 0.

This result is particularly relevant to predict the onset of new epidemic waves. The onset of the
supercritical phase of successive wave will be easily detected in the [Td, Rt-1] or [Td, Re-1] diagram
when dots move towards the yellow area, where the supercritical regime will be following the
universal power law of Eq. (7).
Fig.3 shows that in USA the epidemics never entered in the arrested phase and the it has been
fluctuating in the critical phase with an increasing (black dots) and decreasing (red dots) doubling
time along with the predictions of the power law.
The rapidly aborted second wave in South Korea is well depicted by the green dots forming the loop
in Fig.3, where the containment policy succeeded to push up the doubling-time avoiding its
following down toward the universal power law growth rate of the first Covid-19 wave.
2.5 Metastable phases and the second wave in Italy
In Figure 3 the phase diagram of epidemic spreading in Italy during the first wave shows the grey
strip corresponding to the critical regime occurring for Td(t) between 40 and 100 days above the
supercritical orange area, and the arrested subcritical regime, characterized by for Td(t)>100 days.
In this arrested subcritical phase the Td(t) vs Rt(t) values show a non-analytical disordered
distribution (see also Figure 1c), while in the supercritical regime it is described by the analytical
universal power law of Eq. (7). The green dots in the Td vs. Rt plots in Fig. 3 show that the arrested
phase occurs also for cases where Td(t)>100 although Rt(t)>1. When put on a lattice, the SIR model
depends on the geometry of contacts, and is in the same universality class as ordinary percolation.
Rt is essentially the percolation threshold for the SIR mean-field model, in fact infection can grow
without bound where Rt is greater than 1 on a Erdos-Reny network or a Bethe lattice38, while there
is no percolation for Rt less than 1. However, making the network composed of closed loops which
attenuate the probability of an epidemic, in different complex geometries and in presence of long
range interactions the percolating epidemic threshold could be larger than 1 (in fact it can be as high
as 1.2).39
The plot of the Italian case unveils the unexpected metastable phases in the arrested regime with
1.06<Rt(t)<1.2 with a decreasing reproduction number at constant doubling-time (Rt(t) decreases
while Td(t) remains constant) as indicated by horizontal arrows in the curve (green dots) of the (Td
vs Rt) plots.
After the flat metastable state in the subcritical phase at the end of the first wave on October 7, 2020
the doubling time decreased toward the supercritical regime at the end of the zig-zag behavior where
the arrows indicate the time direction. In Fig. 3 the data of South Korea at the end of the flat regime
show that the efficient mobile contact tracing elevated the doubling time. On the contrary in Italy
8

the poor contact tracing method enforced in Italy caused the decrease of the doubling time with the
onset of supercritical regime of the second Covid-19 epidemic wave.
The evolution of the second epidemic wave in Italy between Sept 1st and Dec 13th, is plotted in
Fig. 4. The data in panel b) of Fig. 3 and the data in Fig 4 overlap in the time period Sept 1st (245
DOY) and Oct 7 (281 DOY) where we have observed the metastable arrested phase discussed above
which can be considered either as the end of the first wave as well as the onset of the second wave.
Panel a) of Fig. 4 shows the lapse of time where the curve of active cases has shown its maximum
increasing rate due to the second wave in Italy. In the three panels if it is possible to see that from
DOY 275 (Oct 1st) to DOY=300 (Oct 26) the reproductive number increased from 1.05 to 1.4 while
the doubling-time decreased from Td=102 days in the subcritical regime to Td=19 days in the
supercritical regime. The rate of the growth rate of active cases started to decrease only after
DOY=300 (Oct 26). It is remarkable that in the time period 300<DOY< 330 days, when some strict
containment rules have been enforced, the CEwCM developed again as in the same regime of the
first wave following both Eq. 7 ùëá0 ùë° = ùê∂K ùëÖ( ùë° ‚àí 1

=L

and Eq. 8 Td(t)=Ae(t-t )/s where the s factor
0

is about two times larger than in the South Korea second wave shown in Fig. 3.
Conclusions
The results of this work provide an original quantitative approach for understanding the time
evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic. We show that it is necessary to expand the parameter space,
monitoring the evolution of the pair of relevant variables (Td, Rt). By expanding the parameter space
it became possible to analyze in a more precise and complete manner the data of the epidemics,
probing and tuning at the same time containment measures. This work sheds light and provides new
quantitative experimental tools for the quantitative statistical physics of this Covid-19 pandemic,
but certainly also to face future epidemic events thanks to its predicting power.
The results of our work can be summarized as follows: the joint analysis of the doubling time Td(t),
i.e., the time it takes for the number of infected individuals to double in value extracted from the
cumulative curves of total (infected plus removed) cases, combined with the reproductive number
Rt(t), i.e., the average number of infected persons by a single positive case, extracted from the
cumulative curves of the number of active infected cases, provide complementary information on
the efficiency of the applied containment policies. Therefore, the proposed approach could be used
to dynamically control and to improve the effects of mitigation policies.
The quantitative data analysis here presented has been able to test the correlated function of Td(t)
vs. Rt(t). The main result of this work is that the time evolution of CEwCM spreading in the
supercritical regime is characterized by the substantial growth of the doubling time Td(t) for Rt(t)>1
9

and Td(t)<40 days described by the power law curve Td = C(Rt-1)-ŒΩ. The second key result is the
identification that the Td(t) values for which the Covid-19 epidemic reaches the critical regime or
the plateau at the transition between the subcritical and the supercritical phase fall in the interval
40-100 days and ùëÖùë° ‚âà 1. Finally, we have clearly identified the metastable arrested phase of the
diffusion phenomenon with Rt (1.02<Rt<1.16) combined with a doubling time larger than 40 days
which are precursors of the onset of a second wave, result that can be adopted as an early warning
of new waves.

Figures and Figure captions

Figure 1 (a) Pictorial view of the epidemic growth starting with basic reproductive number, R0, and
basic doubling time, Td0. Containment measures in the supercritical phase of epidemic spreading
reduce the reproductive number 1<Rt<1 and lengthen the doubling time in the range 2<Td<40 days.
(b) The 3D phase diagram where the doubling time Td(t‚Äô,Rt) is plotted as a function of t'=t-t0 and
the effective reproductive number Rt for South Korea (green), Italy (red), and USA (black). The
gray space indicates the critical crossover where 40<Td<100 days separates the supercritical phase
(Td<40 days; Rt>1) from the arrested subcritical phase (Td>100 days; Rt<1). (c) Log-log plot of
doubling time Td vs Rt in the three countries. In the orange supercritical regime all curves of the
three countries are fitted by the function Td(t)=C(Rt(t)-1) -ŒΩ. The data in the subcritical regime, green
area, where Td>100 days and Rt<1, show the incoherent disordered behavior. The critical phase is
confined within the horizontal grey dashed strip where 40<Td<100 days. (d) Td and Rt as a function
of t'=t-t0 in the three selected countries. In the supercritical regime in the yellow areas the doubling
time (black curve) increases in the range 2<Td<40 days and the reproductive number Rt decreases
down to 1. In the arrested phases, indicated by the light blue areas, Td increases to a maximum and
Rt decreases up to a minimum and it extends up to the point where they cross again in the critical
regime. The green area identifies the subcritical regime for Rt<1 and Td>100 days where the
epidemic spreading is arrested. Finally, the grey area identifies the critical regime where 1<Rt <1.1
and 40<Td<100 days.

Figure 2 The inverted SIR model applied to (a) South Korea, (b) Italy, and (c) USA. The upper
panels show the extracted (red) removal time and (blue) infection time as a function of t-t0. In the
middle panels, we report the curves of cases per million population, of infected (X) (red), removed
Y (blue) and total cases (Z=X+Y) (black) as a function of time. The Z(t) curve follows the Ostwald
law10,27 (dashed line) characteristic of ordering growth in heterogeneous systems35-37. In the lower
panels we show Td and Rt (Re) as extracted by the inverted SIR model in analogy with Figure 2c.
The shaded light blue area indicates the arrested regime in the subcritical phase separating the first
and the second Covid-19 wave. In Italy this arrested phase occurs for 60<t'<230 days. In USA there
is no evidence for the presence of a subcritical regime, the yellow supercritical phase is followed by
the critical phase in the gray strip extending over a large time interval.

Figure 3 Log-log plot of doubling time Td in three countries as a function of R(t)-1 extracted by the
inverted SIR model (upper panels) and by the Koch Institute empirical method (lower panels). Black
dots in the yellow region indicate Td in the supercritical regime which follows the universal
analytical power law function [Td=C(Rt-1)-ŒΩ] of a divergent Td approaching Rt=1 fitted by the red
dashed lines. The critical exponent ŒΩ is 1 in the inverted SIR model and 0.7 using Koch prescriptions
with 5 days interval. The critical phase is described by the horizontal grey strip where 40<Td<100
days. The green dots in the blue light area indicate the metastable states in the subcritical regime
where the epidemic spreading growth is arrested Td>40 days also if Rt>1. While the metastable state
in Italy in the subcritical (green dots) with Td=constant indicates a precursor of the second wave
regime in South Korea, the loop of the curve (green dots) in the critical regime (gray strip) is
determined by the second wave shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2a. In USA the epidemic spreading
never entered in the arrested phase and reversible oscillations (Rt decreasing is inducted by red dots)
and are observed in the critical regime.

Figure 4) Panel a) the curve of the active infected cases and fatalities per million population as a
function of time during the second wave in Italy. The time is measured by the day of the year 2020
in the lower scale, and the time t'=t-t0 from the onset of the outbreak in Italy in the upper x scale.
Panel b) shows Td(t) and Rt(t) for the second wave in Italy with the same scale as in Fig. 1 for the
first wave in Italy. The yellow area indicates the explosive percolating epidemic regime of the
second wave in Italy. Panel c) shows the Td versus Rt plot of the second wave (red dots) compared
with the first wave (black dots). Panel d) shows the log-log plot of Td versus (Rt-1). The red dots in
the second wave shows the first uncontrolled increase of Rt and decrease of Td up to its peak in the
time lapse 274<DOY<300 which is followed by the coronavirus epidemics controlled by
containment measures in the time range 300<DOY<330 which follows the power law given by Eq.
