Abstract
We find UK “local lockdowns” of cities and small regions, focused on limiting how
many people a household can interact with and in what settings, are effective in
turning the tide on rising positive COVID-19 cases. Yet, by focusing on household
mixing within the home, these local lockdowns have not inflicted the large declines
in consumption observed in March 2020 when the first virus wave and first national
lockdown occurred. Our study harnesses a new source of real-time, transaction-level
consumption data that we show to be highly correlated with official statistics. The
effectiveness of local lockdowns are evaluated applying a difference-in-difference
approach which exploits nearby localities not subject to local lockdowns as comparison
groups. Our findings indicate that policymakers may be able to contain virus
outbreaks without killing local economies. However, the ultimate effectiveness of
local lockdowns is expected to be highly dependent on co-ordination between regions
and an effective system of testing.

Introduction

How can COVID-19 cases be contained without causing damage to the economy? This
question dominates the thinking of policymakers, who face a seemingly uncomfortable
trade-off between limiting virus transmission in the economy via reducing social contact,
and maintaining economic activity which relies on social contact for the production and
consumption of goods and services.
The first wave of COVID-19 in early 2020 saw most nations adopt stringent restrictions
on social contact in almost all settings in order to contain the spread of the virus.
These restrictions severely hindered the means of production and consumption in the
economy, leading to large drops in output from a combination of the virus and such
restrictions. However, recent improvements in testing and tracing leading to identification
of clusters of cases in high-infection areas have facilitated a more targeted, localised
approach to applying restrictions to social contact, known as “local lockdowns”. This
approach to limiting the spread of COVID-19 was identified early-on in the pandemic
as a beneficial strategy.1 In some countries – such as in the UK – governments have
legal powers to implement such local measures, but this has been a source of political
tension between local and national authorities.2 The centralized UK approach offers a
particularly interesting contrast to the US, where the policy response has limited national
co-ordination – and none in regards to lockdowns.
In this paper, we are the first academics to use a new source of real-time and highly
granular European consumption data. We combine these with data on coronavirus cases
to analyse the impact of local lockdowns on both COVID-19 cases and local consumption.
Using a difference-in-difference methodology, we estimate the impact of local lockdowns
imposed in the late summer of 2020 on a series of UK cities, examining their ability to

The legal power of the government in the UK to impose local restrictions contrasts with other nations,
such as the US and Spain, where such measures can only be implemented by local governments.
Nonetheless, both approaches have resulted in local resistance to such measures due to concerns of
the adverse effects on local economies – with a standoff between local and national governments over
locking down Madrid, anti-lockdown protests in London, Van Morrison releasing protest songs over the
Northern Ireland local lockdown and some mayors and local governments demanding responsibilities

contain of COVID-19 cases and how consumer spending responded.
Our study makes two main contributions.

First, we introduce a new source of

real-time, transaction-level consumption data – Fable Data – that can be used for economic
research and to inform policymaking. These data contain transaction-by-transaction
spending data, updated daily, for large representative samples of UK bank accounts and
credit cards, with individual-level identifiers and geocode identifiers. We show these data
are a highly correlated, leading indicator of official Bank of England statistics – data that
are only available in aggregated form and with many months lag – in contrast to Fable
Data which are available in real-time and disaggregated (correlation coefficient of 0.91
January 2018 - June 2020). These data are applicable to a broad variety of questions
in the analysis of individual consumption behavior. They present a new opportunity
for researchers to measure consumption in complementary and arguably more reliable
ways than using data from consumption surveys, which has become less reliable in recent
decades and has prompted a variety of initiatives aimed at improving the measurement of
consumption (see Browning et al., 2014; Landais and Spinnewijn, 2020). These data show
the UK’s economic recovery in spending April to August 2020 had stalled in September
and October.
Second, we advance understanding of the economic costs of mitigation strategies to
contain the second wave of COVID-19. This user-case is economically important and
policy-relevant to the time of writing, as policymakers around the world are grappling with
how to both contain second or third waves of virus outbreaks and also to keep economic
recoveries going. Local lockdowns are also a source of tensions between national and
local governments and thus our research may help to inform such disputes. The UK local
lockdowns we study apply to cities or small regions. They restrict how many individuals
people can mix with, in what settings (e.g. restaurants) and under what requirements
(e.g. outside, wearing masks). A key policy design was trying to enable people to keep
consuming in COVID-19 secure settings while limiting their interactions in less secure
settings (e.g. households visiting each others’ homes). We show that UK local lockdowns
to contain virus outbreaks – covering one in four people by September 2020 – typically

3

turn the tide on rising COVID-19 cases though there is heterogeneity in such results.3
We do not find evidence such local lockdowns resulted in large spending declines:
observing little, if any, declines. We use a difference-in-difference design that compares
the evolution of daily consumption in an area subject to a local lockdown compared to
a similar, nearby locality not subject to such restrictions. By using daily data we can
precisely estimate our results relative to the timing of local lockdowns being announced.
Our difference-in-difference approach is designed to be interpreted as descriptive not
causal.4 These data show – both for treatment and control localities – large drops in
consumption when the March 2020 first virus wave and national lockdown occurred. We
conclude there are little, if any, declines in spending from the local lockdowns: certainly
not of the magnitude of the March decline. Estimates for the time-path of cases, in
contrast, show that while COVID-19 cases typically continue to rise following the onset
of a local lockdown (as measures take time to have effect) they then start to stabilize:
indicating the local lockdowns had some short-term success.
While our evidence indicates some initial successes from local lockdowns, in late
September and October 2020 the UK (along with many European countries) experienced
a rapid, nationwide rise in COVID-19 cases (the cause of which is not yet clear). This
has led to more restrictive regional measures being introduced in mid-October including
shutting down businesses and before second and third national lockdowns were imposed
in November 2020 and January 2021. The COVID-19 positive case rates accompanying
these more recent lockdowns were far higher than the rates in the local lockdowns we
examine in this paper.
Our study contributes to a burgeoning literature understanding the economic effects
of COVID-19. A variety of early studies showed how the onset of COVID-19 dramatically
changed consumption behavior. The first study to do so was Baker et al. (2020) using US
3

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-52934822
We typically observe common pre-trends between control and treatment groups, however, we do observe
noticeable increases in the number of positive COVID-19 cases for the treatment groups just before and
after local lockdowns. The nature of local lockdowns explain this behavior – a key component is to
increase testing capacity and thus the number of positive cases will be expected to rise. However, some
areas subject to local lockdowns had rises that appear too large and sharp to be driven by differential
testing and in such cases the control localities are less suitable counterfactuals.

fintech data and following this Opportunity Insights (Chetty et al., 2020a,b) produced
a dashboard using multiple data sources to track regional US consumption behavior
alongside other economic indicators.5 Beyond the US similar exercises have been carried
out to understand household consumption in the early stages of the pandemic – showing
remarkably consistent results (Andersen et al., 2020; Bounie et al., 2020; Bourquin et al.,
2020; Campos-Vazquez and Esquivel, 2020; Carvalho et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020;
Chronopoulos et al., 2020; Horvath et al., 2020; Surico et al., 2020; Watanabe et al., 2020).
Analysis of JP Morgan Chase data (Cox et al., 2020; Farrell et al., 2020) has described in
detail how household balance sheets have changed as a result of the COVID-19 recession
and how households have responded to fiscal stimulus. A variety of studies have examined
the effects of the first set of lockdowns on economic behavior and evaluating the degree to
which there are trade-offs between policy interventions attempting to contain the virus
and economic damage (Aum et al., 2020; Beach et al., 2020; Barro et al., 2020; Coibion
et al., 2020; Correia et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2020; Dave et al., 2020; Friedson et al., 2020;

Data
Consumption Data

We combine data on cases of COVID-19 identified by the UK’s testing framework with
consumption data provided by Fable Data Limited.6 Fable data record hundreds of
millions of transactions on consumer and SME spending across Europe from 2016 onwards.7
Fable’s transaction data are anonymized and available in real-time: our research access
is with a one working day lag. Fable sources data from a variety of banks and credit

Commercial sensitivities mean we do not disclose the exact number of accounts and transactions
available in the data.

card companies: accounts cover both spending on credit cards and inflows and outflows
on current (checking) accounts. Data is at the account-level and hence we can follow
spending behavior on an individual account over time.8 Fable data is similar to recentlyavailable data sets from financial aggregators and service providers, but does not have
some of the limitations of other datasets and uses anonymised customer data.9
For each spending transaction we observe a standard classification merchant category
code for the spending type. Fable also produces its own categorizations of spending,
utilizing the more granular information it has available from transaction strings. These
data also differentiate between online and store-based transactions.
For each UK account we observe the postcode sector of the cardholder’s address. In
the UK, postcode sectors are very granular geographies: There are over 11,000 postcode
sectors in the UK with each sector containing approximately 3,000 addresses. Where a
transaction can be linked to a particular store, the full address of that store is available.
Where a transaction is of a listed firm, Fable tags merchants to their parent groups and
stock market tickers.
For this study we focus on transactions denominated in British pounds sterling on
UK-based credit card accounts held by consumers.10 The median and mean transaction
values are £15 and £39 respectively.
Transaction-level spending data is highly volatile – even with such large volumes of
transactions – and we observe strong movements at high frequency due to seasonality and
day of week effects. We therefore follow an approach to smooth the transaction volumes
over time as used by Opportunity Insights on similar US data (Chetty et al., 2020b,a):
aggregating spending by day at the level of geography of interest, taking a seven day
moving average and dividing by the previous year’s value.11 Finally, we normalize the

In cases where one individual has multiple accounts, we cannot link multiple accounts in the data to
the individual but can aggregate to a geographic region.

Baker (2018) provides validation and application of US financial aggregator data. Financial aggregator
data for the UK is widely shared for research purposes by MoneyDashBoard, UK-based a fintech
(Chronopoulos et al., 2020; Bourquin et al., 2020; Surico et al., 2020). Bourquin et al. (2020) analyse
the characteristics of MoneyDashBoard users.

We drop 113 individual credit card transactions over £50k as such outliers are unlikely to be consumer
transactions and may distort results for very small geographic regions.

series setting an index to 1 using the mean value 8 - 28 January 2020. We also construct
daily series using a 14 and 28 day moving averages in a analogous fashion.

2.2

Comparison with Official Statistics

Fable data have many useful features, such as timeliness (it is available the next working
day whereas official statistics are typically available only with a lag of several months),
geographic granularity (being available at a lower level than official statistics) and, transactionlevel (enabling more flexible analysis than aggregated official statistics). These data can
therefore potentially be used to construct leading indicators for policymakers and enable
researchers to answer a broader set of research questions than was previously possible
using prior data sources.
However, while these features are potentially valuable, their usefulness depends in part
on how this data series relates to comprehensive, official data. To explore this, Figure
A1, Panel A compares the time series of Fable Data UK annual changes in monthly
credit card spending to the Bank of England series and shows they are highly correlated:
correlations 0.91 (January 2018 to July 2020), 0.90 (January 2019 to July 2020) and 0.98
(January 2020 to July 2020). Bank of England data is only published in aggregated form
monthly and with a lag (e.g. July’s data was published at the start of September).
Figure A1, Panel B shows Fable data measures for 7, 14, 28 day moving averages
– which can be calculated daily in real-time – compared to the monthly series (which
requires waiting until month end). These daily moving averages show the sharp drop in
consumption in March 2020 far earlier than the monthly series. We thus conclude that
we can use these data as a reliable real-time predictor of official data and as a reasonable
proxy for measuring credit card spending.
On aggregate we observe the sharp fall in UK credit card spending near the time
of the spike in Covid-19 cases and national lockdown announcement on 23 March 2020
and then a fairly steady recovery May - August. Components of the national lockdown
were ended in June and July but we do not observe rapid boost after these was lifted
– indicating spending may have been suppressed by fear of the virus during this early
7

phase of the pandemic. In September and October 2020, we observe these data to show
that the recovery in spending since April 2020 has stalled and has started to decline.
In a companion paper (Gathergood et al., 2020) we use these same data to show the
heterogeneous impacts of the COVID-19 crisis across UK regions and urban geographies:
splits that are not possible using official statistics.12

Local Lockdowns

We use public data released by the UK government which details the areas affected by
local lockdowns, including the dates of introduction and cessation of lockdown measures.
Each week Public Health England publishes a COVID-19 Surveillance Report that includes
‘The Watchlist’ showing the incidence (and trend) of COVID-19 in local government areas
(lower tier local authorities), whether household mixing is prohibited and lists areas on
the watchlist.13 Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have comparable data that we
gather.14
Areas are added to the Watchlist considering a variety of metrics using professional
judgment of UK public health officials according to the UK Government’s COVID-19
Contain Framework’.15 Areas on the Watchlist fit into one of three categories:
• Concern Areas - Local area is taking targeted actions to reduce COVID-19’s
prevalence (e.g. additional testing in care homes and increased community engagement
with high risk groups).
• Enhanced Support Areas - More detailed plan agreed with the national team
and with additional resources being provided to support the local team to control
COVID-19 (e.g. epidemiological expertise, additional mobile testing capacity).

• Intervention Areas (‘Local Lockdowns’) - Divergence from the measures in
place in the rest of England because of the significance of COVID-19’s spread,
with a detailed action plan in place, and local resources augmented with a national
support to control COVID-19.
For this research we focus on local lockdowns. By September 2020, approximately
one in four people in the UK were subject to a local lockdown. A key feature of such
lockdowns is imposing restrictions on household mixing (e.g. preventing a tea party in
someone’s house) but permitting visits to more COVID-19 secure settings (e.g. having
tea outdoor at a restaurant with strict hygiene and social distancing standards) in order
to encourage consumers to keep spending while also trying to contain the virus. Across
the local lockdowns there was variation in the how much household mixing was restricted
(e.g. in Caerphilly residents were not supposed to leave nor new people come in).16 This
contrasts with the March 2020 lockdown where there was a stay at home order not only
preventing household mixing but also closing all non-essential shops and banning public
activities (e.g. sports).
There were also nationwide (including in areas subject to local lockdowns) government
financial incentives to encourage consumers to spend for much of the period of time we
study. The most notable of these were cuts to sales taxes (Value Added Tax, VAT) on
food, accommodation and attractions from 20% to 5% from July 2020 until January 2021
and ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme offering a 50% discount (up to £10 per person on
food and non-alcoholic drink) for eating out Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays during
August 2020.

Methodology

We use a difference-in-difference methodology to estimate the relationship between local
lockdowns and daily consumption. The use and challenges of difference-in-differences
to estimate causal effects in COVID-19 is summarized in Goodman-Bacon and Marcus
16

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-52934822

9

(2020). Our estimates provide a description of the evolution of COVID-19 cases and
consumer spending pre- and post-lockdown on lockdown affected cities and comparison
areas. We do not interpret our estimates as showing causal relationships - our comparison
cities are not perfect counterfactuals for the evolution of COVID-19 cases or consumer
spending in the absence of a lockdown.
We isolate the date local lockdowns were announced for each locality. There was
great uncertainty in both where and when such lockdowns would be introduced and the
precise restrictions that they would require - as reported in news reports at the time. Some
anticipatory behavior is possible given the data on covid cases was regularly published and
reported on but as the threshold for intervention was low areas often suddenly appeared
subject to local lockdowns - most notably in the case of Manchester where the mayor
and city council were taken by surprise.17 Table A1 lists the timing of local lockdown
announcements, the local authorities affected and the control group localities to compare
against. Where there are multiple localities in the same area subject to a lockdown
announcement on the same day we aggregate data (e.g. South and North Lankarkshire
to Lanarkshire) into a single ‘local authority group’. For some areas subject to local
lockdowns (e.g. Belfast) no suitable control group city exists.
We display descriptive results for thirteen pairs of treatment and control localities –
but primarily focus on the Manchester lockdown as that has a large sample, Liverpool
offers a good control, the announcement was sudden and unexpected (being announced
9.15pm on a Thursday to coming into effect at midnight) and the case is particularly
informative for considering the effects of a London lockdown.18 The other areas studied
that were subject to local lockdowns are: Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bolton, Caerphilly,
Glasgow, Greater Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Leeds, Leicester, Newcastle, Preston and Wolverhampton.
For consumption measures, we allocate spending based on cardholder’s address except
for considering large store chains where we estimate results based on store location. For
COVID-19 cases allocation is as provided based on case reporting localities.
We first describe the time series for spending in these regions. A standard differences17

in-differences approach uses a parsimonious regression estimation approach, such as that
presented in (Equation 1). The outcome of interest Yg,t is offline credit card spending
measured as changes in an index of yearly changes in 7 day moving average of spending.
The unit of observation is a day (t) for each local authority group (g) either subject to
the local lockdown or the control group to compare it to.

Yg,t = α + β T reatg + δt T reatg ∗ Af tert + γt + εg,t

(1)

To explain our methodology we draw upon the example of Manchester. Manchester
is the treated group (T reatg = 1) subject to the local lockdown and we use a ‘similar
area’ – Liverpool – as a control group (T reatg = 0). These areas were chosen as cities of
comparable size, in the same part of the country and showing similar pre-trends. Af tert
is an indicator equal to one if the time period is after the local lockdown announcement.
(T reatg ∗ Af tert ) is the interaction of the above two terms: it is an indicator equal
to one if the time period is after the local lockdown announcement and the area is in
the treated group. The difference-in-difference estimation approach allows for these areas
to have different time-invariant relationships with consumption (α for Liverpool and
α + β for Manchester) and γt is a series of daily dummies (with t = −1 omitted) to
control for any common time-varying factors (e.g. national changes in COVID-19 cases,
economic policies). δt provides an estimate for the relationship between local lockdown
and consumption.
To better understand the local lockdowns we modify Equation 1 to estimate a dynamic
specification creating weekly dummies (Af terW,g ) for the weeks preceding (W ∈ {−3, −2,
−1, 0}) and following (W ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}) the lockdown announcement where the omitted
weekly dummy (W = 0) is the seven days preceding the local lockdown announcement
(t = −7 to t = −1) and we use data up to four weeks pre- and post-lockdown (where
available). We focus on a short time window given the volatile period we study the control
groups are likely to become less suitable comparisons over time - including the subsequent
government introduction of a system of tiered lockdowns in the autumn meaning no
untreated control group remained. We estimate this using an OLS regression weighting
11

observations by their 2019 resident population and cluster standard errors by region (with
one observation per treatment group per day).19

We regard our estimation approach as providing informative, descriptive real-time
evidence to inform policymakers. For these to be interpreted as causal effects for the effect
of local lockdown on local spending would require a ‘common trends’ assumption that,
for example, in the absence the Manchester local lockdown, consumption in Manchester
would have followed the common trend to that in Liverpool. Such an assumption is
unlikely to hold in these data - particularly over longer time horizons there may be
spillovers between areas and other government measures being introduced - hence we
interpret our short-term results as helpful descriptive evidence which might strongly
suggest a causal relationship, due to what is known more generally about virus transmission
and the efficacy of social distancing measures.

COVID-19 Cases

We first examine the effects of local lockdowns on COVID-19 cases. The descriptive
results are displayed in Figure 1. Vertical dotted lines display the timing of the national
lockdown in March 2020 (affecting both treatment and control groups) and the local
lockdown (day 0 when it was announced) that only affects the (yellow) treatment areas
not the (black) control localities.
There are clear pre-lockdown differences in case data between lockdown areas and
comparison areas, with lockdowns being introduced following a sharp increase in the case
rate in each of the city graphs shown. The higher pre-lockdown case rate in lockdown
areas may partially reflect a policy choice by health authorities whereby more tests are

purposefully carried out in areas the government is considering introducing local lockdown
restrictions. This is consistent with what we observe in COVID-19 positive cases as a
percent of tests, however, such data are only available weekly and at a higher level of
geographic region (upper rather than lower tier local authority) that does not align to
areas subject to local lockdowns.
We observe cases continue to rise after the lockdown announcement – as would be
expected given the disease’s incubation period – but typically find that following the
lockdown announcement the rise in cases ceases, case numbers peak and then level-off
or decline. This therefore indicates that local lockdowns can be effective at containing
COVID-19 outbreaks. However, while this is generally the case the results are heterogeneous
with some exceptions to this – most notably Bolton and Glasgow where cases continued
to rise after local lockdowns were imposed.
We estimate the relationship between local lockdowns and the evolution of cases using
a difference-in-difference regression model. While our estimates should be interpreted
as descriptive, we limit the sample for lockdown cases for which the pre-lockdown data
indicates that the comparison geography appears to be a relatively suitable control for the
treatment locality.20 This leads us to drop Bolton and Leicester as there were far sharper
rises in COVID-19 incidences before the lockdown than for their control groups. We
also drop Aberdeen and Caerphilly as we have a relatively small number of transactions
for these areas. Thus we have a remaining sample of six local lockdowns to study:
Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Greater Glasgow, Newcastle and Preston.
The dynamic regression results in Table 1 quantifies the relationship between local
lockdowns and COVID-19 cases. In each case, the coefficient on the local lockdown
dummy the first week post-lockdown is positive, and in most cases remains positive after
two weeks, consistent with local lockdowns being imposed as cases rise towards a spike.
The coefficients at subsequent time horizons fall, in the case of Manchester becoming
negative in period one month after the imposition of the local lockdown.

Roth (2018) highlights the limitations of relying on common pre-trends tests as evidence for common
trends assumption for estimates to be interpreted as causal.

Consumption

Figure 2 summarizes credit card spending for the Manchester local lockdown compared to
the Liverpool control group. Each panel displays different spending measures (using 7 day
moving averages): A. all credit card spending, B. offline credit card spending C. food and
beverage credit card spending D. credit card spending in large store chains. Our findings
are consistent across these measures. A broader set of treatment and control groups pairs
are displayed for the same credit card spending measures in Figure 3 (offline) and Annex
Figures A2 (all), A3 (food and beverage) and A4 (large store chains, 14 day moving
average) - due to smaller sample sizes in some of these areas the series are more volatile
but show consistent results.
We highlight three features from these data. First, the treatment and control regions
have similarly-timed and sized declines in spending in March 2020. The declines in
consumption are economically large though we caveat that there is no control group
unaffected by the virus or national lockdown to estimate the causal effects. Second, the
treatment and control regions typically have similar trends in consumption in the lead up
to the local lockdown being announced. These two features provide supportive evidence
that our controls provide reasonable comparisons for the treatment areas.
Third, we observe little, if any, spending declines following the local lockdowns. While
there is heterogeneity in results with differences in signs and statistical significance across
pairs, a consistent feature is that we can rule out there being any economically large
declines of the magnitude clearly observed (nationally or for these localities) in March
2020.
This descriptive analysis therefore indicates that local lockdowns are not having the
large negative effect on consumption that the first wave of the virus and national lockdown
did. Our dynamic regression results displayed in Table 2 also show this, however, we
caveat it as in some weeks, in some lockdowns spending is lower.

For example in

Manchester, it is no more so than the difference observed pre-lockdown and certainly
nowhere near the spending declines accompanying the March 2020 national shutdown.

Conclusions

We introduce a new real-time source of consumption data that we demonstrate is a highly
correlated, leading indicator of official statistics, is also available at transaction level and
can be disaggregated to produce daily measures across geographies.
Our analysis studies how consumer spending responds to UK local lockdowns using a
difference-in-difference approach, comparing nearby cities or small areas. We do not find
large spending declines in response to these local lockdowns. Instead we find little (if any)
decline in local spending. To help interpret these estimates we observe that they are far
smaller than the credit card spending declines observed nationally or for these localities
during the combination of the first virus wave and national lockdown in March 2020.
Using the same difference-in-difference methodology we find that these local lockdowns
typically appear to turn the tide on rising COVID-19 positive cases.
We thus conclude that it appears possible for policymakers to use such local lockdowns
restricting household mixing to contain COVID-19 outbreaks without killing local economies.
However, we caveat this by noting that the effectiveness of such measures to mitigate the
virus itself are expected to be highly dependent on an effective system of testing to isolate
which regions to lockdown and contain infected individuals. It is also expected to depend
upon co-ordination across regions by governments to ensure outbreaks in one area are
contained and do not spillover into other areas.
While our evidence indicates some initial successes from local lockdowns, the UK
(along with many European countries) experienced a rapid, nationwide rise in COVID-19
cases in late September and October following the end of the summer holidays, reopening
of schools and universities (though the cause of the wave’s sudden rise is not yet clear)
indicating that its system of nationwide containment is not isolating cases early enough
to be effective.
In Autumn and Winter 2020 a series of rapid COVID-19 outbreaks across the UK
(and also other European countries) have since resulted in government imposing new,
more restrictive systems of local and national lockdowns that includes forced business
closures. In Gathergood et al. (2020), we document early evidence on how the measures
20

implemented to November 2020 had unequal effects across UK regions. Whether measures
being imposed in 2021 result in changes to consumption more like the first national
lockdown or the local lockdowns we study here will have profoundly different implications
for the UK economy’s prospects and other countries facing virus outbreaks.
