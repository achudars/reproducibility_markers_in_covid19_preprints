Version 6, October 27th, 2020

Executive Summary: COVID-19 abatement strategies have
risks and uncertainties which could lead to repeating waves of
infection. We show – as proof of concept grounded on rigorous
mathematical evidence – that periodic, high-frequency alternation of into, and out-of, lockdown effectively mitigates secondwave effects, while allowing continued, albeit reduced, economic activity. Periodicity confers (i) predictability, which is
essential for economic sustainability, and (ii) robustness, since
lockdown periods are not activated by uncertain measurements
over short time scales. In turn – while not eliminating the
virus – this fast switching policy is sustainable over time,
and it mitigates the infection until a vaccine or treatment
becomes available, while alleviating the social costs associated
with long lockdowns. Typically, the policy might be in the
form of 1-day of work followed by 6-days of lockdown every
week (or perhaps 2 days working, 5 days off) and it can be
modified at a slow-rate based on measurements filtered over
longer time scales. Our results highlight the potential efficacy
of high frequency switching interventions in post lockdown
mitigation. All code is available on Github1 A software tool
has also been developed so that interested parties can explore
the proof-of-concept system.

Why? The design of post-lockdown mitigation policies
while vaccines are still not available is pressing now as
new secondary waves of the virus have emerged in many
countries (for example, in Spain, France, UK, Italy, Israel,
and others), and as several of these countries grapple with
the reintroduction of full lockdown measures.
What do we do and find? We propose efficacious and
realisable methods to tame the complex behaviour of
COVID-19 in well mixed populations. We achieve this
through a policy of fast intermittent lockdown intervals
with regular period. We illustrate how our approach
offers a fundamentally new perspective on ways to design
COVID-19 exit strategies from policies of total lockdown.
Our theoretical results are also very general and apply to
a wide range of epidemiological models.
What do these findings mean? Unlike many other
proposed abatement strategies, which have risks and
uncertainties possibly leading to multiple waves of infection, we demonstrate that our proposed policies have
the potential to suppress the virus outbreak, while at
the same time allowing continued economic activity.
These policies, while of practical significance, are built
on rigorous theoretical results, which are to the best
of our knowledge, new in mathematical epidemiology.
An extensive validation is carried out using a detailed
epidemic model validated on real COVID-19 data from
Italy and published very recently in Nature Medicine.

I NTRODUCTION
The rapid spread of COVID-19 in early 2020 forced
governments to move rapidly into a prolonged lockdown to
curb the spread of the virus [1], [2], [3]. Many governments
have already expended enormous economic resources in
dealing with the societal, health, economic, and other costs
of this first lockdown [4]. Furthermore, the resulting high
emotional cost placed on society is likely to make future
lockdowns of this type more and more difficult to realise
with high levels of compliance. Hence, a major issue is
whether it is possible to design new lockdown strategies, in
a manner that manages the virus, that places less emotional
stress on populations, and at the same time, allows significant
economic activity [5], [6], [8]. Indeed, economists are
currently pursuing in depth analyses of the complexities and
tradeoffs of lockdowns [7].
Several kinds of COVID-19 abatement strategies are currently
implemented worldwide. These include: (i) contact tracing
with/without testing; (ii) social distancing; and (iii) the
possible introduction in some jurisdictions of immunity
passports [9]. As a complement to these measures, several
governments are considering using intermittent lockdown
interventions driven by measured clinical data (such as
demand on health care facilities, for example), new waves
of COVID-19 emerge [10]; see for example the local
lockdown in Leicester, England [11]. In this respect, one
of the great difficulties in designing intermittent lockdown
policies based on real-time measurements comes from the
many sources of uncertainty that surround the COVID-19
disease. These include: the delays and uncertainties of the
available measurements; the time taken for an individual to
become symptomatic, to become infectious, and to recover;
the infection pathways (aerosols, surfaces); the proportion
and infectivity of asymptomatic individuals, and many other
factors. A further source of uncertainty is related with the
unknown transmission between groups in different geographic
areas and/or different geographic groups. All of these
uncertainties are exacerbated by the exponential growth rate
of the epidemic. Together, uncertainty, delay and exponential
growth, make any data-driven timing of lockdown, as well as
the optimal timing of release-from lockdown, very difficult to
determine (as we shall see later).
The proof-of-concept strategy addressed in this work refers
to a class of robust periodic pulsed intervention policies to
mitigate a post lockdown epidemic while allowing economic
activity. These intervention policies act on the evolution of the
epidemic by orchestrating society at relatively short intervals
into, and out-of, lockdown with a switching period which is
independent from measurement. It is important to note that
pulsed interventions have been dealt with in several works in
epidemiology. For example, there is strong empirical support
for using switching mitigation strategies in other related
contexts if we refer to studies on recurrent seasonal infectious
diseases such as influenza or childhood infectious diseases
(measles, chickenpox, mumps) where change of seasons has

been shown to induce recurrent epidemic dynamics, that are
often annual in pattern. It is also worth noting that empirical
and theoretical studies have confirmed that the switching
theory – as a model of seasonal forcing – is appropriate,
as can be found discussed and modelled in numerous
epidemiological papers (see, for instance [12], [13], [14]).
Indeed, periodic vaccination policies and periodic quarantines
for viral epidemics are discussed in [15], [16], [17]. A notable
difference between these and our work is however that
we propose, and theoretically justify, switching over much
shorter time scales. Very recently in the context of COVID-19
pandemic, irregular aperiodic ON-OFF triggered quarantine
policies, with long lockdown periods, are proposed in the
influential paper [10]. According to this study, surveillance
triggers should be based on the testing of patients in critical
care (intensive care units, ICUs), with quarantine triggered
whenever the number of critical care hospital beds rises above
a given threshold. However, we argue that this aperiodic
policy is not robust as it suffers from the above-mentioned
uncertainties [2] which can themselves generate instabilities
and secondary waves, as will be demonstrated (see the
Discussion section). In particular, we also argue that the
unknown onset of lockdowns and their unknown duration,
arising from such policies, make sustained economic activity
difficult.
Our findings illustrate that regular and repeated short periods
of lockdown, followed by even shorter periods of normal
activity (or ”opening up”), which may be effective and robust
in mitigating the epidemic should a second wave occur.
Further, they also allow for sustained and planned economic
activity. In addition, our theoretical results provide – for the
first time – a solid and rigorous ground to this high-frequency
pulsed intervention policy. One embodiment of this might,
for example, be repeating a week where one normal workday
is followed by lockdown for the next six days of the week.
Importantly, these regular periodic lockdown strategies are
robust with respect to uncertainty as lockdown periods are
not triggered by measurements as in [10], but rather are
driven by predictable periodic time-driven triggers in- and
out- of lockdown. We support our findings by an extensive
validation using a very recent COVID-19 compartmental
SIR-like mass-action model (SIDARTHE) (see [18]) derived
from clinical data from the most affected region in Italy
(Lombardy). In this respect, it is worth remarking that the
use of SIR-like models for qualitative validation of switching
on and off the lockdown phase is currently widely used (see,
for example the very recent paper [6] and the work [19]
presenting the SEPIAHQRD model), and does indeed capture
viral transmission in a well mixed population. Furthermore,
models of this type are also readily extended to multiple
societal and geographic compartments.
The theoretical results that we derive formalise the intuition
that pulsing results in an average epidemic behaviour that
is, in a sense, between that associated with lockdown and
that associated with normality. As we shall show, judiciously
choosing the policy’s period and the relative number of

3

lockdown days within each period induces an average
behaviour that makes it possible to drive the epidemic
towards the desired compromise between economic activity
and epidemic growth. It is worth noting that many theoretical
and empirical studies have found that switching may be
modelled by a weighted average of the two reproductive
numbers (see, for example, [13], [20], [21], [22]). Most of
these studies show that the stability of the model’s infection
free equilibrium (and thus the appearance of an epidemic
outbreak or not) is dependent on the weighted average of the
reproductive numbers. Our theoretical results go far beyond
this elementary analysis and show that the epidemic trajectory
itself is completely governed by the weighted average. In
particular, we show that switching with periods of the order
of days is sufficient to force the system to behave in a manner
that approximates infinitely fast switching, giving rise to
an average epidemic that can be engineered in a rigorous
manner. We also note that while basing triggering policies
on instantaneous data is dangerous precisely because data are
very uncertain (for examples hospitalisations may lag actual
number of infections in the population by several weeks), over
longer periods, uncertain data can be averaged, thus revealing
long-term trends, such as whether mean levels of infections
are increasing or decreasing. Our results demonstrate that
effective policies can be found over time by carefully using
the averaged data to adjust the specific number of workdays
and lockdown days, at a very slow rate, to respond to
both uncertainties in the measurements, and changes in the
virus dynamics while the policy frequency remains fixed.
Specifically, the characteristics of this open-loop intervention
policy – number of lockdown versus working days over a
specified short period – are modulated at a slow-rate by
an outer supervisory control loop. The supervisor performs
this adaptation by integrating and smoothing real empirical
(not generated by a prediction model) COVID-19 related
measurements (hospital admissions, deaths, positive tests)
gathered over a longer time periods. It can therefore be
designed to be robust and not suffer from the time-delays and
the uncertainties inherent in the observations.

As a final comment, we note that since originally becoming
available in March 2020 [23], the idea of fast periodic switching to abate COVID-19 has also been adopted and developed
by several other well known groups in theoretical biology [24],
[25], [26]. With regard to these latter papers, we emphasize
that the unique contributions of our work are four-fold. First, to
the best of our knowledge, we were the first group to propose
this strategy in [23], predating other studies of this kind.
Second, we give tight theoretical results to justify and inform
the design of the switching strategy. Third, a supervisory outer
loop design is proposed to account for the model uncertainties
that is based on rigorous control theoretic concepts. Finally,
our validation simulation study provides a rigorous exploration
of the proposed strategy, and presents a suite of methods that
can be used by policy makers to better inform decisions in
fighting COVID-19.

R ESULTS
The work [1] is just one of many recent publications
confirming that the prolonged lockdown policies put in place
by different governments in eleven European countries led to
a major decrease of the COVID-19 outbreak growth rate in
the respective countries (see also [27], [28], [29] regarding
China, Italy, Spain, and UK). However, official governmental
data also tell that these lockdown periods came with severe
socio-economic consequences making extended lockdown
periods unsustainable (as an example, refer to p. 2 of the
USA Bureau of Labor Report [31] where it is mentioned that
in the USA 5.2 million people in August 2020 were prevented
from looking for work due to the pandemic and also refer
to p. 1 of the EU Eurostat Report [32] in which the flash
estimate for the first quarter of 2020 has GDP down by 3.8%
in the euro area and by 3.5% in the EU compared with the
first quarter of 2019). Hence, a compromise between virus
outbreak mitigation and economical growth has to be sought.
Since pulsed intervention policies have been empirically
shown to be effective in epidemiology (see references in
the introductory remarks), our starting point for our study
is the question whether fast alternation of lockdown and
normal society functioning would yield this compromise?
We demonstrate that by modifying the epidemic’s dynamics
towards an average behaviour, a Fast Periodic Switching
Policy (FPSP) leads to the above-mentioned compromise.
In what follows we organise this part of the paper in several
sections to illustrate our proposed policy, and our main findings. In Part (i), we present our main idea, the FPSP policy.
In Part (ii) we give a description of the theoretical justification
of this policy. In Parts (iii) and (iv) we discuss the design of
the outer supervisory control loop. Finally in Parts (v) and (vi)
we describe the SIDARTHE model and discuss the efficacy of
the overall strategy.
(i) The Fast Periodic Switching Policy (FPSP)
After an initial phase in which the virus started infecting a
completely susceptible population without any constraint, a
prolonged lockdown has been enforced in several countries
with the goal of substantially reducing contacts between
individuals, reducing transmission pathways for the virus
to spread, and thereby suppressing the epidemic. The basic
idea is to apply FPSP at a given time t0 after such a
prolonged lockdown, with the assumption that in lockdown,
the dynamics of the spread of virus are such that the virus is
mitigated.
The application of the FPSP consists of allowing society to
function as normal for X days, followed by social isolation
of Y days (in short, this FPSP is denoted as [X, Y ]).
This is then repeated in every subsequent time-interval
[tk , tk+1 ), k ≥ 1, at a given constant and suitably-high
frequency 1/T , with T = tk+1 − tk = X + Y denoting the
period (hence the fast periodic nature of the switching policy).

4

To explain how FPSPs affect the behaviour of the epidemic,
we make use of the important epidemiological index, the
basic reproductive number R0 , which characterises the
number of secondary infected cases produced by a typical
infected person in a fully susceptible population. It is well
known that the virus grows if R0 > 1, and an outbreak
ensues [37]. It is important to also note that even when the
population is not fully susceptible, a sufficient condition for
disease die-out is mathcalR0 < 1. In our setting, we denote
by R+
0 > 1 the basic reproductive number of the uncontrolled
+
outbreak, and by R−
0 < 1 < R0 the one induced by a
permanent lockdown policy. It turns out that, by alternating
sufficiently-fast lockdown days and normal work days, the
FPSP [X, Y ] is able to modify the reproductive number
+
of the epidemic to a given R∗0 ∈ (R−
0 , R0 ), whose exact
value directly depends on the duty-cycle DC. Our theoretical
results demonstrate that the epidemic trajectory itself follows
closely, at each time, that generated by a model with no
switching, but with growth given by the weighted average
R∗0 (the convergence to the weighted average R∗0 under the
action of the FPSP is strictly related to the already-mentioned
fact that switching may be modelled by a weighted average
of the two reproductive numbers [13], [20], [21], [22]).
Further, it is worth noting that our FPSP mitigation strategy
is also grounded on recent experiences of the single-shot
interventions that were successful in cities and countries
around the world. Detailed assessments are still underway,
but through lockdowns many countries were able to reduce
the reproductive number to R0 < 1. (In [6] it is mentioned
that cities in China were able to reduce their R0 from

2.5 down by 50% − 85% and several countries have now
reduced their R0 ≃ 2 to no growth situation R0 < 1 as in
Australia under lockdown, for instance. Indeed, for eleven
European countries, Flaxman et al. [1] estimate that the
average lockdown R0 of 0.44 [0.26-0.61] for Norway to 0.82
[0.73-0.93] for Belgium, and on average an 82% reduction
compared to pre-intervention values).

As formally shown later, pulsing at high frequency is
important because high-frequency pulsed policies make the
epidemic dynamics similar to that of an average epidemic
characterised by a growth rate which is a weighted average of
that during lockdown days and that under normal functioning
days. This may seem an obvious observation. However, it is
not. It is well known from the theory of switched systems
[33] that switching may introduce instabilities, or even chaotic
behaviour, into a dynamical systems, even when switching
between subsystems that are benign and well behaved.
Indeed, even when the switching system is well behaved,
switching may give rise to oscillatory behaviour, or chattering
behaviour, depending on the nature of the switching. A
remarkable result in the context of our work is that switching
over time-scales of days gives rise to this latter behaviour,
and that the epidemic can essentially be “designed” to die-out
in a pre-specified manner, by adjusting the parameters of our
switching policy [33]. More specifically, we show that an
averaged epidemic can be realised as follows. The weighted
average growth rate is determined by the policy’s duty-cycle
DC = X/T = X/(X + Y ), that is, the relative number of
non-lockdown days on each period. The approximation error,
i.e. the difference between the actual epidemic dynamics
under the pulsed policy and that of the average epidemic,
decreases at least linearly as the policy period decreases.
In turn, our results show that higher frequencies outperform
lower ones in terms of epidemics growth.

Fig. 1: Convergence of FPSP policies and R0 : (Top) Timebehaviour of a 7-days FPSP policy with [X, Y ] = [1, 6] with
a single workday followed by six days lockdown. In the first
20 days (see the vertical orange dashed line) the virus invades
a totally susceptible population generating a major epidemic
with reproductive number R+
0 = 2.404. From the end of
week 3 to the end of week 6 a major lockdown is enforced
reducing the reproductive number to R−
0 = 0.42. The FPSP is
initiated in week 7 (see the vertical dashed light blue line). The
epidemic has a trajectory that approximates that of a system
with average R∗0 = 0.734. (Bottom) Time-behaviours generated by five FPSPs of increasing frequency (corresponding to
periods T ranging from 5 to 1 weeks) and the same duty-cycle
DC = 1/7 = 2/14 = 3/21 = 4/28 = 5/35 ≃ 14.3%. In all
cases, the epidemic behaviour seen in the first three weeks
is suppressed and the outbreak dies out following closely the
trajectory of an un-switched system with R∗0 = 0.734 (dashed
blue line). As clearly show in the figure, smaller periods are
associated with a higher vicinity to the average trajectory R∗0
(dashed blue line).
Before proceeding with the theoretical foundations behind the
FPSP, by way of example, we consider the application of
FPSP to a COVID-19 compartmental SIR-like mass-action
model (SIDARTHE) introduced in [18] and that will be
extensively used throughout the paper. The time series of

5

infected individuals for this model is plotted in Fig 1 (Left),
and is produced by applying an FPSP [X, Y ] = [1, 6] policy
allowing in each period 1 workday followed by 6 lockdown
days. In the first 20 days (see the vertical orange dashed line)
the virus invades a totally susceptible population generating a
major epidemic with reproductive number R+
0 = 2.404. From
the end of week 3 to the end of week 6 a major lockdown is
enforced reducing the reproductive number to R−
0 = 0.420.
The application of the FPSP is initiated in week 7 (see the
vertical dashed light blue line). Then – as revealed by the
trajectories in Fig 1 – our argument shows that the overall
behaviour of the epidemic subject to this switching policy
evolves approximately as an epidemic characterised by a re−
productive number of R∗0 = (R+
0 +6R0 )/7 = 0.734 < 1, and
the approximation error decreases when the policy’s frequency
increases. We emphasise that without applying the FPSP, R0
would be greater than one in week 7, and the epidemic would
grow exponentially. Instead, the FPSP ensures R0 < 1 and the
epidemic dies out. Given the asymptotic nature of this result,
it is natural to ask how well the [1, 6] policy approximates R∗0 .
The answer is depicted in Fig 1 (Bottom) showing the timebehaviours generated by five FPSPs of increasing frequency
(corresponding to periods ranging from 5 to 1 weeks) and
same duty-cycle DC = 1/7 = 2/14 = 3/21 = 4/28 =
5/35 ≃ 14.3%: it can be observed that the evolution of
epidemic approximates closer and closer the dynamics of
the average system with no switching. Note, as we have
already mentioned, that periods of one week give a very good
approximation to the average dynamics.
(ii) Theoretical underpinnings of FPSP
We now turn to providing the theoretical ground for FPSPs in
terms of their frequency 1/T and duty-cycle DC in the context
of SIR-like mass-action models. The dynamics of a general
family of compartmental SIR-like models can be described by
a differential equation of the form2
m
X
dx(t)
βi (t)fi [x(t)] ,
= f0 [x(t)] +
dt
i=1

(1)

in which n denotes the dimension of the state space, x(t) ∈ Rn
denotes the state vector, fi : Rn → Rn , i = 0, . . . , m, are
continuously differentiable functions, and βi , i = 0, . . . , m,
are essentially bounded functions with dimensionless values in
[0, 1] that modulate the transfer rates between compartments.
In particular, the functions βi will be used to model the
effect of a lockdown in the dynamics of (1). If βi (t) = 1,
then the lockdown is not enforced and the transfer rates are
maximal. If βi (t) < 1, a lockdown is enforced, and the
2 Equation (1) can be used to describe compartmental models with n
compartments in which each state component xi (t) corresponds to a different
compartment. The value of each xi (t) may represent either the number of
individuals or the percentage of individuals in the i-th compartment. In the
first case, the physical dimension of xi (t) is individuals, in the second case
xi (t) is dimensionless. In passing from a description to the other the functions
fk , k = 0, . . . , m need to be rescaled. In particular, if the functions fk
describe the dynamics of the number of individuals in each compartments,
the corresponding dynamics describing the percentage of individuals is given
by the functions fk′ (·) := fk (N ·)/N . Similarly, passing from percentages to
numbers of individuals requires the inverse scaling fk (·) = N fk′ (·/N ).

transfer rates between any two compartments are reduced
accordingly. For example, a basic SIR model describing the
spread of a virus with time-varying basic/effective reproductive
number in a population of N individuals can be written in
the form of Eq (1), with n = 3, x = (S, I, R), in which
S(t), I(t), R(t) ∈ [0, N ] denote, respectively, the number of
susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, m = 1 and

for some parameters α, σ > 0 modelling, respectively, the recovery rate and the rate of effective contacts between infected
and susceptible individuals. Rates are in 1/day. Here, β1 (t)
modulates the infection rate σ and, thus, the basic/effective
reproductive number. In a similar way, many existing more
comprehensive SIR-like models have dynamics described by
Eq (1) for a suitable choice of the state vector, the integers
n and m, and the functions fi , i = 1, . . . , m. By imposing
lockdown followed by work days, the application of a FPSP
policy to an epidemic described by Eq (1) makes each function
βi to switch between two different values. For simplicity, we
consider the case in which βi+ and βi− are both constant.
We remark, however, that this assumption does not affect the
qualitative claims of the presented theory, and that this comes
without loss of generality, since βi+ and βi− can be taken as
worst-case values. Specifically, we can write
 +
 βi during non lockdown days
(society functioning as normal)
βiFPSP (t) =
 −
βi during lockdown and social isolation ,
(3)
for some βi+ , βi− ∈ [0, 1] satisfying βi+ ≥ βi− . Typically,
βi+ = 1, which corresponds to an unmitigated infection rate.
If other mitigation measures are in place, such as mandatory
use of face masks or social distancing policies, then βi+ may
be smaller than 1. The switching period T and the dutycycle DC are defined by the particular pair [X, Y ] identifying
the particular FSPS policy (recall that T = X + Y and
DC = X/T ). For each i = 1, . . . , m, we define the average
mode βi∗ as the weighted average between the two modes βi+
and βi− , namely:
βi∗ := DC · βi+ + (1 − DC) · βi− .
The value of βi∗ equals the weighted mean value of βi over
each period interval of time of length T . As clear from the definition, βi∗ may coincide with any value in the interval [βi− , βi+ ]
∗
) and
for a suitable duty-cycle DC. Letting β ∗ = (β1∗ , . . . , βm
referring to the differential model (1) obtained with β(t) = β ∗ ,
the average dynamics is characterised by the model

For a given FPSP policy characterized by the pair [X, Y ],
and with βiFPSP defined by Eq (3) for each i = 1, . . . , m,
denote by xFPSP the unique solution to Eq (1) originating
at xFPSP

FPSP
βi (t) = βi

applying the FPSP policy. Likewise, denote by x∗ the unique
solution to Eq (4) originating at x∗0 := x∗ (0) at time t =
0. Then, we show that (see Theorem 1 and its proof in the
Methods section), for every time instant τ ≥ 0, there exist
a1 , a2 ≥ 0, such that the following bound holds:

eral SIDARTHE SIR-like mass-action model [18] dynamics is
described by the following state equations:

(iv) Overview of outer loop properties
The basic design principle justifying the outer loop (6)-(7) is
very well-known in the control community under the name of
“hysteresis” or “thermostat” based control (see, for instance,
[48], [47]). In fact, it is a well-established control scheme that,
due to its implementation simplicity and robustness to delays
and uncertainties, boasts numerous industrial applications (see,
for instance, [49], [47] and the references therein). In this
specific context, under the assumption that the effect of each
duty-cycle on the growth rate of the measurements O(t) is
stationary for a long enough time – meaning that a given
duty-cycle has the same effect on the measured signal in a
large enough time-span – one can show that the sequence
{(X(tk ), Y (tk ))}k∈N of pairs produced by the outer loop (6)(7) enjoys the following properties:
P1: If the set A of pairs (X, Y ) for which both inequalities
ψX (t) ≤ 0,

ψY (t) ≤ 0,

∀t ≥ 0

hold is non-empty, then {(X(tk ), Y (tk ))}k∈N converges,
in a fixed-time bounded by T , to A.
P2: If A is empty – meaning that each possible dutycycle is either stabilising or destabilising – then
{(X(tk ), Y (tk ))}k∈N may instead oscillate between stabilising and destabilising pairs.
By suitably tuning the parameters αX and αY , one can
adjust the average steady-state effect of the sequence
{(X(tk ), Y (tk ))}k∈N to ensure that, in both the aforementioned cases, the net effect of the steady-state outer loop
decision is always stabilising. Moreover, one may always
increase the number of possible duty-cycles (if necessary
by increasing T ) to guarantee that A =
6 ∅. Finally, it is
worth observing that, under the assumption that the infected
individuals always develop immunity, the measurement signal
O(t) eventually decreases to zero. Therefore, the same holds
for ψX (t) and ψY (t). In view of Eq (6), this in turn implies
that the sequence of duty-cycles produced by the outer loop
always stops to an equilibrium value.

(v) The SIDARTHE class of models
The intuition underpinning the proposed control methodology
stems from a thorough analysis of the nonlinear dynamics
of SIR-type dynamic models of epidemics for well mixed
populations. While we have tested our FPSP approach on
a portfolio of related models (deterministic and stochastic
SIQR/SEIR, as well as agent based models) our principal
tool of validation reported here is the SIDARTHE model. By
way of background, the SIDARTHE model was developed in
response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy in early
Spring 2020, and all our parameter values are based on those
identified in the context of this work. It thus represents a stateof-the art model of the spread on COVID-19. Specifically, gen-

the recognized people, corresponding to the symptomatic
detected cases; T represents the threatened people, corresponding to the detected cases with life-threatening symptoms;
H represents the healed people; E represents the extinct
population. Moreover, the parameters σ1 , σ2 , σ3 and σ4 denote
the transmission rates from the susceptible state to any of the
four other infected states; the parameters σ5 and σ10 denote
the rates of detection of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic
cases; the parameters σ6 and σ8 denote the rates by which
(asymptomatic and symptomatic) infected subjects develop
clinically relevant symptoms; the parameters σ11 and σ13
denote the rates with which (undetected and detected) infected
subjects develop life-threatening symptoms; the parameter
σ16 denotes the mortality rates for people who have already
developed life-threatening symptoms; the parameters σ7 , σ9 ,
σ12 , σ14 and σ15 denote the rates of recovery for the five
classes of infected subjects (including those in life-threatening
conditions). All the rates are in 1/day. Finally, N denotes
the total size of the population and, as in (1), β modulates
the rate of effective contacts between infected and susceptible
individuals. For constant values of β, in this case of the

The numerical values of the parameters are identified by [18]

0.011, σ5 = 0.171, σ6 = 0.125, σ7 = 0.034, σ8 = 0.125,
σ9 = 0.034, σ10 = 0.371, σ11 = 0.012, σ12 = 0.017, σ13 =
0.027, σ14 = 0.017, σ15 = 0.017, and σ16 = 0.003. Again,
rates have dimension 1/day.
(vi) Efficacy of FPSP and slow outer feedback loop
To begin with, in the validation simulations considered here
we note that the function β takes the values β − = 0.175 or
β + = 1, respectively, in case a lockdown is enforced or not.
The value β + = 1 represents the case in which no mitigation
measure is in place when lockdown is not enforced, while
the value β − = 0.175 is chosen according to [18]. Finally,
the total population is set to3 N = 107 and the initially
infected population is set to approximately 0.1% of N . Three
subsequent simulation phases are considered: (i) for t < 20
days, the virus spreads with no containment measures and in
this phase β(t) = β + = 1; (ii) for 20 ≤ t < 50 days, a strict
lockdown is enforced and in this phase β(t) = β − = 0.175;
(iii) for t ≥ 50 days (on t = 50 days the number of infected
people has sufficiently decreased) our FPSP is activated, and
β(t) oscillates between β − and β + according to the chosen
duty-cycle.
The results shown in Figs 2, 3, 4, and 5 reveal the
effectiveness of the FPSP strategy and are in accordance
with the theoretical results reported above. Fig 2 indicates
that some switching policies are highly effective, whereas
others are not. For example, in all scenarios, policies with a
29% duty-cycle (the [2, 5] policy in the case of a one week
period) out-perform the 43% policy (the [3,4] policy in the
3 We use N = 107 to be consistent with [18] in which the above parameters
are identified. Nevertheless we remark that, being (8) a “mean-field” model,
the population size is not important for the qualitative behaviour of the
simulation.

case of a one week period). In fact, provided that the period
T is sufficiently small, the infection decays as long as the
weighted average R∗0 remains below 1 thus making the policy
a success. In contrast, for R∗0 > 1 the infection initially grows
exponentially and the policy fails.
In the right-hand panels of Figs 2, each panel shows the
epidemic dynamics for different periods T , from T = 2 weeks
to T = 4 weeks. We see that for a fixed value of the dutycycle, increasing the period T yields a larger growth of the
infection, although the time-series remain qualitatively similar.
Starting from the same above-mentioned initial condition
(approximately 0.1% of the total population N = 107 ), we
offer Figs 3 and 4 which provide a comprehensive analysis
of the effect of a wide spectrum of open-loop FPSP policies
in terms of the induced value and time-location of the
infection peak. Specifically, Fig 3 deals of a selection of a
few significant choices of duty-cycles and periods aiming at
giving a qualitative understanding of the main trends of the
infection as function of the chosen duty-cycle and period
of the FPSP policy. Moreover, a few time-behaviours of the
epidemic are shown. Fig 4 provides the full-picture of this
analysis for a very large selection of different duty-cycles and
periods. In particular, with reference to Fig 4, in the top-left
panel for each policy we show the maximum number of
infected people (i.e., the maximum value of the total infected
population I(t) + D(t) + A(t) + R(t) + T (t)) attained after
the preliminary lockdown phase is released and the FPSP
policy is enforced (i.e. after t = 50 days). This is plotted
as a function of the period T of the policy used. Recall
that for successful policies, decreasing T should improve
the approximation we make use of. In the bottom-left panel,
instead, we show the time at which such infection peak is
attained. The “stable” policies, which are those inducing a
monotonically decreasing infection trajectory after t = 50
days, attain their peak close to the starting time t = 50
days, and a peak value close to the starting infection value.
The “unstable” policies, which are those obtained for large
duty-cycles or large periods and inducing no mitigation
effect, attain the infection peak quite early, and induce a very
large peak value. The “middle” policies, which are those
lying in-between the stable and unstable ones, show instead
a mixed behaviour with possibly large peak-times. Again, a
wide variation in the performance of policies can be observed.
In particular, for similar values of the duty-cycle, which
are associated with similar values of R∗0 , we can see that
larger periods are associated with an exponential decrease
of performance. As mentioned earlier, this is consistent
with the presented results, and in particular with the bound
provided by Equation (5), and it reflects the fact that
larger periods yield coarser approximations of the averaged
trajectory x∗ . Therefore, only for small enough period T , the
reproductive number R∗0 gives a good indication of the actual
behaviour of the epidemic under the action of the FPSP policy.

the time-behaviour of the epidemic for two choices of the period and four choices of the duty-cycle. These time-trajectories
correspond to policies belonging to the two red rectangles shown at the bottom-left of the top-left panel.

duty-cycles (e.g., blue diamonds in bottom diagrams denote policies with a duty-cycle between 20% and 25%) as seen in the

increased period length for fixed duty-cycles. (Bottom-Left) shows that peak-times are small for policies attaining small and

these policies lie in the region of smallest peak-value (also, see Fig 5).

Fig. 6: Illustrative scheme of the proposed mitigation strategy: (Green) an example of an FPSP with period T = 7 days
(one week) is shown on the left in which two consecutive periods with [X, Y ] = [1, 6] corresponding to a duty-cycle DC =
1/7 ≃ 14.3% (green box on the left) and a subsequent period with a different FPSP policy [X, Y ] = [2, 5] corresponding to a
duty-cycle DC = 2/7 ≃ 28.5% are shown (dashed orange box). The application of this FPSP influences the actual dynamics
of the epidemics as shown on the right (long left-right arrow on the top). (Orange) delayed and possibly uncertain empirical
measurements are collected (green box on the right) and used by the adaptive outer supervisory controller to select the specific
FPSP policy (bottom right to left orange arrow) to be used in the subsequent time-period (bottom to top vertical orange arrow
pointing to the new FPSP policy in the dashed orange box).

14

Fig 5 depicts the efficacy of augmentation of the open-loop
policies with a slow outer loop. Here, convergence to a
good policy can be clearly observed. Notice that we consider
time periods of at least two weeks in order to take into
account that the incubation period for the disease can be
as large as 14 days. However, notice also that the update
involves exclusively the duty-cycle of the FPSP and nothing
prevents, for instance, to employ instead of a [3, 11] policy,
a [2, 5] and a [1, 6] policy over the course of two weeks.
Fig 5 also shows that lower frequencies seem to lead to
lower numbers of infected people: this is only an apparent
contradiction with the previous findings. Lower frequencies
are in fact characterized by much larger convergence times
(e.g., approximately 10 weeks for T = 14 against 400 for
T = 28) which, in turn, lead to a lower duty-cycle value for
longer periods than higher frequencies.

We conclude the presentation of our results by illustrating in
Fig 6 a schematic view of the overall mitigation strategy we
suggest. First, a period T is fixed once for all. According to
our results and the above discussion, T has to be taken as
small as possible compatibly with societal constraints. Then,
an initial duty-cycle DC is chosen. The pair (T, DC) defines a
FPSP with X = DC · T and Y = T − X. Based on empirical
measurements, the supervisory controller adapts the duty-cycle
– by keeping T fixed – at run time to automatically find
the largest possible duty-cycle keeping the epidemics under
control.

illustrated in the Results section. The following notation
is used: we denote by R and N the set of real and natural
numbers respectively, and we let R≥0 := [0, ∞). The
Euclidean norm on Rn , n ∈ N, is denoted by k · k. With
A, B ⊂ R, L∞ (A, B) denotes the Banach space of (classes of)
Lebesgue measurable functions A → B which are essentially
bounded, endowed with the essential supremum norm
kf k∞ = inf{b ≥ 0 : |f (x)| ≤ b for almost all x ∈ A}.
With f : A → B and g : B → C, g ◦ f : A → C denotes
the composition between f and g. When the argument of
a differentiable function x : R → Rn represents time, for
simplicity its derivative dx / dt is denoted by ẋ. Finally, we
denote by ⌊·⌋ : R≥0 → N the floor function, defined as
⌊a⌋ = max{n ∈ N : n ≤ a}.
With reference to the general dynamics of SIR-like models
described by Equation (1), we prove the following theorem
which establishes a relation between the solutions to Equation (1) obtained when the functions βi have the aforementioned switching behaviour, and the solutions obtained in the
case in which each function βi is given by βi (t) = βi∗ , for
some constant βi∗ ∈ [βi− , βi+ ]. In particular, when each βi is
periodic and has mean value equal to βi∗ , the result of the
theorem states that the solutions obtained with the switching
functions βi remain close to those obtained with βi (t) = βi∗ ,
and the distance between the two decreases linearly with the
switching period on each compact interval of time.

To summarise, Figs 2, 4, and 5 deliver two broad messages.
First, in accordance with our theory, higher frequencies
clearly outperform lower ones in terms of peak-value and
peak-time of infection. In addition, the outer loop always
converges to a feasible and easy-to-implement regular [X, Y ]
policy.

Theorem 1 Let βi− ≤ βi+ be arbitrary. Let K ⊂ Rn be a
compact set that is positively invariant for Eq (1) for every
βi ∈ L∞ (R≥0 ; [βi− , βi+ ]). Then, there exist strictly increasing
functions α1 , α2 , α3 : R≥0 → R≥0 such that, for each
x0 , x∗0 ∈ K, the following holds. For each i = 1, . . . , m,
pick arbitrarily Ti > 0 and βi∗ ∈ [βi− , βi+ ], and let βi ∈
L∞ (R≥0 ; [βi− , βi+ ]) be Ti -periodic. Denote by x the solution
of Eq (1) associated with the initial condition x(0) = x0 and
βi . Similarly, denote by x∗ the solution of Eq (1) associated
with x∗ (0) = x∗0 and βi∗ . Then, for all t ≥ 0, the following
estimate holds:
sup kx(s) − x∗ (s)k ≤ α1 (t)IC + α2 (t)P + α3 (t)A (11)

in which the distance IC between the initial conditions, the
maximal period P, and the maximal distance A between the

Comment A: For ease of interpretation, we make the following comments regarding the above results.
A1: If, for each i = 1, . . . , m, βi is Ti -periodic and has
mean value equal to βi∗ , then in (11), A = 0. If,
moreover, the considered solution obtained with βi and
that obtained with βi∗ start from the same initial condition
(i.e. x0 = x∗0 ), then, in Eq (11), IC = 0. In this case,
Theorem 1 claims that the distance between the two
solutions is proportional only to the maximum period
of the functions βi and thus, it can be decreased by
increasing the frequency 1/Ti of each function βi .
A2: In fact, Theorem 1 implies that, as the switching frequency grows to infinity (i.e., as the switching period
Ti approaches zero), the time evolution of the epidemic
– the dynamics of which is described by Eq (1) –
asymptotically approaches the dynamic behaviour of the
average system

It is worth mentioning that this observation can also
be obtained from general qualitative results for systems
affine in controls. See in particular Theorem 1 in [46].
However, the specific nature of the control policy considered in our framework allows us to derive a quantitative
result taking the form of the explicit bound (11).
A3: Moreover, it is also worth noting that Eq (11) provides
a quantitative estimate of the discrepancy between dynamics driven by the FPSP and the average one given
by Eq (12) for each given switching period Ti . In fact,
the quantity A decreases as Ti decreases thus showing
the benefits of choosing suitably high frequencies when
implementing our FPSP; namely, that fast switching
allows us to control the dynamics of the epidemics in
a precise manner.
Next, we provide a qualitative analysis of the influence of the
initial proportion of infected over the total population N on
the peak of the epidemic outbreak. For simplicity, we focus
on the fundamental SIR dynamics, given by Eq (1) with the
choice (2) for some α, σ > 0. We recall that in this case
x = (S, I, R), in which S(t), I(t) ∈ [0, N ] denote the relative
number of susceptible and infected individuals. Moreover, for
constant values of β1 (t), say β1 (t) = β for some β ∈ [0, 1], the
basic reproduction number reads as R0 = βσ/γ (see [3]). If
R0 > 1, the possible spread of the infection in the population
depends on the initial number of susceptible S(0). Specifically,
a number of susceptible S(0) ≤ N/R0 implies the decrease

of the number of infected I(t) to zero. However, a number
of susceptible S(0) > N/R0 implies an initial growth of the
epidemic. In such a situation, without switching there exists a
(unique) time tp , referred to as the peak time of the epidemic,
such that the number of infected I(t) grows on the time
interval [0, tp ], and then decreases for t ≥ tp converging to
zero. In particular, it can be shown that the maximum number
of infected Ip = I(tp ) is given by

Comment B: Now, we make two comments with a view to
parsing the above result.
B1: It can be seen that the higher the initial number of
infected, the higher the peak Ip .
B2: From the lower bound tp,lb , it can be seen that the smaller
I(0), the larger the peak time tp .
These qualitative results confirm that the timing of the initial
lockdown is crucial. A prompt lockdown makes it possible
to limit the initial number of infected. As a consequence, we
can limit and shift in time the peak of infected. This gives
more time to develop treatments and vaccines while limiting
as much as possible the pressure of the health care system,
and allows more time for measurements to be gathered. This
latter point may be important for the design of feedbackbased mitigation strategies. Moreover, they also may explain
the apparent different dynamics in different countries; namely
that different countries appear to see a peak in infectives at
very different times, even when the epidemic commenced at
roughly the same time.
Additional simulations
Here we present additional simulation results on the
validation of our FPSP strategy using the SIDARTHE model.
As previously stated, the total population is set to N = 107
and the initially infected population is set approximately to
0.1% of N . The simulation setting is the same considered
so far including the parameters of the SIDARTHE model.
Different simulations are obtained for different values of
the period and the duty-cycle. Fig 7 shows the distribution
of the maximum peak-values (in percentage) of infected
people obtained for each model by each [X, Y ] FPSP policy
with X and Y ranging from 0 to 14 (i.e., the value of
(100/N ) · supt≥50 [I(t) + D(t) + A(t) + R(t) + T (t)] for the
SIDARTHE model). Fig 8, instead, shows the time instants
at which such peaks are attained.
The following findings can be ascertained.
• There is a stability region, painted in light blue and
located in the bottom-left part of the images, in which the
peak values are similar to the one we would observe with
a complete lock down, i.e. with any policy in which the

Quarantine Days [Day]

number X of work days is set to zero, and the peak times
are close to the time (t = 50 days) in which the policies
are started. More precisely, with reference to Fig 8, we
observe that a policy [X, Y ] belonging to the stability
region attains the peak at time t ≤ 50 + X. This, in turn,
implies that the trajectory of the total infected population
obtained under these policies starts to decay after the first
X days of the first period. We further underline that,
although two policies belonging to the stability region
have a similar peak value, they may show quite different
behaviours.
There is an instability region, painted in dark blue and
located in the top-right part of the images, in which the
peak values are similar to the one we would observe
without lock down, i.e. with any policy in which the
number Y of quarantine days is set to zero. As the peaktime distributions in Fig 8 shows, the policies belonging
to this instability region do not necessarily lead to the
same time evolution. In fact, policies with more days of
quarantine (i.e., larger Y ) are associated with larger peak
times. This, in turn, implies that more days of quarantine
still have the positive effect of delaying the peak.
There is a compromise region, which contains the remaining policies, and which is located in the central
band going from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.
The policies of this region yield a peak of the number
of infected people which is considerably larger than the
value attained after the initial lockdown phase. However,
they are associated with a larger duty-cycle (i.e. a large
fraction of work days X) than the policies belonging to
the stability region, thus allowing a larger number of work
days.

Quarantine effectiveness.: We present now simulation results
obtained by different levels of quarantine effectiveness under
the action of a [2, 12] FPSP open-loop policy (Fig 9, top) and
of the same policy complemented with the outer loop (Fig 9,
bottom). In particular, in what follows we let β − = qβ + and
we simulate different values of the scaling factor q. The openloop policy remains stabilising for q ≤ 0.335, corresponding
to approximately 66% reduction in the reproduction number
during periodic quarantine days. The outer loop guarantees
improved stabilising properties also for values of q for which
the FPSP open-loop policy is not stabilising (see the case
q = 0.375). It is worth noting that a further increase in value
of q leads to scenarios corresponding to an R0 > 1 during
lockdown periods. In such cases, the outer loop drives the
duty-cycle to 0 which corresponds to a full lockdown situation.

Fig. 7: Percentage of peak infections parametrised by [X, Y ]
in a population of 107 individuals in the SIDARTHE model.

Anticipatory and compensatory population behaviour.: We
now explore following situation. We assume that individuals,
because they are aware that they will be in lockdown for
several days each period, will be more likely to go out
and mix during the non-lockdown periods. Thus, in the
following situations we augment up β + by a factor (1 + d).
Simulation results are presented modelling increased mixing
with a scaling factor (1 + d)β + ≥ 1 during working days
with the [2, 12] open-loop FPSP policy (Fig 10 top), and
complementing this open-loop policy with the outer loop
(Fig 10 bottom), respectively. The open-loop policy remains
stabilising for d ≤ 0.80 but fails to stabilise the epidemic for
d = 1. Instead the outer loop provides improved stabilising
properties and also copes well with the case d = 1.

Sensitivity analysis
This section explores the sensitivity of the number of infected
individuals in the SIDARTHE model (I + D + A + R + T )
with respect to quarantine effectiveness, anticipatory and
compensatory population behaviour, and uncertainty in the
model parameters. Unless stated otherwise, the parameters
have the values previously given. An interactive demonstrator

Policy options with FPSP: One can further characterize the
trade-off between epidemiological parameters, population behavior, and policy decisions using the notion of level sets.
These are parameter configurations that result in an equivalent peak number of simultaneously infected individuals (see
Fig 11). In this manner one may visualise the set of policy
interventions that result in similar levels of peak infection
outcomes. To this end, we estimate the level sets by fitting a
Gaussian Process prior model to the peak infection outcomes
of 1000 sample simulations, where the two parameters under
investigation were sampled from a Sobol sequence using the
software package Ax5 , and all others were held fixed at their
default values as given above. As we have mentioned, identifying equivalent configurations can help policy makers assess
and adjust to the effects of complementary policy decisions
and to changes in population behavior. For example, measures
such as social distancing, that reduce infectivity, may reduce
R0 sufficiently to safely increase the number of working
days per period (Fig 11, left). Conversely, lower compliance
with lockdown restrictions, corresponding to increased q, may
require a decrease in the number of working days to contain
the epidemic.

Unmodelled synchronisation effects
Synchronisation effects may – in principle – affect the design
of the virus mitigation strategy described in the paper. In fact,
there are several possible pathways for such effects to manifest
themselves, all associated with uncertainties. We now briefly
comment on these effects and their potential impact on the
FPSP. Synchronisation between the disease dynamics and the
FPSP policy may emerge due to the following aspects of the
disease dynamics.
(i) The time between exposure and an individual becoming
infective.
(ii) The fact that ODE-based SIR-like models assume a fixed
rate of movement from one compartment to another. This
is an approximation that corresponds to an exponential
distribution. However, recoveries, quarantines, and other
quantities, are in reality governed by a more complex
distribution.
(iii) Interactions between the FPSP policy and the behaviour
of the population (as individuals may be more likely to
go out directly after a lockdown, thereby increasing the
level of social mixing).
(iv) Interactions between the FPSP policy, and possible increase of synchronisation of infections during the open
periods.
There are certainly other sources of interaction in addition to
these. Our rationale for not directly addressing such effects
in our models is related to the following observations. First,
their is considerable uncertainty in quantifying them. For
example, in reality, there is large uncertainty in quantifying
the distribution that governs the transition from an Exposed to
Infected class. There is also huge uncertainty in quantifying
the distribution governing the movements of individuals from
Infected to Quarantine and Susceptible to Infected. Further,
the behavioural aspects of how individuals respond to a
lockdown is also highly uncertain, and likely to be influenced
by many factors, and will also change over time. Second,
different simulations, obtained with models having a more
realistic distribution of the incubation time and infectivity
profile, show that the effects of synchronisation and resonance
are negligible. For the above reasons we decided not to
model such effects and, rather, to rely on simple but wellaccepted models which well-capture the overall qualitative
behaviour, and second to incorporate the “outer-loop” strategy
to automatically mitigate such effects should they ever appear.
In particular, the outer-loop is designed to increase the length
of lockdown, relative to open-days, to supress any instability
that may arise due to unmodelled effects. Notwithstanding
these comments on (the motivation for) the outer loop, we
also make the following specific comments with regard to the
above points.
(a) Our principal validation tool is the SIDARTHE model
which was calibrated using measurements from Lombardy in early Spring, 2020. SIDARTHE corresponds to
a strict generalisation of the SIQR model. The disease
dynamic is very challenging in the SIQR setting. Here,
a susceptible is immediately exposed to infectives, and
the disease grows rapidly. This scenario thus provides a

robust environment for testing the FPSP policy. However, it should also be noted that the performance of
our FPSP policy is not overly sensitive to the specific
assumptions of the adopted model, and may be applied
in other model settings. For instance we have also tested
our policies in SEIQR environments, using stochastic
differential equations, as well as agent based simulations,
in which the exponential rates are replaced by more
realistic distributions, and in which the E class plays a
role in the disease dynamics.
(b) The assumption of exponential departures and arrivals
between classes is, of course, a gross approximation.
In addition to incorporating the outer-loop to mitigate
this uncertainty, a large part of our existing sensitivity
analyses has been concerned with quantifying the impact
of more realistic distributions in our models. These are
reported in the sensitivity analysis.
(c) Finally, in our opinion, the most concerning synchronisation effect may be interactions between the FPSP
policy and the behaviour of the population. In this setting,
behaviour may drive adaption of the FPSP, and adaption
of the FPSP may drive a change in behaviour. There are
however, several aspects of the FPSP policy that may
serve to dampen the impact of this interaction. First,
regular periodic open intervals, with short intervals between these open intervals, may mitigate any interactions
due to reduced urgency with which individuals utilise
open intervals. Second, during open intervals, we expect
both the presence of additional measures, such as the

usage of masks and social distancing policies, and a high
level of compliance in the population with general health
policies to keep the level of mixing to a manageable level.
Such levels of compliance, may of course, be enforced
by policy and law. Moreover, if people compensate by
scheduling all their chores to take place during the nonlockdown days, thus increasing the value of β + , then this
also implies that they are less active during lockdown
days, thus decreasing the value of β − . Since it is the
average of the two values that counts, this leads to a
further damping effect. Finally, interaction of the outer
loop with the population is designed in a manner to drive
the population towards a full lockdown if negative effects
manifest themselves due to increased mixing. Knowledge
of this fact may induce or encourage “good behaviour”
in the population; if it does not, the unstable interaction
between FPSP and the population will drive the system to
an equilibrium that supresses the virus anyway (i.e., the
full lockdown state). Namely, the outer loop guarantees
a safety by enforcing, in the worst case, a full lockdown.
D ISCUSSION AND C ONCLUDING R EMARKS
The main contribution of this paper is to suggest a principled
design methodology for designing non-pharmaceutical virus
mitigation measures based on regular period switching in and
out of lockdowns.
Main findings
Our main findings may be summarised as follows.

21

•

Our main finding is that a considered design of fast,
regular, periodic switching policy (FPSP), in and out
of lockdowns over short time-scales, can suppress
the COVID-19 outbreak, by regulating the average
reproductive number to be below one. This can be
achieved using an open-loop strategy that is not overly
dependent on measurements. This strategy can be used
until a widespread vaccine becomes available.

•

A slow, outer feedback loop, based on averaged
measurements, can be used to tune the FPSP, to account
for unmodelled effects, and possible synchronisation
effects.

•

The FPSP policy allows reduced economic and social
activity, while at the same time abating the virus. Furthermore, the policy is predictable, and thus more amenable
to planned economic activity. This is in contrast to
the ad-hoc, data driven, and unpredictable, intermittent
lockdowns currently being used to fight the pandemic.
FPSP complements other virus mitigation strategies such
as mask coverings and social distancing.
The FPSP strategy is based on a rigorous theoretical
foundation. Mathematical results are presented that characterise the policy and that can be used to design policies
with specific properties. In addition, these policies account for measurement delays that can lead to dynamic
instabilities.

Elaborated discussion
As we write this paper, countries worldwide are experiencing
a major resurgence of COVID-19, and many either have
or are actively considering reintroducing lockdowns to
limit the spread of the virus. It is also understood that the
re-introduction of lockdowns will not be easy. It is also
understood that the re-introduction of lockdowns will not be
easy. Lockdowns place difficult burdens on economies and
societies, and the issue of compliance with lockdown policy is
likely to be a major societal issue as the disease re-emerges.
Thus, in this context, both from a societal and economic
perspective, developing strategies of regular activity, followed
by short lockdowns, makes sense. As we have shown, such
policies can abate the virus to low levels of infectivity, while
also allowing regular social and economic activity, and may
provide tolerable policies for society for the reintroduction
of lockdowns (partial) as countries consider their options in
responding to emerging second waves. We also note that
COVID-19, is characterised by several uncertainties. Using
knowledge from control theory it is possible to account for
these delays and uncertainties. In our case, we suggest the use
of regular periodic intervention policies that are not overly
dependent on real-time measured data. These fast-intermittent
exit strategies are robust with respect to uncertainty as
lockdown periods are not triggered by measurements, but
rather are driven by predictable periodic triggers in- and
out- of lockdown. In addition, as we have mentioned over
longer periods, uncertain data can be averaged, revealing

long-term trends, such as whether mean levels of infections
are increasing or decreasing. As some policies are better than
others, these can be found by carefully using the averaged
data to adjust the specific number of workdays and lockdown
days, at a very slow rate, to respond to both uncertainties in
the measurements, and changes in the virus dynamics over
time.
We note also that classical instabilities are a particular problem
in dealing with dynamic systems with delays, and require
special treatments of the kind that we advocate to alleviate
their effects. This is well known in control theory, but is
worth highlighting in the epidemiological context given the
significant delays and uncertainties associated with COVID19. To illustrate this point consider a very simple lockdown
algorithm (for example, of the type advocated in [10]) that acts
with real time information concerning the epidemic, rather
than delayed information. Suppose a lockdown is initiated
whenever the number of infected individuals in the population,
I(t), exceeds a certain threshold level, say hypothetically
I(t) = 0.002 · N (i.e., 0.2% of the population). In addition
to this, the lockdown is released whenever I(t) falls below
another threshold, say I(t) = 0.001·N . Fig 13 (Left) illustrates
the effects of this procedure, for demonstration purposes on
the most simple SIR model.
The model simulation begins with an epidemic period
in which the number of infected individuals I(t) grows
exponentially until t = 3 weeks, at which point a lockdown
is implemented. Because of the lockdown, R0 < 1, and the
epidemic rapidly declines until it falls below the threshold
I(t) = 0.001 · N at t = 8 weeks and therefore the lockdown
is lifted. At this point the control procedure is switched on
and the number of infected individuals are regulated so as
to bounce between the threshold limits I(t) = 0.001 · N
and I(t) = 0.002 · N , and are constrained to remain within
them. This is the regulation we would like to achieve, and
it is achievable when we use real-time data that has no
delays, as the SIR model simulation in Fig 13 (Left) shows.
However, there are major delays in all aspects of the virus
transmission and the detection of infected individuals, and
these delays can introduce severe instabilities. The virus itself
has an incubation time of 5-7 days before symptoms appear
but it can be even up to 14 days. There can quite easily be
a week between the time in which the infection symptoms
are noted, a test is performed, results analysed, any person
who tests positive reaches a hospital bed. Thus the reported
confirmed case numbers or the numbers of hospital beds may
give a picture of infection events that occurred 2 weeks in
the past, or more. Yet the key index for policy makers in
many countries is the availability of hospital beds, with the
goal of ensuring their availability at all times. The influential
paper of Flaxman et al. [1], for example, suggests that the
decision to roll out lockdowns should depend on availability
of hospital beds. Thus using hospital bed-data as a guide for
implementing or releasing a lockdown, implies that decisions
are based on the state of the epidemic from several weeks
in the past. In Fig 13 (Right), we show the same epidemic
outbreak as in Fig 13 (Left) except that the lockdown is

switched on or off based on actual data from two weeks in the
past. As a result of the time delay, large secondary waves of
the epidemic are generated creating havoc in the population
with no sign of stability appearing. Thus attempting to control
the outbreak with time-delayed data can easily lead to a large
secondary wave, or a chain of out-of-control waves, which is
exactly what we were trying to avoid.
Finally, we also mention that it is of course true that social
mixing may also be controlled by separating the population
into spatial compartments, and that this may be considered an
alternative to our proposed strategy. While this is true, there are
distinct advantages to the strategy that we are proposing. First,
with our strategy, leakage between compartments is easier
to manage. Epidemiological dynamics under compartmental
population models, with some compartments under lockdown
while others are not, are governed by cross-infection rates
and therefore depend strongly on the particular choice of
population compartmentalisation. Second, and perhaps more
importantly, compliance with the strategy is easier to enforce
in using a temporal strategy, rather than in a spatial one (as
we are now witnessing throughout the world). We believe
that a population-wide simultaneous short periodic lockdown,
with perhaps essential sectors such as hospitals, transportation
sectors, pharmaceutical companies, not locking down at all,
is simpler to implement, with respect to public communication, public acceptance, and enforcement, than a permanent
lockdown rule based on personal characteristics.
Concluding remarks
To conclude, the theoretical and empirical simulation results
in this paper suggest that policies of switching rapidly in

and out-of lockdown, augmented by a slow outer loop, is
potentially of great value in abating the effect of COVID19. While it is beyond the scope of this present paper, initial
results have shown the ideas we have developed also perform
well in stochastic compartmentalised scenarios, and in agent
based models. This latter point is very important, as some
compartments in society simply cannot close (hospitals, transport, key industries). Future work will further develop stratified
switching strategies, and evaluate the effect of switching in
alleviating the need for widespread and targeted COVID-19
testing (sampling) strategies, and will also include cost models
to consider these economic effects more explicitly. This latter
work is ongoing and will be reported in follow on publications.
As a final comment, we note that our proposed strategy is
designed to complement, rather than replace other existing
viral mitigation strategies, such as social distancing or face
coverings.

Using Eq (13) and the three latter estimates, we obtain Inequality (15) by defining

We consider uncertainty in model parameters represented as zero-truncated Normal distributions with means σ1 , ..., σ16 and
10% standard deviation, and estimate β from samples of the basic reproduction number R0 ∼ N (µ = 2.676, σ = 0.572). By
Monte Carlo simulations, 1000 samples were drawn from the joint distribution of the parameters. In order to focus the analysis
on the effect of the open-loop FPSP policy, the initial quarantine period for each simulation trial is set to the minimum time
for which the infected individuals equals the 2.1% of the total population (i.e., the value estimated for the median number of
observed infected individuals after 50 days). The median, 75-percentile and 95-percentile of infected individuals under example
policies are shown in Fig 14. Stabilising open-loop FPSP parameterisations avoiding a second peak of infections with 95%
probability exist for the SIDARTHE model, both for biweekly (X ≤ 4) and monthly (X ≤ 8) switching periods. The outer
loop stabilizes all policies including those with period lengths of 16 weeks (Fig 14, right column). The simulations further
show that growth trends highlighted above persist across the distribution of model parameters explored here: the peak infected
population increases with increasing duty-cycle for fixed period lengths (left to right in each row) and, notably, with increased
period length for fixed duty-cycles (top to bottom in each column).

Fig. 14: Sensitivity analysis of the quantity I +D +A+R+T in the SIDARTHE model on uncertainty in epidemiological
model parameters. The y-axis has a linear scale for better visibility of differences across plots. Simulations in each row have
fixed period length. Simulations in each column have fixed duty-cycle apart from the right-most column, which shows the effect
of the outer loop. Parameters were sampled from zero-truncated Normal distributions with means σ1 , ..., σ16 and 10% standard
deviation. β was estimated from samples of the basic reproduction number R0 ∼ N (µ = 2.676, σ = 0.572) representing the
consensus distribution in [38].
