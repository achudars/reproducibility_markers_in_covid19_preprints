Summary
Since the beginning of March 2020, the cumulative numbers of cases of infection with the
novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Germany have been reported on a daily basis. The reports
originate from national laws, according to which positive test findings must be submitted to
the Federal Health Authorities, the Robert Koch Institute, via the local health authorities.
Since an enormous number of unreported cases can be expected, the question of how
widespread the disease has been in the population cannot be answered based on these
administrative reports. Using mathematical modeling, however, estimates can be made. These
estimates indicate that the small numbers of diagnostic tests carried out at the beginning of the
outbreak overlooked considerable parts of the infection. In order to cover the initial phase of
future waves of the disease, wide-spread and comprehensive tests are recommended.

Introduction
During the COVID outbreak in Germany in spring 2020, the cumulative number of cases of
infected people was reported daily starting on March 4. The numbers of cases were based on
the positive results reported according to the Infection Protection Act
(“Infektionsschutzgesetz”, IfSG) of the diagnostic tests carried out throughout Germany for
the novel coranavirus SARS-CoV-2. The number of tests carried out was based on regional
characteristics, availability of test kits and laboratory capacities. The frequency of the tests
carried out increased during the epidemic [RKI 2020]. Together with the fact that several
people with the associated COVID disease show only asymptomatic or mild courses and
presumably have not been tested at any time, the variable frequency of the tests leads to the
hypothesis that the actual disease process was at least partially underestimated.
Based on the administrative case numbers, in this work we provide a lower bound for the time
course of the numbers of actually infected people. For this, we use the effective reproduction
number (Reff). In contrast to the actual number of cases, an estimate of Reff is possible if the
cases are only reported incompletely [an der Heiden 2020]. Our resulting estimate of the
lower bound of the numbers of infected people allows to further estimate an upper bound for
the proportion of cases that were recorded in the administrative reports according to the IfSG.
This proportion is referred to as the case detection ratio (CDR) [Borgdorf 2004].

Methods
We start from the frequently used epidemiological model that Kermack and McKendrick
described in their seminal work from 1927 [Kermack 1927]. Since the model consists of the
three disease-relevant states 'Susceptible', 'Infectious' and 'Removed', i.e., recovered or dead,
it is often called the SIR model [Vynnycky 2010]. The following ordinary differential
equation applies to the number I of infectious persons at time t
dI
 r  I  Reff  1 ,
dt

(1)

where Reff denotes the effective reproduction number. The effective reproduction number is
the average number of secondary infectious cases that one primary case infects. The quantity
r in Equation (1) describes the rate at which people leave the stage of being infectious. A
mathematical rationale for Equation (1) is given in the supplement to this work. Given the
initial condition I(0) = I0 at the starting time t = 0 of the official reports on March 4, the
number of infectious persons at time t can be derived from Equation (1). It holds:
 t

I (t ) I 0  exp r  Reff ( )  1d  .
 0


(2)

As shown in the appendix to this work, the SIR model for the number Ft of the newly
occurring infectious cases (incident cases) in the period from t to t +  leads to:
Ft  S (t )  S (t   )  Reff (t )  r  I (t )   .

(3)

Since the administrative case numbers were reported on a daily basis, we henceforth assume 
= 1 day.
Equations (1) to (3) apply to all infectious diseases that can appropriately be described using
the SIR disease model [Vynnycky 2004, Chowell 2009]. These equations are independent of
screening tests or any diagnostic procedures. By carrying out tests, the presence of the
pathogens that underlie the disease becomes visible.
In the case of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, new infectious cases are reported daily via
administrative channels. If in a reported case the date of onset of the disease has not been
communicated, these new cases are assigned to a specific day using a statistical method [an
der Heiden 2020]. Slight smoothing using a spline is used to smooth the number of reported
incident cases.
Let the number of newly incident cases assigned to a day t be denoted by Ft(b), we can
consider the proportion of the reported cases in relation to the actual (incidental) new cases Ft
according to Equation (3). This leads to the case- detection ratio (CDR) [Borgdorf 2004]:
CDRt 

Ft (b )
.
Ft

(4)

In the case of a complete detection of all newly occurring infectious cases on one day t, the
CDRt would equal 100%. Since in the early days of the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2

epidemic only a few tests were carried out in Germany, it can be assumed that the CDR was
low in early March.
Based on the reported reproduction number Reff and r = 0.1 per day [an der Heiden 2020], we
use Equations (2) and (3) to calculate a lower bound for the number I0 of infectious cases at
time t = 0 we use that the CDR is at most 100% at any time. This means that the observed new
cases Ft(b) cannot exceed the number of new cases Ft. For all times t we have:
 t

Ft (b )  CDRt  Ft  Ft  Reff (t )  r    I 0  exp r  Reff ( )  1d  .
 0


(5)

The only unknown quantity on the right side of (5) is the number I0 of the persons infected at
the time t = 0. As soon as we have a lower bound for I0 and thus a lower bound for the number
Ft of the actual new cases via (5), we can determine an upper bound for the CDR using
equation (4). As an illustration, we compare our estimate for the time course of the CDR with
the number of positive tests performed.

Results
Figure 1 shows the corrected new cases Ft(b) in the administrative reports of the Robert Koch
Institute for the reporting period from March 4 to April 8 [an der Heiden 2020]. In addition,
the smoothed curve is drawn as a black line.
The blue dashed curve in Figure 2 is a lower bound of the new cases Ft based on the estimate
(5). A lower bound of 7990 people is obtained for I0.
If we now calculate the ratio Ft(b) / Ft for the determination of the upper bound of the CDR, we
obtain the curve as depicted in Figure 3. This shows in particular that in the beginning of the
epidemic in Germany the CDR was quite low with at most 30%.
In Figure 4, the quotient Ft(b) / Ft is compared to the number of positive results (number of
tests performed multiplied by the positive rate) as red curve [RKI 2020]. Qualitatively, there
is a similar course over time, which we see as an indication of our claim that the test behavior
has changed over the reporting period.

Discussion
It is important to run screening and diagnostic tests to track the course of an epidemic
outbreak and to assess possible measures to control the epidemic. In the extreme case that no
tests are carried out, the epidemic goes widely unnoticed.
In this work we use the effective reproductive number Reff estimated over the generation time
to estimate the actual occurrence of infections with the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 in the German
population as a whole. A comparison of the reported cases (Ft(b)) with the expected cases (Ft)
gives an upper limit of the case detection ratio (CDR). As was shown on the basis of the daily
reported case numbers, the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Germany remained
largely undetected until around March 15.
At the start of reporting on March 4, a cumulative number of 262 cases was reported. Our
estimate here shows that there were already around 8,000 infected people in Germany at this
point in time. The phase of inadequate testing also includes the peak of infection around
March 9, at which Reff reached the tentative maximum of 3.3. In order to reliably enable future
surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, we need a close-knit recording with sufficient test capacities.

Supplementary information
For giving the theoretical justification for Equations (1) and (3), we start with the SIR model
[Chowell 2010, Vynnycky 2010], where S, I, R denote the numbers of susceptible, infectious
and recovered people in the population, respectively. If the mortality of the susceptible people
is negligible (for COVID it is), we have following system of differential equations
dS
   IS
dt

(A1)

dI
 IS  rI
dt

(A2)

dR
 rI .
dt

(A3)

Here,  is the rate of making an efficient contact (per time unit) and r is rate at which
infectious people leave the infectious state (due to recovery or death). Let N = S + I + R, then
we have  = R0 r / N, where R0 is the basic reproduction number [Vynnycky 2010]. Insertion
into (A2) yields dI/dt = r I (R0 S/N  1). As Reff = R0 S/N, we have Equation (1).
As Ft = S(t)  S(t + ) can be approximated by  dS/dt (Taylor's Theorem), Equation (A1)
and  = R0 r / N yields Ft    I S =  Reff r I, which is Equation (3).
