Abstract
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmingly demonstrated the need to
accurately evaluate the effects of implementing new or altering existing
nonpharmaceutical interventions. Since these interventions applied at the societal level
cannot be evaluated through traditional experimental means, public health officials and
other decision makers must rely on statistical and mathematical epidemiological models.
Nonpharmaceutical interventions are typically focused on contacts between members of
a population, and yet most epidemiological models rely on homogeneous mixing which
has repeatedly been shown to be an unrealistic representation of contact patterns. An
alternative approach is individual based models (IBMs), but these are often time
intensive and computationally expensive to implement, requiring a high degree of
expertise and computational resources. More often, decision makers need to know the
effects of potential public policy decisions in a very short time window using limited
resources. This paper presents a computation algorithm for an IBM designed to
evaluate nonpharmaceutical interventions. By utilizing recursive relationships, our
method can quickly compute the expected epidemiological outcomes even for large
populations based on any arbitrary contact network. We utilize our methods to evaluate
the effects of various mitigation measures in the District of Columbia, USA, at various
times and to various degrees. R code for our method is provided in the supplementary
material, thereby allowing others to utilize our approach for other regions.

Introduction
In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was
discovered in Wuhan China [1]. The virus causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19), characterized by fever, cough, shortness of breath and other respiratory or
flu-like symptoms. Severe cases can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, multi-organ
dysfunction and death [2–4]. Since its discovery, the virus has rapidly moved across the
globe and on March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to
be a global pandemic. To date, over 27.6 million cases and over 900,000 deaths have
been reported worldwide [5]. Nearly all countries have identified COVID-19 cases, with
158 countries reporting greater than a thousand cases and 50 countries having recorded
over a thousand deaths [5]. As the size of the pandemic continues to grow experts
expect COVID-19 will pose a significant threat for many months and potentially years.
Thus, the burden not just to population health, but also the overall healthcare system,
skilled and long-term care, and the global economy are likely to be substantial.

Given the rapid growth with which COVID-19 has moved across the globe, policy
makers have sought guidance to slow the spread, reduce the severity of the epidemic, or
guide strategies for reopening. Consequently, many infectious disease models have been
developed to forecast the trajectory of the current epidemic and to understand the likely
impact of a range of interventions [6–15]. Models designed to capture certain aspects of
the epidemic (e.g., forecasting mortality) may not be well suited for others (e.g.,
evaluating policy decision making), and so decision makers have increasingly had to
navigate a range of diverse modeling approaches while attempting to find approaches
that can meet the specific nature of a given setting [16]. In short, decision makers need
information on the effects of public policy measures on an epidemic that is both timely
and accurate. From a modeler’s perspective, this translates into a model which is both
computationally efficient and which captures salient features of transmission through a
population.
Many models have been developed to represent the disease transmission process and
evaluate control measures related to COVID-19. Such models typically fall into one of
two major categories: homogeneous mixing compartmental models and
individual/agent-based models (IBMs). Equation-based models are typically less
computationally expensive and can be implemented quicker than IBMs. For
example, [7] implemented an early forecast for COVID-19 in Hubei, China, using a mass
action compartmental model; [17] developed a compartmental model with homogeneous
mixing which was used to capture the undocumented cases of COVID-19; [18] used a
compartmental model with homogeneous mixing which allowed for time-varying
reproduction number; and two web-based forecasting platforms applied an interactive
deterministic compartmental model assuming homogeneous mixing and allow a user to
alter a time-dependent intervention [8, 9]. Some approaches have tried to estimate the
effect of social distancing measures on COVID-19 such as [19] which uses a stochastic
mass action compartmental model and [20] which used an age stratified mass action
model. A limitation of equation-based compartmental models is that they rely on the
assumption of homogeneous mixing, or mass action.
An alternative to equation-based compartmental models are IBMs, which provide a
method for capturing heterogeneous mixing by simulating contacts among individual
agents. A wide range of IBMs have been developed for COVID-19 [21–40]. IBMs have
been developed to evaluate numerous interventions including community lockdowns or
closures [22, 26, 27, 31, 32, 35, 36, 38, 39], contact tracing, isolation and
quarantine [22–24, 26, 27], mask wearing [29, 32, 33, 39, 40], social
distancing [22, 24–26, 29, 35] and travel restrictions [26]. IBMs have also been developed
to simulate multiple contact settings (e.g., homes, schools, workplaces, public
transportation, etc.) [22–24, 27] and have been applied across a range of populations,
cities and countries. [22, 24, 26, 27, 32] However, not all IBMs accurately capture realistic
contact networks, such as [34] which assumes that individuals’ degrees follow a Poisson
distribution. Such a short-tailed degree distribution misses the profound impact that
so-called superspreaders have on the outbreak [41, 42]. [43] states (p.120),
[superspreaders] transmit infection to many other members of the
population, while most infectives do not transmit infections at all or
transmit infections to very few others. This suggests that homogeneous
mixing at the beginning of an epidemic may not be a good approximation.
These IBMs, however, come at a steep computational cost and can often necessitate a
large time commitment as well as a high level of expertise to design and code efficiently.
IBM’s are particularly well-suited to evaluate nonpharmaceutical interventions that
focus on contacts between individuals. To accurately understand the effects of these
types of interventions, we must more accurately model how individuals contact one

another. This has been commented on by others; e.g., [44] wrote “realistic mixing can
be an important factor to consider in order for the models to provide a reliable
assessment of intervention strategies” (p.31). There is a large body of research showing
how in many settings homogeneous mixing is inadequate for accurately modeling disease
dynamics, such as [43–49] (see [46] and [48] for further reference listings on this). As a
recent concrete example, [50] evaluated model assumptions in the West African Ebola
outbreak and stated, “we see that alternative hypotheses for how [Ebola Virus Disease]
spreads, such as homogeneous mixing and nearest neighbor interactions, provide
quantitatively poorer agreement with data” (p.3). While not a focus of this paper, one
important aspect is preferential mixing based on age [51]. While this has been done
successfully for age-stratified homogeneous mixing models (see, e.g., [52]), if a model is
to incorporate age when evaluating interventions on contacts, we believe that it would
be better to incorporate this into a realistic network model through social selection
mechanisms.
One of the advantages of equation-based models over IBMs is the simplicity and
speed with which the former can typically be implemented. [53] The computational
complexity of IBMs, especially when simulating large populations and complex contact
networks, often require extensive programming, algorithmic efficiency, computing power
and parallel processing. [54–56] Conversely, many equation-based models can be quickly
implemented using more simplistic numerical computing environments or even basic
spreadsheet software. [57] Thus, equation-based models may be utilized more quickly
during an outbreak setting of an emerging infectious disease. Indeed, during the
COVID-19 pandemic many of the earliest modelling estimates were produced by
equation-based models [58–61] or branching process models (that focused on early
stages of an outbreak) [36, 62–64]. Some of the earliest examples of IBMs applied to
COVID-19 involved the re-purposing of models designed for previous outbreaks (e.g.,
influenza or smallpox). [22, 26, 27, 63] In the early stages of an outbreak, policy makers
may need to quickly evaluate multiple types of complex interventions under a range of
unknown parameter values, and some policy actions may more well-suited to IBMs. [65]
Thus, there is a need to develop methods that can produce estimates consistent with
IBM-based approaches while offering the computational efficiency typically represented
by most equation-based models.
The contribution of this paper is primarily to present a computationally efficient
estimation method for a network-based IBM which can be used for evaluating
nonpharmaceutical interventions such as implementing or lifting social distancing
measures or implementing universal personal protective equipment (PPE). Our second
contribution is to use this method to provide critical information on the effects of
various nonpharmaceutical mitigation measures in the District of Columbia (D.C.) at
various times and to various degrees.

Methods
Overview
Our proposed method for modeling disease transmission dynamics through a
susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model relies on a contact network
rather than mass action assumptions. It focuses on the individuals in the population,
but rather than simulating disease over an individual-based model and averaging the
results to obtain an estimated epidemic curve, our method directly estimates the
probability that a particular individual is infectious at a particular time. Through the
use of recursive relationships, the expected number of infected individuals can be
efficiently computed at each time point.

The primary benefit of our proposed approach is the ability to obtain the expected
epicurve from an SEIR IBM analytically, thereby saving practitioners from having to
run thousands of simulations for each possible parameter configuration and
counterfactual scenario. Other strengths of the method include the following. First, it
relies on a realistic or observed contact network. This is in contrast to assumptions of
homogeneous mixing, or that the contact degree distribution is not heavy tailed (e.g.,
Poisson). This crucially allows us to capture the effects of superspreaders [41, 42],
burstiness of the epidemic (i.e., the tendency for an epidemic to show alternating
patterns of slow and rapid growth, as opposed to a steady growth curve) [66, 67], and
other salient features of realistic contact graphs. Second, our approach explicitly
captures the way nonpharmaceutical interventions can affect the disease transmission
through quarantining/social distancing or reducing the risk that a susceptible-infective
contact will lead to a new transmission through, e.g., personal protective equipment
(PPE).
Our method is limited in that some disease characteristics are simplified in exchange
for more accurate contact patterns and computational efficiency. Specifically, it assumes
that everyone who becomes infected experiences a constant latent period and is able to
transmit the disease to their set of regular contacts (either directly or through the
environment) for the same amount of time. While these quantities can be estimated
from the data, it does not reflect the varying lengths of time individuals are susceptible
nor the varying lengths of time individuals are infectious before recovering, dying, or
being effectively isolated. In addition, it may be that the population is partitioned such
that subpopulations have varying levels of infectivity and susceptibility; for example,
susceptible individuals of different ages may be more or less easily infected by infectives.
While our approach allows (1) contacts patterns to differ between subpopulations and
(2) transmission rates to vary over time, we have not accounted for individual level or
dyadic level transmission rates.
While our proposed IBM may not be the most realistic model, as IBMs can always
be more nuanced, it offers a significant computational benefit. Our proposed approach
can be used to compute the expected results from a network-based IBM with large
populations using limited computing resources, and our method is easily and quickly
deployed (a small R package for implementing this methodology is provided in the
supplementary material). This computational efficiency allows a user to quickly explore
the effects of public policy changes on social distancing or universal PPE interventions,
thereby providing decision makers a timely method of evaluating, for example, when
and to what degree social distancing measures should be implemented or relaxed.

Approach
We begin by presenting the setup and notation we will use. For a population of size N ,
let the initial probability that an individual is infected be denoted as p0 . For
j = 1, 2, . . . , N , let xtj = 1 if individual j is infective at time t, t = 1, 2, . . . , T , and 0
otherwise. The probability that xtj = 1, E(xtj ), is denoted by x̂tj . The N individuals in
the population are connected through a contact graph which is represented by a N × N
adjacency matrix A such that Aij = 1 if i and j can contact each other and 0 otherwise.
The probability that a susceptible individual j is infected by an infective neighbor on
the contact graph at time t is denoted by pt . If this event occurs, the susceptible enters
a latent period of DE days where they have been exposed but are not yet infectious.
This latent period is immediately
followed by a period of DI days where the individual
P
is infective, and hence t xtj = DI ∀j. Let It denote the set of infectives at time t, and
let Nj denote the neighbors of j on the contact graph. At time t, let Qtj denote the
event that susceptible individual j is self-quarantining, and let this event occur with
probability qtj . Let ι denote the daily probability of a susceptible individual importing

the disease from outside the population of interest. Finally, let Htj denote the event
that j is successfully infected at time t (and hence will enter the latent period for DE
days), where H0j corresponds to the event that j is the outbreak’s initializer/patient
zero. We denote the probability that an event, such as Htj , has occurred by Prob(Htj ),
0
and the probability that it has not occurred by Prob(Htj
), and for conditional
probabilities we use | to separate the unknown event (left) from the events which we
know to have occurred (right).
The goal of the analysis is to estimate the expected number of new infections each
day- or equivalently each day’s expected cumulative number of infections- according to
the individual-based model described above. To achieve this, we first focus on
estimating the probability of being infective for each individual in the population on
each day, i.e., x̂tj .
For the first few days of the outbreak, the only infective(s) will be the outbreak
initializer(s). If the latent period is longer than the infectious period then there will be
one or more days with zero infectives. If the opposite is true (DE < DI ), then following
these first few days there will be a period where the probability an individual is
infective equals the probability that they are either the outbreak initializer or were
infected within the first t − DE days. After this, the probability that an individual is
infective equals the probability that they were not an initializer and were infected
within a moving window such that they have passed the latent period but have not yet
recovered. To put this concretely in mathematical terms, we have the following. For
1 ≤ t ≤ min(DE , DI ),
x̂tj = p0 .

If individual j is still susceptible at time t, they can become infected by either
importing the disease from outside of the study population or by being infected by an
infective neighbor on the contact graph. This latter method requires both that j is not
quarantined at time t and that at least one infective neighbor infects j. Hence by the
law of total expectation we have that

The parameters to be estimated include the length of the disease’s latent period
(DE ), the number of days an individual is infective (DI ), the probabilities that a
contact leads to a transmission event (pt ), and the probabilities that an individual is
quarantined at time t (qt ). The initial probability p0 may also need to be estimated, but
in many cases this will be a known (small) number, such as 1/N for a single initializer.
Given a contact graph, prior to social distancing and any intervention which may affect
transmission probabilities the quantities pt may be related to the more intuitive
reproduction number, or R0 , defined to be the expected number of new infections
generated by a given infective. This can be computed as

R0 = (# days infectious)×E(# contacts per day)×Prob(S-I contact leads to new transmission)

where d¯ is the average degree in the contact graph A, i.e., the average number of

minimizing the sum of squared differences between the observed and the expected
number of daily cases.

COVID-19 in District of Columbia
Case Data
We used publicly available data collected by The COVID Tracking Project [68] for
Washington D.C.. This data source provides the daily number of lab confirmed cases
which we used to train our IBM. We used data from the first case at the beginning of
March until the end of May when protests over the killing of George Floyd led to a large
number of unexpected potential transmission events.
To obtain estimates of the number of infections, we used results from a study
involving a random sample of individuals to test in Indiana [69] which estimated the
infection fatality rate (IFR) to be 0.58%. We then used a 30-day rolling window to
compute the reporting rate for each day; deaths were shifted by 16 days, as this was the
average time between symptom onset and death [70]. That is, for day t, we looked at
the reporting rate RRt
Pt
s=t−29 # reported cases on day s

RRt = P
t+16
s=t−13 # reported deaths on day s /IF R
These daily reporting rates were then used to rescale the number of reported cases to
obtain an estimate of the daily number of infections.

Contact graph
We based our contact graph on a study of inter-personal daily contacts in Hong
Kong. [71] In this study, 1,450 individuals were recruited from 857 households, where a
contact was defined to be a social encounter which included a “face-to-face conversation
or touch (such as handshake, a kiss, games and sports or similar events involving body
touch)” [71]. As was consistent with other studies, they found the distribution of
contacts to be heavy tailed, which has profound effects in the context of infectious
disease as this indicates potential super-spreaders. Overall, individuals had on average
12.5 contacts per day. This matches closely with an ecological momentary assessment
study of individuals in upstate New York which found the average number of daily
contacts to be 12 [72]. We then constructed a network of 705,749 nodes by randomly
assigning each node a number of stubs drawn from a negative binomial distribution with
mean 12.5 and dispersion parameter 1.3. Each stub was randomly connected to another
node’s stub, and in this way we preserved the desired degree distribution.

Mobility data
We estimated individual response to quarantine policy measures and the corresponding
mobility patterns using Google Community Mobility Reports [73]. The authors
complied with the terms and conditions of https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/.
Google Community Mobility Reports use geolocated mobile phone data to assess

various populations’ movement patterns. This was measured by first capturing a
baseline rate of movement and then evaluating deviations from this baseline rate. These
baseline measurements were taken from the period 3 January, 2020 - 6, February, 2020,
and were broken down by day of the week and by category (workplace, retail and
recreation, etc.). We chose to focus on the category of retail and recreation, as this
seemed to best reflect voluntary movement patterns. We used ordinary least squares
(OLS) to find a parameter by which we could multiply the deviations given in the
Google Community Mobility Reports in order to obtain a daily estimate of the
probability an individual would self-quarantine.

Scenarios
On March 11, 2020 the mayor of D.C. issued a State of Emergency declaration [74].
From the mobility data it is clear that this prompted a sudden shift towards
self-isolation (see Figure 1). In addition, a face mask mandate was issued on April
15 [74]. We trained our model using OLS on the daily number of infections, estimating
the effect of the lockdown as well as the effect of the face mask mandate; the latter of
these was estimated as a rescaling of the transmission parameter.
We then computed the expected number of daily infections were the declaration of
emergency to have occurred one week earlier and one week later than March 11; this
was done by shifting the mobility data either backward or forward a week. We also
considered the scenario where there was no declaration of emergency. We then
evaluated the effect of replacing the lockdown via the declaration of emergency with a
face mask mandate for the dates March 4, 11, and 18. We additionally evaluated the
effect of supplementing the lockdown with a face mask mandate, again for the same
three dates. Since the dates under consideration were so early in the course of the
epidemic, we assumed that it would take some time before the same level of
mask-wearing compliance as seen on April 15 would be observed. We therefore allowed
the transmission rate to change smoothly from pre-mandate to post-mandate levels
through a Gaussian kernel such that after ten days the transmission rate was 90%
through the transition towards its final value.
We further estimated the effects of reimplementing social distancing for only a
strategic portion of the population. This was determined by implementing social
distancing for those individuals with the highest number of contacts (e.g., healthcare
professionals rotating between long term care facilities) while maintaining no social

November 4, 2020

distancing measures for the remainder of the population. We evaluated the effects of a
declaration of emergency on March 11 affecting only the top 10% as measured by
number of contacts and for the top 50% both with and without an accompanying face
mask mandate. In both cases, those designated to self-quarantine did so at the rate
observed from the mobility data (see Figure 1), while those not designated did not
quarantine.
Lastly, we estimated the effect of delaying the lockdown induced by the declaration
of emergency by 1, 2, and 3 weeks while implementing a mask mandate. For all
lockdown delays, this mask mandate was implemented on March 11 (the day of the
observed declaration of emergency), and as before we allowed a gradual rollout of the
mask mandate.

Results
By May 28, 2020, there were 453 deaths recorded in D.C. due to COVID-19 infections
and 8,492 lab confirmed cases. Figure 2 shows the observed daily and cumulative case
counts data alongside the estimated expected number of confirmed cases.
We estimated an initial R0 of 1.54, an exposed period of 3 days, an infectious period
of 6 days, and a daily probability of an individual importing COVID-19 from outside of
the population of 8.6 × 10−5 . The estimated effect of the face mask mandate was a
reduction in transmissibility (pt ) of 23%.
Figure 3 shows the main results for projecting under various mitigation measures
through the date of the face mask mandate. Each of the three subfigures corresponds to
a given date of implementing the nonpharmaceutical interventions, March 11, March 4,
and March 18, representing the actual date of intervention, the preceding week, and one
extra week delay respectively. In each figure for comparison is the expected number of
daily infections with no intervention (solid). Also given are curves representing the
effects of a declaration of emergency (i.e., lockdown), a mask mandate, and both.
Figure 4 shows the results for contexts when only a subpopulation is expected to
quarantine. Quarantine rates, i.e., the daily probability that an individual will
quarantine, are constant regardless of who is practicing quarantining. Results are shown
for the contexts where all are quarantining, and where the top 50% and 10% of the
population in terms of number of contacts are practicing quarantining. These strategies
are also shown when augmented by a universal mask mandate applied to the entire
population.
Figure 5 shows the results when the lockdown is delayed by 1, 2, or 3 weeks. As a
frame of reference, the curve which corresponds to the actual policies enacted (lockdown
beginning on March 11 and no mask mandate). Excepting this reference curve, all
projections correspond to a mask mandate enacted on March 11 with a gradual rollout.
Quarantining begins on later dates which are marked by the vertical line segments of
matching line type.

Discussion
In an ongoing outbreak, data streams are being continually updated, and estimates of
the disease trajectory are highly dynamic. Data and estimates quickly become outdated,
and hence it is necessary to be able to provide accurate forecasts and projections of
intervention effects rapidly. In other contexts, researchers do not have access to a
powerful computing cluster that allows one to perform the massive simulations required
for an IBM. Our approach provides an analytically tractable solution to compute the
expected epidemic curve and is thus inherently fast and computationally inexpensive
compared to simulation-based inference.

Our approach is limited in that in order to obtain credible or prediction intervals,
simulation would still be required. However, our work was motivated by the need to
evaluate and compare a high volume of scenarios of implementing or ceasing
nonpharmaceutical interventions, and our approach provides a fast and computationally
inexpensive way to do this compared to simulation-based inference.
While we have focused on static networks, it would be a trivial extension of our work
to account for time-varying networks. Equation (6) can be changed to reflect this by
replacing A with some time-specific adjacency matrix A(t) , and all other formulas still
hold. One important application of this would be to address the fact that some
distancing measures affect age strata differently such as school or workplace closures. By
replacing the static network by a time-varying one, school closures, for example, could
be reflected by having at a certain time t the networks {A(s) }s≥t break contacts between
most school-age children. In addition, a vaccination pharmaceutical intervention applied
at time t could be addressed by breaking all contacts involving vaccinated individuals in
the networks {A(s) }s≥t . As mentioned previously, our proposed approach cannot handle
individual- or dyad-level varying transmission rates, and hence we cannot account for
nonpharmaceutical or pharmaceutical interventions that act differentially in this way.
There are several key takeaways from our analysis of COVID-19 in D.C. First, an
early lockdown augmented with a face mask mandate has a powerful effect on the
expected epidemic trajectory. Adjusting for reporting rate, we estimate that there was a
total of 44,590 infections by April 15. Implementing a mask mandate alongside the
lockdown on March 11, we estimate we would have expected to have seen a total of
20,616 infections. Had these two interventions been implemented a week earlier we
estimate we would have seen a total of 11,703 infections. However, a second takeaway is
that this effect is greatly diminished if delayed. Delaying these two interventions by one
week would have led to a total of 47,564. Hence an early response was critical to
mitigating the extent of COVID-19 spread.
Third, a mask mandate alone would probably not be sufficient. Our results show
that there would have been a dramatic increase in infections had a face mask mandate
been put in place in lieu of a lockdown. This conclusion comes with a strong caveat,
however. Because individuals were wearing masks prior to the mask mandate, it is
almost certain that we are underestimating the effect of a mask mandate. That is, the
effects of universal mask wearing is underestimated due to the fact that this effect was
already partially in place due to voluntary mask wearing, and so the effect of a mask
mandate we have estimated is in fact the effect of mandating masks on those who would
not voluntarily wear one.
Fourth, if careful consideration were to allow the strategic selection of individuals to
quarantine, we could have seen almost the same level of reduction in infections by only
implementing the lockdown for the top 50% of individuals as ordered by number of
contacts. This result could have important economic impacts, in that only half the
population would need to quarantine. We reiterate that this does not mean that half the
population is always quarantined, but rather this half of the population is quarantining
at the same rate as what we observed from the data for the overall population (see
Figure 1). This strategic selection has a limit. Our results demonstrate that only
quarantining the top 10% of individuals would lead to a much worse epidemic trajectory.
However, if this strategic 50% quarantining strategy were paired with a mask mandate,
we would have expected to see only 25,020 infections, just 56% of the expected number
of infections when quarantining all individuals without a mask mandate.
Fifth, by implementing a face mask mandate we can achieve similar or better results
when delaying the lockdown by one to two weeks compared to an earlier lockdown
without the mask mandate. Given the heavy economic cost of the lockdown [75], this
result has potentially strong consequences. Moreover, there is growing evidence of the

clinical and public health related harms that may be attributable to prolonged
lockdowns and societal quarantine; examples include delayed medical care [76, 77],
vaccination [78], cancer screening [79], increased mental health problems [80] and food
insecurity [81, 82]. Thus, there are potentially many other indirect benefits to mask
mandates that we do not account for in our model.
One important point is the sensitivity of our results to two factors. First, we made
all inference based on a single network generated as described above. We checked and
confirmed that there was negligible variation in our results based on using other
networks generated according to the same mechanism. Second, we checked how the
accuracy of our results fared due to the approximation used in (5). To do this, we
compared the mean epicurve using our proposed method shown in Figure 2a to a Monte
Carlo estimate obtained by simulation. We also compared the estimated curves in
Figure 3a to Monte Carlo estimates. There was an apparent problem of scale during the
peak of the epidemic, but the shape and conclusions drawn from the curves were the
same for those from our proposed approach and the Monte Carlo estimates. See the
Supplementary Material for these and other sensitivity/accuracy results.
Another important limitation that is worth noting with any study involving the
effects of public health policy is the indirect link between behavior changes and policy.
It is often impossible to fully disentangle the endogeneity of behavior changes, the size
of the epidemic, and the timing public policy, when the counterfactual cannot be
observed. It is likely that mask wearing, social distancing and self quarantine are also
driven by personal precautions and would increase in absence of public policy mandates.
Indeed, there is evidence that many behavior changes that resulted in social distancing
preceded policy changes [83]. Thus, our results should be interpreted based on the
assumed connection to behavior (e.g., the baseline, no intervention, case may not reflect
actual behavior in absence of any policy).
