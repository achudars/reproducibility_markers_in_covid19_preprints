Abstract
In this paper, we propose a dynamical model to describe the transmission of COVID-19, which is spreading
in China and many other countries. To avoid a larger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried
out a series of strong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine is the most
important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to estimate the effect of population quarantine, we
divide the population into seven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and officially
published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model is given. Numerical simulations show that
the proposed model can describe the transmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the
trend of the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role in controlling the disease
spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The control reproduction number of most provinces in China
are analyzed and discussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is in decline in
China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human transmission continuously. Once the control strategy is
removed, COVID-19 may become a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease is still
necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the virus and the meteorological conditions.
A comprehensive meteorological index is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both
high and low migration groups. As the progress on the new vaccine, we design detail vaccination strategies for
COVID-19 in different control phases and show the effectiveness of efficient vaccination. Once the vaccine comes
into use, the numerical simulation provide a promptly prospective research.

Introduction

Coronavirus is a kind of virus that causes infectious diseases in mammals and birds. Usually, the viruses
cause respiratory infections among people and the first identification is in the 1960s [1]. The main
transmission of coronavirus is like other viruses: through sneezing, coughing, coming into contact with the
infected people, or touching daily-used items [2]. On December 26, 2019, the first detected novel coronary
pneumonia case in China was reported as an unknown etiology pneumonia in Wuhan. Evidences pointing

to the human-to-human transmission in hospitals and families are found in retrospective studies [3–6].
It takes a few days to arouse people’s attention and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(China CDC) isolated the first strain of the causative virus (2019-nCoV) successfully on January 7, 2020.
With Chinese New Year migration, the large epidemics occur in China and spread to many countries
rapidly. The World Health Organization (WHO) declares that the pneumonia outbreak caused by 2019nCoV as a public health emergency of international concern on January 31, 2020 [7]. WHO has announced
the official name of the disease caused by a novel coronavirus as COVID-19 [7] on February 11, 2020, it
is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans [8]. As of February 19, 2020,
there have been 74576 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 2118 deaths in China, there are about 30
countries around the world reported over 1000 diagnosed cases.
Among the seven known human coronavirus, four of them are common pathogens of human influenza.
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and 2019-nCoV will cause fatal respiratory diseases [1]. Although people have
identified and analyzed the coronavirus for a long time, knowledge of the coronavirus is quite limited and
there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. Last major
outbreak in China was SARS which is an acute respiratory infectious disease with high fatality rate caused
by SARS-CoV in 2003. Chinese people managed the outbreak of SARS through multiple control and
prevention measures effectively. Compared with SARS, the incubation period of COVID-19 is significant
and rather long. Different mean incubation period of COVID-19 is reported, 5.2 days [9] in the early
stage, 3.0 days [10] and 4.75 days [11] in recent research. The patient with up to 24 days of incubation
period is reported in [10], even 38 days is also reported in Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture
in Hubei Province. Notice that there is quite a lot of people infected with asymptomatic [6] and the
fatality is much lower than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [10]. Genetic studies of viruses show that the
homology of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV is 85% [12]. But 2019-nCoV binds ACE2 with higher affinity
than SARS-CoV S [13]. By the end of January 29, 2020, the confirmed cases caused by COVID-19 are
surpassed SARS. The uncertain of incubation period, asymptomatic cases and super transmissibility of
the virus bring great difficulties in epidemic control.
Extensive research for COVID-19 with multiple perspectives are reported. Corresponding diagnostic
criteria and medication guide are designed and updated timely. Rapid detection reagent, anti-splash
device for respirator and other special apparatus come into service quickly. Chinese government started
first-level response of emergency health and safety, the mechanism for joint prevention and control is
established in a short time. As the disease evolves, it is not only a medical problem, COVID-19 becomes
a problem concern with many society questions. Collect the massive data related to COVID-19 and
analyze the inherent linkage are quite important for the next step control strategy. Epidemic dynamics
and population ecology are the key methods to study infectious diseases, theoretically.
Dynamical modeling of COVID-19 transmission are performed by many scholars. A modified SEIR
model with eight components is proposed by Tang et al. [14], the control reproduction number under their
estimation is 6.47. The travel related risks of disease spreading is evaluated in [15], which indicates the
potential of domestic and global outbreak [3]. The travel restriction effect are also discussed by means of
the simulation result for Beijing, it shows that with travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals
to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14%, compared with the
scenario of no travel restriction. A Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People network is developed in [16] for simulating
the potential transmission from the infection source (probable be bats) to the human infection and the
analytic form of basic reproduction number for a simplified Reservoir-People network is calculated. Ming
et al. [17] apply a modified SIR model to project the actual number of infected cases and the specific
burdens on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU). The estimation suggests that assuming 50%
diagnosis rate if no public health interventions are implemented, the actual number of infected cases could
be much higher than the reported. Chen et al. [18] propose a novel dynamical system with time delay to
present the incubation period behavior of COVID-19, the estimated parameters show that the prediction
is highly dependent on the population size and public policy carrying on by the local governments.
In this paper, we propose an extended SEIR model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in
China. In order to avoid the situation worsening, Chinese government has pursued the most strictest

3

isolation strategy for all people throughout the country to restrict the population mobility. Traffic control,
limitation of travel, extension of the Chinese New Year vacations, delay to return to work, rigorous
management of communities and even the wartime management ensure the susceptible population stay
at home. At this stage, the main aim of the disease control is called ’the prevention of disease spreading
inside’. The proposed model mainly focuses on the home quarantine strategy. It requires people to stay
at home for at least 14 days, which is aiming at reduce the chance of contact with the infected people
as much as possible. The asymptomatic transmission and isolation treatment policy are also taking into
account in this paper. We use the official data published by China CDC and employ a Least-Squares
procedure to estimate the parameters. We simulate the cases of most provinces in China, calculate the
control reproduction number (R0c ) for each selected provinces. To capture the variation of effective control
reproduction number (Rc (t)), we divide the control process into three periods, calculate the average of
Rc (t) for each stage and compare the results inside and outside Hubei province. The numerical results
show that the intervention and support strategy carried out by the government decreases Rc (t) quickly.
Chinese government provide free medical care for the diagnostic COVID-19 patient. Furthermore, as of
24:00 on February 14, 217 medical teams (military medical teams are not included) including 25633 team
members have arrived Hubei from all over China. It relieved the medical pressures of Hubei Province
greatly. We estimate the disease burden by means of accumulated medical resource needed in 90 days,
the peak value and peak time of the diagnostic population are also given in the numerical simulation
part.
Study shows that SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV share high homology with genes, there should be similarity between them. Back to 2003, there is no vaccine or specific medicine for SARS, however, it
seems disappear overnight. Weather factor is considered as an important reason for the vanishing of
SARS [19, 20]. It has pointed out that high temperature will weaken the activity of SARS-CoV [21].
Spring is coming in China, the meteorological factors, such as temperature and humidity, is changing.
To clarify the relationship between the meteorological condition and the transmission of COVID-19, we
obtain the weather data from China Meteorological Data Service Center (CMDC) and define a comprehensive meteorological index M eI. The outbreak of COVID-19 coincides with Chinese New Year
Migration, based on the migration level, we separate all the selected provinces into two groups. The
correlation analysis shows that for the spread rate are significantly associated with M eI in each group.
The air index plays an important but interesting role, it is a positive factor in the low-migration group,
but negative in the high-migration group. The high relative humidity helps to control the spread of
COVID-19 for both groups.
Some progress on the vaccines for COVID-19 are reported, we change the quarantined compartment
into the vaccinated in the proposed model to describe the effect of vaccination. We simulate three scenarios
to represent the vaccination starting from the three control phases, say, the first 7 days (prophase), the
second 7 days (metaphase) and the following 14 days (anaphase). The results show that the efficient
vaccination accelerates the diagnostic population to the peak and contributes to reduce Rc (t) effectively.
The remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows. Based on the proposed dynamical model,
we analyze the current control strategy in Section 2. We discuss the impact of meteorological factors and
vaccines in Section 3. Finally, we present some concluding remarks in Section 4.

2.1

Analysis for current control strategy
Model formulation

Based on the epidemiological feature of COVID-19 and the isolation strategy carrying out by the government, we extend the classical SEIR model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in China. We use a
short-term model to describe the strictest isolation strategy, the population is assumed relatively fixed.
Consideration must be given to both the actual situations and theoretical analysis, some simplifications
are necessary. This model satisfies the following assumptions,

4

(1) All coefficients involved in the model are positive constants.
(2) It is a short-term model, so the natural birth and death rate are not considered.
(3) If one has been cured well, the immune efficacy will maintain for some time, i.e. second infection is
not considered in the model.
Based on the above assumptions and actual isolation strategy, the spread of COVID-19 in the populations
is shown in Figure 1.

(2.1)

= σρE − γI I − dI I − I I
= A A + I I − dD D − γD D
= γA A + γI I + γD D

The population is divided into seven compartments, where S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t), Q(t), A(t) and D(t)
denote the susceptible, exposed, infectious with symptoms, recovered, home quarantined, asymptomatic
infected and diagnosed individuals at time t, respectively. The exposed class means low-level virus
carriers, which are considered to be no infectiousness. The class Q(t) denotes the class in which the
individual who is in the process of home quarantine, according to their travel limitation and the rigorous
management of communities, we suppose that they won’t contact with the infected population. Specially,
in order to match the reported data better, the class D(t) represents the number of medical confirmed
cases which are in isolation treatment at time t.
In system (2.1), we adopt bilinear incidence rates to describe the infection of disease and parameter β denotes the contact rate. The spread ability between infectious individuals with symptoms and
asymptomatic infectious class is different, parameter θ ∈ (0, 1) is used to describe the difference. We
use parameter p and λ to present the quarantined rate and release rate of quarantined compartment Q,

5

respectively. Transition rate of exposed to infected class is denoted as σ. Once infected, the proportion
of becoming symptomatic is ρ and asymptomatic is 1 − ρ. Diagnostic rate of asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious are A and I . And the mean recovery period of class A, I, D are 1/γA , 1/γI and 1/γD ,
respectively. The parameters dI and dD represent the disease-induced death rate.
Under the isolation control strategy, we employ the next generation matrix approach [22] to calculate

Data-Based Parameter Estimation

Data preparation
On January 23, 2020, China CDC and each provincial CDC started to publish the epidemic data in
their official websites, we collect these data up to February 19 for parameter estimation. The period we
select is 28 days, it is just twice of the least home quarantine period. According to the average incubation
period, we divide the total control period into three phases: prophase (1-7 days), metaphase (8-14 days)
and anaphase (15-28 days). D(t) is an important variable in model (2.1), it can be calculated by the
published data, say, D(t) is equal to the accumulated diagnostic cases subtract the recovered and death
cases. The counting rule of D(t) is subtraction, it can avoid the loss of data immensely. We take D(t) as
the benchmark for fitting problem. Qinghai and Tibet have only few of diagnostic cases and the epidemic
is already under control by the government, so these two provinces are excluded in our research, Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan are also not included because of their different diagnostic criteria and control
strategy.
Parameter Estimation and Prediction Procedure
In order to estimate the value of R0c and Rc (t), we use the daily published data to perform fitting. The
data pre-processing is as above mentioned, the basic time scale is day. Some parameters are assumed
as follows. According to the response of each province, 1/p is estimated as 3 to 5 days, 1/λ is taken as
60 days for most provinces. The mean incubation period (1/σ) is about 7 days [14, 23]. Based on the
percentage of symptomatic infected patients reported in [23], we estimate the proportion of symptomatic
in the infected class in [0.7, 0.99]. Although the testing kits are developed and come into service quickly,
the shortage of capacity delays the diagnosis. Refer to the detail of confirmed cases, the average time of
diagnosis (1/I ) for infectious with symptoms is taken in [3, 9]. The diagnosis of asymptomatic infected is
much harder, we estimate the period (1/A ) as 3 to 15 days. Luckily, the spread ability of asymptomatic
infected is limited, we set parameter θ ∈ [0.005, 0.2]. Back to model (2.1), the mortality rate (mr) of
disease can be written as
dD
.
mr =
dD + γD
By calculation, we set mr as 2.1% for most provinces. The death rate of patient without effective medicine
care will be higher, we describe it as dI = cI ·dD , where cI ∈ [1.1, 1.6]. The relationship in average recover

6

period is assumed as γA = cA · γI and γD = cD · γI , where cA , cD ∈ [1.1, 1.5]. The reason is that the
speed of recovery in asymptomatic infected and patients with medicine care is quicker than those infected
without treatment.
We employ a Least-Squares procedure to estimate parameter β and γI . Suppose we have a proper
estimation for other parameters in (2.1), we need to solve the following optimization problem.
min kD(t; β, γI ) − Dpub k2 ,
β,γI

(2.4)

where Dpub is the data published by CDC. Then the estimation and prediction procedure follows,
(1) Set the initial condition for {S(t0 ), Q(t0 ), E(t0 ), A(t0 ), I(t0 ), R(t0 )} and the proper guess for the
parameters in (2.1), except for β and γI .
(2) Based on the official published data Dpub , solve the optimization problem (2.4) to obtain the
estimated β ∗ and γI∗ .
(3) Based on β ∗ and γI∗ , the initial condition and parameters set in Step (1), solve the dynamical system
(2.1) to obtain {S(t), Q(t), E(t), A(t), I(t), R(t), D(t)}.
Remark 2.1. For initial values, the total population data is based on the report published by the
National Bureau of Statistics [24]. Due to the Chinese New Year, many people are in vacation and they
stay at home originally. We estimate the fraction of original home quarantine as about 30%.
Remark 2.2. Due to the change of diagnostic criteria from nucleic acid detection to clinical diagnosis,
there is a jump for Dpub of Hubei Province on February 12, 2020 (see Figure 2(b)).
Accumulated Medical Resource Estimation
In order to avoid the delay of medical treatment caused by personal economic ability, Chinese government started to carry out free medical care strategy timely. National finance support the treatment
for COVID-19 patients strongly. We introduce an index to evaluate the finance support for the disease
treatment. The diagnostic compartment D(t) represents the population of confirmed infected patients
being treated in hospital at time t, we define the accumulated medical resource (AM R) needed until tf
as the integration of D(t),
Z tf
AM R = k
D(t)dt,
(2.5)
0

where the parameter k represents the average index of medical resource a patient needs daily.
2.3

Numerical simulation

Prediction and Estimation
The first confirmed COVID-19 patient of China is in Wuhan, because of the limited knowledge of
the disease, the control measure in Wuhan is insufficient at the beginning. It results in the outbreak
of COVID-19 in Hubei Province. Due to the different circumstance inside and outside Hubei Province,
the estimation and prediction are investigated for the two cases. Notice that, the spread of COVID-19
is very strong, it may cause twice outbreak without effective control. Zhong declares that, the disease
may be controlled well by the end of April [25] under our powerful control strategy, we take parameter
1/λ as 90 days. Based on the procedure in Section 2.2, the corresponding parameter β and γI are given.
The results of inside and outside Hubei province are presented in Figure 2, the blue solid line shows the
fit based on current circumstances and the trends until the end of April are shown. Asterisks represent
the Dpub . All the other parameters, initial values and the corresponding R0c for inside and outside of
Hubei Province can be seen in Tabel 1. We find that the R0c outside Hubei is much higher than it in
inside Hubei. This is mainly caused by the huge total size of Chinese population, it represent the initial
situation in a way. To evaluate the strictest isolation strategy, we calculate the average Rc (t) for three
stages and show them in Table 2. We can clearly see that the values of the average Rc (t) decrease quickly
under current control strategy. It almost down to 1 in metaphase outside Hubei Province and below 1

7

now. The situation in Hubei Province is more complex, though the average Rc (t) decreases sharply, it
is still greater than 1 in anaphase. The disease isn’t under control completely, it still has a high risk
of sustainable spread. Specific medicine and effective vaccine are absent till now, the strictest isolation
strategy makes great contribution to the prevention of the disease spread, it needs to persist in.

To make a better illustration of quarantine strategy, we test different home quarantine period (1/λ) in
Figure 2. The corresponding peak value, peak time of D(t) and the accumulated medical resource needed
in 90 days by AM R which defined in (2.5) are listed in Table 3. In Figure 2, the colorful dashed lines
show that if the quarantine period isn’t long enough, the isolation strategy can not work well. There
needs a longer quarantine period in Hubei Province than outside. The longer quarantine period, the
earlier peak time of D(t) comes. Unlike normal infectious disease, the ward for COVID-19 is particular.
To avoid nosocomial infection, it requires maximal barrier precautions in the hospital and there are quite
a few critically ill patient in ICU. Our medical system is facing the huge challenges caused by patients
shoot up rapidly, especially the peak value of D(t). The study of the maximum capacity to deal with the
emergency is necessary for disease control. In the simulation, the peak time of D(t) in outside Hubei is
on February 12, 2020 and inside Hubei is February 24, 2020, which is in line with the actual data (the last
line in Table 3). By adjust the parameter λ, we find that, if we fix the quarantine period as 30 days, both
the peak value and AM R are more than triple as now inside Hubei. Particularly, the peak time won’t
reach in three months in Hubei. The situation outside Hubei is not much better than that in Hubei. The
peak time delays a week, though the peak value isn’t increase much, the AM R almost doubled. More
details of shorter quarantine period can be seen in Table 3. Notice that, in shorter quarantine period
(5, 10 and 20 days), Tpeak seems proportional to 1/λ. It is mainly caused by a large amount of infected
people, that is, the disease almost infected every susceptible person. The medical burden in shorter
quarantine period situation is horrible.

Optimal simulation and prediction of the transmission trend

Above study gives an intuitionistic understanding of COVID-19 in China. According to the different
characters in each province, we study the transmission and control strategy of COVID-19 more intensively.
The simulation for other provinces are shown in Figure 3 with blue solid lines. Colorful dashed lines
represent the trends of D(t) under different quarantine period. All the parameters are shown in Appendix
Table 8 and Table 9. The peak value, peak time of D(t) for each province under different λ can be found
in Appendix Table 7. Our model fit the published data accurately for most of the provinces. We estimate
the R0c for each province and plot the distribution heat map in Figure 4, the initial situation for each
province is serious. If the control strategy is insufficient, the disease will out of control in each province.
Back to the strictest isolation strategy, up to February 19, 2020, the disease is in the decline phase for
most provinces, it is effective for controlling the transmission of COVID-19. Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang
and Heilongjiang should pay more attention, they are in the key period of the disease control. The home
quarantine period in most province can be much shorter than Hubei and the disease can also be controlled
well. From Figure 3, we find that, the trends of D(t) between 30 days and 60 days quarantine period are
roughly the same, such as GanSu, Yunnan, Tianjin and so on. Considering the need of daily production,
the workers of these provinces can return to work actively and orderly.

R0c distribution heat map

The medical resources in each province are distributed unevenly. After the disease outbreak, the
government deployed medical resources to rescue Hubei Province. We estimate the AM R needed for
each provinces by integrating D(t) from 0 (Jan 23) to 90 (Apr 22) days under different quarantine period
(5 − 60 days). The detail parameter values and corresponding AM R in 90 days are shown in Table 7. We
collect the number of 3A hospital in each province, which can reflect the level of medical resources. In
Table 4, we show the 3A hospital (N3 ) number in each province, the medical burden (M B) is measured
by
AM R
M B3 =
.
N3
The value of AM R is taken as the optimal simulation results, i.e., λ = 1/60. The median of M B3 among
29 provinces is 461, then for which province the M B3 Index is more than 461, it should be paid more
attention. However, after the disease outbreak, The government established many designated hospitals
and fever clinics to relieve the stress of medical resources. Denote Nd as the number of designated
hospital, we set a weight between the 3A hospital and designated hospital. The weighted medical burden
is described as
AM R
M BW =
.
3 ∗ N3 + (Nd − N3 )
Comparing the value of M B3 with M BW in each province, we can clearly see that, thanks to the adjoint
of designated hospital, it has decreased the medical burden sharply. It is benefit for early diagnosis, early
isolation and better treatment. But the disease burden in Hubei is still huge, it is almost 60 times greater
than other province. On one hand, we have taken full advantage of current medical resources; on the other
hand, the additional medical workers and materials from other province are supported to Hubei Province
spare no effort. Sufficient and effective medical support is the basic foundation to control COVID-19.

Further trends for the control of COVID-19

In previous section, the transmission of COVID-19 inside and outside Hubei is discussed. Simulations for
most provinces can conduce to understand the effect of control strategy in China. And the corresponding
analysis for medical resources are given. Isolation strategy plays an important role in the prevention of
disease spreading. But the strictest isolation strategy brings great inconvenient to people’s daily life.

12

Now the disease spread is in decline, more and more people will return to their normal life paths. In
this section, we will explore further control strategy from different perspectives for the following control
phase.

3.1

The impact of Meteorological Index (M eI)

Seventeen years ago, SARS outbroke in China, it spread quickly and disappeared suddenly. There is
no specific medicine and vaccine, the medical level and control strategy are not as complete as today.
Meteorological factor is regarded as a critical role for the vanishing of SARS [19, 20]. Due to the high
genetic homology of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, we want to clarify the meteorological influence in the
spreading of COVID-19. We collect the official published the average meteorological data during the
simulation period, including air index (AI), temperature (T E), precipitation (P R), relative humidity
(RH) and wind power (W P ) from China Meteorological Data Service Center (CMDC) website [26] for
correlation analysis.

(a) Group I. (Left, R0c , r = 0.69, p = 0.0015; Right, β, r = 0.70, p = 0.0012.)

(b) Group II. (Left, R0c , r = 0.84, p = 0.0021; Right, β, r = 0.63, p = 0.049.)
Figure 5

Correlation analysis of R0c , β and M eI.

The outbreak of COVID-19 coincided with Chinese New Year, the population migration is busy at
that time. Wuhan is the towngate of nine provinces, a large number of people moved out or passed by
Wuhan. Population migration is a key factor in the spread process and this factor cannot be ignored in
the analysis. We define an index M iI for each provinces to reflect the population migrate from Hubei
Province, the geographical distance from Wuhan is also considered.
PE
,
DIS 2
where P E is the percentage of population moving in from Hubei, DIS is the distance between the capital
of destination province and Wuhan, C = 1010 is an adjustment constant. The parameter P E and DIS
are from Baidu Migration [27] and Baidu Map [28].
Based on the descending order of M iI for provinces outside Hubei (see Table 5 for details), we separate
them into two groups to represent different migration levels. We set critical value as M iIy = 100. If the
value of M iI is greater than M iIy , it is in the high level group called Group I, others provinces are in low
level group called Group II. From Table 5, the high M iI areas are almost the province surround Hubei
Province.
M iI = C

Based on above grouping criteria, we use the following formula and linear regression procedure to
calculate a comprehensive meteorological index M eI and apply the correlation analysis to R0c , β and
M eI for each group.
M eI = c1 ln (AI) + c2 T E + c3 P R2 + c4 RH + c5 W P + c6 .

(3.1)

The coefficients and intercepts are listed in Table 6. For each group, we calculate M eIR0c and M eIβ and
perform the correlation analysis with R0c and β, respectively. The results are presented in Figure 5, it
shows that R0c and β are significantly associated with M eI.
The coefficients in Table 6 remind us that the effort of meteorology factors on the disease spread is
quite different between the two groups. For example, air index is the most important meteorology factor

in our study, in high M iI group, ln(AI) is inversely proportional to M eIR0c , however, in low M iI group,
the result is inverse. The reason is that, the fraction of imported cases is high in high M iI group, if the
value of AI is small, it represents good air condition, the social activities will increase. In this case, the
probability of contact with infected people is increased. In low M iI group, the bad air condition will
aggravate the spread. The impact of wind power in both group has similar pattern. Bad air condition
and strong wind suggests that, people should pay more attention to the personal protection. In high M iI
group, higher temperature will cause undesirable impact on the control of disease. However, in low M iI
group, the result shows that higher temperature will reduce the spread. Precipitation shows low influence
on COVID-19 spread. Notice that, the results in both groups show that higher relative humidity is the
protection factor for the disease control.
3.2

Further control with new vaccine

On February 22, 2020, Zhejiang Government reported some progress on the vaccine of 2019-nCoV. It is
said that the first vaccine has produced antibodies and the process is in the animal experiment [29]. The
director-general of WHO said that there are more than 20 COVID-19 vaccines candidates are currently
in development phase and some new treatment are in clinical trials, the results will be expected within
a few weeks [30]. The progress of the development of vaccines is much quicker than expected. If the new
vaccine of COVID-19 comes into service, it will be great benefit for the disease control. Considering the
strictest isolation strategy, from the mathematical point of view, the process of the strategy is just like
a short-time vaccine for susceptible population. The effect of stay away from the source of infection is
equal to contact with infected people but doesn’t get infected. After a little modification on model (2.1),
it can describe the impact of the vaccine, by changing the quarantine compartment Q into the vaccine
compartment V and setting parameter p as the vaccination rate, 1/λ as the mean protection period of
the new vaccine.
Though the vaccine hasn’t come into service, the theoretical analysis is necessary to make better
control. In this section, we show the effect of different starting time we begin to use vaccine inside and
outside Hubei Province. Considering the three control phases we defined, we take the starting day on
January 28 (prophase), February 2 (metaphase) and February 12 (anaphase). We assume the average
vaccination period is five year, it means λ = 1/1825. We test different parameter p to present the impact
of vaccination efficiency, the corresponding numerical results are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. In the
area of outside Hubei Province, we take the parameter p as 1/3 and 1/7 to compare with current control
strategy (p = 1/3). We find that the application of vaccine accelerates the epidemic process, bring the
peak forward and reduce total amount of diagnostic population. The trends of Rc (t) with vaccine are
much lower than that in current strategy. In the simulation inside Hubei, we take p as 1/7 and 1/14,
which is smaller than optimal simulation (p = 1/6.2). Totally speaking, the effect will be better as the
parameter p increases. The vaccination strategy does an excellent job of reducing Rc (t) and effective
action of taking the vaccine immunity is very important to prevent the growth of diagnostic population.

Both inside and outside Hubei, the control of disease in prophase should be paid more attention. If the
parameter p is smaller than that in isolation strategy, the peak value of D(t) will be greater than current
situation. It means that, in the prophase of control, it is suitable for taking both vaccination and isolation
strategy into account. Compared with isolation strategy ,vaccination strategy is more convenience for
our daily life and the effect persist long.

Conclusion

The strictest isolation strategy in China has achieved great success in current control stage. Although
the control reproduction number R0c is high, the effective control reproduction number Rc (t) decreases
sharply under intervention. Rc (t) of outside Hubei down to the critical value on February 2, 2020, and
in our simulation the value will maintain about 0.6 (see Figure 6b). In Hubei Province, Rc (t) reaches 1
on February 13, 2020, we can see that it is a continued momentum of decline (see Figure 7b). To have a
better understanding of the isolation strategy, we simulate for each selected provinces, the goodness of fit
shows that the proposed model is suitable to describe the situation of control in China. We find that if
the isolation period isn’t long enough, the strategy won’t work. In Hubei Province, the quarantine period
is simulated as 90 days, our result coincide with Zhong’s study [25]. That is, the control period we suggest
in Hubei is from January to the end of April. In the area outside Hubei, the trends of COVID-19 in most
provinces between 30 days and 60 days isolation period are similar. Under careful personal protection,
the people can return to their work actively and orderly in these provinces.
After the outbreak of COVID-19, China government pushed a series of policies to ensure the medical
care for patients, such as early diagnosis, early isolation, free treatment and etc. We discuss the peak
value and peak time of D(t) in many cases. An index called AM R is well defined to measure the needs
of medical resources. Sufficient medical resources is the basic of the disease control. So it is necessary to
assign medical resources to deal with the shocks caused by booming demand of patients. To study the
detail situation of each province, AM R and original medical power are both considered. We find that,
the set up of designated hospital decreases the medical burden sharply. It has released the pressure of
diagnosis and isolation in each provinces. But the situation of Hubei is crisis, the disease burden is still
huge. Medical workers and materials are transferred to Hubei from other provinces to ensure the control
of COVID-19.
There are many similarities between SARS and COVID-19, following this characteristic, we explore
the relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and meteorological factors, which is considered as a
key factor for the disappear of SARS. The impact of meteorological factors is different in high and low
migration groups (see Table 6). Results show that, air index is the most important meteorology factor.
It is strongly suggests that for low M iI group, if the air condition is bad with strong wind, please pay
more attention to the personal protection. High relative humidity is a positive factor for the COVID-19
control.
In the last part, we do some preparatory work for the coming new vaccine. The situations after the
vaccine comes into use are shown. We tested the different starting time in each control phase inside and
outside Hubei. Vaccination strategy is more convenient for daily control. But the development cycle of
new vaccine is relatively long, the isolation strategy is still necessary in early control. The analysis helps
to design the final vaccination strategy once the new vaccine comes out. All of our study matches the
actual control strategy in China and the results are discussed adequately. It could be a guideline for the
control of COVID-19 in other countries.
