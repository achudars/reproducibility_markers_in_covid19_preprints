Abstract

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world, generating a high
number of total deaths. The contemporary environmental and sustainability debate generates new or relatively
unexplored problems. One of the current questions is: how high polluting industrialization and a less cleaner
production affect the diffusion of COVID-19 infection? This study endeavors to explain the relation between air
pollution and particulate compounds emissions, wind resources and energy, and the diffusion of COVID-19
infection to provide insights of sustainable policy to prevent future epidemics. The statistical analysis here focuses
on case study of Italy, one of the countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Results
reveal two main findings: 1) cities in regions with high wind speed and a high wind energy production in MW have
a lower number of infected individuals of COVID-19 infection and total deaths; 2) cities located in hinterland zones
(mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with high polluting industrialization, low wind speed and less
cleaner production have a greater number of infected individuals and total deaths. Hence, cities with pollution
industrialization and low renewable energy have also to consider low wind speed and other climatological factors
that can increase stagnation of the air in the atmosphere with potential problems for public health in the presence of
viral agents. Results here suggest that current pandemic of Coronavirus disease and future epidemics similar to
COVID-19 infection cannot be solved only with research and practice of medicine, immunology and microbiology
but also with a proactive strategy directed to interventions for a sustainable development. Overall, then, this study
has to conclude that a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection must also be based on
sustainability science to support a higher level of renewable energy and cleaner production to reduce polluting
industrialization and, as result, the factors determining the spread of coronavirus disease and other infections in
society.

INTRODUCTION
The contemporary environmental and sustainability debate has new or relatively unexplored topics that continually
emerge in science. This study provides an investigation for the exploration of causes, consequences and sustainable
policy responses linked to diffusion of Coronavirus disease 2019 in a context of environmental and sustainability
science.
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) produces minor symptoms in most people, but is also the cause of severe
respiratory disorders and death of many individuals worldwide (Ogen, 2020; Dantas et al., 2020). The Coronavirus
infection, started in China in 2019, is an on-going global health problem that is generating a socioeconomic crisis
and negative world economic outlook projections (Saadat et al., 2020). Manifold studies suggest a possible relation
between air pollution and particulate compounds emissions and diffusion of COVID-19 infection (Fattorini and
Regoli, 2020; Frontera et al., 2020). Scholars also state that high level of air pollution can increase viral infectivity and
lethality of COVID-19 infection (Contini and Costabile, 2020). Conticini et al. (2020) argue that population living in
regions with high levels of particulate compounds emissions has also a high probability to develop respiratory
disorders because of infective agents. In fact, the highest level of COVID-19 infection is in the USA, Spain, Italy,
UK, Russia, China, Brazil, France, etc. that are countries having in some regions a very high level of air pollution
(Coccia, 2020; Frontera et al, 2020). Studies confirm correlations between exposure to air pollution, diffusion and
virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 within regions with population having a high incidence of respiratory disorders, such
as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Lung Cancer (Fattorini and Regoli, 2020; Coccia, 2014, 2015).
Lewtas (2007) shows that exposures to combustion emissions and ambient fine particulate air pollution are associated
with genetic damages. Long-term epidemiologic studies report an increased risk of all causes of mortality,
cardiopulmonary mortality, and lung cancer mortality associated with increasing exposures to air pollution (cf.,
Coccia and Wang, 2015). Ogen (2020, p.4) finds that high NO2 concentrations associated with downwards airflows
cause of NO2 buildup close to the surface. This geographical aspect of regions, associated with specific atmospheric

conditions of low wind, prevents the dispersion of air pollutants, which are one of the factors of a high incidence of
respiratory disorders and inflammation in population of some European regions, such as Norther Italy. In short, the
exposure of air pollution, associated with Coronavirus infection, can be a driver of high rate of mortality in Italy
(14.06%), Spain (11.90%), UK (14.37%), Belgium (16.40%), France (15.32%), etc. (cf., Center for System Science
and Engineering at Johns Hopkins, 2020). The study by van Doremalen et al. (2020) revels that in China viral particles
of SARS-CoV-2 may be suspended in the air for various minutes and this result can explain the high total number
of infected people and deaths of COVID-19 infection in the USA, Spain, Russia, France, Italy, Brazil, Turkey, Iran,
etc. (cf., Center for System Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins, 2020). In general, these studies suggest the
hypothesis that the atmosphere having a high level of air pollutant, associated with certain climatological factors,
may support a longer permanence of viral particles in the air, fostering a diffusion of COVID-19 infection based on
mechanisms of air pollution-to-human transmission in addition to human-to-human transmission (Frontera et a.,
2020). In order to extend the investigation of these critical aspects in the development of COVID-19 outbreaks
worldwide, in the presence of polluting industrialization, the goal of this study is to analyze the relation between
infected people, air pollution, wind speed and inter-related renewable wind energy production that can explain some
critical relationships determining the diffusion of COVID-19 and negative effect in environment and public health.
This study has the potential to support long-run sustainable policy directed to foster a cleaner production for
reducing and/or preventing the diffusion of future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection.
METHODS
1.1

Data sources and research setting

This study focuses on fifty-five (N=55) cities that are provincial capitals in Italy, one of the countries with the highest
number of deaths of COVID-19 infection: more than 31,360 units at 15 May, 2020 (cf., Lab24, 2020).
Epidemiological data of COVID-19 infection are from Ministero della Salute (2020); data of polluting
industrialization, air pollution and particulate compounds emissions are from Regional Agencies for Environmental

Protection in Italy (cf., Legambiente, 2019); climatological information are based on meteorological stations in Italian
provinces (il Meteo, 2020); data of the density of population are from the Italian National Institute of Statistics
(ISTAT, 2020) and finally, data concerning the production of wind energy per Italian regions are from Italian
Transmission Operator called Terna (2020).

Primary data analysis and statistics

1.3

Descriptive statistics is performed categorizing Italian provincial capitals in groups, considering:


Renewable wind energy production

- cities with high wind energy production (seven regions in Italy have 94% of national production of wing energy)
- cities with low wind energy production (regions that have 6% of national production of wing energy)


Polluting industrialization with and particulate compounds emissions

-

Cities with high polluting industrialization (> 100 days per year exceeding the limits set for PM10 or for ozone)

-

Cities with low polluting industrialization ( 100 days per year exceeding the limits set for PM10 or for ozone)

Correlation and regression analyses verifies relationships between variables understudy. Regression analysis considers
the number of infected people across Italian provincial capitals (variable y) as a linear function of the explanatory

variable of total days exceeding the limits set for PM10 ( variable x).
The specification of linear relationship is a log-log model:
log yt =  +  log xt-1 + u

[1]

 is a constant; = coefficient of regression; u = error term
An alternative model [1] applies as explanatory variable the density of population per km2 considering groups of cities
with high or low level of polluting industrialization and particulate compounds emissions.
The estimation of equation [1] is also performed using a categorization of cities according to level of polluting
industrialization and their location in regions with high and low intensity of wind energy production. Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS) method is applied for estimating the unknown parameters of linear models [1]. Statistical analyses are
performed with the Statistics Software SPSS version 24.

Table 1 shows that seven regions in Italy (Molise, Puglia, Calabria, Basilicata, Campania, Sicilia and Sardegna) have
the 94% of total wind energy production. These regions have at least over 1 GW of power, with the leadership of
Puglia region (South-East Italy) having 2.5 GW. Italy had in January 2020 about 5,645 wind farms with almost 7,000
wind turbines of various power sizes. In particular, above 10 MW of power there are 313 plants for a total power of
just over 9 GW (i.e., 9.07 GW). The most relevant power class ranges from 20 to 200 kW, with 3,956 systems having
a total power of approximately 234 MW. As just mentioned, Puglia has the largest share of wind power installed in
Italy: 24.8% of the total with 92 plants above 10 MW of power. Results of Italian province capitals, categorized in

two groups belonging to regions with high or low wind energy production, suggest that cities in regions with a high
production of wind energy (94% of total) have a very low number of infected individuals with COVID-19 infection
(in March and April 2020), whereas cities located in regions with a low intensity of wind energy production (6% of
total) have a very high number of infected individuals (Table 2).

Table 2 also shows that cities in regions with low production of wind energy (6% of total) have a higher level of
polluting industrialization than cities with a high production of wind energy (about 70 polluted days vs. 48 polluted
days exceeding PM10 or ozone per year). This preliminary result suggests that regions with a high intensity of windbased renewable energy and low polluting industrialization have also a low diffusion of COVID-19 infection in
society. In order to confirm this result, table 3 considers polluting industrialization of cities: especially, cities with
high polluting industrialization and particulate compounds emissions (>100 days exceeding limits set for PM 10 or
ozone per year) and low production of wind energy, they have a very high level of infected individuals in March and
April 2020, in an environment with high average density of population and low average intensity of wind speed.

Table 5 suggests that polluting industrialization, in areas with low production of wind energy, explains the number
of infected individuals of COVID-19. In particular,
o cities in regions with 94% of wind energy production have not significant results because of low number of
cases in sample
o instead, in cities of regions with 6% of wind energy production, an increase of 1% of polluting industrialization,
measured with days exceeding limits set for PM10, it increases the expected number of infected by about
0.92% (P<.001).
Figure 1 shows a visual representation of regression lines: cities having a higher production of renewable energy tend to have a low number
of total infected individuals driven by polluting industrialization.

Table 6 reveal that in cities with low polluting industrialization and low particulate compounds emissions, an increase of 1% of
the density of population, it increases the expected number of infected individuals by about 0.25% (P=.042); whereas,
in cities with high polluting industrialization, an increase of 1% of the density of population, it increases the expected
number of infected individuals by about 85% (P<.001). Figure 2 shows regression lines on 7th April 2020, in the
middle phase of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy: regions with a polluting industrialization generating an atmosphere
rich of air pollutants that associated with a climate factor of low wind speed support a stronger of diffusion of
COVID-19 infection.

In addition, if we consider regions with high/low air pollution and particulate compounds emissions, using arithmetic
mean of days exceeding limits set for PM10 or ozone of cities, the percentage of infected individuals and total deaths,
weighted with population of these regions, reveals that about 74.50% of infected individuals and about 81% of total
death in Italy because of COVID-19 infection are in regions with high air pollution and polluting industrialization
and with low production of the renewable energy based on wind resource.

DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS
This new study finds that geo-environmental factors may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 in northern
Italian cities, leading to a higher number of infected individuals and deaths. This study analyzed data on COVID-19
cases alongside environmental and wind energy data. It found that cities with little wind and frequently high levels
of air pollution — exceeding safe levels of ozone or particulate matter — had higher numbers of COVID-19 related
infected individuals and deaths. These findings suggest that the current pandemic of Coronavirus disease and future
epidemics similar to COVID-19 cannot be solved only with research and practice in medicine, immunology and
microbiology but also with the development of industrial instruments directed to a sustainable and cleaner production
(Coccia, 2019). These findings here provide valuable insight into geo-environmental and industrial factors that may
accelerate the diffusion of COVID-19 and similar viral agents. The main results of the study, based on case study of
COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, are:
o

The diffusion of COVID-19 in Italy has a high association with high polluting industrialization in cities

o

Cities having a high production of wind energy, associated with low polluting industrialization, have a low
diffusion of COVID-19 infection and a lower number of total deaths.

Considering the results just mentioned, the question is:
what is the link between diffusion of COVID-19 infection, polluting industrialization and renewable wind energy in specific regions?
Results suggest that, among Italian provincial capitals, the number of infected people is higher in cities with polluting
industrialization, cities located in hinterland zones (i.e. away from the coast), cities having a low average intensity of
wind speed and cities with a lower temperature. In hinterland cities (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations,
such as Bergamo, Brescia, Lodi, close to Milan in Lombardy region of North West Italy etc.) with a high polluting
industrialization, coupled with low wind speed and wind energy production, the average number of infected people
in April 2020 more than doubled that of more windy cities with renewable energy production. Therefore, cities in

regions with a high production of wind energy in Italy, they also have a low polluting industrialization, low air
pollution and particulate compounds emissions., in an environment with a high intensity of wind speed that sustains
clean days from air pollution, particulate compounds emissions that current studies suggest the higher diffusion of
Coronavirus infection (Fattorini and Regoli, 2020). As a matter of fact, cities with high polluting industrialization,
mainly in Northern Italy (also having a low wind speed and as a consequence low wind energy production), have a
stagnation of air pollution in the atmosphere that can support diffusion of COVID-19 infection (Contini and
Costabile, 2020; Conticini et al., 2020). The implications for a sustainable policy are clear: COVID-19 outbreak has low
diffusion in regions with low polluting industrialization and high production of renewable (wind) energy. Northern Italian region
covered by the study, as a consequence, in future should reduce pollution industrialization and particulate
compounds emissions, so that the accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 viral infectivity are not triggered.
In order to reinforce these conclusions with a perspective of sustainable policies, Xu et al. (2020) found out the effect
of moisture on explosive growth in fine particulate matter (PM), and propose a new approach for the simulation of
fine PM growth and dissipation in ambient air. In particular, winds significantly aid the dissipation of fine PM, and
high concentrations of fine PM only persisted for a very short time and dissipated after several hours. The role of
climatological factors, such as wind speed and direction, temperature, and humidity are critical for urban ventilation
and the pollutant concentration in the streets of cities (Yuan et al. 2019). Considering the benefit of wind as resource
that can reduce air pollution and as a consequence viral infectivity with main public health benefits, Gu et al. (2020)
argue that a strategy to enhance air quality in cities is improving urban ventilation: the ability of an urban area to
dilute pollutants and heat by improving the exchange of air between areas within and above the urban canopy. Of
course, urban ventilation is a function of a manifold urban geometry characteristics, e.g., frontal and plan area density,
and the aspect ratio of urban morphology. Studies show that variations of building height have beneficial effects in
terms of breathability levels, whereas larger aspect ratios of urban canyons can lead to high levels of pollutant
concentrations inside the streets of cities. Hence, cities located in hinterland zones of the Northern Italian region

with low wind speed have an urban climatology and aspects of urban and regional topography that sustain the
stagnation of air pollution that can support the spread of viral infectivity in fall and winter season. Hence, these
regions have to reduce the level of particulate compounds emissions applying long-run sustainable polices directed
to reduce polluting industrialization and support the production of renewable energy (Wang and Zhu, 2020). In fact,
health and economic benefits associated with national and local reduction of air pollution are now rarely contested.
Cui et al. (2020), based on a study in China, show that where reductions in ambient air pollution and particulate
compounds emissions have avoided more than 2,300 premature deaths and more than 15,80 related morbidity cases
in 2017, with a total of about US$ 318 million in economic benefits. In addition, these scholars argue that reduction
of PM2.5 concentrations to 15 μg/m3 would result in reductions of 70% in total PM2.5-related non-accidental mortality
and 95% in total PM2.5-related morbidity, with economic benefits of more than US$ 1,289.5 million. In short,
sustainable policies that reduce air pollution and particulate compounds emissions generate significant
environmental, public health, social and economic benefits. This study suggests that in order to prevent epidemics
similar to COVID-19 and other infections, nations have to apply a sustainable policy directed to reduce air pollution
that affects public health and amplifies the negative effects of airborne viral diseases. In addition, the policy for a
sustainable development has to consider the urban climatology with the study of climatic properties of urban areas
(Gu et al., 2020) and support renewable energy, such as wind resource, that create the environmental conditions for
the reduction of air pollution on trans-regional level (Wang and Zhu, 2020). Moreover, high surveillance and proper
biosafety procedures in public and private institutes of virology that study viruses and new viruses to avoid that
may be accidentally spread in surrounding environments with damages for population and vegetation. In this
context, international collaboration among scientists is basic to address these risks, support decisions of
policymakers to prevent future pandemic creating potential huge socioeconomic issues worldwide (cf., Coccia

and Wang, 2016; Coccia, 2020a)1. In fact, following the COVID-19 outbreak, The Economist Intelligence Unit
(EIU) points out that the global economy may contract of about by 2.2% and Italy by -7% of real GDP growth
% in 2020 (EIU, 2020). Italy and other advanced countries should introduce organizational, product and process
innovations to cope with future viral threats, such as the expansion of hospital capacity and testing capabilities,
to reduce diagnostic and health system delays also using artificial intelligence, and as a consequence new ICT
technologies for alleviating and/or eliminating effective interactions between infectious and susceptible
individuals, and finally of course to develop effective vaccines and antivirals that can counteract future global
public health threat in the presence of new epidemics similar to COVID-19 (Chen et al, 2020; Wilder-Smith et
al 2020; Riou and Althaus, 2020; Yao et al., 2020; cf., Coccia, 2005, 2009, 2015a, 2017b, 2018, 2019a, 2020b;
Coccia and Watts, 2020). In short, the concentration in specific areas of a combination of climate with low wind, a
specific urban climatology of hinterland cities, high polluting industrialization, aspects of regional topography and
physical geography sustains, in fall and winter season, the stagnation of air pollution and particulate compounds
emissions that seems to have supported the spread of COVID-19 infection (cf., Contini and Costabile, 2020;
Conticini et al., 2020; Fattorini and Regoli, 2020). New findings here show that geo-environmental factors may have
accelerated the spread of COVID-19 in northern Italian cities, leading to a higher number of infected individuals
and deaths.
The results here also suggested that, among Italian provincial capitals, the number of infected people was higher in
cities with >100 days per year exceeding limits set for PM10 or ozone, cities located in hinterland zones (i.e. away
from the coast), cities having a low average intensity of wind energy production and cities with a lower temperature.
In hinterland cities (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with a high number of days exceeding PM10
and ozone limits, coupled with low wind speed, the average number of infected people in April more than doubled.

Socioeconomic shocks can lead to a general increase of prices, high public debts, high unemployment, income inequality and
as a consequence violent behavior (Coccia, 2016, 2017, 2017a).

These findings provide valuable insight into geo-environmental and industrial factors that may accelerate the
diffusion of COVID-19 and similar viral agents. In this context, a proactive strategy to help cope with future
epidemics should concentrate on reducing levels of air pollution in hinterland and polluted cities.
However, these conclusions are of course tentative because there are several challenges to such studies, particularly
in real time because the sources can only capture certain aspects of the on-going complex relations between polluting
industrialization, diffusion of viral infectivity and other resources of economic systems. This study therefore
encourages further investigations on these aspects of the diffusion of COVID-19 outbreaks in highly industrialized
areas to design appropriate sustainable policies that can provide lung-run public health measures to reduce air
pollution and control the spread of infection similar to COVID-19 (Ou et al., 2020). Overall, then, in the presence
of high polluting industrialization and low renewable energy production of regions that can support diffusion of
epidemics in environment with high level of air pollution and particulate compounds emissions, this study has to
suggest that a comprehensive strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 must be designed in terms
of sustainability science with a high incidence of cleaner production in socioeconomic systems.
