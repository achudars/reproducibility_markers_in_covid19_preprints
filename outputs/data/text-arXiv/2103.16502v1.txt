Abstract— This paper is concerned with the design of intermittent non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate the spread
of the COVID-19 epidemic exploiting network epidemiological
models. Specifically, by studying a variational equation for the
dynamics of the infected in a network model of the epidemic
spread, we derive, using contractivity arguments, a condition
that can be used to guarantee that, in epidemiological terms, the
effective reproduction number is less than unity. This condition
has three advantages: (i) it is easily computable; (ii) it is
directly related to the model parameters; (iii) it can be used to
enforce a scalability condition that prohibits the amplification
of disturbances within the network system. We then include
satisfaction of such a condition as a constraint in a Model
Predictive Control problem so as to mitigate (or suppress)
the spread of the epidemic while minimizing the economic
impact of the interventions. A data-driven model of Italy as
a network of three macro-regions (North, Center, and South),
whose parameters are identified from real data, is used to
illustrate and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control
strategy.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Because of recent events, the design of control strategies
aimed at mitigating the spread of epidemic processes has
suddenly become a major pressing research problem with
clear societal and economic impacts [1], [2]. Among these
strategies, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are essential measures to contain the transmission of the virus
for both mitigating or suppressing the epidemic (see [3] [4]
for further details on the definition and difference between
mitigation and suppression strategies).
In this context, two key challenges are: (i) devising proxies
to detect the onset of the epidemic spreading; (ii) synthesize
control strategies that balance the need of containing the
epidemic with the need of reducing its economic impact.
In this paper, we consider network epidemic models.
For these models we give a sufficient condition, which
directly depends on the model parameters, ensuring that the
epidemological effective reproduction number R 𝑡 is less than
unity and that the infected population decreases to zero.
Then, we consider a network model of Italy parameterized on
real data and obtain a set of intermittent non-pharmaceutical
intervention strategies at the regional level by formulating a
constrained optimization problem that is solved via Model

Predictive Control (MPC). The formulation embeds our
condition as a constraint and is based on the minimization of
an economic cost function. The resulting strategy is able to
mitigate (or even suppress) the spread of the disease while
minimizing its overall impact on the economy.
Related work: A fast intermittent lockdown strategy was
proposed in [1] with the goal of using periodic interventions to alleviate the effects of measurement uncertainty.
Following a similar argument, a cyclic periodic lockdown
strategy was studied in [5], while a stepping down policy was
presented in [6]. The use of feedback to dynamically adapt
the intervention strategies as a function of the epidemic state
was suggested in several papers in the recent literature. For
example, in [7], several feedback intervention strategies are
presented, while in [8] the benefits were shown of adopting
feedback intermittent regional control strategies triggered
by occupancy levels of the intensive care units (ICUs)
in each region. Also, several epidemic control strategies
were recently proposed which are based on using an MPC
approach. These include [9], where MPC is used to decide
whether to enforce social distancing in a region/country of
interest. Therein, the model used to synthesize the control
strategy is a SIRASDC model (𝑆: susceptible, 𝐼: infected,
𝑅: recovered, 𝐴: asymptomatic, 𝑆: symptomatic, 𝐷: dead, 𝐶:
with control) and hard constraints on ICUs occupancy and
minimal dwell time of the control window were explicitly
included in the formulation. MPC was also implemented
on a number of different models, e.g. a SIDARTHE model
(𝑆: susceptible, 𝐼: infected, 𝐷: diagnosed, 𝐴: ailing, 𝑅:
recognized, 𝑇: threatened, 𝐻: healed, 𝐸: extinct) in [10], a
SEAIR model (𝑆: susceptible, 𝐸: exposed, 𝐴: asymptomatic
infected, 𝐼: confirmed infections, 𝑅: recovered) in [11], or
a multi-region SIRQTHE network model (𝑆: susceptible, 𝐼:
infected, 𝑅: recovered, 𝑄: quarantined, 𝑇: threatened, 𝐻:
healed, 𝐸: extinct) in [12].
M ATHEMATICAL P RELIMINARIES
In the rest of this paper, we denote by I the identity
matrix of appropriate dimensions, by 0 and 1 column vectors
of appropriate dimensions consisting of all zeros and ones,
respectively; k·k 𝑞 denotes the vector 𝑞-norm and its induced
matrix norm, and R𝑛0 is the positive orthant in R𝑛 (including
the axes). We also let N ≥0 and N>0 be the sets of semipositive
and positive natural numbers, respectively. Also, we use
A  0 to indicate that all elements 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 of a given matrix are
such that 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 ≥ 0, ∀𝑖, 𝑗 (analogous element-wise definitions
hold for , , ≺). Finally, we recall the following lemma.

Lemma 1 ( [13], p. 368). Let B1 , B2 ∈ R𝑛×𝑛 , with 𝑛 ∈ N>0 .
If B1  0, B2  0, and B1  B2 , then kB1 k ≤ kB2 k.
II. M ODEL DESCRIPTION
To model the dynamics of the epidemic, we adapted and
updated a network model that was originally presented and
validated in [8]. We re-parameterized and updated the model
with real data related to the spread of the epidemic in Italy
collected by the National Civil Protection Authority [14],
between February 24, 2020 and February 25, 2021. The
model comprises 𝑀 = 3 macro-regions corresponding to the
North (including the regions Piedmont, Lombardy, Liguria,
Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Emilia
Romagna), the Center (Tuscany, Umbria, Marche, Lazio,
Abruzzo), and the South (Molise, Campania, Basilicata,
Apulia, Calabria, Sicily, Sardinia) of the Italian peninsula.
The dynamics of the disease in each region 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝑀,
𝑀 = 3, is captured by a SIQHDR model, describing the
time evolution of the number of susceptible (𝑆𝑖 ), (undetected)
infected (𝐼𝑖 ), quarantined (𝑄 𝑖 ), hospitalized (𝐻𝑖 ), deceased
(𝐷 𝑖 ), and recovered (𝑅𝑖 ) as a function of time 𝑡. We also
define S B [𝑆1 · · · 𝑆 𝑀 ] T , I B [𝐼1 · · · 𝐼 𝑀 ] T , Q B
[𝑄 1 · · · 𝑄 𝑀 ] T , H B [𝐻1 · · · 𝐻 𝑀 ] T , D B [𝐷 1 · · · 𝐷 𝑀 ] T ,
R B [𝑅1 · · · 𝑅 𝑀 ] T , and let x B [ST IT QT HT DT RT ] T ∈
R18
0 be the state vector of the model. Moreover, for each pair
(𝑖, 𝑗) of macro-regions, the quantity 𝜙𝑖 𝑗 (𝑡) ∈ [0, 1] describes
the fraction of people in region 𝑖 that commute and interact
with people in region 𝑗 returning to their region of origin at
the end of each day 𝑡 (see also [15]).
The resulting network model we consider is

Additionally, 𝑁𝑖 is the population in region 𝑖 that is currently
free-to-move, while 𝑁𝑖 is the total population in region 𝑖. As
in [8], we also estimate the number of patients requiring
treatment in intensive care as 10% of the those who are
hospitalized. Moreover, letting 𝑇𝑖𝐻 be the maximum number
of beds in the ICUs of region 𝑖 [16], [17], following [8] we

Social distancing: The parameter 𝜌𝑖 (𝑡) ∈ [0, 1] models
the effect of social distancing (including the use of personal
protective equipment such as face masks) in region 𝑖 and is
assumed to be time-varying. Namely, 𝜌𝑖 = 1 corresponds to
the absence of social distancing measures, whereas 𝜌𝑖 = 0
means that contact between people is forbidden. Intermediate
values indicate different levels of social distancing.

where we stressed the dependency of 𝚿 on the state vector
and the parameters, and where

Ψ𝑖 𝑗 (x, u) :=
is the influx from region 𝑖 to region 𝑗 in the absence of
travel restrictions. In particular, 𝜑𝑖 = 1 means that travel
to/from region 𝑖 is possible, whereas 𝜑𝑖 = 0 implies that it
is forbidden.
Testing: The effect of testing-and-tracing is captured by
the parameter 𝛼𝑖 in (1), which models the rate at which
undetected infected 𝐼𝑖 are moved to the quarantined compartment 𝑄 𝑖 . To describe the ability of a region to modulate
the amount of testing carried out within its territory, we set
𝛼𝑖 (𝑡) = 𝛼0 + 𝜎𝑖 (𝑡) 𝛼,
˜ where 𝜎𝑖 (𝑡) ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter
denoting the testing capacity of region 𝑖 on day 𝑡 so that
testing is set to the minimal level, 𝛼0 ∈ R>0 , when 𝜎𝑖 = 0,
or to its maximal value, 𝛼0 + 𝛼,
˜ when 𝜎𝑖 = 1.
The values 𝛼0 and 𝛼˜ were identified as 𝛼0 = 0.0671 and
𝛼˜ = 0.0806 by performing a linear regression of the data
collected by each Italian region in the time window April
22, 2020–February 25, 2021 as reported in Figure 1.
A crucial quantity to assess the rate of propagation of
an epidemic disease is the reproduction number, defined
in epidemiology as “the number of secondary infections
generated by one infected person” [19]. Typically, the basic reproduction number R 0 is computed when the entire
population is assumed to be susceptible [20], [21], while
the effective reproduction number R 𝑡 is estimated from data
[19], [22]. Specifically, the effective reproduction number of
region 𝑖, denoted by R 𝑡 ,𝑖 , can be estimated via the method
described in [23, §8]. That is, by computing
Í𝑡
𝑘=𝑡−3 [(𝑁𝑖 − 𝑆 𝑖 (𝑘)) − (𝑁𝑖 − 𝑆 𝑖 (𝑘 − 1))]
. (5)
R 𝑡 ,𝑖 = Í𝑡−4
𝑘=𝑡−7 [(𝑁𝑖 − 𝑆 𝑖 (𝑘)) − (𝑁𝑖 − 𝑆 𝑖 (𝑘 − 1))]
Note that while an analytical expression of R 0 for network
epidemic models can be found in the existing literature, e.g.
[15], [24], an algebraic expression for R 𝑡 does not exist in
a closed form at the moment for this kind of models. Later
in Section III, we derive a sufficient condition to ensure that
R 𝑡 (for the network) is below the critical unitary threshold.

B. A sufficient condition for epidemic containment
Next, we use (6) and (8) to give a simple yet effective
condition to (i) enforce suppression of the epidemic and (ii)
to ensure that the number of secondary infections generated
by perturbing the number of infected along a trajectory
decays exponentially to zero.
Proposition 1. Assume that there exists some matrix norm,
say k·k 𝑞 , and some constant 𝑐 < 1 such that
kI + 𝚿( x̄(𝑡), ū(𝑡)) k 𝑞 ≤ 𝑐 < 1,

∀𝑡 ≥ 𝑡 0 , 𝑡0 ∈ N ≥0 . (10)

Then, (i) Ī(𝑡) 𝑞 ≤ 𝑐 𝑡−𝑡0 Ī(𝑡 0 ) 𝑞 for all 𝑡 ≥ 𝑡 0 , and (ii)
k𝛿I(𝑡) k 𝑞 ≤ 𝑐 𝑡−𝑡0 k𝛿I(𝑡0 )k 𝑞 for all 𝑡 ≥ 𝑡0 .
Proof. We start by proving (i), which is obvious for 𝑡 = 𝑡 0 .
For 𝑡 > 𝑡0 we notice that, from (6), we have

0 ,
𝑡 0 ∈ N ≥0 , when u(𝑡) is equal to ū(𝑡).
Additionally, denote by 𝛿I(𝑡) the variation around Ī(𝑡) due
to perturbations of the infected only (in the terminology
of contraction theory this is a “virtual displacement”, as
defined in [25], obtained by considering only variations of the
infected). After some algebraic manipulations, the dynamics
of the virtual displacement 𝛿I(𝑡) can be given as

and hence (i) follows.
To prove (ii), it suffices to show that (10) implies
kI + 𝚿( x̄(𝑡), ū(𝑡)) + 𝚪( x̄(𝑡), ū(𝑡)) k 𝑞 ≤ 𝑐 < 1,
∀𝑡 ≥ 𝑡 0 , 𝑡0 ∈ N ≥0 ,

(11)

and repeat the steps used to prove (i), considering (8). To
show this, let
B1 (𝑡) B I + 𝚿( x̄(𝑡), ū(𝑡)) + 𝚪( x̄(𝑡), ū(𝑡)),

B2 (𝑡) B I + 𝚿( x̄(𝑡), ū(𝑡)).

We now give an interpretation of Proposition 1 in terms
of R 𝑡 . We start with noticing that R 𝑡 is typically defined
in qualitative terms in epidemiology as the variation in the
number of infected due to the perturbation in the number of
infected (see Section II). From this definition it stems that if
𝑀
𝑀
∑︁
∑︁
𝛿𝐼𝑖 (𝑡 + 1) <
𝛿𝐼𝑖 (𝑡),
(15)
𝑖=1

and therefore the total variation of infected along a trajectory
goes to zero, than it must be that R 𝑡 < 1. Note that condition
(15) is satisfied by fulfilling condition (10) in Proposition 1
with k·k 1 . Additionally, note that using the ∞-norm, k·k ∞ ,
condition (10) yields

Clearly, if 𝐴𝑖 ≤ 𝑐 < 1, ∀𝑖, ∀𝑡 ≥ 𝑡 0 , then (10) in Proposition
1 holds, with the infinity norm, and the infected population
decreases to zero. Thus, the control goal can be formulated
as that of solving the following constrained optimization
problem
U [1,𝑇 −1]

∀𝑘.

Hence, recalling (12), we get from (3) that B1 (𝑡)  0,
∀𝑡 ≥ 𝑡 0 . Moreover, (14) also implies that B1 (𝑡)  B2 (𝑡),
∀𝑡 ∈ N ≥0 . Hence, exploiting Lemma 1 and (10), we have
kB1 (𝑡) k ≤ kB2 (𝑡) k ≤ 𝑐, ∀𝑡 ≥ 𝑡 0 , which is used to get (11)
and thus (ii) is proved.

Recalling (3), (7) and (13), we have B2 (𝑡)  0, ∀𝑡 ∈ N ≥0 .
Additionally, we have
𝚪(x, u)  0,

Suppression of the epidemic: First, we consider the problem of finding the cheapest strategies in terms of social distancing (𝝆) and travel restrictions (𝝋) that enforce suppression of the epidemic, assuming testing (𝝈) is not increased
beyond its nominal value. To this aim, we define—omitting
time dependence for the sake of brevity,

(16)

and this in turn implies that the maximum variation of
infected across all regions in the model decreases over time.
We argue that condition (10) as expressed in (16) might
be effectively used to assess quantitatively the trend of an
epidemic spread. Note that the use of the infinity norm
also prohibits the amplification of (bounded deterministic)
disturbance on the infected dynamics within the network
system as recently noted in [26, Remark 6].
As proven in the Appendix, Proposition 1 can also be
related to a condition independently obtained in [27] when
specialized to a SIS network model (see the Appendix for
the formal statement and further details).
IV. C ONTROL PROBLEM FORMULATION
We now formulate our control problems, aimed at either
mitigating or suppressing an epidemic, using a combination
of different control actions, while minimizing the economic
impact of the measures.

(18a)

𝐽 [1,𝑇 ] ,
(1),

∀𝑡,

𝐴𝑖 (x(𝑡), u(𝑡)) ≤ 𝑐 < 1,

∀𝑖, ∀𝑡,

𝜌𝑖 ∈ S𝜌 , 𝜑𝑖 ∈ S 𝜑 , 𝜎𝑖 = 0,

(18b)

∀𝑖, ∀𝑡,

𝑤u ≥ 𝜏∗ ,

(18c)

where 𝐽 [1,𝑇 ] is the economic cost function over the time
window [1, 𝑇], and will be presented in Section IV-A,
U [1,𝑇 −1] B (u(1), u(2), . . . , u(𝑇 − 1)) is the set of all
decision variables, S𝜌 , S 𝜑 are sets of possible values of 𝜌𝑖
and 𝜑𝑖 which will be selected in Section V, and 𝑤 u (𝑡) is the
dwell time on u (i.e. (18c) means that the value of u cannot
change before at least 𝜏 ∗ ∈ N>0 days have passed since the
last change).
Mitigation of the epidemic: To better preserve the economy, and as currently done in many countries affected by
the epidemic, we also study a different approach, where the
goal is to control the epidemic spread allowing some of the
restrictions to be lifted when certain conditions are met and
enforced otherwise.
To this aim, we obtain a relaxation of condition (10), by
considering the condition
∀𝑖,

if 𝜋𝑖 (𝑡) =⇒ 𝐴𝑖 (x(𝑡), u(𝑡)) ≤ 𝑐 < 1.

(19)

where 𝜋𝑖 (𝑡) is a Boolean condition associated to the “criticality” of the epidemic situation in region 𝑖, that we choose
as
(
1, 0.1𝐻𝑖 (𝑡) ≥ 𝜖 𝐻 𝑇𝑖𝐻 ∨ R 𝑡 ,𝑖 ≥ 𝜖 R ,
𝜋𝑖 (𝑡) =
(20)
0, otherwise,
linking it to the level of saturation of the ICUs in each region
and the value of R 𝑡 ,𝑖 in each region estimated using (5), with
𝜖 𝐻 ∈ (0, 1], 𝜖 R ∈ R>0 . The resulting control problem can be
then be formulated as (18) with (18b) substituted by (19).
The effect of testing: Finally, we explore if and how
increasing the amount of testing beyond the nominal value
in each region can further reduce costs by formulating the
problem as (18) where the constraint on 𝜎𝑖 is chosen as
𝜎𝑖 ∈ S 𝜎 , S 𝜎 being a set of possible values of 𝜎𝑖 selected
later in Section V.

A. Cost function

Variable

Value

As a cost function for the optimization problems above, we
consider the total economic cost of the measures undertaken
by each region, computed accounting for the cost of people
not being able to work and the cost of testing.
Let 𝑃active,𝑖 (𝑡) B 𝑆𝑖 (𝑡) + 𝐼𝑖 (𝑡) + 𝑅𝑖 (𝑡); 𝑐 m = e83.992 be
the mean daily GDP pro-capita in Italy as reported in [28],
𝑐 w = 0.617 be the fraction of people that are not able to
work when social distancing is in place [29], and 𝑐 𝛼 be the
daily cost of carrying out maximal testing, normalized over
the population.
Then, the economic cost at time 𝑡 in region 𝑖 is given by

V. MPC IMPLEMENTATION AND VALIDATION
We solved the control problems described in the previous
section by using a Model Predictive Control approach [31].
As reported in Table II, we chose the set of possible
values of the control inputs 𝜌𝑖 , 𝜑𝑖 and 𝜎𝑖 to represent
different levels of social distancing, travel restrictions and
testing levels, respectively. For 𝜌𝑖 we approximated the
values of this parameters estimated in [8] for each of the
Italian regions when different levels of social distancing were
enforced, while for 𝜑𝑖 we replicated the decrease of 70% in
mobility fluxes among regions as registered in [32] during
the first months of the Italian national lockdown (FebruaryMay 2020). As for the level of testing in each region, we
chose three representative values of 𝜎𝑖 ∈ S 𝜎 , to represent
low, medium, and intense testing levels (see Table II).
We also enforced the constraint that the control input
cannot change before 𝜏 ∗ days have passed since its last
change, similarly to what done in [9], [33]. Formally, the
control strategy on day 𝑡 can be changed only if 𝜏(𝑡) = 𝜏 ∗ ,
where 𝜏(𝑡) is the number of days (up to 𝜏 ∗ ), counting back
from 𝑡 (excluding 𝑡), such that the control variables stayed
equal to the value they had in 𝑡 − 1. To compute 𝜏(𝑡), we
initialize 𝜏(1) = 0, and update 𝜏 according to the law
(
min{𝜏(𝑡) + 1, 𝜏 ∗ }, if u(𝑡) = u(𝑡 − 1),
𝜏(𝑡 + 1) =
(28)
1,
otherwise.
A. Numerical results
Using a prediction horizon 𝑇p , as reported in Table II,
and 𝑑 = 0.9 in (27), the optimization problem is solved
using a genetic algorithm implemented in MATLAB 2020
[34], with the parameters reported in Table III. To simplify
computations, when 𝜏(𝑡) = 𝜏 ∗ , if the MPC finds that u(𝑡) can
be applied continuously for 𝑚 days, and that u(𝑡) = u(𝑡 − 1),

we apply u(𝑡) for min(𝑚, 𝑙MPC ) days (rather than just one
day).
1) Epidemic suppression: We can observe the solution to
(18) (with constraint (18b)) in Figure 2. As expected, the
epidemic is effectively eradicated by the control strategy, as
the number of infected people asymptotically goes to zero.
However, this strategy is particularly expensive with a total
cost of e421.989 · 109 (computed with 𝑑 = 1).
2) Mitigation: The results of the control strategy when
applied to solve (18) with constraint (19) is reported in
Figure 3. In this case, the total cost was found to be equal to
e337.172 · 109 , that is significantly lower than the previous
scenario. This is a consequence of the fact that, in each
region, NPIs interventions are taken only when some safety
thresholds are met and only in that specific region. At the
same time, the number of people in ICUs remains within
capacity, and all regional effective reproduction numbers
remain within acceptable values.
3) Effect of additional testing: Finally, we report the
solution to the problem when 𝜎𝑖 ∈ S 𝜎 in Figure 4, with the
total cost found to be equal to e262.379 · 109 , that is even

lower than the previous case. Clearly, the use of additional
testing as a further measure allows the control to further
reduce costs by relying less on increasing social distancing
to mitigate the epidemic, avoiding saturation of the regional
health systems. Indeed, in Figure 4, it is possible to note
that travel restrictions are never used in this case, and social
distancing is significantly less severe when compared to that
in Figures 2 and 3.
VI. C ONCLUSIONS
We considered the problem of designing localized intermittent non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies to mitigate
the COVID-19 epidemic in a regional model of the Italian
epidemic. We first gave a sufficient condition to determine
the stability of the infected population, in a network epidemic

model. We then exploited this stability condition, or a relaxed
version of it, as a constraint to formulate the control problem
as an optimization problem in which the levels of social
distancing, travel restrictions and additional testing must be
selected to avoid saturation of the regional health systems and
containment (or suppression) of the epidemic spread while
minimizing the overall cost to the economy. Our results show
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

A PPENDIX
For the sake of completeness, we explore here the relationship between the stability condition in Proposition 1 and
a recent condition derived independently in [27], when both
are applied to a discrete-time SIS model (adapted from the
continuous-time model adopted in [27]).
Namely, the dynamics of the infected we consider is given
by


I(𝑡 + 1) = (1 − 𝛾)I + diag(1 − I(𝑡)) 𝛽A I(𝑡),
(29)
where 𝐼𝑖 ∈ [0, 1] is the portion of infected in region 𝑖, with
𝑖 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝑀 }, I B [𝐼1 · · · 𝐼 𝑀 ] T , 0 ≤ 𝛽 ≤ 1 is the
infection rate, 0 ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1 is the recovery rate, A ∈ R 𝑀 ×𝑀
captures the rate at which infection flows between regions
(also accounting for social distancing), with A  0, and
diag(v) is a diagonal matrix having on its main diagonal
the vector v.
Next, we derive and compare two different upper bounds
on the maximum eigenvalue of A, that guarantee the stability
of the infected dynamics in the origin. The first bound, say

(B1), is derived following the arguments in Proposition 1,
whereas the second, say (B2), is computed following the
steps in [27].
Bound derived from Proposition 1: By using similar
arguments as those used in Proposition 1, it can be shown
that, if there exists some matrix norm and some 𝑐 < 1 such
that
k (1 − 𝛾)I + diag(1 − I(𝑡)) 𝛽Ak ≤ 𝑐,

∀𝑡 ∈ N ≥0 ,

(30)

𝐼 m (𝑡)

kI(𝑡 0 ) k for all 𝑡 ≥ 𝑡 0 . Letting
then kI(𝑡) k ≤
B
min𝑖 𝐼𝑖 (𝑡), and applying the triangle inequality and Lemma
1, we find that (30) is satisfied if
𝑐 𝑡−𝑡0

kAk ≤

𝛾+𝑐−1
1
,
1 − 𝐼 m (𝑡)
𝛽

∀𝑡 ∈ N ≥0 ,

(31)

where we used the fact that the variables 𝐼𝑖 (𝑡) are bounded
between 0 and 1. As kAk ≥ 𝜆max (A), then there exists 𝑝 ∈
(0, 1] such that 𝑝 kAk = 𝜆max (A). Thus, we rewrite (31) and
obtain the first bound as
𝛾+𝑐−1
𝑝
.
(B1)
𝜆max (A) ≤ 𝑔1 B
1 − 𝐼 m (𝑡)
𝛽
Bound derived from [27]: Following the arguments in
[27], we let P B (1 − 𝛾)I + 𝛽A, noting that P  0. Applying
the Perron-Frobenius theorem [13, Theorem 8.3.1] to PT
yields the existence of an eigenvalue 𝜆max (P) ≥ 0, with
associated left eigenvector vmax  0. Moreover, 𝜆max (P) is
such that 𝜆max (P) ≥ |𝜆𝑖 (P)|, for all other eigenvalues 𝜆𝑖 of
P. Now, if
𝛾+𝑐−1
𝜆max (A) ≤ 𝑔2 B
,
(B2)
𝛽
(which constitutes the second bound), we consequently get
𝜆 max (P) ≤ 𝑐 < 1, and it is then immediate to show that this
implies that 0 is a stable equilibrium for the dynamics I(𝑡)
given in (29). Indeed, we have

T

vmax I(𝑡 + 1) = vmax (1 − 𝛾)I + diag(1 − I(𝑡)) 𝛽A I(𝑡)
T

T

T

≤ vmax PI(𝑡) = 𝜆max (P)vmax I(𝑡) ≤ 𝑐vmax I(𝑡),
which means stability of I(𝑡) in 0 recalling that I(𝑡)  0
and vmax  0. Note that (B2) is equivalent to the stability
condition in Proposition 3.1 in [27] when applied to a
discrete-time SIS network model.
Comparison: Finally, we relate the two stability conditions
(B1) and (B2). Clearly, when 𝐼 m (𝑡) ∈ (1 − 𝑝, 1), 𝑔1 > 𝑔2 and
our condition (B1) is less conservative than (B2), while it is
more conservative (𝑔1 < 𝑔2 ) when 𝐼 m (𝑡) ∈ [0, 1 − 𝑝).
