Abstract. The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has impacted various aspects of the world from tourism, business, education, and many more.
Like for every country, the global pandemic has imposed similar effects
on Ghana. During this period, citizens of this country have used social
networks as a platform to find and disseminate information about the
infectious disease and also share their own opinions and sentiments. In
this study, we use text mining to draw insights from data collected from
the social network, Twitter. Our exploration of the data led us to understand the most frequent topics raised in the Greater Accra region of
Ghana from March to July 2020. We observe that the engagement of
users of this social network was initially high in March but declined from
April to July. The reason was probably that the people were becoming
more adapted to the situation after an initial shock when the disease
was announced in the country. We also found certain words in these
users tweets that enabled us to understand the sentiments and mental
state of individuals at the time.

Introduction

The global pandemic, COVID-19, formally known as the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) [1], was declared a pandemic and a
global threat by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11-03-2020 [2].
Since December 2019, when its outbreak was first announced in the city of
Wuhan in China, the disease has spread very rapidly to many other countries.
As of 11-03-2020, when the disease was declared a global pandemic, a total of
6,546 cases and 355 deaths had been recorded by WHO [3].
Ghana had its first imported case of COVID-19 in Accra, the nations capital,
and the regional capital of the Greater Accra Region, on 12-03- 2020 [4],[5].

The disease then rapidly spread across the other regions. As of 3-08-2020, 10:35
GMT+2, a total of 37,014 cases had been confirmed. The Greater Accra Region
alone accounted for about 18,882, which is about 51% of the total cases in
Ghana[6]. Figure 1 summarized the events from Ghana, etween March-July.

The coronavirus disease is caused by a pathogen that attacks the respiratory
system of humans. Non-infected persons may contract the disease after physical
contact with an infected person or contaminated surfaces and objects. The disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, and tiredness, which manifests within
14 days of infection. Other symptoms include diarrhea, sore throat, conjunctivitis, headache, and loss of taste and smell [7], [8]. To slow down and control
the spread of the virus, The WHO defined some measures in the absence of an
approved cure [9].
Many governments soon adopted and implemented these measures in their
own countries. These measures include physical distancing between persons,
wearing face masks, avoiding physical interactions like handshaking, and hugging, and lockdowns, etc[10]. These measures have been communicated to individuals through various communication channels, including social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, etc.
As a result, concerned individuals and public health officials are able to stay
up to date with research findings, statistical and precautionary measures. Others
use these platforms to share their own opinions and sentiments towards media
reports or news[11]. A careful analysis of what individuals talk about will help
satisfy digital epidemiological needs for efficient disease surveillance and case
severity analysis. Healthcare providers or policymakers will then understand
the state of the situation, thereby making it easy to reach out with available
remedies[12].

In this work, we use data sourced from Twitter, which is the most used
social network after Facebook and YouTube[13] by a section of the Ghanaian
population in the Greater Accra Region.
We contribute by providing a data-based assessment of the COVID-19 situation and the populations response. This will aid healthcare providers and educators to assess how individuals at the target location feel, respond and understand
matters concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on this information, healthcare needs and decisions that are more suited to the population can be made
and implemented.

Proposal

This section describes the proposal to analyze the situation in the country of
Ghana in detail. The next step are part of the proposal:
–
–
–
–
2.1

Select keywords related to covid19 pandemic
Set the parameters to collect related data
Pre-processing text
Visualization to support Analysis
Select relevant terms

The scope of the analysis is the Greater Accra region of Ghana. This choice was
informed by the concentration of the population and access to the internet. The
search terms used to retrieve information from the social network are:
– ’covid’, ’coronavirus’, ’sars’
2.2

Build the Query and Collect Data

Twitter is a social network with thousands of users sending micro-messages,
up to 240 characters. Then, the collection process is through Twitter Search
function using the parameters that follow:
–
–
–
–
–

2.3

date: 01-03-2020 to 15-07-2020
terms: the chosen words mentioned in previous subsection
geolocalization: 5.646129,-0.065209, see Fig. 2
language: English
radius: 25.3347 km

Preprocessing Data

In this step, the following procedures are taken to remove unwanted words and
characters while maintaining the relevant ones. We also create visualisations to
support our analysis and visual understanding.

Uppercase to lowercase
Eliminate alphanumeric symbols
Remove stopwords, i.e. articles, pronouns, etc.
Remove custom stopwords, i.e. coronavirus, covid, sars

The last step is useful to avoid coronavirus keywords and discover other terms
related to the topic. According to the objective, this set of words can be chosen.
2.4

Visualization

After cleaning the data, the text is ready to create graphics to help the understanding of the situation in Ghana during the last months.
– Bar plots to show the frequency of tweets per day, per month
– Cloud of words to visualize the most frequent terms per month
– Line plots to show the trend of data

How is the frequency of post in the Greater Accra Region?

First, it is important to know how many tweets/posts related to the topic of the
study because this can express the interest of the users about the topic around
covid-19 pandemic. Figure 3, shows March and April had the highest number of
posts and from April there is less tweets month after month.

Splitting the previous graphic, it is possible to show the frequency daily.
Then, figure 4 can summarize this information. Observing this graphic, from
01 to 27 March there is a constant increasing number of tweets but after 27
March, it starts to decrease. There are some peaks on March(27), April(13,19),
May(19,31), June(14,24) and July(02), these numbers could be related to some
events in the region.

The highlighted dates can be the start of an elaborated study around these
days, then the study can be extended.
3.3

Relevant terms during the months?

The terms: covid19, coronavirus, sars were extracted because the intention is to
know the most frequent terms around these keywords per month. First, graphic

Next figure 7 presents the most frequent N-grams with N=2,3 to perform a
better analysis about the previous terms. By consequence, it possible to confirm
most of the tweets are related to actions of government, i.e. president akufo addo,
stay home, taken combat spread, update measure taken.
3.4

Understanding sentiments of the people

The choice of words of users on social networks indicates their attitude and
feeling about the situation they post about. In this section, we focus on words
that conveys sentiments of the user from their composition. We categorized the
pre-processed tokens into three namely; positive, negative and neutral based on
their polarity scores.
In figure 8, frequently occurring words across months are “death”, “die”,
“kill”. These words suggests that people were worried about the alarming death

rate of the pandemic and the cause of the panic among them. Again, “racism”
appears in May and more frequently in June pointing out another cause of
distress that likely surrounds the issues and behaviours against racial minorities.

What is the relationship between Twitter Posts, Daily
Reported Cases and Google Trends?

A valid question arises, how related can be posts of users with the actual pandemic? Therefore, graphic 9 presents the daily reported new cases, interest of
users about Google search and Twitter posts.
The scale of Twitter posts was adapted to have values between 0-100 like
Google trends. The data to elaborate graphic related to daily cases was downloaded from HDX website 3 .
There is visual correlation between searches about coronavirus topic and
messasges posted daily. The interest of user has decreased during the time, it

can be the result of many social, mental effects produced by lockdown or constant
fear facing the pandemic. An opposite results with a increasing number of cases
in the country, people can be tired of the context and started to adapt and
reactivate their lives. This analysis is open for future work.

Conclusions

First, Twitter can be a useful source of data. Process to analyze text includes the
cleaning of the text. Second, there was an increasing interest on the pandemic
as topic in Ghana user at the beginning, during the first reported cases. But,
during the time, the interest about the pandemic were decreasing. The evidence
for this affirmation is found in Google searches, Twitter posts daily, in spite of
the number of new cases still is growing up.
