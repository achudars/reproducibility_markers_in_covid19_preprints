Abstract
Many sports leagues are played in a tightly scheduled round-robin format, leaving
a limited time window to postpone matches. If the season cannot resume due to
an external shock such as the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the ranking of the
teams becomes non-trivial: it is necessary to account for schedule imbalances and
possibly for the different number of matches played. First in the literature, we
identify a set of desired axioms for ranking in these incomplete tournaments and
verify that the generalized row sum, a parametric family of scoring rules, satisfies
all of them. In particular, the well-established least squares method maximizes the
role of the opponents. Our approach is applied for six major premier European
soccer competitions, where the rankings are found to be robust concerning the weight
of adjustment for the strength of the opponents. Some methodologically simpler
alternative policies are also discussed.

Introduction

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) stopped almost all sports leagues
around the world. Some of them never resumed: the German premier men’s handball
league, the 2019/20 Handball-Bundesliga, was canceled on 21 April 2020 (Web24 News,
2020); the Dutch soccer league, the 2019/20 Eredivisie ended with immediate effect on
25 April 2020 (Sky Sports, 2020); and the French Prime Minister announced on 28 April
2020 that the 2019/20 sporting season is over (BBC, 2020). Therefore, several organizers
have faced an unenviable dilemma: how to decide the final ranking in the 2019/20 season?
Should all results be abandoned? Should the current standing be frozen? Should a
reasonable subset of the matches be considered? Since the sports industry is a billion
dollars business, the answer has huge financial consequences as promotion and relegation,
qualification for international cups, and the allocation of broadcasting revenue (Bergantiños
and Moreno-Ternero, 2020) all depend on the league ranking.
For instance, the Hungarian Handball Federation canceled all results in the 2019/20
season (Stregspiller, 2020). The implications for the 2019/20 Hungarian women’s handball
league were quite dramatic. With eight matches left to play from the total of 26, the
runner-up Siófok had an advantage of two points—the reward of a win—ahead of the
third-placed Ferencváros. However, based on the result of the previous 2018/19 season,
Ferencváros obtained the second slot in the 2020/21 EHF Champions League for Hungary.
Thus Siófok, which finished third in the 2018/19 season, can enter only the less lucrative
and prestigious EHF Cup, a competition it already won in 2019. Unsurprisingly, the
strange decision ignited some controversy (Stregspiller, 2020), especially because Győri
Audi ETO KC—the Hungarian club that won the last three editions of the Women’s
EHF Champions League, the most prestigious club tournament in women’s handball—was
defeated by Siófok on 22 January 2020, the first loss of Győr after more than two years.
On the other hand, the best 36 German men’s handball clubs voted by a large majority
to evaluate the 2019/20 season according to the so-called quotient rule, the number of
points scored per game (Web24 News, 2020). In addition, the top two clubs were promoted
from the second division but there was no relegation. Even though Füchse Berlin dropped
from the fifth to the sixth place due to playing one match more despite its one point
advantage over Rhein-Neckar Löwen, and thus missed participation in the EHF Cup, its
managing director acknowledged that there is no fair solution in this situation.
The current paper aims to propose a fair ranking in similar incomplete round-robin
tournaments. The main challenge resides in taking into account the varying strength of
the opponents. We follow an axiomatic approach and find that a family of scoring rules,
the generalized row sum method, performs well from this point of view. Its parameter
reflects the weight of the adjustment for the strength of the opponents, which is maximized
by the least squares method, a well-established procedure in social choice theory and
statistics. According to our computations for six major European soccer leagues, the
current ranking—after corrected for the number of matches played, similarly to the 2019/20
Handball-Bundesliga—remains robust to the role of the opponents.
Naturally, the problem of predicting the winner of an interrupted game has a long
history since the correspondence of Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat (Weisberg, 2014,
Appendix: The Pascal–Fermat Correspondence of 1654). There exist a plethora of
statistical techniques to determine the number of points that a team would have won on
average in the rest of the season. However, sports administrators are usually not keen
to grab such sophisticated mathematical models, even though cricket has adopted the

2

Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method (Duckworth and Lewis, 1998; Stern, 2009; Wright, 2009).
This inspired us to look for a simpler solution that retains most properties of the usual
ranking in round-robin tournaments. Contrarily, the majority of forecasting models do
not guarantee these axioms. Our proposal is based exclusively on the number of points as
well as the structure of the matches already played, and has the following advantages:
∙ It takes into consideration all results from the unfinished season;
∙ It accounts for the different number of matches played as well as for the fact that
the teams played against different sets of opponents with varying strengths;
∙ It does not depend on the form, home-away pattern, injuries, or results in the
preceding season(s);
∙ It seldom requires further tie-breaking criteria (Csató, 2017);
∙ It is suitable for any sport and does not call for the estimation of any parameter;
∙ It has a recursive formula where the first iteration still yields an adequate solution,
consequently, it requires no specific software, and the ranking can be computed
essentially by hand.
On the other hand, it should be acknowledged that no reasonable prediction is provided
for the final number of points. In our opinion, that is not a serious problem as only the
ranking of the teams are used to decide promotion, relegation, and qualification to other
tournaments.
The current paper is not the first attempt to produce a final ranking in these incomplete
tournaments. For example, the French mathematician Julien Guyon has suggested an Elobased method in the mainstream media (Guyon, 2020a,b), while Lambers and Spieksma
(2020) have applied an eigenvector-based approach. Hence the main scientific novelty is
provided by our axiomatic discussion, which has never been used before in this particular
topic, although Vaziri et al. (2018) have considered theoretical properties guaranteeing the
fairness and comprehensiveness of sports ranking methods, and the social literature has
extensively discussed similar issues (Chebotarev and Shamis, 1997, 1998; González-Dı́az
et al., 2014; Kitti, 2016; Rubinstein, 1980; Slutzki and Volij, 2005, 2006).
The rest of the article proceeds as follows. Section 2 studies some properties of the
usual ranking in round-robin tournaments and discusses their relevance when all matches
cannot be played. The generalized row sum method is introduced in Section 3 and shown
to be compatible with the desired axioms. Section 4 contains its application for six major
European soccer leagues. Section 5 summarises policy implications, while Section 6 offers
concluding remarks.

Axioms

As the first step, we present some conditions that are satisfied by the ranking from the
number of points in a round-robin tournament. This collection aims to assess whether they
can be guaranteed if the league cannot resume after some matches are played. Similarly
to Vaziri et al. (2018), precise mathematical formalization is avoided in order to be more
accessible for the general audience.

3

Axiom 1. Independence of irrelevant matches: The relative ranking of two teams should
be independent of any matches between the other teams.
Obviously, the number of points scored by any team does not depend on the results
of other teams. However, if head-to-head results are used for tie-breaking, this property
does not necessarily hold. Berker (2014) provides an extensive analysis of tie-breaking in
round-robin soccer tournaments.
Axiom 2. Self-consistency: Two teams should have the same rank if they achieved the
same results against teams having the same strength. Furthermore, a team should be
ranked strictly higher than another team if one of the following conditions hold:
∙ it achieved better, i.e. strictly dominant results against opponents having the
same strength;
∙ it achieved the same results against stronger opponents;
∙ it achieved better, i.e. strictly dominant results against stronger opponents.
Having better results implies a higher score, thus the ranking from the number of
points satisfies the first and the third requirements of self-consistency. Consider two teams
𝑖 and 𝑗. Assume for contradiction that team 𝑖 has the same results against stronger
opponents compared to team 𝑗 but team 𝑖 is ranked weakly below team 𝑗. In a round-robin
tournament, their set of opponents almost coincide but team 𝑖 is an opponent of team 𝑗
and vice versa. Consequently, the initial assumption cannot hold because team 𝑖 faced
stronger opponents than team 𝑗.
If the tournament is not round-robin, then there exists no ranking method simultaneously satisfying independence of irrelevant matches and self-consistency (Csató, 2019,
Theorem 1). The impossibility result holds under various domain restrictions. Selfconsistency is a more important property than independence of irrelevant matches, the
latter should be weakened to retain possibility (Csató, 2019).
Axiom 3. Invariance to cycles: Assume that team 𝑖 defeated team 𝑗, team 𝑗 defeated
team 𝑘, and team 𝑘 defeated team 𝑗. The ranking should be independent of reversing
these results such that team 𝑗 wins against team 𝑖, team 𝑘 wins against team 𝑗, and team
𝑖 wins against team 𝑘.
Such cycles are responsible for the basic challenges of ranking. While they certainly
cannot be deleted, it would be unjustified to modify the ranking after reversing their
direction. Most statistical methods are unlikely to guarantee invariance to cycles.
Axiom 4. Home-away independence: The ranking of the teams should not change if the
field of all matches is reversed.
The number of points does not take into account whether a game is played at home or
away (tie-breaking rules in some leagues do). It is a natural requirement in a round-robin
tournament where the teams usually play once at home and once away, however, this
home-away balance does not hold if the league is suspended. For example, Rennes, the
third team in the 2019/20 French Ligue 1 after 28 rounds, played only at home against
the dominating team Paris Saint-Germain, while the fourth Lille lost against Paris SaintGermain both at home and away. On the other hand, Rennes would have to play five, and
Lille would have to play six games away in the remaining 10 rounds.
4

There are at least two arguments for home-away independence even in incomplete
round-robin tournaments. First, according to our knowledge, this feature is not taken into
account in any European soccer league even though it would make sense in certain formats.
In the 2019/20 season, the leagues in Hungary and Kosovo are organized with 12 teams
playing a triple round-robin tournament, hence some teams play against others twice at
home and once away, or vice versa. In addition, certain teams play one match less at home
than other teams. The same format was used in Finland until 2018. In Northern Ireland
and Scotland, the 12 teams play a triple round-robin tournament in the initial stage. After
33 games, the league is split into two sections of six teams each such that every team plays
once more all the five teams in their section. Consequently, it is impossible to balance
the home-away pattern by guaranteeing that each club plays twice at home and twice
away against any other club in its section. While these unbalanced schedules generate
interesting research problems, for example, concerning the measurement of competitive
balance (Lenten, 2008), the number of points—and further tie-breaking rules—are not
adjusted for the inherent inequality.
Second, accounting for home advantage requires a statistical estimation of at least one
parameter, which will certainly result in debates around the exact methodology and the
sample used. As the above examples illustrate, it is improbable that the decision-makers
want to instigate such controversies.
Axiom 5. Consistency: The ranking should approach the ranking from the number of
points as the number of rounds played increases. In particular, they should coincide when
the competition is finished.
Consistency is perhaps the most essential property of ranking the teams in a suspended
league. The number of points has no competitive alternative in the real-world. It is
also important to use a procedure implying consistency due to its innate characteristics,
not merely because it is defined separately for incomplete and complete round-robin
tournaments.
To summarise, five properties of the common ranking method in round-robin tournaments have been presented. Independence of irrelevant matches cannot be expected to
hold if the league is suspended. Thus we are seeking a method satisfying self-consistency,
invariance to cycles, home-away independence, and consistency.

A reasonable family of ranking methods

Our proposal for ranking in incomplete round-robin tournaments requires two inputs: the
score vector p and the symmetric matches matrix M. In particular, 𝑝𝑖 is the number of
points for team 𝑖, whereas 𝑚𝑖𝑗 equals the number of matches between teams 𝑖 and 𝑗.
The methods are based on the normalized score vector s with its entries summing up
to zero. This is straightforward in sports where a win plus a loss is equivalent to two
draws since wins can be awarded by 𝛼 > 0, draws by zero, and losses by −𝛼 < 0. But
some sports do not follow this symmetric setting, mainly because of the three points rule,
which has become the standard in soccer: wins earn three points, draws earn one point,
and losses earn zero points. It has many deficiencies from a theoretical point of view, for
instance, reversing all results does not necessarily reverse the ranking and the number
of total points allocated depends not only on the number of matches played. But teams
should be definitely ranked even in these leagues.

Therefore, similarly to the quotient rule applied in the 2019/20 Handball-Bundesliga,
the average score per game is calculated for each team by dividing its number of points
with its number of matches played. These values are normalized such that the average
quotient is subtracted from the quotient of each team to obtain 𝑠𝑖 . Note that if two teams
𝑖, 𝑗 have played the same number of matches and 𝑝𝑖 = 𝑝𝑗 , then their normalized scores are
also equal, 𝑠𝑖 = 𝑠𝑗 .
Example 3.1. Eintracht Frankfurt has played 24 matches and scored 𝑝𝑖 = 28 points in the
2019/20 German Bundesliga until 13 March 2020. Therefore, it has scored 28/24 ≈ 1.167
points per game. The sum of these quotients for all the 18 teams is 25, thus the normalized
score of Eintracht Frankfurt is 𝑠𝑖 = 28/24 − 25/18 ≈ −0.222. Hertha BSC has also scored
28 points but over 25 matches, hence this club has a slightly lower normalized score of
−0.269.
Although normalisation of the scores considers the possibly different number of matches
played by the teams, it still does not reflect the strength of the opponents.
Example 3.2. Table 1 compares the teams against which Borussia Dortmund and RB
Leipzig should have played in the remaining nine rounds of the 2019/20 German Bundesliga.
Dortmund had clearly a more difficult schedule ahead than Leipzig as the points scored by
its future opponents in the previous rounds was higher by more than 11.7% (all of these
teams played 25 matches). However, Dortmund had a lead of one point over Leipzig. Is it
sufficient to rank Dortmund higher than Leipzig?
The strength of the schedule can be taken into account through the matches matrix
M. The matches already played can be represented by an undirected graph, where the
nodes correspond to the teams and the weight of any edge is determined by the number of
matches played by the associated teams. The Laplacian matrix L = [ℓ𝑖𝑗 ] of this graph is
defined such that ℓ𝑖𝑗 = −𝑚𝑖𝑗 for all 𝑖 ̸= 𝑗 and ℓ𝑖𝑖 is equal to the number of matches played
by team 𝑖. Furthermore, let I be the matrix with ones in the diagonal and zeros otherwise,
and e be the vector with 𝑒𝑖 = 1 for all 𝑖.
Definition 1. Generalized row sum: the generalized row sum rating vector x(𝜀) is given
by the unique solution of the system of linear equations
[I + 𝜀L] x(𝜀) = s,
6

where 𝜀 > 0 is a parameter.
The generalized row sum method was introduced in Chebotarev (1989) and Chebotarev
(1994). It adjusts the normalized scores by considering the performance of the opponents,
the opponents of the opponents, and so on. Parameter 𝜀 quantifies the degree of this
modification. The ranking induced by x(𝜀) converges to the ranking from the number of
points as 𝜀 → 0, hence the normalized score is a limit of generalized row sum. Uniqueness
comes from the fact that the matrix I + 𝜀L is invertible.
Definition 2. Least squares: the least squares rating vector q is given by the solution of
the system of linear equations e⊤ q = 0 and
Lq = s.
The least squares rating is unique if and only if any team can be compared with any
other team at least indirectly, through other teams. This is a natural constraint—otherwise,
there exist two subsets of the teams without any matches between the two sets. The
condition certainly holds if half of the season is finished, that is, each team has played all
other teams at least once. The method is called least squares since the above system of
linear equations can be obtained as the optimal solution of a least squared errors estimation
(González-Dı́az et al., 2014; Csató, 2015).
The least squares rating vector q can be calculated recursively unless graph 𝐺 is regular
bipartite (Csató, 2015, Theorem 2): q = lim𝑘→∞ q(𝑘) , where
q(0) = (1/𝑟)s,
q(𝑘) = q(𝑘−1) +

]︂𝑘

1 1
(𝑟I − L)
𝑟 𝑟
[︂

s

for all 𝑘 ≥ 1,

(1)

In formula (1), 𝑟 is the maximal number of matches played by a team. Consequently, the
entries of matrix 𝑟I − L contain the number of matches played by the associated teams,
assuming that a team has played against itself if it has played fewer matches than other
teams. Therefore, q(1) modifies the normalized scores due to the strength of the opponents,
q(2) accounts for the opponents of the opponents, and so on.
The ranking induced by x(𝜀) converges to the ranking from the least squares as 𝜀 → ∞,
hence the least squares is the other extremum of generalized row sum (Chebotarev and
Shamis, 1998, p. 326). The sum of points scored by the opponents is called the Buchholz
point in chess and used as a tie-breaking criterion, justifying the alternative name recursive
Buchholz (Brozos-Vázquez et al., 2010).
Proposition 1. The generalized row sum and least squares rankings satisfy self-consistency,
invariance to cycles, home-away independence, and consistency.
Proof. Chebotarev and Shamis (1998, Theorem 5) proves self-consistency.
Invariance to cycles holds because reversing all results along a cycle does not affect the
score vector p.
Home-away independence is guaranteed by disregarding the field of the game in the score
vector p and the matches matrix M.
Consistency is verified for the generalized row sum by Chebotarev (1994, Property 3) and
for the least squares by González-Dı́az et al. (2014, Proposition 5.3).

In addition, these rankings are independent of the particular value 𝛼 for wins in sports
using a symmetric scoring rule. Similarly, the result is the same for the 3-1-0, 6-2-0, and
4-2-1 point systems, in other words, the rewards can be shifted and multiplied arbitrarily.
The generalized row sum and especially the least squares methods have several successful
applications, including, among others, (a) international price comparisons by the Eurostat
and OECD, where the least squares procedure is called the EKS (Éltető-Köves-Szulc)
method (European Union / OECD, 2012); (b) evaluating movies (Jiang et al., 2011); (c)
deriving alternative quality of life indices (Petróczy, 2018, 2019, 2020); (d) ranking the
participants of the Eurovision Song Contest (Čaklović and Kurdija, 2017); (e) ranking
universities on the basis of applicants’ preferences (Csató and Tóth, 2020); (f) ranking
historical go (Chao et al., 2018) and tennis players (Bozóki et al., 2016); and (g) ranking
teams in Swiss-system chess tournaments (Csató, 2017). Further details on their theoretical
properties can be found in Chebotarev (1994), Shamis (1994), and González-Dı́az et al.
(2014).

Application: ranking in the 2019/20 season of six
major European soccer leagues

The five major premier European soccer leagues have been chosen to illustrate how this
parametric family of ranking methods work, together with the league in the Netherlands,
which has been declared void on 25 April 2020. All of them have been suspended in March
2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, when about 70-75% of the matches in the 2019/20
season have already been played:
∙ The Premier League in England with 20 teams, 29 rounds finished except for four
clubs, which have played only 28 games;
∙ The Ligue 1 in France with 20 teams, 28 rounds finished except for the game
Strasbourg vs. Paris Saint-Germain;
∙ The Bundesliga in Germany with 18 teams, 25 rounds finished except for the
game Werder Bremen vs. Eintracht Frankfurt;
∙ The Seria A in Italy with 20 teams, 26 rounds finished except for eight clubs,
which have played only 25 games;
∙ The Eredivisie in the Netherlands with 18 teams, 26 rounds finished except for
four clubs, which have played only 25 games;
∙ The La Liga in Spain with 20 teams, 27 rounds finished.
Tables 2 and 3 report the current number of points for each team, their rankings by the
generalized row sum method with two values of 𝜀, as well as by the least squares method.
In the case of the smallest parameter, 𝜀 = 0.001, the strength of opponents serves only to
break the ties in the normalized scores.
The first and most crucial observation is the robustness of the rankings. This stands
in stark contract to Swiss-system chess team tournaments, where accounting for the
opponents can substantially affect the ranking, particularly for the middle teams (Csató,
2017). The probable reason is the large number of matches already played. It is a favorable

finding, which indicates that freezing the current standing—with the tie-breaking rules
according to Tables 2 and 3—or using the quotient rule (normalized scores) would be a
relatively fair solution.
The ideal case is represented by Spain: if the ties in the number of points are resolved
through the strength of opponents (𝜀 → 0), then the ranking does not depend on the
weight of the adjustment at all. There is no need to consider the number of matches played
in La Liga. Compared to the ranking induced by the number of points, the only change
is on the fourth position as officially Real Sociedad overtakes Getafe due to more goals
scored, but the latter team has faced stronger opponents. This difference has fundamental
sporting effects since the fourth club automatically qualifies for the group stage of the
UEFA Champions League, and the fifth goes only to the UEFA Europa League.
While some top clubs in the Netherlands have played fewer matches, this does not
influence the usual ranking with goal difference as the tie-breaking rule. Crucially, the
parameter responsible for adjusting the normalized scores due to the strength of the
opponents does not change the ranking except for certain middle teams, which has not
much sporting effect. This is important because Ajax Amsterdam—the team having
the most (56) points in a tie with AZ Alkmaar, favoured by its goal difference—has not
been declared the champion but it has obtained the only slot for the Netherlands in the

group stage of the 2020/21 UEFA Champions League, while the second club has entered
the second qualifying round, therefore it should win three clashes to reach the group
stage. Note that AZ is preferred to Ajax by the eigenvector-based method of Lambers and
Spieksma (2020).
Similarly, the value of 𝜀 barely affects the ranking in Italy. Disregarding tie-breaking,
the changes are on the 10th and the 14th positions, which are almost insignificant because
they influence neither qualification for European cups nor relegation. On the other hand,
the seventh place—which provides a slot in the second qualifying round of the UEFA
Europa League—should be given to one of the teams that scored 35 points, Hellas Verona or
Parma as the additional match played by Milan is seemingly responsible for its advantage
of one point. Although Parma has worse goal difference, this club has faced stronger
opponents than Hellas Verona.
The situation in the Premier League is analogous to Serie A. While Arsenal has one
point less (40) compared to Tottenham Hotspur, this is compensated by the fewer number
of games played for small values of 𝜀. The generalized row sum method also exchanges
Brighton & Hove Albion with West Ham United on the insignificant 15th place.
Turning to the Bundesliga, the 13th place has minimal sporting effects. The seventh
team qualifies for the second qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League because the
10

cup winner, Bayern Munich, is one of the first six clubs. Furthermore, as Example 3.2 has
explained, RB Leipzig can be the runner-up instead of Borussia Dortmund if the strength
of the opponents receives a considerable role in the ranking, that is, for large values of
𝜀. Nonetheless, both the second- and the third-placed clubs enter the group stage of the
UEFA Champions League.
The ranking in Ligue 1—a league which has never been finished—is perhaps the most
challenging. Since Paris Saint-Germain (first with 68 points) has won both the domestic
cup and the French league cup competition, the third-placed club qualifies for the third
qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League in the league path, the fourth- and the
fifth-placed clubs go to the group stage of the UEFA Europa League, and the sixth-placed
club receives a slot in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League. If the
strength of the opponents takes a large weight, then Lille with 49 points is ranked above
Rennes with 50 points and obtains the Champions League slot, while Montpellier with
40 points is ranked above Nice with 41 points and goes to the Europa League. The issue
of Rennes and Lille has been highlighted in Guyon (2020a): Lille played and lost twice
against the dominating Paris Saint-Germain while Rennes faced it once, and the number
of points scored so far by their future opponents is 347 for Lille but 379 for Rennes (and
even 381 or 382 if accounting for the missing clash Strasbourg vs. Paris Saint-Germain
from the 29th round).
Finally, recall that the least squares rating vector can be computed recursively according
to formula (1). Accounting for the strength of direct opponents, that is, vector q(1) almost
always induces the same ranking as the final rating vector q, the only exception being
that Lyon with 40 points in Ligue 1 is ranked above Angers having 39 points only after
considering the opponents of opponents (in addition, the ranking according to q(2) is
different from the ranking induced by q(1) , q(3) , and q in the 2019/20 Premier League).
In our examples, primarily the direct impact of the opponents count. Consequently, it is
not necessary to calculate the inverse of any matrix, and one matrix multiplication can be
sufficient to determine a fair ranking.

Policy implications

Ranking in a suspended round-robin league is non-trivial because of the need to account
for schedule imbalances and possibly for the different number of matches played by the
teams. The second issue is considered in the quotient rule but that relatively often results
in ties (Web24 News, 2020) and does not reflect the strength of opponents.
Even though it is difficult to argue for any particular value of 𝜀, we think it is best to
give the largest possible weight to the role of opponents. At least, there is some evidence
for supporting the least squares ranking in Swiss-system chess team tournaments (Csató,
2017). Since this procedure does not contain a parameter, it would be a better alternative
than the generalized row sum, which may lead to such disputes.
Therefore it is recommended to choose from the following solutions, listed in decreasing
order of complexity and preference:
1. Least squares method;
2. Generalized row sum method with a small 𝜀 that breaks only the ties remaining
in the normalized scores;

11

3. Quotient rule (points per game) with the tie-breaking criteria of goal difference,
goals scored;
4. Number of points with the tie-breaking criteria of fewer matches played, goal
difference, goals scored.

Conclusions

The problem of ranking the teams in an incomplete round-robin tournament has been
discussed. We have taken an axiomatic approach to identify the key properties of real-world
rankings. A family of ranking methods has been shown to satisfy the desired requirements.
It has been applied for the 2019/20 season of six major European soccer leagues that were
suspended after the outbreak of coronavirus.
Accounting for the strength of opponents turns out to be necessary for incomplete
tournaments. This factor can be considered only by introducing an additional parameter.
However, its value has only marginal influence in all leagues considered here as the set
of clubs to be relegated is entirely independent of this choice, and qualification to the
European cups is barely influenced.
The adjustment of the standard scores is carried out in two steps: the correction for the
number of matches played (normalized score) is followed by accounting for the strength of
the opponents. This provides a simple, robust, and scientifically well-established way to
obtain a fair final standing in a round-robin league that cannot resume.
Naturally, ranking in a sports league is a zero-sum game, thus any solution will prefer
certain teams compared to an alternative regime. Future rulebooks should explicitly define
what happens if a league has to be finished without playing all matches. Our paper can
contribute to single out a suitable policy for this purpose.
