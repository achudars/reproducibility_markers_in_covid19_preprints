Abstract Nowadays, the epidemic of COVID-19 in China is under control. However, the epidemic are developing rapidly around the world. Due to the normal migration of population, China is facing high risk from
imported cases. The potential specific medicine and vaccine is still in the process of clinical trials. Currently,
controlling the impact of imported cases is the key to prevent new outbreak of COVID-19 in China. In this
paper, we propose two impulsive systems to describe the impact of multilateral imported cases of COVID-19.
Based on the published data, we simulate and discussed the epidemic trends under different control strategies.
We compare four different scenarios and show the corresponding medical burden. The results help to design
appropriate control strategy for imported cases in practice.

Introduction

At the beginning of 2020, a horrible infectious disease spread rapidly throughout China. The strong
ability of transmission and high fatality ratio have attracted attention worldwide. WHO named the
infectious disease as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is the seventh member of coronavirus
which can infect human [16,19]. Compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 has a significant but volatile incubation period, a much
stronger transmission ability and a relative low fatality ratio [6]. Another key factor of COVID-19 is
asymptomatic transmission, it is reported [8] that the proportion of asymptomatic infected people could
be up to 60% and it brings high risk for new outbreak. As of April 3, over 1 million confirmed cases were
reported in more than 200 countries, areas or territories around the world [16].
The Chinese government has conducted a series strategies to prevent the spread of the disease, such
as regional restrictions, home quarantine, isolating close contacts, extend vacation and postpone the resumption of work, these strategies are aiming at protecting the suspectable population [11]. All provinces
of China promptly launched Level-1 response to major public health emergencies and established designated hospitals, mobile cabin hospitals and fever outpatient departments to provide adequate medical

support. Clinical studies showed that the disease is susceptible to all people, even worse, there is no
specific medicine and vaccines. In order to ensure every patient to be treated, the Chinese government
provide free medical care for domestic confirmed COVID-19 patients. In China, COVID-19 has been
being under control by the strict measures since the end of February and the trend of the epidemic are
becoming steady.
Although the number of cumulative infectious case nearly reached peak and the outbreak of the epidemic in China has been relieved greatly, the sporadic importations continue to affect the epidemic
process. COVID-19 is now raging most region of the world. On March 17 [16], the total confirmed
COVID-19 cases nearly reaches 100 thousands. Especially, Italy, Iran and Spain are all reported more
than 10 thousands cases. Some of theses countries take similar measures with China to control the disease
actively. Due to the international migration, the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 still threaten China.
How to keep up our costly achievement is the most important topic for the epidemic control. In next
control stage, we will focus on the management and controlling of cases imported from foreign countries.
Extensive researches for COVID-19 with multiple points of view has been reported. These researches
make people understand COVID-19 better. The study of clinical observation and management of COVID19 patients will be the guideline of practical treatment [1,4,6]. The development of specific medicine and
vaccines is mainly depended on virological research [12, 17, 20]. Further more, most people want to know
the trend and scale of the disease. Appropriate prediction will help people avoid more loss and make
effective control strategy [13‚Äì15, 18].
We incorporate impulsive terms into differential equations to simulate the process of migration from
other countries. We discuss several different control strategies under different scenarios and estimate the
accumulated medical resource for each procedure. Currently, most of provinces in China are resuming
to work, we analyze the impact of imported cases with and without the domestic cases cleared under
the different quarantine strategies. It shows that the imported cases would produce new outbreak of the
epidemic if the domestic infected cases were not clear. After clearing that, the increasing trend due to
the imported cases can be suppressed under strict immigration control strategy. The numerical results
also show that limitation of international arrivals, the strategy carrying in China, is an effective way to
reduce the amount of confirmed cases and also the medical resources needed.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We propose the impulsive models in Section 2 and
present the numerical results in Section 3. Finally, we present some concluding remarks in Section 4.
Some supplementary materials are shown in Appendix.

Model Formulation

In this section, we formulate the epidemic model in an impulsive way to describe multilateral immigration.
The epidemic of COVID-19 is under control in most provinces in China, some provinces have been
preparing for resumption of work orderly. The complete recovery of production and normal daily life is
coming soon. Based on our previous work in [9] and [10], we propose two models to describe the impact
of imported cases with and without the original quarantine strategy applied. The models satisfy the
following assumptions.
(1) All coefficients involved in the models are positive constants, Z+ represents the set of positive
integer.
(2) Natural birth and death are not taken into account.
(3) Once the infected patient is cured, the immune efficacy will maintain for some time, i.e., second
infection is not considered in the model.
The flow diagrams (Figure 1 and 2) present the control strategy. Solid and dashed lines represent the
continuous and the impulsive importing procedures, respectively. The corresponding dynamical systems

(2.2)

Where S(t), Q(t)(Qi (t)), E(t), A(t), I(t), D(t) and R(t) denotes the susceptible, quarantined, exposed,
asymptomatically infected, symptomatically infected, diagnosed and recovered population at time t,
respectively. Compartment E(t) represents low-level virus carriers, which are considered to be no infectiousness. We assume that the individuals in compartment D(t) are being treated and isolated. In Model
(2.1), the home quarantine strategy keeps carrying on, we use parameter p and Œª to represent the quarantined rate and release rate. Compartment Q(t) in Model (2.1) contains not only the imported exposed
population E i , but also the domestic quarantined individuals who are carrying no virus, so we use an
impulsive procedure to describe the transition of E i to D(t) for Model (2.1). œâ denotes the proportion
of becoming diagnosed from the imported exposed population E i in Model (2.1) during the isolation
period. Model (2.2) describes the scenario after the resumption of work, all of the domestic population
in China return back to their normal life, then the compartment Qi (t) includes the isolated imported
population only. We use a continuous transition procedure and denote by parameter Qi the diagnostic
rate of imported exposed population in the model. Both Q(t) and Qi (t) have no contact with the infected
individuals, that is, the population in Q(t) and Qi (t) will not cause new infection. However, there are

5

some exposed individuals in them due to the overseas imported cases, which we cannot detect them
immediately after arrival. S i , E i , Ai and I i are constants which denote the population of corresponding
compartments from the imported population, the period is denoted as T .
Model (2.1) and (2.2) share 11 parameters, we refer the definition of these parameters in [9]. We use
parameter Œ≤ to denote the contact rate and Œ∏ ‚àà (0, 1) to denote the ratio between the infection rates of
the individuals with and without symptoms. œÉ denotes the transition rate of exposed to infected class.
After someone infected, the proportion of becoming symptomatic is denoted by œÅ and asymptomatic by
1 ‚àí œÅ. Diagnostic rate of asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious are respectively denoted by A and
I and the mean recovery period of class A, I, D are denoted by 1/Œ≥A , 1/Œ≥I and 1/Œ≥D , respectively. The
parameters dI and dD represent the disease-induced death rate.
For the two models established in this paper, overseas cases import into China periodically. The
continuous input will make D(t) > 0 at any time. We define this state as fake diseases-free status.
With meticulous isolation and control, it may not cause new local infected. However, it requires strict
immigration policy and must pay more attention to avoid nosocomial infection. The medical burden of
COVID-19 will be lasting long. Once infected individuals come into our normal social life, it might cause
a more serious new outbreak which we show it in Section 3. The epidemic vanishes only if there are no
imported cases. The world is a community of common destiny for all mankind, therefore, China must
prepare for long-term actions on the prevention of COVID-19 imported cases.

Numerical Simulations

According to the severity of the epidemic around the world and the closeness of personal exchange with
China, we take Italy, Iran, Spain, Germany and France - the five countries with the most sever COVID19 outbreaks, South Korea and Japan - the two neighboring countries, into account ( [16], the data
updated to March 17, 2020). We select 16 provinces in China, which have the relatively large numbers
of imported population from these countries. We simulate the impact of the imported population from
these seven countries. The control strategy is changing with the process of epidemic, we forecast the
trends of COVID-19 under different scenarios.
3.1

Estimation of the Imported Population

The sources of imported population is relatively fixed. Based on the international flight schedule published
by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) [3] and the ship information on China Ship Ticketing
Website [2], we obtained the departure, destination, the weekly flights and ships information. Combining
with the epidemic data of COVID-19 published by WHO [16], we estimate the population imported from
different airports and ports of the selected seven countries, also the arrivals of different compartments.
Table 3 and 4 in Appendix show the detailed imported population and the estimated proportion of
different compartments from different airports and ports are in Table 1. Airport codes are defined by
International Air Transport Association (IATA) [7], port codes are according to the China National
Standard GB/T 7407-2015 [5]. From Table 3 and 4, we can obtain the periodical impulsive population
S i , E i , Ai , I i for simulation, we assume the impulsive period T = 3 days.
3.2

Accumulated Medical Resource

We discussed the long-term problem of medical burden which China has to face in Section 2. In this
section, we introduce an index to estimate the medical burden, which reflects the prevalence of COVID-19
and helps to make design for the allocation of health care resources. Following the procedure in [9], we
integrate D(t) in [t0 , t1 ] to represent AM R in this period.

AM R = r

China, there are still a few domestic infected cases, we assume that all the domestic exposed and infected
cases will be cleaned up before Apr 22, it means E(t), A(t) and I(t) will be keeping 0 after that day. We
apply the model in [9] to simulate the no imported scenario and the first 30 days of above four scenarios.
We combine Model (2.1) for the next 90 days to finish the simulation for Scenario A. We use Model (2.1)
for second 30 days and Model (2.2) for the following 60 days with condition E(t) + A(t) + I(t) 6= 0 to
describe Scenario B. For Scenario C, we use the combination of 60 days for Model (2.1) and 30 days for
Model (2.2) to simulate Scenario C with condition E(t) + A(t) + I(t) = 0. On Mar 26, CAAC announced
that each domestic airline can keep only one route to each country and each route cannot operate more
than one shift per week, each foreign airline can keep only one route to China and the weekly operation
shift cannot exceed one [3]. This strategy caused a sharply drop of international flights from 1447 to
131 shifts per week. Scenario D describes the impact of this strategy with dropping 90% of impulsive
imported population. We refer the parameters estimated in [9] for simulation (see Table 5).
We summarize the results in Figure 4, we can clearly see that, if the home quarantine strategy is
keeping (Scenario A), the impact of imported cases is limited, D(t) will stay at a relatively low level
in most selected provinces. But for high imported regions, such as Beijing, Liaoning and Shanghai, the
medical burden is heavy and enduring. Notice that, if the domestic infected cases hasn‚Äôt been cleared, it
is very dangerous to resume to work and may cause new outbreak in each selected province. In Scenario
C and D, we choose the beginning day on April 22, 2020. According to daily report, we assume that
from that day, the infected population is vanished. At that time, local people return to their normal
life and the imported population will be isolation for at least 14 days. We show different imported risk
simulation. Under this strategy, for most provinces, the control effect is acceptable. But in high imported
risk regions, the medical resources are still strained. Especially in Shanghai, the peak value of D(t) is
much higher than the previous outbreak. We also calculate the increment of AM R for C and D scenarios,
see Table 2. Since the Chinese government has pushed the tightened immigration policy, it will decrease
D(t) compared with normal immigration policy. And the corresponding medical burden is also decreased.
Notice that, many imported individuals need two or more transfer to get their destination. Due to
the strong transmission ability of COVID-19, the transportation of imported population may cause new
local infections. Considering Scenario B, if local people are infected by the imported cases and we don‚Äôt
keep home quarantine strategy, the potential outbreak inside China will be much horrible. To avoid this,
it is suggested that, nucleic acid testing should be applied to each imported individuals and isolating the
imported population immediately without any more domestic transfer.

Conclusions

In this paper, we establish two epidemic models with pulse to describe imported population from other
countries. Under different control strategies, the trends and medical burden of COVID-19 are given. If
we keep home quarantine, the impact is limited. After people go back to normal life, strict immigration
control is pre-requisite and domestic infected population must be vanished. Otherwise, the scale of the

9

new outbreak will be even worse. Once the domestic infected population is clear, isolation for imported
population only is acceptable. But some high imported risk provinces must prepare for long-term control
measures. The imported COVID-19 cases will require high medical investment for a long time.
