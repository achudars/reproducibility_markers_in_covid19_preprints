Abstract—We report on measurements of Bluetooth Low Energy
(LE) received signal strength taken on mobile handsets in a
variety of common, real-world settings. We note that a key
difficulty is obtaining the ground truth as to when people are in
close proximity to one another. Knowledge of this ground truth
is important for accurately evaluating the accuracy with which
contact events are detected by Bluetooth LE. We approach this
by adopting a scenario-based approach. In summary, we find that
the Bluetooth LE received signal strength can vary substantially
depending on the relative orientation of handsets, on absorption
by the human body, reflection/absorption of radio signals in
buildings and trains. Indeed we observe that the received signal
strength need not decrease with increasing distance. This suggests
that the development of accurate methods for proximity detection
based on Bluetooth LE received signal strength is likely to be
challenging. Our measurements also suggest that combining use
of Bluetooth LE contact tracing apps with adoption of new
social protocols may yield benefits but this requires further
investigation. For example, placing phones on the table during
meetings is likely to simplify proximity detection using received
signal strength. Similarly, carrying handbags with phones placed
close to the outside surface. In locations where the complexity
of signal propagation makes proximity detection using received
signal strength problematic entry/exit from the location might
instead be logged in an app by e.g. scanning a time-varying QR
code or the like.

I. I NTRODUCTION
There is currently a great deal of interest in the use of mobile
apps to facilitate Covid-19 contact tracing. This is motivated
by the hope that more efficient and scalable contact tracing
might allow the lockdown measures currently in place in many
countries to be relaxed more quickly [1].
In this report we take a first step in evaluating the potential for using Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) received signal
strength to detect periods of close contact between people. We
present measurements taken on mobile handsets in a variety
of common, real-world settings. We also measure the effect
on received signal strength caused by the human body, by
different types of indoor wall, the relative orientation of mobile
handsets and so on.
The basic idea of a contact tracing app is that if two people
carrying mobile handsets installed with the app spend significant time in close proximity to one another (e.g. spending 15

minutes within 2 metres1 ) then the apps on their handsets will
both record this contact event. If, subsequently, one of these
people is diagnosed with Covid-19 then the contact events
logged on that person’s handset in the recent past, e.g. over
the last two weeks, are used to identify people who have been
in close contact with the infected person. These people might
then be made aware of the contact and advised to self-isolate
or take other appropriate precautions. For this approach to be
effective it is, of course, necessary that the app can accurately
detect contact events.
Almost all modern handsets are equipped with Bluetooth LE
wireless technology and there is currently much interest in
using this as the means for detecting contact events. The
Singapore TraceTogether contact tracing app [2], [3], [4] is
perhaps the first widely used app that uses Bluetooth LE for
detecting contact events. More recently, Apple and Google
have formed a partnership to develop contact event detection
based on Bluetooth LE [5].
TraceTogether uses the Bluetooth LE received signal strength
to estimate proximity, and likely the Apple/Google API will
do the same. In general, a radio signal tends to get weaker as
it gets further from the transmitter since the transmit power
is spread over a greater area. Bluetooth LE devices can be
configured to transmit beacons at regular intervals and the
idea is that the signal strength with which a beacon is received
provides a rough measure of the distance between transmitter
and receiver. Namely, when the received signal strength is
sufficiently high then this may indicate a contact event and,
conversely, when the received signal strength is sufficiently
low then this may indicate that the handsets are not in close
proximity.
However, the propagation of radio signals in practice is
often complex, especially in indoor environments where walls,
floors, ceiling, furniture etc can absorb/reflect radio waves and
so change the received signal strength. A person’s body also
absorbs Bluetooth LE radio signals so that the received signal
1 Ideally, what counts as a contact event should be informed by the
conditions under which the virus is actually spread e.g. perhaps there is
less risk of infection when people are 1m apart but facing away rather than
towards each other, or perhaps contact with surfaces is more important than
transmission through the air. However data to inform more refined definitions
of a contact event currently seems to be lacking.

strength can be substantially reduced if their body lies on the
path between the transmitter and receiver.

radio signals and so leakage of these signals between adjacent
houses/buildings is likely to be small.

With this in mind, we report here on measurements of Bluetooth LE received signal strength taken on mobile handsets
in a variety of common, real-world settings. A key difficulty
in evaluating proximity detection accuracy in real-world settings is establishing ground truth i.e. recording when contact
events actually happened. This ground truth is needed so that
the contact events flagged by a contact tracing app can be
compared against the actual contact events and so allow the
accuracy of the app at detecting contact events to be assessed.
To address this we generally adopt a scenario-based approach.
For example, we take measurements as two people walk a
circuit in city streets side by side while maintaining a 1
metre distance between them. This has the great advantage
that (i) ground truth is clear (to within experimental error,
e.g. people will not be able to maintain an exactly 1 metre
distance while walking) and (ii) data is collected in real-world
settings with all their associated complexity. The disadvantage
of course is that this limits our study to fairly simple, well
structured scenarios. However, by selecting scenarios that aim
to capture some of the key elements in common activities we
can still gain useful insight into the real-world performance of
Bluetooth LE received signal strength for proximity detection.

While we consider a much wider range of real-world scenarios
and our focus is on contact tracing, our observations are
consistent with previous measurement studies on the use of
Bluetooth for proximity detection for other purposes. For
example, [6], [7], [8], [9] in the context of measuring social
interaction and [10], [11], [12] in the context of indoor
localisation. These previous studies have generally found
simple thresholding of received signal strength to be highly
error prone and therefore found it necessary to use machine
learning methods trained on data collected from the particular
environment of interest in order to obtain accuate proximity
detection. These methods depend upon the availability of
ground truth data, and the ability of the developed methods to
generalise beyond the specific setting considered is not clear.

We present measurements for four real-world scenarios: people
walking outdoors in city streets, people sitting around a
meeting table, people sitting in a train carriage and people
grocery shopping in a supermarket. In addition we present
supporting measurements evaluating the impact of the relative
orientation of handsets on received signal strength, and on the
signal attenuation caused by the human body, by a woman’s
handbag and by different types of indoor wall.
In summary, we find that (i) the Bluetooth LE received
signal strength can vary substantially depending on the relative
orientation of handsets and on absorption by the human body.
This means that, for example, the received signal strength is
considerably higher when people are walking side by side
compared to when they walk one behind the other at the same
distance. Similarly, we find that when people are sitting around
a meeting table with their phones in their trouser pockets
the received signal strength is low even when the people are
sitting less than 1m apart. When they place their phones on
the table the received signal strength is much increased. We
also find that (ii) within complex indoor environments the
received signal strength need not decrease with distance and
indeed may increase with distance (recall that we generally
expect signal strength to decrease with increasing distance,
not to increase). For example, for two people walking around
a large supermarket we find that the received signal strength
is much the same when they walk close together and when
they walk 2m apart. We observe increases in signal strength
with increasing distance within a domestic house and within
a train carriage. On a more positive note we find that (iii)
outdoors the received signal strength indeed tends to decrease
with increasing distance thus facilitating proximity detection,
also that blockwork walls strongly attenuate Bluetooth LE

This suggests that the development of accurate methods for
proximity detection based on Bluetooth LE received signal
strength is likely to be challenging. Apps based on Bluetooth
LE are therefore probably not a panacea but rather are best
viewed as a potentially useful addition to existing contact
tracing methods. Our measurements also suggest that combining use of Bluetooth LE contact tracing apps with adoption
of new social protocols2 may yield benefits although this
requires further investigation. For example, placing phones
on the table during meetings is likely to simplify proximity
detection using received signal strength. Similarly, carrying
handbags with phones placed close to the outside surface. In
locations where the complexity of signal propagation makes
proximity detection using received signal strength problematic,
one might consider logging entry to/exit from the area in an
app. This would allow the Bluetooth data collected in that area
to be flagged as being less reliable, hopefully reducing the
rate of contact tracing errors. Logging of entry/edit might, for
example, be achieved by scanning a time-varying QR code,
tapping a handset on a near-field tag (similar to contactless
payment) or by placing a dedicated Bluetooth beaconing
device at the entry/exit point whose beacons can be logged3 .
II. B RIEF OVERVIEW OF B LUETOOTH LE
Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) was standardised in 2010. The
low energy moniker refers to the reduced drain on the device
battery compared to the older Bluetooth Classic technology.
The first mobile handsets using Bluetooth LE appeared in
2011-12 (e.g. the iPhone 4S) and today almost all modern
handsets come equipped with it.
2 Such social protocols should, however, not be used to effectively make it
mandatory for people to carry a handset with a contact tracing app installed,
e.g. employers should generally not make this mandatory for all employees.
3 Such entry/exit logging is compatible with existing decentralised contact
tracing architectures. Namely, a record of the codes associated with these
entry/exit events plus the times when they occurred could be stored locally
on a user’s handset. Upon a person being discovered to be infected their
recorded codes could be uploaded and other people can check these against
their own locally stored record. The codes used should be changed fairly
frequently to avoid linking of codes with locations. Entry/exit logging may,
however, require modification of app APIs

3

Bluetooth LE operates in the same 2.4GHz unlicensed radio
band as WiFi and other devices (including microwave ovens).
Bluetooth LE devices advertise their presence by periodically
(typically once per second) broadcasting short beacon messages. To mitigate the effects of interference from other users
of the 2.4GHz band each beacon is broadcast simultaneously
on three widely spaced radio channels.
Each beacon essentially consists of a short fixed preamble,
followed by a small beacon payload. The payload contains an
identifier of the device making the boadcast (in modern devices
this identifier is usually randomised and changes frequently to
improve privacy) plus a short message (generally up to 31
bytes long). This message is typically used to indicate that
the beacon is associated with a particular app or service, e.g.
to associate it with a contact tracing app.
A device equipped with a Bluetooth LE receiver scans the
three beacon radio channels listening for beacon transmissions.
When the start of a transmission is detected the receiver uses
the fact that the beacon preamble is fixed and known to fine
tune the radio receiver to the incoming signal. As part of
this fine tuning process a received signal strength indicator
(RSSI) is output, which is an estimate of the radio power in the
received signal. It is worth noting that this RSSI measurement
is intrinsically noisy, with fluctuations of ±5dB or greater
common even in situations with simple line-of-sight radio
transmission, e.g. see [10] and Figure 1 below. If the received
signal strength is too weak either the transmission is simply not
noticed or this fine-tuning process fails. Typically this occurs
when the received signal strength is below around -90dB (the
noise floor of the receiver). Upon successful fine-tuning of the
receiver the payload of the beacon is decoded and passed up
to the operating system and then on to relevant apps.
The received signal strength is affected by the transmit power
used by the device broadcasting the beacon. Bluetooth LE
devices generally use a relatively low transmit power (to save
on battery drain) and a rough guideline is that beacons cannot
be decoded at distances beyond about 10 metres from the
transmitter. In practice the received signal strength is, however,
also greatly affected by the way in which the radio signal
propagates from transmitter to receiver. In general the radio
signal gets weaker as it travels further since the transmit
power is spread over a greater area. However, many complex
effects can be superimposed upon this basic behaviour. In
particular, obstacles lying on the path between the transmitter
and receiver (furniture, walls etc) can absorb and/or reflect the
radio signal and cause it to be received with higher or lower
signal strength. A person’s body also absorbs radio signals
in the 2.4 GHz band and so the received signal strength can
be substantially reduced if their body lies on the path between
the transmitter and receiver. In indoor enviroment walls, floors
and ceilings can reflect radio signals even when they are not
on the direct path between transmitter and receiver, and so
increase or decrease the received signal strength.
Metal, in particular, strongly reflects radio waves and this can
be an important factor in radio propagation in environments
with a lot of metal. In buses and trains the walls, floor and

ceiling are mainly metal and the seats often contain metal
parts. In supermarkets not only are the shelving, fridges and
freezers typically made of metal but also tinned groceries
etc located on the shelving. We can therefore expect that
radio propagation in these environments will be complex, and
in particular due to reflections the signal strength may not
decrease as quickly with distance as in other environments
e.g. see [13], [14].
III. BASELINE M EASUREMENTS
A. Hardware & Software Used
In our tests we used two pairs of mobile handsets: a pair
of Google Pixel 2’s and a pair of Samsung Galaxy A10’s,
both running Android 9. Since we only acquired the Galaxy
A10’s after our measurement study had already started most of
our measurements were made using the Pixel 2’s, and unless
otherwise stated the measurements that we report below are
Pixel 2 data.
We used the OpenTrace app [3] to collect measurements. This
is an open source version of the TraceTogether [4] contact tracing app used in Singapore. We slightly modified OpenTrace to
(i) dump the measured receive signal strength values to disk in
csv format and (ii) to scan/advertise Bluetooth beacons more
frequently (allowing us to collect data more quickly, albeit at
the cost of an increased drain on the handset battery which is
why these settings would not be used in a production contact
tracing app). Note that in our initial experiments we used the
default scan/advertise settings of OpenTrace, which yields a
receives signal strength measurement roughly every 10s. The
change (ii) above increases the sample rate to a measurement
roughly every second. We verified that this caused no other
change to the collected received signal strength values.

B. Signal Attenuation With Distance
To provide a baseline we collected measurements of received
signal strength vs distance. We placed two handsets at the
same height and collected measurements of received signal
strength as we varied the spacing between them. At each
distance the handsets are held in a fixed position for at least 10
minutes while the measurements are taken, giving around 80
signal strength observations (one for each advertised beacon
detected) at each distance. The handsets are placed flat with
the screen facing upwards (as we will see later the relative
orientation of the handsets can affect the received signal
strength).
The solid line in Figure 1(a) shows the measured received
signal strength vs distance for our pair of Google Pixel
2 handsets placed in an open space outdoors (the location
is shown in Figure 1(b)). It can be seen that the received
signal strength decreases steadily with increasing distance, as
expected. Also shown are error bars indicating one standard
deviation of the measured signal strength at each distance.
It can be seen that the standard deviation is around 5dB,

handset is moved from the open room into this narrower
space. We have also observed similar effects outdoors. Such
behaviour has obvious implications for the use of received
signal strength to measure proximity, and confirms that caution
is needed when interpreting received signal strength.

consistent with previous observations in the literature, e.g.
see [10].
Since the received signal strength depends on the transmit
power and antenna gain of the transmitter and also on the antenna gain at the receiver it can be expected that the measured
received signal strength may vary with the handset model. The
dashed line in Figure 1(a) shows received signal strength vs
distance for a pair of Samsung Galaxy A10 handsets. Observe
that the received signal strength is lower than with the Pixel 2’s
(presumably their transmit power and/or antenna gain differs)
and also the standard deviation is somewhat higher at around
10dB. We also collected measurements for a Huawei P10 and
the RSSI vs distance curve (not shown in the figure to avoid
clutter) is almost the same as that for the Pixel 2 but again
with somewhat higher standard deviation.
It is also important to note that due to reflections from
walls, furniture etc wireless signal propagation indoors is
usually more complex than it is outdoors. Figure 2(a) shows
measurements of received signal strength vs distance taken in a
relatively open domestic indoor space (shown in Figure 2(b)).
Observe the increase in received signal strength in Figure
2(a) as the distance increases from 2 to 2.5m. This effect is
consistent and reproducible using multiple devices, it is not
a measurement error. We believe that it is associated with
the narrowing of the indoor space that can be seen towards
the top of Figure 2(b), with the walls (formed from concrete

C. Signal Attenuation By Human Body
We also expect that attenuation of Bluetooth LE wireless
signals by the human body (Bluetooth LE transmits at 2.4GHz,
a frequency which is absorbed by water molecules hence why
it is also used in microwave ovens) may affect received signal
strength, and that the relative orientation of handsets may
matter. Figure 3(a) shows measurements of received signal
strength as a person rotates around a fixed point 1m away
from a mobile handset places flat on a wooden table. The
person carries a second handset in their left trouser pocket.
Figure 3(b) shows the experimental setup schematically.
It can be seen from Figure 3(a) that the received signal strength
varies by around 20dB as the person rotates. The received
signal strength is slightly higher (around -75dB) when the
person’s left side is oriented towards the fixed handset than
when their left-side is oriented away from the handset (around
-80 dB), as might be expected since in the latter case the
person’s body lies between the phone in their left pocket and
the fixed handset. Observe also that the received signal strength
is substantially higher (around -60dB) when the person is
facing the fixed handset than when they have their back to
it (around -80dB), again presumably due to signal absorption
by the person’s body (the pocket is located towards the front
of their trousers).
In Figure 3(a) both the signal path between the two handsets
and their relative orientations change. To separate out these
effects we also took measurements with two handsets held
in fixed positions at a 1m distance and roughly waist height
(1m above the ground). Figure 4 shows the measured received
signal strength as a person takes up various positions close to
one of the handsets. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it can be seen that
when the person stands close in front of the handset (roughly

5

We also took measurements with a person holding a phone in a
fixed position and orientation at chest height at a 1m distance
from a fixed handset. The received signal strength with the
person facing the fixed handset, so with an unobstructed path
between the two handsets, was observed to be around 10dB
higher than when the person faced away from the fixed handset
so that their torso lay on the signal path.

D. Signal Attenuation By Woman’s Handbag
Figure 5(a) plots received signal strength measurements for a
similar setup to the previous section but now with one handset
placed inside a handbag rather than in a trouser pocket. The
handbag contains other items (purse, cosmetics, hairbrush etc)
and the phone is located within a pocket inside the left side
of the bag. A second phone is placed 1m from the handbag
and the measurements are taken as the handbag is rotated, see
Figure 5(b) for a schematic of the setup.
In section (i) of Figure 5(a) the handbag is orientated so that
left-hand side is facing the second phone and a signal strength
of around -68dB is observed. The handbag is then rotated 180◦
so that the right-hand side of the bag now faces the second
phone, section (ii) of the plot. It can be seen that the signal
strength falls by about 10dB to around -75dB. The handbag is
now rotated by 90◦ so that it is end on to the second phone,
section (iii) of the plot, and this change increases the signal
strength to around -65dB.
E. Signal Attenuation By Walls In A Building
Figure 6 illustrates the impact of walls on signal propagation. Measurements are shown for a plasterboard stud wall
and for a 15cm thick blockwork wall in a 1930s Dublin

phone, (ii) the side of the bag containing the phone oriented
away the other phone (i.e. with a 180◦ rotation of the bag from
the initial position (i)) and (iii) with the handbag edge on to
the second phone (i.e. a 90◦ rotation from the initial position
(i)).

house. Comparing Figure 6(a) with the 1m point in Figure
1(a) it can be seen that the stud wall creates little signal
attenuation. In contrast, it can be seen from Figure 6(a) that
the blockwork wall attenuates the signal by around 20dB.
Blockwork is commonly used for the party walls separating
semi-detached houses and apartments. These measurements
therefore suggest there is little danger of Bluetooth signal
strength data triggering a false alarm regarding proximity
between people located in adjacent houses/apartments. Stud
walls, however, are widely used internally within buildings
and our measurements indicate that they have little effect
on Bluetooth received signal strength. Hence, false alarms
regarding proximity between people located in adjacent rooms
within the same building may be a concern.

We collected measurements of Bluetooth LE received signal
strength for two people walking the same 1.5km circuit along
suburban streets in Dublin in four different configurations: side
by side (shoulders touching), side by side maintaining a 1m
gap, one behind the other maintaining a 1m gap and a 2m gap.
Both people carry a mobile handset in their left-hand trouser
pocket.

Unfortunately the situation becomes more complex when other
configurations are considered. Figure 7(b) shows measurements taken when walking side by side while maintaining a 1m
gap and Figure 7(c) when walking one behind the other with a
1m gap. In the first case the received signal strength is around
-75db±10dB but in the second case it is much lower at around
-92dB±10dB i.e. similar to the signal strength measured when
one behind the other and 2m apart. This indicates that this data
cannot readily be used to distinguish between whether people
are 1m or 2m apart when they are walking behind each other.
That is, this data suggests that we cannot reliably distinguish
whether people are located less than 2m of each other when
walking behind each other in a city street, although we may
be able to distinguish this when people are walking side by
side.
Further investigation suggests that the substantial difference in
measured received signal strength at a distance of 1m seen in
Figures 7(b) and 7(c) is likely due to the changes in the relative
orientations of the handsets when walking side by side compared to when walking one behind the other. To help gain more
insight into this effect Figure 8 shows measurements taken
with two handsets placed 1m apart in fixed positions within an
open indoor area. The relative orientations of the handsets are
adjusted and the measured received signal strength recorded.
It can be seen that when one handset is edge on to the screen
of the other (so the two handsets are at a 90◦ angle to one
another) the received signal strength fluctuates around -85dB.
When the handsets are adjusted to be aligned edge on to one

Figure 7 shows time histories of the measured received signal
strength for each configuration. When the two people are walking close together, Figure 7(a), the received signal strength is
around -65dB±10dB. From Figure 7(d) it can be seen that
when walking with a 2m gap the received signal strength
consistently falls to around -95dB±10dB. That is, there is a
clear shift in received signal strength as the distance changes.
This suggests that the limited task of distinguishing between
whether people outdoors are side by side or one is 2m behind
the other, when no other configurations can occur, can indeed
likely be achieved using Bluetooth LE received signal strength
data.

between people walking in city streets. The observations from
this scenario are probably also applicable to people walking

to around -75dB, and when the handsets are then both placed
face down the received signal strength increases again by about
10db to around -65dB.
Roughly speaking, when two people are walking one behind
the other with handsets in their pockets then the handsets are
orientated edge on, i.e. similarly to the configuration in the
middle section of Figure 8. When the people walk side by side
the handsets are roughly orientated so that the screens face one
another. Data for this configuration is not shown in Figure 8,
but our measurements indicate that the received signal strength
at 1m is similar to that when the phones are lying flat i.e. to
the right-hand side of Figure 8 and around 10dB higher than
when the handsets are edge on. The data in Figure 8 is for

B. Scenario 2: Sitting Around A Meeting Table
Our second scenario aims to evaluate proximity measurement
within an office-based workplace. A crude model of workplace
movement is that during the work day people mainly spend
time either (i) at their desk and (ii) in meetings. Regarding
(i), if it is a shared office then if one person becomes
infected their office mates are known and so contact-tracing is
straightforward (with the possible exception of a large openplan office, but we leave evaluation of that more complex
scenario to future work). Regarding (ii), the hope is that
to assist with contact tracing we can augment an infected
persons recollection of meetings attended and of the other
people present by using Bluetooth LE received signal strength
measurements. We assume that during a meeting people spend
the bulk of their time sitting around a table and so we try to
evaluate the accuracy of Bluetooth LE signal strength data for
proximity detection in this scenario..
We collect measurements of Bluetooth LE received signal
strength with four people sitting around a wooden table as
illustrated schematically in Figure 9. We take measurements
both when people have their mobile handset in their trouser
pocket and when it is placed on the table.
Figures 10(a)-(b) shows the received signal strength measured
between person 1 and person 2 (i.e. two people sitting beside
each other at the table) and between person 1 and person 3
(i.e. between people sitting opposite each other) when their
mobile handset is in their trouser pocket. Figures 10(c)-(d)
show the corresponding data when each person places their
mobile handset on the table in front of them. It can seen
that there is a substantial difference in signal strength between
situations where the handsets are in people’s pockets vs when
they are placed on the table. When placed on the table the
received signal strength is around -65dB, a relatively high
level that allows the inference that the two people are located
close together. However, when the handsets are in people’s
trouser pockets the received signal strength is much lower
at around -80dB to -90dB. The low signal strength observed
when the handsets are in people’s trouser pockets is caused

a controlled indoor setup with no obstructions from people’s
bodies etc and so is not directly comparable to the data in
Figures 7(b)-(c), but it does suggest that significant shift in
received signal strength observed when walking side by side
vs one behind the other can largely be explained by the change
in relative phone orientation.

by a combination of signal absorption by people’s bodies and
the relative orientations of the phones.
Based on this received signal strength data this suggests it
would be hard to detect when people sitting close together at
a table unless people place their handsets on the table during
the meeting.

C. Scenario 3: Sitting In A Train Carriage
Our third scenario aims to evaluate proximity measurement
while travelling on public transport. Our rough model is
that people mainly spend their time seated and so we take
measurements of the received signal strength between various
seating positions. We focus on a train since Irish Rail very
kindly let us take measuments on two of their rail carriages
at short notice, but of course buses, trams and aircraft are
also important. While our measurements are taken within a
stationary train carriage we do not expect movement of the
carriage to change things much.
Figure 11(b) shows the carriage layout. Seats are arranged in
groups of four around a small table. We placed a handset on
one seat, indicated at the bottom left of Figure 11(b). A person
with a second handset in their left trouser pocket then sat in the
positions marked 1, 2 and 3 in Figure 11(b) and the received
signal signal strength from the first handset recorded. Figures
11(a), (d) and (d) show the measurements obtained. It can
be seen from Figures 11(a) and 11(c) that the received signal
strength is about -62dB when the person is seated around 1m
from the first handset, which is in quite good agreement with
Figure 1(a). When seated around 2.7m from the first handset

the signal strength falls to about -70dB, also in reasonable
agreement with Figure 1(a).
We also collected measurements of received signal strength
vs distance along the aisle in the middle of the rail carriage,
roughly at the seat height (approximately 50cm above the
floor), see Figure 12(b). The measurement setup used is the
same as that used in Figure 1. Figure 12(a) shows the measured
received signal strength, with the error bars indicating one
standard deviation. It can be seen that the received signal
strength remains roughly constant up to a distance of 2m and
then falls sharply. As noted above, seats in this carriage are
arranged in groups of four around small tables. The sharp fall
in received signal strength coincides with moving from one
group of four seats to another. This data therefore suggests
that the signal strength is high between seats with the same

group but lower between seats in different groups.
It can be seen from Figure 12(a) that the received signal
strength then stays roughly constant out to a distance of
4m, but appears to increase when moving from 3.5 to 4m
(recall that we expect signal strength to generally fall with
increasing distance). Hence while our measurements suggest
that received signal strength might be used to distinguish
between people sitting in the same group of seats and those
sitting in a different group, the increase in signal strength at
4m is potentially of concern for proximity detection based
on received signal strength. We note that the walls, floor and
ceiling of a train carriage are primarily made of metal, albeit
with the walls and ceiling lined with plastic cladding and the
floor with carpet. The seats also likely contain metal. Since
metal strongly reflects radio signals it is unsurprising that the
radio signal propagation behaves in quite a complex manner
and a further, more extensive, measurement campaign would
be prudent.
D. Scenario 4: Grocery Shopping
This scenario aims to evaluate the use of Bluetooth LE for
proximity measurement while grocery shopping in a typical
Irish supermarket. Grocery shopping is, of course, something
that everyone has to do and under the current lockdown for
many people it is also one of the few activities where they are
likely to come into relatively close contact with people outside
their immediate social circle.
Figure 13 shows received signal strength measurements taken
while two people were walking around a large supermarket in
suburban Dublin pushing a standard metal shopping trolley.
The supermarket is organised into aisles that are around
2m wide, with metal shelves, fridges/freezers etc and other

be seen that the received signal strength falls as people stand
further apart. A third person standing in between does not
change the received signal strength by much, see Figure
14(c). This data suggests that received signal strength might
successfully be used to detect proximity while queueing.

shoppers (who are social distancing) are also present, see
Figure 13(a). The two people walk one behind the other (the
relatively narrow aisles in the shop encourage this in any case)
and both carry a phone in their left-hand trouser pocket.
In Figure 13(b) the two people stay close together (although
still one behind the other) while walking, in Figure 13(c)
they walk one behind the other maintaining a distance of 2m.
Somewhat surprisingly, it can be seen that the received signal
strength measurements look much the same in both cases.
Presumably this is due to a mix of the impact of the handset
orientation already noted when walking one behind the other,
and of the effect on wireless signal propagation of the complex
environment (metal shelves etc) within the supermarket.
These measurements suggest that received signal strength
probably cannot be used to distinguish between whether
people are close together or 2m apart when walking around
a supermarket. However, we note that it is probably unlikely
that people will spend more than 15 minutes within 2 metres
of each other while walking around a supermarket, and so
failure to detect close proximity using received signal strength
is perhaps of less importance than in other scenarios. Of
more concern are false positives, where people are detected
as being close together when in fact they are not, in light of
the relatively high received signal strengths we see in Figure
13(c) when people are 2m apart.
Current social distance measures in Ireland limit the number
of people who can be inside a shop at the same time. This
means that people often need to queue outside until allowed
to enter. While queueing people are asked to remain spaced 2m

While there have been some studies on use of the magnetometers on smartphones for contact tracing, e.g. see [15], [16], to
the best of our knowledge there are no previous measurement
studies on the use of Bluetooth LE specifically in the context
of contact tracing. Perhaps the closest work is FluPhone [17],
an approach proposed in 2011 that made use of Bluetooth
rather than Bluetooth LE and did not try to distinguish between
contact events where people are less than 2m apart and when
they are further away (the app simply logged all observed
Bluetooth MAC addresses). Use of Bluetooth LE for proximity
detection has, however, been investigated in the context of
measuring social interaction and also indirectly in the context
of indoor localisation.

A. Proximity Detection Using Bluetooth LE
Bluetooth LE was standardised in 2010 with the first devices
using Bluetooth LE appearing in 2011-12, although the original (non-low energy) Bluetooth Classic technology is older.
The use of the Bluetooth received signal strength reported by
smartphones to infer proximity has received attention since
around 2014, mainly in the context of studies on social interaction in indoor office settings and only more recently making
using of Bluetooth LE. In summary, this work highlights
that (i) simple thresholding of received signal strength to
estimate proximity results in a high error-rate, (ii) by using
standard machine learning classifiers much better accuracy can
be achieved, but since these are supervised learning methods
they require training data, which is generally difficult and timeconsuming to obtain (in these studies determining ground truth
involved manual observation of camera footage or shadowing
of people by observers).
One of the earliest studies is that reported in [6]. This makes
use of Bluetooth (rather than Bluetooth LE). Measurements
are collected as two people carrying mobile handsets follow
a prescribed path on a university campus, walking between
two buildings and spending time indoors and outdoors. The
aim is to use received signal strength to detect when the two
people are within 1.5m of each other. It was found that simple
thresholding of the received signal strength yields a high error
rate of around 50% even when people are in the proximity
of one another for 10 mins. Averaging of the measured signal
strength values improves the accuracy somewhat, but since the
signal strength was observed to vary significantly depending
on whether people were indoors or outdoors then in order to

10

achieve a low error rate the authors needed to employ multiple
thresholds tuned to the particular environment used on the
study, combined with use of a light sensor to detect operation
indoors or out. The latter meant that operation in evening and
at night needed to be excluded. A much larger follow-up study
is also reported on in [6] but since it lacks ground truth it is
hard to draw quantitative conclusions regarding the accuracy
with which proximity is estimated.
Around the same time the use of Bluetooth (again, not
Bluetooth LE) for proximity detection was also considered by
[7]. In this study it is noted that phone orientation can have
a substantial effect on received signal strength. Water-filled
cylinders with mobile handsets attached were used to collect
baseline data on received signal strength that was then used
to train a Decision Tree classifier. In experiments involving 8
students interacting in an office environment, and with ground
truth obtained via a human observer, proximity was estimated
with an accuracy of around 80%.
More recently, [8] studies the use of Bluetooth LE for proximity sensing within 3m. They use custom Bluetooth LE bracelets
rather than smartphones and take measurements in an officebased workplace. Ground truth is obtained by an observer
logging all interactions, plus the office space is equipped with
multiple static beacons whose transmissions are logged by the
smartphones. A Decision Tree classifier was trained using this
data and an accuracy of around 80% reported for Bluetooth LE
settings similar to those used in Android. Similarly, last year
[9] reports on a study where people carry iBeacons. Data is
collected data for 24 people interacting in a 6m by 5m indoor
space with ground truth on interactions being obtained via two
video cameras covering the indoor space. A Regression Tree
classifier achieves an accuracy of around 80%.

B. iBeacons & Indoor Localisation Using Bluetooth LE
Apple introduced iBeacons using Bluetooth LE in mid2013 [18], [19]. These are typically placed in fixed locations
indoors and transmit Bluetooth LE beacons. These beacons
typically transmit at low power so that they can only be
detected when a receiver is relatively close and this allows
them to be used by a mobile handset to roughly estimate its
location within an office or shop. Handsets use the received
signal strength to estimate their distance from an iBeacon, but
this is limited to whether the beacon is immediate, near, far or
has unknown status. Other manufacturers have since developed
similar beacon technology.
There has, of course, been much interest in obtaining more accurate distance estimates so as to improve indoor localisation.
However, received signal strength measurements are known to
exhibit large fluctuations, e.g. see [10], and so in more recent
work it has been common to (i) try to combine received signal
strength data with other measurements e.g. accelerometer and
time of flight data, and (ii) employ machine learning methods
to help map from received signal strength data to distance,
similarly to the approaches adopted by the proximity detection

community (see above). See [10], [11], [12], and citations
therein for recent work in this direction.
VI. S UMMARY AND C ONCLUSIONS
We report on measurements of the Bluetooth LE received
signal strength taken on mobile handsets in a variety of
common, real-world settings. In summary, we find that the
Bluetooth LE received signal strength can vary substantially
depending on the relative orientation of handsets, on absorption by the human body, reflection/absorption of radio signals
in buildings and trains. Indeed we observe that the received
signal strength need not decrease with increasing distance.
This suggests that the development of accurate methods for
proximity detection based on Bluetooth LE received signal
strength is likely to be challenging and time consuming.
Our measurements also suggest that it may be necessary for
Bluetooth LE contact tracing apps to be combined with the
adoption of new social protocols to yield benefits although
this requires further study. For example, placing phones on the
table during meetings is likely to simplify proximity detection
using received signal strength. Similarly, carrying handbags
with phones placed close to the outside surface. In locations
where the complexity of signal propagation makes proximity
detection using received signal strength problematic, additional
non-Bluetooth LE mechanisms may be required.
Looking ahead, further work is needed to try to quantify the
error rates of proximity detection methods based on Bluetooth
LE received signal strength. In particular, it is important to
distinguish between false positives (where people are flagged
as having been in contact with an infected person but in fact
have not been) and false negatives (where people are not
flagged as having been in contact with an infected person,
but in fact were). False positives are likely when the received
signal strength does not decrease sufficiently quickly with
distance, and false negatives when the received signal strength
decreases too quickly. Our data suggests that there may be
significant potential for both types of error in common, realworld situations. False positives are of concern since they
mean that people may be led to unnecessarily self-isolate with
associated disruption and perhaps also leading to a loss of
confidence in the contact tracing app if the error rate is too
high. False negatives are of concern since they directly reduce
the effectiveness of contact tracing for disease control, namely
they mean that people in contact with an infected person may
inadvertently spread the infection further.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
These measurements were taken in Dublin, Ireland during
the Coronavirus lockdown. Both authors would like thank
their families for helping with the measurement experiments,
they wouldn’t have been possible without them. The authors
would also like to extend sincere thanks to Irish Rail for their
generous permission to take measurements inside their train
carriages.
