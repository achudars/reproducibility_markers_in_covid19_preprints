Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed multiple public health, socio-economic, and institutional
crises. Measures taken to slow the spread of the virus have fostered significant strain between authorities
and citizens, leading to waves of social unrest and anti-government demonstrations. We study the
temporal nature of pandemic-related disorder events as tallied by the “COVID-19 Disorder Tracker"
initiative by focusing on the three countries with the largest number of incidents, India, Israel, and
Mexico. By fitting Poisson and Hawkes processes to the stream of data, we find that disorder events are
inter-dependent and self-excite in all three countries. Geographic clustering confirms these features at the
subnational level, indicating that nationwide disorders emerge as the convergence of meso-scale patterns of
self-excitation. Considerable diversity is observed among countries when computing correlations of events
between subnational clusters; these are discussed in the context of specific political, societal and geographic
characteristics. Israel, the most territorially compact and where large scale protests were coordinated in
response to government lockdowns, displays the largest reactivity and the shortest period of influence
following an event, as well as the strongest nationwide synchrony. In Mexico, where complete lockdown
orders were never mandated, reactivity and nationwide synchrony are lowest. Our work highlights
the need for authorities to promote local information campaigns to ensure that livelihoods and virus
containment policies are not perceived as mutually exclusive.

Introduction

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global
pandemic. No country has been spared from the far-reaching impacts of the ensuing viral disease,
termed COVID-19, which touched and transformed most, if not all, aspects of societal living. In the
absence of a widely available vaccine, and in light of the many unknowns posed by the pandemic,
governments responded with a wide array of measures aimed at avoiding large scale public health
crises with varying degrees of resources, capacity, and resolve. These included restrictions on
travel and mobility, social distancing and quarantine requirements, imposing school and business

closures, implementing large scale testing, prohibiting large crowd gatherings. Periods of more
or less stringent orders alternated depending on the local ebbs and flows of the pandemic. In
parallel, governments also increased spending to reduce the risk of permanent damage to their
economies and to alleviate unemployment and poverty. Policymakers have been confronted with
philosophical and moral questions centered on how to balance individual freedoms and preserving
the economy while protecting the lives of vulnerable populations, and on whether utilitarianoutcome or kantian-deontological approaches should be taken [27]. In addition, especially at
the onset of the pandemic, different jurisdictions adopted different strategies due to the limited
scientific understanding of COVID-19, and without being able to fully anticipate the medium-term
health, social and political implications of their decisions. Sweden for example chose not to enter
a lockdown while the rest of Europe did; in the US emergency orders were implemented after
non-uniform threshold levels were met across the country, resulting in significant variability from
county to county. Similarly, the recent announcement of the development of effective vaccines is
marked by questions not only on how to optimally scale up production but also how to distribute
vaccines in an ethical manner.
While not perfect and difficult to evaluate, the above interventions for the most part helped
prevent more widespread transmission and buffer worse economic fallouts. By the same token,
they have provoked concerns over becoming drivers of economic uncertainty and deprivation
[44], reinforcing economic inequality [18, 20], engendering political distrust [50], and leading to
long-term mental health consequences as a result of prolonged physical isolation and reduced
human interaction [21]. Ultimately COVID-19 has caused what are poised to be long-lasting
economic, financial, and social crises worldwide.
Traditional and social media have played a significant role in disseminating COVID-19 related
information. They have helped turn best practices into habits, and offered personalized networking
opportunities in times of solitude. However, politicization of the pandemic, the sharing of nonvetted yet sensational or controversial findings or hypothesis, and algorithmic manipulation by
platform hosts, have allowed for conspiracy theories and misinformation to spread, causing anxiety
and discontent.
All these ingredients – the emergence of a pandemic most were not prepared for, the difficulty
for policymakers in make clear-sighted decisions that could be well received by a diverse set of
stakeholders, the online spread of distorted information, personal fears and the need to connect to
others – have arguably combined to spark pandemic-related social unrest throughout the globe as
manifest by the numerous protests, riots and disorders recorded in many countries. Although
these events have attracted media attention and ignited public debate, their characteristics and
timing are poorly understood. Protests ignited by past outbreaks offer little insight into current
societal unrest due to their comparatively limited spatio-temporal scope, and the lack of accurate
data collection at the time they occurred.
In this paper we investigate the temporal distribution of civil disorders directly attributable
to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic and, specifically, the temporal clustering and self-excitability
of events. These “contagion” trends are recurrent in human activity and have been observed in
criminal behavior [49, 31], terrorist attacks [33, 12], political shocks [51, 28], violent conflicts [10,
48] and collective protesting and rioting [52, 38, 40]. We hypothesize they also characterize the
current COVID-19 protests worldwide.
Our analyses focus on the three countries that were most hit by protests, riots, and violent
events directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, namely India, Israel, and Mexico, as per data
made available through the “COVID-19 Disorded Tracker” (CDT) initiative curated by the “Armed
Conflict Location & Event Data Project” (ACLED) [47]. While we recognize that peaceful protests
are distinct from riots or episodes of violence against civilians, and that they carry different

2

features and theoretical implications [22], we do not discriminate among them in our analyses
due to their shared, high-level etiological trigger: the COVID-19 pandemic. Note that concurrent
with the unfolding of the COVID-19 crisis are other episodes of civil unrest whose primary
source is not pandemic-related, most notably the Black Lives Matter protests that originated in
Minneapolis in late May 2020 in the wake of George Floyd’s murder and that persist at this time
of writing. ACLED does not tally these events, and we do not include them in our work as
these demonstrations arise primarily in response to racial injustice, although racial disparities in
COVID-19 cases may have contributed to the unrest.
For each of the three countries we focus on, we study the temporal clustering and selfexcitability of pandemic-related demonstrations on the national and subnational scales. We
assume all events recorded by ACLED in a given country are part of the same underlying stream
of events, whereas on the local level we construct mutually exclusive geographical clusters through
k-means clustering. Temporal self-excitation is studied by applying the Hawkes process [26], a
stochastic point process initially used to understand aftershocks in the vicinity of an earthquake
epicenter, and later adapted to finance, cell signaling, disease-spread and human activity. Hawkes
processes are non-Markovian extensions of Poisson processes. The latter are memory-less with
events following a random temporal distribution, whereas the likelihood of an event in a Hawkes
process depends on past ones, leading to clustering, memory effects, and self-excitability. These
features are well-suited to study human behaviors that appear to be patterned in time. We fit
both Poisson and Hawkes processes to data within each cluster to verify if and how temporal
clustering emerges at various subnational scales.
Our analysis reveals that temporal clustering of pandemic-related demonstrations is a common
feature in all three countries. Despite variations in the temporal distribution of events and
in the magnitude of self-excitability and reactivity across the three different contexts, Hawkes
processes better capture the underlying dynamics present in the data compared to Poisson
processes. Furthermore, we find that self-excitability at the national level appears to emerge
as the convergence of subnational, cluster-based self-excitatory events, rather than as the result
of a meso-level stream of events. Our results highlight the interplay between the national and
subnational socio-political discourse in the emergence of large-scale disorders that may erupt in
response to centralized decisions, with information easily channeled through social media and
other communication networks, but may also manifest locally, with the global source of discontent
becoming particularized to local grievances and sources of tension.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the Background section we briefly
review the protesting and rioting literature in other contexts. We also provide a synthetic account
of the evolution of the pandemic in each of the three countries under investigation. In the Materials
and Methods section will describe the ACLED data we utilize and outline our methodology. The
statistical outcomes of our inferential models, along with additional analyses on the temporal
characteristics of events in each country and cluster, are presented in the Results section. Finally,
in the Discussion and Conclusion section we discuss the relevance of our results and their broader
significance.

Background

COVID-19-related social unrest has been observed in several countries in the form of protests,
riots, and other demonstrations, often in response to virus-containment decisions imposed by
governments. These decisions may have seemed too onerous, unfair, or the root cause of economic
uncertainty. It is important to understand the characteristics of this unrest for two reasons: one is
preventative, as demonstrations always carry the risk of widespread contagion, given their often
3

chaotic and crowded nature, and of devolving into uncontrolled, violent clashes with authorities
and/or among protesters and counter-protesters. The other is more introspective, as these protests
may be manifestations of latent societal discontent, predating the pandemic, invigorated by newly
mandated restrictive policies.
Though unique in its global reach, the current pandemic does not represent a unicum in terms
of the social unrest it has caused. History has repeatedly been marked by uprising and protests
in response to social, political, and economic crises. In recent decades, social movements and
collective action have mobilized citizens in demanding changes to political regimes, economic
policies, and more respect for human rights. A vast academic literature has emerged as a result,
to study why, how, when large scale peaceful and violent demonstrations occur and what their
repercussions may be [13]. Sociological and social movement studies [16] have been central
in describing various theoretical frameworks underlying social unrest. Political science studies
have helped dissect the political conditions in which riots and protests flourish and anticipate
possible micro– and macro–consequences such as conflicts, regime changes, and revolutions [24].
Criminological studies have concentrated on understanding how deviant behavior can emerge
in non-peaceful assemblies and in outlining related policing strategies [23, 6]. Psychological
studies have helped unveil the behavioral and cognitive mechanisms occurring in individuals
when engaged in collective action [53, 19].
The last decades have also witnessed the increased use of quantitative methodologies to study
disorder events of various nature that have been used across disciplines and that have helped
uncover consistent patterns. At the end of the 1970s, T.J. Sullivan [52] and M.I. Midlarsky [38],
while belonging to distinct academic fields (social psychology and political science, respectively),
highlighted “universal” features in the size distribution and dynamical evolution of crowds.
M.I. Midlarsky, in particular, emerged as a strong advocate for the incorporation of quantitative
frameworks within the study of collective social phenomena. In one of his seminal works, he
demonstrated the presence of two underlying processes driving the urban disorders of 1966-67
in several US cities, diffusion and contagion, at a time when neither had been proven. The same
empirical techniques were later applied to the study of transnational terrorism [39].
The greater availability of data in recent years has vastly improved our understanding of
societal unrest and has led to refined statistical and computational approaches. Sources include
law enforcement and institutional organizations, social media platforms and news agencies [46, 54,
30]. Among the most investigated scenarios are the 2005 Paris riots [7, 9], the 2011 London riots
[5, 15], political protests in Latin America [11] and the Arab Spring [29]. In all cases non-random
behaviors were detected such as clustering processes, cascading dynamics, and self-excitability.
Complementary theoretical propositions helped diagnose the causal mechanisms of the inferred
patterns and include hierarchical patterns [37, 34], rational choice [15], identity theory [36].
In the spirit of expanding the extant literature on human dynamics during disorders, we focus
on pandemic-related demonstrations in the three nations that exhibit the greatest number of
events, India, Israel and Mexico. Although these countries vary greatly in terms of geographical,
socio-political, and economic fabric, our data-driven study will show that self-excitability and
clustering emerge across all three as fundamental features of pandemic-related protests and riots.

Overview of the pandemic in select countries

i.1

India

At present, India is the country with the second-highest recorded number of COVID-19 cases
worldwide, behind the USA and with more than 10 million infections, corresponding to roughly

4

12% of the global count [17]. The first case to be confirmed was a medical student returning
from Wuhan, China to the state of Kerala who tested positive on January 30th 2020 [2]. India’s
first fatality was reported on March 12th , amidst growing numbers of infections. On March 22th ,
Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a 14-hour voluntary national lockdown, which became
mandatory three days later, when only essential services were allowed to remain open. On April
14th the lockdown was extended to May 3rd and on April 29th India’s death toll reached one
thousand. On May 1st , the lockdown was extended for two more weeks, although allowing for
more flexibility depending on local infection trends. Other economic, financial and social measures
were introduced as lockdown restrictions were extended through the end of May. Starting in June,
containment policies were progressively eased. On August 30th , the country recorded the highest
number of new cases worldwide, in excess of 78,000 [8]; this record was shattered on September
12th when India tallied more than 95,000 infections. Schools were partially reopened at the end
of summer and on September 30th states and Union Territories were allowed local autonomy on
certain pandemic-related matters. Daily cases have been declining since then, and at the time of
writing there is little evidence of a second wave.
Protests against the government’s management of the COVID-19 crisis have been widespread
and sustained. Migrant workers unable to return home due to lockdown orders staged protests
at railway stations, health workers went on strike over the lack of protective equipment and
adequate pay, agricultural workers demanded payment of lockdown wages and protested the lack
of aid despite government promises, students demonstrated against holding University admission
exams and requested they be deferred due to infection risks and the difficulty of reaching exam
centers. General strikes were organized to rally against poverty and unemployment triggered by
COVID-19. On some occasions, episodes of state repression and violent enforcement of lockdown
orders occurred as an attempt to quell these disorders. Long standing conflicts tied to identity
politics, immigration, secessionist movements and boundary disputes have also been impacted by
COVID-19. Massive protests had engulfed the country in 2019 and early 2020 in response to the
Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which would grant citizenship rights on the basis of religion.
Political and separatist demonstrations, including those related to the CAA, declined following
lockdown orders but reignited in June as restrictions eased, adding to pandemic-related disorders.
In India 55.4% of the total population had internet access in 2020.
i.2

Israel

Israel recorded its first confirmed COVID-19 case on February 21st 2020, after the return of a female
citizen quarantined on the Diamond Princess in Japan [32]. Authorities soon issued a 14-day
isolation policy for citizens who had visited South Korea or Japan; social distancing and related
measures were imposed on March 11th , a ban on public gatherings of more than 10 people followed
on March 15th . Finally, on March 19th , a state of emergency was declared and a national lockdown
imposed. A contact-tracing program was approved on March 16th , allowing the Israeli Security
Agency to track the mobility of individuals through mobile phone data. The program quickly
sparked controversy and nationwide protests over the invasion of privacy and the overreaching
surveillance of citizens. It was halted at the end of April. Additional restrictions were imposed
between the end of March, in anticipation of the Passover Seder festivity on April 8th including a
travel ban and the creation of a restricted zone in Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox town east of Tel
Aviv with one of the highest rates of coronavirus cases in the country. Restrictions were eased
between the end of April and the beginning of May. Retail stores were allowed to open on April
24th ; school reopenings took place between May 3rd and May 19th . In July, in response to steadily
increasing “second wave” infections, the Knesset reauthorized the contact-tracing program, once

5

more igniting civil liberties organizations; new social distancing rules were also imposed. A
“traffic light” monitoring plan was announced on August 31st whereby a color representative of
risk levels would be assigned to all Israeli cities. Each color would be associated to more or less
restrictive rules. On September 6th schools were closed and night-time curfews were imposed
on forty high risk communities, including nine in Jerusalem, affecting approximately 1.3 million
people. A new national lockdown was issued for September 18th , concurrent with the Jewish
High Holy Days, and further restrictions announced on September 23rd . On October 18th some
restrictions were lifted, with further reopenings announced throughout November 2020, although
some high impacted communities remained under lockdown. Finally, a “third wave” of infections
was accompanied by a third nationwide lockdown imposed on December 27th .
Protests in Israel have been common throughout the pandemic, with demonstrations against
the government’s handling of the crisis, and the alleged corruption of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. After restrictions were placed to curb demonstrations, nationwide protests were held
on October 3rd . Clashes with police, rock-throwing and confrontations between protesters and
anti-protesters were recorded. In Israel 81.6% of the total population had internet access in 2020.
i.3

Mexico

On February 28th 2020, Mexico confirmed its first COVID-19 cases as three men who had traveled
to Bergamo, Italy; the first COVID-19 related death was recorded on March 18th . On March 23rd
President Andrès López Obrador unveiled a national campaign to promote social distancing,
self-isolation, and other measures to contain the spread of the virus. On March 30th , Mexico
declared a state of health emergency, suspending all nonessential activities for a month. Plans
for gradual reopening were announced on May 18th , with the mayor of Mexico City presenting a
blueprint for a “new normality” in the capital on May 20th . On June 1st the government imposed a
traffic light monitoring plan at the state level, similar to the one described for Israel. Cases steadily
increased starting from the end of May leading to overcrowded hospitals. On July 30th it was
announced that governors who altered the traffic light status of their states would face criminal
sanctions. Record new cases of more than 10,000 new infections were recorded on November 25th .
A few weeks into the pandemic, several media outlets began reported that drug cartels were
distributing food and medical supplies to citizens; over time criticisms mounted on government’s
handling of the pandemic, the too modest spending on public heath and measures to help the
economy, the many deaths in Mexico City, inadequate testing, medical personnel, waste disposal,
and possible concealment of the real number of COVID-19 cases and fatalities. The president has
been accused of having resisted full lockdown measures despite rising cases, to keep the economy
open, drawing criticism from the WHO and the IMF. At this time of writing, Mexico is still among
the most affected countries, with more than one fifth concentrated in its capital.
Labor groups have protested the government’s inadequate support of the population during
the pandemic, including of those who work in the informal economy; citizen groups demanded
the resignation of President López Obrador for his handling of the pandemic. Other forms of
pandemic-related disorders include street vendors protesting closures of their businesses, residents
protesting over unsubstantiated rumors of COVID-19 inducing substances being spread by drones,
against checkpoints that limited access to certain cities, and over mask-wearing.
Similarly as to India, conflicts pre-dating the pandemic were paused in the early months of
COVID-19 only to later intensify. Most notably, gang violence and drug cartel battles increased
during the summer, as travel restrictions were lifted and the drug trade reorganized itself to adapt
to the new circumstances. Mexico has also witnessed a large increase in murders and especially
femicides as COVID-19 restrictions have made women more vulnerable to domestic violence.

6

Despite the pandemic, demonstrations calling for the safety of women have continued. In Mexico
70.5% of the total population had internet access in 2020.

Materials and Methods

Data

Our analyses are based on data obtained from the COVID-19 Disorder Tracker (CDT) initiative of
the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). ACLED is a well-known open-source
data collection organization cataloguing global crises and conflicts, created to facilitate the study of
political violence and social unrest. Its recent CDT initiative records events that are directly related
to COVID-19 and excludes disorders that may temporally overlap with the pandemic but that are
not directly related to it, such as conflicts between armed militias over a disputed territory. The
dataset includes, for example, protests against governments in response to COVID-19 decisions,
attacks against COVID-19 healthcare workers, or against individuals who may allegedly spread
the virus to others. Events are labeled as one of six types: violence against civilians, riots, protests,
explosions, battles, and strategic developments. We exclude the strategic development category as
it lists contextually relevant episodes that are not political violence but that may trigger, lessen or
explain them. These are typically tactical changes by one of the relevant actors, such a government
announcing a state of emergency or the easing of lockdown restrictions. In addition to type, the
dataset records date and location of the event, the subjects involved, reported fatalities. Data
is collected from governmental institutions, news media, humanitarian agencies, and research
publications. The database is updated every week; in this work we included events occurring
between January 3rd to December 12th 2020. Within this interval, a total of 20,135 disorder events
were recorded worldwide. When considering weekly averages we will consider Sunday as the
first day of the week and Saturday as the last. Hence, weekly averages will be conducted over the
period January 5th to December 12th 2020, yielding weeks 2 to 50 of the year 2020. Week 1 of 2020
is the period between December 29th 2019 and January 4th 2020. Since disorder events were first
recorded on January 3rd 2020 we assume all prior dates in week 1 carry zero events.
Table 1 lists the ten countries with the highest number of incidents; we focus on the first three:
India, Israel and Mexico. These countries alone account for almost 40% of all the events included
in the CDT dataset. Figure 1 shows the distribution of event type per country. As can be seen,
most are protests, with a smaller number of riots (mostly in India and to a lesser degree in Mexico),
a marginal presence of violence against civilians, and an almost negligible number of battles. No
explosions were recorded in any of the countries of interest, leaving only four relevant categories
as detailed in Appendix i.
Figure 2 displays the time-series of all types of events for the countries we investigate. As can
be seen, trends differ due to the different political timelines. In India, the first pandemic-related
event was recorded in January 2020, but was followed by only five others over the first two months
of the year. Most disorders in India occurred in April (431 events, 14.8% of the countrywide total),
May (592 events, 20.3% of the countrywide total), and June (481 events, 16.5% of the countrywide
total). On June 29th 123 protests were tallied nationwide, the largest number during the period of
interest and corresponding to 4.2% of the total number of events in India. These protests were
promoted by Congress in opposition to increasing fuel prices despite economic hardships due
to the coronavirus crisis. In Israel disorders first emerged in March 2020, however the greatest
number of demonstrations occurred in October (1,427 events, 40.4% of the countrywide total) and
in November (1,037 events 29.4% of the countrywide total). The dramatic spikes observed in this
period overlap with the lockdown orders announced at the onset of the second wave of infections;

the Black Flag Movement promoted nationwide demonstrations. In Mexico, disorders also first
appeared in March 2020. However, the distribution of events here seems to be more uniform than
in India and Israel; this may be due to Mexico never having imposed a complete, countrywide
lockdown. The highest recorded number of disorders in the country were tallied on March 30th
(36 events) when health workers protested against the lack of medical supplies and equipment,
and on April 27th (28 events) and May 25th (32 events) when citizens demanded better economic
and financial aid. Overall, the most demonstrations took place in April (289 events, 22.7% of the
countrywide total) and in May (275 events 21.6% of the countrywide total).

i.1

Spatial clustering

Spatial-temporal concentration is a well-known signature of social phenomena, including disorder
events [4, 15]. To examine the spatial distribution of disorders as listed in the CDT dataset
for the three countries of interest, we first identify subnational geographic areas where events
colocalize. We do this by using k-means clustering, a well-known algorithm which assigns each
event to one of k clusters by iteratively updating the centers of these clusters and minimizing the
root-mean-square distance between the event location and its assigned cluster center [35]. The
number of clusters k is a parameter for the algorithm; as it increases, the average mean distance of
events from their assigned center typically decreases. However, beyond a critical threshold k∗ , the
decrease rate may become negligible, indicating that new clusters are not distinguishable from
old ones. As shown in Appendix ii, applying k-means clustering to the CDT data for India, Israel
and Mexico, yields k∗ = 4 as this critical threshold for all three. Henceforth, we will consider four
geographical clusters per country.
i.2

Hawkes process

The temporal Hawkes process [26, 14, 3] models the distribution of a random time variable as a
non-homogeneous Poisson process with a time-dependent intensity function λ(t) defined as
λ(t) = lim

h →0

E( N (t + h) − N (t))
.
h

(1)

Here N (t) = ∑i 1ti ≤t is number of events up to time t. The index i labels the events so that the
event time sequence {ti } defines the point process. Thus, λ(t) measures the number of events
that are expected to arrive per unit time. For a homogeneous Poisson process E( N (t)) = λt is
proportional to time and λ(t) = λ is constant. Within non-homogeneous Hawkes processes λ(t)
is typically decomposed into a background intensity µ(t), often assumed to be constant µ(t) = µ,
and an excitatory component g(t) triggered at the times ti of past events so that
λ(t) = µ +

∑ g ( t − ti )

(2)

ti < t

9

We model the excitatory function g(t) through an exponential decay, according to standard
protocols
λ(t) = µ +

∑ αe−β(t−ti ) ,

(3)

ti < t

where α and β quantify the self-excitatory degree of the process. Here, α represents a jump factor
representing the rate of increase of events immediately after a triggering, prior event, while β is
the associated decay rate; 1/β is often used as a proxy for the typical lifetime of an excitation.
Large values of α and small values of β imply the process is highly reactive and its effects last
longer, respectively [33]. The α and β parameters are learned by applying maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) to Eq. 3 where {ti } is known and the µ, β, α parameters are to be determined, as
described in Appendix iii. From α and β one can derive the branching ratio γ, an estimate of the
total number of events that are endogenously generated by a single event
γ=

Z ∞

αe− βt dt =

(4)

If one considers “immigrant" events those that occur independently within a given generation,
and the ones they trigger at the next generation as their “offspring", γ may also be interpreted
as the total expected number of offsprings triggered by an immigrant event. The so-called
supercritical regime γ > 1 implies that the number of offspring events is larger than the number
of immigrant events that generated them, leading to the unrealistic scenario of an infinite cascade.
Hence, the γ < 1 constraint is imposed in the maximum likelihood estimation. The sub-critical
regime ensures that the cascade of events triggered by an original immigrant event will eventually
subside. Thus, assuming γ < 1, we can also estimate the total number of offspring events N∞
generated by a single immigrant event. If at each generation γ offspring events arise, the number
of events at generation j is given by γ j−1 , where j = 1 represents the first, single, immigrant event.
Hence the total number of offspring events is

∑ γ j −1 = 1 − γ .

The last equality in Eq. 7 implies that γ < 1 also represents the percent of events per unit
time that are endogenously generated. We apply Eq. 2 to our data, both as a baseline Poisson
process (setting the self-excitability function g = 0) so that λ(t) = λ = µ and making the process
Markovian, and as a Hawkes process (g 6= 0, and as in Eq. 3). To compare results, we determine
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values of the two models defined as
AIC = 2κ − 2logL

(8)

10

where κ is the total number of parameters used (κ = 1 for a Poisson process and κ = 3 for a
Hawkes process) and logL is the MLE of the model as described in Appendix iii. By construction,
the model with the lowest AIC value is the one that best fits the data.
We also employ residual analysis to validate the choice of the exponential function g in
modeling the self-excitability of the process [42] Given the intensity function λ(t) of a Hawkes
process and the set of event times {ti } we can derive the set of residuals {τi } defined as
τi =

Z t
i
0

λ(t)dt

(9)

It can be shown that the {τi } residuals are independent and follow a stationary Poisson process
with unit rate [42, 43]. This implies that the inter-arrival values Yi = τi − τi−1 , defined for i > 1
and where τ0 = 0 is imposed, define a set of independent and exponentially distributed variables.
Finally, it follows that the derived quantities Ui = 1 − e−Yi are also independent and uniformly
distributed. To test the goodness of fit of the Hawkes process we can thus verify whether the
0 ≤ Ui < 1 values are indeed uniformly distributed. Operationally, we employ the two-tailed
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, a common non-parametric test that determines whether a set of
given observations (in this case {Ui }) come from a known distribution (in this case the uniform
distribution between 0 and 1) [55]. The test compares the value of the statistic D

to a given critical value Dc . In Eq. 10, U is the cardinality of the {Ui } set, which is the number of
observations and same as the cardinality of the {Yi } and {τi } sets. If D > Dc , then the hypothesis
that the {Ui } values follow a uniform distribution, and hence that the {ti } values define a Hawkeslike point process, can√be rejected at the α level of significance. We
√ apply the KS test to our data at
the 95% ( Dα = 1.36/ U , α = 0.05) and at the 99% ( Dα = 1.63/ U ), α = 0.01) confidence levels.
Other tabulated values for Dc and different confidence levels can be used [41].

Results

India

The four spatial clusters we identified in India are visualized in Figure 3; for the most part they
follow geographical and/or topographical divisions within the country. Cluster 1 (C1), which
includes the northern states of Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarkhand,
and the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, accounts for a total of 913 events.
Cluster 2 (C2) accounts for the majority of disorder events within the country, 946, and covers
the eastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha. The third cluster
(C3) groups 436 in the central and western states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh.
Finally, Cluster 4 (C4) accounts for a total of 568 events in the southern states, including Kerala,
Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana.
Figure 4 displays the number of events n j occurring during week j in each of the C1-C4
clusters. For all clusters we observe the first spiking of events around week j = 13 and j = 14
(between March 22nd and April 4th 2020) followed by a second period of intensifying activity
around week j = 27 (between June 28th and July 4th ), although the relative magnitude of events
are cluster-dependent. Distribution summaries are shown in Fig. 5: C2 has the highest average
number of disorders per week and the highest variability, followed by C1. Interestingly, while

and investigate how differences in weekly counts correlate between clusters. The right panel of
Fig. 6 shows that when using {∆n j } the positive association between clusters lowers significantly
compared to when {n j } is used, but remains significant in some clusters indicating partial national
synchrony. Specifically, C3 and C4 carry the highest correlation value, r = 0.512, whereas the
weakest relationship is between C1 and C2, for which r = 0.124. Noteworthy is the relationship
between C1 and C3, which has the highest r relative to {n j } counts and the second-lowest r relative
to {∆n j } counts. Numerical values are listed in Appendix iv.

Table 2: Statistical outcomes of the Hawkes process applied to data from India. The Hawkes process outperforms the
baseline Poisson process both nationwide and in each cluster, since the Hawkes AIC is always less than the
Poisson AIC. The Hawkes process passes the KS test at the 95% significance level in all cases, with D < Dc95 .

events daily. Here, the Hawkes process with an exponential excitatory term g always leads to
lower AIC values compared to the baseline Poisson process, indicating a considerable degree
of self-excitability and temporal dependence in the data. All cases considered (national and
subnational Hawkes processes) passed the KS test, as can be verified by the D values being lower
than the critical KS value in Table 2. We tally 2,910 countrywide disorders, which if treated as
a Hawkes process on the national scale, lead to a background rate of µ = 0.5 events per day
with self-excitatory events arising at a rate of α = 2.07 events per day, spanning over 1/β = 0.46
days. These values lead to a branching ratio γ = α/β = 0.95, revealing that a large percentage of
disorder events are due to feedback mechanisms.
On the more local level, C1 and C2, the clusters with the largest number of events, display
similar self-excitatory trends compared to C3 and C4. As can be seen from Table 2 values of α are
larger in C1 and C2 (α = 1.52 and 1.40 events per day, respectively) than in C3 and C4 (α = 0.57
and 0.71 events per day, respectively) however the associated timescales 1/β are less than one
day in C1 and C2 (1/β = 0.5 and 0.6 days, respectively), smaller compared to those observed
for C3 and C4 (1/β = 1.54 and 1.2 days, respectively). These results suggest that C1 and C2 are
marked by more intense, yet more damped feedback activity than C3 and C4. The two opposite
trends lead to relatively uniform branching ratios across clusters with γ ranging from γ = 0.88
(C2) to γ = 0.79 (C1). Of particular interest is C3, the most sparse cluster, as can be seen in Figure
3). This cluster also carries the least number of events (436) and displays the lowest reactivity
yet, it displays the longest timescale, leading to a very large branching ratio γ = 0.88. These
results suggest that although disorder events are rarer in C3, feedback effects are very strong
and echoes of disorder persist the longest. Finally, the background intensity µ is highest in C1
(µ = 0.61 events per day) and smallest in C3 (µ = 0.17 events per day). Overall, one may expect
the emergence of roughly 9 events per day countrywide, with a high likelihood of events being
self-excited; disaggregating trends within the separate clusters shows that most of these events are
to be expected in C2 and C1, and to a lesser degree in C4 and C3. While C3 contributes less than
others to the expected daily disorder count, the degree of self-excitation is strong. Interestingly, C1
and C2 are also the clusters that according to the 2011 Census of India, host the states with the
most dense population: Uttar Pradesh in C1 (200 million residents, and a density of 828 persons
per km2 ) and Bihar in C3 (105 million residents, and a density of 1,102 persons per km2 ).

Israel

We apply similar procedures for disorder events in Israel, leading to the four clusters displayed in
Fig. 7. Cluster 1 (C1) groups 792 events occurring in the greater Jerusalem area and in proximity of
the Gaza strip; the second cluster (C2) is located in the southern part of the country, at the border
with Jordan and only counts 220 events. The third cluster (C3) is centered around Tel Aviv, on the
western coast and contains 1073 events. Finally, cluster C4 is located in the Haifa region, in the
northern part of the country, and contains the most number of events, 1446.

Figure 10: Cluster dynamics in Israel: (left) Pearson’s correlation of weekly events n j across pairs of clusters. (right)
Pearson’s correlation of differentiated weekly events ∆n j = n j − n j−1 across pairs of clusters. The color
scale is limited to the 0.95 – 1 range as no lower values of r are found in either case. The left panel shows
almost perfect correlation between weekly-based streams of events for all cluster pairs. The synchrony
remains almost perfect when considering first-order differences in the right. The nationwide correlation that
is much more visible than in India or Mexico may be due to Israel’s more compact geographical extension,
linguistic unity, tighter virtual connectivity, and/or due to the nationwide engagement of the Black Flag
movement.

Figure 8 shows the temporal dynamics across the four clusters in Israel. The overall picture is
sensibly different from what observed in India. Besides scattered events recorded in early 2020,
most weekly events n j are concentrated between week j = 37 (September 6th to September 12th )
and week j = 50 (December 6th to December 12th ), concurrent with nationwide protests organized
by the Black Flag Movement against the alleged corruption of Prime Minister Nethanyahu and
his failures in managing the pandemic. Figure 9 reveals low values of averaged weekly disorders,
16

however many outliers emerge corresponding to the interval between weeks j = 37 and j = 50
mentioned above. The Pearson’s correlation coefficients r comparing weekly {n j } events between
pairs of clusters are shown in Fig. 10 and reveal strong homogeneous, positive synchrony Values
range between r = 0.995 (between C2 and C3, and C2 and C4) and r = 0.999 (between C3 and C4).
Similarly strong, positive relationships persist when considering the first order difference sequence
{∆n j }. This finding underscores that even when considering increasing or decreasing trends,
clusters are tightly aligned, indicating nation-wide synchrony. That this feature emerges with so
much clarity in Israel compared to India may be a consequence of its much smaller territorial
extent, a more linguistically homogenous population, and/or larger access to broadband internet,
but also the result of the Black Flag Movement’s nation-wide campaigns. Numerical values are
listed in Appendix iv.
Table 3 lists all statistical quantities derived from fitting the Hawkes process to the tabulated
disorder events in Israel. As observed for India, the Hawkes process always outperforms the
baseline Poisson process in terms of AIC values. However, the D statistic derived from the KS
analysis is higher than the critical Dff both at the 95% and at the 99% confidence levels, indicating
that more appropriate time-dependent point processes should be used to describe the data. For
example, the extreme clustering that characterizes events in C4 might be better represented by
more rapidly decaying forms than the exponential decay g(t). From Table 3 we also observe that
the 3,531 countrywide events can be described by a Hawkes process with a decaying exponential
function g where α = 23.53 events per day, lasting 1/β = 0.45 days. These values correspond to
a branching ratio γ = 0.97 and indicate that disorders cause strong feedback of short duration.
This is confirmed by Fig. 2 where we observe a very high concentration of events occurring over
a limited timeframe. Clusters C1, C3 and C4 display relatively similar trends: the background
rate µ varies between µ = 0.151 (C4) and µ = 0.265 (C1) events per day, whereas γ ranges from
γ = 0.92 (C1) to γ = 0.97 (C4), indicating relatively low background rates but sustained feedback.
Conversely, C2 reports the largest background rate among all clusters with µ = 0.59 events per
day, the lowest reactivity with α = 4.82 events per day and the largest lifetime 1/β = 0.15 days,
which combine to yield the lowest branching ratio γ = 0.76 of all clusters. On average, the total
number of disorders expected in Israel is µ/(1 − γ) = 13.8 events per day, arising in descending
order in C3, C1 and C2. However, the contribution of C4 cannot be determined since the Hawkes
process may not be the most adequate representation of the local point process distribution in this
cluster.

iii.

Mexico

As for India and Israel, the clustering process yields four clusters in Mexico; they are shown
in Fig.11. Two of them exhibit a sparse nature, with events distributed in a less dense manner
compared to the other two. The first cluster (C1) only contains 139 events that however are
spatially concentrated. This cluster covers the southern part of the country, and includes the states
of Chiapas, Veracruz, Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo. The second cluster (C2) contains a
total of 270 events, mainly located in the states of Durango, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, and Nayarit.
Cluster C3 is the least populated, tallying only 101 events that are spread across the Northern
states, particularly Baja California Sur, Baja California, Sonora, Sinaloa, and Chihuahua. As can be
seen, the vast majority of events (766) are located in C4, which accounts for 60% of total disorders.
C4 contains Mexico City, the country’s capital, as well as the states of Oaxaca, Puebla, Queretaro,
Guanajuato, Michoacan, and Mexico state.
Figure 12 displays cluster trends at the weekly level. Contrary to what observed for India and
Israel, disorder events have mostly persisted throughout the COVID-19 crisis: in Mexico there

Table 3: Statistical outcomes of the Hawkes process applied to data from Israel. The Hawkes process outperforms the
baseline Poisson process both nationwide and in each cluster, since the Hawkes AIC is always less than the
Poisson AIC. The Hawkes process passes the KS test at the 95% significance level in all cases except for C4,
where D > Dc99 , indicating that the hypothesis that the data can be fit to a Hawkes process with a decaying
exponential should not be accepted. Given the nature of the data, a more steeply decaying function than the
decaying exponential should be used in C4.

have been no major interruptions of protests, riots or violence against civilians since the onset of
the pandemic. This may be due to the government never having imposed a complete lockdown
in the country. However, the alignment in peaks of disorder activity across clusters is weak, and
much less pronounced than in India or Israel. For instance, while C4 (the cluster that records the
majority of events) shows sustained activity on weeks j = 14 (March 29th to April 4th ), j = 16
(April 12th to April 18th ), and j = 18 (April 26th to May 2nd ). Similar trends are not detected in the
other clusters. For example, in neighboring C2, activity spikes in week j = 19 (May 3rd to May
9th ). Figure 13 summarizes the distribution of events in Mexico at the weekly level. As mentioned,
C4 has the highest average and variability in event counts, followed by C2, whereas in C3 and
C1 fewer events are recorded. Interestingly, C1 is characterized by a very low variability. Thus,
while spikes in activity and fluctuations emerge in other clusters, events in C1 are more uniformly
distributed.
The Pearson’s correlation coefficients r for Mexico and its four clusters are shown in Fig. 14.
Calculations relative to the weekly {n j } events reveal some alignment between clusters, specially
between C2 and C4 (r = 0.826), and to a lesser degree between C3 and C4 (r = 0.772). However,
after computing the correlation coefficient relative to the first order difference sequence {∆n j },
these relationships become much weaker: all positive correlations between weekly counts are
reduced, C3 and C4 display low correlation (r = 0.286) and the value of the coefficients between
C1 and C2 (r = −0.092) and C2 and C3 (r = −0.445) become negative. Numerical values are listed
in Appendix iv.
The statistical results obtained from applying the Hawkes model to Mexico are listed in Table
4. As for India and Israel, the Hawkes process yields better outcomes than the baseline Poisson
process in modeling disorder events related to the COVID-19 pandemic, both nationwide and at
the cluster level. Furthermore, all models fitted with data on Mexico passed the KS test as well,
testifying to the goodness of fit provided by the specific Hawkes formalization of a self-excitability
process. We identify an underlying temporal-dependence among events even in the case of C3,
the cluster with least number of events. Countrywide, the 1, 276 events yield a Hawkes process
marked by reactivity α=2.29 events per day, with a relatively short lifetime of 1/β = 0.41 days. The
branching ratio is γ = 0.79, indicating a considerable amount of self-excitability, although much

less than what observed in India and Israel. Among the various clusters, the greatest reactivity is
observed in C4 with α=1.66, decreasing in other clusters until a minimum of α=0.10 events per
day is reached in C3; C1 is also the cluster where the longest lifetime of self-excitatory phenomena
is observed, with 1/β= 6.88 days whereas the shortest is in C4 where 1/β = 0.44 days. Overall,
the cluster values of α, β yield sensibly lower values of γ compared to India and Israel, ranging
from γ = 0.54 (C2) to γ = 0.73 (C4) and confirming the nationwide trend. The background rate µ
ranges from µ = 0.774 (C4) to µ = 0.121 (C3) events per day. Combined, these results imply that

Discussion and Conclusion

We studied COVID-19 disorder events by using a public database compiled by the CDT initiative
promoted by ACLED, the most reliable and complete source of data on conflicts and disorder

Table 4: Statistical outcomes of the Hawkes process applied to data from Mexico. The Hawkes process outperforms the
baseline Poisson process both nationwide and in each cluster, since the Hawkes AIC is always less than the

of demonstrations in the three countries with the highest number of events i.e., India, Israel,
and Mexico between January 3rd and December 12th 2020. Using the well known Hawkes point
process we investigated whether self-exciting effects could arise across events. We first considered
countrywide data and later identified distinct geographical clusters in each of the three countries,
to investigate trends on the more local level. Our intent was to better understand the macro- and
meso-scale mechanisms that govern disorder events occurring in the same general context (the
pandemic) but that may be ignited, shaped, acerbated or placated by more local happenings. Our
work is in line with other empirical studies related to social tension, nucleated by the seminal
work of M. I. Midlarsky [38] and that include analyses of the 2011 London riots [6, 15], and of the
2005 Paris riots [9].
We identified four geographical clusters in each of the the countries we investigated by
employing k-means clustering, These hosted varying numbers of events, were of varying spatial
extent, and mostly followed clear geographical separations. We observed self-excitatory effects in
all countries and in almost all subnational clusters, and found that the time-dependent Hawkes
process is always a better fit to the disorder data than a simple Poisson process. We also performed
several robustness checks, such as modifying the random number generator, or considering shorter
time windows (see Appendix v); the number of clusters, and the applicability of the Hawkes
process persisted in all cases. These results show that temporal dependence and self-excitability at
the national level are not the result of the superimposition of unstructured, random processes at
the subnational level. Instead, disorder events naturally cluster already at the local level, regardless
of cluster size, and country examined.
However, while the temporal dependency between events, a hallmark of the Hawkes process,
represents a common feature of protests, riots, and similar events related to the COVID-19
pandemic, important differences in the magnitude of these dependencies arise both intra- and
inter-country. The three parameters that define the conditional intensity function of the Hawkes
processes, i.e. the background rate µ, the reactivity α, the dcay rate β, as well as other derived
quantities such as the branching ratio γ and the average expected intensity E[λ(t)], report a wide
heterogeneity. This may be due to local infectivity trends, local decision-making, and how the
pandemic and the associated measures impacted local calendars of religious or public holidays.
The distribution of disorder events in Mexico for instance, does not display large variations
between March and October 2020; in India, although the frequency of disorders has always

21

remained relatively large starting in April 2020, major spikes emerged in May 2020 and between
June and July 2020. Israel, finally, displays an even more extreme situation: a handful of events
were recorded in March 2020, but intense protesting occurred between September and October
2020. As a result of the relatively homogenous temporal trend, Mexico is associated with the
largest background intensity µ; reactivity α on the other hand is largest in Israel, the country which
also displays the shortest duration of an excitation β−1 . In Israel, the influence of an event lasts for
β−1 = 0.04 days, ten times less than in India and Mexico where β−1 = 0.46 and β−1 = 0.41 days,
respectively, The more homogeneous course of events in Mexico is also manifest in the lowest
branching factor, γ = 0.791, compared to India and Israel (γ = 0.946, γ = 0.972), implying that the
probability that an event is endogenously generated as a consequence of another event is lowest in
Mexico. Among the social and political events driving these patterns are the lack of a complete
lockdown in Mexico, large scale protests in Israel as organized by the Black Flag Movement, the
more compact geography and stronger internet connectivity in Israel compared to Mexico and
India, which are also more linguistically and culturally heterogeneous. In all cases, the highest
reactivity α emerges at the national scale, conversely, the average number of days upon which
events may excite others is always highest in subnational clusters.
Our work comes with some limitations. First, a more systematic approach to assess temporal
dependence and self-excitability on the global scale is needed, especially considering the risk of
prolonged restrictive measures during national vaccination campaigns. Although India, Israel, and
Mexico report the highest number of disorders, they represent a small fraction of the countries in
which disorders have occurred. Evaluating whether temporal clustering is a universal characteristic
would help advance our knowledge on human behavior under prolonged periods of duress, and
under greater social and cultural diversity. Furthermore, we did not distinguish events based upon
their nature (e.g., protests vs. violence against civilians), motives (e.g., protests against restrictions
imposed by the government vs. protests against the lack of supplies for health care workers; or
participant type (migrant workers vs. students). As mentioned, the vast majority of events in India,
Israel and Mexico, have been peaceful protests, however the dataset we utilized did not allow for
a clear stratification of motives or participant type. Disentangling the distinct mechanisms that
trigger self-excitability based on the qualitative features of the event themselves and the demands
participants carry, would greatly add to our understanding of how social unrest unfolds.
Notwithstanding, our work shows that analyzing disorders at the national and subnational
scales is useful. A national focus allows to understand higher-level dynamics that transcend
physical distances, especially in the current era of unprecedentedly fast information (and disinformation) spread. Social-media and other forms of long-distance connectivity can facilitate
the dissemination of government decisions but also help large scale planning of nationwide or
even international disorders. Understanding subnational dynamics allows for a more nuanced
picture as local streams of protests may be ignited by more local issues. The global nature of the
pandemic does not imply that its impacts are homogeneously distributed; to the contrary, existing
socio-economic contexts lead to heterogeneous responses to the unfolding and management of
the crisis. Decisions taken may resonate differently in different communities, which may be more
or less concerned with the restriction of individual freedoms, being able to provide for one’s
livelihood, or prevent authoritarianism, and this may lead to localized waves of disorders, with
a diverse composition of participants. Finally, our work underscores the need to align citizen
trust with governmental decisions, especially at the local level, so that the implementation of
restrictions and other public health measures are perceived to be temporary and in the interest
of the common good, and that appropriate supporting policies are promoted to ensure the least
economic disruption and uncertainty.

Appendix

ACLED event types

In this Appendix we illustrate the various categories the ACLED codebook uses to classify disorder
events [1]:
Violence against civilians involve one organized armed group deliberately inflicting violence
against unarmed non-combatants. Perpetrators of violent acts can include state forces and affiliates,
rebels, militias or other marginal subjects. Attempts to inflicting harm are also included, such as
attempted kidnappings.
Riots are characterized by demonstrators or mobs engaging in violent, disruptive actions such as
property destruction. Riots can emerge from peaceful protests and are generally characterized by
the use of unsophisticated weapons.
Protests refer to public demonstrations involving participants that do not engage in violent activity,
although violence may be used against them. Symbolic acts such as publicly displaying flags are
not coded as protests if they are not accompanied by a demonstration. Parliamentary walkouts
and/or individual acts such as self-harming are not included.
Battles involve violent interactions between politically organized armed groups at a particular
time and location. At least two armed actors must be present; these may be armed and may
include state, non-state and external entities. There is no minimum threshold for the number of
fatalities.

k-means clustering

The purpose of k-means clustering is to partition a set of n points { x1 , · · · , xn } into k clusters
C1 , · · · , Ck [25]. This iterative algorithm seeks to identify clusters Ci by considering their centroids
νi and by minimizing the average distance of the data points within it to the centroid. Therefore,
the k-means algorithm tries to find C = {C1 , · · · , Ck } and νi defined as
k

arg min ∑
C

∑

k x − νi k2

(S1)

i =1 x ∈Ci

Here, k x − νi k2 is the square of the Euclidean distance between the points in a given cluster and
its centroid νi . Procedurally, k centroids νi are initialized and each data point is assigned to its
closest centroid. The mean of the positions of all points within a cluster define the new centroid.
An iterative process ensues until discrepancies between iterations falls below a given threshold.
ii.1

Finding the optimal number of k

To identify the optimal number of clusters k∗ we utilized the heuristic elbow method. Here,
k-means clustering is applied for several increasing values of k. Once clusters are identified, the
sums of the square of the distance of each point within a cluster to its centroid is calculated.
This k-dependent quantity is termed WSS(k), within-cluster sum. As k increases, more clusters
are possible, hence, one may expect the WSS(k) to decrease as a function of k as there may be
a centroid closer to them. However, beyond a critical value k∗ the decrease may be marginal,
indicating that allowing for extra clusters does not improve on the compactness of the clustering
process. The value of k∗ beyond which decreases in WSS asymptote yields the elbow, optimal

Hawkes Process parameter estimation

We use MLE to derive the Hawkes process parameters µ, α, β. These emerge as the ones that
maximize the loglikelihood function defined as

where {t1 , ..., tn } is the set of the times of occurrence of given events. The loglikelihood function
compares the value of the intensity function of the Hawkes process λ(t) at event times {t1 , ..., tn }
to the cumulative value of the function within the continuous interval 0 ≤ t ≤ tn . Maximizing the
loglikelihood function yields parameters which best represent the actual event data. In this work
we maximize logL through the Nelder-Mead approach as available in the ptproc package in R
[45].

Cluster-based analysis: Pearson’s correlation coefficients

In this section we list the numerical values of the Pearson coefficient r correlating the number of
weekly of events in pairs of clusters within a given country. If we denote two clusters within a
country CX and CY then r is defined as

r=

E ( X − µ x ) E (Y − µ y )
σX σY

(S3)

28

where X, Y are the sets of weekly data in clusters CX and CY , respectively, µ X , µY their averages,
and σX , σY their standard deviations. Pearson’s correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1; r = 1
implies a perfect, positive, linear relationship between the two datasets whereas r = −1 implies
a perfect negative one. As |r | decreases, correlations become weaker, so that r = 0 implies data
points in the two sets X, Y are not correlated. In our work, X, Y are the either the sets of weekly

geographically contiguous clusters C2 and C4. The lowest r = 0.571 is observed between clusters C2 and
C4. Bottom: Entries represent correlation coefficients r derived on differentiated weekly events {∆n j } show
vanishing or even negative correlation and implying lack of synchrony in the rate of change of the occurrence
of events.

Table 4: Statistical outcomes of the Hawkes process applied to data from India up to October 10th, 2020. The Hawkes
process outperforms the baseline Poisson process both nationwide and in each cluster, since the Hawkes AIC is
always less than the Poisson AIC. The Hawkes process passes the KS test at the 95% significance level in all
cases.
