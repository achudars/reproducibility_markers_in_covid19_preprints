Abstract

Policy-makers require data-driven tools to assess the spread of COVID-19 and inform the public of their risk of
infection on an ongoing basis. We propose a rigorous hybrid model-and-data-driven approach to risk scoring based
on a time-varying SIR epidemic model that ultimately yields a simplified color-coded risk level for each community.
The risk score Γt that we propose is proportional to the probability of someone currently healthy getting infected
in the next 24 hours. We show how this risk score can be estimated using another useful metric of infection spread,
Rt , the time-varying average reproduction number which indicates the average number of individuals an infected
person would infect in turn. The proposed approach also allows for quantification of uncertainty in the estimates
of Rt and Γt in the form of confidence intervals. Code and data from our effort have been open-sourced and are
being applied to assess and communicate the risk of infection in the City and County of Los Angeles.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic has forced governments and public authorities to employ stringent
measures [1], [2], including closing business and implementing stay-at-home orders, to contain the spread.
When making such decisions, policymakers require tools to understand in “real-time” how the virus is
spreading in the community, as well as tools to help communicate the level of risk to citizens so that they
can be encouraged to take appropriate measures and take the public health directives seriously.
One metric that has been found to be useful for authorities to assess the level of containment over time
is the effective reproduction number [3]. The effective reproduction number, Rt , indicates on average how
many currently susceptible persons can be infected by a currently infected individual. The epidemic grows
if this measure is above one. It is desirable to keep this value as far below one as possible over time in
order to contain and eventually, hopefully, eliminate the virus from the community.
While Rt is meaningful to understand the rate at which the epidemic is spreading and has been proposed
previously (for example, see https://rt.live/ ), what has been missing in the public discourse is a risk metric
that is more suitable for communication to a wider public. One key requirement for such a metric is that
it be something that a citizen could relate to on an individual basis. Another requirement is that it needs
to be easy to communicate to a wide audience. We address both these requirements in this work and
make the following contributions.
First, we obtain the daily effective reproduction number Rt of a time-varying SIR model as well as the
corresponding confidence Interval. The confidence interval reflects uncertainty in both the parameter of
the underlying model and uncertainty in the data itself. Further, we present the mathematical derivation
of the distribution of Rt .

Fig. 1: Overview of Our System.
Second, we propose a novel risk score Γt for a community that is proportional to the probability
that an individual will get infected in the next 24 hours. We show that the risk score can be calculated
given estimates of four quantities: a) an estimate of Irep,new (t), the most recently reported count of new
confirmed infectious cases, b) an estimate of Rt as discussed above, c) an estimate of K, the ratio of
true infectious cases to the number of confirmed cases, and d) an estimate of S(t), the current number
of susceptible individuals in the community. To make the score more meaningful, we normalize the
probability of infection by multiplying it by 10,000. Then, a risk score of x is an indication that there is,
on average, a chance of x in 10,000 of an individual in the community becoming infected in the next 24
hours.
Third, we propose to convert the numerical risk score, which has an intuitive meaning as indicated above,
to a color-coded risk level based on suitably chosen thresholds. We propose the use of four color-levels
to indicate the corresponding risk level from low to high: green, yellow, orange, and red.
Fourth, we have implemented software to estimate the risk level for any community and released it
as open-source. The code requires only time-series data on confirmed new cases, the population of the
community, and an estimate for the ratio of true to confirmed (detected) COVID-19 positive cases. This
software is being used at USC to process the daily data of communities within Los Angeles County to
estimate and generate maps of risk levels by community. The block diagram in figure 1 illustrates key
elements of our system design. Our data parser is able to get the raw data from online data sources, clean
them up and store them in machine-friendly (csv and json) formats. Our code for infection risk calculation
uses this data in conjunction with a time-varying SIR-based Bayesian mathematical model to obtain risk
estimates and prediction for different communities. The results are provided in CSV format and can be
used to generate a heatmap-type visualization as well.
The risk scoring model we describe in this work is now being used by the City of Los Angeles, which
in turn is working with the County of Los Angeles and other partners to develop a publicly accessible
tool that can be used by individuals and communities to grow awareness and mitigate risk of infection.
We believe that our risk estimation approach will be similarly of value to other communities around the
world.
II. R ELATED W ORK
As noted above, the calculation of the risk score requires an estimate of Rt . We show how this can
be estimated using a time-varying SIR model, a generalization of the well-known SIR compartmental
model [4], [5] which consists of three states, namely the susceptible state, the infected state, and the
recovered state. While traditionally this model is assumed to have a interaction rate / infection rate
parameter that is constant, one recent work has used a time-varying SIR model to recover the time-varying
effective reproduction number [6]. Going beyond that work, we also show how to derive a confidence
interval for Rt in this work. Further, the authors of [6] make strong assumptions on the number of

susceptible individuals by approximating it as a constant factor of the entire population. This assumption
may not be accurate when the number of infected individuals are high compared to the total population
of a community; we therefore take a more general approach.
Another recent work by Systrom [7] has presented a Bayesian prediction approach to obtain confidence
intervals for Rt . However, Systrom’s work builds on [8], where the definition of infection rate Rt is not
based on a time-varying contact rate of the SIR model. Instead, their approach estimates infection rate
probabilistically based on the number of new cases alone.
We are not aware of prior work that has proposed defining risk for COVID-19 or other epidemics in
terms of an individual’s probability of infection, which we argue is more meaningful for communicating
risk to the public.
III. M ETHODOLOGY
Compartmental mathematical models for epidemic spreads including the well-known SIR model have
been used since the work of Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 [4]. In the SIR model, each member of
a given population is in one of three states at any time: susceptible, infectious, recovered. Any individual
that is susceptible could become infected with some probability when they come into contact with an
infected individual. Any individual that is infectious eventually recovers (in the context of COVID-19
when applying the SIR model, note that the category of recovered individuals will also include removed
individuals due to deaths, which could be modeled as a constant fraction of all individuals in this category).
In the classical SIR model, the number of susceptible individuals that become infected depends on the rate
at which infected and susceptible individuals encounter each other and this rate is assumed to be constant.
A well-known parameter in the classical SIR model is called R0, the effective reproductive number,
which measures the average number of infections caused by infectious individuals at the beginning of the
epidemic.
A. Time-Varying SIR model and Rt
In our work, we have extended the SIR model to a time-varying model, in which the rate of encounters
and infection probability between individuals in the population is assumed to be time-varying. This better
reflects the reality of our present epidemic where interventions such as stay-at-home have been put in
place and relaxed and various times and compliance with recommendations such as wearing masks and
maintaining physical density has also been time-varying. Based on this model, we are able to define and
derive a new approach to calculating a time-varying version of the effective reproductive number, which
we refer to as Rt .
A particularly innovative aspect of our model is that it is a Bayesian model that allows the incorporation
of various sources of uncertainty in the model, including uncertainty in the actual numbers of infected
individuals (due to not every infected individual having been tested, as studies [2] have shown), uncertainty
in recovery times, and uncertainty in the choice of parameters for de-noising the empirical data. This allows
us to generate not only an estimate of Rt , but also quantify confidence in the estimate from a rigorous
statistical perspective.
In this section, we elaborate upon the SIR model in detail. The SIR model is one of the simplest and
the most well-known epidemic model [4], [5] where each person belongs to one of the following three
states: the susceptible state, the infected state, and the recovered state. Regarding the susceptible state,
individuals have not had the virus yet. However, they may get infected in case of being exposed to an
infected individual. As far as the infected state is concerned, a susceptible person has the virus after
being exposed to infected individuals. Finally, a person enters the recovered state in case of either the
individual gets healed or dies. One important point about this model is that a recovered person will not
be a susceptible one anymore.

The SIR model follows the following differential equations:
S(t)I(t)
dS(t)
= −β
dt
N
dI(t)
S(t)I(t)
=β
− σI(t)
dt
N
dR(t)
= σI(t)
dt

(1)

where S(t), I(t), and R(t) respectively represent the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered people
in a population size of N at time t. Regarding the parameter σ, it is the recovery rate after being infected
and is equal to D1I where DI represents the average infectious days. Parameter β is known as the effective
contact rate, i.e. the average number of contacts an individual have with others is β.
In analyzing whether any pandemic is contained, it is very crucial to obtain parameter β. We next show
that how we can derive β from the aforementioned differential equations.
1) Obtaining βt and Rt for the SIR Model: In the SIR model, we can express the number of
susceptible individuals in terms of population size and the number of infected persons as S(t) ≈ N −I(t).
By replacing S(t) with N − I(t) in the second differential equation of (1), we would have
(N − I(t))I(t)
dI(t)
=β
− σI(t).
dt
N

(2)

We can rewrite (2) as follows:
dI(t)
(β − σ)I(t) −

β 2
N I (t)

= dt.

(3)

By taking definite integral from time t1 to t2 and assuming β to be constant in this time interval, we
would have
Z t2

(β − σ)I(t) −

One can easily check (5) has a unique solution for β due to the fact that term β−σ
and log term have
monotonic behaviors.

> 0, or

consequently

(6)

In the early stage of an epidemic, almost everyone are susceptible except very few cases. Therefore,
N − I(t) ≈ N and as a result, condition (6) would turn into βσ > 1.
The variable R , βσ is defined as the effective reproduction number. It is a useful metric to determine
epidemic growth. In case of having R > 1, the epidemic is growing exponentially while R < 1 indicates
the epidemic is contained and will decline and die out eventually.
For discrete-time cases such as daily reporting on number of infected cases, the time-variant effective
contact rate βt , which represents the contact rate for time slot t can be derived by solving the following
equation:
I(t + 1)
1
I(t)
( log
− log
) = 1 ∀t.
βt
βt − σ
βt − σ − N I(t + 1)
βt − σ − βNt I(t)

(7)

Therefore, the time-variant effective reproduction number would be defined as Rt , βσt . Since it is difficult
to write a closed form solution for βt in (7), we take a simpler approximation to βt by considering the
following which is based on (2)
βt ≈

Then, we estimate Rt as

βt

2) Obtaining the Confidence Interval for Rt : Since there is uncertainty about parameter DI (or
equivalently σ) and the number of infected cases I(t), we now provide the derivation of confidence interval
for parameter Rt . Regarding modeling the ambiguity in the number of the infected cases, we present the
uncertainty about the actual number of infected cases as a factor of reported ones, i.e. Irep (t) , K1 I(t),
and K is a constant greater than 1. The main intuition behind this factor is due to taking into account
the following two phenomena, namely lack of sufficient number of tests (specially in the beginning of
the pandemic) and asymptomatic cases (mild infections which might not even be noticed).
To derive the confidence interval, we need to first find the marginal distribution of Rt . By considering
fD (d) and fK (k) as the probability distribution function (pdf) for parameters DI and K, respectively, the
joint pdf of these parameters would be
fD,K (d, k) = fD (d)fK (k)

(9)

due to the independence of DI and K. We can derive the probability distribution function of Rt by
performing the following transformation on parameters DI and K and introducing auxiliary variable Z:

3) Estimating the Risk Score: We propose a novel risk score metric for a given community that is
proportional to the probability of someone in that community becoming infected in the next time period
(typically, 24 hours). The risk score can be derived as the average number of people in that community
that are likely to get infected in the next 24 hours by the currently infectious people divided by the current
number of susceptible individuals. We further normalize this probability by multiplying by 10,000, so that
a score of 1 implies a 1 in 10,000 chance of getting infected, a score of 2 implies a 2 in 10,000 chance
of getting infected, and so on. Mathematically, the risk score is defined as follows:
fRt (r) =

K · Irep,new (t) · Rt
I(t) · Rt
· 10000 ≈
· 10000,
DI · S(t)
N

(18)

where Irep,new (t) indicates the most recently reported count of new confirmed infectious cases, K refers
to the ratio of true cases to reported cases, Rt is the time-varying reproduction number, and N is the total
population size of the community. The approximation follows from the fact that Irep,new (t) is approximately
equal to DI(t)
and S(t) the number of susceptible people in the community is approximately equal to N in
I ·K
the early stages of the epidemic. Confidence intervals for the risk score Γt could be obtained numerically
using a similar process as described for Rt accounting also for uncertainty in K. Note that since K may
not be known for a given community, it may be helpful to use the following normalized form of the risk
score: ΓKt , which is still proportional to the probability of infection for an individual.
4) Color-coded Risk Levels: To further simplify the presentation of the risk score to a wider audience,
we propose to classify the risk levels into four color-coded levels: (Green, Yellow, Orange, Red). The
risk level is determined by evaluating the normalized risk score ( KΓ ) with respect to three pre-specified
threshold levels θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , such that when KΓ < θ1 the risk level is green, when θ1 ≤ KΓ < θ2 the risk level
is yellow, when θ2 ≤ KΓ < θ3 the risk level is orange, and when KΓ ≥ θ3 the risk level is red.

Fig. 2: Plots a) and b) respectively represent the estimated effective reproduction number Rt and the risk
score Γt over time for the entire county of LA considering E[DI ] = 7.5, V ar[DI ] = 9, E[K] = 3, and
V ar[K] = 0.44. The gray area represents the 95% confidence interval in the estimates.

Fig. 3: Estimate of risk score Γt over time for four representative communities in LA County: Boyle
Heights, Glendale, East LA, and Norwalk. Regarding the settings, we considered the following E[DI ] =
7.5, V ar[DI ] = 9, E[K] = 3, and V ar[K] = 0.44. Our approach also yields uncertainty in the estimate,
as shown in the form of confidence intervals (in gray).
IV. I MPLEMENTATION AND E VALUATION IN L OS A NGELES C OUNTY
The software for data collection, infection rate estimation and prediction has already been implemented
and made available as open-source software (at the following repository: https://github.com/ANRGUSC/
covid19 risk estimation). The software is written in Python using standard data processing libraries such
as NumPy and SciPy.
A. Data Sources
We have acquired COVID-19 case data from the LA County’s Department of Public Health using a
Python-based data parser we wrote (open-sourced at the following link: https://github.com/ANRGUSC/
lacounty covid19 data). We have been updating this repository regularly with the latest data every day
since mid-march and also making available plots of the number of cases, number of fatalities, top 6
communities with the large number of cases, infection rate for the entire LA County, and the top 9
communities with the highest infection rate at the following link: http://anrg.usc.edu/www/covid19.html.
The following data sources are used for the infection rate and prediction:
• The CoVID-19 case information was collected through LA County’s daily press releases (Accessible
through the following website: http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/).
• Recovery information provided by the World Health Organization.
• The population data from LA County Census is available online (from lacounty.gov/government/
geography-statistics/cities-and-communities/).
B. Real-world Usage
The City of Los Angeles is currently using the risk model described in this work that has been developed
by researchers at USC, to help assess location-based risk for COVID-19 infection. The City is working
with the County and other partners to develop a tool that is publicly accessible and can be used by
individuals and communities to mitigate risk of infection. The goal is to change behaviors to reduce risk
of infection and promote a greater understanding of factors that increase COVID risk. A color-coded
COVID-19 threat level tool that can be used by citizens has also been unveiled by the Mayor of the City
of LA, online at https://corona-virus.la/covid-19-threat-level.

Fig. 4: Maps showing the estimated risk score for different LA County Communities on different dates
since mid-March 2020. Top row: 3/23/20, 4/10/20, 4/27/20; Bottom row: 5/15/20, 6/18/20, 7/1/20
V. E VALUATION R ESULTS
We present below plots from our analysis of LA County community case data using the estimation
approach described in this work. Figure 2 shows plots of the estimated expected reproductive number Rt
and the estimated risk score for the entire LA county. These plots are based on a 14-day moving average
applied on the daily number of confirmed cases. In accordance with LA county daily press releases, there
is a sharp jump in both Rt and risk score around the beginning of July. Note that the reason the risk
score during the beginning of July is higher than the risk score during the last week of March, despite
having the same Rt , is due to the fact that there are significantly more confirmed cases in July compared
to March. Figure 3 shows the risk score estimates over time for four representative communities within
the LA County. Figure 4 shows the color-coded risk levels for communities in LA County for select dates
over the past 3 months.
VI. C ONCLUSION
We have proposed a new risk metric Γt that can be used by individuals in any community to assess
their probability of getting infected by COVID-19. The metric builds on the estimation of Rt , the average
reproductive number, which is obtained from a time-varying extension of the classical SIR model. We
show how to evaluate the uncertainty in both metrics as well. In future work, we plan to generalize the
approach to the SEIR model, which also models an additional incubation period. We have released code
to implement an estimation of the risk score that can be used for any community worldwide as long as
time-series data for confirmed new cases and the population are known. We have also proposed the use
of simple color-coded risk levels to inform and guide the public, as has been adopted in the City of Los
Angeles.
