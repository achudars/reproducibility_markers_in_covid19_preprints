The infection of respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) starts with the upper
respiratory tract and as the virus grows, the infection can progress to lungs and develop
pneumonia. The conventional way of COVID-19 diagnosis is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is less sensitive during early stages; especially
if the patient is asymptomatic, which may further cause more severe pneumonia. In
this context, several deep learning models have been proposed to identify pulmonary
infections using publicly available chest X-ray (CXR) image datasets for early diagnosis,
better treatment and quick cure. In these datasets, presence of less number of COVID-19
positive samples compared to other classes (normal, pneumonia and Tuberculosis) raises
the challenge for unbiased learning of deep learning models. All deep learning models
opted class balancing techniques to solve this issue; which however should be avoided
in any medical diagnosis process. Moreover, the deep learning models are also data
hungry and need massive computation resources. Therefore for quicker diagnosis, this
research proposes a novel pinball loss function based one-class support vector machine
(PB-OCSVM), that can work in presence of limited COVID-19 positive CXR samples
with objectives to maximize the learning efficiency and to minimize the false predictions.
The performance of the proposed model is compared with conventional OCSVM and existing deep learning models, and the experimental results prove that the proposed model
outperformed over state-of-the-art methods. To validate the robustness of the proposed
model, experiments are also performed with noisy CXR images and UCI benchmark
datasets.

1. Introduction
The respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is the most recently identified

member of the coronavirus family [36]. This deadly disease was initially reported
during late December, 2020 and spread to all the countries worldwide [38]. World
health organization (WHO) declared this infectious disease as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020 as it reached to many
countries [43] and on Feb 11, 2020 named it “COVID-19”. On March 11, 2020
WHO declared this a pandemic [44]. After the fourteen months journey, this virus
caused over 160.5 million infections and more than 3.3 million deaths worldwide till
May 12, 2021 [16]. This fatal disease is highly infectious and to control its spread,
following three ways have been suggested as most promising preventive measures:
social distancing [32], use of mask [8] and early identification of infected people. The
social distancing and mask are the established preventive measures that people are
strictly following, but early diagnosis is still a challenge to the research community. COVID-19 is highly infectious, thus the active patient must be quarantined
to break the chain of infection. The best known method of COVID-19 diagnosis
is real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that came
into effect after the rapid antibody tests showed unreliable results, because antibodies appear after 9-28 days of the infection and by this time, an infected person
may spread the disease, if not isolated [7]. The RT-PCR test is a costly and time
taking process, whereas inability to early-stage diagnosis and due to rapid growth
of infections, medical experts are continuously trying to search some other ways of
diagnosis.
SARS-CoV-2 virus initially affects the respiratory system of the infected person
and in later stages, it affects lungs that may cause severe pneumonia [12]. Statistics
show that ∼14% of the COVID-19 patients have shortness of breath and severe
cough due to pneumonia, because as the viral infection increases, it damages the
alveoli (small air sacs) and surrounding tissues. It is evident that the symptoms
of COVID-19 are extremely heterogeneous, ranging from minimal symptoms to
significant hypoxia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [25]. Like flu,
the common early symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, nausea, diarrhea,
muscle aches, vomiting, headache, loss of smell or taste, sore throat, etc. COVID-19
starts affecting the lungs as soon as it reaches through the nose or throat. Statistics
show that 40%-45% of COVID-19 patients remain asymptomatic, but the virus
affects their respiratory system silently and resulting in severe pneumonia.
Aiming to the diagnosis at initial stage; especially for asymptomatic patients,
chest imaging may play a key role because the COVID-19 pneumonia is different
from normal pneumonia and tuberculosis [31]. Although for lung-related disease
diagnosis, chest CT imaging has been proven more effective, the CXR is preferred
because comparatively it is widely available, faster and cheaper. Biomedical image
segmentation and classification have become admired areas of research to make the
present healthcare system more robust and responsive [2, 6]. In this context, the
computing infrastructure advancements make it possible to apply the deep network
approaches for complex biomedical image analysis tasks and especially, variants of

convolution neural networks (CNN) are found very effective and efficient feature
learning approaches in the field of biomedical image analysis [24, 40].
Recently, several deep-learning based COVID-19 detection techniques have been
proposed [31] using collection of pneumonia CXR images from different datasets
[10], [18], [27], [37]. The limited availability of COVID-19 positive samples may lead
to biased outcome therefore, oversampling is opted as a solution by state-of-theart deep learning approaches. The oversampling of medical images is not always
a good practice to increase the classification accuracy, hence the present paper
proposes a novel one-class classification (OCC) approach for COVID-19 diagnosis
in the presence of a limited number of COVID-19 positive training samples. The
identification of COVID-19 infection or pneumonia in CXR images is an anomaly
detection task, which is specifically an one-class classification problem. It is evident
that OCSVCs (support vector data description (SVDD) and OCSVM) are more
suitable for anomaly/novelty detection tasks, where the negative class samples are
totally absent [3]. The OCSVCs are very sensitive to the noise, therefore the present
research proposes an extended version of OCSVM [34] under the supervision of
pinball loss function [17], named as PB-OCSVM. In present research work, CXR
images of COVID-19 [10], radiological society of North America (RSNA) images [37]
and U.S. national library of medicine (USNLM) collected montgomery country NLM(MC) [19] datasets are utilized for experiments to justify the workability of
proposed model. For experiments it is assumed that only COVID-19 infected CXR
images are available for training, whereas other type of pneumonia and normal
CXR images are totally absent at the time of training. The proposed PB-OCSVM
possesses the following advantages:
• It is less sensitive to the noise compared to conventional OCSVM.
• Its computational complexity is nearly equal to the conventional OCSVM,
because pinball loss function does not add any extra computation overhead.
• PB-OCSVM reduces to the original OCSVM when pinball loss parameter
tend to ‘1’, and thus OCSVM can be considered as a special case of the
proposed PB-OCSVM.
• PB-OCSVM computes a hyperplane similar to original OCSVM.
The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the recent
research contributions and Section 3 describes the utilized datasets. The proposed
methodology is discussed in Section 4 whereas the experiments and results are discussed in Section 5. Finally, the concluding remarks and future aspects are discussed
in Section 6.
2. Related work
CXR images are always preferred for disease diagnosis due to wide availability and
easy handling of X-ray machines. As discussed in the preceding section, the conventional way of testing COVID-19 via RT-PCR technique is a time taking and error

prone process, especially for asymptomatic patients. Hence, the CXR image analysis is claimed to be a more robust alternate way to diagnose COVID-19. Concerning
the same, several binary and multi-class classifications based deep learning models
have been reported using collection of multiple CXR datasets [10], [18], [27], [37]
with a common objective to develop a fully automatic diagnosis system, because
the manual analysis is a time consuming process and require radiology experts.
In this context, it is also evident with deep insight into literature that one-class
classification approaches are not yet explored. The present research considers the
diagnosis of COVID-19 infection as an anomaly or novelty detection task and proposes a novel variant of OCSVM named pin-ball OCSVM (PB-OCSVM), capable
to work with limited number of training samples and robust against the noise. The
proposed approach eliminates the need of oversampling of original samples as preferred by all deep learning approaches. This section gives comprehensive review of
the most recently proposed deep learning approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis using
CXR images.

2.1. Deep learning approaches
In the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are continuously proposing artificial intelligence (AI) based quicker and alternate approaches to identify
COVID-19 infection from CXR images. It is evident with deep insight into recent
COVID-19 related publications that deep learning models are capable to diagnose
infections using CXR images, that supplant the conventional testing methods and
helpful to reduce the growing burden on radiologists during this pandemic. It is
also true that there is always a chance of infection while collecting samples for swab
test, whereas CXR analysis is comparatively safer and easily manageable. Seeking
to identify COVID-19 infection using CXR images, Narin et al. [26] proposed deep
CNN based ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2 pre-trained transfer
models. Later, Apostolopoulos et al. [4] applied state-of-the-art CNN architectures
based on transfer learning approaches for CXR image classification and for experiments, two different datasets have been used where images belong to three different
categories: COVID-19, viral/bacterial pneumonia and normal cases. In the race
of COVID-19 diagnosis, Khalifa et al. [20] offered generative adversarial network
(GAN) based approach using CXR images while ensuring the robustness against
the over-fitting by generating more images. The utilized dataset contains 5863 CXR
samples of two classes: pneumonia and normal. For experiments, the GoogLeNet,
Squeeznet, Resnet18 and AlexNet deep learning architectures have been experimented along with GAN, where Resnet18 along with GAN outperformed other
models. Further, Sethy et al. [35] introduced deep feature based support vector
machine (SVM) model for COVID-19 infection classification of CXR images. It is
found that SVM outperformed other models with extracted features from ResNet50.
Later, effectiveness of ResNet-50 architecture was proved by Bukhari et al. [5] under
three categories of CXR images: non-COVID pneumonia, normal and COVID-19

pneumonia. The experimental results show that this approach efficiently diagnose
COVID-19 infection.
As an alternate way of COVID-19 infection detection, a customized ResNet-50
CNN based deep learning architecture named ‘COVIDResNet’ has been proposed
[13]. For experiments the input images are progressively resized to 128 × 128 ×
3, 224 × 224 × 3 and 229 × 229 × 3 pixels and the network is fine-tuned at each
stage with automatic learning rate selection, whereas the proposed model attained
higher accuracy with minimum computational complexity. Later, Zhang et al. [46]
proposed a novel deep anomaly detection method for quicker and early diagnosis.
To validate the performance of the proposed approach, CXR images of two different
categories have been considered: COVID-19 positive cases and other pneumonia.
To deal the class imbalance problem in the collected samples, authors proposed a
CXR based COVID-19 screening model through anomaly detection task [30]. Most
recently, Punn and Agarwal [31] proposed a transfer learning based deep learning
architecture for COVID-19 diagnosis, whereas the class imbalance problem was
handled via random oversampling and weighted class approaches have been used.
The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperformed other
state-of-the-art approaches.
Wang et al. [42] proposed a deep CNN for COVID-19 diagnosis called “COVIDNet” and experimented over COVIDx dataset. The proposed COVID-Net was pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and then trained on the COVIDx dataset using
the Adam optimizer. Performance (Multi-class classification) of this approach was
compared with VGG19 and ResNet-50. Afterwards, Yujin et al. [28] proposed a
patch-based ResNet-18 to work with minimum number of trainable parameters,
where a novel probabilistic gradient-weighted class activation map (Grad-CAM)
method was also proposed that takes into account of patch-wise disease probability
in generating global saliency map. The proposed method outperformed COVID-Net
when the task was considered as multi-class classification problem. Later, Afshar et
al. [1] proposed a capsule network based approach for COVID-19 identification from
CXR images and named it COVID-CAPS, where to deal class imbalance problem
more weight is given to positive samples in the modified loss function. Experimental
results show that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art approaches.
In this context, Hall et al. [14] considered COVID-19 identification a binary classification task and proposed an ensemble of the three types of CNN classifiers for
COVID-19 diagnosis. In this approach pre-trained ResNet50 and VGG-16 models
work with a newly proposed small CNN in presence of balanced dataset obtained
by image augmentation.
From above discussion and deep insight into literature, it is evident that almost
all the existing solutions for COVID-19 diagnosis reported till date follow the deep
network architectures. Every deep learning model is data hungry and consumes
massive computing resources as well as time. Hence, a faster diagnosis process
is needed due to the rapid growth of COVID-19 cases and limited availability of
healthcare experts (especially doctors and pathologists). Meanwhile, due to limited

availability of COVID-19 CXR images, class imbalance appears the most critical
issue that has been addressed by all recently proposed approaches with different
solutions. Therefore, a more robust solution is desired, capable of working in the
presence of limited number of positive class samples whereas the other class samples are absent. Naturally, the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases can be formulated as
an anomaly or novelty detection task where only COVID-19 positive samples are
available for training. With this notion, following are the key contributions of the
present research:
•
•
•
•

Formulated the COVID-19 diagnosis as a one-class classification problem.
Only COVID-19 positive CXR images are considered as training samples.
All training and other class samples are treated as test samples.
Performance comparison with recent deep learning approaches is done with
following parameters: accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity and confidence interval.
• Experiments are performed in noisy environment to show the robustness
of the proposed model.
• To show generalization performance of proposed model, 10 benchmark UCI
datasets are also experimented.
3. Dataset Description
In present research, CXR images of COVID-19 [10], radiological society of North
America (RSNA) [37] and U.S. national library of medicine (USNLM) collected
Montgomery country - NLM(MC) [19] datasets are collectively utilized for experiments to compare the performance of proposed method with existing state-ofthe-art approaches. The COVID-19 dataset [10] contains CXR images of following
pneumonia classes: SARSr-CoV-1 (SARS), SARSr-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Pneumocystis spp., Streptococcus spp. and ARDS from multiple public domain resources
available without infringing patient’s confidentiality (Fig. 1 (b)). The dataset includes the statistics up to August 2020 with metadata: patient ID, offset, sex, age,
finding, survival, view, modality, etc. For experiments other samples from COVID19 infected images are considered as another class named as ‘other pneumonia’.
The current version of the dataset is more rich in number of samples and classes,
but to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the older version is used.
Another dataset used in this research has been introduced under RSNA pneumonia diagnose competition, which is a collection of 30,000 images chosen from
the NIH CXR14 dataset [37]. Among these samples, 15,000 images are pneumonia
infected and out of remaining 15,000 samples, 7,500 had no findings whereas other
7,500 had different symptoms from pneumonia. Medical experts and radiologists
annotated these images. Fig. 1(c) shows sample instances. Initially, this dataset
was published with 25,684 training and 1,000 test images and later, the 1000 test
samples were merged to the existing training set to form 26,684 training images
whereas 3,000 new images were introduced as test set. For more robust perfor-

that consists of 138 CXR images of classes: tuberculosis and normal. Table 1 shows
the description of fused dataset used in present research. The dataset is composed of
1214 posteroanterior CXR images with classes: COVID-19 (108), other pneumonia
(515), tuberculosis (58) and normal (533).
4. Proposed approach
From preceding sections, it is inferred that deep learning approaches are playing
a decisive role in advanced biomedical image analysis tasks. Several deep learning
models have been proposed for COVID-19 diagnosis but suffer with following key
issues:
• These models need massive computation power for training.
• Fails to work if samples of only one class (target class) are available for
training. This phenomenon is the motivation of this research.
• May give biased outcome if the dataset suffers with class imbalance problem.
The above issues are identified as the research gap and the present article proposes a one-class classification approach to solve these issues. The conventional
OCSVM (a variant of OCSVCs) and the proposed PB-OCSVM are used as a oneclass classifiers, capable of working with only target class (also known as class of
interest (CoI)) samples. The OCC problem is different from conventional binary
and multi-class classification tasks, where only target class is well defined and the

other class samples are either totally absent or poorly sampled. In present research,
only COVID-19 infected CXR images are used as training samples and the performance evaluation is done in two phases: considering all COVID-19 samples as test
samples and considering other class images as test samples. The aim of the present
research is to ensure maximum learning ability in presence of limited number of
CXR images with minimum false-rejection and false-acceptance. Fig. 2 schematic
of the proposed approach where it is assumed that only the target class samples
are available for training. Initially, data pre-processing is performed to remove the
noise from the images and then the processed images are fed to PB-OCSVM for
training. After training, test samples (in-class and other class samples) are tested.

4.1. Data pre-processing
In this article, COVID-19 infected posteroanterior CXR images of COVID-19
dataset [10] are used to train the PB-OCSVM. For performance evaluation of the
proposed model, the other pneumonia samples from COVID-19 dataset, RSNA [37]
and NLM(MC) [19] datasets are used as test samples along with COVID-19 samples.
The RSNA and NLM(MC) datasets contain samples of pneumonia and tuberculosis respectively along with normal cases. It is evident that the CXR images in
the aggregated dataset suffers with undesired artifacts such as varying resolutions,
pixel level noise, bright texts and unnecessary symbols, hence pre-processing is a
necessary step for further analysis. To overcome from the textual and symbolic
noise, in-painting is performed with the image mask generated using binary thresholding [29] (Eq. 1), whereas image resizing is performed for a fixed size resolution of
331 × 331 × 3 (where 3 is number of channels) to work upon state-of-the-art models.

where for input image i(x, y), the mask is designed with minimum and maximum
threshold values defined as T hmin and T hmax respectively. Even after filtering out
undesired information, there is always a possibility of uncertainty at the deep pixel
level representation [15].
To preserve the original pixel value distribution, following two techniques are
experimented to generate final pre-processed images: the adaptive total variation
method [39] and automatic color equalization (ACE) approach [33]. Images of size
331 × 331 × 3 are used by these methods to generate final images.
4.1.1. Adaptive total variation method
Let, I is a grayscale image and γ is a bounded set over R2 , such that γ ⊂ R2 ,
denoising image D that closely matches to observed image x = (x1 , x2 )  γ - pixels,

where ω(x) = 1+p mod1 Gσ ∗∆D0 , Gσ is the Gaussian kernel, σ is variance , p > 0 is
contrast parameter and * is convolution operator.
4.1.2. Automatic color equalization
This method is based on a computational model of the human visual system that
merges the two basic global equalization mechanisms: “Gray World” (GW) and
“White Patch” (WP). ACE is able to adapt widely varying lighting conditions
and to extract visual information from the environment efficaciously. This is a two
stage process where initially, the GW and WP approaches are merged via a type of
lateral inhibition mechanism, weighted by pixel distance that results in local-global
filtering. Whereas the second stage maximizes the image dynamic via normalizing
the white at a global level.
Let the input image is I with c channels and initially, the chromatic/spatial adjustment produces as output image R in first stage, where every pixel is recomputed
according to the image content. Each pixel p of the output image R is computed
separately for each channel c as follows:

Rc (p) =

X r(Ic (p) − Ic (j))
j6=p

d(p, j)

where Ic (p) − Ic (j) decides the lateral inhibition mechanism, the distance d(.)
weights the amount of local or global contribution and r(.) is the relative lightness appearance of the pixel. Like human visual system, the distance d(.) weights
the global and local filtering effect. Euclidean distance is considered for distance
calculation. Relative pixel influence of each pixel is controlled by r(.) and d(.) for
the spatial channel lightness adjustment. The variation of the slope of the function
r(.) acts as a contrast tuner and in the present research Signum function is used.
Finally, the second stage linearly scales the range of values in Rc independently in
the relative channel c into the range [0; 255] using the formula:
Oc (p) = round[sc Rc (p) − mc ]

(4)

for each pixel p where sc is the slope of the segment [(mc , 0); (Mc , 255)], with Mc =
maxp Rc (p) and mc = minp Rc (p). To make this process more robust, dynamic of
the final image is always centered around the medium gray via means of White
Patch/Gray World (WP/GW) scaling as follows:
Oc (p) = round[127.5 + sc Rc (p)]

(5)

For experiments, Euclidean distance and WP/GW scaling are used and sc is set to
20 for saturation function.
The complete data pre-processing operation is illustrated in Fig. 3, where the
histogram of resulting distributed pixels during every step of pre-processing is also

shown. It is evident that the opted pre-processing approach is capable to eliminate
the irregular intensities while preserving the original nature of the pixel distribution.
After pre-processing of CXR images, intensive experiments are performed with
PB-OCSVM, OCSVM and state-of-the-art deep network models. For PB-OCSVM
and OCSVM, the COVID-19 positive samples are considered as training samples
whereas deep learning models are trained with multi-class samples (80% from each
class) obtained via respective class balancing techniques. For OCC approaches, all
in-class and other class samples are treated as test samples and for deep learning
models all training, remaining in-class and other class samples are treated as test
samples.
4.2. Preliminaries
This section gives brief description of OCSVM, variants of OCSVM with different loss functions and Pinball-SVM. This discussion will help to understand the
formulation of proposed PB-OCSVM.
4.2.1. OCSVM
OCC algorithms are specifically used for anomaly/novelty detection tasks; especially when the non-target class is either ill-defined or totally absent. For unbiased
operation of binary or multi-class classifiers, presence of two well-defined classes is
necessary; but if the test sample belongs to unknown class, the classifier may exhibit
biased behaviour. In such scenarios, OCC techniques are proven as robust solutions,
majorly applicable for concept learning and outliers/novelty detection [21].
Tax et al. [41] proposed a novel OCC model termed as SVDD, where the target
class samples are enclosed by a hypersphere, and the boundary points are called
support vectors. If a data sample falls outside of the hypersphere, SVDD treats it
as outlier and rejects (Fig. 4). The objective function of SVDD is defined as:
L(R, a, αi , γi , ξi ) =R2 + C

subject to: k xi − a k2 ≤ R2 + ξi , where ξi ≥ 0 ∀ i
where radius of the hypersphere is R, xi and a are outlier and center of hypersphere
respectively, the parameter C controls the trade-off between the erros and volume,
and ξ is slack variable to penalizes the outliers. With the Lagrange multipliers
αi ≥ 0, γi ≥ 0 where i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N }, the objective is to minimize R of the
hypersphere while covering all target class samples with some penalty for outliers.
By putting partial derivatives to zero and substituting the constraints into Eq. 6,
following is obtained:

If the description value of a test sample xi is greater than C then it is treated
as an outlier. Kernels can be used to reformulate the SVDD as follows:
2

kφ(x) − ak ≤ R2

(8)

The SVDD outcome can be computed as follows:
2

R2 − kφ(x) − ak

(9)

The output of Eq. 9 is positive for samples inside the boundary and negative for
an outliers.
Later, Schlökopf et al. [34] proposed one-class support vector machine (OCSVM)
as an alternate OCC approach to SVDD, where a hyperplane separates the target
class samples from outliers as shown in Fig. 5. In OCSVM, class of interest (CoI)
samples are separated by a hyperplane with the maximal margin from the origin,
whereas the negative class samples reside in the subspace of the origin. The OCSVM
is defined as following quadratic equation (Eq. 10):

subject to: w.φ(xi ) ≥ ρ − ξi and ξi ≥ 0 ∀ i ∈ {1, 2, . . . n}.
where in feature space the data sample xi is represented by φ and the outlier is
penalized by slack variable ξi . υ  (0,1] decides the lower bound on the number of
support vectors and upper bound on the fraction of outliers.
The dual optimization problem of Eq. 10 is defined as follows:

It is observed that both SVDD and OCSVM perform same with Gaussian kernel
and origin plays a key role because all outliers reside there. Norm of the centre of
SVDD is equal to margin of a hyperplane of OCSVM in unit norm feature space
is [22] as depicted in Fig. 6(a). Thus, reformulation of SVDD can be done by a

In feature space, the virtual hyperplane passes through the origin and the sample
margin is defined by its distance from the image of the data x as shown in Fig. 6(b).
The SVDD’s sample margin is defined as below:
γSV DD (x) =

a.φ(x)
kak

(18)

where γ(x) is the image of data x in feature space and the sample margin of OCSVM
is defined as follows:
γOCSV M (x) =

w.φ(x)
kwk

(19)

Because data samples exist on the surface of a unit hypersphere, the maximum
and minimum value of sample margin is defined as ‘1’ and ‘0’ respectively as follows:
0 ≤ γ(x) ≤ 1

(20)

Also, sample margin of unbounded support vectors xU SV ( 0 <αxU SV < υN
) are
the same as the margin of hyperplane, therefore:

γ(xU SV ) = γSV DD =k a k
γ(xU SV ) = γOCSV M =

In feature space, the distribution of samples is represented by the sample
margiin. Fig. 6(c) shows the distribution of sample margin of training data and
hyperplane of OCSVM in feature space. It is also observed that for RBF kernel
both SVDD and OCSVM perform equally, hence in the present research, OCSVM
is chosen for enhancement with the help of pinball loss function.
4.2.2. OCSVM with other loss functions
For every machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, etc., the loss
functions plays vital role. Consider the training set S = {x1 , x2 , . . . xn } , where
xi ∈ Rn are inputs and target class y is defined as y ∈ {1}. Let, f : Rn →
− R is
a mapping from xi ∈ Rn to y ∈ {1}. During training and testing the predicted
output value of samples is supervised by the associated loss functions.
• OCSVM with hinge loss function:
Like other machine learning tasks the hinge loss for OCSVM [45] is
defined as follows:
Hloss (zi ) = max(0, ρ − zi )

(23)

This unbounded loss function is capable to deal with the shortest distance of the target class samples, but sensitive to the noise. The hinge loss
OCSVM can be written as:
N
1 X
1
k w k2 −ρ +
Hloss (zi )
w,ξ,ρ 2
υN i

max

(24)

where zi = wφ(xi ). The constraints defined in Eq. 24 are integrated into
Hloss (zi ). The samples satisfying zi = w.φ(xi ) ≥ ρ, are positioned above
the hyperplane and no penalty is added, hence Hloss (zi ) = 0, whereas
samples satisfying zi = wφ(xi ) < ρ are located on the other side of the
hyperplane and some penalty should be inflicted, therefore Hloss (zi ) =
ρ−zi > 0, which says that if the samples move far away from the hyperplane
the penalty increases.
• OCSVM with ramp loss function:
As described above, the hinge loss function is unbounded and sensitive
to the noise, the ramp loss function was introduced to OCSVM to make
the model more robust [45]. The ramp loss function is described as follows:

Rloss(ρ,l) (zi ) =




0,

zi ≥ ρ

ρ − zi , ρl < z < ρ


ρ − lρ, z ≤ ρl
i

(25)

June 8, 2021

Manuscript

S. K. Sonbhadra et al.

where 0 < l < 1. When zi > lρ, the ramp loss is same to the hinge loss;
whereas for zi ≤ lρ, the ramp loss is a constant that is an advantage over
hinge loss which increases as zi decreases. This loss function is capable to
deal with the shortest distance of the target class samples and less sensitive
to the noise. The ramp loss OCSVM can written as:
N
1
1 X
2
max k w k −ρ +
Rloss (zi )
w,ξ,ρ 2
υN i

(26)

where zi = wφ(xi ). Due to non-convexity of ramp loss the OCSVM problem is no longer a convex optimization. This problem is solved by the phenomenon that the Rloss is actually the difference between two hinge loss
functions and the modified formulation of the ramp loss OCSVM consists
of the convex part and the concave part. This new problem is solved by
“Concave-Convex Procedure” (CCP) procedure [11].
• Pin ball SVM: The pinball loss function is given as follows, which can be
regarded as a generalized l1 loss.

Pτ (u) =

(
u,
−τ u,

u≥0
u<0

(27)

where range of τ is [0, 1] [17]. For quantile regression [23], [9], the pinball
loss Pτ has been successfully applied.
Huang et al. [17] derived quantile classification using the idea of support
vector machine (SVM). It has been shown that pinball and hinge loss SVM
have similar consistency property and computational complexity, moreover
the pinball loss SVM is less sensitive to noise.
Huang et al. [17] introduced pinball loss into the SVM. Consider the
data points to be classified denoted by the set T . To solve the classification
task, w ∈ Rn and b ∈ R must be identified such that:
wT φ(xi ) + b ≥ 1
T

w φ(xi ) + b ≤ −1

for yi = 1
for yi = −1

(28)

where φ(.) is a nonlinear mapping from the input space to a new feature
space. The optimal hyperplane wT φ(x) + b = 0, lies exactly between the
supporting parallel hyperplanes given by:
wT φ(x) + b = 1 and wT φ(x) + b = −1

(29)

and separates the binary class samples from each other with a margin of kwk
on each side. Data points residing on the supporting hyperplanes (Eq. 29)
are termed as support vectors. The classifier is obtained by maximizing the
margin. If the data points of two different classes are not linearly separable

in feature space then to separate all the data points correctly, pinball loss
Pτ (x, y, f (x)) is introduced to allow the existence of data points that violate
the constraints yi (wT φ(xi ) + b) ≥ 1. Finally, the nonlinear Pin-SVM is
formulated as follows:
t

max
w,b

X
1
k w k2 +c
Pτ (zi )

(30)

After employing the pinball loss function in Eq. 30, following quadratic
programming problem (QPP) come into existence for Pin-SVM:
t

τ

(32)

max

s.t.

where ξ = (ξ1 , ξ2 , ..., ξN )T is a slack variable and c > 0 is a penalty parameter. The parameter c determines the weight between the two terms k w k2
Pt
and i=1 ξi . Pin-SVM has an advantage of noise insensitivity. Meanwhile,
Pin-SVM has similar time complexity to that of standard SVM. Note that
the second constraint of Eq. 32 becomes ξ ≥ 0 when τ = 0, and thus
Pin-SVM reduces to the hinge loss SVM.

4.3. OCSVM with pinball loss function (PB-OCSVM)
From above discussion it is clear that the hinge loss is sensitive to the noise. To
overcome from this problem and to improve the performance of OCSVM, pinball
loss function [17] is fused to standard OCSVM to obtain pinball OCSVM (PBOCSVM). This enhanced version deals with quantile distance [23] that reduces the
sensitivity to the noise. After introducing pinball loss function, the conventional
OCSVM can be rewritten as follows.
N

(33)

where Pτ is pinball loss as shown in Eq. 27 with zi = wT φ(xi ) which helps to the
slope on the target class. Substituting the pinball loss into Eq. 33, following QPP
is obtained:

Finally, the test instance x can be labelled as follows:

(39)

where sign(.) is sign function.
It is well known that the computational complexity of OCSVM is O(NT3c ) where
NTc is the number of the only target class samples, whereas the computational
complexity of PB-OCSVM is found same as OCSVM i.e. O(NTc 3 ). Therefore, the
complexity of the PB-OCSVM is equal to conventional OCSVM, hence pinball loss
function does not increase the computation time of PB-OCSVM.
5. Experiments and results
COVID-19 positive samples of COVID-19 dataset [10] are used as training samples
for OCSVM and the proposed PB-OCSVM whereas other samples of this dataset
along with samples of datasets RSNA [37] and U.S. national library of medicine
(USNLM) collected Montgomery country - NLM(MC) [19] are used for testing.
All the images of fused dataset is pre-processed as discussed in Subsection 4.1 that
outputs the images of size 331 × 331 × 3, where 3 is the number of channels. For PBOCSVM and OCSVM, the COVID-19 positive samples are considered as training
samples whereas deep learning models are trained with multi-class samples (80%
from each class) obtained via respective class balancing techniques. For OCC approaches, all in-class and other class samples are treated as test samples and for
deep learning models all training, remaining in-class and other class samples are
treated as test samples. Once training is done with suitable parameters, OCSVM
and PB-OCSVM are used for testing in two scenarios: test with training samples
and other samples of all three datasets. For performance evaluation five benchmark
parameters have been used to show effectiveness of the proposed model: accuracy,

precision, sensitivity, specificity and confidential interval (CI) with 95% and 98%
confidence (Eq. 40). Comparison of performance of OCSVM and PB-OCSVM is
done with recently proposed deep learning models as shown in Table 2. It is known
that all deep learning models need huge amounts of data and at the same time all
classes must be well defined. Hence, it is necessary to oversampling of COVID-19
samples to any deep learning model. It is observed that all recent deep learning
architectures [28], [1], [42], [4], [14] used oversampling to deal with the data imbalance problem and after massive computational efforts were able to give significant
performance.

where z is standard deviation (1.96 for 95% confidence and 2.33 for 98% confidence)
and N = 1214 is number of samples.
There are total four classes in fused dataset: COVID-19, normal, Tuberculosis
and other pneumonia. Some existing models have been proposed considering all four
classes whereas some articles considered Tuberculosis and other pneumonia classes
as a single class that gives three classes: COVID-19, normal and other pneumonia.
Few papers considered normal, Tuberculosis and other pneumonia as non COVID
class that gives two classes COVID and non COVID. For existing deep learning
architectures, experiments have been performed in three categories with consideration of 4, 3 and 2 classes. For exhaustive comparative analysis, all scenarios have
also been considered for OCSVM and PB-OCSVM and it is observed that both
the models exhibited the consistent performance due of their working principle.
Whereas it is identified that deep learning models perform better in case of binary
class classification approach. It is also observed that both adaptive total variation
and ACE performed nearly equal.

5.1. Workability of proposed PB-OCSVM in presence of noise
To validate the robustness of the proposed PB-OCSVM against the noise, and
to demonstrate its generalized behaviour experiments are performed considering
following scenarios:

To illustrate the generalized effectiveness of the proposed model, 10 benchmark
UCI datasets are experimented with OCSVM and PB-OCSVM. Table 4 shows the
description of datasets used and AUC score of both the classifiers. Experimental results show that the PB-OCSVM performs marginally better than the conventional
OCSVM. To ensure the workability in minimum number of samples, 80% of the target class samples are randomly chosen for training whereas all target class samples
and other class instances are selected for testing as done in earlier experiments.

6. Conclusion
The present research proposes a novel pinball OCSVM (PB-OCSVM) for earlydetection of COVID-19 in presence of limited number of samples. Recently, several
deep learning based automated approaches have been proposed for diagnosis of
COVID-19 using CXR images. All these solutions need enormous multi-class data
samples for unbiased operation. Due to limited availability of CXR images, it is
evident that all deep learning approaches use collection of multiple datasets and
prefer oversampling strategies to ensure smooth functioning. The COVID-19 is a
newly known deadly pandemic and its precise characteristics are still unknown;
therefore, oversampling must not be considered as a concrete solution to achieve
higher diagnosis accuracy.
In present research, the COVID-19 diagnosis is considered as an anomaly/ novelty detection task and a novel variant of OCSVM is proposed under the supervision
of pinball loss function called PB-OCSVM capable to work with limited number of
COVID-19 infected CRX images. The proposed model does not add extra computation overhead and ensures quicker diagnosis. For experiments collection of multiple
datasets are used where the available COVID-19 infected X-ray images are used for
training whereas all in-class and other class samples are treated as test samples. The
same fused dataset is used to evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models and
conventional OCSVM. Experimental results show that PB-OCSVM outperformed
state-of-the-art deep learning models and conventional OCSVM. Meanwhile, it is

23

also evident that the proposed model ensures negligible false-positive and falsenegative rates compared to OCSVM and attains significantly better accuracy, precision, specificity and sensitivity.
To validate the performance and robustness of PB-OCSVM, experiments are
performed with noisy images. Two noisy scenarios are considered for experiments
and results show that PB-OCSVM performs better in both the scenarios compared
to state-of-the-art approaches. For generalized performance evaluation of proposed
model, experiments are also performed with 10 benchmark UCI datasets. Experimental results proves that PB-OCSVM performs significantly better than conventional OCSVM.
The disease diagnosis in healthcare domain is especially an anomaly or novelty
detection task where one-class classification approaches are proven more promising
compared to conventional binary or multi-class classification approaches. In this
context, it is believed that the application of proposed model is not limited and
can also be extended to other disease diagnosis tasks. Meanwhile, the same work
can also be extended to other application domains for anomaly/novelty detection
objectives.
