Abstract—COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. With half
of the world’s countries in lockdown as of April due to this pandemic, monitoring and understanding the spread of the
virus and infection rates and how these factors relate to behavioural and societal parameters is crucial for effective
policy making. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of masks, social distancing, lockdown and self-isolation
for reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our findings based on agent-based simulation modelling show that
whilst requiring a lockdown is widely believed to be the most efficient method to quickly reduce infection numbers, the
practice of social distancing and the usage of surgical masks can potentially be more effective than requiring a
lockdown. Our multivariate analysis of simulation results using the Morris Elementary Effects Method suggests that if a
sufficient proportion of the population wore surgical masks and followed social distancing regulations, then SARS-CoV-2
infections can be controlled without requiring a lockdown.

OVID -19,

informally known as the coronavirus, is a respiratory illness that is
caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1].
It was declared a pandemic by the World
Health Organisation (WHO) on 11th March
2020. As a vaccine for this virus can only be expected to be developed and distributed in mid2021 [2], controlling COVID-19’s infection and
fatality rates over the next year will be critically
dependent on the successful implementation of
public health measures, such as social distancing, isolation, quarantine and usage of masks
[3].
It has almost become common sense that
isolating symptomatic cases, enforcing a lockdown, social distancing and the usage of masks
are amongst the most effective methods of reducing the spread of viral infections. Whilst
kelvin.li@cuhk.edu.hk
s.a.jarvis@bham.ac.uk

there are many pre-existing univariate analyses
evaluating the effectiveness of a particular preventative measure, such as the effectiveness of
cloth masks against surgical masks in reducing
COVID-19 infections [4] [5] and the effectiveness of social distancing [6] [7], there is a lack of
literature that reviews the effectiveness of these
preventative measures relative to each other.
For example, is social distancing more effective
than the isolation of symptomatic cases? Is a
lockdown the most effective option to reduce
infection numbers? How useful are masks relative to the aforementioned strategies?
Traditionally, statistical and mathematical models, such as the Susceptible-InfectedRecovered (SIR) model, have been used to
simulate and predict the trends of pandemics
and answer some of the uncertainties. Unfortunately, they are mostly only useful at establishing the basic principles because of challenges
such as numerical tractability and different research agendas. These models are usually oversimplified and fail to take into account human
behaviour, human contact patterns, population

efficiently capture emergent phenomena and

for reducing the spread of COVID-19 through
the agent-based simulation framework developed in this work.
2.1

Agent-Based Simulation

In this work, we have developed an agentbased simulation based on the SusceptibleInfected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model by Li et
2 M ETHODS
al. [8].
The following section describes the methods
Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a method
used to investigate the effectiveness of masks, of simulating the behaviour and interactions of

Li et al., 2020

autonomous agents in a particular environment
across time steps. Autonomous agents can be
thought of as individual entities that carry out
some set of operations on behalf of a user
but without the interference of that ownership
entity [9]. In this simulation, agents within the
ABM are heterogeneous, meaning that each
agent possesses a unique set of characteristics,
including age group, gender, infection status,
etc., that determine the agent’s behaviour and
the way it interacts with the other agents in the
environment [10].
Agent-based models serve as an effective
main decision support tool to impact the local
and global impact of an upcoming pandemic
and to test whether certain strategies would
work against the pandemic [11]. They have
been used to test combinations of individuallevel (e.g., usage of masks) and mass-action
strategies (e.g., lockdown) in different countries
[12], as well as in smaller urban or rural areas
[13].
Since the 1990s, as more agent-based simulation packages and platforms such as Swarm,
NetLogo, RePast and AnyLogic were released
[14], agent-based modelling became increasingly used to in Biology, to analyse the spread
of epidemics [15].
In this section, we present a summary of
the operational logic of the simulation. For
a more detailed description, the interested

ables constitute the set of independent variables
such as mask usage, social distancing, lockdown delay, case isolation/quarantine, etc., that
can be changed to study their impact on target
variables such as peak infection rate, number
of hospitalizations and deaths, etc. Simulation
structure parameters control how the simulation is run and includes factors such as the
maximum number of time steps, mask effectiveness, symptomatic death rate, healthcare
system capacity, etc. These variable settings
determine the states of different agents in the
simulation, thus controlling their behaviour.
Initially, all individuals in the simulation
are healthy except for the preset proportion
of asymptomatic infected individuals. As these
individuals move around, virus transmission to
uninfected individuals occurs. Over time, the
severity level of infected individuals can increase in a probabilistic manner which can lead
to death or hospitalization. Individuals with
serious symptoms can die based on a probability and the remaining symptomatic cases can
recover.
Below, we discuss different aspects of the
agent-based simulation.

2.1.1 States of Individuals
Each individual in the simulation model
has an associated set of state parameters: health (healthy, asymptomatic, lightsymptomatic, serious-symptomatic, recovered
and dead), mask usage (yes or no), quarantine status (upon developing symptoms), and
hospitalization status (dependent on healthcare
The model used in this paper consists of load and availability). The behaviour of the

als to move only inside their own city.
2.1.5 Modelling Mask Usage
A clinical experiment conducted by MacIntyre
et al. over 1607 people showed that particle
penetration rate was 97% through a cloth mask
and 44% through medical masks [17]. The experiments in this paper assume the use of surgical masks and hence the mask penetration
rate used in the model is 44%. However, this
can be adjusted by the user, as well as the
number of mask users. These mask users have
their probability of getting infected and the
probability of infecting others is reduced down
to (mask penetration rate)%, as the remaining
virus particles are ’filtered’ by their mask.
If an infected mask user meets an uninfected
mask user, then the virus particles are modelled
as having to travel through two layers of masks;
one from the infected person, and one from
the uninfected person. Hence, in this particular
situation, the probability of infecting others is
reduced down to (mask penetration rate%)2 .
2.2

Simulation parameters

A breakdown of different model parameters is
provided in table 1.

Recall that in this research paper, the four main
independent variables of interest are mask usage, social distancing, lockdown and isolation
of symptomatic cases.
For mask usage and isolation rate, the minimum and maximum values are the cases where
nobody follows the rule, and everybody follows the rule, respectively. Hence, 0 is the minimum, and 100 is the maximum.
For social distancing, the minimum value
is the case where nobody follows social distancing rules, which is 0. The maximum value
was chosen to be 2.5 because realistically most
countries enforce social distancing up to 2 metres. Also, the maximum radius of infection is
estimated to be approximately 2 metres.
For lockdown delay, the minimum bound
was chosen to be 7 days because it would
be unrealistic for a government to enforce a
lockdown immediately from the moment the
first person in the country catches the infection.
The maximum bound was chosen to be 32 days
because from the visual analysis and univariate
analysis, delaying the lockdown beyond 20-24
days has a negligible effect on the peak of the
infection curve.

Target Variables

From each simulation run, the number of infections is monitored. As the simulation involves
stochasticity, the peak percentage of infections
across multiple simulation runs for a given
parameter setting is used as a simple and interpretable variable of interest.
For each configuration of parameters, a

more in-depth analysis can be provided, allowing the % of the population infected at
any given time to be recorded, as well as
other more specific target variables such as
the asymptomatic, light-symptomatic, serioussymptomatic, recovered and dead populations
at any point in time.
2.3

Sensitivity Analysis

We are interested in studying the impact of each
of the independent variables on the dependent
variables, as long as the virus-related simulation parameters are kept fixed. For this purpose,
we use univariate analysis and the method of
elementary effects as discussed below.
2.3.1 Univariate Analysis
In a univariate sensitivity analysis, a particular
parameter is adjusted, whilst the remaining parameters remain unadjusted and kept constant.
The peak % of daily infections are recorded for
each run, i.e., the peak point of the infection
curve. This was conducted for each of the four
independent variables in increments of 20%
from the absolute minimum to the absolute
maximum. To ensure statistical robustness in
our results, the simulation is run 12 times for
each increment of the independent variable.
The results are then analysed and plotted on
a scatter graph.
The sensitivity index of each parameter’s
median peak infections were calculated using
the corresponding formula below and was compared to the other parameters.
sensitivity =

Ymax − Ymin
Ymax

(1)

Here, Ymax and Ymin correspond to the maximum and minimum total infections respectively, for each set of parameter settings.
Sensitivity index was chosen because it is an
easily interpretable metric which summarises
how much an NPI can affect infection numbers across all simulation runs. As each set of
parameter configurations is run 12 times and
5 increments are analysed for each of the four
NPIs, this meant that there are 60 simulation
runs for each non pharmaceutical intervention,
and 240 simulation runs in total.

An experiment is run for each of the four
independent parameters according to the range
specified in table 3.
2.3.2

Elementary Effects Method

Whilst the previous univariate sensitivity analysis provided insight regarding the strength
and effect of each individual variable, it fails
to capture multivariate correlation. The following section provides a multivariate analysis of
the four main preventative measures variables
- mask usage, social distancing, symptomatic
isolation and lockdown delay, and how they
interact with each other via Morris’s Elementary Effects Method [23], which is an adaptation
of the One-At-a-Time (OAT) design approach
that identifies the most important variables in
determining the output using a small number
of simulations.
Given a process Y = g(x1 , ..., xk ) dependent
upon k factors with x ∈ [0, 1], r trajectories are
generated by EEM, which is divided into a k dimensional grid consisting of ρ levels of equal
size. A trajectory begins with randomly selected
base values x* = [x1 *, ..., xk *] in the ρ-level grid.
This base vector is used to generate k different
parameter vectors for a particular trajectory. For
this study the EEM trajectories were generated
by the SALib library [24] using a random seed
number of 1.
The first parameter vector x(1) is generated
by adding or subtracting ∆ to one of the parameters. Similarly, x(2) is obtained by adding
or subtracting ∆ to another parameter. The
parameters defined here are used in equations
2-6 below.
After obtaining the values for each parameter vector in the trajectory, the elementary effect
of a parameter can then be obtained using the
formula below:
EEi =

Y (x1 , ..., xi + ∆, ..., xk ) − Y (x1 , ..., xi , ..., xk )
(2)
∆

After the elementary effects were obtained,
the corresponding mean, absolute-mean and
variance of the elementary effect of a variable

3.1.1

Social Distancing

Social distancing has a sensitivity index of
0.784, based on the results presented in table 6,
which is the highest out of the four parameters.
From Figure 2a, it can be seen that there is a significant decrease in the severity of infections as
soon as social distancing was enforced. As the
distance of social distancing further increased,
the severity of infections decreased, following a
negative logarithmic trend. Figure 2b shows the

Mask Usage Rate

Mask usage has a sensitivity index of 0.692,
based on the results presented in table 6, which
is almost identical to lockdown delay but less
than social distancing. From Figure 2c, it was
noticed that as the mask usage rate increased
from 0 to 100, the severity of the virus decreases
with a negative-logarithmic trend, although it is
more linear compared to social distancing. Figure 2d shows that as mask usage increases, the
peak of the curve flattens whilst taking longer
to reach 0 cases again for all configurations.

Lockdown Delay

Lockdown delay has a sensitivity index of
0.683, based on the results from table 6, which
indicates that it appears to have almost as
much effect as mask usage but less than social
distancing. From Figure 3a, the severity of the

TABLE 6: Summary statistics for social distancing, mask usage, lockdown delay and symptomatic

virus increased almost linearly and very steeply
as the lockdown delay was increased until a
certain point, which highlights the importance
of enforcing a lockdown early before the cases
become out of control. In addition, it can be
seen from Figure 3b that enforcing a lockdown
after the peak infection has been reached has
very little effect on the severity of infections.
3.1.4 Symptomatic Case Isolation Rate
Symptomatic case isolation has a sensitivity
index of 0.238, based on the results from table
6, which is the lowest of the four parameters, meaning it has the least effect out of the
four safety measures. From Figure 3c, it was
observed that using this parameter alone will
result in a high variance for all settings compared to the other three preventative measures,
suggesting isolating symptomatic cases alone
will not consistently contain the virus. Figure
3d shows that isolating cases alone linearly
reduces the peak of the infection curve, but it is
relatively less effective in flattening the curve,
as it takes a similar time to reach 0 cases again.
3.2

Elementary Effects Analysis Results

The results of the elementary effects analysis
are shown in table 7. From the results in this
table, social distancing is the most effective
measure in reducing the peak of the infection
curve, followed by mask usage, lockdown delay and finally isolation of symptomatic cases.
Social distancing has the highest value of µi *,
meaning the peak of the infection curve is very
sensitive to the measure. It also has the highest
value of σ , meaning that there is a large interaction between this parameter and the other three
parameters.

TABLE 7: Results of elementary effects for 30
trajectories, p = 6 and ∆ = 0.2

As seen from the results table, enforcing
a lockdown has a relatively lower σ and µi *
compared to masks and social distancing, indicating that it has less effect on the peak
of the infection curve than masks and social
distancing regardless of parameter interactions.
Whilst the univariate analysis earlier showed
that a lockdown is the most effective measure
at reducing the peak of the infection curve as
quickly as possible, this experiment showed
that a lockdown may not be necessary in the
first place, as there would potentially be no
significant infection peak initially if social distancing was followed and masks were used by
everyone.

3.3 Relationship of EEM Results with
Trends in Different Countries
In order to understand the correspondence of
simulation results with real-world data, we
have studied the trends of viral transmission
across different countries. Specifically, we obtained the COVID-19 timelines, the main preventative measures and infection numbers over
time for the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and
Italy. We then compared these trends and num-

ily focused on the isolation of symptomatic
cases and were much slower than Hong Kong
to enforce any other safety measures [51]. For
example, it took the United Kingdom longer
than a month before restaurants, pubs, schools
and entertainment venues were shut, and several more months before people started wearing masks. This lead to the infection curve
rising to drastically higher values compared to
Hong Kong as seen in Figure 4, which compares

the percentage of the overall population infected daily between the three countries. It can
be seen that the cases in the UK and Italy were
exponentially higher than Hong Kong, and they
were left with no choice but to implement a
lockdown, which is forecasted by the EEM and
univariate analysis results.

ing banning flights from India [60], which is
replicated by reducing the randomly selected
weekly infections from 10 to 2 again. Also, a
semi-lockdown was enforced again, which is
replicated in the model by re-enabling social
distancing and total lockdown.
Hong Kong Validation Results
Initially, the model infection numbers began
rising at a relatively fast pace, but the tightening
of borders and semi-lockdown were effective
and infection numbers came to a halt at around
day 20 and cases started to reduce again and
was back to almost zero by approximately day
50, resembling the first wave and second wave
of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, compared to the
real-world data figure as seen in Figure 6.
From day 120, the increase of imported
case, reduction of social distancing and disablement of semi-lockdown caused the numbers to
rapidly spike to approximately twice as high as
the initial spike, which also resembles the realworld data.
From day 141, the tightening of borders,
increase of social distancing and a second semilockdown quickly dampened again. Overall,
the model produced an infection curve strongly
resembling historical data in Hong Kong, as
seen by the simulation plot in Figure 5 and the
real-world data plot in Figure 6. The raw number of infections was also significantly smaller
than the infections in the UK and Italy, strongly
resembling the real-world trend.
3.4.2 Italy
The age distribution used for the simulation of
Italy is provided in table 9, calculated from data

provided by the United Nations [53].
Italy Validation Setup
The simulation starts from the moment Italy
received their initial case. Italy almost immediately stopped all the direct flights from China,
whilst keeping all other flights open. Hence, the
initial random number of infections per week is
set to 25. Not many people are initially aware of
the virus and many thought it was a common
cold until awareness was raised via media [62].
Hence, the initial symptomatic isolation rate is
set at 30%, and later raised to 60% in the 3rd
day, and 90% on the seventh day after people
became increasingly aware of the virus.
As the virus quickly became out of control,
Italy began closing some cities [63], which is
modelled by enabling city confinement on the
7th day. Schools also closed soon afterwards
[63], which increases social distancing. Hence,
this is modelled by increasing the social distancing metres to 0.5, also on the 7th day.
Note that although cities are confined, essential
workers can still travel between cities.
The government then began strictly enforcing 1 metre of social distancing [64], which is
modelled by increasing the social distancing
metres to 1 on the 10th day.
Although the rate of infections has reduced,
the curve was still rising, and Italy further
increased their safety measures by enforcing
mobility restrictions, followed by a total lockdown [63]. This is implemented in the model by
increasing the social distancing metres to 1.5 on
day 12 and enabling total lockdown as well as
decreasing the random infections to 6 per week
on day 15 respectively.
This gradually stopped the increase of cases,
and the curve quickly dropped, similar to the
real data. After an extended period of lockdown, the government began reopening public
facilities and relaxing the lockdown rules [65],
which is modelled by disabling the total lockdown and reducing the social distancing metres
to 1. This caused the rate of reduction to slow
down. Eventually, Italy partially reopened its
borders to some neighbouring European countries [66], which is modelled in the simulation

TABLE 10: Age structure of UK’s population
[53]

As the UK stopped releasing daily recovered cases data after April 13th 2020 [52], the
active cases could not be calculated and as a
result, the active cases could not be plotted.
Hence, the validation numbers are compared
to the number of real daily cases, which also
possesses a similar distribution.
UK Validation Results
As a result of the herd immunity strategy, the
number of cases rapidly increased for the first
9 days. After the UK changed the strategy and
increased social distancing and put closed facilities. This had an effect on slowing down the
rate of increase of infections, as visualised by
the green curve in Figure 9, followed by the
blue and orange curve due to the symptomatic
delay. However, it can be seen that the curve
was still increasing, indicating that these NPI’s
were not strong enough to contain the virus.
It was not until the enforcement of a full
lockdown and tightening of border control
where the active cases stopped increasing. The
number of active cases then began to slowly
decrease after day 22.
The relaxing of lockdown rules on day 28
cause the rate of decrease of cases to slow
down, and the relaxing of border control further reduced the rate decrease. Eventually, the
partial reopening of facilities caused the number of infections to gradually rise again, resembling the historical trend in Figure 4, suggesting
a new wave is approaching, which is correct
according to historical data [52]. The overall
distribution of the model infection curve resembles the historical data fairly strongly.

3.5

Discussion

Although the results from the univariate analysis suggested that a lockdown was the quickest
way to instantly reduce the infection numbers
in the shortest time out of the four safety measures, the results from the multivariate analysis
showed that social distancing and usage of
surgical masks have a more significant effect
on reducing infection numbers, as they have
relatively higher values of µ* and σ .

C ONCLUSION

AND

F UTURE W ORK

Whilst the resulting model can produce a reasonably fair estimation of the trend of COVID19 as well as determine the effectiveness of certain preventative measures, for it to be used by
policy makers to make key decisions, the model
needs to be further refurbished and more complex, i.e. take into account more real-life factors.
Instead, due to its ease of use and flexibility,
it can be used as a tool and source for policy
makers to back up their various hypotheses in
combination with other research and models,
and to visualise how certain interventions will
affect the infection trend.
One could extend this model in the future by adding features such as small venues,
schools and transport, which will allow the
model to make even more realistic predictions.
One can also continue to monitor trends from
different countries and observe how the findings of the Morris Elementary Effects method
relate to the trend.
In conclusion, the results from the univariate and multivariate analysis have strongly suggested that there would be no need to enforce a
lockdown at all if a sufficient proportion of the
population followed the social distancing and
mask usage guidelines, as the peak infection
number would be sufficiently controlled and
relatively low.
