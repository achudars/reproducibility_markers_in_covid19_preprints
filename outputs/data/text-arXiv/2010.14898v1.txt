Abstract
We propose a simple model of spreading of some infection in an originally healthy
population which is different from other models existing in the literature. In particular, we use an operator technique which allows us to describe in a natural way the
possible interactions between healthy and un-healthy populations, and their transformation into recovered and to dead people. After a rather general discussion, we
apply our method to the analysis of Chinese data for the SARS-2003 (Severe acute
respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV-1) and the Coronavirus COVID-19 (Corona Virus
Disease; SARS-CoV-2 ) and we show that the model works very well in reproducing
the long-time behaviour of the disease, and in particular in finding the number of
affected and dead people in the limit of large time. Moreover, we show how the
model can be easily modified to consider some lockdown measure, and we deduce
that this procedure drastically reduces the asymptotic value of infected individuals,
as expected, and observed in real life.

Introduction

In recent months the entire world has faced an emergency due to the outbreak of the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As for other infectious
diseases outbreak, it is crucial to estimate the transmission dynamics of the infection in the
various stages of the disease. This can provide insights into the epidemiological situation
and identify whether outbreak control measures have significant effects, [1]. Moreover, the
potentiality of predicting a dynamical equilibrium in which the total amount of infected
individuals has reached the plateau is of valuable importance, as it helps to estimate the
risk for other countries or forecasts the possible conclusion of the emergency.
In this respect a mathematical (and statistical) analysis and its connection with biological aspects play a crucial role. This analysis can include the statistical evaluation
of the up to date relevant quantities such as the various growth rates of the numbers of
the infected, dead and recovered individuals through statistical arguments and best fit
procedures with well known phenomenological models like the exponential and logistic
one. More sophisticated stochastic models can of course be adopted, providing more precise results: they can take into account for time-varying extrinsic factors typical of the
epidemic course (social cycles and climatic variations, see discussions in [2, 3]) and viral
phylodynamics with genetic variations, see [4, 5]. Other models can increase the reliability of the forecasting including agent-based simulations capable to take into account
for a variety of complex connections and the population mobility, [6]. Needless to say,
a huge research activity has been devoted in the last months to the mathematical modeling related to the spreading of COVID-19, using different kind of approaches: Monte
Carlo simulations, [7], deep learning and fuzzy rule [8], compartments/SIR-like epidemic
models, [9, 10], transmission network models, [11], to cite a few. Despite the fact that
the various models can include a large variety of variables that can improve the reliability
of the forecasting outcomes, the unpredictable intrinsic variability of any infection leads
very often to the failure of the adopted model in predicting the evolution of the infection
process. Most models, especially the very basic ones, could work only to reproduce the
evolution of the infection up to the moment the model is applied, and the best parameters
used to fit real data can dramatically change when the data are upgraded. This is evident
in these days, when many groups of scientists were (and are) forced to change everyday
2

their own estimates on the final numbers of infected or dead people, or on the plausible
end of the emergency. The world of the statistical and mathematical methods applied to
the detection of disease outbreaks is huge and constantly growing, and we refer to [12, 13]
for recent reviews containing further literature and valuable comments on this field.
The common idea behind the various models is that the host population is divided into
distinct classes, according to its epidemiological status: the classical SIR formalism is
often used, according to the classes Susceptible to the disease (S), currently Infectious (I),
and Recovered (R), and adding other classes (for instance Exposed (E) or Dead (D)) is
commonly done to give depth to the model. In this paper we adopt an operatorial method
based on certain ladder operators appearing often in quantum mechanical systems (but
not only) to describe the long time dynamics of an infected population, assuming that
the main classes of the model are the infected, recovered and dead individuals. As we
shall see, the susceptible/healthy individuals play the role of “reservoir” for the infected
people. The underlying idea of our model is to construct an Hamiltonian operator H for a
certain system S using ladder operators, and using the Heisenberg equations of motion to
deduce the time evolution of some relevant observables of S, the aforementioned classes
of individuals, on a macro-scale (we actually compute the time evolution of the densities
of these classes). The Hamiltonian H contains all the interactions occurring between the
different agents of S. In particular, ladder operators can be easily used to describe the
mechanisms leading to the infection process and to the subsequent recovery or death, and
to define a suitable H giving rise to these processes.
This is actually the first attempt to use operatorial methods in application to infection
processes: they have been successfully used in various biological contexts, to fit real data
by modeling population-resources dynamics, [14], to model basic cancer cell dynamics,
[15, 16], to reproduce biological aspects of the bacterial dynamics, [17], and to model a
basic epigenetic evolution, [18] (see [19, 20] for other fields of application). Our main
goal is to provide a reliable long time dynamics capable to capture the final stage of the
infection when the various densities of the classes have reached some sort of equilibrium
values. For concreteness, we shall apply our model to the the recent COVID 19 outbreaks
and to the previous SARS in 2003.
The paper is organized as follows: in Section II we present the model and the mathe3

matical settings, and we define the main operators used to construct the Hamiltonian of
the system. We derive the dynamics in Section II.2. In Section III we apply our model to
capture the long time behavior of the recent Coronavirus pandemics in China and in the
Italian region of Umbria, and that of the SARS epidemics in 2003 in China. Furthermore,
by slightly enriching our model, we show how imposing lockdown measures after 10 days
from the beginning of the spreading of the epidemics is beneficial for the long time value
of infected, recovered and dead individuals. Our conclusions are given in Section IV, while
the Appendices contain few facts on the number representation of quantum mechanics
(Appendix 1) and some useful formula on the dynamics of the populations (Appendix 2).

II

The model and its dynamics

In this section we will introduce our model, starting with a general description of its
components, introducing then to the possible interactions between them leading to the
Hamiltonian of the system, and deducing, out of it, the differential equations of motion
and their solutions, with particular interest to their long time behavior. We refer to [19]
and to [20] for many details on this approach, for many different applications of this
strategy, and for many references.
Our system S consists of four different compartments: healthy, infected, recovered and
dead individuals. These populations, when considered as sets, are not of the same kind:
in particular, the set of healthy people is very large, when compared to the other three.
This is because a small percentage of the whole population is infected, in most epidemics
experienced so far in mankind’s history. For this reason, using a well settled approach, we
consider the healthy people as a sort of big reservoir, R, for a smaller (in size) system, SP ,
made of the other three compartments. Then S = R ∪ SP . These compartments interact
as diagrammatically shown in Figure 1: first of all, healthy people can be infected. Those
who have been infected, either die or recover. The latter fill up again the set of healthy
people. These are the essential reasonable mechanisms which we imagine occur during an
epidemic, according to the literature on this topic. We are not going into the biological
reasons why the contagion can spread all along the population. We only want to describe
the possible consequences of our simple view to the system, and show how the long time
4

behaviour of the number of the three relevant populations here can be recovered, and are
in good agreement in some concrete applications of our general model.

Figure 1: The system and its multi-component reservoir.
As in similar approaches on several dynamical systems considered using operator techniques, see [19, 20], we attach some ladder operators to each compartment of the system,
and we assume these operators obey suitable commutation relations. The particular choice
of these relations is very much related to the characteristics of the system we are interested in. Here we will assume that the relevant rules are the anti-commutation relations,
(CAR), as we propose next. The reason for this choice will be clarified later.
The ladder operators for the infected are p1 and p†1 , those for the recovered are p2 and
p†2 , while p3 and p†3 are those for the dead. To the healthy people is attached a family of
ladder operators, labeled by a continuous index k ∈ R, B(k) and B † (k). The following
rules are assumed:
{pn , p†m } = δn,m 11,

{B(k), B † (q)} = δ(k − q) 11,

(2.1)

for all n, m = 1, 2, 3 and k, q ∈ R. Here {x, y} := xy + yx. All the other anti-commutators
are taken to be zero. For instance,
{pn , pm } = {B(k), B(q)} = {pn , B(k)} = {pn , B † (k)} = . . . = 0.
5

(2.2)

The rationale for this choice, widely discussed in recent years, see [19, 20] and references
therein, is mainly based on the simple remark that the use of ladder operators is an easy
and natural way to describe exchange mechanisms between different compartments of a
composite system. This aspect will be clarified soon.
The operators above are used to construct an operator, the Hamiltonian H of S, which
is the generator of the dynamics of the system. In details, we will assume the following
expression for H:

 H2 = σ1,2 p†1 p2 + p†2 p1 + σ1,3 p†1 p3 + p†3 p1 .
Here ωj and the σ’s are all real quantities, and Ω(k) is a real-valued function, so that H
appears as a (formally) Hermitian operator. The meaning of the various contributions in
H, and their relations with the scheme in Figure 1, is quite standard in the operatorial
interpretation of an Hamiltonian. The first term in H1 models the vertical line in Figure
1. In particular, B(k)p†1 describes the fact the number of healthy people decrease (because
of B(k), which is a lowering operator), while the density of the infected increases because
of p†1 , which is a raising operator1 . Notice that H1 also contains the adjoint term p1 B † (k),
which can be seen as a recovery term: the density of infected decreases (as the effect of p1 ),
while that of healthy people increases, because of B † (k). Our model also admits a twosteps recovery path: first the infected slightly recover, and then they recover completely.
It is like going from the intensive care to other departments
in the hospital, and then

†
being released. This double steps are described by σ1,2 p1 p2 + p†2 p1 in H2 , and by the
second term in H1 . As before, we have a contribution p2 B † (k) describing full recovery,
but we also have a term B(k)p†2 which describes the possibility that someone, negative to
1

Of course, a full comprehension of this mechanism is possibly having a knowledge of the functional
Hilbert space structure connected to CAR. In particular, the action of creation and annihilation operators
on certain vectors is the crucial ingredient in this construction. All these details, which are well known
to all who are familiar with second quantization, can be found in [21], or in [19, 20] more in connection
with what is relevant for this paper. We also list some useful results in Appendix 1

a first swab, becomes positive later. This term could also be relevant in describing people
who fall again infected, after a first recovery. A similar interpretation we can imagine
for the term σ1,2 p†1 p2 : part of those which apparently are recovering, fall again infected.
As for H0 , this is a standard free term, not affecting all the populations in absence of
interactions. In other words, if H = H0 , the densities of the members of each population
does not change with time. However, in all the systems considered along the years, H0
becomes relevant mainly in presence of interactions, and describes some inertia of the
various compartments, see [19, 20].
It is clear that the analytic form of H could be enriched, for instance by adding extra
terms, by requiring some explicit time dependence in the Hamiltonian itself, or also by
relaxing the assumption that H should be Hermitian, [22, 23]. We could also refine our
analysis by assuming that some external rule acts on the system, as proposed in [24].
This possibility will be considered later on, and we will show that it produces interesting
results.
We can now go back to the analysis of the dynamics of the system, by assuming
that this is driven by the same standard mechanisms which work well in presence of
operator-valued unknown. In particular, we use the Heisenberg equations of motion
Ẋ(t) = i[H, X(t)], [19, 20], which produces, by using the CAR (2.1) and (2.2) above,
the following:

(2.4)

This is a system of four ordinary, operator valued, linear differential equations in four
unknowns which describes the time evolution of the essential dynamical variables of the
system, the lowering operators pj (t), j = 1, 2, 3 and B(q, t). So it is not surprising that
we can deduce an explicit analytic (but rather implicit) solution. As a matter of fact, this
system is a simplified version of the one deduced in [25], to which we refer for the details
of the solution of this system. Here we briefly review some essential steps, focusing on
what is interesting for us.
7

From the time evolution of the above operators, we can deduce the time evolution
of the relevant operators used to measure the densities of the various populations. In
fact we consider the evolution of the number operators related to the pj (t) above, P̂j (t) =
p†j (t)pj (t), j = 1, 2, 3, and then to their mean values on suitable states describing the initial
conditions of S, see below, i.e., for us, the initial numbers (or, more properly, densities)
of the infected, recovered and dead. It is very well known that the mean values of the
number operators attached to ladder operators satisfying the CAR are always quantities
ranging in [0, 1], in agreement with our interpretation of these quantities as densities of
the populations of SP from a macroscopic point of view.

II.1

The state on S

Because of the relevance of the CAR for our model, it is natural to introduce the vacuum
of the pj , i.e. the non zero vector ϕ0,0,0 in HP = C8 , the Hilbert space of SP , satisfying
the condition pj ϕ0,0,0 = 0, j = 1, 2, 3. The other vectors of the orthonormal basis Fϕ =
{ϕn1 ,n2 ,n3 , n1 , n2 , n3 = 0, 1} for HP can be constructed as follows:
ϕ1,0,0 = p†1 ϕ0,0,0 ,

ϕ0,1,0 = p†2 ϕ0,0,0 ,

ϕ1,1,0 = p†1 p†2 ϕ0,0,0 ,

ϕ1,1,1 = p†1 p†2 p†3 ϕ0,0,0 ,

and so on. Now, the reason why P̂j (t) is called ”number operator” is because, if we
compute is action on ϕn1 ,n2 ,n3 , we get P̂j ϕn1 ,n2 ,n3 = nj ϕn1 ,n2 ,n3 , j = 1, 2, 3 and P̂j = P̂j (0).
This means that the elements of Fϕ are eigenstates of P̂j , properties which is lost for
t > 0: in general, P̂j (t)ϕn1 ,n2 ,n3 is not even proportional to ϕn1 ,n2 ,n3 .
In view of what we have discussed before, the subsystem SP is described, at t = 0, by
the vector ϕ0,0,0 . This is because the eigenvalues of the P̂j (t)’s, or better (see below), their
mean values, are proportional to the densities of the various compartments. Therefore,
since at t = 0 there are no elements of P1 , P2 and P3 , SP must be described by ϕ0,0,0 ,
which is the only vector in Fϕ with eigenvalues n1 = n2 = n3 = 0.
At this stage, we observe that SP is just a part of S: we still have to clarify how a
state over R should be defined, and which are its properties. Once again, we refer to
[19, 20] for the details: here we only stress that the state over R is not expected to be
of the same kind of that for SP , because these two parts of S are really different in size:
R is enormous, while each Pj is relatively small. This is reflected by the fact that, while
8

SP is described in terms of just 3 operators acting on an 8-dimensional Hilbert space, the
full description of R requires a continuous number of operators2 . The state on R is a
positive linear functional, [26, 27], on the algebra of the reservoir operators satisfying the
following (standard) rules:
ωR (11R ) = 1,

ωR (B(k)) = ωR (B † (k)) = 0,

ωR (B † (k)B(q)) = N (k) δ(k − q),

(2.5)

for some suitable function N (k), as well as ωR (B(k)B(q)) = 0. In analogy with what
happens for SP , N (k) is also set to be constant in k. From now on, we set N (k) = N ,
and this value is a kind of measure of the density of people exposed to the infection, i.e.
a way to measure the strength of the infection process: N = 0 actually means that there
are no people exposed (or in other way absence of infection), whereas increasing value of
N gives strength to the infection (i.e. more people are exposed). This will be clear later
on when we show a specific asymptotic solution corresponding to a particular choice of
the parameters, and changing the value of N can drastically modify the whole dynamics,
an aspect we shall use in our applications.
The state over the full system S, h.i, is defined, for all operators of the form XS ⊗ YR ,
XS being an operator of SP and YR an operator of the reservoir, as follows:
hXS ⊗ YR i := hϕn1 ,n2 ,n3 , XS ϕn1 ,n2 ,n3 i ωR (YR ).

(2.6)

For the purposes of our model, we define the mean values of the number operators, which
are what we can call the density functions for the system
D
E D
E
Pj (t) := P̂j (t) = p†j (t)pj (t) ,
(2.7)
j = 1, 2, 3. Before going back to the analysis of the dynamics, it might be useful to
observe that definition (2.7) implies that, taking ϕn1 ,n2 ,n3 = ϕ0,0,0 in (2.6), Pj (0) = 0 for
j = 1, 2, 3. This is because P̂j (0) is identified with P̂j (0) ⊗ 11R , recalling that ωR (11R ) = 1.
This result obviously reflects the initial conditions assumed for SP .
2

We could use also a discrete, but still infinite, number of ladder operators, but this would make many
computations more complicated, [19, 20].

II.2

Back to the system

The details of the computations of Pj (t) can be found, for a different (and slightly larger)
system, in [20, 25]. Here we only write the final analytical expression for Pj (t) in (2.7). For
that, we need to introduce first some useful quantities. We start defining the symmetric
block matrix U as follows

Here Ω is a positive constant related to Ω(k), which we assume is linear in k: Ω(k) = Ωk.
Further we call Vt := e−U t , (Vt )j,k its (j, k)-th matrix element, and
i
h

2
pk (t) = |(Vt )j,k | ,
pk,l (t) = 2< (Vt )j,k (Vt )j,l ,
where <(z) stands for the real part of the complex quantity z. We write the explicit
formula for the density functions assuming first that the initial state on SP coincides with
one of the element of Fϕ and then extending the result to the general case in which this
state is a linear combination (normalized to one) of the elements of Fϕ . If the initial state
is ϕn1 ,n2 ,n3 we have
(a)
(b)
Pj (t) = Pj (t) + Pj (t),

where

Πj (s) = |σB,1 (Vs )j,1 + σB,2 (Vs )j,2 |2 .

(2.11)

In particular, let us see what happens if we assume that, at t = 0, the three Pj
populations are empty, while all the people is healthy (which is what we have already
assumed several times so far). In other words: the infection starts to propagate at t = 0
from a situation in which everyone is healthy. This fixes uniquely the state on which the
mean values of the P̂j (t) must be computed. If this is the case, then the values of the nk
in (2.9) are all zero. Moreover, the block form of the matrix U is translated to a similar
form for Vt . This implies that (Vt )j,k+3 = 0 for all j, k = 1, 2, 3. Hence the conclusion is
that, assuming that at t = 0 the number of infected, recovered and dead is zero, the term
(a)
Pj (t) does not contribute to Pj (t) in (2.8). It is possible in this case to determine the
asymptotic limit of the density functions :

Pj (∞) = lim

which are directly related to the long time behaviour of the various compartments in a real
epidemic. As anticipated, the value of N modifies the asymptotic value of the density
functions, and increasing N increases the infected and as a consequence the recovered and
the dead, whereas if N = 0 no one is infected. For a specific choice of parameters, the
limits in eq. (2.12) can be analytically computed. Indeed, setting σB,2 = 0 and ωj = 0
(j = 1, 2, 3) we get, as deduced from the results in the Appendix 2,

This extension is relevant for what discussed in Section III.1, since it will not be possible,

case the densities are given for all j by

and Pj (t) is the same as in (2.10). We observe that Pj reduces to (2.9) if the initial

state coincides with (only) one of the ϕn1 ,n2 ,n3 and δPj (t) = 0. Otherwise δPj (t) 6= 0,
and it can be considered as an interference term which appears only if the state is a
non trivial superposition of the elements of Fϕ . We will show that this may produce
some not negligible oscillations of the Pj (t), which might appear strange. However, this
is nor really a big surprise: similar oscillations have been observed, in a different context
but with a similar approach, when dealing with decision making, [28]. This happens
again in presence of non trivial superpositions of states, as in formula (2.14). These
oscillations are particularly evident during the first part of the time evolution, while they
tend to disappear for t sufficiently large. The mathematical source of the oscillations is
the Hermiticity of H, and could be possibly avoided by removing this constraint, as it
was done in [15] in a different biological application of ladder operators. Here we are
not particularly worried by these oscillations, since our main interest is in the long-time
dynamics of the system, where in any case the oscillations disappear (or are negligible).

Applications

In this section we show how this model can efficiently reproduce the long time dynamics
in some recent epidemics. In particular, we will concentrate on SARS and Coronavirus in
China, and on Coronavirus in the Italian region of Umbria.
Coronavirus pandemic, as far as we know today, started in Wuhan, China, most likely
at the end of December 2019. Until January 2020 the epidemic was apparently confined
to China with few thousands of confirmed cases, while between February and March it
spread in Europe, in the US, and in other countries, being therefore declared a pandemic
and reaching a total number of confirmed cases of more than eight million, still growing.
The 2002-2004 severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS outbreak was first identified in
Foshan, Guangdong, China, in late 2002. Up to May 2004 it caused over 8,000 individual
infections from 29 different countries, and more than 900 deaths worldwide. The major
part of the outbreak was concentrated in the first part of the 2003 despite several SARS
cases were reported until May 2004.
We show here the results concerning the long time behavior by capturing trough
best-fit procedures the parameters which minimize the relative error with the precise
values of cumulative infected, recovered and dead individuals in China for both SARS
and Coronavirus and in Umbria, Italy. As we cannot work with a formal expression of
the solution, in general, our fitting procedure was based on restricting first the range
of the various parameters by requiring good qualitative behaviors of the solutions (when
compared with the real data), and then by performing refined variations of the parameters
trying each time to minimize the errors.
All the real quantities are scaled with the final value of total confirmed cases, which
in our cases are 5327 for the SARS, 80928 for the Coronavirus in China, and 1400 for the
Coronavirus in Umbria, Italy3 . Data are shown in Figure 2 relative to the period MarchJuly 2003 for SARS epidemic, that is from the first reported infection up to plateau.
Similar plots are shown in Figure 3 and 4 for Coronavirus in China and Umbria, respectively. All the initial densities are equal to zero. After the initial transient in which
infection rapidly growths, and in which the model reproduces the real data only at a

the analyzed periods. As one can see, the errors are in general very small, especially for
the fitted recovered and dead, showing the good asymptotic predictability of our model.

III.1

Lockdown measures

We consider now a simple variation of the model in which we adaptively change the parameters of the Hamiltonian to correct the Heisenberg dynamics to model the introduction
of some countermeasures meant to fight the spreading of the disease. In particular, following the basic ideas of the (H, ρ)-induced dynamics introduced in [24] and used in several
other applications, [20], we change the value of the parameters (in our case just one)
of the Hamiltonian at some specific time, mimicking in this way the occurence of some
check in the real-life situation. This induces a sort of discrete time dependence for the
Hamiltonian.
To be more specific, we suppose that at the time ∆T the parameter N in (2.5) is
adjusted to mimic the effects of some social rules, imposed by the the government, which
limit the diffusion of the disease. We recall that, as suggested by (2.12), N is a measure of
the density of the exposed people, i.e. the reservoir, so that decreasing (resp. increasing)
N limits (resp. eases) the infection process: in particular, decreasing N , we are modelling
what has been called social distance.
Starting with an initial state Ψ0 = ϕ0,0,0 , we let the system evolve up to ∆T , and we
compute the densities using (2.8). Then we change the value of N , taking a lower value
to mimic the beginning of a lockdown, and we start the new dynamics with a new initial
state
X
Ψnew =
αn1 ,n2 ,n3 ϕn1 ,n2 ,n3 ,
n1 ,n2 ,n3

which is constructed by requiring the continuity of the densities (not their differentiability
in general). The form of this state is obtained by choosing the coefficients of Ψnew as follow:
p
P1 (∆T ) − P2 (∆T ) − P3 (∆T ),
(3.1)
α1,0,0 =
p
α1,1,0 =
P2 (∆T ),
(3.2)
p
α1,0,1 =
P3 (∆T ),
(3.3)
p
α0,0,0 =
1 − P1 (∆T ),
(3.4)
while the other coefficients are set to 0. Notice that (3.1)-(3.4) ensures the continuity
of the densities at ∆T , and (3.4), in particular, ensures the normalization of Ψnew to 1.
The requirement that the other coefficients are 0 simply follows from our interpretation
16

of the vectors of the basis Fϕ : it is not possible to have dead, or recovered, in absence
of infected. This is the reason why we impose that α0,n2 ,n3 = 0, if n2 or n3 , or both,
are different from zero. Moreover, we also put α1,1,1 = 0 since there is no possibility to
have the same number of infected, recovered and dead. Of course there are other forms of
the coefficients which ensure the continuity of the densities, but our choice works already
rather well, and it is easy to implement. It might be useful to notice that the problem
of fixing the coefficients in Ψnew would be authomatically solved if we were able to work
in the Schrödinger, rather than in the Heisenberg, representation. But this is not easy at
all, for our Hamiltonian.
In Figure 6, we present the results concerning SARS and COVID-19, using the same
parameters as reported in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively, and with ∆T = 10 and
N = 0.8: this is like saying that, after 10 days, the lockdown measures lowered the normal
density of the people from 1 to 0.8. A direct comparison of the density functions with
and without the applied measures is shown in Figure 7. Of course different values of ∆T
and lower values of N could be chosen, producing quantitative difference in the results,
but with similar qualitative outcomes (i.e. reduction of the infection). We can observe
here that oscillations in the transient are evident, and disappear with the exception of
the dead density in the SARS case: in this case the asymptotic behavior of the density is
an oscillating function (not fully shown in the figure) with period T ≈ 90 and mean value
P̄3 = 0.036. It is interesting to stress that this value is much lower than the asymptotic
value P3 (∞) = 0.065 obtained without any lockdown measure. Therefore, the procedure
of imposing a lockdown at a certain time via a certain social distance, is able, in the
model, to reduce significantly the asymptotic number of infected, recovered and dead
individuals, in agreement with what observed in real life.

Conclusions

In this paper we propose a model for the spreading of infection diseases which is different
from those based on differential equations or stochastic approaches. We adopt an operatorial approach inspired by quantum mechanics and based on creation and annihilation
operators. This is because ladder operators allow to encode, in a simple and elegant way,

real interactions among different individuals through Hamiltonian interaction terms and
to consider one population as a sort of reservoir for the others. The application to the
spreading of SARS in 2003 in China and of COVID-19 in China and in the Italian region
of Umbria shows how such a model is able to capture well the asymptotic behavior of the
spreading. In addition, imposing lockdown measures by reducing a model parameter at a
precise instant of time, we have shown that it is possible to reduce significantly the number of infected individuals, and of the recovered and dead as a consequence. Of course the
model proposed here is only a first, but promising, proposal, where a lot of improvements
could be added to make it more precise and, possibly, useful. Also, it would be interesting
to try to improve the short time behavior, to better reproduce what happens in real life.
These are only part of our future projects.

Appendix 1: Few results on the CAR
We say that a set of operators {a` , a†` , ` = 1, 2, . . . , L} acting on an Hilbert space H satisfy
the CAR if the conditions
{a` , a†n } = δ`n 11,

{a` , an } = {a†` , a†n } = 0

hold true for all `, n = 1, 2, . . . , L. Here, 11 is the identity operator and {x, y} := xy + yx
is the anticommutator of x and y. These operators are used to describe L different modes
P
of fermions. From these operators we can construct n̂` = a†` a` and N̂ = L`=1 n̂` , which
are both self–adjoint. In particular, n̂` is the number operator for the `–th mode, while
N̂ is the global number operator.
An orthonormal basis for H is constructed as follows: we introduce the vacuum of
the theory, that is a vector ϕ0 which is annihilated by all the operators a` : a` ϕ0 = 0 for
all ` = 1, 2, . . . , L. Such a non zero vector surely exists. Then we act on ϕ0 with the
operators a†` (but not with higher powers, since these powers are simply zero!):
ϕn1 ,n2 ,...,nL := (a†1 )n1 (a†2 )n2 · · · (a†L )nL ϕ0 ,
n` = 0, 1 for all `. These vectors form the orthonormal basis we were looking for,
and are eigenstates of both n̂` and N̂ : n̂` ϕn1 ,n2 ,...,nL = n` ϕn1 ,n2 ,...,nL and N̂ ϕn1 ,n2 ,...,nL =
19

N ϕn1 ,n2 ,...,nL , where N =

PL

`=1

n` . Moreover, using the CAR, we deduce that

n̂` (a` ϕn1 ,n2 ,...,nL ) = (n` − 1)(a` ϕn1 ,n2 ,...,nL )
and


n̂` a†` ϕn1 ,n2 ,...,nL = (n` + 1)(a†l ϕn1 ,n2 ,...,nL ),
for all `. Then a` and a†` are called the annihilation and the creation operators. Notice
that, in some sense, a†` is also an annihilation operator since, acting on a state with
n` = 1, we destroy that state.
Of course, H has a finite dimension. In particular, for just one mode of fermions,
dim(H) = 2.

Appendix 2: few closed formulas
There are cases in which the functions in (2.8) can be computed analytically and assume
a reasonable closed form. For instance, if we take ωj = 0 for j = 1, 2, 3 and σB,2 = 0,
then, by setting
