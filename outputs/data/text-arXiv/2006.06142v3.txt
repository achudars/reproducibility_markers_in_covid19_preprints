Gender disparity in the authorship of biomedical research
publications during the COVID-19 pandemic
Abstract
Background: Gender imbalances in academia have been evident historically and
persist today. For the past 60 years, we have witnessed the increase of participation
of women in biomedical disciplines, showing that the gender gap is shrinking.
However, preliminary evidence suggests that women, including female researchers,
are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of unequal
distribution of childcare, elderly care and other kinds of domestic and emotional
labor. Sudden lockdowns and abrupt shifts in daily routines have disproportionate
consequences on their productivity, which is reflected by a sudden drop in research
output in biomedical research, consequently affecting the number of female authors
of scientific publications.
Objective: The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the COVID-19
pandemic has a disproportionate adverse effect on the productivity of female
researchers in biomedical field in terms of authorship of scientific publications.
Methods: This is a retrospective observational bibliometric study. We investigate
the proportion of male and female researchers who published scientific papers
during the COVID-19 pandemic, using bibliometric data from biomedical preprint
servers and selected Springer-Nature journals. We use the Ordinary Least Squares
(OLS) regression model to estimate the expected proportions over time by
correcting for temporal trends. We also use a set of statistical methods such as
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test and Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to test
the validity of results.
Results: A total of 78,950 papers from bioRxiv, medRxiv and 62 selected SpringerNature journals by 346,354 unique authors were analyzed. The acquired dataset
consisted of papers that were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2,
2020. The proportion of women first authors publishing in biomedical field during
the pandemic drops on average 9.1% across disciplines (expected arithmetic mean
𝑦̅𝑒𝑠𝑡 = 0.39; observed arithmetic mean 𝑦̅ = 0.35; standard error of the estimate,
̅ = 0.007; standard error of the observation, 𝜎𝑥̅ = 0.004). The impact is

particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19 research, where the
proportion of female scientists in the first author position drops by 28% (𝑦̅𝑒𝑠𝑡 =

last author decreased by 18.8% (𝑦̅𝑒𝑠𝑡 = 0.25; 𝑦̅ = 0.21; 𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑡
Further, by geocoding authors’ affiliations, we show that the gender disparities
become even more apparent when disaggregated by the country, up to 35% in some
cases.
Conclusions: Our findings document a decrease in the number of publications by
female authors in biomedical field during the global pandemic. This effect is
particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19, indicating that women are
producing fewer publications related to COVID-19 research. This sudden increase in
the gender gap is persistent across the ten countries with the highest number of
researchers. These results should be used to inform the scientific community of the
worrying trend in COVID-19 research and the disproportionate effect that the
pandemic has on female academics.

Introduction
As of the date of this writing, the COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of
thousands of lives worldwide and disrupted almost all aspects of human society. The
socio-economic impacts of the pandemic are yet to be assessed and the impending
economic crisis and recession are becoming evident.[1–3] During the recessions,
men are more likely to lose their job as men work in industries which are heavily
affected by the slowdown in economic activity such as manufacturing and
construction. Compared to previous economic crises, the current crisis has
disproportionately affected female workers. [4–11] One of the reasons for such
disparity is women’s over-representation in occupations in industries that are most
affected by the closures and movement restrictions, such as restaurants and
hospitality. Another large part of gender disparity is related to the unequal division
of labor in the household, as women are traditionally expected to continue to devote
more time to child care and domestic chores than their partners. [4] In case of the
dual-earner, heterosexual married couples with children the partners have
unequally adjusted their work time during the pandemic. Mothers with young
children have reduced their work hours four to five times more than fathers
contributing to the increased gender gap in earnings. [5] Working mothers affected
by the unequal distribution of working hours and the additional burden of domestic
chores have reported lower work productivity and job satisfaction than men. [6]
Stay-at-home orders, lockdowns and school closures have affected scientists as well,
especially those caring for children or other family members. [12,13] Female
scientists reported that their ability to devote time to their research has been
substantially affected, and the impact is most pronounced for female scientists with

young dependents. [14] The sudden shift in daily activities makes it hard to balance
between increasing professional requirements and childcare.
As a result, the research productivity of female scientists appears to have decreased.
[15–18] Early evidence suggests that the proportion of publications with female
authors is lower during the pandemic with the evident gendered authorship
disparities in journal submissions. [19,20] Reports from journal editors in the fields
of International Studies, Political Science, Economics, Medicine, and Philosophy
indicate that the proportion of submissions authored by women, in most cases has
dropped. [21] Even though while female academics are still submitting manuscripts
for publication during the crisis, they are submitting less of their own work than
men. [22]
A similar effect has been observed with publications on preprint servers. The
proportion of female authors publishing on the most popular economics preprint
servers is lower than expected, [23,24] with only 14.6 percent of female authors,
whereas comparably, they usually make up about 20 percent of authors in these
databases. Similarly, women publish less in other disciplines such as physics, earth
science and sociology. [25] In regards to medical and related sciences, on top of the
exacerbated gender disparity in publishing during the pandemic, the proportion of
female scientists publishing research specifically about COVID-19 is much lower
than expected, by almost 23%. [25–27]
Motivated by the ongoing research efforts, we expand on the previous research by
analyzing the large bibliographic dataset in biomedical field; we also employ
different modelling techniques that can further improve our understanding of this
phenomenon. The aim of this study is to quantify how COVID-19 exacerbates the
gender gap in scientific publishing in biomedical field.

Materials and Methods
Data
The bibliometric data on published papers are collected from three separate
sources: 1) bioRxiv (51,171 papers and 225,110 authors), provided by the Rxivist,
the API provider for bioRxiv publications; [28] 2) medRxiv (8,845 papers and 52,364
authors), scraped directly from medrxiv.org; 3) Springer-Nature (19,525 papers and
91,257 authors) data from 62 journals collected using the Springer-Nature
OpenAccess API. Springer-Nature data includes high-impact journals such as Nature
Genetics, Nature Medicine and Nature Immunology, as well as multiple BMC journals
such as BMC Bioinformatics and BMC Genomics. We include the data from all journals
in biomedical field that Springer-Nature provides data for. A complete list of journals
used in the analysis is available in Multimedia Appendix 1, Table S7. All the papers
from the dataset were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2, 2020. The
earliest publication on medRxiv is from June 25, 2019.
For each source, we collect the relevant meta-data. For each paper in bioRxiv and
medRxiv, we keep the date of publishing. For Springer-Nature journals, we keep the
date of manuscript submission, which is the most comparable date to publication
dates in bioRxiv and medRxiv. We additionally store the title and the abstract of the
papers as well as the scientific discipline of the paper. There is a total of 112
scientific disciplines in the data, and each paper belongs to a single discipline. The
complete list of all disciplines is provided in the Multimedia Appendix 1, Table S11.
For each author, we preserve the name, affiliation and the authorship order. We
remove the papers with group authors, such as scientific consortiums and projects
(~𝟎. 𝟏% of all papers), as they do not represent individuals. We use socio-economic
data on countries, including their respective GDP per capita provided by Our World
in Data (ourworldindata.org).
Identifying authors’ gender
To infer each author's gender from their name, we use a state-of-the-art tool, namely
the genderize.io API. [29] Given an input name, the model returns a gender and a
confidence score between 0.5 and 1. The uncertainty is greater for Asian names that
often are not gender-specific. [30] We filter out all authors for which the confidence
score is lower than 0.8. Overall, 19% of names yields a score below this threshold,
with Chinese and Korean topping the ranking with 54% and 41%,’ respectively.
In our dataset, we identify the most likely gender of the 466,836 authors in total. Out
of these, the gender of 348,506 unique authors (214,095 male and 134,411 female)
could be inferred with high accuracy with a genderize’s confidence score higher than
0.8, which is 74% of all authors.
Identifying authors’ country
To identify each author’s country in the bioRxiv and medRxiv dataset, we first locate a
toponym in the author's affiliation and assign the most likely country code to a given
toponym. If there is no toponym, we query the GRID.ac database and find the
institution with the most similar name and assign the institution's country to the

author. Additionally, we manually check the location of the most common affiliation
names from the dataset that covers most of the authors. The country of
approximately 80% of all authors was determined using this method. The country of
the authors in Springer-Nature dataset was already provided by the API.
Identifying COVID-19 papers
The papers that deal specifically with COVID-19 and similar topics are identified by
the set of keywords that appear in the title or in the abstract.
Calculating the differences between the expected and observed proportions
To measure the discrepancy between the expected and the observed proportion of
female authors, we first establish the baselines, which are the expected proportions
of female researchers that appear as the authors of publications. The expected
proportions are calculated using the OLS model and historical data from January
2019 to March 2020 (see Model). We then calculate the true observed proportions of
female authors who published during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and compare
it to the expected baselines. The error for the predicted value is the mean standard
error of the prediction. The error of the observed value is calculated as the standard
error of the mean 𝑆𝐸 = 𝜎/√𝑛. The percentage change is calculated as 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 =
(𝑓 𝑒𝑥𝑝 − 𝑓 𝑜𝑏𝑠 )/𝑓 𝑒𝑥𝑝 , where the 𝑓 𝑒𝑥𝑝 is the expected proportion and 𝑓 𝑜𝑏𝑠 is the
observed proportion. The errors for the percentage change in Figure 3 are calculated
as the total sum of the errors of predicted and observed values.
Model
Using historical data before March 15, 2020, we calculate the proportion of female
authors publishing each week. We fit an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
model 𝑓 = 𝛽𝑡 + 𝑐, where 𝑓 is the proportion of female authors that serves as a
response variable, 𝑡 is the predictor variable - time of publication/submission (to the
nearest week), 𝛽 and 𝑐 are the slope and the intercept. We fit the separate models
depending on the level of disaggregation (country, publisher, ...). The model is
illustrated in Figure 1. From the model, we derive the expected fraction 𝑓 𝐸𝑥𝑝 =
∑ 𝑓̂/𝑛 that is the mean fraction of all predicted values for the observed period and
𝑓 𝑂𝑏𝑠 = ∑ 𝑓𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 /𝑛. To estimate the expected number of papers and authors, we use a
similar approach, where the response variables are the numbers of papers and
authors rather than the proportion of female authors. We use statsmodels [31]
package in Python for this purpose.

Figure 1. Statistical model. Schematic illustration of the OLS model used to calculate the expected numbers and
proportions.

The OLS model tends to weight equally all data points regardless of the number of
samples. To guarantee the validity of the statistical analysis, we establish the
conditions under which the data points will be evaluated. The number of data points
used to fit the OLS before March 2020 and the number of data points after March
2020 are at least 10 each. This way, we limit the impact of small-sample
observations that can skew the estimate.
We additionally evaluate the model by applying the generalized linear model with
binomial errors and a logit link function, as the OLS could overestimate the
proportions in binary variables. Both models perform similarly, and the OLS model
did not provide any out-of-norm estimates. For the sake of better interpretability
and consistency with modeling the nominal number of authors and papers, we
decide to use the OLS model.
To better capture the productivity of the population, we count each publication of
the author separately, effectively modeling the proportion of papers authored by the
population of female authors. Considering that multiple authorships in the observed
period are relatively rare (less than 5% of all first authors and less than 10% of all
last authors have more than one paper), we consider each authorship independently.

Regression discontinuity design
To estimate the potential causal effects of the pandemic on the proportion of female
researchers, we devise a typical non-parametric regression discontinuity design
with a local linear regression in time, with the general form:

𝑌 = 𝛼 + 𝜏𝐷 + 𝛽1 (𝑋 − 𝑐) + 𝛽2 𝐷(𝑋 − 𝑐) + 𝜖
where 𝑐 is the treatment cutoff and 𝐷 is a binary variable equal to one if 𝑋 ≥ 𝑐. In
our case, we assume the date 𝑐 of a policy change that is mid-March 2020. For all
dates 𝑡 > 𝑐, the unit is treated, and for all dates 𝑡 < 𝑐, the unit is not. This regression
discontinuity setup uses time-series data, and in this case, weekly observations, both
globally and on a country level. By comparing observations lying closely on either
side of the temporal threshold, we estimate the average treatment effect. We make
sure to focus on observations not too far (in time) from the threshold, avoiding
potential bias from unobservable confounders. [32]
The falsification (or placebo) tests are performed by using fake cutoffs before and
after mid-March 2020 and comparing the treatment effect. We identify the optimal
cutoff point 𝑐0 as the point in time when the treatment effect is the most prominent,
𝑐0 = 𝑐|max (|𝜏|). The regression discontinuity design has been implemented using
the rdd package in Python. [33]

Results
The gender gap in research during the COVID-19 pandemic
Overall, during the pandemic, scientists posted papers on preprint servers at an
increasing rate. On average, we observe 31.2% more papers than expected and a
41.6% increase in the number of authors (39.2% increase for females and 42.9%
increase for males). Despite the absolute increase in the numbers of papers and
authors across publishers (see Multimedia Appendix 1, Figure S1, Tables S1, S2 and
S3), the proportion of female authors is lower than expected.
In biology, medicine and related disciplines, the most active contributors are usually
listed first. The author listed last is the most senior author, typically the head of the
lab. To address the high variability of the number of authors on the publications (𝜇 =
7.4, σ = 9.2 ), we analyze separately the proportion of women who appear as the
first author, the last author, an author regardless of the authorship order and as the
solo author. Additionally, we perform a separate analysis on the papers with topics
that are related directly to COVID-19.

The aggregate results suggest that the proportion of female authors publishing on all
topics as the first author decreased by 9.1% (expected arithmetic mean 𝑦̅𝑒𝑠𝑡 = 0.38;
̅ = 0.007;
observed arithmetic mean 𝑦̅ = 0.35; standard error of the estimate, 𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑡
standard error of the observation, 𝜎𝑥̅ = 0.004). The percentage drop becomes
unusually prominent when we analyze the papers about COVID-19. The proportion
of female scientists who write on COVID-19 related topics as the first author is lower
̅ = 0.007; 𝜎𝑥̅ = 0.007). When considering the last
by 28% (𝑦̅𝑒𝑠𝑡 = 0.38; 𝑦̅ = 0.27; 𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑡
authors, the proportion of women writing about COVID-19 decreased by 18.8%
̅ = 0.005; 𝜎𝑥̅ = 0.007). However, if we focus only on papers
(𝑦̅𝑒𝑠𝑡 = 0.25; 𝑦̅ = 0.2; 𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑡
that do not deal with COVID-19, we see a smaller change both for the first author
(2.3%) and the last author (4.4%). The proportion of women publishing papers on
topics other than COVID-19 on medRxiv increased on average 14%. The results are
shown in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 2. The expected proportions are plotted as
the green bars, and the true proportions are plotted in orange. The standard errors
of the aggregate analysis are represented as the vertical lines on top of the bars and
are relatively small (see Materials and Methods for details about the errors
calculation).

Figure 2. The comparison of the expected and observed proportion of female authors who publish during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Green bars represent the expected proportion of female authors, estimated by
the OLS model from the historical data from 2019. Orange bars are the observed proportion of female
authors that publish during the COVID-19 pandemic. The papers are divided by the topic in three groups:
1) all papers from the dataset; 2) the papers that deal directly with the COVID-19 and related topics; 3)
the papers that are not about COVID-19 or related topics. In the first row are the results from all
publishers combined. Other rows represent the results for each publisher separately.

Additionally, we focus our analysis on the papers with a single author and discover
̅ = 0.03; 𝜎𝑥̅ =
even greater disparity. We observe 34.5% (𝑦̅𝑒𝑠𝑡 = 0.21; 𝑦̅ = 0.13; 𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑡
0.008) fewer female solo authors during the pandemic publishing on all topics
across the platforms (see Multimedia Appendix 1, Figure S2). Similar disparity
appears in case of the solo authors publishing papers about COVID-19. Note that
only 3% of all papers are authored by a single author, hence the relatively large
standard errors of the both estimate and the observation, especially for papers
published on medRxiv. The effect still exists, although much less prominently, when

we observe all authors regardless of the order of authorship. More detailed
information is provided in Multimedia Appendix 1 in Table S1.
The results suggest that the aggregate gender disparity in academia during the
pandemic is due to the increased publication rate of papers about COVID-19
authored by men. To further explore this possibility, we track the individual
publication records and calculate the probability that the author will publish work
about COVID-19. Around 3.7% of men who have publication records in our dataset
will publish at least one paper about COVID-19, compared to ≈ 2.2% of women. Men
who already have a publication before the pandemic are 37% more likely to publish
a paper about COVID-19. This suggest that women are getting excluded from critical
research about COVID-19.
When disaggregated by publisher, the relative drop in the proportion of female first
authors for COVID-19 related research is 12.6%, 23.2% and 2.1% for bioRxiv,
medRxiv and Springer-Nature journals respectively (Figure 2). Similar disparity is
observed for the last authors with a relative drop of 20.1%, 30.8% and 23.6% and
the authors regardless of the authorship order with a relative drop of 2.2%, 10.7%
and 16.1%. In the case of solo papers, the average drop across the platforms is
34.5%. The proportion of females publishing on topics other than COVID-19 remains
within the standard error of the estimate, without the strong evidence of decrease.
Note the large standard errors in the estimated proportion of women for COVID-19
related papers in Springer-Nature journals due to the lack of data. Only published
papers have meta-data available through the Springer-Nature API, and many papers
submitted during the pandemic that will ultimately be published have not yet been
accepted and published (see Materials and Methods).
Additionally, we check if there was a significant change in the proportion of women
authors that occurred in mid-March 2020. To test the hypothesis, we perform a
regression discontinuity design analysis in time (see Materials and Methods). We
estimate a vertical discontinuity of the proportion of women over time by the
coefficient 𝜏 at the cutoff point 𝑐0 = March 15, 2020. For all the papers, regardless of
the topic, we get 𝜏 = −0.008 with 𝑝 = 0.03. However, considering only the papers
about COVID-19, the discontinuity becomes clearer with 𝜏 = −0.049 and 𝑝 < 0.005.
To assert the robustness of our model, we perform a placebo test (see Materials and
Methods) to confirm that the discontinuity is likely aligned with the start of the
pandemic and that it happened at or around March 2020, and not during any time in
2019. When RDD analysis is performed at the country level, we confirm that for most
countries, the cutoff threshold falls between mid-March and mid-April 2020 (see
Multimedia Appendix 1 Table S7). The RDD analysis suggests that there was a drop
in the proportion of female authors in the beginning of April 2020 that was more
significant than any other fluctuation that occurred in 2019 or after April 2020.
Further, we check if we can confidently use the proportion of women who published
before the pandemic as the reference to estimate the proportion of women to
publish papers specifically about COVID-19. A hypothesis is that before the

pandemic, women can be less likely to be represented in the scientific disciplines
that will produce COVID-19 research. To check that, we first perform a chi-squared
test on the distribution of disciplines involved in COVID-19 research. We discover
that some disciplines, such as infectious diseases, epidemiology, public and global
health are over-represented (𝑝 < 0.01). Then, we test if the proportions of women in
COVID-19 disciplines are significantly different from non-COVID-19 disciplines. By
performing the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, we compare the distributions of the
proportion of women across two groups of disciplines and we obtain 𝑝 = 0.84. We
conclude that the two groups were sampled from populations with the same
distributions, and we can be confident that we can use the data on the proportion of
women before the pandemic to model the proportion of women that publish about
COVID-19.
Some trends during the pandemic
To assess the temporal trends during the pandemic, we build the linear model
𝑓(𝑡) = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑡 + 𝜖, where 𝑓(𝑡) is the proportion of female scientist, and 𝑡 is the time
in weeks after mid March 2020. The regression coefficient 𝛽 is used to quantify the
trend. We did not identify a significant change in the proportion of female first
authors (Table 2). However, we observe a small but significant increase in the
proportion of female scientists appearing as the last author (β = 0.001, p < 0.01 )
and an author regardless of authorship order (β = 0.001, p < 0.01). An even
stronger positive trend is observed for the COVID-19 related research for the last
author (β = 0.003, p < 0.01) and an author regardless of authorship order with 𝛽 =
0.005 (Multimedia Appendix 1, Table S8).

Country-level Analysis
We identify the most likely country of authors based on their affiliation (see
Materials and Methods) and measure the difference between the expected and
observed proportion of female authors during the pandemic. Figure 3 shows the
pandemic-related gender gap across the countries with the largest share of the
authors. The values represent percentage differences between the expected and
observed fraction of female authors publishing in bioRxiv, medRxiv and selected
Springer-Nature journals between March and August 2020. Points to the left
(orange) of the mid-line represent countries with less than expected fraction of

female authors, and points to the right of the mid-line (in green) represent an
increase in the fraction of female authors. The left plot is for all papers regardless of
topic, the middle plot is only for COVID-19 related papers and the right plot is only
for the papers that are not related to COVID-19. More detailed information is
provided in Multimedia Appendix 1 in Tables S4-S6.

Figure 3. Percentage drop in proportion of female authors during the pandemic across the countries.
Orange points mark the percentage decrease in proportion of female authors. Green points mark the increase.
Horizontal lines are standard errors. The analysis is divided by the topic in three groups: 1) all papers from the
dataset; 2) the papers that deal directly with the COVID-19 and related topics; 3) the papers that are not about
COVID-19 or related topics. Missing points indicate insufficient sample size.

A significant drop in the proportion of female first authors is consistent across the
countries. Regardless of the topic, we observe a 24.9% drop in Italy (𝑦̅𝑒𝑠𝑡 =
̅ = 0.046; 𝜎𝑥̅ = 0.024), followed by Canada (19.7%), Sweden
0.526; 𝑦̅ = 0.395; 𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑡

(15.9%), Japan (14.5%), India (13.4%) and France (11.1%). For the research dealing
explicitly with the topic of COVID-19 (Figure 3, middle panel), we observe a greater
gender gap than with the papers on other research topics (Figure 3, right panel). In
Germany, for example, the relative drop in the proportion of female first authors is
̅ = 0.02; 𝜎𝑥̅ = 0.027), indicating that male scientists
36% (𝑦̅𝑒𝑠𝑡 = 0.39; 𝑦̅ = 0.25; 𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑡
affiliated with German institutions are publishing disproportionately more than
their female colleagues about COVID-19. Similar considerations apply to India,
France, Italy, Great Britain, Canada and the United States. The opposite is true for
Japan, where the proportion of women publishing about COVID-19 as the first
author increases by 23.7%. Similar disparity applies to the last authors (Figure 3,
second row). Missing points indicate that there was not enough data from the
pandemic period to calculate the observed mean.
When we observe the proportion of female authors regardless of the authorship
order, the drop becomes less prominent but still consistent across the countries. For
example, in Canada, a drop in the proportion of female authors for COVID-19 related

sized drops for countries such as Germany, Italy, Great Britain, and France (Figure 3,
third row). On the other hand, there is an increase in the proportion of female
̅ =
authors writing about COVID-19 in Japan for 6% (𝑦̅𝑒𝑠𝑡 = 0.155; 𝑦̅ = 0.164; 𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑡
0.010; 𝜎𝑥̅ = 0.017). The increase in the proportion of female authors in China (2.4%)
is within the margin of error.
The gender gap for non-COVID-19 related research (Figure 3, right panel) exists
during the pandemic, but it is smaller than for COVID-19 research. Again, we observe
the stark differences among countries, with the proportion of female first authors
publishing during the pandemic significantly decreasing in Italy, Canada, Japan and
France. Note that the plots for the single author papers are missing as the samples
become too small when disaggregated by the country.

Figure 4. Gender disparity in research and the GDP. (Upper) The proportion of women active in research is
higher in countries with lower per capita GDP. (Lower) The proportion of female authors of research articles
decreased more than expected in countries with lower per capita GDP.

Further, we explore if there are any commonalities among the countries with respect
to the participation of women in research. Figure 4 illustrates the proportions of
female authors (upper panel) and the percentage change in the proportion of female
authors (lower panel). When disaggregated by region, we observe that the wealthier
countries—with higher per capita gross domestic product (GDP)—have
proportionally fewer female researchers, with Asian countries exhibiting the most
pronounced gender disparity. However, the countries with higher GDP per capita
demonstrate a smaller drop in the proportion of women publishing during the
pandemic.

Discussion
We analyze bibliographical data from biomedical preprint servers and SpringerNature journals and show that the fraction of women publishing during the COVID19 pandemic drops significantly across disciplines and research topics. Since the
announcement of the global pandemic and the start of lockdowns, we observe a drop
of 9.1% in the number of women publishing biomedical scientific papers as the first
author. Women are significantly excluded from COVID-19 related research, as we
measure the 28% drop in female first authors in that area of research. That confirms
some earlier suggestions that female first authors contribute less to COVID-19
studies than to research in other areas. [25] Women remain underrepresented even
though we observe the increased publishing rate for both genders during the

pandemic. Similar disparity can be observed for the last authors as well as the soloauthored papers. The increased gender gap in publishing is persistent across the ten
countries with the highest number of researchers.
For the papers on topics other than COVID-19, we do not observe this high
discrepancy, and in the case of the medRxiv we observe more women than projected
by the model. The overall gender disparity in research during the pandemic is mostly
driven by the higher publication rate of papers on COVID-19 and related topics. It
seems that such research is conducted disproportionately by men, as male authors
are more likely to appear in first author positions on papers posted on preprint
servers and published in peer-reviewed journals.
It appears that the most significant drop in proportion of female authors happened
early into the pandemic. The proportion of women has been increasing gradually for
some authorship categories. Note that the observed gradual increase is statistically
significant but is very slow. One can think of a possible explanation for such a sudden
drop and a subsequent gradual increase is that most of the COVID papers published
early were various epidemic models focusing on cases and death counts. Many of the
authors’ affiliations were in departments of engineering, mathematics and physics
that might have a different proportion of women than the population of scientists in
biology and medicine. Since research in the biomedical field usually takes longer to
conduct and publish, it can lead to a shift in the gender distribution later. However,
this argument does not explain the phenomenon entirely, as the base gender gap in
STEM is not higher than in biology [30] and the later publications from the biologists
are not expected to narrow the gender gap. On the contrary, it might even increase it.
Another likely explanation of a sudden drop in the proportion of female authors is
that caregiving demands have exploded during the pandemic, and these have mostly
fallen on women. [12,34,35] These include childcare demands,[36] elderly care and
other kinds of domestic and emotional labor. Sudden lockdowns and other
preventive measures unevenly increased the burden on certain populations, causing
the productivity of female scientists to decrease. As the world started fighting off the
pandemic, people got used to the “new normal” and scientists started returning to
their routines. That can partially explain the gradual increase in the proportion of
female authors. Nevertheless, further research and more time is needed to
investigate the reasons for such a sudden drop and gradual revival of the proportion
of papers published by female scientists during the pandemic.
The global pandemic has touched almost every nation on the planet. Countries,
however, responded differently to contain the spread of the disease. The variability
of the measures and their timing, combined with differences in cultural norms and
outbreak severity, have had a variable impact on researchers across the world.
Country-level analysis better reveals global trends, as the aggregate data can be
skewed by countries with a disproportionately large number of publications such as
the United States, which has almost 29% of all authors in the data set (Multimedia
Appendix 1, Table S10). Additionally, our analysis can reveal regional, political and

cultural differences between the nations. It is known that gender disparities in
research are strongly associated with a country's wealth.[37] The wealthier
countries—with higher per capita gross domestic product (GDP)—have
proportionally fewer female researchers, with Asian countries exhibiting the most
pronounced gender disparity. However, the countries with higher GDP per capita are
more resilient to the effects of COVID-19 on gender imbalance. In addition, wealthier
countries show a smaller pandemic-related drop in women's participation in
research than poorer countries, with wealthier Asian countries experiencing an
increase in the proportion of active female researchers. This suggests that women
experience bigger life disruptions in poorer countries, which affects their
productivity. Additionally, women are more excluded from COVID-19 research in
poorer nations. This certainly should not imply any purpose or deliberate action, but
rather the disproportionate variations in the social environments across nations,
caused by the various expectations for the female member of the household.
Implications
Gender imbalances in academia have been evident historically and still persist today.
Various measures of research output, including the proportion of authors,
fractionalized authorships,[38] tenure decisions and number of research grants[39]
indicate the significant gender gap that is observed worldwide. For the past 60 years,
we have witnessed the increase of participation of women in science across scientific
disciplines[30] and lower levels of discrimination,[40] demonstrating that the
gender gap is shrinking over time.[41] Thus, a sudden drop in women’s research
output in biomedical research about COVID-19 appears as a surprising reverse
trend.
The factors that lead to such extreme and consistent differences in the proportion of
female scientists can be numerous. The already existing barriers for female
participation in science vary across countries. In some nations, men are more
favorably placed than women[42–45] and can be more likely to get quick funding for
COVID-19 related research. Additionally, traditional gender norms differ and can
affect the genders differently. Caregiving demands have mostly fallen on women.
New challenges at the same time bring new opportunities, and men who are likely to
engage in a more aggressive self-promotion[46,47] and pursue careers more
forcefully[41] can be motivated to push for faster publication. Identifying the exact
reasons for an increased gender gap can be an important topic for future studies.
The global pandemic caused this unforeseen crisis that will most certainly affect
academia. All the difficulties female scientists faced previously may possibly be
exacerbated by the extended lockdowns and sudden shift in work-life dynamics. It is
important to understand the impact of such an extraordinary circumstance on the
scientific community that will disproportionately affect research outputs as well as
prospects for tenure and promotions.[48] Future research evaluation practices
should be informed by our findings to account for and mitigate the penalizing effects
that COVID-19 is having on female researchers.

Strengths and limitations of study
The strengths of our study include the use of a relatively large and diverse dataset
from three different publishing platforms. The focus on preprint papers allows the
assessment of the observed effects in a timely manner. We focus on a structured and
rigorous statistical analysis, making sure that the results are significant. The data
and the code to reproduce the results are available.
Potential limitations warrant consideration. First, the gender of the author can be
wrongly identified. Even though we excluded the results that have a low confidence,
a small fraction of the authors can be misgendered. Additionally, we acknowledge
that automated gender classifiers do not recognize the various non-binary gender
identities[49] and assign the gender label based on the historical distribution of
typical male/female names. As awareness of the nature of gender and identify shift,
so may the number of researchers who do not identify within the binary categories
of male and female. Such researchers face additional layers of discrimination that
our study does not consider. While we understand that binary gender can be an
oversimplification that can introduce some amount of bias and inaccuracy, the
problem that we highlight hopefully can bring some attention to the multi-faceted
issue of gender, identity and discrimination. Second, the algorithm that identifies the
authors’ country relies on recognizing the names of the toponyms in the name of the
authors’ affiliated institution. Even though we make sure that the most popular
institutions are properly localized and we optimize the localization resolution, some
errors are possible. Third, throughout the paper, the word “productivity” is used to
refer to the rate of publication output of scientists in terms of publications per week
and it cannot capture changes to scientists’ other inputs. For example, female
scientists appearing less productive in terms of publications-per-week may simply
reflect that they are able to spend less time on their research, not capturing the
publications-per-hour-worked. We are aware that there are other preprint servers and
journals that publish papers in biomedical field. Analyzing the data from the two largest
preprint servers and the largest publisher of peer-reviewed papers, we aim to cover a
representative sample of papers and authors from the field. Finally, our analysis is
focused on the first six months of the pandemic and might not accurately evaluate
the effects that can be observed later in the pandemic.
Conclusion
Our findings document a decrease in the proportion of female authors in biomedical
field who published research papers during the global pandemic. This effect is
particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19, indicating that women are
producing fewer publications related to COVID-19 research. A sudden increase in
this gender gap is persistent across the ten countries with the highest number of
researchers. The results should be used to inform the scientific community of the
worrying trend in COVID-19 research and the disproportionate effect the pandemic
has on female academics’ research outputs.
