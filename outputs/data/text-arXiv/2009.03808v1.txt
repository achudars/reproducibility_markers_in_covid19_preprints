Abstract
The goal of this work is to consider widespread use of face masks as a nonpharmaceutical control strategy for the Covid-19 pandemic. A SEIR model
that divides the population into individuals that wear masks and those that
do not is considered. After calculating the basic reproductive number by a
next generation approach, a criterion for determining when an epidemic can be
prevented by the use of masks only and the critical percentage of mask users for
disease prevention in the population are derived. The results are then applied
to real world data from the United States, Brazil and Italy.
Keywords: Epidemics, Covid-19, Face masks, Non-pharmaceutical control
strategies, SEIR model.

1. Introduction
The Covid-19 crisis has created the biggest public health concerns of 2020.
Since being first reported at the end of 2019, the disease has caused over 23
million confirmed cases and 800 thousand deaths by the end of August 2020 [1].
Many studies to model the pandemic spread were developed (e.g. [2, 3, 4, 5])
with results influencing the policies of governments around the world.
Attempts to minimize the damage of the pandemic were then implemented,
such as mandatory mask use and quarantines, which improved the overall scenario, but so far there are no drugs or vaccines to treat or immunize people and
maintaining quarantines for longer time periods is not a viable option in some

communities. Therefore, looking for non-pharmaceutical control strategies is
essential to deal with this epidemic and others in the future.
This paper addresses this issue considering the widespread use of masks as
in other works such as [6, 7, 8, 9]. A SEIR model [10] with individuals divided
into those that wear masks and those that do not is considered in Section 2, and
its basic reproductive number is calculated by a next generation approach in
Section 3. This leads to a criterion that determines when an epidemic outbreak
can be avoided by mask use only, and a critical percentage of mask users in the
population is derived.
For applications of these methods, we perform the parameter fitting in Section 4 with data from the United States, Brazil and Italy and analyse whether
the Covid-19 crisis could have been avoided in these countries with widespread
mask use from the beginning of the outbreak. In addition, numerical simulations are carried out to verify how the evolution of the disease is mitigated if it
cannot be avoided. The conclusions are drawn in Section 5.
2. Model structure
Consider a population N that is divided into individuals that wear masks,
denoted by Nm and individuals that do not, denoted by Nn . Let p(t) be the
percentage of people wearing a mask in the population at time t ≥ 0, then
Nm (t) = p(t)N (t),

Nn (t) = (1 − p(t))N (t).

(1)

Both Nn and Nm are also divided into four epidemiological classes, consisting
of susceptible, exposed, infected and removed individuals, denoted by Sn and
Sm , En and Em , In and Im and Rn and Rm , respectively. As the model will
consider only a short time period in comparison to the demographic time frame,
vital parameters will be neglected, so the total population will be assumed
constant, that is,
N (t) = N.

(2)

Let r be a multiplicative factor for the transmission rate β that will take into
account the reduction in the probability of contagion from one person wearing
2

a mask in a susceptible-infected contact. We assume that this reduction is the
same whether a susceptible or an infective is wearing the mask. When only
one individual has a mask on, we assume that the new transmission rate is rβ.
In the case of both individuals with masks on, then the transmission rate is
assumed to be r2 β. There are four ways contagions can occur, and they are
described in Table 1.

We further assume that p(t) = p is constant, so Nm (t) and Nn (t) are also
constant. Hence, our model can be written as

The parameters σ and γ denote the exit rates from the exposed and infected
classes, respectively. It is typically assumed that σ = 1/Te and γ = 1/Ti ,
where Te and Ti are the mean lengths of the latency and infectious periods,
respectively.

3. The basic reproductive number and some consequences
Now, the basic reproductive number, R0 , of model (3) is calculated. This
will be done by a next generation approach (see [11, 12]). R0 is given by the
spectral radius of
K = F V −1 ,
where

Note that (3) reduces to (6) if either p = 0 (nobody wears masks) or r = 1 (the
masks offer no protection against the disease).
Since both p, r2 ∈ [0, 1], it is clear that R0 > 0 and that R0 ≤ R0 , with the
equality in the cases p = 0 or r = 1, when the model (3) reduces to model (6).
The level set R0 = 1 in (4) is displayed in Figure 1 for R0 = 5, along with the
regions of R0 < 1 and R0 > 1.

Figure 1: The level set of R0 = 1 for R0 = 5 in the rp plane.

We now look for conditions the pair (r, p) should satisfy in order for this
point to lie in the region of R0 < 1. Notice that, for fixed r ∈ [0, 1], R0 is a
decreasing function of p (see Figure 2). For p = 0, we have R0 = R0 , and for
p = 1, we have R0 = R1 , where
R1 = R0 · r2 .

(7)

It is assumed that R0 > 1. Then, it is clear from Figure 2 that one can find
values of p such that R0 < 1 if and only if R1 < 1, that is, if and only if
1
r< √ .
R0

(8)

Moreover, there is a critical value p∗ such that R0 (p∗ ) = 1, so R0 (p) < 1 if
and only if p > p∗ . Solving R0 = 1 in (4), one sees that

The value of p∗ corresponds to the critical percentage of the population that
should wear masks in order to avoid the epidemic outbreak. In the extreme case
of r = 0, i.e., the masks are ideal and avoid contamination for users, which is
the same as immunizing the population, (9) becomes
p∗ = 1 −

(10)

which coincides with the usual threshold for herd immunity [14].

4. Data fitting and numerical results
In this Section, we collect data from the United States, Brazil and Italy to
use as case studies for the results of the previous Section. The time frame in
consideration consists of the first 30 days after the cumulative number of cases in
each country reached 100, which happened in March 2, March 13 and February
23 for the US, Brazil and Italy, respectively. The data, which was retrieved from
[15], is displayed in Tables 2, 3 and 4.
We assume that the mean latency and recovery periods are 5.1 and 7 days,
respectively, as in [6]. We fit β by a minimization routine based on the least
squares method, available in [11], in the standard SEIR model without vital

dynamics (6). The routine minimizes the difference of the cumulative number
of cases, given by I(t) + R(t), and the data points.
The total populations of the USA, Brazil and Italy will be rounded to 331,
209 and 60 million, respectively. These numbers will be taken as the initial
values of susceptible individuals in each country. In the first days of each data
8

set, the numbers of active cases (see [15]) were 85, 150 and 152 for the USA,
Brazil and Italy, respective, so the initial conditions for infected and removed
individuals will be taken, respectively, as 85 and 15 for the USA, 150 and 1 for
Brazil and 152 and 5 for Italy.
For the initial values of exposed individuals, we use the fact that the latency
period is taken as 5.1 days, so we look at the number in day 6 of each data set
and choose the initial number of exposed as the extra number of cases since day
1. Hence, these numbers are 335 in the USA, 378 in Brazil and 732 in Italy. A
summary of the initial conditions for each country in the minimization routine
is shown in Table 5.

Starting with an initial guess of β = 0.5, the fitted values of β are, then,

βIT = 0.5809.

Using (5), we can calculate its value for each country. The results are displayed in Table 6.

According to [16], when both individuals wear masks in a susceptible-infected
contact, there is an average reduction of 82.18% in the transmission, so
r2 = 1 − 0.8218 = 0.1782,
9

hence r = 0.4221. Then, the result of one person wearing a mask when two
individuals meet is a decrease of around 58% in the transmission coefficient.
Rewriting (8), we see that the outbreak can be avoided by a widespread use
of masks is

According to Table 6, the Covid-19 crisis could have been avoided in Brazil and
in Italy, and according to (9), this would be possible if at least 85.87% and
91.76% of all individuals wore masks, respectively.
On the other hand, Table 6 indicates that Covid-19 could not have been
avoided in the USA by widespread mask use only, but the basic reproductive
number could be lowered from R0 = 6.0039 to R1 = 1.0699, so other a combination with control measures such as social distancing, quarantines and tracking
infected cases could be able to prevent the disease outbreak. This could also be
done by improving the average mask protection.
Moreover, one could also calculate the normalized forward sensitivity index
(or elasticity) of R0 with respect to p (see [11, 17]), given by
0
ΥR
p =

∂R0 p
·
,
∂p R0

(12)

This number provides the percentage change in R0 for a given percentage
0
change in p. For example, if ΥR
p = −0.5, then a 10% increase in p produces a

5% decrease in R0 . By (4) and (12), we have

A plot of ΥR
p as a function of p is displayed in Figure 3. It shows that R0

becomes very sensitive to p for bigger values of this parameter, so even if most
of a community has already become adept to wearing masks, small increases in
p could still contribute greatly to epidemic control.
We now assess the effect of variations in p on the numbers of infected caused
by Covid-19 in the case of the USA. A comparison of the total infected curve

where N = 331 million, is displayed in Figure 4 for a time period of one year.
The desired ”flattening of the curve“, i.e., postponing and lowering the maximum number of cases, is achieved. A closer look at this fact is shown in Figure
5, which shows that, in a period of one year, both the maximum and the time
it happens stabilize after p ≈ 0.86. For these values of p, plots like the ones
in Figure 4 would only reach their peak after one year, so we can say that the
disease is essentially controlled.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, a SEIR model is considered in a population that is divided into
individuals that wear masks and individuals that do not. Parameters p and r,
which represent the (constant) percentage of the population that are mask users
and the reduction in the transmission rate due to one person wearing a mask in

a susceptible-infected contact, respectively, are introduced, and their effect on
the basic reproductive number is calculated by a next generation method.
This allows for the derivation of a necessary and sufficient condition for
epidemic outbreaks to be prevented only by the widespread use of masks. When
12

this is possible, a critical percentage p∗ of mask users in the population necessary
for disease control is calculated.
This is utterly important in dealing with public health crisis worldwide,
since pharmaceutical measures such as vaccines and drugs are more laborious
and take long times to be developed while diseases spread.
As case studies for the results in this paper, real world data from the Covid19 pandemic was used, focusing on the United States, Brazil and Italy for the
first 30 days after the total number of cases reached 100. After fitting the
parameters, the results implied that the Covid-19 epidemic could have been
avoided in Brazil and Italy if at least 85.87% and 91.76% of the populations,
respectively, wore masks from the beginning of the outbreak.
Even though this was not possible in the case of the United States, we noted
that the basic reproductive number could have been reduced from 6.0039 to
1.0699, so other control measures such as social distancing, quarantines, or even
improving the average mask quality could help pushing this number below 1.
Furthermore, numerical simulations showed that the flattening of the infected curve is achieved as p gets closer to 1, and that the maximum of this
curve and the necessary time for it to happen stabilize after p ≈ 0.86, i.e.,
the disease is essentially controlled. Thus, simple measures such as wearing
masks can prove to be very effective in controlling, or even preventing, future
epidemics.
