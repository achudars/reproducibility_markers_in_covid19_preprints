Abstract
We study the reported data from the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in January - May 2020
in 119 countries. We observe that the time series of active cases in individual countries (the
difference of the total number of confirmed infections and the sum of the total number of reported deaths and recovered cases) display a strong agreement with polynomial growth and at
a later epidemic stage also with a combined polynomial growth with exponential decay. Our
results are also formulated in terms of compartment type mathematical models of epidemics.
Within these models the universal scaling characterizing the observed regime in an advanced
epidemic stage can be interpreted as an algebraic decay of the relative reproduction number R0
as TM /t, where TM is a constant and t is the duration of the epidemic outbreak. We show how
our findings can be applied to improve predictions of the reported pandemic data and estimate
some epidemic paramters. Note that although the model shows a good agreement with the reported data we do not make any claims about the real size of the pandemics as the relation of
the observed reported data to the total number of infected in the population is still unknown.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is accompanied by an unprecedented challenge for its mathematical modeling. Most of the difficulties stem in an extremely high level of uncertainty in available
data:
• Methodology for reporting of all types of data (number of confirmed positive cases, hospitalizations, recovered individuals, and even confirmed deaths) is not systematic and varies from
one country to another [1].
• Different types of tests and test protocols used for COVID-19 detection have their own limitations both in sensitivity and specificity; testing procedures differ in methodology of a sample
selection and in a testing sample size in different countries. In addition, different types of tests
detect different phases of individual infections and their results differ based on the clinical
stage of the infection [2].
• A relation of the reported data to the real (unobserved) number of infected in a population is
not understood and the estimates for the ratio of total cases in population to the number of
observed cases vary even in the order of magnitude [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
The extent of uncertainty in data prohibits designing and validating mathematical models that would
provide verifiable accurate description of dynamics of the pandemic. That in turn has serious consequences on pandemic spread control and efficient epidemiological decision making. Particular
1

2
difficulty for mathematical modeling is that traditional compartment type models, often referred to
as “SIR models” with Susceptible – Infected – Recovered compartments, that succeeded in an accurate description of previous epidemics, produce scenarios that do not match closely the observed
data [5, 11] and fail to capture significant trends observed in data, see also [12, 13] for other early
models. While it is still too early to call whether these models fail to capture the real dynamics
of pandemics (as the observed data may not completely correspond to number of infected in the
whole population) there is an urgent need to understand the available data and its relation to the SIR
models.

1.1

Note of precaution

We consider very important to emphasize the limited scope of our analysis as in the current literature
some of these limitations are blurred and may eventually lead to misinterpretations. To overcome
the difficulties with mathematical modeling and a high degree of uncertainty in data we propose
a simple descriptive model that captures the dynamics of the observed data rather than a detailed
mechanistic model of the pandemic dynamics in the whole population. Therefore our results need
to be interpreted with high precaution. We only present a systematic mathematical description of
the observed reported data. We provide neither an explanation of the pandemics spreading, nor any
claim about the real scope of the pandemics. However, if one conjectures that the observed reported
data capture the extent of the pandemic size in the real population (e.g., if data systematically report
a fixed percentage of the total infected population), then our results can be used to identify the
nature of the emerging trends in pandemics spreading in individual countries. Furthermore, we
only model the first wave of the pandemic and we do not make any predictions about the extent
and timing of next waves, although we discuss how our method can be used to study effect of next
epidemic waves. We are aware that we ignore multiple key factors that may influence the relation
between the observed data and the real epidemic size (the level of detection of infected by testing,
delays in test reporting, variation in clinical aspects of the infection, etc.). Note that in the text we
use the term COVID-19 for all reported infections based on a positive PCR test and thus we do not
distinguish between the presence of the virus in the respiratory tract of an infected and the disease it
causes. Through the whole text we model the time series of the total number of active cases that is
the difference of the reported total number of confirmed infections and the sum of the total number
of reported deaths and recovered cases.

1.2

Our work

We have identified a universal trend in the data reported by individual countries that helps to improve
predictions for the final observed epidemic size and the related time scales. The universal trend is
observed despite inhomogeneities and uncertainties in the data time series and various types and
levels of mitigation policies applied. There is a transition in time series from an exponential growth
(EG) to a polynomial growth (PG) and at a later stage to a combined polynomial growth with an
exponential decay (PGED) in the number of active cases across almost all countries world-wide
(with a sufficient size of current data). Our choice of the form of the trend in data is motivated by
the theoretical results of [14, 15, 16, 17] and by the data analysis performed in [18, 19] that relate
the observed transition to structural changes in the population contact networks.
We analyze the reported data and estimate the parameters for individual countries. This allows
us to categorize the countries into groups according to their advance through the first wave of the
pandemics, and also to detect a possible divergence into a possible upcoming second wave in some
countries. We rank a selected group of countries according to one of model parameters that captures
their ability to identify, test, and isolate infected individuals from the rest of the population and thus
prevent further spreading. We also provide a reconciliation of the PGED regime with the SIR
model that allows to build PGED directly into existing SIR models despite the fact that PGED is
inconsistent with the SIR models (in their traditional form). The PGED regime corresponds to an
explicit algebraic decay of the relative reproduction number R0 in time t in the form R0 ≈ TM /t

3
with a constant TM . The trend is in general agreement with the current estimates of the evolution of
R0 in many individual countries [20]; see also [21] for a data supporting the observed dependence.
A model based on PGED regime can also aid forecasting of the future dynamics of the observed
data including an analysis of eventual next epidemic waves.

Compartment Based Model in Epidemiology (SIR Model)

The keystones of mathematical modeling of epidemic spread are the compartment based models
also referred to as SIR models introduced by Kermack and McKendrick [22, 23, 24], see also
[25, 26] for an extensive literature overview. We only review basic properties of the SIR model
relevant for our further analysis.
The basic SIR model describes the dynamics of susceptible (S = S(t)), infected (I = I(t)),
and recovered (R = R(t)) populations at time t by the coupled system of ordinary differential
equations

γI .

(3)

Here N is the total population, β > 0 is the infection rate, and γ > 0 is the removal rate of
infections. The key assumptions behind this mechanistic model are
• the total population N = S + I + R is constant,
• the population is well mixed, thus likelihood of a contact and transmission of the infection
from any infected to any susceptible is the same,
• the populations S, I and R are large enough to be well approximated by the real variable
instead of integers.
The basic model can be readily extended to account for an incubation period (SEIR model), for age
structured and geographically structured populations, etc. Also, the assumption of the constant total
population can be removed. However, the well mixed population assumption cannot be completely
removed unless one considers SIR models on networks. In that case a good knowledge of the
underlying contact network is necessary to calibrate the model to any type of data.

2.1

Relative reproduction number

The current extent of epidemic spread in the system is typically measured by the relative reproduction number R0 = R0 (t) that is related to the instantaneous rate of growth of the infected
population. Equation 2 can be written as dI/dt = γ(R0 − 1)I for
R0 =

β S
.
γ N

Thus R0 = 1 corresponds to the epidemic peak, the tipping point that characterizes the moment
when the population of infected individuals is stationary, dI/dt = 0.1 Note that dI/dt > 0 for
R0 > 1 and dI/dt < 0 for R0 < 1 (for I > 0). For practical reasons related to the COVID-19
outbreak it is useful to rewrite the expression for R0 as
R0 = β s Tinf ,
1

(4)

In epidemiology literature the basic reproduction number R0 is typically defined as R0 = β/γ and then the basic
reproduction number that is constant during the epidemic outbreak is compared with the relative size of the susceptible
population s = S/N to quantify the present speed of spreading.

4
Here s = s(t) = S(t)/N is the proportion of the infected in the population at time t. The time scale
Tinf is associated with the removal of an average individual from the infected population, i.e., the
typical length of the period during which the infected individual infects the susceptible population.
It is related to γ by Tinf = 1/γ. The infection rate β can be expressed as β = p/Tsus , where Tsus is
the typical time scale associated with occurrence of interactions between susceptible and infected
in the population where infection transfer may happen. The total number of transmission contacts
between susceptible and infected population is given by sI/Tsus . Finally, p is the probability of
infection of a susceptible individual through a single random meeting with an infected.

2.2

Epidemic control

In the SIR model the number of active cases decreases due to a decrease of R0 below 1. As β and
Tinf are constant it is achieved through a reduction of the proportion of the susceptible population
s below the threshold 1/(βTinf ). That in general requires a significant decrease of the susceptible
population through vaccination, gained natural immunity, infection (herd immunity) or through a
long term quarantine of a large fraction of the susceptible population. However, the pandemic size
apparently has not reached such a high level yet. Thus R0 needs to be controlled through a decrease
in β or Tinf . The parameter β is an obvious candidate as strict public mitigation measures and
social distancing decrease p and increase Tsus . These measures are typically associated with a large
economic cost and also parameters of this structural change on the level of the contact network
are still unknown and their direct effect on R0 cannot be accurately quantified. A decrease of the
parameter Tinf does not require widespread mitigation measures. Although ability to decrease Tinf
solely based on the observation of disease symptoms is limited from below by the length of the
incubation period, Tinf can be significantly reduced by active contact tracing.

3

Exponential Growth Regime (EG)

Until mitigation measures are applied we expect that an epidemic outbreak is governed by the
SIR model 1–3. That implies an exponential growth (EG) of I = I(t) during the early stages of
epidemic. For completeness we present the asymptotic behavior of (S, I, R) in 1–3 for t → 0+ .
Let R00 = R0 (0) and (S(0), I(0), R(0)) = (S0 , I0 , 0). Then S(t) ≈ S0 for t  1 and 2 reduces
to dI/dt ≈ γ(R00 − 1)I, i.e.,


I(t) ≈ I0 exp γ(R00 − 1)t .
Consequently from 3 and S + I + R = N we obtain

R(t) ≈
exp γ(R00 − 1)t − 1 , S(t) ≈ N −
I0 exp γ(R00 − 1)t ,
R00 − 1
R00 − 1
that is consistent with 1. Note that EG was not observed in data in multiple countries (e.g., Slovakia,
Lithuania) as these countries introduced mitigation measures at very early stages of the epidemic
(zero or only a few confirmed cases of infection).

4

Polynomial Growth Regime (PG)

After EG we observe a systematic transition to polynomial growth (PG) in data during early epidemic stages. We support our claim here by Fig. 1 that shows the number of active cases in selected
countries during the pandemic outbreak (the data source [27], reported data from May 5, 2020).
The figure displays particular illustrative cases, see Section 7 for a systematic survey of all observed countries. For each country displayed we show the time series of active cases both on the
semilogarithmic and on the double logarithmic scales. On the semilogarithmic plot we detect a
divergence from the initial exponential trend while on the double log plot a polynomial growth
(represented as a linear trend) is emerging after the initial EG.

4.1

Polynomial growth literature

Polynomial growth in epidemic data and its eventual sources were previously discussed in literature,
including a COVID-19 context. Ziff & Ziff [18] observed PG in total number of deaths in China.
Similarly, Li & Deng [19] study COVID-19 data in mainland China and observe an evidence of PG
in the form N (t) = Atp with exponents p = 2.48, p = 2.21, and p = 4.26 in the total number
of confirmed positive cases, confirmed deaths, and recovered cases, respectively. Szabó [15] in a
theoretical work explains the PG in the total number of infected by the topology changes in the
contact networks that has a major impact on the final extent of the pandemic, see also [28] for a
survey of impact of network topology changes on COVID-19 pandemic parameters. Szabó shows
that the Barabási-Albert preferential attachment contact network with two connections of each new
node and a simplified SIR dynamics implies total extent of the pandemic at only 4% of the total
population. That is a significant reduction from the levels expected from the SIR model (60-70%)
for the studied values 2.2 < R0 < 2.6. The explanation of the lower value of an effective R0 is
that the most connected nodes are infected early in the epidemic and thus they effectively reduce
the network connectivity. Manechein et al. [29] observed a polynomial growth of COVID-19 in
all studied countries and identified a high degree of correlation between countries. Also, Maier &
Brockmann [16] propose a modification of a SIR model that produces sub-exponential growth of
infected individuals. Due to the so-called containment strategies they introduce in their model loss
terms for the number of susceptible and infected individuals that effectively force an exponential
decay that should mimic (self-)isolation. Komarova & Wodarz [30] also observe both EG and PG in
COVID-19 data and show that a pandemic progress in various countries is similar to Italy and can be
mapped onto a universal timescale by accounting for the country-specific time delay. They suggest
the PG is due to spatially structured population where the mixing between individuals is reduced.
The metapopulation is modeled as a grid of patches with free mixing within each patch and contact
with neighboring patches. No long-distance transmission is allowed in the model. Brandenburg
[17] analyzed COVID-19 data from China and observed that the number of fatalities and infections
closely followed a quadratic law. The author provided an intuitive argument based on a localspread model through a periphery of the infected area that a quadratic rate of spread appears when
local transmission in a regular 2D-lattice is the only mean of transmission. The polynomial spread
by a fractal network of social interactions was also shown in [31] with the estimated polynomial
.
exponent p = 3.75. See also [32, 33, 34] for surveys of demonstrating PG in COVID-19 pandemic
data, growth rates estimates for individual countries, and suggested explanations of the PG regime.

4.2

PG regime in SIR models

The basic SIR model is not consistent with a systematic approximate polynomial growth in the
infected population. Otherwise, if I(t) ≈ Atp , p > 0, on a interval t ∈ [t1 , t2 ], then dI/dt ≈
(p/t)I. Consequently from 2
S(t) ≈

(5)

However, the approximation 5 on the interval t ∈ [t1 , t2 ] of a significant length is inconsistent with
the assumption p > 0. Note that modifications and extensions of SIR model can eventually agree
with the observed polynomial growth phase in the infected population, however, we do not explore
this question here.

Polynomial growth with exponential decay regime (PGED)

During late epidemic stages in individual countries we systematically observe a transition to a universal scaling form (ansatz) for the number of active cases in all considered countries. In this phase
the epidemic wave reaches its peak after which the number of active cases decays. The scaling has
the form
 α


A

t
I(t) =

(6)

TG
Here A, TG and α are the model parameters. The scaling 6 is a combination of a polynomial growth
factor (t/TG )α with an exponential decay exp(−t/TG ). Therefore we refer to 6 as polynomial
growth with exponential decay (PGED). It was derived for the size of the infected population by
Vazquez [14] who used a branching process to describe the epidemic dynamics in a population
interacting on a scale-free contact network. Ziff & Ziff [18] use the PGED scaling on reported
COVID-19 data and claim that public measures and social distancing enforced yield a fractal type
contact network on which the epidemic transmission is strongly limited by the network topology.
We note that the polynomial growth models in the literature discussed in Section 4.1 can be also
adopted to account for the exponential decay factor as well by an inclusion of a constant rate of loss
from the infected population (similarly as in [16]).
We use 6 to match the observed pandemic data, particularly the number of active infection
cases as reported in [27]. Note again that no prefactors are used here so the model only describes
the dynamics of the reported data. The function I = I(t) in 6 has a maximum at t = TM = αTG
where it reaches the value P = A(α/e)−α TG−1 . Note that the inflection points of the function
√
I = I(t) are located at TI± = (α ± α) TG , particularly the time t = TI− plays an important role
in the observed epidemic data as it corresponds to a moment at which the growth of the number of
active cases reaches its maximum and starts to decrease. In the SIR model the ratio of the infected
population at the inflection point (during the 
growth
phase) and at the point of maximum is equal
√ α √
α− α
to 1/2. However, in 6 this ratio is given by
e α . This expression is equal to 1/2 for
α
.
α = 6.23. For many countries we observe α < 6.23 and thus the slowdown of the epidemiological
curve (inflection point) occurs at (often at a significantly) smaller fraction of the population than
predicted by the SIR model.
An interpretation of the parameters A, α and TG is not completely straightforward and thus
we reparametrize the model by a parameter combinations that correspond to naturally observed
quantities. The equation 6 rewritten using the parameters P, TM and α has the form

Data fitting — Methods

The model parameters in 7 were inferred by nonlinear least squares optimization in MATLAB c ,
see Tables 12 for the values obtained for individual countries. Polynomial and exponential decay
factors in 6 motivate to use logarithmically rescaled data (log I(t) or both log I(t) and log t) in
optimization. However, we use non-rescaled values instead as the PGED trend is present only
in later phases of the epidemic, particularly after the implementation of mitigation measures and
social distancing (with a delay for its manifestation in the reported data). Using non-rescaled data
allows us to globally fit the whole data set as the early epidemic data has only a small weight in the
optimization due to its relative magnitude unlike in the case of the rescaled data. The fit thus does
not require any prior (or fitting) for the time of transition to PGED.2
2

We survey all countries systematically except for Mauritius where we have discarded early epidemic data before
fitting the parameters of the model. These non-rescaled data points skew the fitted distribution significantly due to an
unusually large weight. After the discard of the data, the fit of the recent data for Mauritius is cmparable with other
countries. The nonstandard trend in data may be a consequence of extremely strict measures applied very early in
Mauritius. We also have set the origin of the data for Singapore to later dates as the current data show already a second
wave of pandemic.

7
In general, fitting polynomial growth to data is very sensitive to a choice of the origin of the fitted
time series. Therefore we have set the data starting point in all considered countries systematically.
To eliminate the effect of stochasticity in small data we have disregarded all the data points in
time series before the infected population in country reached a set threshold N0 . For Italy we set
the threshold to 200 while for all other countries the threshold was normalized — proportionally
increased or decreased in agreement with the ratio of population size of the studied country to
population of Italy (with minimum threshold set to 10 for countries with a small population).
To eliminate obvious irregularities in daily reporting we smooth the studied data. The irregularities appear naturally as the testing procedures and protocols impose systematic nonuniformity:
populations in large clusters are discovered simultaneously, there is a systematic delay in contacttracing testing, limited testing capacity, batch testing, etc. We use linear smoothing on the increments and decrements of the number of active cases via moving averages through seven days
(weights: (1, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3, 1)/27) that corresponds to three iterations of local averaging of three consecutive days. 3

5.2

PGED regime in SIR Models

Polynomial growth is not consistent with the SIR model for an extented period. However, we
consider very instructive and useful to reconcile the SIR models with the PGED regime as such a
reconciliation would allow to build PGED directly into the SIR type models. Therefore we study
whether the form (equivalent to 7)
(8)
I(t) ≈ Btα e−t/TG
can solve a SIR type model. Equation 8 implies

We can now compare 9 with 2 and identify

and

Thus, the exponential decay e−t/TG term in 8 can be seen as a consequence of the infected removal
rate γ = 1/TG in the SIR model. Furthermore, the term βS/N corresponds to α/t. Finally, we
express this dependence in terms of the relative reproduction number R0 :
R0 (t) =

β S
TM

γ N
t

where TM = αTG = α/γ is a constant, see Section 5 for its interpretation as the time of the
epidemic peak. Therefore PGED implies an algebraic decay of R0 in the SIR model.
Note that this result is in agreement with the argument about the reduction of infection transmissibility in [21] and also with the R0 analysis in study [35] of the impact of non-pharmaceutical
interventions in European countries. There the change of the reproduction number R0 is modeled
as an average percentage reduction per specific type of intervention and the analysis is based on
a Bayesian approach using data on number of infected and number of deaths, which are more reliable. Also note that as t → 0+ the relative reproduction number diverges to ∞. This is in an
agreement with the model of [15] where the fat-tail power-law distribution of R0 in the population
has initially an infinite mean that with the epidemic outbreak reduces to finite values. Average R0
further reduces during the epidemic by a gradual elimination of the individuals with a high values
of R0 from the susceptible population — the individuals with high values of R0 are easily infected
and removed from the susceptible class as the first.
3

There are significant irregularities in reporting of the number of recovered cases in some countries. United Kingdom
does not report recovered cases hence we have removed it from our analysis. Some other countries only report the
recovered cases weekly or they report them only very seldom. Thus for Finland, Greece, Ireland, and Mexico we have
used the simple equal weight moving average over 20 days for the recovered cases data. In multiple other irregularly
reporting countries such smoothing has a small effect on the active cases model parameters and thus we did not apply it.

Three Phases of Epidemics — Summary

Based on the presented analysis we expect three phases of a single epidemic wave.
• Initial Exponential Phase. During the initial phase (with no applied mitigation measures) we
expect the exponential growth of the infected population I = I(t) as discussed in Section 3:


I(t) ≈ I0 exp γ(R0 (0) − 1)t .
• Polynomial Growth Phase. After the initial phase we expect a short transient phase during
which I = I(t) smoothly transitions from the initial exponential phase to the polynomial
growth phase described in Section 4. During this phase
I(t) ≈ Ctp .
• Final Polynomial Growth with Exponential Decay Phase. After an introduction of the mitigation measures and social distancing and a subsequent delay necessary for their appearance
in the reported data we expect a transition of I = I(t) from the PG phase to PGED phase
described in Section 5. During this phase

Note that is some countries the mitigation measures were applied when the number of infected was
low or zero (Slovakia, Lithuania) and the initial exponential phase was too short to be identified in
the data. Also note that during the PG phase the function I = I(t) is convex (p > 1 for all observed
countries). For such a function to reach its local maximum it must first go through an inflection
point. Unless the inflection point appears during the transient phase between PG and PGED the
PG phase must connect to the PGED phase before the PGED phase reaches its inflection point, i.e.,
before the time t = TI− . This phenomenon was also observed in data of all surveyed countries and
it helps to improve predictions for countries that have not reached the PGED phase yet.

Data Analysis Results

We conducted a systematic survey of COVID-19 pandemic data ([27], the last reporting day May
9, 2020) for all countries where the time series are sufficiently long to display a consistent trend
(in total 118 countries). In each country (together with all its territories) we consider the number
of active cases equal to the total number of reported confirmed infections decreased by the sum of
reported total number of recovered and deaths. For a characterization of the epidemic progression
we use the following phases: the initial exponential phase (EG), the polynomial growth phase (PG),
and the polynomial growth with exponential decay phase (PGED). The final PGED phase has two
checkpoints, the inflection point (I) and the epidemic peak—the point of maximum of the active
infected population (M), after which the number of infected consistently decreases (D).

7.1

Classification of Individual Countries

Our results are presented in Tables 1–3 that summarize the stage of the epidemic in all surveyed
countries. If a country reached the PGED regime we report the estimated values of the related
PGED parameters. See Section 5.1 for the methodology and remarks on exceptions made for some
individual countries. We support our results in Fig. 1–8 that display data from selected countries.
The figures show total active cases data time series for countries that are organized by the epidemic
phase. For each country presented we show the data on both linear and semilogarithmic plot (countries in EG and PG phase) and also on double logarithmic plot (countries in PGED phase). For the
countries in the PGED regime we also show the best PGED fit to the data.4

For technical reasons the plots correspond to data [27] with the last data point on May 5, 2020. Table 4 contains the
estimated PGED parameters for the data shown in these figures.

Table 3: Classification of countries, part 3. E – exponential phase, PG – polynomial phase. Data
[27] from May 9, 2020

7.2

Countries in EG and PG phases (05-May-2020)

In Figure 1 we present two groups of countries in the early stages of the epidemic: the countries
in the EG phase (Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, India) and countries in the PG
phase (Argentina, Indonesia, Qatar, Russia, Somalia). To demonstrate an evidence of EG and PG,
respectively, we compare the recent data with a straight line in the respective plot.

7.3

Countries in the PGED phase past inflection point (05-May-2020)

Figures 2, 3 provide an graphical overview of selected countries past their inflection point in PGED
regime but still ahead of their epidemic peak (both times for the fitted PGED approximation are
indicated in the corresponding figure). For selected countries we indicate the date [35, 36] of the
most severe social mitigation measures applied in the displayed country and also a date 10 days
later after the first measure was implemented. The displayed data indicate that the transition from
the PGED regime may be closely connected with the delayed effect of the applied measures. This
observation can eventually help to make more accurate predictions for the countries that have not yet
reached the PGED regime but have already introduced mitigation measures, i.e. even for countries
that do not show any signal of a systematic decay in the data.

7.4

Countries in the PGED phase close to and past the epidemic peak (05-May-2020)

Selected countries close to and past the epidemic peak are displayed in Figure 4 and Figures 5–
6, respectively. Consistent approximate exponential decay in the number of reported active cases
in many countries may serve as a sign of a successful strategy against the further spread of the
coronavirus. However, due to factors as abatement of the strict mitigation measures, fatigue of
following social distancing, or simply due to reintroduction of the virus into the community a further
spreading may occur. Such a trend that is demonstrated by a sudden slow down of the exponential
decay (Austria, Australia, Vietnam) or even a sign of the next epidemic wave (Azerbaijan, Burkina
Faso, Chile, Djibouti, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Madagascar) also appears in the

reported data, see selected countries in Figure 7. For Singapore we only model its second epidemic
wave.

7.5

Typical time scale of removal of infected individuals

The parameter TG of PGED characterizes the typical time scale of removal of infected individuals,
particularly those who would be eventually tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by a PCR test,
i.e., the time period during which an average infected individual can infect others (in susceptible
population). A smaller value of TG correspond to a fast decay after a country reaches its epidemic
peak while large values of TG indicate very flat epidemic peaks and thus a very slow gradual decay
of the active cases. In practice, TG is influenced by multiple factors, among them ability to identify,
test and quarantine positive cases in the population and contact-tracing procedures play a prominent
role. While a larger and better selected infection testing sample can significantly decrease TG in
countries with a higher degree of epidemic, in countries with a small number of active cases finding
and testing a small number of infected in the whole population can be very difficult. Therefore
contact-tracing and a prevention of an import of infections from other countries can be the key
measures to lower the value of TG . See Fig. 10 for the graphical display of the sorted values of
TG for countries that are at or beyond the epidemic peak. Countries classified as undergoing the
second wave are not included in the plot as a presence of apparent second wave may be eventually
a sign of spurious data. Note that the countries that are currently close to their epidemic peak have
higher values of TG than countries that are already further in the decay phase (with the exception of
Jamaica). The data suggest that countries with a small values of TG (Mauritius∗ , Iceland, Ireland,
Australia, Austria, New Zealand) are very efficient in testing and isolation of the individuals who
will be tested positive thus preventing them for further spreading of the infection. On the other
hand, the data for countries with large values of TG (Slovenia, Norway, Uruguay) do not show an
indication of an efficient testing and isolation of infected (or they may not properly report recovered
cases data). However, this interpretation needs to be taken with a caution with regard to the note of
precaution in Section 1.1. Particularly, the interpretation of TG in countries marked with ∗ in Fig. 10
and Tab. 1–3 can be influenced by the special adjustment of the time series mentioned in previous
sections.

7.6

PGED model as a predictive tool

The simple PGED model, i.e., the universal scaling 7 and nonlinear fitting of the parameters from
the data, can be used for as a predictive tool for the number of the reported active cases, particularly
in countries in the growth phase. Once again keep in mind the note of precaution we formulated in
Section 1.1. No verifiable connection of the number of active cases to the total number of infected
in the population was established so far. Therefore all the predictions only concern the reported
data.
We present a performance of the predictive capabilities of the PGED model using the available
data for eight selected countries (Belgium, Belarus, Czechia, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, and
US) that are in different epidemic phases and also display a variable accuracy of predictions. Testing
was performed by comparing the values predicted by the PGED model (based on the incomplete
data in which we have removed up to 15 data points from the end of the time series) to the withheld
data. For each choice of the number of withheld days we have calculated the 95% confidence
interval for the inferred parameters by MATLAB c function nlpredci.m. Particularly, we were
interested in the confidence intervals for the location of the epidemic peak and the number of active
cases at the peak. Predictive power of the model can be visualized by plotting the bounding boxes
corresponding to the confidence interval around the inferred location of the epidemic peak. A good
model should provide a consistent position of the confidence intervals with smaller boxes indicating
a large degree of certainty in the predictions. Note that the analysis using the bounding boxes can
be considered also a study of a sensitivity of the fit to the data.

14
The countries in Fig. 8 are among those past the inflection point, at the epidemic peak or past
the peak. In the latter case we withheld sufficiently many data points so that the estimates would
be nontrivial. Overall, we have found that the short-term prediction (up to 1-2 weeks prior to the
peak) tends to predict the location and value of the peak relatively well (Belgium, Portugal, Israel,
Switzerland), however, the confidence intervals may be quite large in case not enough data beyond
the inflection point is available (Belarus). When the inflection point (and the PGED regime) has
not been reached yet, the information about an eventual exponential decay is not directly detectable
in the data and the location and the value at the peak thus cannot be estimated, see the remark at
the end of Section 6 for a discussion of a possible prediction improvement for countries in the PG
phase, i.e., before they reach the PGED regime. We also illustrate two common situations: while
for US, Italy and Portugal the prediction with less information underestimates the severity of the
infection, for Czechia a forecast overestimates with less data. However, in both cases the fits were
changing monotonically with the number of data points included in the analysis. Note that some of
these trends may be due to variation in testing procedures and protocols.
In Fig. 11 we also show how 95% confidence intervals can be calculated for the whole future
data trajectory. This is not straightforward as the 95% confidence intervals for the estimated parameters are not independent. However, using the covariance structure of the inferred parameters
it is possible to sample the parameters from the multivariate normal distribution and display the
confidence intervals systematically for all times, as shown in the figure.

7.7

Application of the PGED model for data predictions

The presented model can be also visualized using the web based tool [37]. It allows a general public
to explore the data for various countries, including validation of the model predictions. Using the
PGED model we have also successfully constructed a prediction on March 30, 2020, for the reported
COVID-19 data in Slovakia that estimated a epidemic peak of about 1000 active cases in early May
and that very closely matched the observed data, see the reference in the national media [38]. At that
point in time the prediction differed by orders of magnitude from the predictions of compartment
based models. Subsequently, the PGED model was incorporated into the main epidemic (SIR type)
model in Slovakia maintained by the analytic unit of the Ministry of Health and that serves as a
reference tool for the government crisis management team decision making during the COVID-19
outbreak in Slovakia [39].

7.8

Analysis of next epidemic wave

The state of exponential decay of the infected population is often viewed by policy makers as the
ultimate goal. However, without reaching the state of herd immunity the epidemiological situation
is unstable with respect to secondary infections caused by rare infected individuals, new imported
cases, and related superspreading events. We illustrate such a situation in the numerical example
in Figure 9. As an example we consider the reported data in Austria (over the period March 1 –
April 15). For simplicity we match the data using the EG regime first (using the SIR model with
inferred parameters β and γ). The simulation is initialized on March 1 (14 infected, 0 recovered,
total population approx. 8.9 mil.). SIR dynamics is applied for the first 16 days reflecting the lack
of measures in the early stages of the infection spread (note that the measures reflect in the reported
data with a delay). After 16 days we match the rest of the data with PGED model (with inferred
parameters P , α and TM and a continuous R0 ; the values are similar to the parameters for Austria
reported in Table 1). We then continue PGED model until the May 31 (90 days after the considered
initial date). The number of recovered during PGED regime period is calculated from the 3 and
the number of susceptible as the complement of infected and recovered in the population. The
remaining population of infected individuals is estimated to be 20 on May 31.
In the studied scenario we lift the mitigation measures completely on May 31. The dynamics
then returns back to the standard SIR model and undergoes an EG phase. We study the impact of an
early detection of the emerging situation (upcoming second wave) and consequent implementation

15
of mitigation measures. We considered three alternatives: mitigation measures fully implemented
after 1, 2, and 3 weeks (see shaded regions in Fig. 9). We observe that an early implementation
of the mitigation measures dramatically reduces the next epidemic peak. A qualitatively similar
progress can be seen in case of imported infections (we add 30 new infected cases at the time of
released mitigation measures). The numerical results indicate how essential is to implement mitigation measures as early as possible, which requires efficient tools for an early detection of infected
individuals. This example shows how the very simple PGED model can be used for analytics of the
COVID-19 pandemic in individual countries.

Discussion and Perspectives

Reported data on COVID-19 display systematically identifiable regimes – exponential growth, polynomial growth, and polynomial growth with exponential decay. The observed universal scaling is a
bit surprising as the pandemic mitigation and social distancing measures, the testing procedures and
protocols, and many other aspects, vary significantly from one country to another. Nevertheless, the
scaling appears to be a strong attractor of the reported active cases dynamics globally. An important feature of PG and PGED regime is that they both contribute to a slowdown of the epidemic
growth in the reported data compared to expected dynamics driven by the SIR model. Note that
we have only considered the active cases data but our preliminary data analysis confirms that the
PG trends are present in the reported deaths and where available also in reported hospitalizations.
Therefore we conjecture that the observed transition between the different regimes is comparable to
phase transitions in physics, thus one expects that the universal scalings in data are a consequence
of some unidentified fundamental properties related to the pandemic. Lack of the reliable and detailed data that would allow to discriminate between their eventual sources and a high complexity of
the studied system that involves the virus/disease (its medical, chemical, and physical properties),
behavior of individuals in population, and enforcement of the mitigation measures (see [2] for a
summary of some related questions) do not allow to identify underlying factors for the observed PG
and PGED regimes. Here we only list eventual candidates (or their combinations):
• Significant changes in the effective contact network (social distancing and other mitigation
measures) including low infection transmission probability in majority of contacts due to
imposed safety measures (personal protection items as face masks, gloves, disinfectants, etc.).
• Limitations of testing procedures and selection of the sample used for testing, including high
level of uncertainty in test sensitivity (related to limit of detection and difficulties with sample
collection) and specificity of all types of tests, over- and undersampling of various groups in
testing, and failure to identify and test asymptomatic carriers; delays in test reporting.
• Limited understanding of details of infection spread mechanisms, particularly the role of
individual and temporal variation of viral load in infected individuals and their ability of
infect others, related to various clinical stages of the disease; a lack of understanding of
mechanisms of superspreading events.
Note that the observed PG a PGED regimes are not in agreement with the traditional SIR type
models that typically form a base for pandemic spread predictions published in the media unless
their parameters are modified from their expected values, particularly a total population is decreased
to a significantly lower effective total population. Therefore we conclude that although this work
does not provide understanding of the full extent of the pandemic as it only models the reported data,
it still may provide a useful source for decision making, for a comparison of different countries, or
for economical predictions by governments, epidemiologists, and economists.

Figure 2: Selected countries beyond their inflection point of PGED regime (part I). The countryspecific locations of the PGED inflection point (blue) and the epidemic peak (red) are marked by
vertical lines. For model parameters see Table 2. Dates of applicaton of mitigation measures are
indicated for some countries (data [35, 36]) by the gray pointers. The magenta pointers indicate
the time 10 days after the application of the first measure. The best PGED model fit is plotted
in green. Linear (left), semilogarithmic (center), and double log plot (right) are shown for each
country. Straight lines indicate EG and PG in semi log and double log plots, respectively. The data
is shown from the epidemic onset until May 5, 2020 [27].

Figure 8: Predictions based on PGED model. For each country we remove the last n data points
or last n data points before the epidemic peak (if already reached), 0 ≤ n ≤ D (see plot labels
for the values of D) while always keeping the data points in black. PGED model parameters are
inferred for each n. 95% confidence intervals for two PGED parameters (time and population of
the epidemic peak) inferred by nonlinear regression are shown as bounding boxes around the mean
in red. The presented data display: small uncertainty, small overlapping confidence intervals (A),
large uncertainty, not enough data (B), monotonicity, additional data shifts the peak earlier (C), well
predicted location of the peak and the data past (D), monotonicity, additional data shifts peak later
(E, F, G), well predicted location of the peak but data past the peak not well captured (H).The data
is shown from the epidemic onset to May 9, 2020 [27].

Figure 9: Influence of an early intervention on an extent of the next epidemic wave. Data from
Austria ([27] from April 15, 2020) are fitted by a combination of EG (SIR model) and PGED
regime (March 1 – April 15) with a set transition on March 16. Scenario I (solid lines): 90 days
after the epidemic onset mitigation policies are completely lifted while there are still 20 infected
individuals in the population. At that point the SIR dynamics restarts. The mitigation policies are
reintroduced after 7, 14, and 21 days. Secenario II: In addition 30 more infected individuals are
introduced 90 days after the epidemic onset (dashed lines). Shaded regions indicate the times of
duration of the EG regime.

Figure 10: The inferred values of the parameter TG of PGED regime for countries close or beyond their epidemic peak (except those observing an apparent second epidemic wave). Lower TG
corresponds to efficient identification, testing and isolation/removal of infected. Stars indicate modification of the data to account for data reporting irregularities, see the text.

Figure 11: Confidence regions for the all future times for selected countries. The data (black) are
used for inference of the PGED parameters P , α and TM and their covariance matrix. The best fit is
displayed (solid green line). Symmetric 95% confidence intervals obtained by sampling parameters
from the mutivariate normal distribution with the same covariance structure are displayed as shaded
regions.
