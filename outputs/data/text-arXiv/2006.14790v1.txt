ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus
that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness responsible for the
COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for
COVID-19 and so, there is an urgent need for expedite discovery of new therapeutics to
combat the disease until a vaccine will be available worldwide.
Drug repurposing is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved drugs that has the
advantage (over conventional approaches that attempt to develop a drug from scratch) that
time frame of the overall process can be significantly reduced because of the few number of
clinical trial required.
In this work, a virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs was performed for repositioning as
potential inhibitors of the main protease M​pro​ of SARS-CoV-2. As a result of this study, 12
drugs are proposed as candidates for inhibitors of the M​pro​ enzyme. Some of the selected
compounds are antiviral drugs that are already being tested in COVID-19 clinical trials (i.e.
ribavirin) or are used to alleviate symptoms of the disease (i.e. codeine). Surprisingly, the
most promising candidate is the naturally occurring broad spectrum antibiotic
oxytetracycline. This compound has largely outperformed the remaining selected candidates
along all filtering steps of our virtual screening protocol.
If the activity of any of these drugs is experimentally corroborated, they could be used
directly in clinical trials without the need for pre-clinical testing or safety evaluation since they
are already used as drugs for other diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain.​[1]​ It has named so because its
RNA genome is about 82% identical to that of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).​[2]
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and a pandemy on
11 March 2020.​[3]​ As of 15th May 2020 SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than four million of
infections all around the globe and more than three hundred thousand deaths.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.​[4]​ Therefore, there
is an urgent need, today more than ever before, for expedite discovery of novel therapeutics.
Since the process of bringing a new pharmaceutical drug to the market, once a lead
compound has been identified, usually takes from 10-15 years, a workaround to shorten the
drug discovery cycle is required in the current scenario.
Drug repurposing or repositioning is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved drugs
that are outside the scope of the original medical indication.​[5]​ This strategy offers various

advantages over developing an entirely new drug for a given indication. The most relevant
one in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemy is the time frame for drug development
that can be significantly reduced because most of the preclinical testing, safety assessment
and formulation development already have been completed.
Moreover, since the onset of COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan in December 2019, a lot of
scientific resources related to SARS-CoV-2 have been released in expedited time, from the
virus genome sequence​[2]​ to protein structures solved by X-Ray crystallography to
supramolecular structures mapped at atomic scale by CryoEM,​[6, 7]​ which makes it possible
to apply a Structure-based drug approach for drug discovery.
In the Protein Data Bank there are currently deposited both structural proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 like the spike glycoprotein (S) and also non-structural proteins (NSPs) like the
main protease (M​pro​), papain-like protease (PL​pro​), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)
among other NSPs.
The S glycoprotein on the virion surface mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion
to gain entry into host cells. Biophysical and structural evidence reveal that both SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2 share the same functional host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) but the novel strain binds to it with 10 to 20-fold higher affinity than the
former which may contribute to the apparent ease with which SARS-CoV-2 can spread.​[7]
Because of its indispensable function, it represents a target for antibody-mediated
neutralization. However, for small molecule drug design, protein-protein interaction (PPI)
surfaces like that in S-ACE2 complex is very difficult to target because of its large size and
flatness. Compared to the active site of an enzyme, PPIs are stabilized through large
interfaces and it has been considered a difficult task to find small molecules competing with
the binding of a protein partner. [8]
​
Regarding NSPs, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an enzyme required for
SARS-CoV-2 replication and it was shown that can be inhibited by remdesivir, a broad
spectrum antiviral drug that has been originally developed to treat Ebola virus disease.​[9]​ On
29 April 2020, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced
that remdesivir was better than a placebo in reducing time to recovery for people
hospitalized with advanced COVID-19 and lung involvement.​[10]​ Although remdesivir has now
been authorized for emergency use in the U.S., it is far from being the “silver bullet” to cure
COVID-19.
Moreover, viral proteases are often druggable targets, HIV protease inhibitors are perhaps
the most successful story about viral protease inhibitors development. Similarly to HIV
protease, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M​pro​) is essential for processing the polyproteins that
are translated from the viral RNA. Therefore, inhibiting the activity of this enzyme would
eventually stop viral replication.​[11]
One of the treatments options currently under study as part of the solidarity trial launched by
the WHO​[12]​ involves two HIV protease inhibitors, Lopinavir and Ritonavir. Regrettably,
preliminary results conducted in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19 has not shown
benefit from this treatment.​[13]
In this work we performed a Virtual Screening (VS) study for drug repurposing of FDA
approved drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ inhibitors.
M​pro ​is a dimer of two identical subunits (Figure 1), with each protomer composed of three
domains. Two antiparallel β-barrel structures conform domains I and II and a third globular

α-helical domain III is connected to domain II by means of a long loop region.​[14]​ The
substrate binding cleft is located between domains I and II.
The fold of the first two domains resemble architecture of serine proteases like
chymotrypsin, but a cysteine amino acid and a nearby histidine (catalytic dyad) perform the
protein-cutting reaction. The third α-helical domain is involved in regulating the dimerization
of M​pro​.​[11]

Figure 1​. Structure M​pro​ (monomer A) in complex with potent α-ketoamide inhibitor 13b from reference
11 (PDB code 6Y2G).

Hilgenfeld and colleagues have recently designed and synthesized peptidomimetic
α-ketoamides to be used as inhibitors of the main proteases of coronaviruses. They
obtained a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​.​[11]​ In another study, Jin and colleagues
identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and
subsequently determined the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ in complex with this
compound.​[14]​ Solved structures of the enzyme in complex with these two potent
peptidomimetic inhibitors (PDB accession codes 6Y2G and 6LU7, respectively) provides
structural basis for design of novel drug-like inhibitors. Moreover, another recent
crystallographic fragment screening against SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ that has been deposited in
the Protein Data Bank (DOI: ​10.2210/pdb5rgj/pdb​) also might help to find structural
determinants for ligand anchoring within the enzyme binding cleft. In this work we exploited
the available structural information about ligand binding to M​pro​ binding cleft to guide the drug
repurposing Virtual Screening experiment.
COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
Figure 2 shows the overall workflow for selection of candidate compounds.

Figure 2​. Workflow of the Virtual Screening procedure for candidate compound selection.
FDA-approved drugs collection compiled as 3D SDF files was downloaded from BindingDB
database (​www.bindingdb.org​). LigPrep by Schrodinger was used to generate the different
protomers and tautomers while retaining specified chiralities.​[15]​ After generating the different
chemical possibilities, the drug repurposing library ended up with ~ 3000 compounds.
Solved structure of unliganded form of SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ was employed as receptor for rigid
docking (accession code: 6YB7). Up to date, more than 100 structures of SARS-CoV-2 M​pro
with ligands bound at the enzyme binding cleft, have been released. These ligand-bound
structures of the enzyme were exploited in this work to find key interaction sites or “hot
spots” within the binding cleft. These “hot spots” were then incorporated as pharmacophoric
restraints (ph4s) to guide docking solutions.
Docking of drug repurposing library was performed with rDock program.​[16]​ The cavity was
prepared with the reference ligand method, using coordinates of inhibitor N3 covalently
bound to SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​(accession code 6LU7). N3 is a large peptidomimetic inhibitor
that target all the binding cleft sub-pockets. Structure of 6LU7 was aligned to 6YB7 before
performing the cavity mapping.
For each docked ligand, poses were sorted by total SCORE from standard rDock scoring
function (SF) and only the top ranked pose was kept. Then, ligands best poses were sorted
based in SF terms that account for intermolecular interactions (SCORE.INTER) and
satisfaction of pharmacophoric restraints (SCORE.RESTR), whenever applicable. Top 200

ranked drugs (i.e. those that achieve the stronger interactions and satisfy the imposed
restraints) were selected for DUck simulations (Figure 2).
DUck is a fast protocol for Steered Molecular Dynamic (SMD) simulations that has been
thought for using in drug discovery projects. DUck calculates the work necessary to reach a
quasi-bound state at which the ligand has just broken the most important native contact with
the receptor (W​QB​). Since true ligands form more resilient interactions than decoys, this
non-equilibrium property has shown to be surprisingly effective in virtual screening
contexts.​[17]
To drive the DUck simulations we choose one of the “hot spots” identified in the previous
PDB survey of available SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ complexes, i.e. the sames that were also
considered for defining the ph4 restraints to guide docking calculations (see results section).
Those ligands requiring a W​QB​ > 4 kcal/mol to break the reference hydrogen bond with the
enzyme were further scrutinized by MD simulations and binding free energy calculations.
While DUck evaluates structural stability, binding free energy estimations provide information
about thermodynamic stability of the complexes. Therefore, they are orthogonal to each
other and can offer complementary information about complex stability. Accordingly,
complexes that surpassed DUck filter were subjected to 20 nanoseconds of MD simulations
in triplicate with Amber 16 software package (All-atoms force field ff14SB).​[18]​ Those MD
trajectory replicas from which ligand did not detached from enzyme binding cleft were
sampled at regular intervals to get an averaged estimate of the relative binding free energy
(​ΔΔG​) of complexes by applying the MM-GBSA protocol. The details of this method have
been presented elsewhere.​[19]​ The conformational entropy change −TΔS is usually computed
by normal mode analysis, but in this study the entropy contributions were not calculated. In
practice entropy contributions can be neglected when comparing states with similar entropy
such as two ligands binding to the same protein, provided that only the relative free energy is
informed.
Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM)
QTAIM analysis consists in the mapping of the gradient vector field ∇ on top of the charge
density (ρ) of the system thus giving rise to the topological elements of the charge density,
two of which are unequivocal indicators of a bonding interaction: the Bond Critical Point
(BCP) and the Bond Paths (BPs) that connect BCP to the bonded atoms.​[20]​ Unlike the
geometrical parameters (i.e. bond distance and angle and also types of atoms involved) for
describing non covalent interactions, QTAIM does not rely on any arbitrary criteria for
deciding whether an interaction is actually formed or not: the sole presence of a BCP and
the corresponding BPs between two atoms guarantee the existence of the interaction.
The electronic charge density for complexes of SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ with selected candidate
compounds was computed with Gaussian 16 software package.​[21]​ The topological analysis
of the charge density was then carried out with the help of Multiwfn​[22] ​and ​in house​ python
scripts. To sample a proper structure from the MD simulations for QTAIM analysis, trajectory
frames were aligned by protein backbone atoms and then clusterized by similarity based on
their Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSD). A representative structure from the most
populated cluster was selected for QTAIM calculations. Since quantum mechanical
calculations are still forbidden for full biomolecular complexes, reduced model systems were
constructed from the selected representative structures by considering residues up to a
distance range of 5 Å from ligand atoms.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 3 shows fragments from a recent reported crystallographic fragment screening on
SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ (​10.2210/pdb5rgj/pdb​).

Figure 3​. Fragments from a crystallographic fragment screening as they bound to M​pro​ binding cleft.
As observed in figure inset at the bottom right corner, the binding cleft is composed of several
sub-pockets. At the S1 sub-pocket, we noted two conserved hydrogen bond (H-bond) sites among
fragments that involves Gly 143 – Ser 144 backbone and His 163 imidazole. Pharmacophoric
restraints (cyan spheres) at these interaction sites were considered to guide docking solutions in VS
campaigns.

While different fragments bind to different regions of SARS-CoV-2 M​pro ​binding cleft, there
are two interaction sites at the enzyme S1 sub-pocket that are targeted by most fragments.
They involve His 163 imidazole (site 1) and backbone of Gly 143 and Ser 144 residues from
a loop structure that hold the catalytic Cys 145 (site 2). In both cases fragments are acting
as H-bond acceptors against corresponding interaction site.

Interaction site 2 is specialized to hold an H-bond acceptor, since main-chain amides of Gly
143, Ser 144 and Cys 145 form the canonical “oxyanion hole” of the cysteine protease that
stabilize the transition state negative charge on the amide carbonyl oxygen of the substrate
after nucleophilic attack by Cys 145.​[11]
Regarding interaction site 1, a closer look at His 163 neighborhood reveals that its
interaction partner in most of the structures is not really one of the fragments from the
crystallographic screen but it is actually a co-solvent molecule of DMSO. The fact that a
DMSO molecule is almost constantly anchored at this site might indicate either that
fragments do not have preference for it or that they are not able to displace the DMSO
molecule. Solved structures of SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ in complex with peptidomimetic inhibitors
(PDBs 6Y2G and 6LU7) show that inhibitor P1 𝛾-lactam moiety, designed as a glutamine
surrogate, is deeply embedded in the S1 pocket of the protease where the lactam oxygen
accept an H-bond from the imidazole of His 163.​[11]​ Therefore, it is likely that His 163
interaction site is also important for ligand anchoring at the S1 sub-pocket.
As these interaction sites or “hot spots” seem to be important for ligand binding we have
taken them into account in the virtual screenings in the way of pharmacophoric restraints, a
functionality of the docking algorithm that is useful to incorporate knowledge-based features
to guide docking solutions.
We first ran a virtual screening (VS) round without imposing pharmacophoric restraints and
noted that most drugs tend to lay over the catalytic loop at the S1 sub-pocket forming
H-bonds with backbone of Gly 143 and/or Ser144. Therefore, a restraint to force formation of
these interactions might not be necessary in most cases. Nevertheless, to ensure anchoring
on the catalytic loop, an H-bond acceptor restraint was set close to Gly 143 backbone (site).
A gentle tolerance radius of 1.0 Å was asigned so that the ligand acceptor atom can satisfy
the restraint by H-bonding to either Gly 143 N-H bond or any of the nearby equivalent bonds
from the catalytic loop backbone (i.e. from Ser 144 or even Cys 145).
On the other hand, H-bond interaction with His 163 imidazole (site 1) was less frequently
observed among docking poses and so, a restraint at this interaction site is mandatory to
force H-bond formation. Accordingly, a second round of VS was run with pharmacophoric
restraints at both interaction sites.
Top ranked compounds from both VS rounds were further scrutinized with methodology that
allow a more accurate characterization of the binding event. Compounds that surpassed
docking filters (see computational details section) were first subjected to DUck calculations.
For compounds selected from the first unrestrained VS run, interaction site 2 was chosen to
drive DUck calculations since H-bond to site 1 was rarely observed without imposing
restraints, as discussed above. Whereas for compounds filtered from the second restrained
VS round, both interaction sites were considered for W​QB​ calculation and the highest value is
informed (see Table 1 notes).
Standard MD simulations were then carried out in triplicate for compounds that performed
well in DUck calculations in order to get an estimate of their relative binding energies (ΔΔG)
to M​pro​ protease. For comparison purposes, binding energy was also computed for potent
alpha-ketoamide inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ previously co-crystallized with the enzyme
(accession code 6Y2G).
Table 1 reports candidate compounds selected from both VS rounds according to the
protocol described in Figure 2. And figure 4 shows best docking poses of selected inhibitors
from Table 1.

Figure 4​. Docking poses for selected compounds from Table 1. COD = codeine, TIC = ticagrelor,
OTC = oxytetracycline, RIBA = ribavirin, ECF = pentostatin, ELV = elvitegravir.

Compounds in Figure 3 can be considered as a representative sample of common scaffolds
found among top ranked compounds from both VS rounds.
COD, ELV and OTC, despite having different overall structure they share a common
pharmacophoric feature consisting in two acceptor oxygen atoms in a planar structure at
3-bonds distance to each other (i.e. in 1, 4 position). This acceptors disposition allows
formation of several N–H···O interactions with H-bond donors from the catalytic loop
backbone, at the S1 sub-pocket. At least one of the acceptor atoms is involved in a ring
structure which is oriented nearly perpendicularly to the catalytic loop and flanked at both
sides by side chain of Cys 145 and Asn 142.
On the other hand, nitrogen-rich heterocyclic rings from RIBA, TIC and ECF also tend to
interact with the oxyanion hole donors but they are oriented parallel to the catalytic loop
backbone forming N–H···𝝅 interactions.
In addition to binding at the catalytic loop, additional anchoring to S1 sub-pocket is provided
by interactions with side chain of His 163, Ser 144 and Glu 166 and backbone of Phe 140.
Anchoring at this deepest region of S1 sub-pocket seems to be better achieved by
compounds having a 5-membered sugar-like ring placed at this region (i.e. as in RIBA, ECF
and TIC) that is able to form an extensive H-bond network through its OH groups.
Moreover, TIC, ECF and EVG also target S1’ sub-pocket, the first two compounds form a
strong N–H···O interaction with backbone carbonyl oxygen of residue Thr 26 from such
sub-pocket.
Most compounds do not extend beyond S1 and S1’ sub-pockets except OTC that also target
S2 and S3 sub-pockets from enzyme binding cleft by forming two strong interactions with
backbone of Glu 166, among other interactions (discussed below). COD and TIC partially
extend into S2 sub-pocket by accepting a proton from backbone amide of Glu 166.
Regarding the known uses of these drugs, COD is already being used for clinical
management of COVID-19 patients to suppress coughing when it is distressing. It could be
the case that a therapeutic effect of COD (i.e. due to M​pro​ inhibition) might be also operating
under the hood in conjunction with its cough alleviating effect, to improve overall patient
condition.
RIBA and ELV are antiviral medications whose known action mechanisms do not involve the
viral protease. ECF similarly than RIBA is a purine analog that interfere with DNA synthesis
and is used as anticancer treatment. TIC acts as a platelet aggregation inhibitor used for the
prevention of stroke, heart attack and other events in people with acute coronary syndrome.
Whereas OTC is a naturally occurring broad spectrum antibiotic produced as secondary
metabolite by ​Streptomyces​ strains. Chlortetracycline and Doxycycline in Table 1 also
belong to the same group of antibiotics.
As indicated by data in Table 1, OTC is the most promising candidate for repositioning as
SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ inhibitor. As indicated by the W​QB​ value, a work of at least ~11 kcal/mol is
required to break main interactions with the oxyanion hole residues and to pull it out from the
enzyme binding cleft. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, its W​QB​ profile as a function of H-bond
distance resemble that of a strong ligand, i.e. with similar outcomes among all DUck
replicas.

Figure 5​. W​QB​ profile for OTC.

OTC also preserves its original docking pose within M​pro​ binding cleft along the entire
simulation time in three out of three MD replicas (pose stability in Table 1). Stability of OTC
binding is also reflected in the complex relative binding free energies (ΔΔG) which has been
computed with respect to potent alpha-ketoamide inhibitor. For instance, binding of OTC to
M​pro​ is about 18 kcal/mol more stable than for COD and about 27 kcal/mol than for RIBA
(see Table 1). Furthermore, binding of potent alpha-ketoamide inhibitor to M​pro​ is just ~12
kcal/mol more stable than for OTC which is an encouraging result considering the larger size
of the first one which is a large peptidomimetic inhibitor that target all sub-pocket of M​pro
binding cleft and it has been specifically designed to bind SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​.​[11]
A more detailed analysis of OTC binding to M​pro
For a more ​in deep​ analysis of the molecular interactions of OTC at the M​pro​ binding cleft we
next performed a topological analysis of the charge density (QTAIM) on a representative
structure from MD simulations.
Figure 6 shows binding mode of OTC at the SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ binding cleft. Topological
elements of the charge density describing OTC interactions are depicted.

Figure 6​. Binding mode of OTC at the SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ binding cleft. Topological elements of the
charge density are depicted: small red circles are the Bond Critical Points (BCPs) and yellow lines
connecting them to neighboring nuclei are the Bond Paths (BPs). In A only topological elements for
the most relevant intermolecular interactions are depicted. While in B all the interactions involving
OTC are shown to emphasize its extensive anchoring that encompass several binding cleft
sub-pockets.

Perhaps the most salient characteristic of OTC as potential SARS-CoV-2 M​pro​ inhibitor is its
overall molecular shape which complements very well the enzyme binding cleft. M​pro​ binding
cleft is a J-shaped cavity where the S1 and S1’ sub-pockets are perpendicularly oriented to
S2 and S3 sub-pockets. Thanks to OTC curved shape and size, it can lay over S1
sub-pocket surface forming an intricate network of interactions with oxyanion hole residues
Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145 (Figure 6A) and at the same time it can also bind to
the S2 and S3 sub-pockets which provide additional anchoring points.
While the overall docking pose is preserved after MD simulations, there have been some
changes in the interaction pattern that it is worth noting (compare with Figures 3). For
instance, Glu 166 side chain which was too far as to directly interact with OTC in the docking
pose, formed a strong H-bond with an OTC hydroxyl group after MD simulations. Also
interactions at S2/S3 sub-pockets have slightly changed with respect to starting docking
pose.
Regarding sub-pocket S2, it is composed by a flat surface as evidenced in Figure 6B.
However, it has been shown that S2 features substantial plasticity, enabling it to adapt to the
shape of inhibitor moieties.​[11]​ Potent alpha-ketoamide inhibitor 13b (pdb code 6Y2G) bears a
cyclopropyl methyl moiety at P2 that fits snugly into the enzyme S2 hydrophobic sub-pocket
(see reference 11). Unlike 13b, OTC does not target this hydrophobic region of S2 which
might explain the different shape that S2 adopts and also partially their differences in terms
of binding affinity.
CONCLUSIONS
In this work we have performed a virtual screening of FDA approved drugs for repurposing
as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease M​pro​.
Although other studies for drug repositioning as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 molecular targets
have already been reported, they focused mostly in antiviral medications. To our knowledge,
oxytetracycline, which is the most promising candidate selected in the current virtual
screening study has not been tested yet, neither in specific M​pro​ inhibitory assays nor in viral
replication assays. We encourage scientific community working on COVID-19 projects to
include it (along with the remaining selected candidates) in their experimental screening
pipelines.
