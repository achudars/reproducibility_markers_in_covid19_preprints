We analyze the effect of using a screening CT-scan for evaluation of potential COVID-19 infections
in order to isolate and perform contact tracing based upon a viral pneumonia diagnosis. RT-PCR is
then used for continued isolation based upon a COVID diagnosis. Both the low false negative rates
and rapid results of CT-scans lead to dramatically reduced transmission. The reduction in cases
after 60 days with widespread use of CT-scan screening compared to PCR by itself is as high as
50×, and the reduction of effective reproduction rate R(t) is 0.20. Our results imply that much more
rapid extinction of COVID is possible by combining social distancing with CT-scans and contact
tracing.

Testing and isolation is a foundation of COVID-19 prevention. However, the most common test, PCR, has a
false negative rate often reported to be 30% [1–3], varying with disease period, sampling method and processing materials. Individuals who test negative may resume
normal activities with family, roommates or in essential
services. Moreover, PCR test results typically take several days. Rapid point of care systems, available in some
locations, use the same sampling and analysis methods
so false negative rates are likely similar or worse. Recent
reports indicate 48% [4]. Serological tests are generally
not positive at onset of symptoms and do not indicate
that an individual is infectious at the time of the test.
Since effective at home isolation from family and roommates is difficult, isolation that is effective may not be
performed prior to receiving test results. Both the time
delay and those who are false negative may lead to many
additional new cases. Mild cases that do not progress to
severe may persist in being infectious for extended periods of time. These individuals are highly contagious
and therefore more harmful to transmission control than
asymptomatic carriers.
CT-scans have a reported small false negative rate for
viral pneumonia, including COVID, at onset of fever
or respiratory symptoms [5]. Test results are available
within minutes, and CT equipment is widespread [6]. For
example, there are about 15,000 CT imaging devices in
the US, of which over 5,000 are in ambulatory care locations. The scan itself takes seconds to perform, readings
in minutes. The time needed for cleaning and disinfecting
[8] can be mitigated (Appendix). Efficient intake can enable hundreds of tests per device per day [7]. The potential capacity of millions is large compared to the current
PCR testing of under 400,000 per day [12]. CT devices
and radiological services are underutilized currently due
to deferral of usual medical care. With a positive rate for
widely available testing only a few percent [9–11], conclusive test results promote focusing on ensuring those
who do test positive are isolated.
Figures 1 and 2 compare the impact of using CT-scans
and PCR on disease spread based upon a standard model
of transmission and social isolation for moderate and
strong social distancing. The daily infection rate is shown
for (red) PCR tests of only severe cases, (orange) PCR
tests for all cases regardless of severity, (blue) combined
use of CT-scans (as initial screening) and PCR. Dotted

social interventions is R∗ = 1.25 (see methods).

(see methods).

contacts.
Results indicate that isolating based upon a positive
CT-scan can address the false negative rate problem of
PCR, accelerating the decline of cases to eradicate the
disease. Confirmation of a COVID diagnosis (as opposed
to another viral pneumonia) using a PCR test may take
several days of testing. However, during this period a
CT-scan with findings of viral pneumonia can already
be used to effectively isolate positive cases. The number
of positive test results expected is about 1 in 20 of those

29% reduction, CT-scans for all with contact tracing of

reduction. The difference between PCR by itself and
CT-scans with PCR is 0.90 − 0.71 = 0.19, and between
both with 50% contact tracing is 0.80 − 0.58 = 0.22. 50%
contact tracing contributes a reduction of 0.10 and 0.13
for PCR and CT-scans respectively.

with early symptom tests, so the reduction in uncertainty
is high and efforts to isolate are much lower than would
otherwise be the case.
Using CT-scans leads to an infection reduction by 29×
and 35× after 60 days compared to PCR for severe cases
for moderate and strong social distancing respectively.
Compared to pervasive use of PCR the reduction is still
large: 16× and 18×. Contact tracing can be effective
when tests are done for mild cases. Contact tracing reduces cases for PCR tests by 4× for both, and for CTscans by 12× and 8×. Comparing PCR and CT-scan
with contact tracing the reduction is 50× and 35×. The
ratios continue to diverge exponentially over time. Thus,
rapid extinction of COVID is possible by combining CTscans and contact tracing.
The five testing methods can also be characterized by
effective reproduction ratios as follows: PCR for severe
cases: R∗ × 0.95 → 5% reduction, PCR for all cases:

Methods

Example simulations for the model are shown in Figures 3 and 4. The model is initialized with a number
N of infected agents. Their incubation periods are determined individually by a Weibull distribution (Fig. 3)
with α = 2.04 (95% CI: 1.80 − 2.32) and 1/λ = 0.103
(95% CI: 0.096 − 0.111)[13]. The percentage of mild or
moderate symptoms is 75% and for severe or critical conditions 20% [14]. The persistent asymptomatic proportion continues to be debated (perhaps because of false
negative PCR tests), here we set it to be 5% for Figs. 1
and 2, and perform a sensitivity analysis by varying the
percentage. The infectiousness of a patient as a function
of time after infection is simulated by a beta distribution, β(τ ) = B(τ /τ̃ ) (Fig. 4), with parameters α0 = 4,
β0 = 7 and τ̃ = 15 fit to established models [15]. The
reproduction rate, Rt , includes both the testing/isolation
strategy and the effect of other social interventions, given
by R∗ as indicated in the figures. For Figures 1 and 2
and the sensitivity analyses the model initially runs 20
days (t = −20 to −1) with test strategy 1 (described below) to represent under-testing in the initial phase. We
continue (t = 0 to t = 60) with one of the following test
and isolation strategies:
1. All severe and critical cases are tested. Mild and
moderate cases are not tested. There is a 4-day
delay between symptom onset and isolation due to
hospital capacity and PCR test turnaround time.
2. All symptomatic individuals are tested. There is
a 4-day delay between symptom onset and isolation for positive cases. Isolation does not occur for
false negative cases, which remain infectious until
a positive test result.
3. Same as 2) with contact tracing: 50% of contacts
are traced and quarantined once a case is identified.
4. All symptomatic cases are pre-screened by CTscan, and isolated if positive while waiting for PCR
to confirm. There is a 1-day delay between symptom onset and test/isolation.
5. Same as 4) with contact tracing: 50% of contacts
are traced and quarantined once a case is identified.
We adjust the initial number N of infections (day −20)
so that so that for each R∗ , 2,000 are infected at day 0.
All simulations compared with each other (same Figure)
have the same R∗ , and share the same simulation from
t = −20 to t = 0. Case numbers shown are the average

3
have also directly calculated in the agent model the values of R(t) including changes in the generation interval. Results are similar to Eq. 1, yielding an average
of the two cases simulated: R∗ × 0.95 → 5% reduction, PCR for all cases: R∗ × 0.89 → 11% reduction,
PCR for all cases with contact tracing of 50% of positive tested individuals: R∗ × 0.80 → 20% reduction, CTscan for all: R∗ × 0.72 → 38% reduction, CT-scan for all
with contact tracing of 50% of positive tested individuals:
R∗ × 0.61 → 39% reduction.
For additional confirmation we considered an analytic
calculation that assumes one test for either severe or mild
cases. The difference between pervasive PCR and CTscan tests can then be calculated as:

P
×((Fp + (1 − Fp )P τ w(τ )Ξ(τ + ∆p ))
−(Fc + (1 − Fc ) τ w(τ )Ξ(τ + ∆c )))
(2)
where w(τ ) is the Weibull distribution, Ξ(τ ) is the cumulative distribution of β(τ ). ∆p = 4, and ∆c = 1 are test
result delays for PCR and CT-scans from symptom onset.
The result is 0.18, in close agreement with simulations of
reference and other scenarios in sensitivity analysis.

of 60 runs. In the baseline scenario we conservatively allowed repeated tests to be performed every day, allowing
PCR tests to progressively identify more positive cases.
In one of the sensitivity analyses scenarios, mild cases
are only tested once. Contact tracing is initiated when a
case is identified by CT-scan or PCR, which happens at
least one day after symptom onset, and more days after
infection. The first day CT-scans are performed there is
a backlog of cases that are waiting for PCR test results.
All of these are scanned leading to a drop in transmission
due to quarantines.
The percentage of false negative results of PCR and
CT-scan are set to 30% and 5% respectively according to
various reports [1–3], and are varied in sensitivity analysis
below. Isolated cases, whether in hospital settings or
elsewhere, are assumed not to transmit (i.e. are not in
home isolation). When contact tracing is enabled, every
time a case is identified, either from PCR or CT-scan, a
fraction of all the individuals infected by this individual
agent are quarantined. The fraction is set to 0.5 in Fig.
1 and 2, and subject to sensitivity analysis below. Cases
quarantined through contact tracing do not transmit.
We obtain changes in effective reproduction rate as
follows: New cases at day T , can be represented as
T /τ
N (T ) = N Re 0 , where Re is the effective reproduction rate, and τ0 = 5 is taken to be the reference case
mean generation interval. Inverting and subtracting the
reference case we have
δRe = (N (T )/N )τ0 /T − (N ∗ (T )/N )τ0 /T

(1)

where N ∗ (T ) is the reference simulation at day T . We

In sensitivity analysis we consider: Repeated versus
single test, Asymptomatic proportion, CT-scan false negative rate, Contact tracing proportion, Stochasticity in
the dynamics.
Without multiple testing. In the baseline scenario
PCR tests or CT-scans are performed repeatedly on successive days on false negative results to progressively
identify more positive cases. If mild and moderate cases
are tested only once, the results are as shown in Fig. 7
and 8. Conclusions are unaffected.
Asymptomatic proportion. For a sensitivity analysis we simulate 40% mild/moderate cases, 10% severe/critical cases and 50% asymptomatic. Due to the
comparatively low transmissibility of asymptomatic cases
relative to symptomatic/presymtomatic cases [15], a similar observed transmission rate requires reducing the effectiveness of social distancing by increasing R∗ to 2.15
and 1.83. Results are shown in Figs. 9 and 10 and differ
only weakly from the reference case in Figs. 1 and 2.
Conclusions are unaffected. Note that we did not model
the reported utility of CT-scan in detecting otherwise
asymptomatic cases, which would provide an additional
advantage for CT-scan in this scenario.
CT-scan false negative rate. We simulate scenarios
where CT-scan has a higher false negative rate of 15%.
Results are shown in Figs. 11 and 12. While the proportions are different in detail, the essential conclusions are
unaffected.
Contact tracing effectiveness. Sensitivity analysis

and 75% are shown in Figs. 13 and 14.
Stochasticity. In order to give a sense of stochastic
variation, we report the mean, N̄ , and standard deviation, σ, of runs for the reference cases. Simulations in
Fig. 1, where R∗ = 1.25, have stochastic variation over
60 runs given by:

• PCR for all cases with contact tracing. N̄ = 248,
σ = 71

7, σ = 6

Where standard deviations are comparable to the mean,
multiple runs end with zero cases.
Summary of Sensitivity Analysis. Sensitivity
analysis confirms the baseline case is representative. Our
results imply that much more rapid extinction of COVID
is possible by combining social distancing with CT-scans
and contact tracing.

Appendix:

decontamination is needed to avoid cross infection [8].
Guidelines recommend cleaning with disinfectant for over
30 or 60 min [8, 16] but can be performed within minutes by UV exposure [17]. Guidelines recommend 5 air
exchanges [18]. HEPA purifiers are effective down to
the size of viral particles [19–21]. Standard room size
air purifiers perform 5 air exchanges per hour for, e.g.,
a 465 sq. ft. room [22]. An X min scan rate can be
achieved with 60/X purifiers (10 min with 6 purifiers, 6
min with 10 purifiers). Exchange rates can be adjusted
for smaller/larger rooms. Other mitigation practices are
appropriate including masks, designated CT machines,
peripheral devices at ambulatory providers, and mobile
CT equipment.

CT-scan FAQ. For COVID-19 screening a low dose
thin section CT-scan in supine position without contrast
is appropriate. Typical pattern is unilateral, multifocal
and peripherally-based ground glass opacities [1]. While
concerns about costs are often raised, the cost of such a
scan can be comparable to PCR. The potential for harms
from radiation associated with a single LDCT is negligible with minimal risk of adverse consequences. As with
low dose CT for lung cancer screening, additional findings
on the scans with diagnostic importance will be identified and can be managed according to well documented
guidelines from the American College of Radiology.
