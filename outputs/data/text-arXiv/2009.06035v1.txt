Abstract

Motivation: With the aim to amplify and make sense of interactions of virus-human proteins in the
case of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a structural analysis of the network of protein interactions
obtained from the integration of three sources: 1) proteins of virus SARS-CoV-2, 2)physical
interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins, 3) known interactions of these human
proteins between them and the dossier of affections in which these proteins are implicated.
Results: As a product of this research, we present two networks, one from the interactions
virus-host, and the other restricted to host-host, the last one is not usually considered for network
analysis. We identified the most important proteins in both networks, those that have the maximal
value of calculated invariants, these proteins are considered as the most: affected, connected or
those that best monitor the flow of information in the network, among them we find UBC, a human
protein related with ubiquination, linked with different stages of coronavirus disease, and ORF7A a
virus protein that induces apoptosis in infected cells, associated with virion tethering. Using the
constructed networks, we establish the more significant diseases corresponding with human
proteins and their connections with other proteins. It is relevant that the identified diseases coincide
with comorbidities, particularly the subnetwork of diabetes involves a great quantity of virus and
human proteins (56%) and interactions (60%), this could explain the effect of this condition as an
important cause of disease complications.

Introduction

Coronaviridae (CoVs) are single-stranded RNA viruses that cause
respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological diseases of varying severity
in a broad range of hosts (Woo et al. 2009). They have the ability to
transmit from animals-to-human and human-to-human, as in the case of
the several acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 and the
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (Cauchemez et al.
2013, Cui et al. 2019).
CoVs are subdivided in four genera, where, a) Alphacoronavirus are
responsible for gastrointestinal disorders in human, dogs, pigs, and cats;
b) Betacoronavirus including the Bat coronavirus (BCoV), the human
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and the Middle Eastern
respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus; (c) Gammacoronavirus, which
infect avian species; and d) Deltacoronavirus, which infect avian and pig
species (Woo et al. 2012).
In December 2019, a novel Betacoronavirus (2019-nCoV) was
identified from the province of Wuhan, China (Lu et al 2020). It has
been causally linked to severe respiratory infections in humans. At time
of writing, 26.7 million cases of 2019-nCov have been reported in the
World and there are currently 876’616 deaths linked to this pathogen
(source: World Health Organization report, 06 September 2020).
Phylogenetic relationships suggest that the origin of this new coronavirus
is the pangolin (Xiaolu et al. 2020). Although there are advances in the
development of a vaccine for 2019-nCoV, there are some challenges to
face, including massive testing and large-scale production. Thus, in order

to continue to understand how the virus works, we exhaustively
evaluated its interactome.
Last studies that are being addressed include topics like: the
HCoV–host interactome and drug targets in the human protein–protein
interaction network (Zhou et al. 2020), comprehensive structural
genomics and interactomics roadmaps of SARS-CoV-2 to infer the
possible functional differences and similarities with the associated SARS
coronavirus (Srinivasan et al. 2020), the search of master regulators of
the SARS-CoV-2/Human interactome (Guzzi et al. 2020). These
approaches
have used networks as an adequate mathematical
approximation to represent and to study several aspects of the same
problem. Network analysis has its basis in graph theory (Pavlopoulos
2011), graphs are mathematical objects composed of vertices and edges,
or arrows when network is directed. This approach has been associated
with several study areas, between them systems biology and cell
signaling research. To study the topological aspects of networks,
incorporating information about the general and specific properties of
vertices, edges, modules, cycles, paths, relevant elements and other
components within the network, gives insights into the governing
fundamentals of the biological systems and captures their complexity
(Ma'ayan 2011).
In this study, we compile the network of SARS-CoV-2/human
interactome reported in several papers and databases, and interlace them
with the information of the human protein interactions and the analysis
of the diseases in which these proteins are involved. In our case, the
network is considered as undirected, where every vertex corresponds to a
protein, either virus or human and each edge means a physical

Luna-Olivera et al.

interaction between SARSCoV-2 and human proteins or human-human
proteins. By one hand we identified important vertices from the point of
view of network structure using different approaches from network
theory, also concepts of connectivity and cointeraction can give insights
about essential interactions and proteins, and by other hand we
constructed and analyzed the subnetwork of human proteins involved in
diseases and their relations with other human and virus proteins.
We consider this study will contribute to prospect studies to increase
our knowledge on the interactions of SARSCoV-2 - humans. In follow ,
we describe the methods and computations that were done in order to get
the topological information from the network. Section 3 is devoted to
results. Finally, we present the conclusions and discussion of this study
in.

Methods

2.1 Interactome network for SARS-CoV-2/Human Cell
interaction

We use two complementary types of data for this study. A network
was constructed for SARS-CoV-2/human interactome and another
complementary network was constructed for the human/human
interactome corresponding to the interactions between human proteins
involved with the virus proteins, next we describe the characteristics and
information sources of both.
SARS-CoV-2 proteins were considered as in (Yoshimoto 2020),
taking into account the expressed proteins by the genes: ORF1ab (NSP1
to NSP16), ORF2 (S: Spike glycoprotein or Surface glycoprotein),
ORF3a, ORF4 (E: Envelope small membrane protein), ORF5 (M:
Membrane glycoprotein), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9 (N:
Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein or Nucleoprotein), and ORF10. We add
ORF9b because this protein blocks interferon, a key molecule in defense
against viruses, Type I IFN antagonist (Estrada 2020) and ORF14, since
according to the Multiple Sequence Alignment, ORF14 of SARS-CoV-2
have 77.14% identity with Human-SARS and 92.86% identity with Bat
CoV (Wu et al. 2020) .
SARS-CoV-2/human interactome was constructed considering 206
interactions virus/virus and virus/host. It contains 33 virus proteins, 6 of
which do not interact with human proteins. In brief, interactions were
determined from characterizing viral, intra-viral and human–virus
protein complexes, extracting the information on their interaction
interfaces and ligand-binding, and superposed the evolutionary
difference and conservation information with the binding information
(Srinivasan et al 2020). This information was complemented with the
network described in BioGRID (Oughtred 2019), which contains 362
virus/virus and virus/host interactions. This database reports 31 virus
proteins of which 5 do not interact with human proteins (Gordon 2020,
Wang K 2020, Bestle D 2020). In addition, 294 interactions of
SARS-CoV-2-Human Protein-Protein network, with 26 viral proteins,
which was also used to assemble the network were obtained from
VirHostNet 2.0 (Guirimand 2015, Gordon et. al 2020). In VirHostNet,
interactions were obtained cloning, tagging and expressing 26 of the 29
SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identifying the human proteins
physically associated using affinity-purification mass spectrometry
(AP-MS), Finally, we considered the information from ViralZone, that
presents 14 virus proteins without interactions (Hulo 2011). We add two
important products of genes with unknown interaction: CTSB, CTSL
reported in The Human Protein Atlas (Uhlén 2015).
Therefore, considering the information retrieved from diverse
databases, we proceed to construct the interactome network between 404
human proteins involved in interactions with SARS Cov-2 proteins.
Human/human interactome was constructed from diverse sources,
String-db provided an interactome human/human network with 1088
protein-protein interactions, in a search of multiple Proteins by Names /
Identifiers (Szklarczyk 2019). PICKLE (Gioutlakis 2017) provides a
network with 198 interactions in a search of interactions between the
selected interactors, their information is obtained from other databases
(BioGRID, MINT, HPRD, IntAct and DIP), information about
interaction type and the detection method is also reported, for instance:
pull down, enzymatic study, AP-MS, biochemical, cross linking study,
protein kinase assay, and x-ray crystallography. We performed a
random search in HuRI(Luck 2020), which returns 238 interactions
between the human proteins affected by the virus. Finally, the resulting

interactome includes 432 proteins and 1792 interactions, 404 are human
proteins and 28 are virus proteins.

2.2 Structural analysis

We consider that every vertex v has a degree k(v) , calculated as the
number of incident edges on the vertex. The degree distribution was
calculated taking into account the relative frequency of appearance for
every degree. To deal computationally with a network some programs
like Octave (Eaton 2015) use the adjacency matrix B , which is
constructed with inputs buv taking buv = 1 and bvu = 1 if there is an
edge between v and u a​ nd 0 in other cases.
Connectivity in graph theory includes paths, cycles and connected
components. A path is a sequence of vertices and edges on the network,
such that the initial vertex of the sequence is not the same as the end
vertex, and no edges neither vertices are allowed to be duplicated. A
cycle is a closed path where the initial and final vertices are the same, the
length of the cycle is given by the number of edges in it. In this regard, a
graph is connected if there is a path between any two vertices. A network
can be composed of several connected components bearing there are
groups of proteins that interact separately in the network, a measure
which could be suitable in the search of biological groups. In the section
of results, we describe
the connected components for
SARS-CoV-2/Human interactome network.
Clustering
coefficient
was
also
calculated
for
the
SARS-CoV-2/human interactome network, this invariant helps us to
measure for each vertex if their neighboring vertices are also neighbors
between them, that is, it measures the transitivity. For every vertex v the
clustering coefficient of the vertex is given by the formula
2E v
C v = (K(v) )(K(v)
(4)
−1)
where E v is the number of edges between the neighbors of v (Junker
2008).
The simplest centrality is the degree centrality (DC), which gives for
every vertex ​v a measure of the relative connectivity of a vertex in the
network (Junker and Schreiber), it is calculated as the degree of the
vertex over n-1,​ this is the maximum possible degree in a network with ​n
vertices. Other centralities considered in this study are divided in two
groups: eigenvector centrality and pagerank centrality, associated with
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, on the other
hand we utilize closeness centrality and betweenness centrality which
consider the shortest path distance from a vertex to other vertices.
Eigenvector centrality designates the significance of a vertex
proportionally to the importance of their neighbors, then a vertex is
significant because it is connected to many vertices or because it is
connected to vertices with large eigenvector centralities. The value of
this centrality in each vertex v is obtained by using the adjacency
matrix ​B,​ their largest eigenvalue λn and an initial vector xv (0) , we get
the value in v by the iteration of function
xv (t + 1) =

1
λn

∑ Bxv (t)
u

(1)

The sum is over all the vertices u in the network. A connected
network ensures that we can obtain a fixed value xv after a finite number
of iterations. A usual x (0) in computational algorithms is the
eigenvector associated to λn .
Pagerank centrality is calculated similarly, with the difference that in the
previous sum λ1n and B are substituted by a weighted matrix C , where
B
the value of the input cuv is given by K outuv(u) ​(Langville 2005).
Closeness centrality of a vertex v is defined as the reciprocal of the sum
of the length of the shortest paths between the vertex v and all other
vertices u in the graph, it is calculated as
C clo (v) = n−1n−1
(2)
∑ d(u,v)

v=1

where d(u, v ) is the shortest-path distance between v and u , and n is
the number of vertices in the network.
The betweenness centrality of a vertex v is the sum of the fraction of
all-pairs shortest paths that pass through v , it is calculated as
C Bet (v) = ∑

st,∈V

σ(s,t|v)
σ(s,t)

(3)

Network of SARS-CoV-2/Human

where σ (s, t|v) denote the number of shortest paths between s and t
that use v as an interior vertex, and σ (s, t) is the total number of
shortest paths between s and t .
Finally, in this study we perform the calculus of vertex energy as a
measure of importance. For any matrix C , its trace is denoted by T r(C)
and its absolute value (CC * ) by |M | . The energy of the graph G is
given by
n
ξ(G) = T r(|B|) = ∑ |B|
(5)
i=1

for a good reference of the energy of a graph see (Li 2012), and for
recent applications see (Gutman 2020). For a vertex v i , its energy is
defined (Arizmendi 2018) by
ξ G (v i ) = |B|ii,
(6)
and there are not known applications.

2.3 Enrichment analysis

To identify the enriched disease for human proteins, we used the
Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID; http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/), which is a gene functional
classification system that integrates a set of functional annotation tools
(Huang et al. 2008). From this, we found 11 groups of diseases, and 105
affected proteins (See additional material), we identified cliques of
proteins involved in groups of diseases and for every clique of proteins
we prospect the first neighbors proteins, that are divided in human or
virus proteins, this first neighbors proteins which ​could also be related to
these diseases. For every ​group of diseases we constructed a subnetwork
which contains: the ​clique of proteins identified by enrichment, first
human and virus neighbors and ​their interactions observed in VHN, this
permits us to perceive the effect of proteins involved in diseases.

2.4 Algorithms and implementation

Algorithms were implemented in Networkx from Python (Rossum
2020). The following routines are already included in Networkx: Degree,
Eigenvector centrality, connected components, Katz centrality,
Closeness centrality and Betweenness centrality. In additional material
we provide the algorithms to find: degree distribution, and vertex energy.
As a negative control we construct random Erdos-Renyi networks with
the same number of vertices and interactions to contrast the results of
invariants.

Results

3.1 Degree, degree distribution and connectivity
The resulting interactome including human/human and virus/human
interactions proteins consists of 432 proteins and 1792 interactions, this
is the virus/human network (VHN), of these edges 123 are auto
interactions, that is to say around 7%, it is organized in only one
connected component.
The interactome of the proteins involved with the virus is of 404
proteins and 1247 interactions and is represented in a human/human
interactome network (HHN). It contains 107 auto interactions, this is
roughly 8.5%, and it is organized in one giant connected component with
299 proteins (on which the following calculations are presented), 2
connected components of size 2, and the rest of vertices are isolated or
auto interacting, meaning at this level are the virus proteins that unite the
network.
In biological networks, degree and degree distribution are outstanding
because they help to elucidate the global structure of the network. In this
context, we identified that excluding the auto interactions, for VHN the
vertex with maximum degree is ORF7A with degree 60, followed by
NSP13 with degree 52 and NSP7 and UBC with degree 51, the minimum
degree is 1 and 92 vertices reach this degree, the mean is 7.7, variance
67 and median 5. The adjustment of degree distribution is given by the
equation y = 200x−1.35 (Figure 1A).
In HHN the vertex with maximum degree is UBC with degree 50,
followed by HNRNPA1 with degree 30, and DDX5 with degree 27. The
mean is 7.6, variance 39, and median 6. The adjustment of degree
distribution is given by the equation y = 113.78x−1.18 (Figure 1B).

3.2 Clustering coefficient
We found that the highest clustering coefficient in both networks is 1, i.
e​. vertices whose neighbors are all connected between them forming
complete graphs denoted by K n for n vertices.
For VHN clustering coefficient equal to 1 was found for BCL2A1 with
degree 4; and for AASS, TPSAB1, TPSB2, KIAA1033, DCAKD and
CCDC86 which possess a degree of 2, meaning we found triangles.
Otherwise, 92 vertices has a clustering coefficient equal to 0, and degree
1, which corresponds to 21% of vertices in the network; whereas 66
vertices have different degrees, from 2 to 6, and clustering coefficient of
0, these are called stars in graph theory, and are subgraphs composed of
one central vertex and its neighbors, being the most notorious the
proteins NSP5, MKRN3, PPT1 and PKHF2. The mean of clustering
coefficient for the network is 0.19, with a variance of 0.05, and median
0.13. This average indicates that neighbors have 1/5 of connections they
could have.
For HHN, we found in 9 vertices, a clustering coefficient of 1, for TRM1
with degree 7, meaning K 8 is present in this network, NUP58 with
degree 5 give place to K 6 . We obtain K 5 with TIM29, PGES2,
BCL2A1, NGLY1 of degree 3. We also found vertices with different
degrees and clustering coefficient 0, being the most notorious the protein
HMOX1 with 7 neighbors, and EMC1, SGTA, DPH5 with 6. The mean
of clustering coefficient for the network is 0.24, with a variance of 0.05
and median 0.2, this average indicates that neighbors have 1/4 of
connections they could have. Vertices with clustering coefficients equal
to 1 are radically different in VHN and HHN, meaning that interactions
with virus proteins affect the original complete pieces in HHN
introducing new interactions and creating new complete graphs with
other proteins. The clustering coefficient by degree is presented in Figure
1C and 1D​.

3.3 Centralities
Centralities for the VHN network are compared in Table 1, we present
the top ten vertices with the highest centrality values in each case. As we
can see, some elements are consistently repeated in several centrality
measures, for instance human protein UBC, and virus protein NSP8 are
identified in all centralities. Followed by NSP7, NSP13, ORF7A and
NSP12 all virus proteins. Next in frequency are: DDX5, HNRPA1 from
humans and M and ORF8 from viruses.

To evaluate the structure of the networks with respect to chance, we
reconstruct random networks with the same number of nodes and
interactions. We found that random networks are significantly different
from real. Degree and eigenvector centralities present a normal
distribution and lower values, as well as vertex energy. Contrary to what
happened in VHN and HHN, in random networks there are no vertices
with clustering coefficients equal to one and there is a big difference
between the values ​of betweenness centrality. Notoriously closeness
centrality does not have variation in its distribution, meaning is not an
invariant to allow distinguish between VHN, HHN and random networks
of type Erdos-Renyi.

The eleven diseases enriched in the VHH network found using DAVID (Huang et
al. 2008).

3.4 Diseases proteins
From the enrichment analysis we found eleven cliques of proteins
related with diseases, each group of diseases is shown in the first column
of Table 3 and the number of proteins taking part in it is mentioned in
the second column. The number of first neighbors of every clique that
are human proteins is mentioned as NHP and the number of first
neighbors of every clique that are virus proteins is mentioned as NVP,
the number of interactions in the subnet is reported as NI. The same
information can be visualized in Fig. 2.
From the enrichment analysis we found that the human proteins
BCL2, GPX1, RIPK1, VKGC and VKORC1 are involved in diverse
diseases (4).
From the neighbor search we detect 23 virus proteins interacting with
proteins involved in diseases, the most common is ORF7A present in 9
groups of diseases, excluding only: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
and HIV Infections|Sexually Transmitted Diseases. There are 261 human
proteins related to disease proteins, the most common are: COMT, PPIG
and VKORC1, which are involved in 7 diseases at the same time. At the
structural level, these proteins play as links between diseases, which
allows a completely connected structure of the network.
Examining every subnetwork by disease, we found that the most
extended contained in VHN is the subnetwork corresponding to: Type 2
Diabetes, edema and rosiglitazone. There are 100 human proteins that
appear in this subnetwork but are not related with any other disease.
NSP1, NSP2 and NSP3 are viral proteins exclusively involved in
Diabetes.
ORF6 is exclusive for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,
Disease Progression. ACE2 is identified as an important protein involved
in Acquired Immunodeficiency, Type 2 Diabetes| edema | rosiglitazone,
Colorectal Cancer, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, HIV
Infections|Sexually Transmitted Diseases. The three last diseases in
Table 3 share the same vertices and thus the same virus and human
neighbors.
Table 3. ​We present the groups of diseases found in enrichment
analysis, the number of proteins involved in diseases (NP), the number
of first neighbors of this proteins clique, which could be human (NHP)
or virus proteins (NVP) and the final number of interactions (NI) in the
sunetwork corresponding to the disease group.

Discussion

In this work we integrate the SARS-CoV-2/human interactome and
interlace them with the information of the human protein interactions
and the analysis of the diseases in which these proteins are involved.
The first topological invariant we observe are degrees, related in some
works with level of expression and indispensability (Estrada 2006,
Giménez 2016), in this case the most connected protein in the VHN is
ORF7A, it interacts with 60 other proteins that include 5 viral proteins
and 55 human proteins. ORF7A directly binds to BST-2 (also known as
CD317 or tetherin) and inhibits its activity by blocking the glycosylation
of BST-2 (Taylor et al 2015), in addition ORF7a can induces apoptosis
in infected cells, contributing to the damage in the lugs (Yeung 2016).
Another highly connected node is NSP13 that interacts with other 52
proteins. NSP13 It is a helicase that unpacks viral genome material to
make it more accessible, it adopts a triangular pyramid shape comprising
five domains (Mirza and Froeyen 2020).
The most important protein in the HHN network is UBC, which is at
the same time the most connected protein that interacts with other 50
human proteins. It is a polyubiquitin-C and it plays a key role in
maintaining cellular ubiquitin levels under stress conditions.
Another important node in the HHN network due to its connectivity
and centrality is HNRNPA1, it is a heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1,
it is targeted by viruses to control various stages in their life cycle:
replication, transcription, post transcriptional modification like nuclear
export/import, and translation (Kaur and Lal 2020) and DDX5 is a RNA
binding protein, it plays multifunctional roles and is involved in all
aspects of RNA metabolism (Jalal et al 2007).
Difference of degree between VHN and HHN provides information
about the human proteins more affected by virus proteins, which in this
case are the proteins: SERPING1 with 6 new interactions, DCTN2 with
4 new interactions and PPIA with 3 new interactions. SERPING1 is a C1
inhibitor, a type of serine protease inhibitor (serpin). Serpins help control
several types of chemical reactions by blocking the activity of certain
proteins. C1 inhibitor is important for controlling a range of processes
involved in maintaining blood vessels, including inflammation.
Inflammation is a normal body response to infection, irritation, or other
injury (Yurchenko et al. 2010). PPIA encoded a Cyclophilins A can bind
and activate the transmembrane receptor CD147. Cyclophilins play a
critical role in the replication process of HIV-1, HCV and many other
viruses (Pushkarsky et al. 2001). DCTN2 encodes a Dynactin, Dynactin
binds to both microtubules and cytoplasmic dynein. It is involved in a
diverse array of cellular functions, including ER-to-Golgi transport, the
centripetal movement of lysosomes and endosomes, spindle formation,
chromosome movement, nuclear positioning, and axonogenesis.

Network of SARS-CoV-2/Human

We calculated centrality measures for vertices into the network in
order to find essential proteins, in (Estrada 2006) author indicates that
essential proteins generally have more interactions than the nonessential
ones and associates lethality with the remotion of proteins with high
centralities in the yeast proteome, also indicates that choose essential
proteins considering their high centralities is significantly better than
random selections.
In the VHN the most central node according to degree centrality is
ORF7A. NSP7 and NSP8 are identified as the most central nodes
according to Closeness and Betweenness centralities, which implies
these proteins are the nodes that are able to spread the information very
efficiently through the network and they are the nodes that best monitor
the flow of information in the network. NSP7 and NSP8 are cofactors
that interact with NSP12 to form the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex
(Peng et al 2020).
NSP13 has the highest vertex energy, though there are not known
applications of this invariant it seems to compile the information of other
three centralities: degree, betweenness and closeness centrality in a
unique measure. while UBC is the most central according to eigenvector
centrality, which indicates that this node is connected to other highly
connected nodes.
On the other hand, in the VHH network the most central node in all
the centralities is UBC, it is admitted that ubiquitination is related with
several important cellular functions like: DNA repair, cell cycle
regulation, kinase modification, endocytosis, and regulation of other cell
signaling pathways, moreover in (Raaben et al 2010) identified that the
ubiquitin proteasome system was involved in several steps of infection
of coronavirus.
An important aspect of SARS-CoV-2, is the susceptibility of infection
of patients with certain comorbidities that can trigger higher mortality.
The most recurrent comorbidities are Cardiovascular diseases,
Hypertension, Diabetes, Chronic obstructive pulmonary syndrome,
Chronic kidney disease and Cancer (Gold et al 2020, Bajgain et al 2020).
In this context, we identified 11 enrichment groups of proteins related
with diseases (Fig. 2), we found these groups are related to previously
described comorbidities, which indicate that the interactions between the
SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and human proteins are intensified with
these comorbidities.
The most abundant group is the related to Type 2 Diabetes| edema |
rosiglitazone, this consists of 60 human proteins, as well as, 21 viral
proteins. We identified that NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3 are proteins that are
exclusively found in diabetes subnetwork. NSP1can inhibit IFN
signaling and block the host innate immune response by promotion of
cellular degradation and blocks translation of host’s RNA (Kamitani et al
2006). NSP2 interacts with a host protein complex of PHB1 and PHB2
involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (Kumar et al 2020), it is the major
virulence factor which suppresses host gene expression by binds to 40S
and 80S ribosomes (Thoms et al. 2020). NSP3 Promoting cytokine
expression and cleavage of viral polyprotein (Astuti 2020).
Another important aspect in the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the
formation of Blood clots in the patients (Lemke and Silverman 2020). In
this context, four groups of diseases identified are related to effects in the
blood: 1) Apoplexy | Atherosclerosis | Stroke that are involved in internal
bleeding, blood flow deficiency and arterial blockage; 2) Venous
thromboembolism which is a disorder that includes deep vein thrombosis
and pulmonary embolism; 3) Warfarin which is a vitamin K antagonist
and inhibits synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII,
IX, X) and 4) proteins C and S, two proteins in the blood that help
regulate blood clot formation.
Particularly in Protein C Protein S disorder, and this affectation may
be due to the interactions between ORF7A and VKORC1 which is
Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1, which is involved in
vitamin K metabolism. Vitamin K is required for the
gamma-carboxylation of various proteins, including clotting factors, and
is required for normal blood coagulation. The interaction of these viral
proteins with human proteins may explain the failure at the global level
present in Sar-CoV-2 patients.
In conclusion, this study not only offers an integrative network-based
system that allows finding important nodes in the interaction of
SARS-CoV-2 and the human proteome, which empower the
identification of possible markers for response to drugs, but also
provides a feasible explanation of comorbidities.

diseases and it is represented by three sets of nodes: blue nodes make up the clique of
human proteins identified as disease elements in enrichment analysis, red and gray nodes
are first neighbors of this clique of proteins, virus and host proteins respectively.
Interactions were taken as in VHN.
