Abstract
After March 2020, the environment surrounding football has changed dramatically due to COVID19 pandemic. After a few months’ break, the re-scheduled matches have been held behind the closed
door without spectators. The main objective of this study is a quantitative evaluation of “crowd effects”
on home advantage, using the match results of the closed matches. The proposed analysis uses pairwise
comparison method in order to reduce the effects caused by unbalanced schedule. The following conclusion
can be drawn from some statistical hypothesis tests: In four major European leagues, the home advantage
is reduced in closed matches compared to normal situation with spectators. The reduction amount among
leagues is different. In Germany, it shows the negative home advantage during the closed period. On the
other hand, in England, statistically significant difference cannot be found between closed and normal
situations.

I. Introduction
After March 2020, the environment surrounding football has changed dramatically — due to
COVID-19 pandemic. Most of football leagues had been forced to be suspended, similar to many
other crowd-pleasing events. Some of the leagues had been calcelled, while others resumed
after a few months’ break. The resumed leagues, however, no decision was made to bring the
spactators as before the suspension. The re-scheduled matches has been held behind the closed
door without spactators.
The objective of this paper is to analyse how this unfortunate and unacceptable closed situation affected the match outcome of football. In particular, our main objective is a quantitative
evaluation of “crowd effects” on home advantage.
Today, it seems that the existence of “home advantage” in sports, especially football, cannot
be questioned[1][2][3]. However, there is still no definitive evidence on the factors that produce
home advantage. Of course, the quantitative impact of each factor on home advantage has also
been discussed.
“Home advantage” can be defined as that home teams consistently win more than 50 percent
of the games under a blanced home-and-away schedule[4]. Quantitative research on home advantage in football dates back nearly 40 years ago to Morris[5], then, Dowie[6] and Pollard[2]
followed. In a very brief and thorough review paper on home advantage[7], consisting of only
three pages, Pollard presented eight main factors that could generate home advantage and explained conventional studies for each (of course, he did not forget to mention those interactions
1

and other factors). The first one is “’crowd effect”, i.e, effect caused by spactators. In [7], he wrote
that “This is the most obvious factor involved with home advantage and one that fans certainly
believe to be dominant[8][9].” Studies by Dowie[6] and Pollard[2] could find very little evidence
that home advantage depends on crowd density (spectators per stadium capacity).
This paper utilizes the results of matches behind closed door held under the influence of
the COVID-19 pandemic to determine the relationship between the presence of spectators and
home advantage. Reade et al. used the results of the matches behind closed door since 2003 and
reported a study on crowd effect[10]. The number of the matches in empty studium, however,
is small (160 out of approx. 34 thousand matches). In addition, in these closed matches, teams
have typically been banned from admitting supporters into their stadiums as punishments for
bad behaviour off the football pitch (e.g., due to corruption, racist abuse, or violence). Therefore,
in this analysis, spactators’ characteristics could be biased, e.g., they were excessively violent or
doing overly aggressive supporting behavior.
When making use of the results of these closed matches, it should also be noted that the
schedule is unbalanced. Many European league matches are about two-thirds completeed by
mid-March suspension. It should be considered the possible bias for the strength of home teams
in the reseumed matches after the break. Most of famous and extensive previous studies on home
advantage[11] and the latest report [12] used only several basic statistics, e.g., numbe of goals,
fouls, and wins. It should be pointed out that they could be biased under unbalanced schedule.
For the problem on biased scheldule, in this paper, assume a statistical model the explains
match results from the team strength parameters for each team and the home advantage parameter that is common for every team in the league. By fitting the paramters in this model to
minimize explanation error, separate the home advantage even from the unbalanced schedule.
The specific techniques are as follows: each team i has one strength evaluation value ri called
“rating”. And one league has one parameter rhomeAdv that expresses home advantage. The
strength difference ∆r is expressed by the difference of rating values between the teams indexed
by i and j added by the home advantage, i.e., ∆r = ri + rhomeAdv − r j . The strength difference
explains the score ratio in a match via logistic regression model, i.e., 1/(1 + exp(−∆r )).
The rating values ri and the home advantage value rhomeAdv at a particular date is estimated
by using themost recent match results, e.g., five matchweeks. This calculation process is repeated
for every matchweek. The home advantage value estimated only from the closed matches are
compared to those of from the past “normal” match results.
This paper is organized as follows: Section II states on the data and the detaied algorithm used
in this study. This paper analysis on the five major top divition of European football leagues –
England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain (in France, the top division has not been resumed
after the suspension). The match results are collected from 2010-2011 season. Section III states statistical analysis results. The following conclusion can be drawn from some statistical hypothesis
tests.
• In four major European leagues, the home advantage is reduced without spactators comaperd
to normal situation with spactators.
• The reduction amount among leagues is different.
• For all four leagues, the home advantage still remains even in closed matches.
Section IV summarizes and concludes this paper.

This study analyses the home advantage in the top divisions in five European countries –
England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. They are considered as the most major and highestquality football leagues among the world. The match results from 2010-2011 season are collected
from worldfootball.net (https://www.worldfootball.net/). The number of maches are 17729,
including 430 closed matches.
All five leagues were suspended from mid-March due to COVID-19 pandemic. Four leagues
except France resumed until late-June, and finished until early-August. Ligue 1 in France quickly
decided and announced its calcellation at the end of April[13].

Mathematical model

We propose a unified and simple statistical estimation method of scoring ratios based on the
score in each match, which is always officially recorded and is common to all ball games. This
method is an extention of [14] as to incorporate home advantage. The study[14] reported that his
propsed method achieved higher prediction accuracy for ten events of five sports e.g., basketball,
handball, hockey, volleyball, and water polo, in the Rio Olympic Games compared to the official
world rankings.

3

Assume that the scoring ratio of a home team i in a match against an away team j (i and j are
team indices), denoted as p i,j , is estimated as
pi,j =

1
1+e

−(r i +r homeAdv−r j )

,

(1)

where ri is defined as the rating of team i and rhomeAdv is quantitative value of home advantage.
Given (si , s j ), the actual scores in a match between i and j,
si,j =

si + 1
= pi,j + ǫi,j ,
si + 1 + s j + 1

(2)

where si,j and ǫi,j are the modified actual scoring ratio and the estimation error, respectively. In
football, shut-out results such as 1 − 0 or 3 − 0 occur frequently. Thus, a simple scoring ratio, i.e.,
si
si,j = s +
s , can result in invalid strength evaluation. Therefore, the score of each team is added by
i

j

one. This modification is known as Colley’s method[15], and was originally used to rank college
(American) football teams.
This mathematical structure is the well-known logistic regression model. It is widely used in
areas such as the winning probability assumption of Elo ratings in chess games[16], and the
correct answer probability for questions in item response theory[17].
The update method is designed to minimize the sum of the squared error E2 between the
result and the prediction , defined by the following equation:
E2 =

∑

(si,j − pi,j )2 .

(3)

( i,j )∈all matches

It is straightforward to obtain the following update based on the steepest-descent method:
ri ← ri − α ·

∂E2
∂E2
, rhomeAdv ← rhomeAdv − α ·
,
∂ri
∂rhomeAdv

(4)

where α is a constant.
By definition, the rating is an interval scale. Therefore, its origin, r = 0, can be selected
arbitrarily and a constant value can be added to all ri . For example,
r ← r − (max r ) · 1

(5)

implies that r = 0 always shows the highest rating, and r < 0 shows the distance from the top
team.
ii.1 Convert rating on scoring ratio to winning probability
The rating ri in (1) explains the scoring ratio. Once we have the scoring ratio p i,j given in (1),
assume that the following independent Bernoulli process is executed N times, starting from
(si , s j ) = (0, 0) and with the parameter 0 < β ≤ 1.

 si ← si + 1
s ← sj + 1
 j
si ← si , s j ← s j

with probability
with probability
with probability

βpi,j ,

β 1 − pi,j ,
(1 − β ) .

(6)

This is a unified (and approximated) model of a scoring process for all ball games, where si and
s j model the scores of teams i and j, respectively.
4

The parameters N and β vary among the sports and between definitions of a unit of play. For
example, in basketball, if a unit of play is defined as 10[s], we have N = 40[min] × 60[s]/10 = 240.
In football, if a unit of play is defined as 1[min], we have N = 90. For both sports, β is determined
as β = E(si + s j )/N.
At the end of the match, si > s j shows that team i wins against team j. Figure 1 shows the
simulated winning probability for different Nβ and rating gap (ri − r j ), with N = 240. This
probability is expressed by the cumulative distribution function for a normal distribution. In
many applications, it is common to use a logistic regression model rather than a cumulative
distribution[18].

Rating Gap

Figure 1: Rating gap and winning probability

Based on the discussions above, we convert the rating on the scoring ratio to that of a winning
probability, as follows:
wi,j = 1 (i wins), 0.5 (draw), or 0 ( j wins),

(7)

which denotes a win, draw, or loss for team i against team j. Find Dk∗ , where k is an index of
sports, that satisfies
1
 ,
ŵi,j =
(8)
1 + exp − Dk ri + rhomr Adv − r j
2
(9)
Dk∗ = arg min ∑ wi,j − ŵi,j .
Dk

Then, ri is converted as follows:
r̄i = Dk∗ ri , i = 1, 2, · · · , NT , and homeAdv,

(10)

where NT denotes the number of teams. Therefore, r̄homeAdv is a quantitative home advantage
estimation that explains the effect on the winning probability.
In Equations (3) and (9), the sum of squared errors are used as a loss function instead of the
cross-entropy. This is because these problems are regression problems, not classification ones.

iii.

Short-term estimation of home advantage

The proposed method in the previous section is used to estimate the rating of each team and the
home advantage in the league using the results of the last five matchweeks, including itself, for
every matchweek.
By using five matchweeks, we can estimate the average of each team’s strength and leaguewide home advantage over approximately from three weeks to one month.
The calculated home advantage is classified into the following four classes based on the spactator attendence.
• Past: The home advantage calculated using the matches from 2010-2011 to 2018-2019 seasons. It includes closed matches as punishments, if exist.
• Normal: The home advantage calculated using the matches before suspension in 2019-2020.
The matches are basically with spactators. Note that closed matches as punishments are
inclused here, if exist.
• Mixed: The home advantage calculated using the matches in which with and without
spactators are mixed.
• Closed: The home advantage calculated using the matches without spactators.

III. Results and discussions
This chapter describes the analysis results and discussions.

i.

Basic stats

Figure 2 depicts the basic stats, e.g., goals difference per match and win ratio difference, in normal
and closed periods.
From this counting, home teams goal approximately from 0.3 to 0.5 more per match than
away teams in average under the “past and normal” situation. As a result, the home teams
win more approximately 0.15 to 0.25 against the away teams. In addition, it seems obvious that
the home advantage is reduced under the closed situation. Especially, in Bundesliga, the goals
difference and win ratio difference are both negative in the closed matches. In this counting,
however, possible schedule unbalance for the closed matches is not considered. In other words,
it is possible that the most of the home teams are consistently weak (or strong) in the closed
matches.

ii.

Estimation of home advantage

Figure 3 shows the estimation results of the home advantage r̄homeAdv in five leagues. The medians
are all positive for every four classes. This means that the home advantage remains even if the
match is closed and without spactators. The medians in the past and normal periods looks
similar. On the other hand, the median in the closed period is smaller than those of the past and
the normal periods.
We tested null hypotheses that the home advantage r̄homeAdv from two different categories are
samples from continuous distributions with equal medians. Wilcoxon’s rank sum test[19, 20] is
used as a test method because any assumption on the shape of the distribution of r̄homeAdv can
be posed. p−values between classes are depicted in Figure 3, and Table 3 summarizes the test
result.
From these test results, the followings can be concluded.

• There is no significant difference in home advantage between the past and 2019-2020 season’s normal matches (p > 0.1).
• There is significant difference in home advantage between the normal matches and the
closed matches ( p < 10−3 ). The significant difference is more obvious between the past
and the closed matches (p < 10−6). The median of the home advantage in the closed
matches is clearly smaller.
Therefore, this study provides strong quantitative evidence of the impact of the crowd effect
on home advantage in the top leagues in Europe. It should be noted that, however, all of the
closed matches in this season have been with several months’ suspension, and held in summer
when the matches have not normally been played. It can not be rejected the possible effect by
these factors.

ii.1 Detailed analysis for each league
The last section described the results for all five leagues. In this section, the estimation results
will be explained for each league. Table 4 lists the detailed test results of Wilcoxon’s rank sum
test for each league. Figure 4 show the number of home matches in the closed period. The teams
are ordered by the final standings. Figures from 5 to 9 show the estimated value of r homeAdv for
each league from 2010-11 season.
England In England, the home advantage value in the closed period obtained by the propose
method has no significant difference to those of in the past and normal periods. This result
shows that the basic stats, such as the goals difference and the win ratio difference shown in
Figure 2, are smaller in the closed period because of the unbalanced schedule. In other words,
the most of the home teams are consistently weak (or strong) in the closed matches. Figure 4
supports this assertion. In England, there are weak correlation between the number of home
matches in the closed period and the final standings. The correlation value is 0.4052. In the
other leagues, Germany, Italy, and Spain, the correlation values are much smaller (0.2863, 0.0867,
and −0.1561).
France In France, there is not significant difference of r homeAdv between past and normal periods.
Germany In Germany, the home advantage value in the closed period has significant difference
to those of in the past and normal periods. Both p−values are less than 1.00 × 10−2 . In the
closed period, Bundesliga showed home “dis”advantage, i.e., r homeAdv < 0.

Italy In Italy, the home advantage value in the closed period has significant difference to that of
in the past periods ( p < 0.01).
Spain In Spain, the home advantage value in the closed period has significant difference to
those of in the past and normal periods. Both p−values are less than 1.00 × 10−2. In the closed
period, similar to Bundesliga, laLiga showed home disadvantage in the closed period.

IV. Conclusion
In this paper, the results of matches behind closed door held under the influence of the
COVID-19 pandemic are used to determine the relationship between the presence of spectators
and home advantage. In order to reduce the effect of schedule unbalance in the closed period,
this paper proposed a short-term (e.g., five matchweeks) rating method considering home
advantage. The proposed method has been applied to the match results in five major European
football leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) from 2010-2011 to 2019-2020
seasons.
The distributions of the home advantage for both the past normal and the closed periods are
calculated. Their median values are compared by using statistical hypothesis test. A null
hypothesis, “the home advantage r̄homeAdv from two different periods are samples from
continuous distributions with equal medians” are rejected with sufficiently small p−value
(p < 10−3). The home advantage became smaller behind the closed door.
Our future work is to extend the proposed method to the match results all over the world. This
work could clarify the crowd effect to home advantage.
