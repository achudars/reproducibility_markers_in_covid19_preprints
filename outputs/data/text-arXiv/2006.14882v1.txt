ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 outbreak has dramatically changed travel behavior
in affected cities. The C2SMART research team has been investigating the impact of COVID-19 on mobility and sociability. New
York City (NYC) and Seattle, two of the cities most affected by
COVID-19 in the U.S. were included in our initial study. An all-inone dashboard with data mining and cloud computing capabilities
was developed for interactive data analytics and visualization to
facilitate the understanding of the impact of the outbreak and corresponding policies such as social distancing on transportation
systems. This platform is updated regularly and continues to evolve
with the addition of new data, impact metrics, and visualizations
to assist public and decision-makers to make informed decisions.
This paper presents the architecture of the COVID related mobility
data dashboard and preliminary mobility and sociability metrics
for NYC and Seattle.

INTRODUCTION

The novel Coronavirus COVID-19 spreading rapidly throughout
the world was recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO)
as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [15]. As of May 17, confirmed
coronavirus cases in the U.S. surpassed 1,400,000, and New York has
the highest number of confirmed cases (348,232 confirmed cases
as of May 15) in the country [13]. The COVID-19 pandemic and
ensuing social distancing orders have had dramatic impacts on
the use of every mode of transportation. With little information
on similar historic pandemics, collection of perishable mobility,
safety, and behavior data related to COVID-19 and learning from
the collected data becomes the key for decision-makers.
C2SMART researchers have developed an interactive data dashboard (http://c2smart.engineering.nyu.edu/covid-19-dashboard/)
that consolidates multiple public data sources listed in Table 1, to
investigate changes in mobility and sociability patterns.
The main objective of this paper is to introduce the developed
platform based on the analysis of data obtained in NYC and Seattle.
Time lag between different cities may offer some insights into how
travel patterns evolve in the context of COVID-19.

PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE

Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of the tool. The core of the
platform resides on cloud computing that provides a reliable infrastructure for solid performance on large scale data processing
and analysis. The ingestion instances inside the platform consume
the raw data stream and evaluate it based on data accuracy, timeliness, validity and granularity. Once the evaluation is completed,
the outcome data will be dispatched to the internal data warehouse
for further analysis. The data dashboard is capable of performing
real-time data analytics and visualization.

fatalities and speeding tickets. Scenario analysis can be performed
directly to these metrics in time series or with spatiotemporal aggregations. The sociability board presents average and maximum
intersection crowd density, bike and pedestrian counts related to
open streets and pedestrian social distancing compliance rates based
on information extracted from real-time traffic cameras. The tool
also connects to C2SMARTâĂŹs MATSim agent-based simulation
virtual testbed [4] that provides network performance and emission
evaluation for reopening phases.

MOBILITY BOARD

The section illustrates some results offered by the mobility board.

3.1

New York City

The closing of essential businesses and stay-at-home policies caused
an immediate direct impact on transportation. Data shows steep
declines in both transit ridership and vehicular traffic. Travel time
on corridor 495 that connects Long Island and New Jersey (NJ)
via Queens and Manhattan in NYC was analyzed in Figure 2 [12]
[8]. A flatter travel time pattern of near free-flow speeds was observed following the stay-at-home orders, instead of typical spikes
of commuter peaks. Increased traffic volume and travel time were
observed in the week of May 4, indicating the start of the recovery
period for NYC.

Figure 2: Hourly Travel Time on 495 Corridor (Flushing
Meadows Corona Park to NJ Turnpike Exit 16E)

Figure 1: Data Dashboard Architecture
The dashboard contains two main sub-boards: (a) mobility board
and (b) sociability board. The mobility board presents multi-data
views in terms of vehicular traffic volume, corridor travel time, transit ridership, freight traffic by gross vehicle weight (GVW), as well
as risk indicators in terms of reported crashes, pedestrian and cyclist

An increase in traffic speed and school zone speeding tickets
was observed with some city streets operating at or near free-flow
speed during the pandemic. For example, on April 15, during the
traditional morning peak hour, 8.3% of the 145 local road segments
where data is available, had an average traffic speed over the city
speed limit of 25 mph in morning peak hour. 28% of them were over
20mph, while only 3.4% had an average traffic speed over 20mph in
February prior to the pandemic.
More mobility metrics for NYC are summarized in Table 2 and
notable changes have been seen. For example, crashes remain low
but the severity of crashes measured by fatalities is up. This may
possibly be due to higher vehicular speeds, but more data is needed

for further investigation. Bikeshare ridership remains down with
the exception of the first 12 days of March. Ridership patterns
did change, with 15% fewer Friday and Saturday trips and a 20%
increase in average trip duration in March 2020 compared to the
same month last year. If not specified, the percentage shown in the
table compares the data in 2020 with 2019.

3.2

Seattle

The greater Seattle area is the first epicenter of the COVID-19
outbreak in U.S., as it reported the first confirmed case in late
January. Washington state, in particular the greater Seattle area,
therefore responded very early to set up guidelines and executive
orders of social distancing to slow down the spread of the novel
coronavirus.
Travel time data for a segment on Interstate-5 were collected via
Google Directions API [6] and analyzed to investigate the trends
on corridor travel time. Travel time started to decrease since early
March and reached the lowest level (near free-flow travel time)
since early April. It remained low for the entire April and began to
increase in early May.
The critical date analysis in Figure 3 demonstrated that the typical spikes of commute peaks disappeared since the release of stayat-home order on March 23, 2020, indicating most people reacted
immediately to the order. Due to less traffic, the reliability of travel
time became higher: the standard deviation of daytime travel time
of the corridor reduced to 0.67 minutes in late April compared with
6.43 minutes in late February.

March 30, and gradually increased to -41.95%, -35.50%, and -26.31%
in the weeks of April 13, 27, and May 11, respectively. Similar trends
have been observed for the other two stations. The continuous increasing trend of traffic volume indicates that the impact of traffic
in Seattle is slowly returning to pre-pandemic despite stay-at-home
restrictions remaining in place. On the other hand, public transit
demand [2] remained low since late March and has not started to
recover yet. Mobility metrics for Seattle are shown in Table 3.

4 SOCIABILITY BOARD
4.1 New York City
Although social distancing orders are announced, it remains unclear how people are responding to these policies. Understanding
the actual reduction in social contact and actual compliance rate is
important to measuring the effectiveness of the policy. Therefore,
311 complaints and real-time camera videos are used to examine
the compliance of social distancing policies. An increase in social
distancing complaints has made the Non-emergency police matter
category the 2nd most common complaint among NYC311 reports.
In addition, the real-time social distancing behavior has been exampled with the analysis of video data. Figure 4 presents the video
processing and data analysis process. Applying object detection
to real-time traffic camera videos [16] [17] with a frame rate of
30 seconds at multiple key locations in different zones within the
city provides additional information about crowd density [9]. One
of the state-of-the-art algorithms, RetinaNet [10], and ResNet-50
[7] are used as the backbone network architecture. The model was
pre-trained using the COCO data set [11]. The open-source platforms TensorFlow [1] and Keras [5] are utilized as the machine
learning library’s support, along with OpenCV [3] for basic video
processing.
To calculate the social distancing compliance rate, the centroids
of detected pedestriansâĂŹ bounding box are identified and the
distance between the centroids are calculated [14]. Next, the ratio
of real height and pixel height (R-P ratio) are computed to project
the real distance by assuming every person has the same heights
(1.70 meters/5.58 feet is used in this study). Traffic-related objects
(person, car, truck, bicycle, bus) and the total number of violated social distancing pairs are reported for each frame. Figure 5 presents
an example of the video processing output. The program was run
on an instance which was configured with Intel Xeon processors
up to 3.1GHz and 16GiB of memory. The GPU is Nvidia Tesla M60.
The running time is around 0.94 sec/frame without real-time visualization and 1.06 second/frame with visualization. The sociability
metrics for NYC is summarized in Table 4.

Figure 3: Critical Day Demonstration for I-5 Travel Time
Traffic volumes at three freeways locations (I-5 downtown Seattle near Freeway Park, I-5 NE of Green Lake Park, and SR-520 toll
bridge) showed a consistent drop in traffic volume in March, followed by a gradual slow increase in April. Using the same week
of previous year as a baseline, traffic volume at the I-5 Downtown
Seattle station dropped to its lowest level -46.91% in the week of

Seattle

Biking and walking for recreational purposes become more popular
than ever in Seattle during the pandemic. Data from SDOT bike and
pedestrian counters show that these activities dramatically changed
during the COVID-19 outbreak period. At Fremont Bridge, a critical
commuting connector between North Seattle and downtown Seattle,
higher bike counts (+3,500) were observed on weekdays while fewer
counts ( 1,000) on weekends in February. Bike counts reduced to the
lowest level in mid-March, but grew back to nearly 2,500, without a

The daily pedestrian pattern of Burke Gilman Trail, a 27-mile
multi-use trail was also investigated. From mid-March, the daily
pedestrian counts almost doubled compared with the period of prepandemic and such immediate shift reflected the impact of social
distancing rules announced in mid-March. Since small businesses,
recreational and commercial facilities were closed, people switched
to public or community trails for recreational purposes. The statistics for bike/pedestrian counts are summarized in Table 5. The

pedestrian counts increased over 50% in April compared with the
same period in 2019.
Similar to NYC, the social distancing violation detection algorithm was implemented for a local street intersection (Broadway &
E Pike St EW) in Seattle with a frame rate of 30 seconds. Results on
May 18 show an average pedestrian density of 3.2 people/frame, a
maximum pedestrian density of 12 people/frame, and a pedestrian
social distancing compliance rate of 89%. More camera data will be
collected and enlarge the coverage of social distancing compliance
detection.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

This paper introduces an interactive data dashboard developed by
C2SMART researchers for COVID-19 analysis. An integrated database that fuses information from multiple data sources including
traditional traffic detectors, crowdsourcing applications, probe vehicles, real-time traffic cameras, and police and hotline reports for
NYC and Seattle was build. The platform is based on cloud computing and data mining techniques for data acquisition and processing
and supports interactive data visualization and data analytics for
quantifying multiple mobility and sociability metrics. It serves as
an all-in-one data fusion tool for open data that is not easy to find
in a single place and is highly scalable that can be extended to other
cities.
As of the first week of May, data from both NYC and Seattle
shows that auto traffic volumes began to rise even when the stayat-home restrictions were still in place. Moreover, while vehicular
traffic volume has started to increase, transit usage remains low
indicating a potential shift in mode choice and increased preference
for non-public modes of travel, at least in the near future. The crowd
density and social distancing compliance for pedestrians based on
data obtained from publicly available DOT cameras using state-ofthe-art video processing techniques can provide useful insights into
daily pedestrian and cyclist demands and their behavior in terms
of maintaining social distance.
Through this interactive data dashboard, we are hoping to provide researchers, transportation authorities, and the general public
with information they can use to track the impact of the outbreak on
our transportation systems and thus to support them to make more
effective data-driven decisions. The current dashboard contains
data from NYC, Seattle, Chicago and six cities from China and will
eventually expand to cover more cities worldwide. As the world
continues to adjust to the new reality of COVID-19, C2SMART
researchers are continuing to collect data, including perishable mobility, safety, and behavior data, and will continue to monitor these
trends and regularly update findings for different reopening stages.
In the future, the integrated database will be further utilized for predictive analysis to assist developing effective actionable strategies
to plan for potential future scenarios.
