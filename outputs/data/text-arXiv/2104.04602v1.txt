Abstract. We show how the standard field theoretical language based on creation
and annihilation operators may be used for a straightforward derivation of an SIR-type
stochastic model for COVID-19 epidemic, from which we obtain the time evolution
of the mean number of infectious (active cases) and deceased individuals. In order
to capture the effects of lockdown and social distancing, we use a time-dependent
infection rate. The results are in good agreement with the data for three different
waves of epidemic activity in South Korea.

1. Introduction
The year 2020 will be remembered in history as the year in which humanity suffered
from the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible for the worst
pandemic in the last hundred years. Governments around the world were strongly
impacted by the pandemic and, in addition to efforts of a social and economic nature,
it became evident the need to bring together members of the international scientific
community to analyze data on the evolution of the disease and propose concrete actions
for the control and mitigation of its serious effects [1]. In this sense, even researchers
from areas far from epidemiology were encouraged to collaborate with their experience
and specific knowledge in the study of possible models for describing the evolution of
the pandemic in different countries of the world [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], often serving as guides

for the actions of local governments. Theoretical particle physicists are used to dealing
with problems and proposing models to describe complex phenomena involving the
fundamental constituents of matter. In this work, we show how the usual field theoretical
language based on creation and annihilation operators, usually used in the construction
of these elementary particle models, may also be adapted to the construction of an
epidemiological model for COVID-19 which can be compared to the data available for
several countries. We believe this can serve as an stimulus so that other researchers
working on these subjects can also contribute to this great scientific network.
In a pioneering work [7] it was shown that creation and annihilation operators
(building blocks of the second quantization method and standard field theoretical
language) are not limited to quantum systems and, in fact, may be introduced to
the description of certain classical many-particle systems. Since then, this Fock space
formalism (or field theoretical language) for classical systems was complemented by a
path integral version and applied to the description of stochastic (birth-death) processes
on lattices [8, 9] and tumour growth [10].
In what follows we show how this standard field theoretical language based on
creation and annihilation operators may be used for a straightforward derivation of
an SIR-type stochastic model for COVID-19 epidemic, from which we obtain the time
evolution of the mean number of infectious (active cases) and deceased individuals in
South Korea. Indeed, our main motivation comes from the fact that, as remarked
in [11], for the types of models studied in population biology and epidemiology, this
field theoretical description is notationally neater and more manageable than standard
methods, often replacing sets of equations by single equations with the same content.
As an example of this, we may stress that a single Hamiltonian function sums up the
system dynamics compactly and may be easily written down from a verbal description
of the transitions presented in our model. Besides the simplicity and notational appeal,
we may stress as another advantage of our SIR-type model the use of a time-dependent
infection rate in order to capture the effects of a lockdown, since the standard SIR model
does not take these into account.
The rest of this work is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the basic
aspects of our model which allow us to obtain differential equations describing the
time evolution of the mean number of infectious and deceased individuals, while the
time-dependent infection rate used for data comparison is presented in Section 3. The
differential equations are used to fit available data (South Korea) for the time evolution
of infectious (active cases) individuals in Section 4 and deceased individuals in Section
5. Further data comparisons for two other distinct waves of epidemic activity in South
Korea are presented in Section 6. Our conclusions are presented in Section 7.
2. Building the model
We start by considering interacting populations, whose total sizes are allowed to change,
composed of four types of individuals: susceptible, infectious, recovered and deceased.

Second quantization approach to COVID-19 epidemic

Let us introduce S(t), I(t), R(t) and D(t) as random variables which represent,
respectively, the number of susceptible, infectious, recovered and deceased individuals
at a given time instant t.
We then consider a multivariate process {(S(t); I(t); R(t); D(t))}∞
t=0 with a joint
probability function given by
p(nS ,nI ,nR ,nD ) (t) = Prob{S(t) = nS ; I(t) = nI ; R(t) = nR ; D(t) = nD } .

(1)

Our aim is to compute time-dependent expectation values of the observables S(t),
I(t), R(t) and D(t), which may be defined in terms of the configuration probability
according to
hS(t)i =

X

nS p(nS ,nI ,nR ,nD ) (t) ;

nS ,nI ,nR ,nD

hI(t)i =

X

nI p(nS ,nI ,nR ,nD ) (t) ;

nS ,nI ,nR ,nD

hR(t)i =

X

nR p(nS ,nI ,nR ,nD ) (t) ;

nS ,nI ,nR ,nD

hD(t)i =

X

nD p(nS ,nI ,nR ,nD ) (t) .

(2)

nS ,nI ,nR ,nD

The probabilistic state of the system may be represented by the vector
|νS , νI , νR , νD it =

X

p(nS ,nI ,nR ,nD ) (t) |nS , nI , nR , nD i ,

(3)

nS ,nI ,nR ,nD

P
with the normalization condition nS ,nI ,nR ,nD p(nS ,nI ,nR ,nD ) (t) = 1.
Since the configurations are given entirely in terms of occupation numbers
(nS , nI , nR , nD ), which calls for a representation in terms of second-quantized bosonic
operators [9], we introduce creation and annihilation operators for the susceptible,
infectious, recovered and deceased individuals, respectively, aS and a†S , aI and a†I , aR
and a†R , aD and a†D .
These operators must satisfy the following commutation relations
h

i
ai , a†j = δij ;
h

†
†
[ai , aj ] = ai , aj = 0 ,

(4)

where i, j = {S, I, R, D} and δij is the Kronecker delta (δij = 1 if i = j and
δij = 0 if i 6= j). As usual in the second quantization framework, we say

that a†S , a†I , a†R and a†D “create” , respectively, susceptible, infectious, recovered
and deceased individuals when applied over the reference (vacuum) state |0, 0, 0, 0i.

This vacuum state has the following properties: aS |0, 0, 0, 0i = aI |0, 0, 0, 0i =
aR |0, 0, 0, 0i = aD |0, 0, 0, 0i = 0 (from which “annihilation” operators) and
h0, 0, 0, 0|0, 0, 0, 0i = 1 (inner product).
Following the above definitions, we also have
a†S |nS , nI , nR , nD i = |nS + 1, nI , nR , nD i ;
a†I |nS , nI , nR , nD i = |nS , nI + 1, nR , nD i ;
a†R |nS , nI , nR , nD i = |nS , nI , nR + 1, nD i ;
a†D |nS , nI , nR , nD i = |nS , nI , nR , nD + 1i ;
aS |nS , nI , nR , nD i = nS |nS − 1, nI , nR , nD i ;
aI |nS , nI , nR , nD i = nI |nS , nI − 1, nR , nD i ;
aR |nS , nI , nR , nD i = nR |nS , nI , nR − 1, nD i ;
aD |nS , nI , nR , nD i = nD |nS , nI , nR , nD − 1i .

(5)
Since
a†S aS |nS , nI , nR , nD i = nS |nS , nI , nR , nD i ;
a†I aI |nS , nI , nR , nD i = nI |nS , nI , nR , nD i ;
a†R aR |nS , nI , nR , nD i = nR |nS , nI , nR , nD i ;
a†D aD |nS , nI , nR , nD i = nD |nS , nI , nR , nD i ,
(6)
we may conclude that the operators nS = a†S aS , nI = a†I aI , nR = a†R aR and nD = a†D aD
just count the number of individuals in a definite state, reason why they are called
number operators. Note that the vector state of our system may be then rewritten in
terms of creation and annihilation operators as
|νS , νI , νR , νD it =

The time evolution of our system will then be generated by a linear operator H
(Hamiltonian) which may be constructed directly from the the transition rates present

Figure 1. The structure of our SIR-type model. The rate β is related to the infection
rate of the virus and γ is related to the time required to infected people to become
recovered or deceased. Both parameters have the dimension of time−1 . Indeed,
γ = 1/D, where D is the average time period during which an individual remains
infectious, before one gets recovered or deceased. The parameter σ (the case fatality
rate) is dimensionless and represents the percentage of infected people who become
deceased.

compartmental diagram for the structure of our SIR-type model.
Note that, upon summing up the terms presented in Table 1 and rearranging them,
we may write down our Hamiltonian as

The notational advantage of this field theoretical description is made clear at this
point if we observe that, from the above definitions, the equation which represents the
flux of probability between states at rates defined by our model (the so-called master
equation or forward Kolmogorov differential equation [12]) takes the very compact form
of an imaginary-time Schrödinger-type linear equation, namely
d
|νS , νI , νR , νD it = −H |νS , νI , νR , νD it .
dt

(9)

We can get, after some algebra, a more common representation for the master
equation by substituting the expressions for the Hamiltonian, (8), and the vector state,
(3), into (9)

+ σγ(nI + 1) p(nS ,nI +1,nR ,nD −1) (t) .

(10)

In order to compute the time-dependent expectation values of the observables S(t),
I(t), R(t) and D(t) through the above master equation, we follow the well-established
methodology presented in [12] and introduce the following moment generating function
(mgf )
M (φS , φI , φR , φD ; t) = eφS S(t) eφI I(t) eφR R(t) eφD D(t)

Last but not least, we must observe at this point that the above differential equations
would be the same if we have considered time-dependent rates (β(t),γ(t)) from the very
beginning. This turns out to be an important aspect of our model as we shall see in the
next section.
3. Comparison to COVID-19 Epidemic Data - South Korea
We now compare our model against public epidemic data from South Korea, which was
taken from the “Worldometer” reference website [13]. The modeled data for the number
of deaths and number of active cases was compared to the data reported in South Korea
during 96 days of the epidemic. In order to take into account the slowdown of the spread
due the effects of quarantine and social distancing we use a similar approach to [14],
where the infection rate β is a function of time (β ≡ β(t)). Specifically, β(t) = β0 before
a time tth , while it exponentially decays for t > tth . In our approach, however, we treat
the period prior to lockdown and social actions with a a linearly growing β(t) function,
instead of a constant, i.e.:
β(t) = β0 t for 0 ≤ t < tth ,

(15)

and due to function continuity the expression for β(t) after lockdown measures becomes:
β(t) = tth β0 e−(t−tth )/τ

for t ≥ tth ,

(16)

where the time tth represents the starting time of the quarantine actions, while τ refers
to the decaying period and it has the dimension of time.

Figure 2. Number of active cases of COVID-19 in South Korea during 96 days of
the epidemic corresponding to first wave of infections in the country. Modeled data is
shown by the continuous red line, while measured data is depicted by the blue points.

4. Number of active cases
For the number of active cases, we perform a weighted fit of the model allowing four of
the five free parameters to vary (the number of active cases is independent of σ, the case
fatality rate, discussed in Section 5) using least squares minimization with the LMFIT
[15] package in Python 3.6.8. We use a population size of N = 5.164 × 107 people and
as initial condition we use 19 active cases, the number of registered cases on the 18th of
February in South Korea according to the Worldometer database. The end date of this
first wave of infections is set to May 23, 2020.
The resulting fit, obtained by solving (14) for hI(t)i, overlaid with the real data
points is shown in Figure 2. We also obtain the mean absolute percentage error (M )
of the real data and the fitted data points and achieve M = 14.7%, which indicates
acceptable agreement.
4.1. Fitted parameters
The best fit is given by the following set of parameters:
β0 = 1.898 × 10−6 ± 1.202 × 10−7

,

γ = 0.0710 ± 0.0127 ,

tth = 10.008 ± 0.868

,

τ = 19.010 ± 3.029 ,

Second quantization approach to COVID-19 epidemic

where the estimated uncertainties, calculated by LMFIT, are done by inverting the
Hessian matrix, which represents the second derivative of fit quality for each variable
parameter. It is interesting to note that 1/γ, the time required to infected people to
become recovered or deceased, is estimated to be 1/0.017 ∼ 14 days. The uncertainty
on this value is, however, large (18%), but even the shortest (12 days) and longest (17
days) values are within acceptable ranges for the average duration of the disease [16].
The β0 parameter, which is the initial constant for the infection rate, is a small number,
which is unsurprising given that we have considered the infection rate to grow linearly
with time until lockdown measures are in place. The value of tth is interpreted as the
day lockdown and social distancing measures started in South Korea during the first
wave of infections.
5. Case fatality rate
The case fatality rate (σ) in South Korea between February 18 and May 23, 2020 was
obtained from the number of registered deaths. Figure 3 shows the modeled data (red),
the solution for hD(t)i in (14), overlaid with the measured data (blue), and reasonable
agreement can be seen between them. The best fit of the measured data to our model
is given by:
σ = 0.0109 ± 0.0011 ,
which corresponds to a rate of ∼ 1.1%.
6. Second and third outbreaks in South Korea
South Korea has experienced three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, as can be seen
on Figure 4, which shows the total number of active cases as a function of time (days)
using data taken from the Worldometer reference website. As our model was able to
reasonably model the first wave of infections, it is worth checking its explanatory power
during the second and third COVID-19 waves for the same country. There is no strict
definition for what an epidemic wave is, with the term simply implying natural pattern
of peaks and valleys of contaminated individuals. Thus, we define the second wave
between August 10, 20120 and October 1st 2020 and fit the data to our model using
the same approach as for the first wave. The result for the second wave can be seen on
Figure 5, with the best fit given by the following set of parameters:
β0 = 7.666 × 10−7 ± 2.086 × 10−8

,

γ = 0.0741 ± 4.110 × 10−5 ,

tth = 15.653 ± 0.388

,

τ = 12.589 ± 0.643 .

data is shown by the continuous red line, while measured data is depicted by the blue

Figure 5. Number of active cases of COVID-19 in South Korea during 53 days of the
epidemic corresponding to the so-called second wave of infections. Modeled data is
shown by the continuous red line, while measured data is depicted by the blue points.

The mean absolute percentage error for the fit is of 5%, which points to an even
better agreement compared to the first wave, a fact that is partially explained by the
better available statistics. It must also be noted that the end of the second wave
of infections quite rapidly became the start of the third wave, reason the data was
truncated already on October 1st, i.e., 16 no longer holds, after around that date. The
good agreement during the expanding phase, followed by a worse agreement during the
decay phase seen in Figure 5 can be partially attributed to it.
Figure 6 shows the result for the third epidemic wave in South Korea, between
November 06 2020 and February 06 2021. The β0 parameter is of the same order of
magnitude as for the second wave and there is also similar agreement, with a mean
absolute percentage error of 5.7%.
7. Concluding Remarks
We have investigated, using an SIR-type stochastic model for COVID-19 epidemic as a
fundamental tool, the time evolution of the mean number of infectious (active cases) and
deceased individuals in South Korea. Our model was able to describe the available data
successfully. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first COVID-19 model built from
standard field theoretical language. Despite its simplicity, the model was able to describe
three waves of infections of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, which shows its
robustness and versatility. Studies including a non-susceptible subset of the population
due to vaccinations and its effect on the infection rates, as well as comparisons with
