THE ROLE OF SWABS IN MODELING THE COVID-19
OUTBREAK IN THE MOST AFFECTED REGIONS OF
ITALY

University of Padova, Italy
The daily fluctuations in the released number of Covid-19 cases
played a big role both at the beginning and in the most critical weeks
of the outbreak, when local authorities in Italy had to decide whether
to impose a lockdown and at which level. Public opinion was focused
on this information as well, to understand how quickly the epidemic
was spreading. When an increase/decrease was communicated, especially a large one, it was not easy to understand if it was due to a
change in the epidemic evolution or if it was a fluctuation due to
other reasons, such as an increase in the number of swabs or a delay
in the swab processing.
In this work, we propose a nonlinear asymmetric diffusion model,
which includes information on the daily number of swabs, to describe
daily fluctuations in the number of confirmed cases in addition to the
main trend of the outbreak evolution. The class of diffusion models
has been selected to develop our proposal, as it also allows estimation
of the total number of confirmed cases at the end of the outbreak.
The proposed model is compared to six existing models, among
which the logistic and the SIRD models are used as benchmarks, in
the five most affected Italian regions.

1. Introduction. Italy was the first nation to be affected by Covid-19
after China, and the epidemic has mainly been located in Nothern Italy.
The first case was detected on February 21st, 2020, in the municipality of
Vo’, a village near Padua in the Veneto Region of Northeast Italy. On the
same day, an infected patient was detected in the small town of Codogno,
which is located in the bordering Lombardy region. From that time on, the
epidemic followed a completely different evolution in the two regions, and it
quickly spread in northern Italy.
In Veneto, the local authorities imposed a lockdown on the whole municipality for two weeks; both at the beginning and at the end of the two weeks,
the population was tested for the virus through nasopharyngeal swabs, and
this approach gave rise to the first epidemiological survey on Covid-19 for
understanding its transmission dynamics (Lavezzo et al., 2020). Moreover,

the hospital where the first diagnosis occurred was closed, and people who
had previously accessed the facility were tested.
Among the Italian regions, Lombardy is the most affected by the epidemic, with a death toll three times greater than that in China (Indolfi and
Spaccarotella, 2020). It is apparent that, in Italy, the regional autonomy
regarding health policy has resulted in services with different levels of quality (Indolfi and Spaccarotella, 2020), such as the number of beds and the
capacity of processing swabs. With regard to the number of beds in Italy,
the forecasts of hospitalisations was faced by Gregori et al. (2020) for the
Veneto region, while Farcomeni et al. (2020) modeled the intensive care unit
occupancy.
The capacity of processing swabs is of particular importance for detecting the state of the epidemic, measuring the lockdown effects and, most
importantly, reducing the outbreak. In fact, only a swab outcome enacts the
procedure to eventually isolate the infected individual together with his/her
close contacts. Consistent delays in this process will lead to failure in controlling the outbreak. Moreover, public attention is focused every day on
the released number of confirmed cases as a measure of the state of the epidemic, especially at the beginning of the outbreak and during the lockdown
to evaluate its effect. When an increase/decrease is communicated, especially
a large one, it is not easy to understand if it is due to a change in the epidemic evolution or if it is a fluctuation due to other reasons, such as delays
in the swab process or in the laboratory organization. The effect, however, is
relevant both to public opinion, spreading inaccurate optimistic/pessimistic
views of the situation, and to authorities who must decide whether to adopt
restrictions and at which level.
Our opinion is that it is necessary to include the number of swabs to describe the local fluctuations in the epidemic evolution in addition to detecting the main trend. To the best of our knowledge, no models are present in
literature with this characteristic. In fact, at the beginning of the outbreak,
the curve of confirmed cases was usually modeled through an exponential
(Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020) or a logistic growth model (Batista, 2020b;
Shen, 2020). When the data collection window became long enough, the
models were usually of two types: the compartmental and ARIMA models.
The compartmental models represent the more blooming field of research
and are based on modeling the infection, recovery and mortality rates by
using the times series of the actually positive, recovered and dead cases
(Anastassopoulou et al., 2020; Batista, 2020a; Caccavo, 2020; Fanelli and
Piazza, 2020; Ivorra et al., 2020; Iwata and Miyakoshi, 2020; Lavezzo et al.,
2020; Liu et al., 2020; Postnikov, 2020; Wangping et al., 2020). In the field

3

of spatial statistics, Guliyev (2020) contributed a spatial panel data model
on confirmed, recovered and dead cases. Meanwhile, Benvenuto et al. (2020)
and Chintalapudi, Battineni and Amenta (2020) represent two contributions
based on an ARIMA model.
In this paper, we made an effort to describe the cumulative number of
confirmed cases in the five most affected Italian regions, based on the combination of a nonlinear model and the number of completed swabs. In the
class of growth models, we propose a new version of the dynamic potential
model (Guseo and Guidolin, 2009), where the novelty consists of the formulation of a new intervention function with the number of daily swabs as
an explanatory variable. The model is particularly parsimonious since the
intervention function has only one additional parameter. The base of the dynamic potential model was chosen since a) it has an asymmetric shape and
makes it possible to model a ‘saddle’, which is a rather common nonlinear
pattern; b) it gives an estimate of the total number of confirmed cases at the
end of the epidemic; and c) the total number of confirmed cases is not fixed
throughout the outbreak, but it is allowed to change over time. Since the
capability of processing swabs increased over time and, consequently, the
meeting criteria for people for being tested were enlarged with the aim of
detecting a larger number of asymptomatic positive subjects, it is sensible
to suppose that the number of diagnosed cases increases with time.
The proposed model was compared, in each region, with five alternative
growth models: the logistic model was used as a benchmark; the Generalized
Bass model (Bass, Krishnan and Jain, 1994), eventually including a parameter accounting for asymmetry (Bemmaor, 1994), with fixed market potential;
and the classic dynamic potential model (Guseo and Guidolin, 2009), eventually including a seasonal component (Guidolin and Guseo, 2014), Moreover,
a SIRD model was used as a second benchmark by summing the predictions of actually positive, recovered and dead cases. Three-week forecasts of
the spreading dynamics were provided for each model as well. The models
were compared in terms of R2 and BIC values, for the cumulative values.
The squared linear correlation coefficient between observed and fitted daily
values was evaluated as well.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: In Section 2, we provide a description of the available data. In Section 3, we describe the proposed model
and the 6 competing models. The results obtained in the 5 Italian regions
are illustrated in Section 4. Some concluding remarks follow in Section 5.
2. Data. The data of the five Italian regions most affected by the epidemic, namely Veneto, Lombardy, Piedmont, Tuscany and Emilia–Romagna,

4

were downloaded from the Civil Protection Department website - Presidency
of the Council of Ministers (2020). The data collection period was from the
24th of February to the 3rd of May 2020, which is the last day before the
so–called Phase 2, when the lockdown was partially removed. For each day,
the data consist of currently infected patients, both hospitalised or home
isolated, cumulated recovered people, cumulated deaths, the total number
of confirmed cases, which is given by the sum of the latter three components,
and the cumulative number of swabs.
Official data before the 24th of February are not available, but the first
infected people were detected on the 21st of February in both Veneto and
Lombardy. Since the first days are important to correctly estimate the spread
of an epidemic, for the latter regions we integrated the official dataset with
information released by the newspapers and/or the official websites of the
Regions about cases for the 21st to 23rd of February.
The reconstruction of the number of swabs in Lombardy for the first three
days was facilitated by the Region press release on the 21st of February
(Regione Lombardia, 2020) and by the news article of L’eco di Bergamo
(2020) on the 23rd; the value of the 22nd was imputed through their mean.
For the Veneto region, the imputation was subjectively fixed at 200, 700
and 1500 for days 21–23, respectively. Moreover, the swab time series were
cleaned since the cumulative values were not nondecreasing. This happened
on the 25th of February for Lombardy, and the imputation was made by the
average of the former and latter values. For Emilia-Romagna, there was an
analogous problem for the 28th to 30th of March, and the imputation was
performed based on the information released in Regione Emilia-Romagna
(2020); ModenaToday (2020).
Figure 1 shows the daily number of confirmed cases in the five regions.
The diffusion process peaked around the second half of March in the regions
where the epidemic started: Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna. First,
it is worth noting the peculiarity of the epidemic in Lombardy, as the spread
was much greater than in the other regions. What is common is that the
shape of the spread was asymmetric with a faster increase and a much slower
decrease. Piedmont has a different peculiarity, with a rather flat spread in
the second part of April because this region encountered problems with
taking and processing the swabs.
The capability of each region in processing swabs changed over time.
Initially, swabs were essentially performed only on symptomatic patients
and their strict contacts. Some regions, however, quickly increased their
capability to process swabs, and asymptomatic cases could be detected and
isolated as well. Since only people with a positive swab can be officially

Fig 1. Daily number of confirmed Covid–19 cases in the five Italian regions

recorded as infected, and as many infected people do not show symptoms, a
large number of swabs is a prerequisite for diagnosis: the more swabs taken,
the more cases found. The relationship between confirmed cases and the
number of swabs is shown in Figure 4, with daily values. The fluctuations in
the number of confirmed cases depend, to a certain extent, on the number
of swabs processed, and for some regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto and
Tuscany, the data show an almost regular weekly pattern, due perhaps to
the organisation of the laboratories.
Figure 2 depicts, for each region, the number of currently infected, cumulated recovered people and cumulated deaths. Fitted values obtained with
the SIRD model are also plotted (for details, see Section 4).
3. Models. A general diffusion of innovations model can be defined
through a nonlinear regression model as follows:
(1)

y(t) = z(t, ϑ) + ε(t),

where y(t) are the cumulative sales of a product at time t and z(t, ϑ) = z(t)
is a specific structure to be used to describe an evolution process. Here, εt
are assumed to be i.i.d. Gaussian with variance σ 2 . The components of the
parameter vector ϑ are jointly estimated using nonlinear least squares (or,
equivalently, likelihood estimation).

In this paper, we will compare the performance of alternative evolution
structures. The basic model is a logistic one (LOG):
(2)

z(t) = m

e

,

where λ is the mode, median and average of the distribution, while η is a
shape parameter. Parameter m is the market potential, which is the limiting
value for z(t), as t goes to infinity.
The Generalized Bass Model (Bass, Krishnan and Jain, 1994) is defined
starting from the differential equation

z(t)

z (t) = p + q
[m − z(t)]w(t).

Its solution, for the initial condition z(0) = 0, is

,

where m is the market potential, p is the innovation coefficient, q is the
imitation coefficient and w(t) can be any integrable function. The effect
of the intervention function w(t) is to accelerate or decrease diffusion with
respect to a symmetric unimodal path, which would arise in (4) for w(t) = 1
for all t values. For t values such as w(t) > 1 diffusion is accelerated, while
w(t) < 1 corresponds to time periods with decreased diffusion speed. Below,
we examine the model (GBMRECT ) arising when w(t) is specified by the
so-called rectangular shock:
(5)

wR (t) = 1 + cIa≤t≤b .

This allows us to describe the diffusion of a product for which we observe
a constant shock with intensity c, either positive or negative, in the time
interval [a, b] (Guseo and Dalla Valle, 2005).
Due to the asymmetric path observed for almost every region, we also
examine a more flexible model from Bemmaor (1994):
(6)

z(t) = m

1 − e−(p+q)t
,
[1 + pq e−(p+q)t ]A

where A is a further parameter allowing for asymmetry (positive asymmetry
for A > 1, negative asymmetry for A < 1). If we insert a rectangular shock

8

into it, we obtain the following model (BeGBMRECT ):
(7)

z(t) = m

1 − e−(p+q)

Rt

[1 + pq e−(p+q)

wR (τ )dτ

,

with function wR specified as in (5).
A different way to provide flexibility to the evolutive structure can be
obtained through a dynamic market potential model (Guseo and Guidolin,
2009) (DMP):
s
1 − e−(pc +qc )t 1 − e−(p+q)t
,
(8)
z(t) = m
1 + pqcc e−(pc +qc )t 1 + pq e−(p+q)t
where pc and qc are two parameters to describe how fast the dynamic market
potential approaches its maximum value, m.
Additionally, the DMP can be perturbed by shocks. For a general intervention function, w(t), we obtain:
s
Rt
1 − e−(pc +qc )t 1 − e−(p+q) 0 w(τ )dτ
(9)
z(t) = m
.
Rt
1 + pqcc e−(pc +qc )t 1 + q e−(p+q) 0 w(τ )dτ
p

If in model (9) we use, as proposed in Guidolin and Guseo (2014), the
intervention function




(10)
ws (t) = 1 + α1 cos

,

we allow the model to incorporate cyclic seasonal fluctuations of width α1
and α2 with period s (DMPseas).
Here, we propose to assess the usefulness of a dynamic market potential
model as in (9), but with an intervention function depending upon the number of swabs analyzed at day t, B(t) (DMPsw). In particular, we suggest
using


B(t) − µB
(11)
wB (t) = 1 + ξ
,
σB
where µB and σB are the average and the standard deviation, respectively,
of the B(t) values recorded during the observation period. It is easy to
appreciate that such a structure accelerates, with respect to an underlying
trend described by a DMP, the number of cases whenever B(t) exceeds its
average, while cases are reduced with a below-average number of swabs.

A further benchmark is proposed in this work with the SIRD model, a
compartmental model used for describing and predicting the evolution of an
infectious disease. Every individual of the population may flow between the
compartments of ‘Susceptibles’ (S = S(t)), ‘Infected’ (I = I(t)), ‘Recovered’
(R = R(t)) and ‘Deaths’ (D = D(t)). We could apply this model using the
data of currently infected patients (I), cumulated recovered individuals (R)
and cumulated deaths (D). The forecasts of the confirmed cases are then
calculated by summing the forecasts of I, R and D.
This model uses the following system of differential equations:

where N is the population size, while β, γ, and δ are the rates of infection,

first day of the collection period. In this work, I0 and N are estimated to

10

maximize the fitting, as the goal of this work is to describe and predict the
evolution of the total number of confirmed cases. The last initial value to be
defined is S0 = N − I0 − R0 − D0 . The parameter set corresponds to (β, γ,
δ, N , I0 ).
Table 1 proposes a summary of all the models that will be applied in this
study.
4. Applications. Models of Table 1 were applied to the data of the five
considered regions, and forecasts up to May 24th are provided (three weeks
ahead for each region). The first six models were fitted to the cumulative
confirmed cases using NLS estimation; asymptotic standard errors and 95%
asymptotic marginal confidence intervals (mCIs) are provided.
The SIRD model was fitted to I, R and D time series, assuming errors to be
iid normal distributed, and therefore using MLE estimation. R was used with
the bbmle library (Bolker and R Development Core Team, 2020). To ensure
that β, γ, δ estimates lay in (0, 1), the model was reparametrized using
their logit transformations. Moreover, for computational aspects, the natural
logarithms of both N and I0 were used. Standard errors and 95% profile
likelihood mCIs (based on inverting a spline fit to the profile likelihood) are
given. By summing the fitted values of I, R and D, we also obtained the fitted
values of the cumulative confirmed cases: this is used as a benchmark for
evaluating the performance of the proposed models. For each region, Figure
2 depicts the evolution of I, R and D on the right y−axis and of the daily
confirmed cases on the left y−axis; solid lines correspond to fitted values.
Table 2 summarizes the values of the determination index R2 for all models: the huge values of R2 are unsurprising, given that we are working with
cumulative data and any S-shaped fitting produces high determination indexes. A standard approach advises the use of the R2 measure for comparative purposes only (Guseo and Mortarino, 2015; Guseo et al., 2017); we,
therefore, provided also the BIC (evaluated with cumulative values) and the
squared linear correlation coefficient ρ2 between observed and fitted daily
values as well.
4.1. Veneto. The results for Veneto are displayed in Table 2 (R2 , BIC
and ρ2 between observed and fitted daily values), in Tables 3, A.1–A.6 (for
parameter estimates for all the models fitted) and in Figures 2(a) and 3,
where observed and fitted daily values are plotted.
From these results, we can infer that the logistic (Figure 3(a)) and the
SIRD (Figure 2(a)) models, which both represent two commonly used benchmarks, are not adequate to describe the asymmetrical evolution of the epidemic, together with the large fluctuations.

The results in Tables A.2 and A.3 show that a positive (ĉ > 0) rectangular
shock is significantly diagnosed both in the GBMRECT and the BeGBMRECT .
In both cases, the shock denotes an increase in cases starting around March
5th (t ' 14) and March 9th (t ' 18), respectively, and ending around
March 23rd (t ' 32) and March 24th (t ' 33), respectively. Within these
models, the shock has the function of fitting the steep increase in cases
in the first period of the epidemic. Since the data for Veneto start from
February 21st, both shocks end almost exactly two weeks later than the
lockdown, established on March 8th. This confirms that the lockdown policy
was essential in reducing the spread of the epidemics, as the incubation
period is up to 14 days. The BeGBMRECT suggests that the decrease after
the peak is much slower than the initial growth (Â=2.316), and, for this
reason, we expect that the subsequent models, which allow for asymmetry
too, will also have good performance.
The DMP model (Figure 3(d) and Table A.4) summarizes the trend of the
series well, but the R2 and the BIC are slightly worse than the BeGBMRECT .
We also highlight that a good fit with the DMP could not be attained in
the early phase of the outbreak with a smaller number of observations,

while the BeGBMRECT could be correctly identified.
Among asymmetric models, however, only the DMPseas and DMPsw are
able to take into account the fluctuations around the main trend. The performance of the DMPseas is very good (R2 =0.999825, ρ2 =0.834856). However,
the weekly cycle (ŝ = 7.003 days, see Table A.5) in the DMPseas is still partially unsatisfactory because the range of its fluctuations is not sufficiently
large compared to the range of the observations (Figure 3(e)). Moreover,
the high number of parameters in the DMPseas penalizes it in terms of
BIC (689.2245), whose value is larger than the corresponding values for the
BeGBMRECT and DMP.
As highlighted in Section 2, the complete time series with the daily number of processed swabs is available. Figure 4(a) shows its values (right
y−axis) in relation to the number of daily confirmed cases (left y−axis).
We notice the good agreement between the paths of the two series, and the
correspondence of their peaks suggests that this relationship could be exploited. The DMPsw (Figure 3(f) and Table 3) performs very well. In fact,
we obtained the largest values for R2 , 0.999898, and ρ2 , 0.858459, for this
model as well as the lowest BIC value, 641.4728. The latter value, in particular, is reduced by the small number of parameters of this model. Clearly,
the strict comparison between the BIC of this model and the values obtained for the other models should take into account that, in this model,
the complete series of processed daily swabs, B(t), is used as an input to
the model. However, this information is available, and the performance of
the model suggests it is useful for achieving an accurate description. These
results suggest that the daily number of cases in Veneto followed an asymmetric trend, as modelled by a DMP model, but large fluctuations around
that trend can be observed as a consequence of different numbers of swabs
processed each day. We underline that the forecasts displayed in Figure 3(f)
have been obtained assuming that the number of swabs processed in the last
week will be repeated in the subsequent three weeks.

15

With the fitted models, we also obtained the estimate of the total number
of infected people during the whole epidemic: that is, N for the SIRD model
and m for the other models. Both the LOG and the SIRD models, which
are the lower performing models, provided smaller estimates (m̂ = 18270
and N̂ = 17586, respectively). The estimates obtained for m in the remaining models are very similar, ranging from 19432 (GBMRECT ) to 20085
(BeGBMRECT ). In particular, for the DMPsw model, m̂=19932. Notice that
this model predicts 1162 (+6.4%) and 1846 (+10%) more cases than the
LOG and the SIRD models, respectively. Were the lockdown policy of Phase
1 confirmed after May 3rd, the estimate of m given by the DMPsw model
suggests that Veneto experienced, by May 3rd, 92% of all expected cases
(the total number of cases until May 3rd was 18318).
4.2. Lombardy. Lombardy is the Italian region where COVID-19 spread
in the most dramatic way. The total number of infected people on May 3rd
was 77528 with more than 14000 deaths (about half of the death toll up to
that date in Italy as a whole). The results for Lombardy are displayed in
Table 2 (R2 , BIC and ρ2 ), in Tables 4, A.7–A.12 (for parameter estimates
for all the models fitted) and in Figures 2(b) and 5, where observed and
fitted daily values are plotted.
For this region, the logistic (Figure 5(a)) and SIRD (Figure 2(b)) models
are less effective models in describing the asymmetrical evolution of the
epidemic. For the SIRD model, in particular, a good convergence point could
not be attained.
The results in Tables A.8 and A.9 show that, as observed for Veneto, a
positive (ĉ > 0) rectangular shock is significantly diagnosed at the beginning of the time series, both in the GBMRECT and the BeGBMRECT . The
GBMRECT estimates the end of the shock on March 25th (t ' 34), but according to Figure 5(b), this is not perfectly matching with the data. This is
the reason why, for this model, ρ2 is particularly small (0.690817).1 .
Conversely, the BeGBMRECT better identifies the end of the shock three
days later, on March 28th (t ' 37), when we observe a relevant stable decrease. For this region, the lockdown policy had a delayed effect compared
to what happened in Veneto, as the decrease in the number of cases was
registered 20 days after March 8th, while the incubation period is up to 14
days. One reason for such a wider interval could be possible delays in taking
1
The R2 is evaluated on cumulative cases, which are the response variable. Since cumulative cases are measured on a much larger scale, discrepancies between fitted and
observed values are less relevant on the R2 than they are on the daily values. In this case,
the lack-of-fit around the peak heavily penalizes the ρ2 .

and processing the swabs; in fact, the health system of Lombardy experienced an unexpected overload.
With the DMP model (Figure 5(d) and Table A.10), it is possibile to
fully appreciate the asymmetrical shape of the outbreak, especially the slow
decrease in the number of cases in this region. However, its performance in
terms of R2 , ρ2 and BIC is worse than that of the BeGBMRECT .
The performance of the DMPseas, with a weekly cycle (ŝ = 7.005 days)
(Table A.11), is not satisfactory, as it does not adequately capture the fluctuations (except for the very end of the series). Here, too, the R2 , ρ2 and
BIC values are worse than those obtained with the BeGBMRECT .
Finally, the DMPsw (Figure 5(f) and Table 4) performs very well. With
this model, we obtained the largest values for R2 , 0.999919, and ρ2 , 0.902698.
The BIC value for this model, 830.5628, supports it with respect to the
BeGBMRECT (850.6930), which was the best model up to this point. Figure
4(b) shows the number of swabs (right y−axis) in relation to daily cases (left
y−axis). For this region, too, there is a great agreement between the paths
of the two series, with almost perfect correspondence of their peaks. By
comparing panels (a) and (b) of Figure 4, we can appreciate the differences
in swab policies adopted by Veneto and Lombardy. The latter region, which
has about twice the number of inhabitants as Veneto, processed on average
5705 swabs each day, which was not much more than the average in Veneto
(5250), even though Lombardy experienced more than four times the number
of officially diagnosed people compared to Veneto.
The estimates obtained for m in BeGBMRECT , DMP, DMPseas and DMPsw
substantially agree, ranging from 95018 (DMPsw) to 98723 (DMPseas). As
underlined at the beginning of this subsection, the total number of cases until May 3rd was 77528. The difference between this number and m̂=95018 of
the DMPsw is quite large, confirming that this region, by May 3rd, started
Phase 2 in a riskier context than Veneto, having experienced only 82% of
all expected cases.

4.3. Piedmont. Piedmont is the Italian region where the peak in diagnosed cases occurred later (see Figure 1), as, at the beginning of April, one
month after the lockdown, we still observed the highest number of daily
cases. This could be due to the limited swabbing capacity in the first part of
the epidemic, when swabs never exceeded 400 per day (see Figure 4(c)). The
results for Piedmont are displayed in Table 2 (R2 , BIC and ρ2 ), in Tables 5,
A.13–A.18 (for parameter estimates for all the models fitted) and in Figures
2(c) and 6, where observed and fitted daily values are plotted.
Also for this region, the logistic (Figure 6(a)) and SIRD (Figure 2(c))
models are the poorest performing models in terms of describing the asymmetrical evolution of the epidemic.
The results in Tables A.14 and A.15 show that here also a positive (ĉ > 0)
rectangular shock is significantly diagnosed at the beginning of the time
series, both in the GBMRECT and the BeGBMRECT . The two models provide
the same estimate for the end of the shock on March 24th (t ' 30), exactly
as observed for Veneto. However, after the end of shock, the number of daily
cases continued to increase, although at a slower rate (see Figure 6(b) and
(c)).
The DMP model (Figure 6(d) and Table A.16) enables describing, without
shocks, the bimodal behaviour of this time series: the ‘saddle’, which is the
slowdown between two relative peaks, is exactly positioned immediately after
the end of the shocks estimated with the GBMRECT and the BeGBMRECT .
If, on the one hand, the lockdown policy had the effect of reducing the
number of daily cases (saddle after the first peak), on the other hand, the
second peak is due to the increase in the number of swabs after April 8th,
which made it possible to detect more infected people. The DMP for this
region performs very well (R2 =0.99988), with a small BIC value, also due
to the parsimony of a model with only five parameters.
The DMPseas, with a weekly cycle (ŝ = 7.01 days) (Table A.17), describes
the frequency of the fluctuations up to the second half of April, with an
insufficient amplitude throughout the entire observed period. For this region,
however, we observe the largest R2 value among all the previous models,
R2 =0.999895, although the BIC value is larger than that observed for the
simpler DMP.
The DMPsw (Figure 6(f) and Table 5) provides the largest values for R2 ,
0.999905, and ρ2 , 0.843469. The BIC value for this model, 658.7328, supports
it with respect to all other examined models. The width of the fluctuations
in the observed series is not, however, fully described by this model (Figure
ˆ
6(f)). This is also apparent from the value of ξ=0.13
(Table 5), which is
lower compared to the estimates for Veneto (0.469) and Lombardy (0.538).

The estimates obtained for m in GBMRECT , BeGBMRECT , DMP, DMPseas
and DMPsw range from 31621 (DMPsw) to 34351 (BeGBMRECT ). Conversely, we obtained m̂ = 28968 for the LOG and N̂ = 28955 for the SIRD;
also for this region, the LOG and SIRD models predictions are smaller than
for other models. The total number of cases until May 3rd was 27430. By
comparing this value to m̂=31621 of the DMPsw, we notice that this region,
by May 3rd, experienced 87% of all expected cases.
4.4. Tuscany. The results for Tuscany are displayed in Table 2 (R2 , BIC
and ρ2 ), in Tables 6, 7, A.19–A.23 (for parameter estimates for all the models
fitted) and in Figures 2(d) and 7, where observed and fitted daily values are
plotted.
Also for this region, the logistic (Figure 7(a)) and SIRD (Figure 2(d))
models are the worst performing models in describing the asymmetrical
evolution of the epidemic.
The results in Tables A.20 and A.21 show that a positive (ĉ > 0) rectangular shock is significantly diagnosed at the beginning of the time series,
both in the GBMRECT and the BeGBMRECT . The two models provide the
same estimate for the end of the shock on March 24th (t ' 29), exactly as
observed for Veneto and Piedmont. Notice that here the data start on February 25th because Toscana did not report cases earlier than that. Differently
from other regions, however, for the BeGBMRECT the path is apparently
less perturbed by the shock (see Figure 7(c)).
The DMP model (Figure 7(d) and Table A.22) enables effectively describing the asymmetric behaviour of this time series without shocks. The R2 is
very high (0.999725), with a small BIC value equal to 570.1541, also due to
the parsimony of a model with five parameters only.
The DMPseas, with a weekly cycle (ŝ = 6.982 days) (Table 6), well describes the frequency of the fluctuations and, differently from other regions,
this model is also able to describe their width (Figure 7(e)). The R2 is equal
to 0.999792, although the BIC value is larger than that observed for the

simpler DMP.
The DMPsw (Table 7) returns a value for R2 , 0.999796, slightly larger
than that observed for the DMPseas. From Figure 7(f), however, we can
see that, after the peak, fitted values are almost unaffected by changes in
the number of daily swabs, B(t), although this time series shows important
variations in time (see Figure 4(d)), and ξˆ has a large value (0.78) compared
to other regions. Both the confirmed cases and swab time series exhibit a
weekly pattern, probably due to the organisation of the laboratories, but
since April, the data do not appear to be fully synchronized. This consideration probably explains why the ρ2 value for the DMPsw model (0.778397)
is lower than observed for the DMPseas (0.842169). The latter model better
recognizes the weekly fluctuations in cases, even if the model is less parsimonious.
The estimates obtained for m in GBMRECT , BeGBMRECT , DMP, DMPseas
and DMPsw range from 9948 (GBMRECT ) to 10416 (BeGBMRECT ). The
total number of cases until May 3rd was 9563. By comparing this value to
m̂=10312 of the DMPseas, we notice that this region, by May 3rd, experienced 92.7% of all expected cases.

4.5. Emilia–Romagna. The results for Emilia–Romagna are displayed in
Table 2 (R2 , BIC and ρ2 ), in Tables 8, A.24–A.29 (for parameter estimates
for all the models fitted) and in Figures 2(e) and 8, where observed and
fitted daily values are plotted.
Also for this region, the logistic (Figure 8(a)) and SIRD (Figure 2(e))
models are the worst performing models for describing the asymmetrical
evolution of the epidemic.
The results in Tables A.25 and A.26 show that also here a positive (ĉ > 0)
rectangular shock is significantly diagnosed at the beginning of the time series, both in the GBMRECT and the BeGBMRECT . The two models provide
the same estimate for the end of the shock on March 28th (t ' 34), as observed for Lombardy, which is later than for Veneto, Piedmont and Tuscany.
If we observe Figures 8(b) and (c), we notice, however, that the fit around
the peak is not completely satisfactory, as a small decrease in the number of
confirmed cases actually occurred a few days earlier than predicted by both
models. The R2 for BeGBMRECT is very high (0.999923).
The DMP model (Figure 8(d) and Table A.27) allows for a partially satisfactory description without shocks of the asymmetric behaviour of this time
series. The R2 is equal to 0.999776, and its BIC value and ρ2 are worse than
for the BeGBMRECT (713.4355 and 0.9077, respectively).
The DMPseas, with a weekly cycle (ŝ = 7.004 days) (Table A.28), is not
able to describe the fluctuations (Figure 8(e)). The R2 is equal to 0.999862,
and the BIC value is larger than observed for the BeGBMRECT .
The DMPsw (Table 7) shows a value for R2 , 0.999925, that is slightly
larger than that observed for the BeGBMRECT . From Figure 7(f), we can
see that the fitted values follow the observed data very well, except from the
values around the peak. This behaviour, already noticed for the GBMRECT ,
is responsible for the low ρ2 value, which is equal to 0.904318, lower than
that observed for the DMPseas (0.921988).2
The estimates obtained for m in the LOG model (25140) and N in the
SIRD model (24982) are even lower than the final observation, 26016, representing the total number of cases until May 3rd. The estimates obtained
for m in GBMRECT , BeGBMRECT , DMP, DMPseas and DMPsw range from
28094 (GBMRECT ) to 33428 (DMP). If we consider m̂=30633 of the DMPsw,
we notice that this region, by May 3rd, experienced 84.9% of all expected
cases.
2
If we remove the observations from t=27 to t=33 (around the peak) from the evaluation of ρ2 for all the considered models, we obtain the following values: 0.715193 for the
LOG, 0.879792 for the GBMRECT , 0.895025 for the BeGBMRECT , 0.883395 for the DMP,
0.895168 for the DMPseas and 0.906916 for the DMPsw model.

5. Concluding remarks. The aim of this study was to propose a new
model to describe the pattern of COVID-19 cases in the five most affected
Italian regions. The new model and alternative existing nonlinear model
structures are fitted to the available data.
Our results suggest that the commonly used models, that is, the logistic
and SIRD models, are not flexible. Not only are they incapable of describing
fluctuations; they also fail to follow the asymmetric trend typical of all the
regions: the increase in daily cases has been faster than the decrease observed
in the second part of the outbreak.
In all the analyzed regions, both the GBMRECT and the BeGBMRECT
highlight that a positive shock increased the number of daily cases in a period
starting about two weeks after the first cases and ending around March 24th.
From these results, we deduce that the lockdown policy established by the
Italian government on March 8th played a fundamental role in reducing the
spread of the virus and significantly decreasing daily cases two weeks after
the start of the lockdown.
The models that are available in the literature perform quite well in describing the main trend of daily cases. However, observations also show
significant fluctuations. As highlighted in the introductory section, daily
changes have been reported by the media and have been the focus throughout the most critical weeks of the outbreak. The available data reveal that
the pattern of analyzed swabs is often concordant with the pattern of confirmed cases. This is not surprising, but the models available in the literature
cannot exploit this information. The model proposed here, starting from a
trend described by a dynamic market potential diffusion model, makes it
possible to perturb the trend through an intervention function depending on
the number of analyzed swabs. The larger the number of swabs with respect
to the average, the larger the number of predicted daily cases. The proposed
model, which is highly parsimonious, is able to describe the daily fluctuations in cases very well and proved to be the best of the models analysed

26

here for four of the five regions (Veneto, Lombardy, Piedmont and Emilia–
Romagna). For the fifth region, Tuscany, the pattern of daily cases exhibits
a weekly pattern, but it does not correspond to the pattern of the processed
swabs. For this region, DMPseas performs better in terms of describing the
observed data.
Ahead forecasts have also been evaluated for a period of three weeks. Forecasting is not the aim of this study since the final observation corresponds
to the last day of complete lockdown. We can, however, use our forecasts as
a benchmark corresponding to the evaluation of the trend under lockdown
for comparison with actual observations pertaining to the so-called Phase 2,
where many restrictions have been removed. Note that the Italian government decided to start Phase 2 simultaneously for all the regions, even though
there still were differences among them. By comparing the final cumulative
value of number of cases with the estimated final number of infected patients
in each region at the end of the outbreak, we observed that, while Veneto
and Tuscany reached about 92% of the total number number of the expected
cases by May 3rd, Piedmont, Emilia–Romagna and Lombardy, in particular,
were still facing a more critical situation, having experienced, respectively,
only 87%, 85% and 82% of all expected cases.
The proposed structure for the intervention function is quite intuitive,
and we highlight that the proposed model could also be used to examine the
effect on confirmed cases of different swabbing strategies by modifying the
number of swabs in the intervention function. Alternative formulations, with
a changepoint to allow for a different effect of standardised swabs before and
after the changepoint, have also been estimated, but the improvement with
respect to the proposed DMPsw model was negligible.
