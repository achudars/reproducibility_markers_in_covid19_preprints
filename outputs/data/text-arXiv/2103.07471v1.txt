Abstract
CoV2019 has evolved to be much more dangerous than CoV2003.

Experiments

suggest that structural rearrangements dramatically enhance CoV2019 activity. We
identify a new first stage of infection that precedes structural rearrangements by using
biomolecular evolutionary theory to identify sequence differences enhancing viral
attachment rates. We find a small cluster of four single mutations which show that
CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much stronger viral attachment and enhances
contagiousness. The extremely dangerous dynamics of human coronavirus infection is
a dramatic example of evolutionary approach of self-organized networks to criticality.
It may favor a very successful vaccine. The identified mutations can be used to test the
present theory experimentally. The theory also works well for the newer strains and
explains their increased contagiousness.

Introduction
Coronaviruses were not considered to be highly pathogenic to humans until the outbreak of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 in China1.

Early discussions of their

molecular structure, function and evolution were based on analogies with corresponding
functions from flu and other viruses1,2. These discussions exhibited local contacts of a few spike
receptor binding domain (RBD) amino acids to a few amino acids of respiratory enzymes

2

(ACE2) determined from static crystal structures. Emphasis was placed on similarities and
differences between animal and human (CoV-1) viruses. From these static studies alone it is not
clear why CoV-2 is so much more contagious than CoV-1, or why several more recent strains
containing a few more mutations are even more contagious. Presumably this is caused by
convergent evolution5, which has not occurred recently in other airborne viruses like flu.
Here we review a recent thermodynamic theory of protein dynamics which appears to be
especially well suited to discussing the convergent evolution of spikes sequences which contain
> 1200 amino acids3. Specifically it identifies dynamic features of viral attachment involving
specific amino acids responsible for the asymptomatic phase. One might hope to study these
with molecular dynamic simulations, but these are limited to proteins with lengths of order 50
amino acids or less, whereas spikes contain ~ 800 amino acids. We conclude that new physics
yields important insights into living matter6,7.
Most physics graduate courses in statistical mechanics end with developments up to 1940.
Probably the most important, yet least known, recent developments concern phase transitions in
complex networks8.

Many natural networks exhibit power-law dependence of numbers

describing some quality or quantity. The power-law exponents are called fractals, and fractals
always characterize second-order phase transitions more accurately than simple fractions9. Phase
transitions occur because “some biological systems-parts, aspects, or groups of them-may extract
important functional benefits from operating at the edge of instability, halfway between order
and disorder, i.e., in the vicinity of the critical point of a phase transition. Criticality has been
argued to provide biological systems with an optimal balance between robustness against
perturbations and flexibility to adapt to changing conditions as well as to confer on them optimal
computational capabilities, large dynamical repertoires, unparalleled sensitivity to stimuli, etc.
Criticality, with its concomitant scale invariance, can be conjectured to emerge in living systems
as the result of adaptive and evolutionary processes”7.
Proteins are perhaps the most complex networks, so can we reasonably expect to learn much
about them from studying simpler complex networks which have a single property described by
a single power law and fractal? No, but here there is a hidden simplifying single feature: all
proteins have evolved in water. One can learn to quantify protein interactions with water that
shape protein transitions from resting states to functional states and return them reversibly to

3

their resting states. This program was begun by biologists in the 1970’s, when they began to
develop hydropathicity scales. These scales measure how each of the 20 amino acids in proteins
“like” (hydrophilic) or “dislike” (hydrophobic) water molecules. The idea proved so popular that
by 2000 there were more than 100 biological hydropathicity scales; this has led chemists to
conclude that all such scales have only qualitative value10.
Enter here two Brazilian physicists11, who realized that the protein structural database had grown
enormously by the year 2000. One of the greatest accomplishments of 19th century statistical
mechanics was the invention of an equation of state for molecular systems by van der Waals
(1873). This equation is used to define a size for each molecule, called its van der Waals radius.
The Brazilians revived an old idea, that the hydropathicity of each amino acid in a protein
segment could be measured by the area of a centered van der Waals sphere exposed to water.
They also added a new idea: that because water folds protein chains into globules, the exposed
solvent area (SA) will decrease if one studies protein segments centered on each amino acid.
They then examined more than 5000 protein segments. The lengths of their small segments L =
2N + 1 varied from 3 to 45, but the interesting range ran from 9 to 35. Across this range they
found linear behavior on a log-log plot for each of the 20 amino acids (aa):
logSA(L) ~ const - Ψ(aa) const.logL

( 9 ≤ L ≤ 35)

Here Ψ(aa) is recognizable as a network fractal. It arises because the longer segments fold back
upon themselves. Thus this striking universal result transcends and compresses thousands of
individual protein folding simulations. The 20 fractals based on > 5000 protein segments have
effectively compressed a huge amount of three-dimensional structural data into 20 onedimensional parameters. It was always possible these parameters could have existed in principle,
but no one had thought such a simple and sweeping simplification was possible.
We should now pause to digest this remarkable result. Isn’t it amazing that the single power
laws of other “complex” networks have turned into 20 power laws and 20 fractals for proteins?
It appears that each fractal has achieved an accuracy of better than 1%, so the chances that 20
such fractals should occur together, spanning the same segmental length range, are
astronomically small. The very special features of proteins as living matter, with each protein

4

using the same menu of amino acids to function through millions of reversible phase transitions
before failing, are what have made this happen.
Before going further, one should pause again. Undergraduate thermodynamics teaches us that
there are two kinds of phase transitions, called first- and second-order.

The second-order

transitions involve many long-range interactions, and are much more complex; the Brazilians
found a way to quantify them in proteins. Some proteins, especially those involved in metabolic
shot-range oxygen redux interactions, are better described by a hydropathic scale based on a
first-order effect, such as unfolding from water to air.

This problem had been solved by

biologists in the old days12, and although its applications are more limited, it furnishes a
necessary check on any hydropathic analysis.
The next step is to specialize our analysis to connect to the convergent evolution of a given
protein and its functions. We know a lot about protein functions, and what the structures look
like, for instance, in some static binding states. Still, experiments provide few details about
dynamical interactions, which can, and usually do, involve the entire protein, not just the binding
regions1,2.

These long-range (or allosteric) interactions have been mysterious and resisted

analysis. We do expect that convergent evolution will improve protein functions, probably most
clearly in dynamical interactions which shorten functioning times. Proteins often function by
rotating some domains from the resting to the functional state and back. It could be optimal for
these domains to have similar lengths (like the subcubes in Rubik’s cube), which we call W.
Because proteins have been shaped by water, we now plot the hydropathic parameters Ψ(aa)
across the entire protein sequences always easily obtained (for instance, from Uniprot). At first,
this looks very confusing, because there are hundreds of oscillations. Then we remember the
domains and their motion, so we construct a matrix Ψ(aa,W), with entries averaged over sliding
windows of width W centered on each amino acid. This has a smoothing effect, and the number
of oscillations decreases, as well as their width. The overall width of oscillations of Ψ(aa,W) is
calculated using a standard mathematical tool, the variance {(mean of squares) – (square of
mean)}.
We are now ready to use convergent evolution to our advantage. We can compare proteins from
earlier and later species by taking the ratio of their variances for each W. Features of the

5

resulting plots are often sufficient to suggest optimized values of W. We can plot the profiles
Ψ(aa,W) for two or more species, and physicists who have seen features in optical of simple
inorganic solids often recognize features in such protein profiles. Profiles of hen egg white, and
myoglobin, hemoglobin, and neuroglobin, as well as molecular motors, have evolved in readily
interpreted ways13-15. Each protein family has a fascinating history.
To see how these general considerations work out in practice, let us take a look at what hen egg
white looks like under our evolutionary microscope16. Lysozyme c (aka Hen Egg White, or
HEW) was for some time the most studied protein: the PDB contains more than 200 human and
400 chicken HEW structures. HEW is also present in many other species, not only in the 400
million year old chicken sequence, but in most other vertebrates, almost unchanged in its peptide
backbone structure. The backbone structure is exceptionally stable, with human and chicken
amino acid binding positions superposable to 1.5A°, while the aa sequence mutates from chicken
to human with 60 mutations of its 148 amino acids.
HEW has a nearly centrosymmetric tripartite α helices (1- 56 and 104-148) and β strands (57103) secondary structure, which is conserved for terrestrial animals. During its long career,
HEW has performed at least three functions, as an enzyme, an antibiotic, and most recently an
amyloidosis aggregation suppressor. The relative importance of these functions has changed
from short-lived to long-lived species, and it seems likely that these changes are reflected in the
amino acid mutations that have reshaped and while still maintaining the centrosymmetric
structure. In Fig. 1 we see how these changes look when we change the length W of the sliding
window of our evolutionary microscope using three different scales16.

This rich structure

contains a lot of information. Its structure is centosymmetrical both hydropathically and
elastically, because β strands are elastically stiffer than α helices. The purely elastic features can
be monitored by a third scale which measures the inside/outside (or exposed) tendencies of
amino acids in β strands17.
The evolutionary differences in Fig. 1 are all small near W = 1, which is the length scale L. The
value L = 1 is used in BLAST, the standard tool often used for starting to compare protein
sequences3.

The MZ scale11 shows the largest differences, while the KD scale12 shows the

smallest differences. This means that evolution has made the largest shaping tendencies in longrange inter-domain interactions, with smaller changes in short-range intradomain interactions.

6

The largest MZ peak occurs at W = 69, roughly half the protein length, and reflects overall
smoothing of the human shape by evolution. The secondary peaks near 37 and 51 reflect the
overall smoothing of the central β strand region. This is clear from plotting the actual Ψ(aa,69)
profiles16. There is also some MZ smoothing of the C terminal α helices, which is why these
peaks are larger than those found with the β strand scale. It seems very likely that this smoothing
is enhanced in longer-lived species.
Given a protein hydropathic profile Ψ(aa,W), one notices that it has two kinds of extrema,
hydrophobic maxima and hydrophilic minima. It is natural to suppose that the inside maxima act
as pivots or pinning points for the conformational domain motion that is functionally significant,
while the outer minima act as hinges. This language does not specify the conformational motion
in Euclidean space that is functionally significant, as it jumps directly from the universal
sequence evolution of Ψ(aa) to function. In practice this method has proved to be better than
going elastometrically only between sequence and structure, by using the isotropic vibrational
amplitudes of individual amino acids measured in structural studies.

The latter cannot be

converted into long-range strain fields without knowing distant interatomic force fields in great
detail (not possible for large proteins). Again this shows that great simplifications are possible
using water interactions just because they are weak, and dominate protein shapes in the length
range 9 ≤ L ≤ 35.
What happens when the extrema of an optimized Ψ(aa,W) are nearly level? Examples of such
leveling were apparent in studies of several proteins, such as aspirin, where leveling was
medically important18, and this appeared to be a new idea. It is called synchronization, and there
are examples of it both in simple mathematical models19,20 and in many single-fractal networks8.
This concept is the key to using Ψ(aa,W) profiles to identify the mutations responsible for the
asymptomatic phase of Cov19. In practice, with W as the only parameter, the evolutionary
convergence of multiple extrema toward synchronization can be unambiguous.

Results
The range of protein structures and functions is very large, and thermodynamic methods did not
work well for flu viruses, whose strains are variable, but are usually very contagious only when

7

vaccines fail. However, a glance at Coronavirus structure shows that their spikes are long and
are immersed in water, which makes the mutational differences between the CoV-1 and CoV-2
amino acid sequences ideal subjects for analysis by hydropathic scaling. The current coronavirus
belongs to a virus family that also causes common colds. CoV-1 and CoV-2 are much more
dangerous. Worse still, many numbers now show that CoV-2 (2019) spikes have evolved to be
much more dangerous than CoV-1(2003) spikes. Much of this “nearly perfect” 2019 viral
action20 can be explained in terms of two well-studied cleavage-trimeric reassembly structural
differences of coronal spikes3. The spikes contain > 1200 amino acids, and BLAST shows that
~ 300 of these are mutated. Can only a few of these 300 mutations, far from the two cleavage
sites, also be contributing to the extremely strong viral interaction of CoV-2? How do we
identify these possibly critical distal sites, which are so far unrecognized in static studies?
Patient readers will have guessed by now that thermodynamic hydropathic scaling is a method
that is perfectly suited to answering the obvious questions21 about the convergent evolution of
CoV to becoming the most contagious and persistent virus in history. Schrodinger in his Dublin
lectures (1943) asked, What is life?22 General ideas that have been discussed by physicists
(especially since the discovery of DNA) are extended by scaling to include quantitative details of
protein evolution, and now lead us to explicit models23,24 of the asymptomatic stage of CoV-2,
now much more prominent than it was in CoV-1.
The overall profiles of CoV-1 and CoV-2 in Fig. 2 seem at first to be very similar, in spite of the
300 mutations in CoV-2. The strong hydrophobic peak at the C terminal end is little changed,
but a closer look (Fig. 3) in the central region shows large changes (Table 1). The CoV-1 edge
near 550 has shifted upwards (hydrophobically) in CoV-2. . The striking change in minimum 2
is caused by a cluster of four key mutations from CoV-1 to CoV-2. These are (CoV-1 site
numbering from Uniprot P59594): 546Gln to Leu; 556 and 561Ser to Ala; and 568Ser to Leu.
The differences associated with each of these key mutations are hydropathically large (~50-100
in the MZ scale24; all 20 amino acids span a range from most hydrophilic to most hydrophobic
of 170). It is this cluster of four single site mutations that bring minimum 2 from CoV-1 into
synchronized alignment with minima 1,4, and 5.
Hydropathic synchronization explains the appearance of the asymptomatic phase, because it is
presumably associated with viral concentration in the upper respiratory tract, which is moister,

8

and from which aerosol-borne viruses can be expelled. The second stage of infection involves
viral fusing with cells through trimeric spike formation3. Several new strains have appeared,
with further synchronization. Thus the UK strain is about twice as level as CoV-2 (Table 1). At
this point the synchronized effects are near the limits of accuracy of the MZ scale. To see how
useful the concept of phase transitions is, the profiles of CoV-1 and CoV-2 were compared wit
the first-order KD scale12,24, and there was no edge alignment23. Those who are interested in
further checks on the unique accuracy of the MZ scale might use any of the other 100+
hydropathicity scales available in the biological literature.attached
A more interesting test of the thermodynamic theory is provided by the new California strain,
which has only one additional mutation, L452R25. Its effect on edge 1 (centered at 454) can be
calculated from the MZ values of L and R, with W = 35. It shifts this edge lower by 3.4 to
133.7. The four edges remain well synchronized, while their overall average has been lowered.
Thus the edges are more hydrophilic. This could lead to more attachment in the throat (faster
spreading), as well as faster trimeric reassembly in the lungs16.
Conclusions
The level hydrophilic extrema of Ψ(aa,35) of the spikes of CoV-2 may be unique among viruses.
These level extrema bring CoV-2 contagion very close to a critical point. Because CoV-2 is very
close to a critical point, its symptoms can vary widely between individuals.

One of the

symptoms is loss of smell and taste. A large statistical survey reported that this was often an
“all-or-nothing” effect26 characteristic of a critical point. Because of interactions with other
proteins, the individual reaction can bifurcate on either side of the critical point. Thus very small
differences in many genes can cause large fluctuations in infection levels and fatalities between
different countries. A recent review concludes that these differences are indeed large worldwide
and could have many causes27. It also remarks that “epidemiology isn’t physics”, but the physics
of phase transitions provides criticality as a single cause for diverse effects. Another example is
the fractal behavior of COV infection curves28. Phase transitions even predicted in the abstract
of an early paper the high success rate of spike-based vaccines23.

Table 1. CoV-1 edges are poorly aligned23.

For edges (1,2,4,5) the CoV-2 and CoVUK

(B.1.1.7) deviations are 4% and 2% of the overall range of Ψ(R,35). These very small deviations
are the result of dynamical synchronization23. Edge 3 is located near the S1/S2 cleavage site.
Note that new mutations can be significant if they lie within 17 amino acids of these five, and
involve large (non-synonomous) changes in Ψ(aa). An example of a nonsynonomous change is
A to D (change 70), while the synonomous E to K change is only 824. Note that these four edge
(1,2,4,5) W = 35 windows occupy only 10% of the viral spike length. It seems very unlikely that
four large hydropathic shifts could cluster in exactly the narrow range around edge 2 to make it
level with edges 1, 4 (which also shifted into better alignment) and 5. This “unlikely” effect is
the result of convergent evolution.
