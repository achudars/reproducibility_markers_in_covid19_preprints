Abstract
Strategies adopted globally to mitigate the threat of COVID–19 have primarily
involved lockdown measures with substantial economic and social costs with varying
degrees of success. Morbidity patterns of COVID–19 variants have a strong association with age, while restrictive lockdown measures have association with negative
mental health outcomes in some age groups. Reduced economic prospects may also
afflict some age cohorts more than others. Motivated by this, we propose a model to
describe COVID–19 community spread incorporating the role of age-specific social
interactions. Through a flexible parameterisation of an age-structured deterministic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed (SEIR) model, we provide a means for
characterising different forms of lockdown which may impact specific age groups differently. Social interactions are represented through age group to age group contact
matrices, which can be trained using available data and are thus locally adapted.
This framework is easy to interpret and suitable for describing counterfactual scenarios, which could assist policy makers with regard to minimising morbidity balanced
with the costs of prospective suppression strategies. Our work originates from an
Irish context and we use disease monitoring data from February 29th 2020 to January 31st 2021 gathered by Irish governmental agencies. We demonstrate how Irish
lockdown scenarios can be constructed using the proposed model formulation and
show results of retrospective fitting to incidence rates and forward planning with
relevant “what if / instead of” lockdown counterfactuals. Uncertainty quantification for the predictive approaches is described. Our formulation is agnostic to a

Introduction

The global race to manage the existential threat posed by COVID–19 has used nonpharmaceutical lockdown (or restriction of movement) measures as a central tenet. These
will continue to play a major role in public health policy as new variants emerge and
before a full vaccine roll-out has been reached. As nations have come to terms with
COVID–19 throughout the past year, the societal and economic impacts of the pandemic
have become clear. A systemic shock to the world of work, widespread job losses in certain economic sectors, and a vast reduction in person-to-person social contact has given
rise to an epoch of uncertainty, anxiety and fear. While older individuals are observed to
be gravely threatened by the risk of infection, younger people have been particularly impacted by deteriorating mental health during this time (Kwong et al., 2020) in addition to
reduced economic prospects (Darmody et al., 2020). Governments have found themselves
performing a difficult balancing act. Strict lockdown measures are necessary for public
safety and to prevent health systems becoming overwhelmed. However, periods of strict
measures need to be punctuated by temporary easing of restrictions whenever possible to
give hope to businesses and reduce the psycho-social demands placed on citizens. National
“maps” and “road-plans” for emerging from COVID–19 that were proposed in the first
quarter of 2020 by national Governments have been tweaked and revised world-wide; the
time elapsed since March 2020 has been characterised by an ebb and flow of various forms
of restriction of movement, both within and between nations.
It seems that lockdown measures and their consequences will be present in citizens’
lives for some time to come. Certain measures or guidelines to citizens may target specific
age groups. For example, guidance has often urged extra protection for the elderly; in
Ireland and the UK, this has been termed “cocooning”. There has been much debate
about the risks posed by keeping schools for children open and as a result there has
been variation in school closures globally. Quantifying the potential impact of new or
changing measures that target age cohorts differently is thus essential. The exploration
and consideration of counterfactuals can provide valuable lessons and insights to policy
makers at a time of much uncertainty.
Our contribution in this article is to propose and calibrate a flexible model within
the Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered (SEIR) class, which can characterise different
forms of lockdown measures with age structuring. The implied mortality burden of a
lockdown architecture can be assessed through forward projection from the model. We
show how this age-structured SEIR model, which includes explicit modelling of social
2

mixing, can be used to assess and quantify the overall potential disease burden resulting
from restriction of movement measures. Social mixing is modelled using age group to
age group contact rates, allowing for assessment of the long run impact brought about
by lockdowns which implicitly target specific age groups. The primary benefit of this
approach is the potential to evaluate the ‘cost’ of specific intervention actions in terms of
impacts on the general public. If each of the public health interventions that are being
considered can be economically costed, then a strategy for disease suppression in tandem
with minimising economic costs can be explored. As an example, forward projection can
indicate costs to economic sectors such as the night–time economy which relies heavily
on young adults. This view is not constrained to economic costs alone, as public health
authorities may alternatively focus on health costs such as mental health impacts brought
about by constraints on social mixing amongst the general public.
There has been some exploration of age-structured SEIR models for disease incidence.
Teimouri (2020) constructed an age-structured SEIR model for the London area which
incorporates contact tracing; their interest was detailing the impact of social mixing and
contact tracing on the effective reproduction rate of the disease as opposed to model
calibration. In a similar vein, Grimm et al. (2021) use assumed epidemiological parameters
to simulate the impact of age-specific control measures and contact tracing impact with a
focus on the impact of control measures on factors including hospitalisations and deaths.
Lee et al. (2021) simulate the impact of four control measures, namely, school closure,
social distancing, quarantine, and isolation on reproduction rates in South Korea using an
age-structured SEIR model of disease spread. Maximum likelihood estimation is used to
estimate contact scaling parameters, however no uncertainty in estimates or projections
is presented. Cuevas-Maraver et al. (2021) propose a two-cohort age-segmented model
(age in years ≤65/>65) for Mexican incidence counts and illustrate that age specific
control measures may have utility for public health policy decisions. Kimathi et al. (2021)
simulate the impact of three specific governmental interventions on case incidence using
an age-structured SEIR model with predetermined model parameters.
The dynamics of the age-structured SEIR model we propose have a number of advantages over these competing approaches. We account for the impact of movement restrictions on population mixing by scaling age-structured contact matrices, as with Prem et al.
(2020), however our scaling parameters are calibrated using the time series of observed
Irish incidence counts as opposed to best-guess estimates. Where the parameters governing dynamics of models cannot be estimated due to data sparsity, we use recent results
published in the COVID–19 literature on infection dynamics as well as expert opinion
from the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group (IEMAG); note that IEMAG
developed an initial SEIR model (IEMAG, 2020) that we extend. We use a statistical
bootstrapping approach to present uncertainties in learned parameters, in addition to
providing uncertainty intervals for incidence projections.

The available data for calibration of social contacts consists of daily count incidences
and the specific lockdown measures implemented within Ireland from February 29th 2020
to January 31st 2021. While we present an analysis specific to an Irish context, we argue
that the proposed approach is adaptable to other locales, wherein region specific macrolevel behaviours can be calibrated. Furthermore, the framework we present can be easily
adapted to incorporate more in depth population mixing knowledge from contact-tracing
initiatives as well as allowing for estimation of all unknown model parameters.
Based on the SEIR model described in this article, we have developed an R Shiny app
interface that, given a user specified lockdown regime, creates an 8 week ahead forecast
for estimated deaths and economic costs in Dublin. The app is accessible at http://
54.75.10.2:3838/ForecastApp/ with the app code available at https://github.com/
fatimZJ/Covid-19-Project.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview
of observed COVID–19 incidence data and lockdown architectures in Ireland, a model of
the effects of these lockdowns on social mixing by rescaling the population contact matrix
over time, and the associated economic impacts. In Section 3 we present our proposed
age-structured SEIR model which incorporates the scaled elements of the contact matrix,
and, hence, lockdown effects. Section 4 describes calibration of the free parameters in
the model, and quantification of uncertainty using a bootstrapping approach. Section 5
outlines the results of retrospective model fitting to Irish data, with associated projections
and examples of some interesting counterfactual situations provided in Section 6. We
conclude in Section 7 with a discussion.

Data sources

We restrict our data sources to those that are typically freely publicly available, allowing
for ease of implementation in other regions. The available data in an Irish context consists
of daily incidence counts and the dates of changes of lockdown restrictions. Estimated
contact matrices for age structured population mixing are sourced from literature. We
defer discussion of the mechanistic parameters sourced from the COVID–19 literature to
Section 3.

2.1

Daily incidence counts

The Irish Health Surveillance Protection Centre (data.gov.ie) provide anonymised daily
COVID–19 incidences. We use the data from the period of February 29th 2020 to January
31st 2021 for model calibration. The daily COVID–19 count incidence is shown in Fig 1.
Age structured case count data is not publicly available in Ireland, and hence we use
aggregate case counts at the population level. We use projected population data for 2019

to estimate the age-structured population breakdown by county to estimate Dublin’s
population. Given the constraints on public movement, we make the assumption that the
2019 projections are representative of the population since the beginning of the pandemic.

Form of lockdown restrictions

Fig 1 shows the timeline and duration of varying degrees of restriction measures (vertical
dashed lines) implemented in Ireland from March 2020. In line with IEMAG (2020), we
define the 28th February 2020 as “day zero” of the Irish epidemic. As with many other
countries, the Irish government introduced a strict lockdown in the early stages of the
pandemic which lasted until May 2020. This lockdown was followed by a gradual easing
of restrictions throughout the summer until case numbers began to rise in early autumn,
when harsher restrictions were reintroduced and another phase of a strict lockdown was
announced for late October. Restrictions were eased over the month of December but a
subsequent wave of cases forced the implementation of a further strict lockdown immediately after the December holiday period. A more detailed overview of the restrictions is
provided in Table S1 in supplementary material A.
The nature of restrictions on public mobility in Ireland, announced by the Irish
government in April 2020, follow five levels. Level one is the least restrictive with this
increasing to most restrictive at level five. In level one, food venues and bars remain open,
gatherings of up to fifty people are permitted outdoors and sporting events can take place

with restrictions on numbers. Level five corresponds to a near total blanket close on all
activities. As the public health situation evolved during 2020, small adjustments were
made to these levels with slight easing of targeted restrictions (for example, reopening
of schools or childcare) within more severe lockdowns. An overview of the five level
lockdowns is provided in Table 1 with in-depth detail available at gov.ie/en/campaigns/
resilience-recovery-2020-2021-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/. We denote the
time intervals of lockdown measures using Ik = (rk , rk+1 ], where rk is the time of the
beginning of the kth regime for k = 1, . . . , N where N = 12, with the first regime
corresponding to no intervention from 29th February to 11th March 2020. Thus, we
define r1 = 0 corresponding to 29th February 2020 and rN +1 = 336 corresponding to 31th
January 2021.

2.3

Age structuring and social mixing

COVID–19 is an airborne virus, hence consideration of close social mixing in the population is essential to capturing the observed patterns of infection. Furthermore, the strong
association of morbidity patterns with the elderly, and more recently younger persons
(Taylor, 2021), suggest consideration of age structured social mixing will be a key component of future projections (Prem et al., 2020; Cuevas-Maraver et al., 2021). Age-structured
social mixing is typically captured in SEIR models through the use of age group to age
group contact matrices. Although such matrices cannot capture the granular complexity
of individual human interactions, they provide a reasonable approximation that can be in6

Age group

corporated into mathematical models for infectious diseases as demonstrated by Mossong
et al. (2008), and within this article. We follow Prem et al. (2020) and stratify the population into five-year bands from age 0 up to age 75, with one category for all individuals
aged 75 and above, giving A = 16 age groups.
Contact tracing has been a prominent factor in disease suppression in Asian countries
to date. However, such data is not available in an Irish context, and we are unaware of any
large-scale survey or study on age-structured social mixing patterns in Ireland. However,
Fumanelli et al. (2012) and Prem et al. (2017) provide a methodology for deriving contact
patterns by leveraging mixing patterns studied in other European countries. Our analysis
relies on contact matrices given by Prem et al. (2017) who projected age and location
specific contact matrices in 16 age bands for 152 countries including Ireland. These are
constructed from the POLYMOD study (Mossong et al., 2008), which incorporated largescale demographic household surveys (from the UN population division) and school and
labour force participation rates. The estimated Irish contact interactions are shown in
Fig 2. For the purpose of our work, we sum together expected contacts in the home, work,
school and other locations to give an overall matrix of expected contacts (‘All’ in Fig 2).
We assume that the Irish contact matrix applies to just Dublin.

Government interventions to suppress virus spread result in changes in population

to the kth of N lockdown regimes. The aforementioned age-structured contact matrices
are formed by entries ci j representing the average number of daily contacts between an
individual in age category i with an individual in age category j, where i, j = 1, . . . , A.

In Section 3 we outline the estimation of the scaling parameters θ = (θ1 , . . . , θN ) for
each lockdown period using observed incidences in Dublin. This allows an estimation of
macro-level behavioural changes in socialising brought about by specific measures.

2.4

Economic cost of lockdown measures

Our age-structured modelling approach offers the potential for evaluation of age-related
economic or health costs in tandem with public morbidity. Here, we explore costing economic impacts of different lockdown measures used by the Irish government to date. There
has been much interest in the economic impact of COVID–19, with a rapidly expanding
literature. For example, Eichenbaum et al. (2020) study the basic macroeconomics of
epidemics while Brodeur et al. (2020) attempt a partial literature review of the main approaches to macroeconomic costing of the epidemic to date. Kaplan et al. (2020) extend
the canonical macroeconomic framework to SEIR models of the type we develop in this
paper. Beirne et al. (2020) produce initial estimates of the medium-term impact of the
crisis on the Irish economy. Relating to Ireland, we draw on the work of Woloszko (2020)
in order to construct weekly estimates of year on year (same week in different years)
growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This existing approach makes forecasts
based on a neural network modelling framework, with training of the model done via
quarterly GDP and Google Trends search intensity data gathered over forty six countries
from the beginning of 2005 for sixty one quarters. The quarterly data is used to construct a forecasting model corresponding to a weekly resolution making an assumption of
frequency neutrality (Woloszko, 2020).
While there are obvious criticisms of using GDP as a sound economic measure, here
we employ it as a proxy to give a high level view of implied costs of lockdown to the
economy. In this frame of reference, we can justify the approximation in three ways.
Firstly, GDP is an aggregate flow measure containing values in euros of expenditures
by households, firms, and government, particularly the importing, and exporting parts
of the Irish economy (Coyle, 2015). The weekly GDP tracker combines the sometimes
countervailing microeconomic elements of the COVID crisis into a single variable. While
8

expenditures by the household and corporate sectors was reduced due to government
restrictions, the government expanded its support activities in terms of direct payments
to furloughed workers, turnover replacements and generous liquidity packages for firms,
debt and tax arrears-warehousing, and increases in direct spending on health-related
measures (Devereux et al., 2020). Secondly, it is acknowledged that Ireland is a small
open economy with a very large multinational sector relative to other countries of similar
size and development level. While GDP is understood for example by Fitzgerald (2020)
as being a relatively poor measure of the health of the Irish economy due to the influence
of large multinational companies on the economy, these companies, particularly in the
pharmaceutical and ICT sectors, helped keep the government’s budget deficit lower than
it otherwise would have been. Finally, the weekly GDP calculations of Woloszko (2020)
enable the production of a measure of the overall economic impact of COVID–19 relative
to each lockdown period. A weekly tracker of economic activity allows for matching of
economic predictions with the timescale of typical lockdown duration. The generation
of in-model behavioural elasticities using a panel of 46 countries across several decades
also means the model has the ability to react within a period of crisis, as the economy’s
participants learn from the first lockdown experience, and adapt themselves to cope with
further lock downs.

SEIR model specification

Irish population modelling of COVID–19 during the crisis has been carried out by the Irish
Epidemiological Modelling and Advisory Group (IEMAG) (IEMAG, 2020). They present
a model for the Irish population where, at any point in time, an individual is assumed to
be in one of a number of distinct model compartments that describe COVID–19 status.
Movement between compartments over time is based on the current understanding of the
epidemiology of COVID–19, as evidenced by the extensive literature review and evidence
synthesis conducted by Griffin et al. (2020); McAloon et al. (2020); Byrne et al. (2020).
We evolve this model to consider age-structured differences in population mixing. We
assume closed age classes, such that population Ni of age class i is the sum of susceptible
(Si ), exposed (Ei ), infected and removed (Ri ) compartments for that age class. There
is no movement between age classes. Infected cases fall into a number of compartments:
asymptomatic (IiAS ), pre-symptomatic (IiPS ), symptomatic and self-isolating without testing (IiSI ), symptomatic and awaiting test results (IiST ), symptomatic and isolating after
receiving positive test results (IiPI ) and symptomatic but not tested or isolating (IiSN ).
The closed age class assumption implies that
Ni = Si + Ei + IiAS + IiPS + IiSI + IiST + IiPI + IiSN + Ri ,

Exposed individuals are those incubating the disease but not yet infectious. Asymptomatic individuals are infectious but do not exhibit symptoms. Pre-symptomatic individuals are infectious but have yet to show symptoms. As pre-symptomatic individuals’
symptoms develop, they will move to one of the infectious or symptomatic compartments,
either self isolating and following government guidance around testing, or neither getting
tested nor isolating when symptomatic, i.e., ignoring symptoms. Following infection, individuals move to the removed class (Ri ), which accounts for cases who recover and those
who die.

and I ( t ∈ Ik ) is an indicator function which equals one when t ∈ Ik and is zero otherwise.
Susceptible individuals in age class i are exposed to the virus through contacts with
infected individuals in all age classes and this is described through the function gi (t, z, θ).
The level of exposure is modulated by the scaled average number of daily contacts with
each age class, with a scaling factor for each lockdown regime. The parameters α and κ are
used to describe transmission dynamics with respect to the various infected compartments.
The reduction of transmission due to being asymptomatic is given by α which is taken as
0.55 (Evoy et al., 2020). Individuals in isolation are expected to have a reduced infectious
burden on those they interact with. This is described using κ = 0.05 (IEMAG, 2020) and
we assume an identical reduced burden from those who are positive and isolating.
The SEIR model makes extensive use of β, the multiplicative force of infection. β
is chosen based on a specified value of R0 , the baseline reproduction rate. Baseline here
highlights that this is the expected reproduction rate in Dublin, with a fully susceptible
population (i.e., Si = Ni , i = 1, . . . , A), under no intervention. R0 can be expressed as
11

the largest absolute eigenvalue of the next generation matrix, Q = F V−1 (Diekmann
et al., 1990), where F and V are block matrices which describe the transmissions and
the transitions between compartments, respectively. The analytic form of these matrices
b the
is given in supplementary material B. Factoring β out of the F matrix, F = β F,
dominant eigenvalue of Q can be expressed as a product of β and the dominant eigenvalue
b V−1 . Hence, if R0 is determined and β is desired, the expression can easily be
of F
rearranged to give β as follows:
β = R0 /ξ
(2)
b V−1 . Note, the values of R0 and β are only calculated
where ξ is the largest eigenvalue of F
once as they are baseline values; shifts in infection dynamics away from the baseline are
captured by θ. Our choice for R0 is 3.4, based on Náraigh and Byrne (2020). This leads
to β = 0.031 when not under intervention. A full list of parameter value settings used
in our modelling is given in supplementary material Table S2. We note here that the
θk , k = 1, . . . , N are unknown. The next section describes how these are estimated using
observed case incidences.

Model Fitting

Specification of the model in Section 3 uses parameters θ = (θ1 , . . . , θN ) to rescale, for
each of the N = 12 lockdown intervention policies, what would have been the assumed average contacts between individuals in the various age classes under normal circumstances
(i.e., prior to the pandemic). Estimation of these parameters is of interest in predicting
behaviour during lockdown, and hence for forecasting the benefit of specific interventions.
Note that the remaining parameters (i.e., those other than θ) on which the dynamics of
the SEIR model (1) depend, describing the flow of individuals between compartments, are
based on expert opinion (IEMAG, 2020; Náraigh and Byrne, 2020). The data currently
available is not sufficiently rich to estimate these. We first describe estimation of θ and
then a parametric bootstrap method (Pawitan, 2001) to provide uncertainty, which can
be propagated through model forecasts.
In order to link the model with observed data we monitor the cumulative number
of cases up to time t for each age class. It is only cases exiting the IiST , i = 1, . . . , A
compartment that can be linked to observed incidence counts in the general population.
We can think of a variable, counting infected cases as they exit compartment IiST before
going into IiPI . For scaling θ, age class i and time t, denote this by Xi (t; θ). This can be
related to the other model compartments through
I ST
dXi
= i ,

i = 1, . . . , A.

To compare outputs from the SEIR model with observed data, we use this count
aggregated over age classes:
A
X
X(t; θ) =
Xi (t; θ),
(4)
i=1

which gives total cumulative case counts to time t. Evaluating this at td = hd, d =
1, . . . , n where h generates a time discretisation corresponding to consecutive days, we can
then compare X(td ; θ) to observed cumulative cases at day d. We denote the observed
cumulative counts at day d by xd .

4.1

Estimation of regime specific contact scaling parameters

To estimate θ, we minimize the squared error loss, i.e., the residual sum of squares,
RSS(θ) =

n
X

(xd − X(td ; θ))2

d=1

on cumulative case counts. Minimization is carried out using the default Nelder-Mead
alogrithm (Nelder and Mead, 1965) provided in the R package optimx (Nash et al., 2011).
Note that each step of this algorithm, corresponding to a proposed θ vector, requires the
calculation of X(t; θ) to evaluate the suitability of θ through RSS(θ). In order to obtain
X(t; θ), the system of ODEs given in (1) are numerically solved using the R package
deSolve (Soetaert et al., 2010). Specifically, we have found the lsoda function within
this package to be particularly flexible, providing automatic selection of stiff or non-stiff
methods; see Nash et al. (2011) for details. When solving the system of ODEs for a
candidate θ, we take IiPS = 1/A, Ei = 15/A and hence Si = Ni − 16/A as the initial values
for i = 1, . . . , A, as per IEMAG (2020). The initial values for the remaining compartments
are set to 0. Multiple random initialisations of θ are used to improve robustness of the
overall algorithm with respect to the issue of convergence to a local minima. When
generating these initial vectors, we assume that the effect of lockdown measures is to
reduce social mixing below pre-pandemic levels, and, therefore, use a U (0, 1) draw to
initialise each parameter, i.e., θ 0k ∼ U (0, 1), k = 1, . . . , N . A summary of our estimation
procedure is given in Algorithm 1.
Since we have to solve the ODEs (1) numerically using lsoda of each iteration within
the optimx optimisation, the above procedure is computationally intensive. On average
it takes approximately one hour to run the optimisation for each random initialisation,
and we have used C = 300 random initialisations. Thus, to improve the computational
feasibility, we have run initialisations in parallel on an EC2 instance hosted by Amazon
Web Services with 32 cores and 64 GB memory.

Propagating uncertainty in contact scaling parameters

We explore uncertainty in the estimation of θ and investigate how this propagates into
the reproductive rate. In order to quantify uncertainty we follow Chowell (2017) by using
a parametric bootstrap approach. This approach makes use of an assumed generative
parametric model for daily case counts based on the observed case counts. This model is
then used to re-generate B synthetic instances of the daily new case series; each of these
instances is used to re-estimate the vector θ. The resulting empirical distribution of the
b
re-estimated vectors can be used as an approximation to the sampling distribution of θ
(the estimate based on the original cumulative case counts).
b is found using the observed daily cumulative counts as described

predicted using

Results

In this section we present the results of fitting the age-structured SEIR model to the
Irish data using the methodology described in Section 4, and also discuss some economic
findings.

respectively), while Fig 4(b) shows a plot of the model fit to the daily new cases data
b − X(td−1 ; θ)
b and xd − xd−1 respectively). Both figures illustrate that the
(i.e., X(td ; θ)
model provides a good fit to the observed data albeit with slight deviations in the early
days of the epidemic and later around the December holiday and New Year period. We
observe from the model fit to daily new cases that these periods were characterised by
larger variability in the daily recorded number of new cases. The presence of outliers may
be as a result of data reporting issues, especially over the December holiday period. For
example, in Ireland a testing backlog developed over this period with test results from
multiple days being subsequently batched together.

Fig 5 displays the estimated scaling parameters θ with bootstrapped 2.5% and 97.5%
percentiles for each government policy observed over the period of study. The associated
numeric values are deferred to Table S2 supplementary material.
The scaling parameter estimate for the no-intervention period, θb1 ≈ 1.27 (95% CI
0.90 - 1.94), indicates that the social contact patterns based on the POLYMOD study
may be slightly under-estimating the current Irish contact patterns. Perhaps somewhat
surprisingly, the parameter θb2 , corresponding to an initial school closure period, is greater
than one (95% CI 1.78 - 2.72). However, this might be explained by the fact that it corresponds to a short period of time where no other measures had yet been introduced (apart
from pub closures later in the period), but with an imminent government announcement
of a strict nationwide lockdown expected – in line with what had been observed in other
countries already by this stage in the global pandemic. During this period there was
frenzied panic buying and stock piling of goods, increased travel across the country, and
possibly increased social gatherings prior to movement restrictions. The remaining scaling
parameters behave as expected based on the level of restrictions in place at that time:
the higher the levels of restrictions, the smaller the scaling parameter, corresponding to
reduced social mixing. The confidence intervals just prior to and including the holiday
period indicate that social mixing returned to a near normal level at that time where a
dramatic spike in the case numbers was also observed. This was followed immediately by
a heavy lockdown and consequent drop in case numbers; indeed, the scaling parameter
for this final period has the smallest value of all.
Over the period of study, note that we have witnessed two lockdown Level 3 periods
(September/October and December 2020). However, although in theory both periods
were designated as “lockdown Level 3” by the Irish government, we have applied two
separate scaling parameters for these two periods as the December lockdown included
some relaxations compared to a full Level 3 lockdown. Specifically, non-essential retail
and services were open once again and indoor service in restaurants and cafes was also
permitted. This was done to facilitate people’s social needs around the holiday period,
and indeed we see that the estimated parameter value for lockdown Level 3+ (December)
is much larger than that for lockdown Level 3 (September/October). Again because of
modifications in the execution, we have separate scaling parameters for the lockdown
Level 5 in October/November and what we call the lockdown Level 5+ January 2021;
the latter was stricter following the large rise in case numbers during the holiday period,
and this is reflected in the small scaling value for this period as previously mentioned.
Since the lockdown levels commenced with (what we label as) a Level 2 in August 2020,
we have not observed a Level 1 or 4 lockdown. Prior to August 2020, the lockdowns and
relaxations were more ad-hoc and do not fit into any particular governmental lockdown
level. The contact matrices corresponding to the policy interventions based on our fitted
model are displayed in Fig S1 in the supplementary material.

Figure 5: Estimates of the scaling parameters with bootstrapped 95% uncertainty bounds.
An important epidemic metric is the effective reproductive number, R(t), which describes the expected number of secondary infections at time t. It differs from R0 , the
baseline reproduction number, in that it changes over time and takes into account that
the whole population will not be fully susceptible. R(t) can be calculated as the product
of R0 and the total proportion of susceptibles in the population at time t (see for example
Nishiura and Chowell (2009)). In the context of our model, the baseline reproductive
number is R0 θk (rather than just R0 ) to account for the rate at which individuals interact
with each other; recall from Section 2.3 that θk is the scaling parameter corresponding to
the time interval Ik = (rk , rk+1 ]. Therefore, the effective reproductive number is
e
R(t) = R0 θk S(t),

e = PA Si (t)/ PA Ni (t) is the proportion of susceptible individuals in the the

entire population at time t. Fig 6 displays the estimate of R(t) based on our fitted model.
An R(t) > 1 implies the infections will continue to grow exponentially, whereas R(t) < 1
implies infections are declining to zero; R(t) ≈ 1 indicates a constant infection level. We
see here that prior to the first heavy lockdown in April, R(t) was initially very large.
This dropped below one following that first lockdown, but gradually increased again over
the summer period when relaxations were introduced. It was brought back under control
with successive Level 3 and Level 5 lockdowns, but markedly increased over the run-up
to the December holiday period; R(t) was then driven towards zero with the lockdown
Level 5+.

Assessing the economic cost of policy interventions

The approach of Woloszko (2020) provides us with a trained model to estimate weekly
GDP growth during the pandemic. The inputs to the model are the ∆sl,w , year on year
differences in weekly log search intensities on Google Trends for l = 1, . . . , 24 search
terms over w = 1, . . . , 52 weeks. The model has a country specific fixed effect resulting
in country targeted forecasts (denoted here by “ire” for Ireland). The inputs are passed
to a nonlinear function fb(·, ·), which has been trained using historic data as described in
Section 2.4. This results in
gbire,w



b
= f {∆sl,w }l,w , “ire”

where gbire,w , is a forecast of GDP growth for week w in Ireland.
Assuming weights equal to 1/48 (due to a 48 week working year) and an average
counterfactual annualised growth of 5.8% given by a naive forecast, the impact on growth
1
rates per week can be calculated as 48
(5.8 − gbire,w ). Multiplying these by 2019 measures of
GDP in euros gives an estimated cost per week in nominal euros. A counter-factual “no
COVID” scenario can be constructed by naively forecasting the 2019 estimated weekly
growth rate forward using an ARIMA(1, 1, 1) model to provide g̃ire,w , with GDP in
18

nominal euros is estimated in the same way. Fig 7 shows the weekly estimates of GDP
for each approach, with the difference in weekly GDP figures between the approaches
suggesting an estimate of the economic cost per week of pandemic related measures.
Linking estimated weekly costs to the lockdown strategies implemented results in the
estimated economic costs shown in Table 2.

Table 2: Estimated economic costs for each lockdown period.
This simple analysis shows that relative to the counterfactual “no COVID” experiment, the majority of cost to society was incurred during the first intense lockdown period.
Recoveries tended to overshoot the naive forecasted values (hence the negative readings in
Table 2 for the relaxation of interventions) for a number of reasons. For example, pent up
19

demand in the household sector, once released, is very easily produced and consumed. The
economy was also supported by large-scale government intervention which began at scale
in May and June of 2020 involving government injection of cash directly into the economy
to support households and firms. Participants in the economy adapted and adjusted to
their changed circumstances. This is why the calculation of elasticities in Woloszko (2020)
is important to include. Once people moved their consumption online, and government
supports were in place, the impact of the crisis was substantially attenuated.

Forward projection and counterfactual scenario analysis

A key strength of our modelling framework is that it enables forward projection, and
quantification of projection uncertainty, of anticipated case numbers under specific health
interventions. In the following we simulate epidemiological and economic costs of a number of counterfactual scenarios based on hypothetical policy decisions taken by the Irish
Government. We compare these to observed epidemiological data for that period to evaluate predictive performance. Table S5 in the supplementary material presents the Irish
Health Protection and Surveillance Centre’s (HPSC’s) total number of cases and deaths
up to 28th December 2020 (HPSC, 2020). The data was no longer broken down by age
category to the same granularity after that date. From this we can establish approximate
estimates of death rates for each age class that we can apply to the forecasts of the SEIR
model.

6.1

Projected cases, economic costs and deaths

Evaluation of the health impact of government restrictions on population mobility requires
a contact scaling matrix for lockdown levels 1 to 5. However, as described in Section 5.1,
Level 1 and Level 4 lockdowns have not been used to date (and hence not observed), while
Level 3 and Level 5 lockdowns were used twice but with modifications on each of the second
occasions. Moreover, seasonal shifts in social dynamics (for example, in December), may
play a role in the effectiveness of a given lockdown. Our chosen scaling estimates for
projection, based on supplementary Table S3, make a pragmatic best approximation. For
Level 0 (No Intervention), we use the ‘No intervention’ scaling from the fitted model;
Level 1 (unobserved) uses a linear interpolation of scalings from Level 0 and 2; Level 3
was enacted twice with slight changes the second time, but we use the scaling from the
October 2020 lockdown (‘Lockdown Level 3’); Level 4 was unobserved, so we use again a
linear interpolation, this time from Level 3 to Level 5; Level 5 was used twice, but similar
to Level 3 case, we use the scaling from November 2020 corresponding to ‘Lockdown Level
5’. The resulting scaling parameter estimates mapped to lockdown levels are presented
20

in Fig S3 in the supplementary material for completeness, and for reference we list values
in supplementary Table S4.
The SEIR model was projected from the 1st of February to 30th March 2021 (8
weeks) under different lockdown scenarios implemented in two 4 week chunks (the date
of the second lockdown implemented was 2nd March). Lockdown levels used for each four
week period are specified in Table 3. A forward projection is made by adopting the corresponding scaling of contacts from supplementary Table S4, with the SEIR system solved
forward in time. Projection uncertainty bounds are obtained by taking the bootstrap
replicate estimates of the corresponding scaling parameters and completing a forward
projection for each of these, with 2.5% and 97.5% sample quantiles of these projections
giving uncertainty bounds. Estimated daily economic costs are shown in the left panel of
Fig 8.

Table 3: Estimated cases, deaths and costs for the 8 week period between 1st February

2nd March. The observed number of cases in the given period was 15,334 for the Dublin
region. 95% intervals are given in parentheses.
During this time, Ireland was under Level 5 lockdown. This corresponds to our third
lockdown scenario above, though as can be seen in Fig 9, the projection underestimates
the true case count of 15, 334 that was observed during that period. In contrast, the upper
bound of our estimated number of daily cases during this period is approximately 7, 200.
This underestimation may be due to the public not treating this Level 5 as seriously as
22

the Level 5 intervention last year. A closer look at the actual case counts over that period
is given in the right panel of Figure 8, showing that cases plateaued after February 15th
oscillating around an average figure of 200 cases per day instead of falling. A comparison
across the different interventions of the total number of estimated cases for period 1st
February 2021 to 30th March 2021 is given in Appendix 7, Figure S4. Note: the ‘No
Intervention’ have been omitted from these graphs as the scale of the estimated cases is
substantially larger than the observed cases.

6.2

Projecting the impact of vaccination

As an ad-hoc proxy for the effect of vaccinations, we re-evaluated the SEIR model after
setting all contacts for people aged 70 and above to zero after 1st February 2021. The
symptomatic infectious rate from this model is shown in Figure 10. Estimated cases
and deaths for this scenario are given in Table 4. We estimated the 70 to 74 age class
death rate by proportionally splitting the rate for 65 to 74 age class from supplementary
Table S5. We see a large reduction of deaths due to the change in dynamics mimicking
successful vaccination, despite the number of cases not differing substantially. This is not
surprising since the 70+ age classes have considerably higher death rates.

Discussion

Our primary motivation in this article is the specification of a modelling framework that
attempts to answer the question of how best public health strategies can be weighed
against the attendant social and economic costs of such measures, with the recognition
that these strategies can have bigger impacts on different age groups. In this regard, we
have presented an age-structured SEIR model for the Irish epidemic that is generalisable
to an international context. Where feasible, the parameters of our model governing disease spread have been estimated from publicly available Irish epidemiological data with
a bootstrapping approach used to determine parameter uncertainties. Our fitted model

captures much of the structure observed in daily case numbers. Our approach allows for
local adaptions and calibrations of models in any region or location where such data is
available. We also present incidence projections under a number of hypothetical government intervention strategies, in conjunction with approximate economic costings allowing
for their consideration in the decision making process. This framework is easy to interpret and suitable for describing counterfactual scenarios, which could assist policy makers
with regard to minimising morbidity balanced with the costs of prospective suppression
strategies. We are not aware of any framework with this level of modelling detail that has
been presented to date.
However, there are a number of limitations to our present approach that provide
opportunities for substantial further refinements. These chiefly revolve around access to
sufficiently detailed public health and economic data which would provide an ability to
develop more complex models around social mixing, in addition to an ability to further
refine estimates of the parameters governing disease spread and economic costings. We
currently build upon the social interaction matrices provided by Prem et al. (2017) which
are confined to four social settings, where we model changes due to public mobility restrictions through a rescaling approach. However, with contact tracing for confirmed cases
being used as a control strategy in a number of countries, access to such data would
provide an avenue to substantially improve social mixing models, perhaps in conjunction
with carefully constructed large scale public mobility surveys. For example, we could expand the number of social mixing venues to more than four with a better understanding

24

on disease transmission settings. This would allow for incorporation of specific venues
such as bars or restaurants, as well as allowing matrix rescalings to depend on individual
age groups so that lockdown regimes have the potential to impact different age groups in
different ways.
Alternatively, we could model the sociability parameters using covariates to describe
the specific lockdown (e.g., schools open/closed, pubs open/closed, public events, restrictions in households etc.) rather than fixing these to have a constant value in a given
lockdown level. This would allow us to make comparisons between Level 5 and Level 5+
for example – a holiday period effect could be included as another covariate. It would
also allow us to construct new hypothetical lockdown regimes.
Another extension to our approach would be to incorporate uncertainty estimates
around the mechanistic parameters of the SEIR model. If one could obtain reasonable
uncertainty intervals on these parameters, one direction might be to use a central composite design scheme used in response surface construction (Box and Draper, 1987), based on
some transformation of these uncertainty intervals. However, such an approach would introduce a steep computational overhead and would require sufficient coding and hardware
solutions to enable a feasible (in time) implementation.

Supplementary material
A: Lockdown measures in Ireland
A more detailed overview of the government interventions over the course of the epidemic in Ireland from
what we define as day 0 of the epidemic, 28th February 2020, up to and including 31st January 2021. We
acknowledge that certain interventions were not eased for the whole indicated period but for the purpose
of simplification we are assuming they were.

Government Intervention
11/03/2020 No Intervention
26/03/2020 All schools and universities closed, followed by bars and
a ban on mass gathering (although there was a four day
delay between the schools closure and the closure of the
bars, we decided to treat it as the same period for simplification)
18/05/2020 A strict lockdown whereby all non-essential services and
industries were put on hold
07/06/2020 The first phase of the gradual easing of the strict lockdown
28/06/2020 The second phase of the gradual easing of the strict lockdown
17/08/2020 The third phase of the gradual easing of the strict lockdown
17/09/2020 Some level of restrictions was brought back, although
the government’s plan of living with COVID–19 and
the introduction of the 5 levels lockdown tiers was introduced later during this phase, the restrictions were
very similar to those of what the government now call
a Level 2 lockdown, hence we label the intervention implemented during this phase as a Level 2 lockdown.
20/10/2020 Level 3 lockdown
30/11/2020 Level 5 lockdown
18/12/2020 Level 3 lockdown, all non-essential retail, hairdressers,
gyms, leisure centres, museums, galleries, libraries, cinemas and places of worship were allowed to reopen.
Restaurants, gastropubs and hotel restaurants were allowed to provide indoor service.
03/01/2021 Holiday period, households were allowed to mix with
up to two other households and inter-county travel was
permitted.
30/01/2021 Level 5 lockdown, plus the closure of schools and the
construction industry.

B Next generation matrix
The next generation matrix encodes the spread of the disease as a linear operator whose form is determined
by the model.Diekmann et al. (1990) showed that (subject to light conditions) the dominant eigenvalue
of the next-generation operator can be interpreted as “the typical number of secondary cases”, or R0 . For
discrete state models such as ours, Section 2.2 of Heffernan et al. (2005) provides a practical explanation
of how to construct the next generation matrix. We go through the method here for our model.
Let z̃ = (z̃1 , . . . , z̃p ) be the vector of compartment sizes for compartments from which infected
individuals enter or leave (i.e, all except the susceptible and removed compartments). The entries of
z̃ are extracted from z as defined in Section 3 of the manuscript. Now introduce fi (z̃) as the rate of
new infections that enter compartment i, let vi+ (z̃) be the rate of individuals arriving into compartment
i who are not newly infected, let vi− (z̃) be the rate of individuals leaving compartment i, and finally
let vi (z̃) = vi− (z̃) − vi+ (z̃). With this notation, every system of equations described in section 3 can be
expressed as fi (z̃) − vi (z̃).
The next generation matrix is constructed from the matrices of partial derivatives of fi and vi ,
Fij =

∂fi
(z̃0 ),
∂ z̃j

Vij =

∂vi
(z̃0 )
∂ z̃j

(8)

evaluated at the disease-free equilibrium, z̃0 , i.e., the point at which no infection is present. In our
application, since we are imposing a constant population N , the disease free equilibrium simply means
that Si = Ni , i = 1, . . . , A and all other compartments equal 0. The next generation matrix Q is equal to
Q = F V−1

(9)

In our application, the F matrix can be expressed as a block matrix, where each block corresponds to an
age group

Since each block represents an age group, different parameters for different age can be easily incorporated
by simply altering the suitable block.
The largest absolute eigenvalue value of Q is R0 . Since β is easily factored out of the F matrix, the
b V−1 , where F = β F.
b
eigenvalue can be expressed as a product of β and the maximum eigenvalue of F
This means that if R0 is determined and β is desired, the expression can easily be re-arranged:
β = R0 /ξ
b V−1 .
where ξ is the maximum eigenvalue of F
