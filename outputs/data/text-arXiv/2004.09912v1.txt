This work presents a simple and realistic approach to handle the available data of COVID19 patients in India and to forecast the scenario. The model proposed is based on the
available facts like the onset of lockdown (as announced by the Government on 25th day, τ0
and the recovery pattern dictated by a mean life recovery time of τ1 (normally said to be
around 14 days). The data of infected COVID-19 patients from March 2, to April 16, 2020
has been used to fit the evolution of infected, recovery and death counts. A slow rising
exponential growth, with R0 close to 1/6, is found to represent the infected counts
indicating almost a linear rise. The rest of growth, saturation and decay of data is
comprehensibly modelled by incorporating lockdown time controlled R0, having a normal
error function like behaviour decaying to zero in some time frame of τ2 . The recovery mean
life time τ1 dictates the peak and decay. The results predicted for coming days are
interesting and optimistic. The introduced time constants based on experimental data for
both the recovery rate as well as for determining the time span of activity of R 0 after the
lockdown are subject of debate and provide possibility to introduce trigger factors to alter
these to be more suited to the model. The model can be extended to other communities
with their own R0 and recovery time parameters.
INTRODUCTION
While the world was entering into the new leap year 2020 with new objectives and targets,
Corona Virus took control over the world rather stealthy but quickly and strongly. Waking up
lethargically in the new year, we slowly had to accept the reality that most part this year was
an exceptional year of destruction without a blast. The new disease initiated during the fag
end of 2019, identified as COVID-19 virus infection was declared Pandemic by WHO on March
11, 2020 as it engulfed almost the entire globe in a span of a couple of months. Every day the
data throws more and more deaths, disease and helplessness with little hope of recovery. The
scale of death, misery, helplessness and negativity caused by the disease is monumental.
There is great deal of pessimism at this point of time. We don’t seem to know when and if
this will end and how. Therefore, during such times a convincing forecast based on acceptable
physical, data based arguments becomes necessary. This paper presents simple physical
model based on data to show how and when we will come over this pessimism. Though the
model proposed is India specific, but in quick time the results can be recalculated for any
country or community using the same source code.

Ever since a study on COVID 19 for India updates by Eili Klein et al[1] appeared on March 24,
2020, representing monumental scale of devastation in India through numbers of people,
there has been a great concern how to prepare for such a massive possible tragedy. The
alarming number of deaths predicted in this work motivated me to apply simple physical
methods of growth and decay to make a fresh assessment. Indeed simulation models many
times lack in insight and non-transparent making it difficult to find the control factors of the
real processes.
Recently, another interesting study by Matjaz et al [2] has present outlook for the United
States, Slovenia, Iran, and Germany. They show that the epidemic growth is a highly nonlinear process in the sense it matters what actions are taken by the Governments and so on.
It seems they dwell mostly on the available data for their forecasts. They assume recovery
time and mortality % for their predictions. There are other studies on similar lines [3-10]
expressing projections of this epidemic, including some theoretical analysis of epidemic
sometimes using statistical physics have been made in the past [11-15]. However, in our view,
there is dearth of research work which addresses simple issues and resolve them with
transparent logic.
It is clear that we have sufficient data of the epidemic growth of various communities and
countries. Most of this data shows exponential growth with a reproductive rate of growth
denoted by R0. The rate factor R0 has been found to be variable depending upon community
and Country. The other factors which can effectively reduce R 0 are lockdown and social
distancing and use of masks etc. The dynamics of R0 is one important key factors of this paper.
The other factors are the onset of lockdown and the rate of recovery. The 3 factors which
control the flattening and decay of the evolution of infected number of persons are judiciously
described based on input and physical arguments.
THEORETICAL PROCEDURE
Since most of the data and details are well understood, therefore I straight away come to the
following theoretical procedure.
The basic eq. that dictates the number of infected persons N e (t) at a time t in an environment
which has a total population of N in an area A, assumed to have an average uniform number
density 𝜎0 = 𝑁/𝐴 is given by
𝑑𝑁𝑒
𝑑𝑡

=(

𝑑𝑁𝑒
𝑑𝑡

)

𝑅0

𝑑𝑁𝑒

−(

𝑑𝑡

)

𝜏

(1)

Where the net rate of increase of 𝑁𝑒 (𝑡) is decided by the increase through reproductive rate
number 𝑅0 and decrease by a ‘relaxation time’ 𝜏, which tries to restore the deviation in some
mean time 𝜏.
The first term in Eq.(1) depends on growth rate R and is given by
𝑑𝑁

( 𝑑𝑡𝑒 )

𝑅0

= 𝑅𝑁𝑒 ,

(2)

One important criterion which I introduce is that R is not a constant but depends on time, e.g
under lockdown conditions as and when imposed, R will tend to vanish in some time.
Similarly, the decay factor is like out of balance factor controlled by a recovery mean time,
𝑑𝑁

( 𝑑𝑡𝑒 ) =
𝜏

𝑁𝑒

(3)

𝜏

Thus combining these, the eq. 1 reduces to
𝑑𝑁𝑒
𝑑𝑡

=(R-1/ 𝜏)𝑁𝑒

(4)

This results in
𝑁𝑒 (𝑡) = 𝑁𝑒 (0)𝑒 (∫ 𝑅(𝑡)𝑑𝑡−𝑡/ 𝜏)

(5)

In eq. 5, the argument of exponential has to stay under an integral sign as it has not been
assumed constant. In our analysis, we assume R is a function surface number density σ which
keeps on fluctuating with time depending upon the movement of the number of people. For
coronavirus it is stated to be R=0, for σ≤1/4, i.e. when number of people separate themselves
by social distance of ≥ 2 meters. The number density keeps on fluctuating randomly if the
persons in the area are not static.
The fluctuations in σ are statistical in nature and cause R to vary even under lockdown
conditions. We assume therefore it legitimate to treat these variations to be like a Gaussian
or an error function in nature for t greater than t0 .
𝑅(𝑡) = 𝑅0 𝑒 − 𝛼(𝑡−𝑡0 )

(6)

where 𝑡0 is the time when lockdown is initiated, and α determines how quickly R goes to zero.
In our calculations, R is considered to be controlled by some time constant 𝜏2 assumed to be
close to the mean life time of virus, i.e. 𝜏1. However, it has to be adequately adjusted if the
conditions of lockdown are getting violated.
𝛼 = 1/𝜏2 2
The choice of α is therefore debateable and it can be profitably tailored to represent observed
behaviour. A typical time dependence of R is shown in Fig.1., where 𝜏2 = 14 days.

Fig. 1. Assumed time dependence of R after lockdown plotted using τ2=14 days as an
example

Finally, we arrive at the following eq for evolution of 𝑁𝑒
𝑡 −𝛼(𝑡−𝑡 )2
0 𝑑𝑡 −1/𝜏)

𝑁𝑒 (𝑡) = 𝑁𝑒 (0)𝑒 (𝑅0 ∫0 𝑒

(7)

Further, splitting in time domain when 𝑡 ≤ 𝑡0 ,
𝑁𝑒 (𝑡) = 𝑁𝑒 (0)𝑒 𝑅0 𝑡

(8)

And for 𝑡 > 𝑡0 ,
𝑡

(𝑅 ∫ 𝑒
𝑁𝑒 (𝑡) = 𝑁𝑒 (0)𝑒 𝑅0 𝑡0 𝑒 0 𝑡0

−𝛼(𝑡−𝑡0 )2 𝑑𝑡−1/𝜏)

(9)

Which is solved as,
𝑁𝑒 (𝑡) = 𝑁𝑒 (0)𝑒

𝑅0 𝑡0

𝑒

𝜋1
erf (√𝛼(𝑡−𝑡0 ))−(𝑡−𝑡0) /𝜏)
𝛼2

(𝑅0 √

(10)

Therefore Eqs. 8 and 10 are the end results in terms of mean life time. The constants 𝑁𝑒 (0)
and R0 are obtainable from the observed data points of the infected daily data.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The time τ0 has been defined as announced by the Government of India on 24 th March and
taken to be 25 days. The whole calculation is based on times 𝜏0 , 𝜏1 and , 𝜏2 . 𝑁𝑒 (0) and R0 as

fitted to 𝑁𝑒 𝑒 𝑅0 𝑡 of all available from the data as available upto 16th April 2020, as shown in
Fig.2, and as fitted ( 8.52 and 1/6, respectively). It is important to observe that active cases
which differ from infected by the number recovered or died, is not significantly lowered. The
fit of this curve is dictated by 1/6.36. The table I represents various input parameters used.

In Fig.2, the data as available[16] has been presented. This has been fitted to an exponential
growth in Fig.3. Fig 4 presents a fit of the active data. The death count fit is given in Fig 5.
Finally, the model based predicted curves are presented in Fig. 6.

corrected through mean half life ( in green).

As can be easily observed from Fig. 6, the observed data fits excellently to an exponential
growth but with a small rate of increase. The fit has been incorporated into an expected
evolution of infected number assuming a lockdown initiation. As R tends to zero, the number
saturates. Again, when recovery is introduced in mean half life of 50 days, we get a peaked
curve which may be a true picture, provided no new factors emerge. The initial recovery mean
life considered was 14 days which turned out to be too quick and did not match with the
recovery fit as one compares fit parameters of Ne and N a.
It may be noted that if we assume that the number of infected N e is underquoted as the tests
̃𝑒 which has been
are not conducted thoroughly, we can update these by finding an updated 𝑁
grown from the death data, we get a significantly enhanced data, as plotted in Fig. 7.

Using this data will raise the data in Fig.7 by a factor of 3, approximately.

In conclusion, the aim of this paper is to give new ideas to model such cases of infected
disease evolution. There may be possible objections to the choice of breadth of R after
lockdown. There are also additional factors which develop as some hotspots emerging. A
more realistic model needs to address these issues. However a new way to establish the data
based theoretical model gives a new idea with great insight into how the factors are
controlled and should be applied in most such studies instead of simulations where the
contact with the processes is lost.
