A BSTRACT
During an ongoing epidemic, especially in the case of a new agent, data are partial and sparse, also
affected by external factors as for example climatic effects or preparedness and response capability of
healthcare structures. Despite that we showed how, under some universality assumptions, it is possible
to extract strategic insights by modelling the pandemic trough a probabilistic Polya urn scheme. In
the Polya framework, we provide both the distribution of infected cases and the asymptotic estimation
of the incidence rate, showing that data are consistent with a general underlying process at different
scales. Using European confirmed cases and diagnostic test data on COVID-19 , we provided an
extensive comparison among European countries and between Europe and Italy at regional scale,
for both the two big waves of infection. We globally estimated an incidence rate in accordance with
previous studies. On the other hand, this quantity could play a crucial role as a proxy variable for an
unbiased estimation of the real incidence rate, including symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.

Introduction

On December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan,
Hubei (China). Due to the extensive spreading of the infection, on March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO)
declared it a pandemic [1]. Since then, more than 80 millions of confirmed cases and about 2 millions of deaths have
been reported worldwide. Just in Europe, confirmed and deaths have been respectively about 25 and 0.5 millions of
cases, mostly concentrated in Russia, France, Italy, U.K. and Spain. Since the outbreak of the pandemic many national
and international health organizations have collected daily data about the COVID-19 pandemic, although following
different policy-making in terms of specific informations provided, temporal and geographical aggregation of data and
efficiency of tests. For example, Spain, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden have provided only weekly data and few of
them have provided aggregated data on a small regional scale. There are also countries that started later to provide tests
or, in some cases, they didn’t report any data about performed tests (Albania, Moldova, Montenegro). Moreover, due
to the emergency caused by the ongoing epidemic, helplessness in detecting concurrent causes of death and, in some
cases, delays or corruptions in data reporting, have affected the database on regional and national level. Last but not
least, due to the excess load of the healthcare systems and to the unknown nature of the pathogen, direct counting of the
total number of infected patients (confirmed, asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic cases) is impeded [2, 3]. This leads
to a biased estimation of key indexes, as the case fatality rate (CFR) and the infection fatality rate (IFR) [4–6], usually
used during a pandemic to measure the lethality of the incipient infection. Due to the above limitations, performing a
rigorous analysis to assess the patterns of the epidemic, is difficult, mostly in the case of a new pathogen. Nevertheless,
despite the scarcity and uncertainty of the available data, a simple analysis of empirical curves of European confirmed
cases suggests some universality in the epidemic spreading. Multiple waves of infection and closed values of key

and European Countries
indexes [7–9] observed in countries under a wide social and geographical conditions, suggest the presence of distinctive
features of the infection according to same underlying process at different scales.
Here, we present an extensive analysis, of the COVID-19 pandemic spread, at national and regional scales, comparing
results from 37 European countries and 21 Italian regions, for both the two big observed waves of infection. We showed
that the dynamics of the COVID-19 susceptible-infection system can be appropriately modelled by a generalized Polya
urn scheme, previously used in epidemiology to model disease transmission for infectious diseases like SARS or
smallpox [10] and to implement more general transmission models [11]. The probabilistic Polya urn scheme [12, 13]
describes the stochastic process of drawing with reinforcement from an urn, a number of balls with two different colours
(here labelling healthy and infected cases) and it is able to explain important features of the COVID-19 pandemic’s
scenario. So far as is known, in the limit of long time, it directly provides, both the probability density function (PDF)
of infected cases and an estimation of the asymptotic composition ρ∞ of the urn.
In order to implement the Polya scheme, we applied a simplified multiple waves approach in which each wave of
infection is considered an independent process. For each selected wave, confirmed cases observations were used to fit
the Negative Binomial PDFs that govern the Polya drawings, for each selected country and region. We statistically
tested PDFs resulting from our fitting, obtaining about 74% of successful PDFs for European countries and about
64% for Italian regions, over both the waves of infection. Within the same wave, estimated parameters resulted very
close and consistent with some general underlying behaviour for a wide range of external conditions. As in mean field
approximation spirit, for each wave of the infection, and for each group of data (European and Italian) we assumed
the same initial conditions and the same constant reproduction number. As a consequence, both national and regional
data can be considered as independent series of trials related to the same process at different scales. This enabled us to
estimate the asymptotic composition ρ∞ of the urn, as the mean of the Beta PDF, which governs the limiting distribution
of the sample average of a Polya process. In order to estimate the Beta PDF we used the time series of the empirical
ratio between the cumulative number of confirmed cases and the cumulative number of performed diagnostic tests. The
entire procedure has been repeated for both the two big infection waves of the pandemic, for each group of the European
countries and for each group of the Italian regions. The comparative results between European and Italian spread are
consistent with the assumption of universality stated for our procedure, enabling us to provide an asymptotic estimation
of the incidence rate (IR), by adopting ρ∞ as a global variable. The computed ρ∞ of confirmed cases represents a very
important feature in the pandemic dynamics, in that it could play a crucial role as a proxy variable to estimate the IR of
the total infected cases (symptomatic and asymptomatic) on the total susceptible population, hence the total number of
cases, which in turns represents a key value to get strategic information required for the public health policy-making
processes [14].

Methodology

Hereinafter, we described how the spreading of the COVID-19 infection can be ascribed to a contagion process based
on the Polya urn scheme. In its basic version, a single urn is considered, initially containing a number N of balls: w
white balls plus b black balls. A ball is drawn at random and then replaced together with a number d of balls of the
same color. The parameter d simulates the reproducibility number, it means the average number of people which are
infected when in touch with a sick person. The procedure is repeated n times, with n unlimited. In such a scheme it is
known that, for n → ∞ and large N , the probability mass function of drawing m white balls after the n-th draw can be
N
approximated by a Negative Binomial PDF NB(r, p), with parameters r = wd , and p = N +nd
[15]. Furthermore, once
denoting the process by the indicator function In (equal to 1 or 0 if the drawn ball is respectively white or not), the
fraction of the total number of white balls inside the urn after n-th draw can be written as:
ρ0 + nδZn
(1)
ρn =
1 + nδ
where δ =

N

being the normalized d, ρ0 =

is the initial fraction of white balls, and
n

(2)

is the sample average of the process. It can be proved that, setting θ = Nd − r, ρn and Zn are
 martingale, both
converging almost surely as n → ∞ to a random variable distributed according to a Beta B r, θ with a mean value
ρ∞ coinciding with the initial fraction ρ0 of white balls [16–18]. Note that the above parametrization explicitly links
the distribution of the random process with the distribution of its sample average.
The above properties can be extended to more general schemes: balls labelled with an arbitrary number of colors,
different replacement rules (d) [18], or different number m of drawn balls at once (multiple drawings) [19] and [20]. In
2

and European Countries

the latter case it can be also proved that the total fraction of white balls ρn are still converging to a random variables
with a Beta-like distribution. This supports the idea to describe confirmed cases data by a Polya process in whatever
time or geographical format they have been aggregated. In order to assure suitable conditions for implementing the
entire scheme, we need to set the assumptions and statements below. Hereafter we will use the apex g = E, I to label
quantities respectively related to the group of the European countries or the Italian regions and the apex ν = 1, 2 to
label quantities related to the first or the second waves of infection.
2.1

Assumptions and statement
1. We assume an ideal efficiency of the diagnostic tests, it means tests are 100% sensitive for detecting COVID-19
infections.
2. Regular and persistent features, common to many countries with different levels of disease severity, highlight
a general underlying dynamic of the spread of the disease. As for many countries, although with different
social and geographical conditions, the presence of different peaks observed in the curve of confirmed cases
(Fig.13) suggests to model the disease spread by multiple waves of infection, considering each of them as a
single independent infection process. We concentrated our analysis on the two biggest waves observed in most
of the considered countries.
3. We applied this multiple waves scheme describing each of the two waves by a single uni-modal distribution.
In order to separate dataset of each country we selected time intervals around the two highest peaks, whose
endpoints coincide with the lowest values before and after a peak. For practical calculation, we assume these
values represent respectively the onset and the close of a single wave of infection although in many cases the
there is an overlap between consecutive waves.
4. We restricted our analysis excluding abrupt change in dynamical conditions, and applying our procedures
to consecutive waves of infection. In other words, we assume the pandemic, after a finite time interval, has
exhausted its actual pathogenic load, due to natural causes or to containment rules adopted. This allows us to
deal with asymptotic quantities in the limit of large time t.

n,i and sn,i observations related respectively to the n-th daily number of confirmed case and
n-th daily number of performed diagnostic test for the i-th European country (g = E and i = 1, ..., 37 )
or for the i-th Italian region (g = I and i = 1, ..., 21) during the first (ν = 1) or second (ν = 2) wave of
infection.Identifying the white balls with the variable cg,ν

6. We applied our procedure separately to the set of national data and to the regional one so as to analyse and
compare the spreading of COVID-19 at different scales in terms of number of population and geographical
size. We repeated the procedure for the first and the second wave of infection.
7. Based on the assumption 2, we assumed that, for each wave of infection, the group of European countries
was approximately in the same local conditions: actually they have approximately the same initial ratio
E,ν
between infected and susceptible cases (ρE,ν
0,i ' ρ0 ), and the same normalized reproduction number

(δi ' δ E,ν ), independently from the i-th considered country. This implies that, for large n, since we can

Infection rate estimation based on universality assumptions

For our calculations confirmed cases and diagnostic tests data of the 37 accessible European countries were collected
from 24 February 2020 to 30 January 2021. Data have reported by Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) database [21],
that provides national data worldwide. For the Italian case, we consider all the 21 regions using data provided by the
Italian Civil Protection Agency (CPA) database [22] on daily time scales. Under the above assumptions we fitted the
NB(rig,ν , pg,ν
i ) PDFs for each of the 37 European selected countries and for each of the 21 Italian regions. For properly
selecting observations for each wave of infection and for each country, we proceeded as described in assumption 3. In
most of the countries, a multiple waves path is recognizable from daily confirmed cases curve. Although shifted by a
time delay, all confirmed cases curves show a first isolated wave followed by a second or a third big wave overlapping
each other and a number of smaller peaks that seem to be not ascribable to random fluctuations. We consider only
the two biggest waves, locating the onset and close points simply considering the minima around each peak. The
maximum likelihood estimation algorithm was used to compute the fitting parameters rig,ν and pg,ν
. For practical
i
calculation, we adopted the fitdist function implemented in Matlab, training the models with the confirmed cases
data cg,ν
n,i . In order to select PDFs that successfully fit confirmed cases data, we performed both Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS-test) and Chi-square test (χ2 -test) using respectively the kstest and the chi2gof Matlab functions. As a result,
over both the two waves, we were able to select a subset of European countries (about 74% of successful PDFs) and
a subset of Italian regions(about 64% of successful PDFs) that passed both the tests. To assess the validity of our
procedure we must to justify the assumption 7. To this aim, we first computed sample means and variances of the
g,ν
g,ν
estimated parameters rig,ν (µg,ν
) and pg,ν
( µg,ν
r and σr
p and σp ), then, under normality assumption we statistically
i
g,ν
tested whether each variance σ∗ was significantly different from zero. A t-test was performed for each σ∗g,ν , using
ttest Matlab function. Successful results, from all of the performed tests, allow us to approximate rig,ν and pg,ν
i ,
according to assumption 7 and accounting for universality stated in assumption 2 and 7. Once the distributions of
confirmed cases have been proved, the problem
of estimating the asymptotic value ρ∞ reduces to compute the mean of

the asymptotic distributions B rg,ν , θg,ν . In fact, according to assumption 8, for each waves, we can consider data
from each European country, or Italian region, as i different sequences of trials of a process with different population
but characterized by the same Beta PDF. This implies
 that, for each group g and for each wave of infection ν, we can
g,ν
assume Rn,i
are governed by the same B rg,ν , θg,ν . As a result we were able to fit the four Beta PDFs by using the
g,ν
g,ν
set of the i limiting values R∞,i
= limn→∞ Rn,i
(see Fig.14-15). A cut-off value has been also introduced to establish
g,ν
a finite size convergence criterion. However, in most of the cases R∞,i
were obtained directly by the ratio computed
on the end points of each waves of infection, since they can be considered far enough to represent the limit for large
g,ν
times, where the stability of Rn,i
is reached. Also in this case, maximum likelihood estimation algorithm and fitdist
function was adopted to estimate the parameters rg,ν and θg,ν , for each Beta PDFs. KS-test and χ2 -test were also
successfully conducted to assess the performance of the estimated Beta.
 In order to assure the consistency of the whole
procedure we tested whether each rg,ν , estimated by B rg,ν , θg,ν , was significantly different from respective µg,ν
r
estimated by NB(rig,ν , pg,ν
i ). For each group g and each wave of infection ν we implement a one-sample two tailed
t-test, under the null hypothesis µg,ν
= rg,ν . A two-sample two tailed t-test to simultaneously compare couples of µg,ν
r
r
with crossed g and ν suggesting the invariance of rg,ν under change of ν or g and similarity behaviour at different
scales. Finally an estimation of the mean value ρg,ν
∞ was obtained. All results are provided in the next sessions.

Results
European countries

For our calculation we restricted to the countries with total population grater than one million, selecting 40 of the 48
countries from European continent, reported in the HDX database (see Tab.1-2). We also discarded countries that
did not provide diagnostic test data at all (Albania, Montenegro, Moldova). We preprocessed remaining 37 European
countries, first removing inconsistent data (outliers and negative data) than selecting only observations corresponding to
performed diagnostic tests. Wherever possible, data were collected on daily time scale, otherwise we smoothed weekly
g,ν
data, cg,ν
n,i and sn,i , as in the case of Germany, Spain, Netherlands, France and Ukraine. Due to different starting day of
the pandemic, delays or corruptions in data reporting, four countries (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechia, North Macedonia )
did not provided sufficient data for the first wave of infection. As a result, we obtain two sets composed by 33 countries
for the first wave and by 37 for the second wave. Fitting procedures were applied on the above two groups and both

KS-test and χ2 -test with a confidence level α = 0.01, were performed to select successful PDFs, whose p-values
were reported in Tab.1-2. Resulting i = 27 successful NB(riE,1 , pE,1
i ) PDFs for the first wave are showed in Fig.1-3,
where we reported fitted PDFs (Fig.1) and their relative CDFs (Fig.2-3). The same procedures were performed for the
E,ν
second wave (Fig.4-6) obtaining i = 28 successful NB(riE,2 , pE,2
and pE,ν
of all successful
i ). Fitting parameters ri

PDFs were reported in Tab.1-2 (first wave) and Tab.4-5 (second wave). In Fig.2-3 and Fig.5-6, is also reported the
graphical comparison between fitted CDFs and empirical distribution functions, computed with a 95% confidence

interval (% c.i.). By using the successful subset of data we computed sample means and variances (µE,ν
and
r , σr
E,ν
E,ν
µp , σp ). Excluding the two outliers values coming from Ukraine and Poland, for the first wave, we obtained
µE,1
= 1.48 (95% c.i.: 1.34 − 1.62) and µE,1
= 3.17 · 10−2 (95% c.i.: 2.06 · 10−2 − 4.28 · 10−2 ) (see Tab.3). Similar
r
p
results were obtained for the second wave: µE,2
= 1.68 (95% c.i.: 1.54 − 1.82) and µE,2
= 0.04 · 10−2 (95% c.i.:
r
p
−2
−2
0.03 · 10 − 0.05 · 10 ). For each wave of infection we assessed the sharpness of the normal distributions riE,ν
and pE,ν
0 by using two one-sample two-tailed t-tests, with a significance level α = 0.05, under the null hypothesis
i
that respectively σrE,ν = 0 and σpE,ν = 0. All tests were successful, with a p-values within the interval (0.08 - 0.6).
Focusing on parameters riE,ν we also note that µE,1
is very closed to µE,2
within the c.i., suggesting it is invariant
r
r
also under change of the wave ν considered. In order to verify the latter hypothesis (µE,1
= µE,2
r
r ) a two-sample
two-tailed t-test, with a significance level α = 0.05, was also performed with success, by using ttest2 function, and
obtaining a p-value 0.09. On the contrary, concerning, the sample means µE,ν
they can’t directly compared with a
p

target value since the parameters pE,ν can’t be directly estimated from B rg,ν , θg,ν . On the other hand, µE,ν
strongly
p
decreases passing from the first wave to the second one. The deviation observed can be due by different values of d
trough δ E,ν : increasing values of δ E,ν imply decreasing value of pE,ν
and of the relative sample means µE,ν
p . All these
i
results support our assumptions (2 and 7-9) although a more detailed analysis is prevented since δ g,ν cannot be directly
E,ν
estimated from pg,ν
or θg,ν . Once the convergence of Rn,i
was reached, for each selected country, asymptotic values
i

E,ν
E,ν E,ν
of the ratio R∞,i were used to fit the two Beta PDFs B r , θ
, (see Fig.7). KS-test and χ2 -test were successfully
E,ν
E,ν
performed on both the distributions. Fitting parameters r
and θ
related to the Beta distributions were estimated
and reported in Tab.3. We found a value of 1.80 (95% c.i.: 1.07 − 3.02) for rE,1 and 1.95 (95% c.i.: 1.10 − 3.46)
for rE,2 , showing that, within the c.i., rE,ν are consistent with the sample means obtained from estimated Negative
Binomials. In order to complete the comparison between parameters satisfying the initial condition in assumption
7-9, a two one-sample two-tailed t-tests were conducted, testing the null hypothesis that respectively µE,1
= rE,1 and
r
E,2
E,2
µr = r . Both tests passed successfully with a p-value respectively equal to 0.6 and 0.1. Finally we computed
E,ν
expected values ρE,ν
(Tab.3). We obtained a value ρE,1
∞ = ρ0
∞ = 0.05 (95% c.i.: 0.03 − 0.07) for the first wave and
E,2
ρ∞ = 0.11 (95% c.i.: 0.08 − 0.14) for the second one. Both results seem in good agreement with the observations
provided worldwide for the incidence rate on monthly scale [ECDC] and the deviation between the two values accounts
for the observed growing of the incidence rate passing from the first to the second wave of infection. Moreover, since
parameters rE,1 and rE,2 are very close the different values resulting from incidence rate estimations ρE,ν
∞ , are mainly
due by parameters θE,ν , which pass from θE,1 = 34.92 (95% c.i.: 21.08 − 57.46) for the first wave to θE,1 12.86 (95%
c.i.: 6.07 − 27.02) for the second one. A decreasing θE,ν means an increasing δ E,ν , which corresponds to an increasing
d, the population number being constant. This could be explained by an increasing viral load, conceivably due to
the inflow of a more aggressive variant of the virus, associated with an increasing initial sick population w, since the
parameter rE,ν is proved to remain constant varying ν.

Italy

The entire procedure described above for the European case was repeated for the 21 Italian regions, in particular the
sequence of statistical tests with the same significance levels. Fig.8-11 show 14 and 13 successful Negative Binomials
PDFs and CDFs, corresponding to the selected regions during respectively the first and the second wave of infection.
Tab.4-5 report the estimated fitting parameters, for both the two waves. Sample means and variance of rI,ν and pI,ν

were estimated obtaining the following results: µI,1

two-tailed t-tests on both the variances were successfully performed. Two one-sample two-tailed t-tests for comparing

µI,1
and consistent with the European
∗ and µ∗ were also successfully performed. Results seem internally consistent

scenario. However, parameters rI,ν and θI,ν , estimated by the B rI,ν , θI,ν , show some deviation from European
case that need to be discussed. In fact, while rI,1 value can be still considered in agreement with previous results,
rI,2 is clearly far from all respective value changing g or ν. Nevertheless, a look to the Tab.6 shows that values of
I,2
ρI,1
∞ = 0.04 95% c.i. (0.02 − 0.06) and ρ∞ = 0.07 95% c.i. (0.05 − 0.09) seems in agreement respectively with the
first and second waves related to the European case. Actually the reason why the strong differences between values
of rI,2 estimated from the corresponding Beta and the mean values of riI,2 obtained from the single regions, must be
sought in that a small amount of data are available. Moreover, similarly to the European case (Fig.15), in the second
I,2
wave the ratio Ri,n
have not reached yet stable values. Crossed t-tests, as described in the European case were also
performed comparing all corresponding Italian and European estimated parameters with successful results.

Conclusion

Guided by heuristic evidence of some universality property, here we propose to describe the spread of (SARS-CoV-2)infected pneumonia (COVID-19) within a probabilistic Polya urn scheme. Under general homogeneity assumptions on
initial conditions and applying a multiple waves approach, we analysed European data reported on confirmed cases
and diagnostic test performed. A comparative analysis at regional and national scales was performed showing the
presence of distinctive features according to the same underlying process at different scales. general characteristics
can be extracted. Specific patterns and key indicators slightly depend from social or geographical conditions. On the
other hand some parameter seem to hold universality properties, properly identifying COVID-19 infection. A sequence
of statistical tests were performed to prove our hypothesis. Based on test results, for each wave of infection, we were
able to consider data from each European country, or Italian region, as i different sequences of trials of a process with
different population but characterized by the same distribution for its sample average. This allows us to estimate the
incidence rate ρ∞ by the asymptotic mean of the sample average of the process. Resulting estimation of ρg,ν
∞ , related to
the first and second wave of infection for the Italian case are broadly in line with European one and in agreement with
real observations [23].
