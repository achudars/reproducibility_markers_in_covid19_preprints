Abstract
Motivated by the current Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which is due to the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the important problem of forecasting daily deaths and cumulative
deaths, this paper examines the construction of prediction regions or intervals under the Poisson
regression model and for an over-dispersed Poisson regression model. For the Poisson regression
model, several prediction regions are developed and their performance are compared through
simulation studies. The methods are applied to the problem of forecasting daily and cumulative
deaths in the United States (US) due to COVID-19. To examine their performance relative
to what actually happened, daily deaths data until May 15th were used to forecast cumulative
deaths by June 1st. It was observed that there is over-dispersion in the observed data relative to
the Poisson regression model. An over-dispersed Poisson regression model is therefore proposed.
This new model builds on frailty ideas in Survival Analysis and over-dispersion is quantified
through an additional parameter. The Poisson regression model is a hidden model in this
over-dispersed Poisson regression model and obtains as a limiting case when the over-dispersion
parameter increases to infinity. A prediction region for the cumulative number of US deaths
due to COVID-19 by July 16th, given the data until July 2nd, is presented. Finally, the
paper discusses limitations of proposed procedures and mentions open research problems, as
well as the dangers and pitfalls when forecasting on a long horizon, with focus on this pandemic
where events, both foreseen and unforeseen, could have huge impacts on point predictions and
prediction regions.

Introduction

The current Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic [12], caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is
providing statisticians, data scientists, machine learners, and other modelers a real-time laboratory
to test and demonstrate their forecasting skills and abilities, with the quality of their forecasts assessable in a matter of days, weeks, or months. See, for instance, https://covid19-projections.com
from the Masachussetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Institute of Health Metrics (IHME)’s
https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america based at the University of Washington in
Seattle, as well as [15] discussing the complexities of modeling pandemics. Of particular interests
are the forecasting of the numbers of daily cases1 , deaths, and hospitalizations, or the cumulative
cases, deaths, and hospitalizations attributable to COVID-19 at a future date in a specified country
or a locality (e.g., a county, state, or province) on the basis of currently observed cases, deaths, and
hospitalizations data. Such forecasts are of critical importance since they are major components
in the decision-making process by government officials, business leaders, and educational and university administrators regarding the termination of lockdowns, lessening of social distancing and
other mitigation regulations, opening of businesses, or continuing with online class formats in K-12
schools, colleges, and universities.
The left panel of Figure 1 provides the daily number of reported deaths due to COVID-19 for the
United States (US) with respect to the number of days since December 31, 2019 until May 15, 2020,
which is Day 137 in the figures, as reported by the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC)
[11] [see Section A.1]. For a given date/day, including weekends, in the data set, the numbers
reported are from the preceding day, which is due to a processing lag in reporting. The right panel
of Figure 1 is a scatterplot of the cumulative number of deaths in the US due to COVID-19. Given
these daily and cumulative deaths data set, it is of interest to forecast the number of cumulative
deaths in the US by, say, May 25, 2020 (corresponding to Day 147), which is Memorial Day, and to
ask whether by that day the cumulative number of deaths in the US due to COVID-19 will have
surpassed the ominously depressing and grim milestone of 100,000 cumulative deaths. Later, for
our illustration, we will consider the problem of forecasting the cumulative number of deaths in
the US due to COVID-19 at the end of May 2020, and compare our forecast with what eventually
occurred. Finally, we attempt to forecast the cumulative number of deaths by July 16th based on
the data on July 2nd.
Such forecasting problems are clearly non-trivial since there is the distinct possibility that
whatever model we had fitted in the observed time-frame may not apply to the time period under
forecast, the ever-present danger and risk of extrapolation. Aside from the fitted model most likely
not being the true data generating model – recalling the aphorism attributed to George E. P.
Box [7] that all models are wrong, but some are useful – there are other factors, some beyond our
control, that could impact the number of reported deaths at a future time, such as premature easing
of social distancing and re-opening of business establishments, virus mutations, better diagnostic
tools, changing hotspots, overburdened health care facilities, introduction of effective treatments,
beneficial or detrimental actions by local, state, and/or federal entities, changing definition deaths

COVID-19 cases include confirmed and probable cases (infected people) and deaths according to a statement by
the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) issued on April 5, 2020. See [27].

due to COVID-19, under- or over-reporting of deaths, timely development of a vaccine, protests and
riots arising from social unrests, and others. But high-level decision-makers such as government
officials, business leaders, educational administrators, and society itself, demand some beacon,
however dim such beacons may be, to guide them in their decision-making. Statisticians, data
scientists, machine learners, and other modelers are always ready and willing to provide such
beacons.
This paper is in this spirit. We will examine existing methods and develop new methods for
constructing prediction regions for random variables that pertain to the number of occurrences
of an event of interest. A prediction region contains more information compared to just a point
prediction since it provides information about the uncertainty inherent in the prediction. Note that
with a prediction region we are interested in the would-be realized value of a random variable, not
the value of a parameter, hence instead of referring to it as a confidence region, it is instead called
a prediction region. The events of particular interest are those that are ‘rare’ in the sense that,
informally, the probability of an event occurring in an infinitesimal interval is also infinitesimal.
Consequently, our starting point will be the Poisson distribution which is a model for the number
of occurrences of a rare event, and transition to the more general Poisson regression model, and
eventually to an over-dispersed Poisson regression model which turns out to be a better model in
the COVID-19 application. The real-life and practical application for which our methods will be
applied is the construction of prediction regions for the daily and cumulative number of deaths due
to COVID-19 in the US for a future date given only the daily deaths data until a current date.
Note that such predictions or forecasts could probably be improved by utilizing other information
(such as the capacities of health care facilities; movements of people in a region; information about
sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests; transmission rates (R0 ) of the virus; and others), or
via stratification by states, cities, or counties and then combining the results from these strata
to obtain a point prediction and a prediction region for the whole US. However, we approach the
construction of the prediction regions for the daily and cumulative deaths at a future date by
just utilizing the observed reported daily deaths data for the whole US, which in a sense is the
3

most reliable available data regarding this COVID-19 pandemic. It might be possible to utilize
information about the number of cases or infected individuals, which is also reported daily, but we
feel that this is not a reliable information since it is highly dependent on the number of tests that
are performed and on the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tests used. In addition, if
such information is to be used in the prediction model, then we may not have their realized values
at the future date on which the prediction region is desired. We point out that even though we are
employing probabilistic models in the form of the Poisson or an over-dispersed Poisson model, which
are derivable from intuitive conditions when dealing with rare events (cf., [23, 16]), our prediction
method is still purely data-driven being only reliant on the observed data.

Poisson Model

The occurrence of a death due to COVID-19 could still be considered as a rare event when viewed
in the context of the whole population, though even if it is rare, deaths are still significant and dire
events. This is because to die of COVID-19, generally one first needs to get infected, which at this
point is still a rare event, and then having been infected, to die from it. The rate of dying when
infected with COVID-19, if not age-adjusted, is still rather low, less than 2% (see, for instance,
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Mortality Rate). Because of its rarity, a plausible probability model for
the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is therefore the Poisson model whose probability mass
function (PMF) is given by
exp(−λ)λk
p(k|λ) =
I{k ∈ Z0,+ }
(1)
k!
with Z0,+ = {0, 1, 2, . . .}, and λ > 0 is the rate parameter, which is also the mean and variance of
the distribution, and I{·} is the indicator function. For a variable Y with this Poisson distribution,
we write Y ∼ P OI(λ). The cumulative distribution function of a P OI(λ) is
X
P (w|λ) = Pr{Y ≤ w|λ} =
p(k|λ)I{w ≥ 0}.
(2)
{k∈Z0,+ : k≤w}

We start our investigations with this no-covariate Poisson model, equivalently, a model with intercept only, since results for the Poisson regression model build on this no-covariate model.

2.1

Prediction Regions when Rate λ is Known

Suppose now that Y0 ∼ P OI(λ), where for the moment we assume that we know the rate parameter
λ. A 100(1 − α)% prediction region for Y0 is a subset Γ(λ, α) ⊂ Z0,+ such that
X
Pr{Y0 ∈ Γ(λ, α)|λ} =
p(k|λ) ≥ 1 − α.
(3)
k∈Γ(λ,α)

Note that this region will not be an interval being a subset of Z0,+ , though if this region is formed
as the intersection between Z0,+ and an interval in <, then we may call it imprecisely as an interval.
Subject to this condition, a desirable property of such a region is that its cardinality is as small as
4

possible. If we allow for Γ(λ, α) to depend on a randomizer U , a standard uniform random variable
independent of Y0 , the smallest cardinality 100(1 − α)% prediction region is, using a NeymanPearson Lemma type argument, given by
o
[n
\
Γ0 (U ; λ, α) = A(λ; c(α))
{U ≤ γ(α)} a(λ; c(α)) ,
(4)
where, for d ∈ <, we define the subsets of Z0,+ given by
A(λ; d) = {k ∈ Z0,+ : p(k|λ) > d} ;
a(λ; d) = {k ∈ Z0,+ : p(k|λ) = d} ,
and c(α) and γ(α) determined via
c(α) = inf {d ≥ 0 : Pr{Y0 ∈ A(λ; d)|λ} ≤ 1 − α} ;
(1 − α) − Pr{Y0 ∈ A(λ; c(α))|λ}
γ(α) =
,
Pr{Y0 ∈ a(λ; c(α))|λ}
with 0/0 = 0. Observe that by allowing randomized prediction regions, we have
Pr{Y0 ∈ Γ0 (U ; λ, α)|λ} = 1 − α.
If we do not admit randomized prediction regions, which is achieved by always taking U = 0 in
Γ0 (U ; λ, α), then unless 1 − α is a ‘natural’ prediction coefficient, we will not achieve equality in
the preceding probability statement. The use of the adjective ‘natural’ is analogous to its use in
constructing nonparametric confidence intervals, cf., [21]. See [19] on the application of NeymanPearson-type arguments to construct optimal confidence regions, which could be adapted to the
construction of prediction regions.
There are two other ways of constructing prediction intervals for Y0 when λ is large using normal
approximations. To obtain the prediction regions, these intervals are then intersected with Z0,+ .
Letting N (µ, σ 2 ) denote a normal distribution with mean µ and variance σ 2 , we recall that when
λ is large owing to the Central Limit Theorem and the Delta Method (cf., [8]), then we have the
normal approximations

Consequently, when λ is large, the regions Γ0 (U ; λ, α) and Γ1 (λ, α) should be close to each other.
For these prediction regions Γ0R (randomized), Γ0N (nonrandomized), Γ1 , and Γ2 , the exact
coverage probabilities and their exact lengths (mean length for Γ0R ) could be computed under the
P OI(λ) distribution, since λ is known. Note that the lengths, which are the differences between the
upper and lower integer limits of the prediction regions, are equivalent surrogates of the cardinalities
of the regions. Figure 2 depicts the exact coverage probabilities (CP), expressed in percentages, and
their lengths (expected length for Γ0R ), for different values of λ. Except when λ takes small values

where the coverage probabilities of Γ1 and Γ2 are degraded, especially for the latter, the performance
of these prediction regions are quite similar. The coverage probability of Γ0R is exactly equal to
1 − α, whereas that for Γ0N is always at least equal to 1 − α. Both Γ1 and Γ2 could have coverage
probabilities that could be below the nominal coverage level, though as λ increases, these differences
become negligible. By construction, Γ0R has a shorter interval than Γ0N ; for some values of λ, the
length of Γ0R exceeds that of Γ1 and Γ2 , but this is because the coverage probabilities of Γ1 and
Γ2 are lower than the nominal coverage level.

2.2

Prediction Regions when Rate λ is Unknown

But, in the preceding developments, we have assumed that the rate parameter λ is known, an
unrealistic assumption. How do we deal with the situation when λ is unknown? Suppose that
we had observed a realization y = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ) of a random sample Y = (Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yn ) from
6

P OI(λ), so the components of Y are independent and identically distributed (IID) from P OI(λ).
Our goal is to utilize y to construct a 100(1 − α)% prediction region for an unobserved Y0 , which
is independent of Y and whose distribution is also P OI(λ). How will we achieve our goal? Note
that through the Sufficiency
Principle, we may reduce the problem by simply assuming P
that we
P
had observed t = ni=1 yi , the realization of the sufficient statistic for λ given by T = ni=1 Yi ,
which has a P OI(nλ) distribution. The reduced problem therefore is that we have (T, Y0 ) which are
independent random variables with T ∼ P OI(nλ) and Y0 ∼ P OI(λ) and our goal is to construct
a 100(1 − α)% prediction region Γ̃(T, U ; α) for Y0 , which utilizes T , and possibly a randomizer U
which is independent of (T, Y0 ).
Given T = t, the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of λ is λ̂(t) = t/n. By virtue of the
consistency of λ̂(T ) for λ as n → ∞, a seemingly straight-forward approach to constructing a
prediction region for Y0 is to replace λ in Γ0 (U ; λ, α), Γ1 (λ, α), and Γ2 (λ, α) in (4), (5), and (6),
respectively, by λ̂(t) to obtain
Γ̃0 (T, U ; α) = Γ0 (U ; λ̂(T ), α);

(7)

Γ̃1 (T ; α) = Γ1 (λ̂(T ), α);

(8)

Γ̃2 (T ; α) = Γ2 (λ̂(T ), α).

(9)

How do these prediction regions compare with each other in terms of performance, both in the
context of their coverage probabilities and also their cardinalities, whose surrogate are lengths? In
particular, by substituting λ̂(T ) = T /n for λ, how does this impact the coverage probabilities of
these prediction regions and are they still valid, even in an asymptotic sense?
It is not clear how the substitution of λ by λ̂(T ) = T /n will impact the exact performance of
the first prediction region Γ̃0 . However, for the second and third prediction regions Γ̃1 and Γ̃2 ,
we could alter them to take into account the substitutions, provided that λ is large. As noted
earlier, when λ is large, Γ̃0 ≈ Γ̃1 , so the alteration of Γ̃1 should also apply, approximately, to Γ̃0 .
The change in distributions of the pivotal quantities arising from these substitutions are reflected
below, a consequence of the Delta-Method.

From these normal approximations, we could improve the prediction intervals Γ̃1 and Γ̃2 into the
following prediction intervals, which take into account the impact of these substitutions where, for
notational economy, we write λ̂ for λ̂(T ) and ‘∨’ for max; de for the ceiling function; and bc for the

(10)
(11)

Note that by intersecting the intervals with Z0,+ , the floor and ceiling functions are actually not
needed, but we retain them in the formula since when we consider the ‘length’, this pertains to
the length of the interval. Observe that if the lower limits of these intervals are not zeros, which
7

will usually be the case for large λ, then it is a simple exercise to show that these two prediction
intervals have the same lengths, but they are not identical regions.
In trying to adapt the prediction region Γ0 (U ; λ, α) in (4) to the situation where λ is unknown, the main idea is to replace λ by an estimate obtained from the observed data. Doing
so leads to estimates of p(k|λ), k ∈ Z0,+ which are then used in determining c(α) and γ(α) in
(4). Thus, Γ̃0 in (7) is obtained by using the ML estimates of {p(k|λ), k = 0, 1, . . .} given by
{p(k|λ̂(n, t)), k = 0, 1, . . .} with λ̂(n, t) = t/n. This begs the question on whether other possible estimates of {p(k|λ), k = 0, 1, . . .} could be utilized which may have better performances than the use
of the ML estimates. An approach based on a second-order Taylor expansion adjusts p(k|λ̂(n, T ))
and leads to the approximation
p(k|λ) ≈ p̂3 (k; (n, t)) ≡

By using p̂3 (k; (n, t)) in place of p(k|λ) in (4) results in the prediction region denoted by Γ̌3 (n, t; α).
Another intriguing possibility is to utilize the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator
(UMVUE) (see [8]) of p(k|λ), given the data (n, T ) with T ∼ P OI(nλ), or equivalently, Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yn
which are IID P OI(λ). The UMVUE of p(k|λ), usually obtained through the Rao-Blackwell Theorem and Lehmann-Scheffe Theorem [8], is given by

the binomial probability at k with parameters (t, 1/n). Observe, however, that this approximation
will lead to zero probabilities for k outside of the set {0, 1, . . . , t}. Using p̂4 (k; (n, t)) in lieu of p(k|λ)
in (4) leads to the prediction region denoted by Γ̌4 (n, t; α).
As yet another idea is to develop a procedure by borrowing from the Bayesian playbook [8]. We
suppose that our prior knowledge of the value of the Poisson rate λ is represented by a distribution
function G. Having observed Y = y = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ), the posterior distribution of λ is given by
Rλ
exp{−nw}wt G(dw)
G(λ|y) = R 0∞

with t = t(y) = ni=1 yi . The conditional probability mass function of Y0 , given Y = y, also called
the posterior predictive PMF, is

If we are pure Bayesians, then we will completely know, or trust, our G, so we could use the
predictive PMF p(·|y; G) in lieu of the Poisson PMF in (4) to form a Bayesian prediction region for
Y0 . Usually, however, we may try to estimate G by a Ĝ(·; y) based on y. This brings us to the realm
of the Empirical Bayes (EB) approach, pioneered by Herbert Robbins; see [24, 25, 26]. An extreme
8

case is to ‘estimate’ G by a degenerate distribution at the ML estimate λ̂ = t/n, which leads to
just substituting λ̂ in the Poisson PMF, hence results in the prediction region Γ̃0 in (7). Another
possibility is to try to estimate G non-parametrically. However, here we implement this Bayesian
and EB approaches using a family of conjugate priors, so we assume G is a gamma distribution
with mean κ/β and variance κ/β 2 , denoted by Gκ,β , whose density function is
g(λ|κ, β) =

β κ κ−1
λ
exp{−βλ}I{λ > 0}
Γ(κ)

where κ > 0 and β > 0. Note that κ is the shape parameter and β is the scale parameter. Under
G = Gκ,β , simplifying (15) we obtain, for y0 ∈ Z0,+ ,
Γ(κ + t + y0 )
p(y0 |y; Gκ,β ) =

When κ is a positive integer, the PMF in (16) corresponds to a negative binomial distribution with
parameters κ + t and (β + n)/(β + n + 1). The PMF in (16) could be used in place of the Poisson
PMF in (4) to form a Bayesian prediction region for Y0 , given (κ, β), denoted by Γ̌5 (U, Y; (κ, β)).
An approach to specifying (κ, β) is to specify a prior mean and prior standard deviation for λ, say
M and S, respectively, which yield κ = M 2 /S 2 and β = M/S 2 . The EB approach estimates κ and
β from the data y = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ). Such estimation could be done via maximum likelihood using
the likelihood function obtained from the joint marginal distribution of (Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yn ) based on
the model Yi |λi ∼ P OI(λi ) and λi ∼ Gκ,β . This likelihood function is given by

A method-of-moments approach to estimating (κ, β) based on y fails, however, because negative
estimates of κ and β are obtained when the sample variance of y is smaller than its sample mean.
At this point we mention previous works dealing with prediction intervals under the Poisson
model. Prediction interval methods for the Poisson model have been incorporated in the R package envStats [17]. An object function in this package is predIntPois dealing with construction of
prediction intervals under the Poisson model. It provides four options for the type of prediction
interval to construct. The methods are based on procedures presented in [9, 13, 18]. The option normal.approx in predIntPois coincides with the prediction region Γ̃1 based on the normal
approximation. In these earlier procedures, randomization was not utilized, hence generally conservative prediction intervals are obtained. Other approaches for prediction interval construction
under the Poisson model, including Poisson regression models, are based on bootstrapping and
simulation techniques, hence are computationally-intensive [3].
To compare performance of the prediction regions Γ̃0 (randomized version), Γ̌1 , Γ̌2 , Γ̌3 , Γ̌4 , and
Γ̌5 with M = 50, S = 100, and for n ∈ {5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 70, 100} and λ ∈ {1, 5, 15, 30, 50, 100, 200},
we performed simulation studies, with program codes in the R [20] environment, to determine the
coverage probabilities and the lengths of the regions (recall that length is an equivalent surrogate
for the cardinality of the regions since we took the ceiling and the floor of the lower and upper
9

limits, respectively, for the intervals that leads to Γ̌1 and Γ̌2 ). For each combination of n and λ,
10000 simulation replications of the basic simulation experiment were performed. Table 4 in the
Appendix presents the results on the coverage percentages, mean lengths of the prediction intervals,
and standard deviations of the lengths for different values of λ. The basic simulation experiment
is, for a fixed nP
and λ, to generate T ∼ P OI(nλ) and Y0 ∼ P OI(λ). The T variable could be
viewed as T = ni=1 Yi where Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yn are IID from a P OI(λ), The prediction regions are
then constructed based on the observed (n, T ), with prediction coefficient of 95%. Note
P that since
Γ̌5 is the Bayes prediction region instead of the EB, we only needed the value of T = ni=1 Yi , but if
we also used the EB approach, then we would have needed the values of (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ) to estimate
(κ, β). After constructing the prediction regions, it is then determined if Y0 is contained in these
regions. Coverage percentage is the percentage out of the 10000 prediction regions that contain
the Y0 ; mean (standard deviation) length is the average (standard deviation) of the lengths of the
10000 prediction intervals. Figure 3 presents plots with respect to n of the coverage probabilities
(CP) and mean lengths (ML) for λ ∈ {1, 5, 30, 100}.
Examining Table 4 and Figure 3 we observe that when λ = 1, the CP of Γ̌2 is very poor and
even deteriorates as n increases. The reason for this is that the realized Y0 tends to equal 0, but the
square-root transformation has a tendency to shift to the right the prediction interval, hence the
interval tends to miss Y0 . This result for Γ̌2 is consistent with the result when the rate λ is known.
When n = 5, Γ̌3 and Γ̌4 have unacceptably lower CPs compared to the nominal level, while Γ̃0
also has CPs which are below the nominal level, as well as Γ̌1 and Γ̌5 , though the last two regions
have CPs closer to the desired level. The length of Γ̃0 tends to be shorter than Γ̌1 and Γ̌5 . As n
increases, the CPs of Γ̌3 and Γ̌4 get closer to the desired level, and their lengths tend to be a bit
shorter than Γ̃0 and Γ̌1 . When λ = 5, the CPs of Γ̃0 , Γ̌2 , Γ̌3 , and Γ̌4 are all below the nominal level,
whereas for Γ̌1 and Γ̌5 , their CPs exceed or are quite close to the nominal level, except when n = 5.
As a consequence, they ended up having longer mean lengths. These behaviors continue to hold
as λ was increased, but with the CPs getting closer to the nominal level, especially as n increases.
When n is small, the CPs of Γ̌3 and Γ̌4 are still appreciably lower than the nominal level. When
λ is large, Γ̌1 , Γ̌2 , and Γ̌5 almost have the same performance. Summing up our observations from
these simulation studies for this no-covariate or intercept only Poisson model, in terms of adapting
to the estimation of the unknown rate λ, Γ̌1 and Γ̌5 possess the best performance among these six
prediction regions in terms of achieving the nominal level, but they also tend to be longer than the
others.

Next, we consider the situation where there is a 1 × (p + 1) covariate vector x = (x0 , x1 , . . . , xp )
that could affect the rate parameter, where in our implementation we take x0 = 1, so the model
has an intercept component. Thus, we suppose that the rate parameter is λ(x; θ), where θ =
(θ0 , θ1 , . . . , θp )T is a (p + 1) × 1 vector of parameters. We further assume that there exists a non-

This is the so-called Poisson regression model and belongs to the class of generalized linear models
or the class of non-linear models [22, 8]. If Y0 , given x = x0 , has a Poisson distribution with rate
λ(x0 ; θ), and θ is known, then we could construct prediction regions for Y0 according to the methods
described in the first part of Section 2 when λ was assumed known.

3.2

With Unknown Parameter Vector

When θ is not known, then there is a need to estimate it. Let us therefore assume that we are
able to observe the sample {(Yi , xi ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n} with Yi |xi ∼ P OI(λ(xi ; θ)) and with the Yi s
independent and the xi s fixed. We seek to construct a prediction region for Y0 associated with the
covariate vector x0 . First, we introduce the following functions:

The associated score vector function is

[yi − ρ(xi θ)]xTi ψ(xi θ) = 0.

This will usually be obtained through iterative procedures, such as the iterative Newton-Raphson
method, with the iteration given by
θ ← θ + [I(θ)]−1 U (θ).

(22)

By the large-sample theory of ML estimation (cf., [8, 29]), as n → ∞ and under regularity conditions
on the sequence of covariate vectors xi , i = 1, 2, . . . , n, we have that


θ̂ ∼ AN θ, I(θ)−1 .
A consistent estimator of I(θ) is I(θ̂). By the Delta-Method, it then follows that the ML estimator
of λ(x0 ; θ) satisfies, as n → ∞,

where ‘tr’ means trace of a matrix.
Using this result and when λ0 = ρ(x0 θ) is large, we obtain the approximate distributions of
relevant pivotal quantities for constructing prediction regions. We write λ̂0 for λ(x0 ; θ̂) and ψ̂0 for
ψ(x0 θ̂). These pivotal quantities are:

Writing (Y, X) = {(Yi , xi ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n}, from these pivotal quantities, we are then able to obtain
approximate prediction regions for Y0 given by:

We could also have the prediction region based on Γ0 from Section 2 given by
Γ̃0 (U, x0 , (Y, X); α) = Γ0 (U ; λ̂0 , α),

(25)

where we note that the dependence on x0 and (Y, X) is through λ̂0 . Note, however, that we are
simply plugging in the estimate of λ(x0 ; θ), but without taking into consideration the variability
inherent in the estimator λ(x0 ; θ̂).
A specific inverse link function ρ(·), which we will consider in the application to forecasting
deaths in the US due to COVID-19, is the exponential function ρ(w) = exp(w), so that
•

ρ(w) = ρ (w) = ρ (w) = exp(w);

and

Ψ(w) = 0.

For this special inverse link function, we obtain the simplifications for the score vector and information matrices functions given by

We also mention the extension of the Bayesian/EB approaches to constructing prediction regions
in the regression setting. We suppose that the parameter θ in λ(x; θ) = ρ(xθ) takes values in a
parameter space Θ. The approach then proceeds by starting with a prior distribution Π(·) on
Θ which quantifies our prior knowledge about θ. The posterior predictive distribution of Y0 , the
response at x0 , given the data (Y, X) = {(yi , xi ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n}, is given by
p(y0 |x0 , (Y, X)) =

1 H[(Y0 , X0 )]
y0 ! H[(Y, X)]

(27)

where (Y0 , X0 ) = {(Yi , xi ), i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n} and
Z
i
n X
o hY
H[(Y, X)] =
exp −
ρ(xi θ)
ρ(xi θ)yi Π(dθ),

where the product and the sum are taken over the index set associated with (Y, X), so will be
over {1, 2, . . . , n} for (Y, X), and {0, 1, 2, . . . , n} for (Y0 , X0 ). Generally, there will be no family
of conjugate prior distributions on Θ with respect to the Poisson regression model, so the function
H will not be in a closed analytical form, so that it has to be computed numerically, for instance,
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Nevertheless, upon obtaining the posterior
predictive distribution of Y0 given in (27), a prediction region is then obtained by using this PMF
p(y0 |x0 , (Y, X)) in lieu of the Poisson PMF in (4), analogously to the development of the prediction
region Γ̌5 in the intercept only model. The prior distribution Π will involve hyper-parameters, for
example, if Θ = <p+1 , Π could be specified to be a multivariate normal distribution with mean
vector µ and covariance matrix Σ, so (µ, Σ) will be the hyper-parameters. For the Bayesian, these
hyper-parameters will be assigned values, unless an improper prior distribution (e.g., Lebesgue measure), which need not involve unknown hyper-parameters, is adopted; whereas, for the empirical
Bayesian, these hyper-parameters will be estimated using the data (Y, X). Because of the need to
approximate the posterior predictive PMF through numerical methods, these Bayesian and EB approaches to constructing a prediction region for Y0 are clearly computationally-intensive, especially
if used in a simulation study to investigate their properties, such as their coverage probabilities
and their lengths. Because of the need to specify a non-conjugate prior and its hyper-parameters
and the need for intensive computations, these Bayesian and EB procedures are not included in
the illustrations, simulations, and applications. It is clear, though, that they are highly viable
alternative procedures and should be further explored.

3.3

Illustrations of Prediction Regions

We demonstrate these prediction regions, depicted as intervals in the plots, via the following
experiment. We specify a sample size n and an order p. We then generate IID realizations
14

wi , i = 1, 2, . . . , n, n + 1, from either a N (µ, σ 2 ) distribution or a standard uniform distribution, and form the covariate vectors xi = (1, wi , wi2 , . . . , wip ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, n + 1. For a specified
θ = (θ0 , θ1 , . . . , θp )T , the Poisson rates
λi = λ(xi ; θ) = ρ(xi θ) = exp{xi θ}, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, n + 1.
are computed. The ith response yi is a realization of a random draw from a P OI(λi ). The
response vector is y = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn , yn+1 )T . The goal is to construct a prediction region for
Y0 ≡ Yn+1 , given the data {(yi , xi ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n} and x0 ≡ xn+1 . We construct 95% prediction
intervals Γ̃0 (U, x0 , (Y, X); .05), Γ̌1 (x0 , (Y, X); .05), and Γ̌2 (x0 , (Y, X); .05) in (25), (23), and (24),
respectively. The procedures were coded into R functions and these will be made available publicly
in due time. We present the results pictorially via a scatterplot of {(wi , yi ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, n + 1}.
The realized value y0 ≡ yn+1 of Y0 is highlighted and the three prediction intervals for Y0 are also
plotted. Included in the plot is the theoretical curve for the λ(x; θ) as a function of w and we also
super-impose the fitted curve. Prediction regions for Yi at wi , i = 1, 2, . . . , n, are also depicted in
the plot.
Figure 4 shows a realization for a model with n = 30, p = 1, with Wi ∼ U [0, 1], i = 1, 2, . . . , 31,
and with θ = (2, 3)T , so that λi = exp{2 + 3wi }, i = 1, 2, . . . , 31, a sharply and exponentially
increasing function of wi . The Y31 being predicted was at w31 = .8139 and the realized value
was y31 = 1222, which ended up being contained in all three realized prediction intervals Γ̃0 =
[1091, 1223], Γ̌1 = [1087, 1226], and Γ̌2 = [1088, 1227]. The second realization in Figure 5 is from
a model with n = 100, p = 2, and where Wi ∼ N (µ = 2, σ = 2), i = 1, 2, . . . , 101, and with
θ = (.3, −.2, .05). The value being predicted is at w101 = 5.0622 and the realized value of Y101
was y101 = 1. The three prediction regions were Γ̃0 = [0, 3], Γ̌1 = [0, 3], and Γ̌2 = [1, 4], which all
contained y101 . Two things to observe from this plot are (1) the prediction region Γ̌2 was shifted to
the right relative to Γ̌1 , and (2) the prediction regions Γ̃0 with respect to the w-values are scissorlike or jagged. The latter is a consequence of the randomization approach in the construction of the
prediction regions and this non-smooth behavior becomes more apparent since the realized values
of the Yi s are small. The third realization, depicted in Figure 6, is from a model with n = 200,
p = 3, with Wi ∼ N (µ = 1, σ = 2), and with θ = (3, .2, −.1, −.05). The rate curve λ(w) as a
function of w goes to zero as w increases, but goes to ∞ as w decreases, with a local minimum and
maximum close to w = −2 and w = 1, respectively. The target of the prediction regions was Y201
which took value y201 = 23 at w201 = −3.2509. The realized prediction regions were Γ̃0 = [10, 25],
Γ̌1 = [9, 26], and Γ̌2 = [10, 27], so all regions contained y201 = 23. Once again observe that Γ̌2 tends
to be shifted to the right relative to Γ̌1 . Figure 7 contains a realization from a model with n = 100,
p = 5, with Wi ∼ U [0, 1], i = 1, 2, . . . , 101, and with θ = (3, −1, 3, −2, 1, −.5). The rate curve is not
highly varying compared to that in the preceding model since w is restricted on [0, 1]. The target
is the value of Y101 , which turned out to be y101 = 29 at w101 = .8944. This realized value of Y101
was contained in the realized prediction regions Γ̃0 = [21, 42], Γ̌1 = [20, 42], and Γ̌2 = [22, 43].

Simulation Studies

In each of these illustrative realizations, the three prediction regions did not vary much from each
other in terms of their sizes, except in the first case where Γ̃0 was shorter but barely covered

the value being predicted. A question that now arises is how their coverage probabilities and
their mean lengths compare with each other? To gain some insights into these comparisons, we
performed simulation studies under the four different models described above, with each simulation
run having 10000 replications. The sample sizes considered were n ∈ {30, 50, 100, 200}. In the
Appendix, Tables 11, 12, 13 and 14 summarize the results of these simulations where we report the
coverage probabilities (CP), mean lengths (ML), and standard deviation of lengths (SL). Examining
these tables, it appears that Γ̃0 has coverage probabilities that are below the nominal level (between
3% and 4% below in Table 14 when n = 30), with the discrepancy being more pronounced when
the sample size is small. As the sample size is increased, these observed coverage probabilities get
closer to the nominal level. This deficiency is due to the estimation of the θ parameter and, as
previously noted, the Γ̃0 does not take into consideration the variability in the resulting estimator
of λ(x0 ; θ). On the other hand, Γ̌1 and Γ̌2 both achieve coverage probabilities that are quite close to
the nominal level, especially Γ̌1 , when n is large. Γ̃0 , on the other hand, tends to have a lower mean
length compared to the mean lengths of Γ̌1 and Γ̌2 , with the differences in mean lengths becoming
alarmingly large for the model in Table 13. Recall that for this model, the rate curve increases to
∞ as w decreases to −∞, and since the wi ’s are generated from a normal distribution, on some
occasions, wn+1 falls outside the range of {wi , i = 1, 2, . . . , n}. Depending on how different wn+1 is
from the mean of w1 , w2 , . . . , wn , this could lead to a large estimate of the standard error of λ̂n+1 ,
16

Figure 5: A realization with p = 2, n = 100, θ = (.3, −.2, .05), and with W ∼ N (µ = 2, σ = 2).
The resulting prediction regions were Γ̃0 = [0, 3], Γ̌1 = [0, 3], Γ̌2 = [1, 4]. The realized Y0 was y0 = 1
associated with w0 = 5.0622.

thus leading to very wide prediction regions for Γ̌1 and Γ̌2 . Since Γ̃0 simply utilized the estimate
of λ̂n+1 , but was totally oblivious to its variability, it was not much affected in such a situation.
However, because of its rigidness with respect to this added variability, it could dramatically suffer.
We demonstrate this situation by plotting an extreme realization in Figure 8 from the third model
with n = 30 and with the w31 outside and far to the left of the values of w1 , . . . , w30 . Observe here
that the three prediction regions Γ̃0 = [257, 323], Γ̌1 = [0, 1100], and Γ̌2 = [0, 1665] are very different
in terms of their lengths (66, 1100, and 1665, respectively). But in this case Γ̃0 did not cover, by
a wide margin, the realized value of Y31 , which was y31 = 49 associated with w31 = −4.0493.
This particular demonstration warns us of the danger and pitfalls of making a prediction for a
response variable that is associated with a covariate vector outside the convex hull of the covariate
vectors used in the construction of the prediction regions and when the Poisson rate hyper-surface
generated by the map x 7→ ρ(xθ) is complex. As a word of caution, when performing extrapolation
to do predictions, be forewarned of sinkholes littering the forecasting road — and, if it could be
avoided, make no forecasts on long, especially very long, horizons. But, alas, this is the type of
forecasting problem that is actually realistic and of most interest, such as that of predicting the
number of cases or deaths due to COVID-19 in a future date, given the observed data up to a

Based on the results of these simulation studies, the prediction region Γ̌1 appears to be the
most preferable among the three prediction regions. In our illustration using the COVID-19 data
set in Section 4, we will therefore just present the prediction region provided by Γ̌1 .

Forecasting Application to COVID-19 Pandemic

We now present in this section an illustration of the potential application of the procedures discussed
in the preceding sections. One of the interesting questions during this COVID-19 pandemic is the
forecasting of the number of cumulative deaths in the US at a given date, for example, at the end of
May 31, 2020, given information up to a certain date, say May 15, 2020. Such forecasts are of critical
importance since they could partly be the basis of highly consequential and possibly controversial
decisions by federal, state, and local governments officials, school administrators, executives of
big corporations and small businesses, religious leaders, and many others. Such decisions could
pertain to when to institute stay-in-place directives, when to issue social distancing or social easing
guidelines, when to open business establishments, when to open public places such as shopping malls
and ocean beaches, when to allow religious gatherings, etc. Data for daily deaths and cumulative

deaths, as well as cases, for different countries and states due to the COVID-19 are available
from either the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/
2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html, Johns Hopkins University https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/
data, or the European CDC https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/ [11].
Clearly, the sequence of cumulative deaths does not satisfy the independence assumption, so
a non-homogeneous Poisson process model [23] is not an appropriate model for cumulative deaths
when viewed as a continuous-time stochastic process. However, a non-homogeneous Poisson process
could plausibly model the occurrences of deaths in continuous-time, from which it follows that the
sequence of daily deaths will be independently Poisson distributed with possibly different rates
depending on the number of days from the time origin and the specific day of the week, as well as
other features such as, for example, the quality of the health care facilities, which is hard to quantify
and not available in the European CDC data set. Our novel idea therefore is to utilize Poisson
regression to predict the number of daily deaths according to the methods developed earlier, and
then to aggregate these daily forecasts to obtain forecasts of the cumulative deaths.
We will use the data set for the US provided by the European CDC ([11]) plotted in Figure
1 which are the observed numbers of daily deaths attributed to COVID-19 starting on March
1, 2020, the day after the first reported death due to COVID-19, until May 15, 2020. Note
that, technically, this will be the deaths data at the end of May 14, 2020. Using this data set

on May 15th, and given the cumulative number of deaths until then, the goal is to forecast the
cumulative number of deaths in the US due to COVID-19 by the end of May 31, 2020, that
is, June 1, 2020. We limit our illustration to simply utilizing the variable DayNum, which is the
number of days starting from December 31, 2019, Day which the day of the week, and Deaths,
the variable representing the daily number of deaths. We surmise that the deaths data set is
the most reliable among the data sets that were compiled, compared, for instance, to the data
set pertaining to the number of cases or infected people. However, the deaths data set need
not also be totally reliable and could be subject to misclassification error and competing causes of
deaths., For example, a patient who contracted COVID-19 who dies primarily because of pneumonia
may be classified as having died of COVID-19, but could also be classified as having died, not of
COVID-19, but of pneumonia. See also, for instance, the WSJ article [14], [2], and the BBC
news article https://www.bbc.com/news/world-53073046 [10], the last two discussing the notion
of “excess deaths,” which are deaths that may have been due to the pandemic, but which are
not included in the reported COVID-19 deaths data set. Certainly, we could have used other
information such as the number of reported cases; by performing separate forecasts in each of
the 50 states and the District of Columbia, then aggregating; or even by utilizing counties or
metropolitan cities as strata, and then combining forecasts from these strata to obtain an overall
forecast for the whole US. However, for illustrative purposes, we decided to keep things simple.

From March 1 (DayNum = 62) to May 15 (DayNum = 137), consisting of 76 days, we have the
daily number of deaths, hence also the cumulative number of deaths. The other variable used in
the modeling is Day (e.g., Sunday, Monday, etc.) associated with each value of DayNum, which is a
categorical or factor variable. We fitted a Poisson regression model using the glm function in R with
a log-link, with response being Y = Deaths and covariate vector X = (1, W, W 2 , W 3 , W 4 , W 5 , Day),
where W = DayNum, and Day is considered as a factor variable hence is converted into six, instead
of seven since we already have an intercept term, dummy variables in the design matrix. We
chose this 5th-order model with respect to DayNum since the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
values, computed under the Poisson regression model, appear to stabilize starting at this model
and adhering to the Law of Parsimony (Occam’s Razor). The AIC values associated with the 8thand 9th-order models were actually smaller than for the 5th-order model; however, these models
possess highly unstable predicted values. Table 1 summarizes the AIC values for the different
models, both without and with Day in the model. It also contains the estimates of ξ, the overdispersion parameter in a model that will be introduced shortly, and as we will then see, larger
values of ξ are indicative of the Poisson regression model becoming a more adequate model.
The histogram and time plot of the residuals with respect to DayNum are provided in Figure 9.
Recall that the ith residual in Poisson regression is defined as
Yi − λ̂i
Ri = p
, i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
λ̂i
where λ̂i is the fitted value associated with xi . As such, if the Poisson regression model is adequate,
one should see a histogram similar to that associated with a centered (at zero) Poisson distribution
with unit rate, but this will just be an approximation since the rates are estimated, hence that
affects the distribution of the residual. Similarly, the time plot of the residuals should be randomly
distributed on the zero horizontal line. The histogram and time plot in Figure 9, with the time
21

plot also showing a lowess fit, do not appear to contradict expected behaviors under the Poisson
regression model assumptions of Poissonness, independence, and an adequate rate function. In the
time plot, observe the outliers at DayNum values of 64 and 81, with mild outliers at DayNum of 70, 71,
82, 84, and 108. The outlying values at DayNum 64 and 81 could be a consequence of the uncertainty
on who to count as COVID-19 deaths since they occurred in the early days of recording COVID-19
deaths, while on Daynum 81, which was March 20th, there were zero reported COVID-19 deaths,
highly suspect since two days before and two days after this day there were 23, 42, 110, and 80
COVID-19 reported deaths. The outlier on DayNum 108, corresponding to April 16th, was due to a
one-time adjustment of 3778 that was made because of a change in criteria on what are considered
as COVID-19 deaths [1, 14]. The two days prior to April 16th, there were 1541 and 2408 deaths
reported, while the three days after April 16th, there were 2299, 3770, and 1856 deaths reported.
Thus, the reported number on April 16th of 4928, the highest number of daily deaths reported, is
an outlier explained by the adjustment made. However, we still included these perceived outliers
in the fitting of the fifth-order, with respect to DayNum, Poisson regression model. Later, when we
consider forecasting for July 15th and August 1st, and since another significant adjustment was
made on June 26th, we will re-allocate each of the adjustments proportionately to the observed
deaths on the days on or before the adjustment day.

DayNum

Based on the fitted model’s residuals, we further assessed the independence assumption of the
daily deaths. We do this by creating a contingency table for DayNum with six intervals and with
Residuals being either negative or positive and then performing a test for independence. The
observed contingency table is presented in Table 2. A chi-square test for independence based on
this table yielded χ2c = 4.4685 on 5 degrees-of-freedom, with associated p-value of 0.4841, hence the
null hypothesis of independence cannot be rejected. Observe, however, that the fit of the model
in the early days is not satisfactory, and between DayNum 99 to 112, there was a preponderance of
negative residuals, possibly owing to the influence of the adjusted reported daily deaths on DayNum
108.
It may appear surprising and counter intuitive to include a Day effect in the model, since one

could argue that when a patient is dying, he/she does not really have any control or choice of which
day he/she should die, so that deaths due to COVID-19 should be uniformly distributed over the
days of a week. However, the data pertains to reported daily deaths, and so the number of daily
deaths could be affected by reporting delays due possibly to limited health or hospital personnel
during certain days of the week. The fitted model based on data up to May 15th did demonstrate
that there is a Day effect. Based on the estimates of the regression coefficients, Sunday has the
lowest Day effect, followed by Monday, then Saturday, then Friday, then almost equally by Tuesday
and Thursday, and finally Wednesday, which has the largest effect.
Recall that our main objective is to obtain a prediction region for the cumulative number of
deaths at a specified date, in our case June 1, 2020 (DayNum = 154). This means we were predicting
the cumulative deaths at the end of May 31, 2020. From DayNum = 138 to DayNum = 154, there
were a total of 17 days. If we denote by Yj , j = 62, 63, . . . , 154, the random variable denoting the
daily number of deaths for DayNum
Pk = j, the random variable denoting the cumulative number of
deaths until DayNum = k is Sk = j=62 Yk . Thus, we are seeking a prediction region for S154 , given
that S137 = 85906. Under the fitted Poisson regression model, Yj , given

xj = 1, wj , wj2 , wj3 , wj4 , wj5 , d1j , d2j , d3j , d4j , d5j , d6j
with wj = DayNumj and dkj , k = 1, 2, . . . , 6, the dummy variables representing whether Day is a
Tuesday, a Wednesday, a Thursday, a Friday, a Saturday, or a Sunday, respectively, has Poisson
distribution with rate λ(xj ; θ) = exp {xj θ} . We mention that in our R code for fitting this model,
for computational stability, we first centered and standardized the non-constant columns of the
xj ’s. Let α∗ ∈ (0, 1), and the Yj s being independent. From the preceding section we know how
to construct a 100(1 − α∗ )% prediction interval [aj , bj ] for Yj , where, as mentioned earlier, we will
simply utilize the prediction region Γ̌1 . By the independence, we will have

Thus, if we wanted S137 +[a• , b• ] to be a 100(1−α)% prediction interval for S154 , given S137 , we could
choose α∗ = 1 − (1 − α)1/17 . This procedure will guarantee a conservative 100(1 − α)% prediction
interval for S154 , given S137 . This is the approach we followed in constructing a (conservative) 95%
prediction interval for S154 , the cumulative number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the US by the
end of May 31, 2020.

observed DayNum which are depicted in Figure 10. Examining this figure note that there are more

observed Deaths outside the prediction curves than what is expected nominally. This indicates
that either there is more variability inherent in the stochastic mechanism generating the observed
number of daily deaths relative to a purely Poisson regression model, or the fifth-order Poisson rate
model is still inadequate, or both. We propose an approach that introduces over-dispersion with
the Poisson regression model serving as a hidden model. We mention that our Occam’s Razor-type
solution is motivated by frailty modeling in Survival Analysis (see, for instance, [5]). Our model
assumes the existence of an unobserved positive latent variable Zj of mean 1 at wj = DayNumj , and
the reported number of deaths Yj is the integer part of Zj Yj∗ , with {Yj∗ } arising from a Poisson
regression model and with Zj and Yj∗ independent. Recall that frailty models in Survival Analysis
24

are used specifically to model correlations among observations; whereas, in our model it serves as
an unobserved random contamination component in the observed number of daily deaths. In our
implementation, we shall take Zj to have a gamma distribution with mean one and variance 1/ξ
(see [8]). This ξ is then an additional parameter in the regression model aside from the parameter
vector θ. Such a model leads to an over-dispersed Poisson regression model, with the purely Poisson
regression model embedded in this model and obtainable as a limiting case when ξ → ∞. Inference
for such a model requires further study, with possible use of an EM-type algorithm, though this
could be difficult to implement since the distributions of the Yi s are not in closed forms. However,
we may implement a Z-estimation approach (see, for instance, [29]). We first note that
E(Yi ) ≈ E[E(Yi |Zi )] = E[Zi λi ] = λi
V ar(Yi ) ≈ E[V ar(Yi |Zi )] + V ar[E(Yi |Zi )]

The approximate higher-order moments of the Yi s are also obtainable. Based on these moments,
we could form the set of estimating equations, where we recall that ρ(w) = exp(w):

It turns out that a simpler way to obtain the estimates of θ and ξ is to first obtain the estimate
θ̃ of θ from the first estimating equation. This could be done by using the glm object function
in R [20] with the Poisson family and logarithm link. The estimate ξ˜ of ξ is then obtained from
the second estimating equation using a one-variable NR iteration with θ replaced by θ̃. Define the
(p + 1) × (p + 1) matrices Σ and Ω according to

Σ = plim n1 ni=1 U((Yi , xi ); θ, ξ)⊗2 and Ω = plim n1 ni=1 H((Yi , xi ); θ, ξ),

Implementing this procedure based on this over-dispersed Poisson regression model, we first
examine the prediction intervals at each of the observed DayNum values, which are shown in Figure
11. We now see that these approximate 95% prediction intervals cover most of the observed daily
deaths. This indicates that the over-dispersed Poisson regression model provides a better fit to
the observed daily deaths data than the purely Poisson regression model whose approximate 95%
prediction intervals are shown in Figure 10. The estimate of ξ turned out to be ξˆ = 16.89016. The

left-panel of Figure 12 is the scatterplot of daily deaths, but now including the actual observed
values after DayNum 137 and until 154 (these are the red dots) and the prediction intervals for
the daily deaths past 137. Observe that the prediction intervals for DayNum between 62 and 137
are wider than those in Figure 11 and the reason for this is the prediction coefficient used is now
adjusted for the goal of constructing a prediction interval for S154 . In this case, α∗ = 0.003012.
The right-panel of Figure 12 displays the prediction interval for S154 , given S137 ; in fact, this
also displays the prediction intervals for Sk , k = 138, 139, . . . , 153, given S137 . The red dots are the
actual observed values past DayNum equal to 137. The predicted cumulative deaths on DayNum = 154
was Ŝ154 = 96876 and the conservative prediction interval for S154 was [86157, 118323]. In both of
these plots, notice that the 5th-order prediction model did not perform well past DayNum = 150,
though the prediction interval for S154 did cover what was actually observed, which was 104383.
From Figure 12, an elevated number of daily deaths occurred starting at DayNum = 150 (May 28).

Sensitivity Analysis

To partly assess the sensitivity of the procedure, if we had used the data until DayNum = 145
(May 23rd), the predicted value for S154 is Ŝ154 = 101010 and the conservative 95% prediction
interval, given S145 , is [96567, 106057]. The associated plots in this case are provided in Figure
13. On the other hand, if we had used the data until June 1, 2020 (DayNum = 154), the fitted
value is 104383, which coincided with the observed cumulative number of deaths. That the fitted
cumulative number of deaths and the observed cumulative number of deaths on the last day were
equal is actually a consequence of the estimating equation, hence in hindsight is not a surprising
result. The associated plots in this case are provided in Figure 14. Observe in the right-panel
of Figure 14 that the model for the cumulative deaths based on this 5th-order model is quite
excellent, lending support to our novel approach of modeling the daily deaths data, instead of
the cumulative deaths data, for the purpose of making predictions for the cumulative deaths. We
summarize the results of this sensitivity analysis in Table 3 and Figure 15, where we report the
predicted values and the prediction intervals for S154 under scenarios where data used in the model
fitting is up to the different days from DayNum equal to 137 up to 153. Based on this analysis,
the fifth-order model appears to possess stability since the predictions and the prediction intervals
for S154 remain somewhat consistent as the amount of data being used in the model fitting varies.
As to be expected, note that as the forecasting horizon shortens, then the prediction interval also
narrows. This is the case, even though we still considered the outlier on April 16th, which was the
adjusted Deaths data point, as a legitimate observation.
However, any model, especially higher-order models, will have a breakdown point in the sense of
yielding seemingly unreasonable predictions, perhaps due to a long forecasting horizon, insufficient
amount of data, or wildly changing data points drastically altering estimates which highly impact
forecasts. For this 5th-order model, it appears to break down when the data used is on or before
28

DayNum 132. One possible cause appears to be sharp increases and decreases in the observed daily
deaths. For instance, on DayNum = 120 the reported daily deaths was 1369, but on the next two
days they were 2110 and 2611, and these led to a huge jump in the predicted value for S154 . Also,
from DayNum ranging from 125 to 133, the reported daily deaths were 1317, 1297, 1252, 2144,
2353, 2239, 1510, 1624, and 734, and the predictions were highly unstable and only started to
stabilize after DayNum = 132. This is a clear warning on the danger of fitting higher-order models
or extrapolating with a long forecasting horizon. As the adage goes, attributed to Niels Bohr [28],
with similar versions attributed to Mark Twain, Yogi Berra, and others: It is difficult to make
predictions, especially about the future.

Forecasting Fifteen Days Forward

With dire thoughts of the inherent dangers of forecasting over a long horizon, and fully cognizant
of the many eventualities (e.g., re-opening of economy; nationwide protests and riots due to police
brutality; changing hotspots; adjustments on counts; etc.), which we are not taking into account in
order to be purely data-driven, but which could drastically alter trajectories of daily and cumulative
deaths, on the basis of the observed data up to July 2, 2020, in which the cumulative deaths 128062,
we seek to forecast the cumulative deaths fifteen days forward, which will be July 16, 2020. We
should mention that on June 26th, there was an adjustment of 1854 which occurred “following a
state review of death certificates and prior outbreaks” in the State of New Jersey [6]. Together with
the 3778 adjustment made by the State of New York on April 16th [1], this is the second documented
non-trivial adjustment made on the daily deaths counts. We provide two point predictions and
prediction regions for the target date: – the first one based on considering the observed Deaths
values on April 16th and June 26th as legitimate values, and the second one based on re-allocating
the adjustment values on those days proportional to the observed Deaths on the days on or before
the day of adjustment. Without additional information, such a proportional re-allocation of the
adjustment values appears to be most sensible, though this approach is not immune to criticism.
Figure 16 presents the point prediction and the prediction interval for July 16, 2020 based on
these two analyses on with a 5th-order model. When the adjustment values are not re-allocated,

June 1, 2020, which was 104383.

the predictions and prediction intervals are depicted in the two top plots, whereas when they
are re-allocated, they are in the two bottom plots. With no re-allocation, the point prediction
is 143272 together with an associated prediction interval of [128062, 176957] for the cumulative
deaths. With re-allocation, the point prediction is 146055 with an associated prediction interval of
[128121, 185369]. Observe that without re-allocation, the observed Deaths of 2437 on June 26th
fell outside of the prediction interval on that date, while the observed Deaths of 4928 on April
16th barely fell inside the prediction interval on that date. Notice the wider prediction intervals
for Deaths when no re-allocations were performed compared to those with re-allocations for the
observed DayNum values. Observe also the widening prediction intervals as we go farther away
from July 2nd, indicating high uncertainty on what may happen moving forward. Interestingly,
the prediction interval for the cumulative deaths on July16th when re-allocations were performed
is wider than that without re-allocations, and the point prediction is also tad higher. Ominously,
notice that the prediction curve for Deaths appears to be acquiring an increasing trend past July
2nd, in contrast to the decreasing trend from DayNum 120 (April 28th) to 183 (June 30th). It
remains to be seen if this is the effect of the lessening of social distancing guidelines, re-opening
of business establishments and beaches, people gathering because of the current social unrest, or
changing hotspots in the country. Of course, in forecasting settings with new data points accruing
frequently – daily in this COVID-19 pandemic – forecasts should be updated as each new data
point accrues. We intend to provide a publicly-accessible software applet to enable interested users
to update forecasts with the latest updated data.

Concluding Remarks

Motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we examined the problem of constructing prediction regions
for a Poisson distributed random variable, both under the no-covariate (that is, intercept only)

and with-covariate settings. We compared the performances of the different prediction regions
through simulation studies. In the regression setting, we also introduced an over-dispersed Poisson
regression model upon observing over-dispersion in the COVID-19 reported Deaths data relative
to a purely Poisson regression model. With the ultimate goal of predicting cumulative deaths
due to COVID-19 at a future date, we first studied how to construct prediction intervals for the
daily deaths data, and then utilized these prediction intervals to construct the prediction interval
for the cumulative deaths. The final fitted models involved a 5th-order model in the variable
DayNum, and also included the factor variable Day. Based on data until July 2, 2020, prediction
and prediction interval for the July 16, 2020 cumulative deaths were obtained. The methodologies
developed have the potential to be used in the monitoring of daily and cumulative deaths during
epidemics or pandemics through the construction of prediction regions, which could then be used
by decision-makers regarding implementation of social distancing/easing guidelines and deciding
on the closure/opening of business, educational, government, and other establishments. However,
further studies are needed to compare our methodologies to other methods that have been proposed
during this pandemic.
The prediction and prediction region procedures we developed also possess limitations. First, in
contrast to the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartment model cf., [4], based
on a continuous-time Markov Chain, our model does not posit an upper bound to the number of
people that could die, which clearly is not the case. Second, especially since it involves higherorder terms in DayNum, they are highly sensitive to outliers, such as when huge adjustments are
made as in the cases for the States of New York and New Jersey [14, 6]. It would be desirable to
develop procedures that are robust to such non-trivial adjustments, or to procedures that impose
constraints on the rate of increase or decrease of the prediction curve via regularization to curb
the influential impact of such adjustments, though this will entail developing new theory for the
construction of prediction regions. Due to these first two limitations, the proposed methods are not
suitable for use in long-horizon forecasting, hence our decision to simply forecast 15 days forward.
Third, the procedures are not adaptive in its choice of the prediction model. Possible improvements
may occur by choosing the prediction model in a data-dependent manner, but then model choice
uncertainty needs to be accounted for in constructing prediction regions. Fourth, there could be
an advantage in utilizing other bases functions to transform the variable DayNum, such as by using
Laguerre polynomials, Legendre polynomials, trigonometric functions, or even splines or wavelets.
These limitations of the proposed methods generate several potential research avenues for further
studies.
