Abstract
In this study, we present a new epidemiological model, with contamination from confirmed and
unreported. We also compute equilibria and study their stability without intervention strategies.
Optimal control theory has proven to be a successful tool in understanding ways to curtail the spread
of infectious diseases by devising the optimal disease intervention strategies. We investigate the impact
of distancing, case finding, and case holding controls while at the same time, we minimize the number
of infected and dead individuals. The method consists of minimizing the cost functional related to
infectious, death, and controls through some strategies to reduce the spread of the COVID19 epidemic.

I NTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve for more than six months around the world.
Many countries have applied containment measures, then deconfinement. Currently, because of
the resurgence of cases, some of these countries are proceeding with re-containment measures.
The health and social distancing measures are not always respected by the populations. Among
the confirmed cases, there are caregivers. That shows a security flaw in the quarantine procedures.
There are many undetected cases in the people who favor the evolution of the pandemic.
Hopes are on the discovery of a vaccine. But in the meantime, it is useful to come up with strategies
that allow us to manage the pandemic better.
Several recent works have used SIR / SEIR models and other types of nonlinear differential equations([1],
[2], [15]) to understand the evolution of the pandemic but also to predict its subsequent evolution.
Other techniques are also used such as machine learning, stochastic ([1], [2], [16], [17]), etc.

MODEL FORMULATION

There is some work dedicated to the application of optimal control to the pandemic. Many authors
has used optimal control to study some diseases like HIV [8], [20].
We analyze an epidemiological differential equation model with the identification of its parameters
and initial values, based upon reported case data from public health sources. The objective of this
work is to develop control strategies to stem the evolution of the pandemic.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present the model. In section 3, a mathematical
analysis of the model is performed. Then, in section 4, we introduce an optimal control problem
to study. Thus in section 5, we show numerical results of the optimal control problem. We discuss
the results in section 6. We explain the methods we use in this work in section 7. Finally, we give
conclusions and perspectives in section 8.

with t0 the starting time of the epidemic. Figure 1 depicts a flow diagram of the model.
In this model, the confirmed are automatically quarantined. Even in general, there may have
some stages before confirmed individuals become quarantined. In this work, we consider these
two compartments as one. Security failing during the quarantine or the process of quarantine can
expose susceptible people to contamination. That is modeled by the term βSI1 . Then a proportion
 of confirmed I1 can interact with susceptible.

M ATHEMATICAL

ANALYSIS

One of the most critical concerns about any infectious disease is its ability to invade a population.
The basic reproduction number, R0 is a measure of the potential for disease spread in a population.
It represents the average number of secondary cases generated by an infected individual introduced
into a susceptible population with no immunity to the disease in the absence of interventions to
control the infection. If R0 < 1, then on average, an infected individual produces less than one
newly infected individual throughout his infection period. In this case, the infection may die out in
the long run. Reversely, if R0 > 1, each infected individual produces, on average more than one new
infection. Hence the disease will be able to spread in a population. A significant value of R0 may

indicate the possibility of a major epidemic. Using the next-generation operator technique described
by ([5]) and subsequently analyzed by ([21]), we obtained the basic reproduction number.

3.1.

Well–posedness of the model

In this section, we prove that the system (1) is epidemiologically meaningful. In other words,
solutions of system (1) with positive initial data remain positive for all time t > 0. Now, adding all
equations in the differential system (1) gives
Ṅ = Λ − µN − d1 I1 − d2 I2 ≤ Λ − µN.

which implies that the trajectories of system (1) are bounded.

On the other hand, solving the differential inequality
It then follows that, limt7→∞ N (t) =

(4)

which is a positively invariant set of system (1) . Furthermore, the model (1) is well-posed epidemiologically and we will consider dynamic behavior of model (1) on D.

3.2.

Equilibrium point

To obtain the disease-free equilibrium, I(t), I1 (t), I2 (t) and the right-hand-side of system (1) are set
to zero. Then, the disease-free equilibrium will be given by
Λ

Rate reproduction number

By using the next-generation operator method on the system (1), we establish the linear stability of
E0 . Using the notation in [21], the matrices F and V, for the new infection terms and the remaining

Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS

Lemme 3.1. The DFE of the Covid 19-only model (1), is locally asymptotically stable (LAS) if R0 < 1,
and unstable if R0 > 1.
The threshold quantity of R0 is the reproduction number for COVID-19. It measures the average number of new Covid-19 infections generated by a single COVID-19 infected individual in a
population where a certain fraction of infected individuals is treated.

3.4.

Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium

We now turn to the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium E0 . We prove that the diseasefree equilibrium E0 is globally asymptotically stable under a certain threshold condition. To this
aim, we use a result obtained by Kamgang and Sallet [11].
Let x1 = (S, R) and x2 = (I2 , I1 , I). We express the sub-system
ẋ1 = A1 (x1 , 0).(x − x∗1 ),


Ṡ
Ṙ

as

(7)

= Λ − µ S,
= −µ R.

It is a linear system which is globally asymptotically stable at the equilibrium E0 , corresponding to
the DFE where the hypotheses H1 and H2 in [11] are satisfied.
The matrix A2 (x) is given by



A2 (x) = 

The eigenvalues of the sub-matrix:


−(µ + d1 + θ1 )

.
J0 = 
0
βS0 − (µ + α1 + α2 )
Since J0 is a matrix of dimension 2, necessaries conditions for J0 to be stable is tr(J0 ) < 1 and
det(J0 ) > 0. Note that tr(J0 ) < 0 gives βS0 < µ + α1 + α2 . Also, the condition det(J0 ) > 0 gives
βS0 ≤ µ + α1 + α2 .

(8)

Note that the inequality (8) corresponds to R0 ≤ 1. This achieves the proof.
We have the following result about the stability of the disease-free equilibrium.
Théorème 3.1. The disease-free equilibrium of system (1) is globally asymptotically stable in D whenever R0 ≤ 1. This implies the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium on the nonnegative orthant R5 , i.e., the disease naturally dies out.
Proof. We consider the Lyapunov function defined by V (S, I, I1 , I2 ) = I . So, we have

Moreover V̇ = 0 if I = 0 or S = S0 and R0 = 1. Since we are in a positively invariant compact, by
LaSalle’s invariance principle [12], the DFE is globally asymtotically stable in D.

O PTIMAL

CONTROL IN THE EPIDEMIC MODEL

Optimal control problems have generated a lot of interest from researchers all over the world. For
instance (Imanov, 2011, see [9]) examined the application of the method of similar solutions in
solving time optimal control problems with state constraints. Similarly, various techniques have
been applied to study optimal control problems related to dynamical systems. However, we considered the aspect of optimal control to reduce the spread of COVID-19 disease through the combination of the aspects of the education campaign, quarantine, and treatment of infected individuals.
This study intends to apply optimal control theory to minimize the spread disease by some control
strategies and minimize the cost of applying controls in order to best combat the spread of COVID19 disease.
Consider these two epidemic models with controls u1 (t), u2 (t), u3 (t), death D(t), recovered R1 (t)
from infected reported and recovered R2 (t) from infected unreported, given by the following two

We consider, in this work, three controls: distancing control u1 (t) , case finding control u2 (t)
, and case holding control u3 (t) and 0 ≤ u1 (t), u2 (t), u3 (t) ≤ 1.
– The distancing control, u1 (t): implies the effort of preventing susceptible individuals
from becoming infectious individuals. The strategies, such as early detection of infectious individuals, isolation of infectious people, and health campaign and education,
are related to u1 (t). It reduces the risk of contamination of susceptible by the reported
individuals during quarantine and treatment. It also reduces the contamination from
unreported, since due to health campaigns and education, individuals who suspect they
are infected may apply social distancing and self-quarantine.
– The case-finding control, u2 (t): represents the screening of high-risk exposed individuals
in the first model and, additionally, the treatment of infected individuals in the second
model. It increases the detection of infected individuals and also increases the recovered
cases in the second model.
– The case holding control, u3 (t): refers to the effort required to complete the treatment
of infected individuals, such as activities used to ensure the regularity of drug intake
until a lasting cure is attained and financial support by the government. It increases
the detection of cases in the second model, reduces unreported cases, increases the
recovered cases, and reduces death cases in the two models.

4.1.

Modeling the optimal control problem

In this subsection, we present the optimal control problem we intend to solve. Two strategies are
proposed to analyze the spread of the viruses when some controls are applied.
Let’s set u(t) = (u1 (t), u2 (t), u3 (t)) ∈ [0, 1]3 , x(t) = (S(t), I(t), I1 (t), I2 (t), R1 (t), R2 (t), D(t)) and
x0 = (S0 , I0 , I10 , I20 , R10 , R20 , D0 ).
Our objective functional to be minimized is as follows:

J(x, u) =

(11)

We assume that the relative intervention costs are nonlinear and take a quadratic form in the controls. The coefficients, ai i = 1 · · · 7, are balancing factors according to the size and the importance

of the objective functional. Thus, we seek optimal controls variables u∗ and states variables x∗ such
that

J(x, u)

(12)

x(0) = x0
By minimizing the functional, we want to reduce, at the same time, the infectious asymptomatic,
the reported and unreported symptomatic, the death, and the controls.
Further, we will propose a constructed functional J(x, u). For the construction of that functional,
refer to section 7.

4.2.

Existence of an optimal control solution

We analyze sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution to the optimal control problem
((13)). Using a result in Fleming and Rishel ([6] ) and Hattaf and Yousfi ([7]), the existence of the
optimal control can be obtained.
Théorème 4.1. There exists an optimal control u∗ and corresponding state x∗ to the problem (13).
Proof. The existence of an optimal control is guaranteed by Corollary 4.1 of Fleming ([6] ) due the
following
1. the convexity of the integrand of J with respect to u;
2. a priori boundedness of the state solutions;
3. Lipschitz property of the state system with respect to the state variables.
Since the functional is continuously differentiable in t, x, u, and with the bounded domains of the
state x and the control u, there exist an optimal control and state (x∗ , u∗ ) that minimize the functional (11).
The following theorem is a consequence of the maximum principle.
Théorème 4.2. Given an optimal control u∗ and corresponding state x∗ solutions to the problem (13),
then there exist adjoint variable p such that u∗, x∗ satisfy the Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle.
Proof. Since the problem (13) with the model (10) generalize the problem with the model (10),
we only perform a proof for the problem (13) with the model (10).
The theorem is a direct application of Pontryagin’s maximum principle ([18]). Then the Hamiltonian of the problem (13) is given as follows:
H = a1 I(t) + a2 I1 (t) + a3 I2 (t) + a4 D(t) +

where gi , i = 1 · · · 7 denotes the right side of the differential equation of the i the state variables,
and p = (p1 (t), p2 (t), p3 (t), p4 (t), p5 (t), p6 (t), p7 (t)) the associated adjoints for the states x. Then,
we obtain

states, which results in adjoint system of theorem (4.2). The Hamiltonian H is minimized with
respect to the controls at the optimal controls; therefore, we differentiate H with respect to u1 , u2 ,

The functional we minimize has two parts. The first part is composed of infected and death terms,
while the second part is composed of the control terms. The size scale of these two parts is very
different. Hence the choice of the coefficients a1 , · · · , a7 , as balance, has a great influence on the
result.
We construct a function with an economic sens by using some data. More details on the construction of that function can be found in the appendix.
We see in the figures 2, 4 and 6, that for all the two strategies the infected asymptomatic individuals
I, the infected reported individuals I1 and the infected unreported individuals I2 are reduced compared to the case without controls. Also, the death cases are reduced with controls in comparison
to the situation without controls.
The second strategy is better than the first one. Indeed, in the second strategy, there is no epidemic.
The results in the figures 7 and 8 show a difference in the number of infected (Reported/ Unreported) individuals without controls compared to the number with optimal strategies. Due to the
control strategies 1 and/or 2, the number of infected individuals (Reported/ Unreported) decreases
and reaches the turning point of the asymptomatic infectious cases later than without controls. At
the same time, optimal strategies reduced the maximal number of infected (Reported/ Unreported)
people compared to the case without controls. In other words, the maximal value of the peak
decreases, and the time of the peak is postponed by applying controls.

Estimation of parameters

The estimation of the parameters of the model (1) is done by using techniques in [15], [1] and
[2]. We fit the cumulative data with an exponential function T N I(t) = b exp(ct) − a. In addition,
Z t
we assume that the cumulative function can be given in integral form as T N I(t) = α1
I(s)ds +

T N I0 .
Then T N I(t0 ) = T N I0 = b exp(ct0 ) − a. Thus, we obtain t0 =
Also, we have:

ln(T N I0 + a) − ln(b)
.

I(t) = T N
Then I(t0 ) =

then I(t)
Let’s set δ1 and δ2 such that I1 = δ1 I and I2 = δ2 I. Then replacing in the second an third equation
of the following system:

 I˙ = β S (I + I1 + I2 ) − (µ + α1 + α2 ) I,

Then introducing (19) in the first equation of (17), we obtain:

Hence

Replacing (19) in (20), we obtain:

The pandemic death rate d is estimated by using reported death data. We consider the same value

For the birth rate, we use 32.9% of year 2018, from https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Démographie_
du_Sénégal. Then the recruitment is Λ = 32.9%N/365 by day. The death rate is 7.9% by year at
2018.
We consider that 80% of cases can be detected. Then f = 0.8 and α2 =

Construction of the functional

In order to have a functional with economic sens, we consider what follows:
• We lost money when people are infected or death. Let’s note that cost a by individual and by
day, associated to I, I1 , I2 and , D. Then a = a1 = a2 = a3 = a4 .
• We lost money when we perform test on susceptible individuals. Let’s note that cost a6 by
day, associated to controls u2 .
• We spend money to provide treatment. Let’s note that cost a7 by day, associated to the control
u3 .
• We spend money to carry out health campaigns and education. Let’s note that cost a5 by day,
associated to the control u1 .

To characterize the loss of money due to infected and death individuals, we use the GDP per
capita. The Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is an indicator of the level of economic
activity. It is the value of GDP divided by the number of inhabitants of a country. This indicator
is sometimes used to roughly measure per capita income. See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Produit_intérieur_brut_par_habitant.
Now considering the 2018 GDP per capita and per day of the Senegal country evaluated to 2456.334
F CF A calculated from 1522 $ per capita, per year. The data come from https://www.populationdata.
net/pays/senegal/. We set a = 2456.334.
A COVID-19 test in Senegal country is evaluated to 50000 F CF A by individual. If we fix a number
of test to perform at 1000 by day, then we have a6 = 50000000. We see that a = a6 · 4.91267 · 10−5 .
We set c = 4.91267 · 10−5 . We choose to fix a5 , a7 to the same value of a6 . Then the functional
becomes:

AND PERSPECTIVES

In this work, we solve optimal control problems. A new epidemic model, with confirmed contamination, has been presented. We use distancing, case finding, and case holding controls to reduce
the spread of the epidemic. We mathematically analyze the model and estimates the parameters
used to solve the optimal control problems. In this particular research, the trend of population dynamics is important. It can be easily seen that by increasing educational campaigns, disease tests,
and financial support ensure drug for infected individuals, we can successfully decrease the number
of infected and death.
In further work, we intend to use models with additional compartments as quarantine and treatment.
