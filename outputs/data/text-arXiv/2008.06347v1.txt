Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a new control-theoretic paradigm for mitigating the
spread of a virus. To this end, our discrete-time controller, aims to reduce the number of new daily deaths, and consequently, the cumulative number of deaths. In
contrast to much of the existing literature, we do not rely on a potentially complex
virus transmission model whose equations must be customized to the “particulars”
of the pandemic at hand. For new viruses such as Covid-19, the epidemiology driving the modelling process may not be well known and model estimation with limited
data may be unreliable. With this motivation in mind, the new paradigm described
here is data-driven and, to a large extent, we avoid modelling difficulties by concentrating on just two key quantities which are common to pandemics: the doubling
time, denoted by d(k) and the peak day denoted by θ(k). Our numerical studies to
date suggest that our appealingly simple model can provide a reasonable fit to real
data. Given that time is of the essence during the ongoing global health crisis, the
intent of this paper is to introduce this new paradigm to control practitioners and
describe a number of new research directions suggested by our current results.

Introduction

The main objective in this paper is to introduce a new control-theoretic paradigm for
mitigation of the spread of pandemic disease. In the sequel, the discrete-time control
variable u(k) corresponds to the “degree of mitigation” which could be clinical or nonclinical in nature. The motivation for the paradigm to follow is simple to explain: When
a new pandemic emerges on the world scene, standard virus transmission models are
typically adopted in an effort to predict and control the uncertain future. However, with
limited epidemiological information available for a novel virus, existing models may be
inappropriate; i.e., such a virus may have many features in its transmission and mitigationresponse dynamics which are not well understood and not captured using virus models
from the past. Accordingly, with this motivation in mind, data-driven modelling is the
focal point in this paper.
In the existing literature, the majority of papers on virus transmission are based on the
so-called “SIR” compartmental model[1] which, at a given point in time, places individuals
into one of three disjoint classes: the susceptible S class, the infectious I class, and the
recovered R class. The wide variety of extensions to this model include considerations
such as death due to the disease, the latency time for infected individuals to become
infectious, severity of illness, quarantining individuals, spatial and demographic effects,
and social network structure; e.g., see the detailed accounts in [3, 2, 4]. As stated in [5],
there are “a thousand and one epidemic models,” and, therefore, customizing the model
to the specifics of the situation at hand is non-trivial. This “customization” issue is
epitomized by the variety of models even within the Covid-19 context, for example, in
[6, 7, 8, 9], we see a range of 7-16 possible states emphasizing different epidemiological
considerations. In the early days of a pandemic, with limited data, not only is it difficult
to build the structural model, but also to estimate its parameters. A particularly thorny
modelling issue is that many infected individuals go undetected [10], in large part due
to asymptomatic or mild cases. This runs counter to many SIR modelling efforts which
assume that the detected cases are equivalent to the true cases when, in fact, the former
will underestimate the latter.
Our approach in this paper, largely intended to counter concerns along the lines above,
is motivated by data reliability issues which arise in the literature. To this end, our starting
point is to work with data in the form of death numbers, which are typically higher fidelity
as these are much less likely to be undetected or under-reported; e.g., see [11]. Although
at first sight, the SIR-related models of [12] and [13] also appear only to use death data,
in fact, their models borrow infection and death-rate parameters from other papers in
the literature. In another recent paper [14], this issue is partially remedied by using
both death and case data with some additional parameters to account for the difference
between detected and true cases. In practice, the high variability in the detection process
seems consistent with the wide uncertainty bands produced by [13] for the proportion of
infected individuals in the population.
In summary, while research efforts aimed at understanding virus transmission mechanisms are valuable and important, the challenges in modelling will not be lost on the
2

reader. Therefore, as mentioned above, we focus entirely on the death process data and
propose a parsimonious three-parameter model. We expect that this approach will appeal
to the control community wherein epidemiology is not a core competency. That being
said, although we avoid transmission dynamics, we make use of two quantities which are
common to epidemics over limited time frames: the so-called “doubling time” and “peak
day” for deaths; over longer horizons, we note that periodic peaking may occur [15]. Thus,
our approach can be viewed as lying between the epidemiologically-based SIR models and
empirically-based phenomenological models in [11] and [16].
In addition to the considerations above, in this paper, we also include the dynamics of
a controller reflecting the effect of mitigation measures aimed at reducing new deaths to
zero. To the best of our knowledge, the earliest work bringing control-theoretic methodologies to epidemiological modelling dates back to the 1970s; see [17, 18, 19]. Building
on this, in [20] the theoretical properties of various mitigation techniques are considered,
while others focussed more specifically on vaccination [21], the combination of vaccination
and treatment [22], non-clinical interventions such as social distancing, quarantining, and
education [23], system delay [24, 25] and spatiotemporal effects [26]; more recently, the
Covid-19 outbreak has been emphasized in [27, 28, 29]. Interestingly, all of these control strategies assume underlying SIR-type models which, as previously discussed, present
various challenges in practice. In contrast to these approaches, a key feature of our datadriven approach is the error dynamics involving the comparison of model-predicted deaths
to actual deaths. This enables both the model and the mitigation controller to be adapted
over time.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: In Section 2 we describe the preliminaries involving the use of data and error dynamics at a high level. Subsequently, in
Sections 3 and 4, the details of our new model and its qualitative properties are provided
for the case of constant mitigation. In Section 5, we describe the process of model parameter estimation and illustrate its use via numerical examples involving Covid-19 data
from Brazil and Mexico, two of the countries among those with the highest of death rates
as of mid-2020. Finally, in Section 6, conclusions and directions for future research are
described with emphasis being on issues of a control-theoretic nature.

Preliminaries

In the sequel, we take k to be the index indicating the day number and u(k) to be the
corresponding level of mitigation provided by the controller. In this first paper aimed at
introducing our new paradigm, we do not consider the detailed mechanics of mitigation.
Suffice it to say, large values of u(k) might represent stronger mitigation measures such as
government mandates on social distancing and the use of masks and therapeutics whereas
smaller values might correspond to “relaxation” of the rules.
Starting at k = 0, at a general level, one begins with an equation for new deaths
N(k + 1) = f (D(k), N(k), u(k))
3

where the cumulative total deaths are naturally constrained to be D(k) = D(k−1)+N(k).
We propose an attractive form for f (D, N, u) in Section 3, based on the doubling time
and peak day quantities from epidemiology.

2.1

Data Driven Adaptive Mitigation

Our control-theoretic paradigm begins with the acquisition of daily death data which is
collected to obtain estimates of the parameters describing the function f above. Once the
model is fixed, consistent with the tenets of receding horizon control, one can make predictions to determine if the control sequence u(k) is mitigating in the sense that limk→∞ N(k) =
0. In practice, the speed of convergence is also a concern and strictly reaching the zero
limit may not be required if the number of deaths is an acceptably small fraction of the
population size.
As a pandemic unfolds over time, the model estimation should be updated periodically
as new data is obtained. That is, letting Na (k) denote the “actual” number of new deaths
.
on day k, as depicted in Figure 1, we use the error e(k) = Na (k)−N(k) to drive the update
of the model, the predicted deaths, and the associated adaptation of the controller u(k).
There are many ways one could proceed when using the error; e.g., one can down-weight
the distant past or smooth the noise using cumulative errors. However, such considerations
are beyond the scope of this article.

Model Equation Details

Our analysis begins with the so-called doubling time, a widely reported metric used in
practice to characterise the number of days d taken for the new deaths to double.∗ If, for
∗

Note our use of the doubling time for new deaths whereas some authors and data providers use this
terminology for cumulative total deaths.

4

example, the doubling time is constant, the number of new deaths on day k + 1 is given
by N(k + 1) = 21/d N(k) so that N(k + d) = 2N(k) as expected. In practice, d = d(k)
is time-varying for reasons such as immunity building up in the population, changes to
mitigation strategies, and medical developments. Therefore, with initial values d(0) = d0
and N(0) = N0 , viewed as “baseline” quantities at the point from which we model, we
obtain new deaths as
N(k + 1) = 21/d(k) N(k).
In the equation above d(k) can be quite general in its functional form. We now specialise
along the lines described in Section 1. That is, we structure d(k) so that it is consistent
with many standard epidemic models which exhibit “peaking” behaviour. Thus, with
d0 > 0, the count on new deaths N(k) climbs until some peak day
.
θ(k) = θ(u(k))
which may be time-varying due to changes in the level of mitigation characterized by the
controller u(k). After the peak day, d(k) becomes negative so that we see declining N(k);
in this post-peak regime, |d(k)| may be viewed as the halving time.
We capture the peaking behaviour by specifying the doubling model as
d(k) =

θ(k)
d0 .
θ(k) − k

which increases as k approaches θ(k) > 0 from the left. If, for some k ∗ , we have k < k ∗ <
θ(k) and k > k ∗ > θ(k), then a single peak occurs at k = k ∗ = θ(k ∗ ). More generally
however, θ(k) may be referred to as the “anticipated” peak day since it can move further
or closer in time due to the variations in u(k) which could even yield multiple peaks.

4

Solution for Open Loop Constant Control

An important starting point in this framework is the case when the level of mitigation is
being held fixed over some extended time period. To this end, we consider the controller
u(k) = u0 for all k. In practice, this would correspond to way the model is typically used;
i.e, the mitigation level is held fixed between model updates and associated assessments of
the efficacy of control measures in place. Subsequently, if the updated model parameters
predict a worsening prognosis, decision makers might increase the level of mitigation u(k).
For the “unit step” input control above, the corresponding peak day is denoted
.
θ0 = θ(u0 ).
and we obtain the equation for new deaths
θ0 −k

N(k + 1) = 21/d(k) N(k) = 2 θ0 d0 N(k)

5

which is readily solved for k ≥ 0. Indeed, expressing N(k) as a product followed by
summation of exponents yields
N(k) =

Insights From New Death Solution

The appealingly simple solution for N(k) above lends itself to various insights about the
evolution and qualitative behavior of deaths. First, it is evident by inspection that N(k)
is bell-shaped due to the negative k 2 exponent, and this is clear from Figure 2. It is also
straightforward to study the dependence of N(k) on θ0 and d0 by first noting that
∂ log N(k)
k(k − 1) log(2)
=
,
∂θ0
2θ02 d0
k(k − kN0 ) log(2)
∂ log N(k)
=
∂d0
2θ0 d20
.
where kN0 = 2θ0 + 1. For the most important case where d0 and θ0 are positive, we see
that N(k) increases in θ0 , decreases in d0 for k < kN0 , and increases in d0 for k > kN0 .
It is apparent that kN0 represents the number of days until the pandemic reverts back
to the early stage baseline level; i.e., N(kN0 ) = N0 . However, in contrast to the early
stage, for k > kN0 , new deaths N(k) are now on a downward trajectory which in some
sense can be viewed as signalling the end point of the pandemic. Finally, it is also of
interest to characterize the number of deaths on the peak day,
N(θ0 ) = 2

θ0 +1
2d0

N0

which, clearly, increases in θ0 and decreases in d0 .
The peak N(θ0 ) above is important in that it correlates strongly with “anticipated
pressure” on hospitals; e.g., it is a predictor of stress on resources such as intensive care
units. In particular, given the concern that N(θ0 ) exceeds some critical level Nmax , one
can easily use the equations above to study safety margins such as


θ0 +1
N
0
S(d0 , θ0 ) = 100 1 − 2 2d0
Nmax
which indicates how far from Nmax , as a percentage, peak deaths will be. When S <
0, since this corresponds to N(θ0 ) > Nmax , one might consider increasing the level of
mitigation by updating u(k) to reduce a potential crisis. In Figure 3, we display a realm
of possible outcomes for this safety margin where, for example, with an initial doubling
time of 10 days, an anticipated peak of up to about 14 days, the (d0 , θ0 ) point lies in the
green-colored safety zone.

Total Number of Deaths and Insights

The total number of deaths, given by
k
X

D(k) =

N(i),

i=0

is not summable as a closed form solution. However, many properties of D(k), inherited
from N(k), are nevertheless clear: First, since each N(i) term is a point on a bell-shaped
curve, D(k) must be a nondecreasing sigmoidal function. Moreover, since N(i) is increasing in θ0 for all i, D(k) must also be increasing in θ0 . This makes the importance of
reducing θ0 by mitigation quite clear. That is, a reduced θ0 leads to a smaller peak which
happens earlier, and, in turn, this lowers the total number of deaths. Furthermore, it is
also apparent that D(k) decreases with respect to d0 for k ≤ kN0 .
For k > kN0 , the N(i) terms are increasing in d0 which makes the global behaviour
of D(k) with respect to d0 non-trivial. However, recalling that kN0 can be viewed as
signalling the end of the pandemic, for reasonable d0 , the terms entering D(k) beyond
N(kN0 ) will be quite small; i.e., the portion of D(k) which increases with respect to d0
will be small enough such that D(k) decreases with d0 . That being said, for very large
d0 , it is easy to see that N(i) ≈ N0 for all i meaning that the portion beyond kN0 is
non-negligible, and D(k) ≈ (k + 1)N0 .

4.3

Approximation of D(k) Using a Normal Distributions

It is also possible to enhance our understanding of total deaths via an approximation
involving the classical normal distribution. To this end, we work with the continuoustime counterparts: Nc (t) for N(k) and Dc (t) for D(k). That is, beginning with the
infinitesimals over time interval dt

To provide an indication of the quality of the above approximation, in Figure 4,
we display D(k) along with Dc (k) for six (θ0 , d0) combinations. It is clear that they
are relatively close for the cases considered and we have found this to be true for a
wide range of practical parameter values. Specifically, the maximum relative difference is
approximately 11% for θ0 , d0 > 2 and 5% for θ0 , d0 > 7, but can be large if θ0 and d0 are
both very small, which is not likely in practice.

Asymptotic Behavior of D(k)

We now gain insight into the asymptotic total number of deaths by letting t tend to

Of particular interest is the dependence on d0 which could not be fully characterized for
D(∞) previously. Thus, differentiating, we find that
∂ log Dc (∞)

where z0 = µ0 /σ0 and A(z0 ) = ϕ(−z0 )/(1 − Φ(−z0 )). Clearly, for θ0 , d0 > 0, the above
derivative is negative if z02 + A(z0 )z0 − 1 > 0. A straightforward numerical calculation
shows that this holds true for z0 > 0.84 which is equivalent to d0 < 0.98θ0 . Thus, Dc (∞)
decreases with d0 until it reaches θ0 , and, although this is an approximation to what
happens for D(∞), it is nonetheless a useful insight into its behavior. In practice, we
have found that θ0 is larger than d0 ; see the analysis of the two countries in Section 5
and note that this also true for a variety of other countries not shown. In summary, for
practical purposes, one can view the total deaths as decreasing in d0 .

Model Estimation and Numerical Examples

Given a data set of actual deaths, Na (1), . . . , Na (n), for the purpose of estimating the
parameters N0 , d0 , and θ0 , using the resulting total death values Da (k), we minimize
n
X

(Da (k) − D(k))2 .

k=1

Since this objective function in nonlinear and non-convex in the parameters, we obtain
good initial values by working with log-new-deaths. Then, a straightforward calculation
leads to a classical linear least squares problem; i.e., minimizing
2
n 
X
log Na (k)
2
− β0 − β1 k − β2 k
log
2
k=1
yields β̂0 , β̂1 , and β̂2 from which we obtain estimates
N̂0 = 2β̂0 ; dˆ0 = 1/(β̂1 + β̂2 ); θ̂0 = −(β̂1 + β̂2 )/(2β̂2 ).
In some cases, these initial least squares estimates may be satisfactory solutions to the
underlying problem in Da (k) and D(k). In other cases, further iterations are needed
because they may be sensitive to noisy daily death data.

5.1

Numerical Examples: Brazil and Mexico

We now illustrate the application of our new model using historical data for year 2020
available in https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus. To this end, consider death
data for Brazil and Mexico beginning on March 28, 2020, a day on which Brazil had
ninety-two total deaths and Mexico had only twelve, and ending on June 21, 2020. For
both countries we estimated the parameter triple (N̂0 , dˆ0, θ̂0 ) using the procedure described
above. Then we compared model-based predictions with actual death numbers and made
projections on the asymptotic value D(∞) obtained as k → ∞. The reader is reminded
that an implicit assumption in our calculations is that the degree of mitigation u(k) is
held constant; if a country prematurely relaxes measures such as social distancing, the
model parameters should be recalibrated incorporating new data which comes to light.
10

In the case of Brazil, the estimated parameter values are N̂0 = 28.0, dˆ0 = 6.68, and
θ̂0 = 70.4. The favorable performance of our model is depicted in Figure 5 where new
deaths appear to be peaking around the time the model predicts. By summing up the
daily totals, we readily obtain total deaths which increase sigmoidally to 49, 976 by the end
of the observation period; interestingly, the asymptotic value D∞ ≈ 74, 000 is about 50%
higher than this. In the case of Mexico, the estimated parameter values are N̂0 = 19.9,
dˆ0 = 9.25, and θ̂0 = 86.0. The fit to the data is shown in Figure 6 where, in contrast to
Brazil, daily deaths had not quite peaked by the end of the observation period. Again by
summing up new deaths, we obtain 20, 781 as the number of total deaths and note that
the asymptotic value D(∞) ≈ 44, 000 is over 100% higher.

Conclusion

This paper, part of the voluminous body of literature on epidemic modelling and control,
differs from previous work using SIR-type models; i.e., we do not structure the dynamics
based on many possible epidemiological considerations. Rather, we focus on a death
doubling parameter d(k) and a peak day parameter θ(k), and rely on data to dynamically
update the model as required. This approach to model identification is similar to those
of [11] and [16] and, as previously mentioned, is motivated by the fact that each epidemic
can present a vastly different array of challenges. For a new epidemic such as Covid-19,
our view is that it may be premature to use highly structured model equations which
rely on detailed epidemiological factors. As evidenced by our numerical experiments, our
data-driven approach, with very few parameters to be estimated, appears to fit the data
quite well; this is also true for simulations we conducted for many other countries not
shown.
Based on our work to date, two important directions immediately present themselves
for future work: First, for the case when the mitigation level u(k) is no longer constant, it
would be interest to study the evolution of deaths in an adaptive control context; i.e., as
system parameters due to the arrival of new data, the controller u(k) is correspondingly
adjusted. The control-theoretic setup in Figure 1 should rightfully be viewed in this more
general context.
The second area for future research involves the formulation of an appropriate performance index. To provide some flavor as to the type of performance quantification issues
which arise, for the current Covid-19 crisis, it is noted that societies around the world
have been grappling with the following questions: How does the degree of mitigation
get reflected in N(k) and D(k)? What tradeoffs is a society willing to accept between
“lifestyle restrictions” and the level of deaths? Although existing literature includes “optimal control” formulations for epidemics, it is silent as to the detailed construction of the
performance index. To illustrate what is meant by this, for the classical quadratic case
J(u) = Q

N

to say the least, it may be highly challenging to choose weights Q and R reflecting the
tradeoffs which a society is willing to accept. In fact, it may prove to be the case that
there are other cost functionals which are better suited for the study of pandemics.
