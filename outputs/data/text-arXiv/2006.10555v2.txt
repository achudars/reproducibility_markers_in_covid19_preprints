Abstract
In this paper, we estimate the time-varying COVID-19 contact rate of a Susceptible-InfectedRecovered (SIR) model. Our measurement of the contact rate is constructed using data
on actively infected, recovered and deceased cases. We propose a new trend filtering
method that is a variant of the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, constrained by the number
of possible kinks. We term it the sparse HP filter and apply it to daily data from five countries: Canada, China, South Korea, the UK and the US. Our new method yields the kinks
that are well aligned with actual events in each country. We find that the sparse HP filter
provides a fewer kinks than the `1 trend filter, while both methods fitting data equally
well. Theoretically, we establish risk consistency of both the sparse HP and `1 trend filters. Ultimately, we propose to use time-varying contact growth rates to document and
monitor outbreaks of COVID-19.

Introduction

Since March 2020, there has been a meteoric rise in economic research on COVID-19. New
research outputs have been appearing on the daily and weekly basis at an unprecedented
level.1 To sample a few, Ludvigson et al. (2020) quantified the macroeconomic impact of
COVID-19 by using data on costly and deadly disasters in recent US history; Manski and
Molinari (2020) and Manski (2020) applied the principle of partial identification to the infection rate and antibody tests, respectively; Chernozhukov et al. (2020) used the US state-level
data to study determinants of social distancing behavior.
Across a wide spectrum of research, there is a rapidly emerging strand of literature based
on a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and its variants (e.g., Hethcote, 2000, for a
review of the SIR and related models). Many economists have embraced the SIR-type models
as new tools to study the COVID-19 pandemic. Avery et al. (2020) provided a review of the
SIR models for economists, calling for new research in economics. A variety of economic
models and policy simulations have been built on the SIR-type models. See Acemoglu et al.
(2020), Alvarez et al. (2020), Atkeson (2020), Eichenbaum et al. (2020), Pindyck (2020), Stock
(2020), Kim et al. (2020), and Toda (2020) among many others.
One of central parameters in the SIR-type models is the contact rate, typically denoted
by β.2 It measures “the average number of adequate contacts (i.e., contacts sufficient for
transmission) of a person per unit time” (Hethcote, 2000). The contact number β/γ is the
product between β and the average infectious period, denoted by 1/γ; the contact number
is interpreted as “the average number of adequate contacts of a typical infective during the
infectious period” (Hethcote, 2000).
The goal of this paper is to estimate the time-varying COVID-19 contact rate, say βt . In
canonical SIR models, β is a time-constant parameter. However, it may vary over time due
to multiple factors. For example, as pointed by Stock (2020), self-isolation, social distancing and lockdown may reduce β. To estimate a SIR-type model, Fernández-Villaverde and
Jones (2020) allowed for a time-varying contact rate to reflect behavioral and policy-induced
changes associated with social distancing. In particular, they estimated βt using data on
deaths at city, state and country levels. Their main focus was to simulate future outcomes
for many cities, states and countries.
Researchers have also adopted nonlinear time-series models from the econometric toolbox. For example, Li and Linton (2020) analyzed the daily data on the number of new cases
and the number of new deaths with a quadratic time trend model in logs. Their main purpose was to estimate the peak of the pandemic. Liu et al. (2020) studied the density forecasts

of the daily number of active infections for a panel of countries/regions. They modeled
the growth rate of active infections as autoregressive fluctuations around a piecewise linear
trend with a single break. Hartl et al. (2020) used a linear trend model in logs with a trend
break to fit German confirmed cases. Harvey and Kattuman (2020) used a Gompertz model
with a time-varying trend to fit and forecast German and UK new cases and deaths.
In this paper, we aim to synthesize the time-varying contact rate with nonparametric
time series modeling. Especially, we build a new nonparametric regression model for βt that
allows for a piecewise linear trend with multiple kinks at unknown dates. We analyze daily
data from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (Dong et al.,
2020, JHU CSSE) and suggest a particular transformation of data that can be regarded as a
noisy measurement of time-varying βt . Our measurement of βt , which is constructed from
daily data on confirmed, recovered and deceased cases, is different from that of FernándezVillaverde and Jones (2020) who used only death data. We believe both measurements are
complements to each other. However, the SIR model is at best a first-order approximation
to the real world; a raw series of βt would be too noisy to draw on inferences regarding the
underlying contact rate. In fact, the raw series exhibits high degrees of skewness and timevarying volatility even after the log transformation.
To extract the time-varying signal from the noisy measurements, we consider nonparametric trend filters that produce possibly multiple kinks in βt where the kinks are induced
by government policies and changes in individual behavior. A natural candidate method
that yields the kinks is `1 trend filtering (e.g., Kim et al., 2009). However, `1 trend filtering is
akin to LASSO; hence, it may have a problem of producing too many kinks, just like LASSO
selects too many covariates. In view of this concern, we propose a novel filtering method by
adding a constraint on the maximum number of kinks to the popular Hodrick and Prescott
(1997) (HP) filter. It turns out that this method produces a smaller number of the kink points
than `1 trend filtering when both methods fit data equally well. In view of that, we call our
new method the sparse HP filter. We find that the estimated kinks are well aligned with actual events in each country. To document and monitor outbreaks of COVID-19, we propose
to use piecewise constant contact growth rates using the piecewise linear trend estimates from
the sparse HP filter. They provide not only an informative summary of past outbreaks but
also a useful surveillance measure.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe a simple
time series model of the time-varying contact rate. In Section 3, we introduce two classes of
filtering methods. In Section 4, we have a first look at the US data, as a benchmark country.
In Section 5, we present empirical results for five countries: Canada, China, South Korea, the
UK and the US. In Section 6, we establish risk consistency of both the sparse HP and `1 trend
filters. Section 7 concludes and appendices include additional materials. The replication
R codes for the empirical results are available at https://github.com/yshin12/sparseHP.

Finally, we add the caveat that the empirical analysis in the paper was carried out in midJune using daily observations up to June 8th. As a result, some remarks and analysis might
be out of sync with the COVID-19 pandemic in real time.

2

A Time Series Model of the COVID-19 Contact Rate

In this section, we develop a time-series model of the contact rate. Our model specification
is inspired by the classical SIR model which has been adopted by many economists in the
current coronavirus pandemic.
We start with a discrete version of the SIR model, augmented with deaths, adopted from
Pindyck (2020):
∆It = βSt−1 It−1 − γIt−1 ,
∆Dt = γd It−1 ,
∆Rt = γr It−1 ,

(2.1)

1 = St + It + Dt + Rt ,
γ = γr + γd ,
where the (initial) population size is normalized to be 1, St is the proportion of the population
that is susceptible, It the fraction infected, Dt the proportion that have died, and Rt the
fraction that have recovered. The parameter γ = γr + γd governs the rate at which infectives
transfer to the state of being deceased or recovered.
In the emerging economics literature on COVID-19, the contact rate β is viewed as the
parameter that can be affected by changes in individual behavior and government policies
through social distancing and lockdown. We follow this literature and let β = βt be timevarying.
Let Ct be the proportion of confirmed cases, that is Ct = It + Rt + Dt . In words, the
confirmed cases consist of actively infected, recovered and deceased cases. Use the equations
in (2.1) to obtain
βt = Yt :=

∆Ct
.
It−1 St−1

(2.2)

Assume that we have daily data on ∆Ct , ∆Rt and ∆Dt . From these, we can construct cumulative Ct , Rt and Dt . Then St = 1 − Ct and It = Ct − Rt − Dt . This means that we can obtain
time series of βt from Yt . We formally assume this in the following.
Assumption 1 (Data). For each t, we observe (Ct , Rt , Dt ).
By Assumption 1, we can construct Yt = ∆Ct /(It−1 St−1 ). Assumption 1 is a key assump3

tion in the paper. We use daily data from JHU CSSE and they are subject to measurement
errors, which could bias our estimates. In Appendix A, we show that the time series model
given in this section is robust to some degree of under-reporting of confirmed cases. However, our estimates are likely to be biased if the underreporting is time-varying. For example,
this could happen because testing capacity in many countries has expanded over the time
period. Nonetheless, we believe that our measurement of Yt primarily captures the genuine underlying trend of βt . Moreover, because the SIR model in (2.1) is at best a first-order
approximation, a raw series of Yt would be too noisy to be used as the actual series of the
underlying contact rate βt . In other words, βt 6= Yt in actual data and it would be natural
to include an error term in Yt . Because βt has to be positive, we adopt a multiplicative error
structure and make the following assumption.
Assumption 2 (Time-Varying Signal plus Regression Error). For each t, the unobserved random
variable βt satisfies
log Yt = log βt + ut ,
where the error term ut has the following properties:
1. E[ut |Ft−1 ] = 0, where Ft−1 is the natural filtration at time t − 1,
2. E[u2t |Ft−1 ] = σt2 > 0 for some time-varying conditional variance σt2 .
Define
yt := log(∆Ct ) − log(It−1 ) − log St−1 .

(2.3)

Under Assumption 2, (2.2) can be rewritten as
yt = log βt + ut ,

(2.4)

The time-varying parameter log βt would not be identified without further restrictions. Because it is likely to be affected by government policies and cannot change too rapidly, we will
assume that it follows a piecewise trend:
Assumption 3 (Piecewise Trend). The time-varying parameter f0,t := log βt follows a piecewise
trend with at most κ kinks, where the set of kinks is defined by {t = 1, ..., T : f0,t − f0,t−1 6=
f0,t+1 − f0,t } and the locations of kinks are unknown.
The main goal of this paper is to estimate log βt and its kinks under Assumptions 1, 2 and
3.

Filtering the COVID-19 Contact Rate

We consider two different classes of trend filtering methods to produce piecewise estimators
of f0,t := log βt . The first class is based on `1 trend filtering, which has become popular
recently. See, e.g., Kim et al. (2009), Tibshirani (2014), and Wang et al. (2016) among others.
The starting point of the second class is the HP filter, which has been popular in macroeconomics and has been frequently used to separate trend from cycle. The standard convention
in the literature is to set λ = 1600 for quarterly time series. For example, Ravn and Uhlig (2002) suggested a method for adjusting the HP filter for the frequency of observations;
de Jong and Sakarya (2016) and Cornea-Madeira (2017) established some representation results; Hamilton (2018) provided criticism on the HP filter; Phillips and Shi (2019) advocated
a boosted version of the HP filter via L2 -boosting (Bühlmann and Yu, 2003) that can detect
multiple structural breaks. We view that the kinks might be more suitable than the breaks
for modelling βt using daily data. It is unlikely that in a few days, the degree of contagion
of COVID-19 would be diminished with an abrupt jump by social distancing and lockdown.
The original HP filter cannot produce any kink just as ridge regression does not select any
variable. We build the sparse HP filter by drawing on the recent literature that uses an `0 constraint or -penalty (see, e.g. Bertsimas et al., 2016; Chen and Lee, 2018, 2020; Huang et al.,
2018).

3.1 `1 Trend Filtering
In `1 trend filtering, the trend estimate ft is a minimizer of
T

(yt − ft )2 + λ

(ft−1 − 2ft + ft+1 )2 .

(3.2)

t=2

In this paper, the main interest is to find the kinks in the trend. For that purpose, `1 trend
filtering is more suitable than the HP filtering. The main difficulty of using (3.1) is the choice
of λ. This is especially challenging since the time series behavior of yt is largely unknown.
The `1 trend filter is akin to LASSO. In view of an analogy to square-root LASSO (Belloni

5

et al., 2011), it might be useful to consider a square-root variant of (3.1):
T

t=1

|ft−1 − 2ft + ft+1 |.

(3.3)

t=2

We will call (3.3) square-root `1 trend filtering. Both (3.1) and (3.3) can be solved via convex
optimization software, e.g., CVXR (Fu et al., 2017).

3.2

Sparse Hodrick-Prescott Trend Filtering

As an alternative to `1 trend filtering, we may exploit Assumption 3 and consider an `0 constrained version of trend flitering:
T
X

(yt − ft )2

t=1

(3.4)

subject to
T
−1
X

1{ft − ft−1 6= ft+1 − ft } ≤ κ.

t=2

The formulation in (3.4) is related to the method called best subset selection (see, e.g. Bertsimas et al., 2016; Chen and Lee, 2018). It requires only the input of κ. However, because of
the nature of the `0 -(pseudo)norm, it would not work well if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
is low (Hastie et al., 2017; Mazumder et al., 2017). This is likely to be a concern for our measurement of the log contact rate.
To regularize the best subset selection procedure, it has been suggested in the literature that (3.4) can be combined with `1 or `2 penalization (Bertsimas and Van Parys, 2020;
Mazumder et al., 2017). We adopt Bertsimas and Van Parys (2020) and propose an `0 -constrained
version of the Hodrick-Prescott filter:
T

(yt − ft ) + λ

t=1

t=2

(3.5)

subject to
T
−1
X

1{ft − ft−1 6= ft+1 − ft } ≤ κ.

t=2

As in (3.4), the tuning parameter κ controls how many kinks are allowed for. Thus, we have
a direct control of the resulting segments of different slopes. The `2 penalty term is useful to
deal with the low SNR problem with the COVID 19 data. We will call (3.5) sparse HP trend
filtering.

Problem (3.5) can be solved by mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP). Rewrite
the objective function in (3.5) as

PT −1
t=2

zt ≤ κ, and

− M zt ≤ ft−1 − 2ft + ft+1 ≤ M zt , t = 2, . . . , T − 1.
This is called a big-M formulation that requires that
max |ft−1 − 2ft + ft+1 | ≤ M.
t

We need to choose the auxiliary parameters f , f and M . We set f = min yt and f = max yt .
One simple practical method for choosing M is to set
M=

max

t=2,...,T −1

|yt−1 − 2yt + yt+1 |.

(3.6)

To implement the proposed method, it is simpler to write the MIQP problem above in
matrix notation. Let y denote the (T × 1) vector of yt ’s and 1 a vector of 1’s whose dimension
may vary. We solve
h
i
min (y − f )> (y − f ) + λf > D > Df
f ,z

(3.7)

subject to z ∈ {0, 1}T −2 , f 1 ≤ f ≤ f 1, 1> z ≤ κ, −M z ≤ Df ≤ M z, where D is the
(T − 2) × T second-order difference matrix such that

with entries not shown above being zero. Let fb and zb denote the resulting maximizers. It
is straightforward to see that fb also solves (3.5). Therefore, fb is the (T × 1) vector of trend
b := {t = 2, . . . , T − 1 : zbt = 1} is the index set of estimated kinks. The
estimates and K
MIQP problem can be solved via modern mixed integer programming software, e.g., Gurobi.
Because the sample size for yt is typically less than 100, the computational speed of MIQP

7

is fast enough to carry out cross-validation to select tuning parameters. We summarize the
equivalence between the original and MIQP formulation in the following proposition.
Proposition 3.1. Define
F(κ) := {f = (f1 , . . . , fT ) : min ft ≥ f , max ft ≤ f , max |ft−1 − 2ft + ft+1 | ≤ M,

Let fbSHP : {fbt : t = 1, . . . , T } denote a solution to
min ST (f , λ) := (y − f )> (y − f ) + λf > D > Df .

f ∈F(κ)

Let fbMIQP denote a solution to (3.7). Then, both fbSHP and fbMIQP are equivalent in the sense that
fbSHP ∈ F(κ), fbMIQP ∈ F(κ), and ST (fbSHP , λ) = ST (fbMIQP , λ).

3.3

Selection of Tuning Parameters

We first consider the sparse HP filter. There are two tuning parameters: λ and κ. It is likely
that there will be an initial stage of coronavirus spread, followed by lockdown or social distancing. Even without any policy intervention, it will come down since many people will
voluntarily select into self-isolation and there is a chance of herd immunity. Hence, the minimum κ is at least 1. If κ is too large, it is difficult to interpret the resulting kinks. In view of
these, we set the possible values κ ∈ K = {2, 3, 4}. For each pair of (κ, λ), let fb−s (κ, λ) denote
the leave-one-out estimator of fs . That is, it is the sparse HP filter estimate by solving:

where L is the set for possible values of λ. We view λ as an auxiliary tuning parameter that
mitigates the low SNR problem. Hence, we take L to be in the range of relatively smaller
values than the typical values used for the HP filter. In the numerical work, we let Λ to a grid
of equi-spaced points in the log2 -scale.
We now turn to the HP, `1 and square-root `1 trend filters. For each filter, we choose λ
P
such that the fidelity term Tt=1 (yt −ft )2 is the same as that of the sparse HP filter. In this way,
we can compare different methods holding the same level of fitting the data. Alternatively,
we may choose λ by leave-one-out cross validation for each filtering method. However, in
that case, it would be more difficult to make a comparison across different methods. Since
our main focus is to find the kinks in the contact rate, we will fine-tune all the filters to have
P
the same level of Tt=1 (yt − ft )2 based on the sparse HP filter’s cross validation result.

A First Look at the Time-Varying Contact Rate

As a benchmark, we have a first look at the US data. The dataset is obtained via R package coronavirus (Krispin, 2020), which provides a daily summary of COVID-19 cases from
Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (Dong et al., 2020).
Following Liu et al. (2020), we set the first date of the analysis to begin when the number
of cumulative cases reaches 100 (that is, March 4 for the US). To smooth data minimally, we
take Yt in (2.2) to be a three-day simple moving average: that is, Yt = (Y̆t + Y̆t−1 + Y̆t−2 )/3,
where Y̆t is the daily observation of Yt constructed from the dataset.3 Then, we take the log
to obtain yt = log Yt .
Figure 1 has four panels. The top-left panel shows the fraction of daily positives, the topright panel the fraction of lagged cumulative infectives, the bottom-left panel the fraction
of lagged cumulative susceptibles, and the bottom-right Yt = ∆Ct /(It−1 St−1 ). In the US,
statewide stay-at-home orders started in California on March 20 and extended to 30 states by
March 30 (The New York Times, 2020d). The inserted vertical line in the figure corresponds
to March 30, which we will call the “lockdown” date for simplicity, although there was no
lockdown at the national level. As a noisy measurement of βt , Yt shows enormous skewness and fluctuations especially in the beginning of the study period. This indicates that the
signal-to-noise ratio is high and is time-varying as well. This pattern of the data has motivated Assumption 2. Because St−1 is virtually one throughout the analysis period (0.994 on
June 8, which is the last date of the sample), Yt ≈ ∆Ct /It−1 , which is daily positives divided
by the lagged infectives.
Figure 2 shows the raw data along with parametric fitting. The top-left panel shows the
logarithm of Yt , which still exhibits some degree of skewness and time-varying variance. The
3

Liu et al. (2020) used one-sided three-day rolling averages; Fernández-Villaverde and Jones (2020) took 5-day
centered moving averages.

fitted regression line is based on the following parametric regression model:
yt = α0 + α1 (t − t0 )1(t > t0 ) + εt ,

(4.1)

where t0 is March 30. The simple idea behind (4.1) is that an initial, time-constant contact
rate began to diminish over time after a majority of US states imposed stay-at-home orders.
In simple SIR models, the contact number β/γ is identical to the basic reproduction number denoted by R0 , which is viewed as a key threshold quantity in the sense that “an infection
can get started in a fully susceptible population if and only if R0 > 1 for many deterministic
epidemiology models” (Hethcote, 2000). Since βt is time-varying in our framework, we may
define a time-varying basic reproduction number by R0 (t) := βt /γ.
The top-right panel shows the estimates of time-varying R0 (t):4
b0 (t) := exp[b
R
α0 + α
b1 (t − t0 )1(t > t0 )]/γ,

(4.2)

where γ = 1/18 is taken from Acemoglu et al. (2020). This corresponds to 18 days of the
average infectious period. The parametric estimates of R0 (t) started above 4 and reached
0.15 at the end of the sample period.
The left-bottom panel shows the residual plot in terms of yt and the right-bottom panel
the residual plot in terms of R0 (t). In both panels, the estimated residuals seem to be biased
and show autocorrelation. Especially, the positive values of residuals at the end of the sample
period is worrisome because the resulting prediction would be too optimistic.

Estimation Results

In this section, we present estimation results for five countries: Canada, China, South Korea,
the UK and the US. These countries are not meant to be a random sample of the world; they
are selected based on our familiarity with them so that we can interpret the estimated kinks
with narratives. We look at the US as a benchmark country and provide a detailed analysis
in Section 5.1. A condensed version of the estimation results for other countries are provided
in Section 5.2.

Figure 3 summarizes the results of leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) as described in
Section 3.3. The range of tuning parameters were: κ ∈ {2, 3, 4} and λ = {20 , 21 , . . . , 25 }. We

The formula given in (4.2) is valid if errors are homoskedastic, which is unlikely to be true in actual data.
However, we present (4.2) here because it is simpler. Our main analysis focuses on estimation of the kinks based
on yt , not on estimating R0 (t). We use the latter mainly to appreciate the magnitude of the kinks.

Based on the tuning parameter selection in Figure 3, we show estimation results for the
sparse HP filter in Figure 4. The structure of Figure 4 is similar to that of Figure 2. The
top-left panel shows estimates of the sparse HP filter along with the raw series of yt and
the parametric estimates shown in Figure 2. The top-right panel displays counterparts in
terms of R0 (t). The bottom panels exhibit residual plots for the log βt and R0 (t) scales. The
trend estimates from the sparse HP filter fit the data much better than the simple parametric
estimates. The estimated kink dates are: March 16, March 20, April 14, and May 13. There
are five periods based on them.
1. March 4 - March 16: this period corresponds to the initial epidemic stage;
2. March 16 - March 20: the contact rate was peaked at the end of this period;
3. March 20 - April 14: a sharp decrease of the contact rate is striking;
4. April 14 - May 13: the contact rate decreased but less steeply;
5. May 13 - June 8: it continued to go down but its slope got more flattened.

Note: The grey curve in each panel represents the data yt . Sparse HP filtering solves (3.5) and the parametric

April 14, and May 13. The orange vertical line denotes the lockdown date, March 30.

To provide narratives on these dates, President Trump declared a national emergency on
March 13; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended no gatherings of 50 or more people on March 15; New York City’s public schools system announced
that it would close on March 16; and California started stay-at-home orders on March 20
(The New York Times, 2020b,d). These events indicate that the second period was indeed
the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US. The impact of social distancing and stay-athome orders across a majority of states is clearly visible in the third period. The fourth and
fifth periods include state reopening: for example, stay-at-home order expired in Georgia
and Texas on April 30; in Florida on May 4; in Massachusetts on May 18; in New York on
May 28 (The New York Times, 2020c). In short, unlike the parametric model with a single
kink, the nonparametric trend estimates detect multiple changes in the slopes and provide
kink dates, which are well aligned with the actual events.
We now turn to different filtering methods. In Figure 5, we show selection of λ for the
HP, `1 and square-root `1 filters. As explained in Section 3.3, the penalization parameter λ is
chosen to ensure that all different methods have the same level of fitting the data. Figure 6
shows the estimation results for the HP filter. The HP trend estimates trace data pretty well
after late March, as clear in residual plots. However, there is no kink in the estimates due to
the nature of the `2 penalty term in the HP filter. The tuning parameter was λ = 30, which
is 30 times as large as the one used in the sparse HP filter. This is because for the HP filter,
λ is the main tuning parameter; however, for the sparse HP filter, λ plays a minor role of
regularizing the `0 constrained method.

|∆2 log βbt | > η, where ∆2 is the double difference operator and η = 10−6 is an effective zero.5
The tuning parameter λ = 0.9 was chosen by minimizing the distance between the fidelity
of `1 and that of the Sparse HP. Recall that the sparse HP filter produces the kinks on March
16, March 20, April 14, and May 13. In other words, the `1 filter estimates 6 more kinks
than the sparse HP filter when both fit the data equally well. It is unlikely that two adjacent
dates (March 15-16 and March 20-21) correspond to two different regimes in the time-varying
contact rate. This suggests that the `1 filter may over-estimate the number of kinks. Figure 8
shows estimation results for the square-root `1 trend filters. The chosen λ = 0.5 was smaller
than that of the `1 trend filter due to the change in the scale of the fidelity term; however, the
trend estimates look very similar and the estimated kinks are identical between the `1 and
square-root `1 trend filters. In Figure 9, we plot the sparse HP filter estimates along with `1
filter estimates. Both methods have produced very similar trend estimates, but the number
of kinks is substantially different: only 4 kinks for the sparse HP filter but 10 kinks for the `1
filter.

5.2

Other Countries: Canada, China, South Korea and the UK

In this section, we provide condensed estimation results for other countries. We focus on
the sparse HP and `1 filters whose tuning parameters are chosen as in the previous section.
Appendices B and C contain the details of the selection of tuning parameters.
Figure 10 shows the empirical results of Canada. The estimated kink dates are: March 18
and April 11. Based on them, we can classify observations into three periods:
1. March 6 - March 18: This is an initial period of the epidemic in Canada. The contact
rate was peaked at the end of this period. Several lockdown measures started to be
imposed.
2. March 18 - April 11: We observe a sharp decrease in the contact rate in this period.
Additional measures were imposed.
3. April 11 - June 8: The contact rate decreased but less steeply.
Quebec and Ontario are the two provinces hardest hit by COVID-19. In Quebec, daycares,
public schools, and universities are closed on March 13 followed by non-essential businesses
and public gathering places on March 15. Montreal declared state of emergency on March 27
(CTV News, 2020). Similarly, all public schools in Ontario are closed on March 12. The state
of emergency was announced in Ontario on March 17 and ordered to close all non-essential
5
The results are robust to the size of the effective zero and do not change even if we set η = 10−3 . Gurobi used
for the Sparse HP filtering also imposes some effective zeros in various constraints. We use the default values
of them. For example, the integer tolerance level and the general feasibility tolerance level are 10−5 and 10−6 ,
respectively.

businesses on March 23 (Global News, 2020). We set the lockdown date in Canada on March
13 as other provincial governments as well as the federal government started to recommend
the social distancing measures strongly along with the cancellation of various events on the
date (CBC News, 2020). These tight lockdown and social distancing measures seemed to contribute the sharp decline of the contact rate in the second period. Both governments started
to announce the plans to lift the lockdown measures at the end of April, which corresponds
to the third period. Lockdown fatigue would also cause the slower decrease of the contact
rate. In sum, a series of social distancing measures have been effective to decrease the contact rate but with some lags. The sparse HP filtering separates these periods reasonably well.
However, the `1 filtering overfits the model with 5 kinks.

Figure 11 shows the results for China. Since the pandemic is almost over in China, we
use the data censored on April 26th when the 3-day-average of newly confirmed cases is less
than 10. The estimated kink dates are: January 28, March 14, March 24, and April 18. Based
on them, we can classify observations into five periods:
21

1. January 23 - January 28: This is an initial period of the epidemic in China. Since the official confirmation of the novel coronavirus on December 31, 2019, the confirmed cases
had increased rapidly. President Xi presided and issued instructions on the epidemic
control on January 20. The travel ban on Wuhan was imposed on January 23, 2020 in
the period of the Lunar New Year holidays (The New York Times, 2020b). We set this
date as the lockdown date.
2. January 28 - March 14: The contact rate shows a sharp decrease during this period.
The Lunar New Year holiday was extended to February 2 across the country. China’s
National Health Commission (NHC) imposed social distancing measures on January
26. By January 29, all 31 provinces in China upgraded the public health emergency response to the most serious level. By early February, nationwide strict social distancing
policies were in place.
3. March 14 - March 24: This period shows a V-turn of the contact rate in terms of the log βt
scale. It also shows an upward trending in the R0 (t) scale but the level is lower than
that in early February. The mass quarantine of Wuhan was partially lifted on March
19 (Bloomberg, 2020). Most provinces downgraded their public health emergency response level, where factories and stores started to reopen in this period.
4. March 24 - April 18: The contact rate still increased but at a lower rate. It started to
decrease again at the end of this period. We can see a slight increase in R0 (t). The mass
quarantine of Wuhan was lifted more and the travel to other provinces was allowed on
April 8 (Bloomberg, 2020).
5. April 18 - April 26: The contact rate went down quickly and was flattened at a low level.
The last hospitalized Covid-19 patient in Wuhan was discharged on April 26 (Xinhua,
2020).
Figure 12 shows the results for South Korea. For the same reason in China, we use the
data censored on April 29. The estimated kink dates are: March 3, March 15, April 2, and
April 21. Based on them, we can classify observations into five periods:
1. February 21 - March 3: This period is the beginning of the coronavirus spread in South
Korea. On February 21, Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive church in South Korea
was linked to a surge of infections in the country (The New York Times, 2020b). The
sharp decline of log βt could be due to the fact that the number of active infections is
relatively small in this period and thus, Yt = ∆Ct /(It−1 St−1 ) might not be properly
measured.
2. March 3 - March 15: A sharp decrease in log βt in this period corresponds to Korean
government’s swift reactions to the outbreak through active testing and contact tracing

3. March 15 - April 2: This period shows a modest V-turn of the contact rate in terms of
the log βt scale but it is much less visible in the R0 (t) scale.
4. April 2 - April 21: This period displays a further reduction of the contact rate. A remarkable event was parliamentary elections on April 15 when 30 million people voted
without triggering a new outbreak.
5. April 21 - April 29: The contact rate was flattened at a low level.

Figure 13 shows the empirical results of the UK. The estimated kink dates are: March 12
and March 14. Based on them, we can classify observations into three periods:
24

1. March 6 - March 12: This is an initial period of the epidemic in the UK. The downward trend might be due to the fact that the cumulative number of confirmed cases is
relatively small and therefore, its growth rate can be easily over-estimated.
2. March 12 - March 14: This is still an early stage of the epidemic. The steep increase in
the contact rate is again possibly due to the small number of the confirmed cases.
3. March 14 - June 8: This period shows a steady and constant decrease in the contact rate.
The lockdown measures began in the UK on March 23 (BBC News, 2020b). On May 10,
the British prime minister Boris Johnson relaxed certain restrictions and announced the
plan for reopening (BBC News, 2020a) but it keeps the downward trending.
Overall, the trend of the contact rate is quite similar to those of the US and Canada. The
location of the kinks are around more in the initial periods but it shows the steady downward
trending after the prime minister’s lockdown announcement. This results in a smooth curve
in the R0 (t) scale. The trend estimates of the `1 filter is almost identical to those of the sparse
HP filter; however, it indicates 10 kinks, which seem overly excessive.

5.3

A Measure of Surveillance and Policy Implications

The sparse HP filter produces the kinks where the slope changes in the log βt scale, thereby
providing a good surveillance measure for monitoring the ongoing epidemic situation. The
policy responses are based on various scenarios and the contact rate is one of the most important measures that determine different developments. As a summary statistic of the timevarying contact rate, we propose to consider the time-varying growth rate of the contact rate,
which we call contact growth rates:
ξ(t) :=

βt − βt−1
× 100.
βt−1

Recall that we have defined the time-varying basic reproduction number by R0 (t) = βt /γ.
Because γ is fixed over time, we have that
ξ(t) =

R0 (t) − R0 (t − 1)
× 100.
R0 (t − 1)

Therefore, ξ(t) can be interpreted as the time-varying growth rate of the basic reproduction number; it does not require the knowledge of γ and solely depends on βt . Furthermore, by simple
algebra,
ξ(t) = [exp(log βt − log βt−1 ) − 1] × 100,

Note: The growth rates, expressed as percentages, are obtained by (5.1) using the sparse HP trend estimates.
The contact growth rates are also growth rates of R0 (t). The kink dates separating distinct periods are different
for each country and they are reported in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.

which implies that ξ(t) will be piecewise constant if log βt is piecewise linear. This simple
algebraic relationship shows that a change in the slope at the kink in the log βt scale is translated to a break in the time-varying contact growth rates and therefore in growth rates of the
time-varying basic reproduction number. When ξ(t) is a large positive number, that will be
a warning signal for the policymakers. On the contrary, if ξ(t) is a big negative number, that
may suggest that policy measures imposed before are effective to reduce the contagion.
Table 1 reports the time-varying contact growth rates in the five countries that we investigate, using the sparse HP trend estimates. For the US, the explosive growth rate of 7.5% in
the second period is followed by the negative growth rates of −7.7%, −3.4%, and −1%, albeit
at diminishing magnitudes. The trajectory of Canada is similar to that of the US. The growth
rates of China fluctuated up and down: it started with a high positive 15% followed by −12%;
a sharp V-turn at the end of the second period (March 14) with the resulting explosive growth
rate of 30%, followed by moderate 4% and impressive −23%. It might be the case that the
up-and-down pattern observed in China is in part due to data quality issues since China
was the first country to experience the pandemic. For South Korea, we can see the stunning
drop of the growth rates culminating on March 15 (the end of the second period). A modest positive growth rate during period 3 is offset by a larger magnitude of negative growth
rate in period 4. The UK has experienced steady—but not spectacular—negative growths
over the sample period following a sharp fluctuation in mid-March. This hints the degrees
of effectiveness of the UK lockdown policy. As early pandemic epicenters, China and South
Korea experienced V-turns in the time-varying growth rates of basic reproduction number.
Canada, the UK and the US may face similar trajectories as they reopen their countries. Our
surveillance statistic can be a useful indicator to monitor a new outbreak of COVID-19. However, it will be mainly useful for a short-term projection of the contact growth rate because it
is not designed to make long-term trend predictions.

Theory

In this section, we examine theoretical properties of the sparse HP and `1 filters in terms of
risk consistency. Let k · k0 denote the usual `0 -(pseudo)norm, that is the number of nonzero
elements, and let k · kr and k · k∞ , respectively, denote the `r norm for r = 1, 2 and the
sup-norm.

F = F(κ, M ) := {f : kDf k0 ≤ κ, kDf k∞ ≤ M } ,

(6.1)

where M is defined in (3.6). For each f ∈ F, define

S(f ) := Ey

Let f ∗ denote the ideal sparse filter in the sense that
f ∗ ∈ argminf ∈F S(f ).
Let fb denote the sparse HP filter defined in Section 3.2. Then,
R(fb, f ∗ ) := S(fb) − S(f ∗ )

(6.2)

is always nonnegative. Following the literature on empirical risk minimization, we bound
the excess risk R in (6.2) and establish conditions under which it converges to zero.
Recall that the sparse HP filter minimizes
Qn (f ) :=

subject to f ∈ F.
Let Sn (f ) := T −1 (y − f )> (y − f ). Write
R(fb, f ∗ ) = S(fb) − Qn (f ∗ ) + Qn (f ∗ ) − S(f ∗ )
≤ S(fb) − Qn (fb) + Qn (f ∗ ) − S(f ∗ )

We summarize discussions above in the following lemma.
Lemma 6.1. Let fb denote the sparse HP filter. Then,

To derive an asymptotic result, we introduce subscripts indexed by the sample size T ,
when necessary for clarification. Let Gκ denote the set of every continuous and piecewise
linear function whose slopes and the function itself is bounded by C1 and C2 , respectively,
and the number of kinks is bounded by κ.
Assumption 4. Assume that F in (6.1) satisfies
F(κ, M ) ⊆ FT := {fT = (fT,1 , ..., fT,T ) : fT,t = f (t/T ), f ∈ Gκ } .

some p ≥ 2 and Assumption 2. Finally, λκT −(1−1/p) → 0 as T → ∞.
Then, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 6.1. Let Assumption 4 hold. Then, we have that as T → ∞,

T t=2,...,T −1

(6.5)

Therefore, R(fb, f ∗ ) →P 0.
Theorem 6.1 establishes the consistency in terms of the excess risk R. Assumption 4
provides sufficient conditions for (6.4) and (6.5). Condition (6.4) is a uniform law of large
numbers for the class F and condition (6.5) imposes a weak condition on λ. Proposition 6.1
follows immediately from Lemma 6.1 once (6.4) and (6.5) are established.

29

Proof of Proposition 6.1. Note that the summand in (6.4) can be rewritten (yt2 − Eyt2 ) − 2ft (yt −
∗ − f )u and 2f (y − Ey ) = 2f u . Furthermore,

6.2

Risk Consistency of the `1 Filter

The `1 trend filtering (3.1) can be expressed as
fe := arg min ky − f k22 + λkDf k1 .
f ∈RT

We now derive the deviation bound for kfe−f ∗ k2 . First, the problem is equivalent to a regular
LASSO problem as stated in Lemma 6.2 below.
Write D = (D3 , D2 ) where D2 has two columns. Additionally, write
G2 :=

D3−1

!

0

,

g1 :=

−D3−1 D2

!
,

where 0 is 2 × (T − 2), g1 is T × 2 and G2 is T × (T − 2). Let Pg1 = g1 (g1> g1 )−1 g1> .
b where ye := (I − Pg )y, X
fθ,
f := (I − Pg )G2 and
Lemma 6.2. We have fe = y − ye + X

Proof of Lemma 6.2. Let D1 = (0 : I2 ) be a 2 × T matrix, so that
D

is upper triangular and invertible. Then, G := D̄ −1 = (G2 , g1 ). Then for a generic f ∈ RT ,
we can define
α := D̄f =

So (θ, a) also depend on f and Gα = g1 a + G2 θ. Then the problem is equivalent to: fe =

b + G2 θ,
g1 a
b := min ky − (g1 a + G2 θ)k2 + λkθk1 .
(b

a,θ

To solve the problem, we concentrate out a: Given θ, the optimal a is (g1> g1 )−1 g1> (y − G2 θ)
and the optimal g1 a is Pg1 (y − G2 θ). Substituting, so the problem becomes a regular LASSO

denote the indices of t so that f0,t−1 −f0,t = f0,t −f0,t+1 when t ∈ J. Here, {f0,t : t = 1, . . . , T }
denote the true elements of f . For a generic vector θ ∈ RT −2 , let θJ and θJ c respectively be its

To achieve risk consistency, λ has to be chosen to make the second term on the right-hand

high probability. The first term on the right-hand side of (6.6) will converge to zero under
mild conditions on u. It is reassuring that the `1 trend filter fits COVID-19 data well in our
empirical results.

6.3

Risk Consistency of exp(fbt ) and exp(fet )

In this subsection, we obtain risk consistency of exp(fbt ) and exp(fet ). To do so, we first rewrite
the excess risk in (6.2) as
R(f , f ∗ ) =

T
1X
E(ft − ft∗ )2 ,
T
t=1

for f = (f1 , ..., fT )> and f ∗ = (f1∗ , ..., fT∗ )> . We have proved in the previous sections that
R(fb, f ∗ ) →P 0 and R(fe, f ∗ ) →P 0. Then, under the assumption that there exists a constant
C < ∞ such that maxt |ft | + maxt |ft∗ | < C for all {ft } on the parameter space, we get,
uniformly for all f on the parameter space,

where in the first equality we used the mean value theorem for some f˜t ∈ (ft , ft∗ ). Therefore,
R(exp(fb), exp(f ∗ )) ≤ exp(2C)R(fb, f ∗ ) = oP (1)
and the analogous result folds for exp(fe).

Conclusions

We have developed a novel method to estimate the time-varying COVID-19 contact rate using data on actively infected, recovered and deceased cases. Our preferred method called

32

the sparse HP filter has produced the kinks that are well aligned with actual events in each
of five countries we have examined. We have also proposed contact growth rates to document and monitor outbreaks. Theoretically, we have outlined the basic properties of the
sparse HP and `1 filters in terms of risk consistency. The next step might be to establish a
theoretical result that may distinguish between the two methods by looking at kink selection
consistency. It would also be important to develop a test for presence of kinks as well as an
inference method on the location and magnitude of kinks and on contact growth rates. In
the context of the nonparametric kernel regression of the trend function, Delgado and Hidalgo (2000) explored the distribution theory for the jump estimates but did not offer testing
for the presence of a jump. Compared to the kernel smoothing approach, it is easier to determine the number of kinks using our approach, as we have demonstrated. Furthermore,
the linear trend specification is more suitable for forecasting immediate future outcomes, at
least until the next kink arises. The long-term prediction is more challenging and it is beyond
the scope of this paper. Finally, it would be useful to develop a panel regression model for
the contact rate at the level of city, state or country. These are interesting research topics for
future research.

Appendices
A

Under-Reporting of Positive Cases

In Section 2, it is assumed that we observe (Ct , Rt , Dt ). In this appendix, we show that our
time series model in Section 2 is robust to some degree of under-reporting of positive cases.
Assume that what we observe is only a fraction of changes in Ct . This assumption reflects
the reality that a daily reported number of newly positive cases of COVID-19 is likely to be
underreported. Suppose that we observe ∆ct in period t such that ∆ct := ρ∆Ct , where
0 < ρ < 1 is unknown. Then,
ct =

T
X

∆ct = ρ

t=1

T
X

∆Ct = ρCt ,

t=1

assuming that c0 = C0 = 0. In words, ρ is the constant ratio between reported and true cases.
Formally, we make the following assumption.
Assumption 5 (Fraction Reporting). For each t, we observe (ct , rt , dt ) such that
ct := ρCt , rt := ρRt
where 0 < ρ < 1.
33

and dt := ρDt ,

The two simplifying conditions in Assumption 5 is that (i) ρ is identical among the three
time series and (ii) ρ is constant over time. In reality, a fraction of reported deaths might be
higher than that of reported cases; ρ might be time-varying especially in the beginning of
the pandemic due to capacity constraints in testing. However, we believe that ρ is unlikely to
vary over time as much as βt changes over time; thus, we take a simple approach to minimize
complexity. The common ρ can be thought of a broad measure of detecting COVID-19 in a
community.
Define it := ct − rt − dt and st := 1 − ct . Under Assumption 5, the reported fraction
infected at time t (it ) is underestimated, but the reported fraction of the proportion that is
susceptible at time t (st ) is overestimated. Note that
gt :=

∆ct

∆Ct

it−1
ρIt−1
It−1

However,
st−1 = 1 − ρt−1 Ct−1 6= St−1 .
In words, we have a measurement error problem on st−1 but not on gt . It follows from (2.2)
that the observed gt and st−1 are related by
gt = βt st−1 + vt ,

(A.1)

vt = βt (St−1 − st−1 ) = βt (ρ − 1)Ct−1 .

(A.2)

where

The right-hand side of (A.2) is likely to exhibit an increasing trend since Ct−1 is the cumulative fraction ever infected. To alleviate this problem, we now divide both sides of (A.1) by
ct−1 , which is positive, to obtain
gt


st−1 ρ − 1

(A.3)

On one hand, if ρ = 1, (A.3) is identical to (2.2). On other hand, if ρ → 0, the term inside the
brackets on the right-hand side of (A.3) diverges to infinity.
In the intermediate case, it depends on the relative size between st−1 /ct−1 and (ρ − 1)/ρ.
We now use the UK data to argue that the latter is negligible to the former. According to
the estimate by Office for National Statistics (2020), “an average of 0.25% of the community
population had COVID-19 in England at any given time between 4 May and 17 May 2020
(95% confidence interval: 0.16% to 0.38%).” In the UK data used for estimation, the changes
34

in the number of cumulative positives between 4 May and 17 May 2020 is 0.08% of the UK
population. Then, an estimate of ρ = 0.08/0.25 = 0.32, resulting in (ρ − 1)/ρ = −2.12.
However, the sample maximum, median, minimum values of st−1 /ct−1 are 572412, 804, and
264, respectively. Therefore, the correction term (ρ − 1)/ρ is negligible and therefore, (A.3)
reduces to
gt ≈ βt st−1 ,

(A.4)

which is virtually the same as (2.2).
