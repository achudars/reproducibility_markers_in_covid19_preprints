Abstract
Background and Objectives
The use of computed tomography (CT) in COVID-19 screening is controversial. The
controversy is associated with ambiguous characteristics of chest CT as a diagnostic test.
The reported values of CT sensitivity and especially specificity calculated using reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction as a reference standard vary widely, raising
reasonable doubts about the applicability of the method. The objective of this study was
to reevaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT using an alternative approach.
Methods
This study included 973 symptomatic COVID-19 patients aged 42 ± 17 years, 56%
females. For all of them, we reviewed the disease dynamics between the initial and
follow-up CT studies using a “CT0-4” visual semi-quantitative grading system to assess
the severity of the disease. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated as conditional
probabilities that a patient’s condition would improve or deteriorate, depending on the
results of the initial CT examination. For the calculation of negative (NPV) and
positive (PPV) predictive values, we estimated the COVID-19 prevalence in Moscow.
The data on total cases of COVID-19 from March 6, 2020, to July 20, 2020, were taken
from the Rospotrebnadzor website. We used several ARIMA and EST models with
different parameters to fit the data and forecast the incidence.
Results
The “CT0-4” grading scale demonstrated low sensitivity (28%), but high specificity
(95%). The best statistical model for describing the epidemiological situation in Moscow
was ETS with multiplicative trend, error, and season type. According to our
calculations, with the predicted prevalence of 2.1%, the values of NPV and PPV would
be 98% and 10%, correspondingly.
Discussion
We associate the low sensitivity and PPV values of the “CT0-4” grading scale with the
small sample size of the patients with severe symptoms and non-optimal methodological
setup for measuring these specific characteristics. We found that the grading scale was
highly specific and predictive for identifying admissions to hospitals of COVID-19
patients. Despite the ambiguous accuracy, chest CT proved to be an effective practical

tool for patient management during the pandemic, provided that the necessary
infrastructure and human resources are available.

Introduction
As of July 3, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to more than 11 million confirmed
cases globally, with nearly 525,000 deaths [1]. COVID-19 has a range of disease
presentations. It may be completely asymptomatic or manifest itself with mild flu-like
symptoms (80% of infections), and there are severe and critical conditions requiring
oxygen or ventilation (15% and 5%, correspondingly) [2]. It is essential to control the
disease spreading, but the variability of the symptoms makes the task of diagnosing
COVID-19 very challenging. The availability of rapid and accurate COVID-19 testing
tools becomes a critical factor in reducing human-to-human SARS-CoV-2 transition.
Currently, commercially available COVID-19 tests fall into two major categories: (i)
assays detecting viral RNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or nucleic acid
hybridization, and (ii) serological and immunological assays detecting antibodies
produced by individuals [3]. Despite constant improvement and evolving, both
categories have their disadvantages. For example, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
requires expensive equipment, highly trained operators, and can take days to provide
results. As for the serological tests, there is currently no strong evidence of
seropositivity correlation with immunity to the virus [3]. There remains an urgent
demand for an effective tool for COVID-19 diagnosis, and computed tomography (CT)
provides a promising solution.
CT is sensitive for early parenchymal lung disease, disease progression, and
alternative diagnoses [4]. Moreover, CT results can be obtained within 20 minutes,
which is an essential factor during the pandemic. Nevertheless, there is considerable
controversy regarding the use of CT imaging in COVID-19 diagnostics. The estimates
of the CT chest sensitivity and sensibility vary widely and strongly depend on the
radiologist’s competence (Table S1).
RT-PCR tests, widely used as a reference standard in COVID-19 CT studies, also
have limited diagnostic value. The probability of false-negative RT-PCR result
decreases from 100% on day 1 of infection to 68% on day 4. On day 5 (typical time of
symptom onset), the false-negative rate is 38%, decreasing to 20% on day 8 with the
following increase to 66% on day 21 [5]. The sensitivity of RT-PCR tests might be as
low as 59% [6] and depends on several factors, including individual variability in viral
shedding [7]. It makes the method a sub-optimal reference standard. The objective of
this study was to reevaluate the diagnostic value of CT through repeated scanning of
patients with suspected COVID-19 that were either disposed to home care or
hospitalized. We used a recently reported CT grading scale [8] modified by us [9] to
assess the presence and severity of the disease. According to our results based on
retrospective observations of 973 symptomatic subjects, CT has sensitivity 28%,
specificity 95%, positive predictive value (PPV) 10%, and negative predictive value
(NPV) 98% for identifying admissions to the hospitals of COVID-19 patients. Despite
ambiguous characteristics, CT proved to be an effective practical tool for patient triage
during the pandemic, which can significantly reduce the burden on hospitals.

Materials and Methods
In this retrospective study, we analyzed primary and secondary CT results of individuals
aged from 18 to 80 years examined at the Moscow Outpatient Computed Tomography
Centers (OCTC) from April 4, 2020, to May 18, 2020. The patients eligible for inclusion

2/10

were the subjects with the symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI). The clinical
diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD10 code: U07.2) was based on a combination of the ARI
symptoms and CT results. CT images were acquired with recommended scanning
parameters for standard-size patients (height, 170 cm; weight, 70 kg): voltage 120 kV,
automatic tube current modulation, field of view 350 mm, slice thickness ≤ 1.5 mm.
The CT images were inspected by the radiologists that completed the targeted training
courses on COVID-19 chest imaging. In doubtful cases, the expert opinion of
experienced radiologists was requested at the Moscow Radiology Reference Center.
CT results were categorized by the degree of lung tissue damage using a
standardized template according to the grading scale “CT0-4” [9]. The patients from
the categories CT0, CT1, and CT2, were disposed to home care under telemedicine
guidance. The immediate hospitalization was mandatory for patients of the CT3
category. The CT4 category patients were referred to emergency medical care.
For statistical analysis, we examined whether the CT0-4 category may be associated
with the prognosis for the disease progression, and therefore, the necessity of
hospitalization. For that, we combined the CT results into two groups, the first of
which, named “home,” contained patients of categories CT0-2 (home care), and the
second, named “hospital,” included patients of categories CT3 and CT4 (hospital care).
We considered the dynamics of the study participants between the two groups according
to the results of secondary CT scanning to estimate the specificity and sensitivity of the
grading scale. In our model, sensitivity was described as a conditional probability
Pworse|hospital :

Pworse|hospital =

number of “hospital” patients af ter second CT study
total number of “hospital” patients

(1)

The specificity of the model corresponded to a conditional probability Pbetter|home :
Pbetter|home =

number of “home” patients af ter second CT study
total number of “home” patients

(2)

Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of a test are
affected by the prevalence of the disease. We used Exponential Smoothing (ETS [10])
and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA [11]) models to predict the
COVID-19 incidence in Moscow. The daily data on the total number of COVID-19
cases in the city, covering the period from March 6, 2020, to July 20, 2020, was taken
from the Rospotrebnadzor website [12]. The time series analysis was performed with R
3.6.3 [13] using forecast [14] and ggplot2 [15] packages. For the accuracy of model
estimation, we trained the model on the incidence data from March 6, 2020, to June 28,
2020, and compared predicted values with the actual values for a period from June 29,
2020, to July 20, 2020, using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean
absolute scaled error (MASE) metrics.
Using the prevalence value, PPV was calculated as follows:

PPV =

sensitivity ∗ prevalence
(sensitivity ∗ prevalence) + (1 − specif icity) ∗ (1 − prevalence)

(3)

Similarly, NPV of the test was defined as:

NPV =

specif icity ∗ (1 − prevalence)
specif icity ∗ (1 − prevalence) + (1 − sensitivity) ∗ prevalence

Results
Forecasting the COVID-19 prevalence in Moscow
For choosing the forecast model, we separated the COVID-19 incidence data into
training and testing portions and then applied different EST and ARIMA models to the
training data. According to the MAPE and MASE values, ARIMA(0,2,1), ETS ZZZ
(automatically selected parameters), and ETS ANN (simple exponential smoothing with
additive errors) models provided the best fit for the testing dataset (Table 1).

Despite the good fit with the training data, ARIMA(0,2,1), ETS ZZZ, and ETS
ANN model predicted almost linear accumulation of COVID-19 cases. In contrast, the
actual data showed a gradual decrease in daily incidence (Figure 1). The only model
that followed the trend was ETS MMM (multiplicative trend, error, and season type),
and we used it to estimate the number of total COVID-19 cases in Moscow.
According to the ETS
MMM model, the COVID-19
incidence tended to 270,000
subjects. Note that the model
provides a very rough forecast
horizon; there might be
a second wave of the disease
and seasonal patterns that
we can not reliably predict
using the current data. The
Federal State Statistics Service
reported that, as of January 1,
2020, the Moscow population
was 12,678,079 [16]. From
these data, the COVID-19
prevalence in Moscow,
defined as the percentage with
the disease in the population
at risk, would be 2.1%.

Estimating the diagnostic accuracy of CT
47 OCTCs consulted 107,548 patients with a mean age of 42 ± 17 years, 60,539 females,
assessed for initial eligibility (Figure 2). 47,297 (48%) subjects showed no pneumonic
changes (CT0 category). We collected the data of second CT examinations performed 9

We used data on the dynamics of the disease to assess the diagnostic and prognostic
value of the “CT0-4” grading scale. For that, we considered the transition of a patient
from the categories CT0-CT2 (“home” group) to CT3 or CT4 (“hospital” group) as
deterioration of the condition (column “Worse” in Table 3). The reverse transitions,
from the “hospital” group to the “home” group, we regarded as an improvement in the
patient’s condition. Here we also included the cases in which the patient remained
within the “home” group, even when the disease progressed from CT0 to CT2 category
(column “Better” in Table 3). According to our calculations, the CT sensitivity was
27.7%, specificity 94.7%, PPV 10.1%, and NPV 98.4%.

Discussion
The objective of this work was to estimate whether the CT method and “CT0-4”
grading scheme, in particular, have diagnostic and prognostic value as a test for
COVID-19. Since RT-PCR tests, while being a “gold standard” for COVID-19 clinical
diagnosis, have several disadvantages [5–7], we developed an alternative approach to
assessing the characteristics of CT as a test for the disease. According to our results, the
grading scheme demonstrates low sensitivity and PPV, but high specificity and NPV.
The role and value of CT in COVID-19 diagnostics have sparkled debates in the
medical community [17, 18]. Chest CT has a low rate of missed COVID-19
diagnoses [19] and positively correlates with mortality in patients with COVID-19
pneumonia [20]. On the other hand, CT does not test for the specific virus, and
therefore its results could be misleading. Moreover, the experience and competence level
of a radiologist plays an essential role in the correct recognition of COVID-19—specific
CT patterns. Depending on the person interpreting the CT images, the specificity of
the test could be as low as 7% and as high as 100% (see Table S1).
When developing the “CT0-4” grading system and the method of its
implementation, we aimed to reduce the role and likelihood of human error in the
interpretation of CT images. For this, we have introduced reference templates to assist
the identification of both the presence and severity of the disease. Along with that, we
established the MRRC, one of the tasks of which was to validate the decisions of
radiologists at the OCTCs. Therefore, evaluating the diagnostic value of chest CT for
COVID-19, we evaluate the efficiency of this entire structure.
Since CT is unable to distinguish between viruses and RT-PCR has several flaws
that make it a sub-optimal reference standard, we monitored the clinical state for a
convenience sample of 973 patients to address the correctness of the diagnosis. Note
that the “CT0-4” grading scale allows a radiologist to simultaneously make a diagnosis
and a decision about the necessity of hospitalization, thus having predictive
functionality. Because of that, we focused on the issue of whether the CT0-4 category
provides a reliable prognosis for the disease progression in order to assess the diagnostic
value of the approach.
Our results show that the “CT0-4” grading system is highly specific and predictive
for identifying admissions of COVID-19 patients to hospitals. Out of 908 patients
initially assigned to the categories CT0-CT2, only 48 (5.3%) progressed to the CT3 and
CT4 categories, providing specificity 94.7% and NPV 98.4% for the approach. Of these
48 patients, only four (0.4%) deteriorated to the CT4 category (two each from the
initially assigned CT1 and CT2 categories). These numbers indicate the ability of the
test to optimize the burden on hospitals due to reliable and efficient triage decisions.
We associate the low sensitivity and PPV values of the test with the features of the
sample and the methodological setup. Due to the small number of patients in the
“hospital” group, even a slight change here can significantly affect the final value. For
example, just one additional case in the “Worse” column (see Table 2) would result in a
sensitivity value being 29.3% instead of 27.7%. Moreover, we considered a rapid
improvement of the patient’s condition as a marker of a false-positive test result,
although it could be a true-positive event. The median time to recovery for COVID-19
patients is estimated to be 20.8 days, but in individuals aged 50 –70+ years, it is longer
(22.6 days), further lengthening for those with severe symptoms (28.3 days) [21]. In our
study, the observation period was 9 ± 4 days, and subjects from the “hospital” group
were already at the advanced stages of the disease at the time of the initial CT
examination. The improvement in the patient’s condition during this period is
consistent with the time to recovery values and therefore, may be associated with an
effect of the therapy and not with the incorrect categorization of the individual. We
consider it as a limitation of the study and recommend to treat the reported CT

6/10

sensitivity and PPV values with caution and refer instead to the numbers in Table S1.
During the pandemic, one of the essential properties of a diagnostic test is the ability
to determine whether an asymptomatic subject has an undetected disease. For that, the
test must (i) be capable of detecting the disease in its preclinical stage; (ii) be
cost-effective; (iii) be widely available; (iv) be safe to administer, and (v) be able to
demonstrate improved health outcomes [22]. RT-PCR tests are safe and reasonable in
cost, but their performance strongly depends on the stage of the disease, providing a
non-constant false-negative rate [5].
Chest CT meets almost all the test requirements except safety. It is associated with
potential harm from exposure to ionizing radiation, which makes it inappropriate for
pregnant women and children. While CT is not widely available in general, some
locations have the necessary infrastructure. For example, the network of Moscow city
outpatient centers provided a sufficient amount of human and facility resources during
the disease outbreak. A number of studies reported high sensitivity of CT [6, 23–26].
According to our results, the “CT0-4” grading scale supported by the expert validation
is able to compensate for the moderate sensibility of chest CT, making it a highly
efficient tool for identifying admissions hospitals of COVID-19 patients.

Conclusions
“CT0-4” grading scale demonstrated high sensibility for COVID-19 and was associated
with the prognosis for the disease progression. These features make chest CT a rapid
and effective diagnostic test for the disease during the pandemic, which simultaneously
allows radiologists to make reliable triage decisions. The approach has its limitations
related to the safety and availability of CT and human error factor in CT images
interpretations. Substantial infrastructure capabilities, effective administrative decisions,
and competent human resources are required to make its implementation appropriate.
A network of OCTCs controlled by MRRC in combination with the “CT0-4” grading
scale proved to be an effective tool for routing and management of COVID-19 patients,
which was able to optimize the burden on hospitals.
