Abstract

phase transition, one of the general theory of physics.
This time, we have noted that the polymers, which
are complex systems of crystalline and amorphous
phases, resemble human society and that the time dependence of COVID-19 new infections resembles the
polarization reversal characteristics. The purpose of
this study is to see if the fundamental equation of the
model is directly applicable to the spread of COVID19 infection, although the epidemic is commonly analyzed by the SIR and its expanded models[6, 7, 8].

COVID-19 epidemics in Japan and Tokyo were analyzed by a fundamental equation of the dynamic
phase transition. As a result, the epidemic was found
to be in good agreement with the random nucleation
and linear growth model suggesting that the epidemic
between March 13, 2020 and May 22, 2020 was simply
rate-limited by the three constant-parameters: the
initial susceptible, domain growth rate, and nucleation decay constant. This model provides a good
predictor of the epidemic because it consists of one
equation and the initial specific plot is linear.

Data analysis
COVID-19 data of Japan

The COVID-19 data of Japan is provided in some
web sites. Using the data[11], and assuming the
one-dimensional growth, Fig. 1 shows the ln(1/(1 −
X))T ime2 characteristics of Japan. The red marker
is the detected infections, the black line is the theoretical curve of Eq.(7), and the orange line is Eq.(8).
The 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was obtained
by the moving standard deviation calculated over a
sliding window of 7 days across neighboring days.
The gray broken lines neighboring the theoretical line
represent the 95%CI. Appling the same 95%CI data
to Eq.(8), the slope of the orange line was estimated
to be 0.00170 ± 0.00002 as shown in the figure, which
gives the value of Sc GN0 ν/2 in Eq.(8).

Fig. 2 shows the number of daily new infections
and the total number of them versus time in Japan
in comparison with the one-dimensional theoretical
curves of Eqs.(10) and (9). The 95%CI was calculated
as same as that in Fig. 1 and shown by the broken
lines along the theoretical curves. The parameters
of the theoretical curves were adjusted to achieve a
close fit between the equation and the D(t) − t curve
by the least-square scheme using the slopes shown
in Fig. 1. The J(t) − t curve has larger relative
95%CI range, e.g. 509 ± 84(17%) at the maximum
J(t), than the D(t) − t curve, e.g. 5657 ± 92(1.6%) at
the maximum J(t) simply because J(t) is the number of daily announce of the PCR-tested-positive persons and D(t) is the sum of them. The obtained
values of the parameter were Ds = 15150 [person],
0.3780 − 0.0047 ≤ Sc GN0 ≤ 0.3780 + 0.0042 [1/day],
ν = 0.0090 [1/day], where D(t) was the value obtained by subtracting the sample value on March 26,
2020 as the baseline value and ν was assumed to be
constant.

Fig. 8 shows the number of daily new infections
and the total number of them versus time in Tokyo
in comparison with the two-dimensional theoretical
curves of Eqs.(15) and (14). The parameters of the
theoretical curves were obtained as mentioned above,
Ds = 5080 [person], 0.0155 − 0.0004 ≤ 2πG2 lc N0 ≤
0.0155 + 0.0004[1/day2 ], ν = 0.0072 [1/day], where
D(t) was the value obtained by subtracting the sample value on March 13, 2020 as the baseline value and
ν was assumed to be constant.
The one-dimensional model was a little inferior to
the two-dimensional one because the standard deviations of ln(1/(1 − X) were 0.119 and 0.081, respectively, although those of D(t) were 55 and 55, respectively.

The COVID-19 data of Tokyo is provided in some

one-dimensional growth, Fig. 5 shows the ln(1/(1 −

Fig. 6 shows the number of daily new infections

0.4200 + 0.0133 [1/day], ν = 0.0072 [1/day], where
D(t) was the value obtained by subtracting the sample value on March 25, 2020 as the baseline value and
ν was assumed to be constant.
Using the same data, and assuming the twodimensional growth, Fig. 7 shows the ln(1/(1 −

a new phase must be born and grow. In the case
of COVID-19, the nucleus is the first person who

ation changes randomly as the infected person moves.
If the nucleus is born at each place, it spreads in one
or two dimensions. This process fits the random nucleation and growth model. The characteristics have
been determined by three parameters: Ds , domain
growth rate Sc GN0 or 2πG2 lc N0 , and ν.
In Japan, there were approximately 16,000 presumed susceptible between March 13 and May 24,
2020. This is only about 0.13% of the total Japanese
population of 12,616,000. It corresponds to the limited domain growth area rather than the large number of immunes because the antibody positive rate
was announced on June 16, 2020 to be 0.10% in Tokyo
and 0.17% in Osaka[13] or 0.43%[14].
The value of the one-dimensional growth parameter Sc GN0 which is proportional to the growth speed
G, was a small constant of 0.378 [1/day] in Japan and
0.420 [1/day] in Tokyo. The inverse of these values,
2.7 and 2.4 days for Japan and Tokyo, respectively,
may be proportional to their serial intervals. The
value of ν was a small constant of 0.0090 [1/day] in
Japan and 0.0072 [1/day] in Tokyo. When the halflife t1/2 of the remained nuclei is calculated similar to
the radioisotope, for example, t1/2 = ln 2/0.0090 '
77 days, which is considered to relate to a period of
the epidemic.
In Japan, the contact chance with infected person and the range of random movement of the infected are estimated to be small since February 2020.
Many Japanese began to pay attention to COVID19 in February 2020. Experts have taken measures
against epidemic clusters since February 2020. It is
considered that such behavior became a factor that
restricted the nucleation and growth. There are views
that there may be other immunological factors, which
are expected to be verified scientifically.

linear growth basic model. The epidemic in Japan in
that period was simply rate-limited by three parameters that could be regarded as constant, the initial
susceptible, domain growth rate, and nucleation decay constant. This model provides a good predictor
of epidemic because it consists of one equation and
the initial ln(1/(1 − X)) specific plot is linear.
