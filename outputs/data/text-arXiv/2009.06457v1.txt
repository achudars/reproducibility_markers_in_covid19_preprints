Abstract
The last leg of the year 2019 gave rise to a virus named COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease
2019). Since the beginning of this infection in India, the government implemented several
policies and restrictions to curtail its spread among the population. As the time passed, these
restrictions were relaxed and people were advised to follow precautionary measures by
themselves. These timely decisions taken by the Indian government helped in decelerating the
spread of COVID-19 to a large extent. Despite these decisions, the pandemic continues to
spread and hence, there is an urgent need to plan and control the spread of this disease. This is
possible by finding the future predictions about the spread. Scientists across the globe are
working towards estimating the future growth of COVID-19. This paper proposes a Modified
SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) model for projecting COVID-19
infections in India and its five states having the highest number of total cases. In this model,
exposed compartment contains individuals which may be asymptomatic but infectious. Deep
Learning based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model has also been used in this paper to
perform short-term projections. The projections obtained from the proposed Modified SEIRD
model have also been compared with the projections made by LSTM for next 30 days. The
epidemiological data up to 15th August 2020 has been used for carrying out predictions in this
paper. These predictions will help in arranging adequate medical infrastructure and providing
proper preventive measures to handle the current pandemic. The effect of different lockdowns
imposed by the Indian government has also been used in modelling and analysis in the proposed
Modified SEIRD model. Moreover, this paper predicts the impact on the pandemic spread
when these restrictions are enforced further. These projections will act as a beacon for future
policy-making to control the COVID-19 spread in India.

1. Introduction
The world witnessed the COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) pandemic that affected the
lives of many people across the globe. The spread of this virus has taken an exponential speed.
Therefore, on 11th March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19
as a “global pandemic” [1]. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, an unavoidable situation was
created, whereby the authorities of various countries and continents had to put restrictions on
the movement of people and non-essential activities. Some of these restrictions included
imposing of lockdowns, maintaining social distancing, work from home in academics and in
business continuity plans. Thus, the spread of COVID-19 has left a major impact on the
environment as well as on the lifestyle of human beings [2], [3]. Almost all educational
1

institutions were closed, sports leagues were cancelled, and people were advised to work from
home, and perform contactless financial transactions using various digital platforms [4], [5].
COVID-19 was first reported in the Wuhan city of China on 17th November 2019 and from
there it has spread to the whole world [6], [7]. Due to the spread of this disease through human
to human contact, a large number of cases have been reported worldwide [8]. Recent studies
have found that a healthy person can be infected by coming in contact with an infected person
or with the surface touched by an infected person to which the Coronavirus got transferred.
Also, the symptoms of Coronavirus in an infected person are visible after a certain time period.
During this time period, the infected person is a carrier of Coronavirus and is able to infect
other healthy persons. As of 16th August 2020, more than 21 million people have been infected
and more than 0.7 million people have died from COVID-19 across the globe [9]. Therefore,
COVID-19 has become a big threat to people and environment [10], [11].
To tackle this difficult situation, the first step is to take precautionary measures to prevent the
infection and the second step is that infected people must quarantine themselves and get
medical help. Taking precautions on an individual level is also required, such as use of
sanitizer, use of face mask and maintaining social distancing. These resources namely
sanitizers and face masks are the need of time [12]. However, it is equally important to properly
dispose-off the used masks so as to protect the environment. Governments have also taken
many steps to arrange necessary resources to provide better medical services to the infected
people. An estimate of these resources is created so that all the needs of people can be met in
time. Different methods are being used by researchers to estimate the resources.
For a country like India, having a large population of around 1.38 billion, it is a challenging
task to handle this pandemic efficiently [13]. In India, the first COVID-19 positive case was
reported in the Thrissur district of Kerala on 30th January 2020, of a student who returned back
from Wuhan university, China. During the initial period, there wasn’t a substantial increase in
the number of cases in India and by 15th March, the number of cases barely crossed the figure
of 100. As of 16th August 2020, COVID-19 has spread to 215 countries with more than 6
million active infected cases globally. In India, the number of COVID-19 cases has crossed 2.5
million with more than 0.6 million active infected cases, 1.8 million recovered cases and 50,122
as the total number of deaths, which makes India the worst affected country in Asia. The
variation in the total number of infected cases is evident in India with highest reported cases
from Maharashtra and lowest from Mizoram [14].
The number of cases globally as well as in India is increasing at a very rapid rate. As is evident
from the data, state Maharashtra is the worst affected in terms of total cases which accounts for
about 23% of the cases in India. The next four worst affected states/ union territories are Tamil
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi having approximately 38% of the total cases and
the rest of Indian states/ union territories having another 39% cases. North eastern states of
India are much better like Mizoram, Sikkim and Meghalaya, each having less than 1500 cases
so far. To understand the future spread of pandemic and to devise management strategies,
various models have been designed, which give information regarding the time of attainment
of infection peak, the number of infected cases and the requirement of medical infrastructure
to manage the spread [15], [16].

2

In this paper, an epidemiological model named Modified SEIRD (Susceptible-ExposedInfected-Recovered-Deceased) model has been proposed. It utilises the real data of infections,
recoveries and deaths caused by COVID-19 to make predictions. We have used the data of
India and its five states having the highest number of total cases to make predictions using
Modified SEIRD model. Considering the data up to 15th August 2020, Maharashtra, Tamil
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Delhi are the five states with the highest number of
reported cases. The proposed model uses a parameter named epsilon for COVID-19
projections, which takes into account the proportion of Exposed population that is
asymptomatic but infectious, and is unknowingly spreading the infection. This paper predicts
the number of cases in Infected, Exposed, Recovered and Deceased compartments. Student ttest was used to obtain confidence levels for time-series data in consideration [17]. T-test is
useful when the sample size is very small as compared to large population size. Since the data
available is limited, t-test becomes an appropriate choice to find the confidence intervals for
COVID-19 predictions. The effect of different lockdowns imposed by the Indian government
has also been utilized in modelling using the proposed Modified SEIRD model.
Furthermore, this paper utilises Deep Learning (DL) based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
model to perform short-term projections for the next 30 days i.e. from 16th August 2020 to 14th
September 2020. The results obtained by LSTM model have been compared with the results of
the Modified SEIRD model. The epidemiological data up to 15th August 2020 has been used
to obtain projections in this paper. The upper and lower estimates of the predictions made by
both the models have also been calculated using 90% confidence intervals. The same has been
shown in the graphs corresponding to short-term predictions. It has not been shown for longterm predictions because the values are very close to the reported data and are not
distinguishable on the scale chosen for these graphs.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section presents the Review of Literature.
In Section 3, various models used for projections, namely, the proposed Modified SEIRD
model along with SEIR, SEIRD models and the LSTM have been explained. Section 4 presents
the Experimental Setup. The Results are discussed in Section 5, which is followed by
Conclusion at the end.

2. Review of Literature
COVID-19 is a communicable disease that has been declared as a pandemic by the WHO [18].
Moreover, there is no medicine or vaccine available to cure this infection as of now. Hence,
the only way to protect oneself from this pandemic is to get protected from the contact of any
infected person. With the ongoing pandemic threat, researchers started to study the future of
COVID-19. These research groups are mainly divided into two categories, where one tries to
find the vaccine and other group tries to predict the damage that can be caused by this disease.
Based on the predictions, resources can be prepared to treat people and minimize the fatalities.
This paper predicts the future trend of COVID-19 by modelling the effect of different
lockdowns imposed by the Indian government.
Since the beginning of COVID-19, various researchers have predicted its spreading trend for
different countries and their states [19], [20]. Ahmed [21] has studied the effect of patient age,
gender and their geographical location on the infection spread. In his work, the population of
3

India that has arrived from different regions is taken into consideration. These people were
divided into six groups to study the regional effect of Corona on a patient. Clustering and
Multiple Linear Regression are two techniques that have been used for this study. Clustering
has been used to find the similarity between different groups. Multiple Linear Regression has
been used to predict the source of infection by assigning the new patient case into one of the
above defined groups. In every group, different age distributions have been studied and their
recovery rates were calculated.
Ceylan [22] utilised Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to predict
the future trend of the Coronavirus disease in the three worst affected countries of Europe,
namely Italy, Spain and France. The author formulated several ARIMA models using different
parameter values. The best models were then used for estimating the spread of the disease in
each of the three countries. Patrikar et al [23] have used the modified SEIR method in their
work to predict the curve of COVID-19 for India. In this modified SEIR, the effect of social
distancing has been studied on the COVID-19 and different graphs have been obtained. It was
also concluded that social distancing is working in India, according to the model given by
Poonia et al [24]. In the paper, authors performed short term forecast of COVID-19 for
different states of India in worst case scenario.
SEIR model was also used to study the effect of temperature on COVID-19 outbreak in China
[25]. In the paper, the authors incorporated climatic factors in the original SEIR model to
analyse their impact on the spread of COVID-19. Due to the dynamic nature of the Coronavirus
spread, many researchers have performed short-term forecasting of the future spread of this
deadly virus. Roosa et al [26] performed 5-day and 10-day forecasts of the total confirmed
cases for Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces of China. The authors used logistic growth model,
Richards growth model and a sub-epidemic wave model to generate predictions. A bootstrap
approach was adopted in the paper to compute the uncertainty bounds for predicting cumulative
cases in near future.
Arora et al [27] made use of different variations of Long Short-Term Memory models for shortterm prediction of COVID-19 cases in India. Deep LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)
and Convolutional LSTM (Conv-LSTM) were used to calculate one-week predictions for
different states and union territories of India. Tomar et al [28] also used LSTM along with
power-law curve fitting to predict the trend of COVID-19 in India. The authors forecasted the
total number of confirmed, recovered and deceased cases for a short time span of next 30 days.
In addition, the paper also analysed the effect of different values of transmission rate on the
number of predicted infected cases.
Pal et al [29] combined the COVID-19 data with the weather statistics of different countries to
predict active cases using shallow LSTM model. The authors used Bayesian optimization
together with fuzzy rules to predict the future risk of Coronavirus in their work. Pandey et al
[30] analysed the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in India and forecasted the trend for two weeks
in future. The authors used the SEIR model to predict the future trend of the virus in India, with
and without interventions. Additionally, Regression model was also used by the authors to
predict the change in the number of confirmed and death cases in India.

4

Chakraborty et al [16] proposed a hybrid approach to generate ten-day predictions for United
Kingdom, France, India, Canada and South Korea. The model combined Wavelet model and
ARIMA models for computing predictions for next ten days. Various studies have been
recently conducted by the researchers to understand the dynamics of this pandemic for different
regions across the globe [3], [1], [31], [32], [33], [34]. The forecast of COVID-19 in Indian
context also has been investigated by many researchers using mathematical and
epidemiological models, but limited contribution exists for its states [35], [19], [36], [37], [38],
[23].
In this paper, a compartmental epidemiological model, named Modified SEIRD (SusceptibleExposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) model has been proposed for the projection of
COVID-19 spread in India and its five states with the highest number of total cases. Further,
short-term predictions for next 30 days have also been computed using the LSTM model and
the results are compared with the projections of the proposed Modified SEIRD model. The
forecasts are as good as the quality of data available and, therefore, the future spread of the
virus may also affect the predictions. The next section presents the proposed Modified SEIRD
model and the LSTM model used for projections.

3. Models used for Projections
This section describes the proposed Modified SEIRD model based on SEIR and SEIRD
epidemiology models, and the Long Short-Term Memory Model (LSTM) model, that have
been used in this paper for projecting the trend of COVID-19 in India and its five states having
the highest number of total cases.

3.1. Proposed Modified SEIRD model
The proposed SEIRD model for COVID-19 is based on SEIR and SEIRD epidemiology models
which are first described below.

SEIR and SEIRD Models
To model the trend of a disease, researchers have used various epidemiology models in the past
[35], [38], [39]. One of the most common models used in the literature is SEIR (SusceptibleExposed-Infectious-Recovered) model [34] [40]. It is a mathematical data modelling technique
based on SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model, which is used for forecasting the
spread of an epidemic [41], [42]. The SEIR model is diagrammatically represented in Figure
1.

Figure 1: SEIR Model

In SEIR model, the population is divided into four compartments namely S, E, I, and R [43],
[44]. Each of these compartments can take different values with respect to time, representing
their dynamic behaviour. These have been described as follows:
5

 S(t) - The number of individuals who are susceptible to the disease, i.e. who are not (yet)
infected on day t.
 E(t) - The number of individuals who have been in contact with the infected people and are
exposed to the disease on day t, but disease symptoms are not yet visible in them. Such
individuals are called asymptomatic.
 I(t) - The number of infected individuals on day t, assumed to be infectious and are able to
transmit the infection to others.
 R(t) - The number of individuals who were infected, but they have recovered on day t and
developed immunity. This also includes the people who have died [45], [33], [46]. Some
authors name this compartment as Removed compartment.
The assumptions related to the SEIR model are listed below:
 There is no entry or departure from the population except possibly through death from the
disease [35].
 Recovered people become immune to the disease, and can no longer spread the infection.
 The increase in the number of infected people is directly proportional to the number of
infected people as well as to the size of the exposed population.
 Number of recovered persons is directly affected by the number of persons being infected.
In SEIR model, shown in Figure 1, the transmission rate β, regulates the flow of spread which
describes the possibility of spreading infection within a susceptible and infectious individual.
It represents the average contact frequency. 𝛼 represents the onset rate where 1/𝛼 is average
latent period. Infected individuals leave the infected compartment at a rate 𝛾𝐼 to join the
recovered class, 1/𝛾 being the average infectious period.
The spread of a disease may lead to many casualties. However, this category of people is not
included in SEIR model separately. Therefore, to represent this group of people separately, a
new compartment ‘D’ is added to the existing SEIR model and the resulting model is known
as SEIRD model [47], [48]. SEIRD model has been depicted in Figure 2. Here, D(t) denotes
the number of deceased individuals on day t. Infected people become Deceased with a rate 𝜇𝐼.

Figure 2: SEIRD Model

As the COVID-19 is a pandemic and SEIRD model works well for such situations, so this paper
uses the SEIRD model and proposes SEIRD model with infectivity in exposed population to
make predictions. The proposed Modified SEIRD model has been described in the next subsection.

6

Proposed Modified SEIRD model
SEIRD model assumes that exposed population is non-infectious, whereas it has been seen in
COVID-19 cases that asymptomatic individuals are tested positive and are also responsible for
spreading the disease. Hence, we have modified the SEIRD model to include infectivity in
exposed population. The SEIRD model has been modified with the introduction of parameter
‘ε’ (epsilon), which accounts for the part of Exposed population that is asymptomatic, but
infectious, and hence infecting others [35]. The proposed model is named as Modified SEIRD
model and is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Modified SEIRD Model

The Modified SEIRD model is governed by the following differential equations:


The susceptible equation:

The exposed equation:

(5)

Here, N = S + E + I + R + D, is the total population. Each person belongs to one of the five
compartments namely Suscepted, Exposed, Infected, Recovered and Deceased. A person can
shift from one compartment to other. The parameters used in equations (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5)
regulate the shift of people among different compartments. These parameters are discussed
below:


Beta (β): This parameter represents the transmission rate per capita. It denotes the number
of persons which come in contact with an infected person per day.
Epsilon (ɛ): This parameter denotes the proportion of exposed people which are infectious
and unknowingly infecting other susceptible people.
Alpha (α): It represents the onset rate where 1/α is average latent period.
Gamma (γ): It represents the recovery rate where 1/γ is mean infectious period.
Mu (μ): This parameter denotes the rate at which infected people become deceased.

To study the growth of infection, researchers have used the basic reproduction number, Ʀ0, and
effective reproduction number, Ʀe, as evaluation metrics in their work [49]. Basic reproduction
7

number Ʀ0 is defined as the average number of secondary infections generated when one
infected person is introduced into a host population where everybody is susceptible. Ʀ0 is
calculated by equation (6):
β

β

Ʀ0 = ((γ+μ)) + ɛ ∗ (α)

(6)

Effective Reproduction number, Ʀe, is the average number of new infections generated by an
infectious individual on day t, in the partially susceptible population S. It is calculated by
equation (7):
Ʀe=Ʀ0*

S

(7)

N
β

Equations (6), (7) clearly show the increase by a factor ɛ ∗ (α) in the value of Ʀ0 and the
corresponding increase in Ʀe by the exposed infectious population. Hence the parameter ɛ,
representing the proportion of infectious exposed population contributes to the growth of
COVID-19. High value of this parameter indicates that there are more infectious exposed
persons and contact tracing should be done, so that these persons can be isolated to reduce the
spread of the disease.

3.2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model
Deep Learning (DL) is a branch of Machine Learning which is inspired by the working of the
human brain. Some of the popular DL techniques are Deep Neural Network (DNN),
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) etc. RNNs are an
extension of DNNs that consist of feedback links along with feed-forward connections [50].
Unlike a DNN, RNNs use the previous output to compute the next output. So, they can
efficiently process natural language, recognize speech, and perform image captioning as
compared to other DL techniques [51].
RNN suffers from the problem of vanishing and exploding gradient [52]. To solve these
problems, LSTM networks are used. LSTM is an extension of RNN which allows the network
to learn long-term dependencies in the input data. It processes and forecasts time-series data
very efficiently. Each LSTM cell comprises of three gates: Input Gate, Forget Gate, and Output
Gate. Figure 4 depicts these three gates present in each LSTM cell.

Figure 4: LSTM cell

The equations (8), (9), (10), (11), (12) and (13) are used in LSTM cell. 𝑊𝑖 , 𝑊𝐶 , 𝑊𝑓 , 𝑊𝑜 and
𝑏𝑖 , 𝑏𝐶 , 𝑏𝑓 , 𝑏𝑜 are the weights and biases, respectively.
it = σ(Wi ⋅ [ut−1 , xt ] + bi )

(8)

C̃t = tanh(WC ⋅ [ut−1 , xt ] + bC )

(9)

ft = σ(Wf ⋅ [ut−1 , xt ] + bf )

(10)

ot = σ(Wo ⋅ [ut−1 , xt ] + bo )

(11)

Ct = ft Ct−1 + it C̃t

(12)

ut = tanh Ct × ot

(13)

In each LSTM cell, tanh activation function is used, which distributes the gradients computed
in the backpropagation algorithm while training the LSTM network [51]. Hence, it solves the
vanishing and exploding gradient problem of RNN.
As the data of COVID-19 is a time-series data and LSTM models time-series data very well,
so we have used LSTM network to model the COVID-19 data of India and its five states having
the highest number of total cases.

4. Experimental Setup
In this paper, the experimentation was performed in Python using Jupyter Notebook and
PyCharm Integrated Development Environment. COVID-19 data was collected for India as
well as its five states having highest number of total cases. The epidemiological data till 15th
August 2020, was taken from the covid19india.org website [14]. For India, the data for
Confirmed, Recovered and Deceased cases is available since 30th January 2020. For states, the
data is available 14th March 2020 onwards. In case of India, data is available for Daily
Confirmed, Total Confirmed, Daily Recovered, Total Recovered, Daily Deceased and Total
Deceased cases. So, no pre-processing was required for the data of India. However, in case of
states, only Daily Confirmed, Daily Deceased and Daily Recovered cases were available. So,
pre-processing was performed on this data to obtain Total Confirmed, Total Deceased and
Total Recovered cases for all states. These have been calculated by taking the cumulative sum
of Daily Confirmed cases, Daily Deceased cases and Daily Recovered cases respectively.
For experimentation, two different models based on epidemiological and DL have been used
to make projections. In this paper, the proposed Modified SEIRD, an epidemiological model
and LSTM, a deep learning-based model, have been used. Further, t-test has been used to
compute the lower and upper estimates of 90% confidence interval for the predictions and are
shown in Figure 11 (a-f) -16 (a-f) for short-term predictions. The experimental setup for both
of these models have been described in the upcoming sub-sections.

4.1. Experimental Setup for the proposed Modified SEIRD model
For experimentation, proposed Modified SEIRD model uses various parameters mentioned in
Section 3 above. The values of these parameters, β, ε, α, γ and μ, have been estimated in this
paper through curve fitting to actual data, performed using different functions of Python’s lmfit
library. The optimized values of these parameters have been obtained by the minimize function.
This function uses dual annealing method for obtaining a global optimal solution. The initial
value of infected, I0, is taken as 1 based on the assumption that the infection started from one
person. The initial value of exposed, E0, recovered, R0, and deceased, D0, are initialised to 0.
The value of S0 is calculated by equation (14):
S0 = N-E0-I0-R0-D0

(14)

A study of variation in different parameters of the proposed Modified SEIRD model due to the
Lockdowns imposed by the Indian government has also been included in the paper. By using
the data of a Lockdown period, the value of β and other parameters have been calculated. There
are four Lockdown and three Unlock periods in India till date. Hence, the data is divided in
eight time periods: Before Lockdown [30th January – 24th March], Lockdown 1.0 [25th March –
14th April], Lockdown 2.0 [15th April – 3rd May], Lockdown 3.0 [4th May – 17th May], Lockdown
4.0 [18th May – 31st May], Unlock 1.0 [1st June – 30th June], Unlock 2.0 [1st July – 31st July]
and Unlock 3.0 [1st August onwards].
To obtain the optimal values of the parameters, the proposed Modified SEIRD model takes
initial value, lower bound and upper bound as input for each parameter. For India, the initial
value of β was taken as 0.5 with bounds [0.001, 1]. The parameter ε was initialised to 0.1 with
bounds [0.0001, 1]. For α, the initial value was 1/5 and its bounds were [1/6, 1]. For parameter
γ, the initial value was 0.1 with [1/14, 1] as bounds. For parameter μ, 0.001 was the initial
value and [0.001, 1] were the selected bounds. For the five states, the same initial values and
bounds have been taken except for the lower bound of beta which was taken as 0.01. The
optimal parameter values for curve fitting obtained for a particular Lockdown/Unlock period,
are used for obtaining the projections in the next Lockdown/Unlock period.
The next sub-section describes the experimental setup required by the LSTM model for
projecting the COVID-19 trend.

4.2. Experimental Setup for LSTM model
The six different time-series of Daily Confirmed, Daily Recovered, Daily Deceased, Total
Confirmed, Total Recovered, and Total Deceased for India and its states obtained after preprocessing have been used for creating one LSTM for each of these series. These models have
been created using the keras API. Since LSTM is very sensitive to range of data provided to it
as input, therefore, pre-processing was required to normalize the input data to [0,1].
Normalization was done by using equation (15) through the MinMaxScaler function of sklearn
library.

xnorm =

x−xminimum
xmaximum−xminimum

(15)

10

After normalization, the input data was split into 80-20 ratio as training and testing dataset
respectively. Further, these datasets were divided into feature set and the output value set. The
dimensionality of feature set and output value set depends on the hyper-parameter,
number_of_previous_days. Its value signifies the number of previous days’ output used to
predict the output for the current day. Length of training set is taken as 𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and value of
number_of_previous_days as 𝑝. The dimensionality of feature set and output value set is taken
as (𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 − 𝑝 × 𝑝) and (𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 − 𝑝 × 1) respectively.
The LSTM models designed for Confirmed and Recovered time-series, have four different
LSTM layers and each layer has 100 LSTM cells. On the other hand, the LSTM model designed
for Deceased time-series also has four LSTM layers with 150 LSTM cells per layer. After
LSTM layers, one fully connected layer was added with 100 neurons in Confirmed and
Recovered model and 150 neurons in Deceased model with linear activation function. After
this, a fully connected layer was added with one neuron as output layer and linear activation
function.
The LSTM model uses the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss with batch
size 16 and 100 epochs in this paper. To avoid overfitting of the model, Dropout and Early
Stopping was taken into account. In this paper, the probability of Dropout is taken as 0.4 and
the patience value for Early Stopping as 5, i.e. if the testing loss has not improved in
consecutive 5 epochs then the training will stop.
Finally, these models were fine-tuned against the hyper-parameter, number_of_previous_days,
for the data of India and its five states having the highest number of total cases. The value of
this hyper-parameter ranges between 1 and 90. The value of number_of_previous_days was
selected with minimum testing loss. The optimal values of this hyper-parameter for India and
its five states having the highest number of total cases, has been tabulated in Table 1.

The results obtained by both the proposed Modified SEIRD model and LSTM model are
presented in the next section.

5. Results
This section discusses the results obtained by both the proposed Modified SEIRD model and
LSTM models respectively. The proposed Modified SEIRD model performs both long-term
and short-term projections, whereas, LSTM performs only short-term projections. Further, the

11

90% confidence intervals have been calculated using t-test. The corresponding results are
discussed in detail in the following sub-sections.

5.1. Results obtained for Long-term predictions using the proposed Modified
SEIRD model
India is a geographically diverse nation, consisting of 36 states and union territories. Owing to
India’s large population and high population density, the Indian government implemented
various nationwide lockdowns to curb the spread of Coronavirus. Though the COVID-19
pandemic did not leave any state/ union territory unaffected, some states have been far more
affected by this deadly disease, as compared to others. As on August 15, 2020, the top five
Indian states with the highest number of Total Confirmed cases are: Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu,
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi. The curve for Daily Confirmed cases for India have
been shown in Figure 5 (a), while Figure 5 (b) presents the curves for Exposed, Active Infected,
Recovered, Deceased and Total Confirmed cases for India. Table 2 shows the parameter values
obtained for India by the proposed Modified SEIRD model.

Figure 5 (b): Forecasting Results for India

The results obtained for India witness a peak of COVID-19 cases for India on 3rd November
2021 with 8,57,390 daily cases, and the disease may die out towards the end of year 2023.
These results are based on the current situation; however, these may vary depending on various
decisions taken by the Indian government and the precaution measures taken by people from
time to time. It can be seen from Table 2 that the value of β, that represents the infection
transmission rate per capita, increased during Lockdown 1.0. This resonates with the decision
of the Central government to extend the lockdown. The effect of Lockdowns was also observed
on ɛ, whose value reduced as lockdowns were extended and people became aware about the
importance of precautionary measures. But during Unlock 1.0, the value of ɛ increased, thus
causing a rise in the number of exposed people. It was observed that both the parameters ɛ and
μ decreased over time, except during Unlock1.0 when many relaxations were given by the
government, more people were exposed and the value of ɛ suddenly increased. The increase
in the value of α signifies a reduction in the average latent period and an increased γ depicts a
reduction in the time to recover 1/γ, resulting in increase in recovery rate among the Indian
population. There has also been a reduction in the value of reproduction number for India, and
it has reduced from Ʀ0 = 3.028 to Re = 1.163 as on 15th August 2020. This indicates that there
has been a reduction in the number of secondary infections produced by an infected person.
This positive change in parameter values can be attributed to the restrictions imposed by the
Indian authorities. Next, Table 3 presents the parameter values obtained for the Maharashtra
state, while its forecasting results have been shown in Figure 6 (a) and Figure 6 (b).

Figure 6 (a): Predicted Daily Confirmed cases for Maharashtra

Figure 6 (b): Forecasting Results for Maharashtra

The state of Maharashtra has witnessed the highest number of Coronavirus cases since the
advent of the pandemic in India. The main reason behind this can be Maharashtra’s high
population density and the presence of Asia’s largest slum named Dharavi. Due to this,
Maharashtra had a very high Ʀ0 in the initial days of the pandemic. However, by mid-August
2020, Ʀe has reduced below 1.2 as computed by the proposed model. The proposed Modified
SEIRD model indicates that on 5th July 2021, Maharashtra will record 81,935 Daily Confirmed
cases which would be the highest for this state. The number of Total Confirmed cases would
have crossed 16 million by that time, out of which 14 million would have recovered from this
disease. For Maharashtra, the death rate μ has always remained higher than most of the other
Indian states, and the recovery rate γ has been lower than the national average. Due to the
severity of the infection, the Maharashtra government decided to extend the duration of
restrictions imposed on its residents. However, several relaxations were offered during Unlock
3.0 and the impact of this has been captured by the β parameter of the proposed model. Its value
14

sees a decreasing trend till Unlock 2.0, but an increase in this value can be seen during Unlock
3.0. Surprisingly, a downfall in the proportion of Exposed population is observed at the same
time. However, under the prevailing circumstances, the proposed model predicts more than 0.8
million COVID-19 deaths in the state by the end of year 2022. Table 4 shows the parameter
values obtained for Tamil Nadu, while its forecasting results for Tamil Nadu have been shown
in Figure 7 (a) and Figure 7 (b).

As of 15th August 2020, Tamil Nadu had the second highest number of COVID-19 cases in
India and has crossed 0.3 million Total Confirmed cases. The values of Ʀ0 and Ʀe for this state
were found to be 7.86 and 1.02 (as on 15th August 2020) respectively, as calculated by the
proposed model. Out of these, almost 80% people have recovered and 1.5% people have
succumbed to this deadly disease. This southern state of India witnessed a sharp spike in the
number of COVID-19 cases since June 2020 and based on the forecasting results of the
proposed Modified SEIRD model, Tamil Nadu will have the highest Daily Confirmed cases
on 5th February 2021 with a count of 7,681. By the end of year 2022, it is projected that 6% of
the state’s current population would have been infected from the virus and around 0.1% people
would lose their battle against this pandemic. As shown in Table 4, the parameter values
computed from the model, indicate a hike in the recovery rate (γ) as well as the death rate (μ)
in the state. Next, Table 5 presents the parametric values obtained by the proposed model for
Andhra Pradesh, while Figure 8 (a) and Figure 8 (b) represent its forecasting results.

Figure 8 (b): Forecasting Results for Andhra Pradesh

For Andhra Pradesh, it can be seen that the per capita transmission rate of the disease,
represented by β, significantly increased during the fourth Lockdown and the first Unlock
period. However, at the time of writing of this paper Andhra Pradesh is the only state that has
surpassed its COVID-19 peak. The state observed its peak on the first day of August 2020 with
the maximum recorded Daily Confirmed cases of 11,122. It can also be verified from Figure 8
(a). There is a significant difference in the shape of the curve obtained for Andhra Pradesh and
Tamil Nadu. The main reason behind this is that both these states saw a steep rise in the number
of COVID-19 cases around the second half of the year 2020. This scenario can also be seen by
observing the trend of their parameter values. The infection curve for Andhra Pradesh has
started seeing a downward trend, which is also reflected by the increasing value of the recovery
rate. Also, the value of reproduction number for Andhra Pradesh has gone below the value 1,
which clearly indicates that the decline of this deadly disease in the state. Next, Table 6 presents
the parameter values for the state of Karnataka, while Figure 9 (a) and Figure 9 (b) present the
forecasting results for the same.

Figure 9 (a): Predicted Daily Confirmed cases for Karnataka

Figure 9 (b): Forecasting Results for Karnataka

The results obtained for Karnataka show that there will be a peak of COVID-19 cases on 7th
April 2021 with 1,24,722 Daily infections, and the disease will die out towards the end of year
2022. The values of Ʀ0 and Ʀe for Karnataka were found to be 9.93 and 1.31 (as on 15th August
2020) respectively, as calculated by the proposed model. An interesting trend was observed in
the values of β and ε. When one of these parameters decreases, the other increases and viceversa. Overall, β has reduced over time, which depicts a reduction in the transmission rate per
capita in this state. It was seen that during the first two Unlocks, ε also reduced. However,
Unlock 3.0 witnessed a surge in its value, thereby indicating an increase in the number of
exposed individuals as more relaxations were offered to the public. On an average, it was found
that γ, the recovery rate has increased in the state, leading to a higher number of recovered
individuals. It can be seen from the results that the value of μ, that denotes the rate of deceased
population, has decreased over time. Table 7 shows the parameter values for Delhi and its
forecasting results have been shown in Figure 10 (a) and Figure 10 (b).

Figure 10 (a): Predicted Daily Confirmed cases for Delhi

Figure 10 (b): Forecasting Results for Delhi

Delhi is the national capital of India which has always remained in the top five states till 15th
August, and has been severely affected by COVID-19. However, Delhi’s rank has drastically
changed over the recent months and it has now shifted down from the second spot to the fifth
spot. The value of reproduction number for Delhi has also come down from 3.21 to 1.06 as of
19

15th August 2020. Despite this fact, the projections for Delhi indicate that the current scenario
is just a local-minima and its infection curve will reach its peak on 15th June 2021 with 6249
Daily Confirmed cases. At the time of peak, the number of Daily Infected cases is expected to
rise to 6249, with more than 51k Active Infected people of Delhi. According to the proposed
Modified SEIRD model, Delhi will have more than 2 million Total cases by the end of 2022,
out of which 98% people would have recovered. This attributes to the high recovery rate of this
union territory. However, the sharp decrease in the number of cases in Delhi, has also brought
the authorities under a scanner. Multiple news channels have questioned the authenticity of the
quality of the tests being conducted for COVID-19 patients.

5.2. Results obtained for Short-term prediction using the proposed Modified
SEIRD model and LSTM model
This section discusses the short-term projections performed using the proposed Modified
SEIRD model as well as the LSTM model for India and its five worst-affected states for next
30 days, i.e., from 16th August 2020 till 14th September 2020. The predictions for six timeseries namely, Daily Confirmed, Daily Recovered, Daily Deceased, Total Confirmed, Total
Recovered and Total Deceased, have been obtained from both the models. Case Fatality Rate,
Recovery Rate and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) have also been calculated to
analyse the results. These have been mathematically defined in equation (16), (17) and (18)
respectively.

It can be observed from Table 8 that the values of Recovery Rate calculated by both the models
are very close to the Actual Recovery Rate values on 15th August 2020. Similarly, the Case
Fatality Rates computed by both the models for India and its five states in consideration, almost
resemble the Actual Case Fatality Rates. Moreover, the Recovery Rates and Case Fatality Rates
achieved by the proposed model closely correspond the values obtained by LSTM as well. This
clearly indicates that the proposed Modified SEIRD model can accurately forecast the trend of
COVID-19 in India and its states by modelling all the important parameters correctly.
The short-term projections performed by the proposed Modified SEIRD model show that by
14th September 2020, the Recovery Rate for India may increase by more than 1% and the Case
Fatality Rate may decrease by less than 0.5%. For the state of Maharashtra, the proposed model
shows an improvement of around 9% in the Recovery Rate and a drop of about 0.5% in the
Case Fatality Rate. Surprisingly, LSTM shows a drastic reduction in the value of Recovery
Rate for this state. A similar pattern can be observed for Tamil Nadu, for which the proposed
model predicts a positive change in the Recovery Rate, but the LSTM model predicts a
reduction in this value. However, both the models agree on a gradual decline in the value of
Case Fatality Rate for Tamil Nadu.
For the remaining three states, the proposed Modified SEIRD model and the LSTM have
similar projections for the Recovery Rate of COVID-19 disease in upcoming 30 days.
Regardless, a contrasting trend in the values of Case Fatality Rates can be observed for Andhra
Pradesh and Karnataka, where one model predicts a hike but the other indicates a decline in
the value. Figure 11 (a-f) present the projections made by both the models for Daily Confirmed
cases in India and its five worst affected states. The lower and upper estimates corresponding
to 90% confidence interval (CI) has also been shown in the graphs for the predictions made by
both the models.
Based on the projections of the proposed Modified SEIRD model, by mid-September, the
number of Daily Confirmed in India, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu will be 74733; 16906 and
6947 respectively. For Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi, this number is expected to be
8240; 11357 and 1787 respectively. Similarly, by using the LSTM model the estimated number
of Daily Confirmed cases are 82190; 14750; 6266; 11311; 10274 and 1067 for India,
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi.

As is evident from Figure 11, that the predictions made by both the models were found to be
significantly similar to each other. This claim is also verified by the values of Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) for both the models. For the proposed Modified SEIRD model, these
values were 0.05, 0.11, 0.11, 0.15, 0.33 and 0.29 for India and its five states respectively. In
case of LSTM model, MAPE values were 0.18, 0.09, 0.18, 0.28 and 0.28 for India,
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi respectively. Figure 12 (a-f)

The graphs in Figure 12 show a rising trend in the number of Daily Recovered cases. According
to the proposed Modified SEIRD model, there will 66119; 14703; 6766; 8263; 8762 and 1665
Daily Recovered cases in India, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and
Delhi by 14th September 2020 respectively. However, based on the forecasting performed by
the LSTM model, India and its five states will have 82891; 8547; 6624; 11805; 11371 and 913
Daily Recovered cases. The proposed model was able to perform accurate predictions for this
Daily Recovered time series data. The MAPE values obtained from the proposed model were
0.06, 0.25, 0.21, 0.36, 0.30 and 0.59 for India, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh,

To lessen the impact of any pandemic, it is important to control the number of deceased
patients. The trend of Daily Deceased individuals for next 30 days can be observed in Figure
13 (a-f). The proposed Modified SEIRD model and the LSTM model predict 881 and 1254
Daily Deceased for India on 14th September 2020. For the five Indian states in consideration,
this value will remain below five hundred, with 400, 112, 86, 194 and 14 Daily Death cases
estimated by the proposed model; and 423, 112, 121, 144 and 12 Daily Deceased cases as per
the LSTM model. Using the Daily Deceased cases, the proposed Modified SEIRD model was
able to obtain extremely accurate predictions. The MAPE values corresponding to both the
models, was found to be below 0.60 for India and its five states in consideration. Figure 14 (a24

respectively. For Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi, this number is expected to be 532542;
481769 and 201145 respectively. Similarly, by using the LSTM model the estimated number
of Total Confirmed cases are 4200226; 612359; 425972; 333376; 248125 and 155748 for India,
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi. For the same time-series, the
MAPE values for the proposed model were found to be 0.02, 0.01, 0.02, 0.08, 0.1 and 0.01
corresponding to India and its five states respectively. For the LSTM model, the corresponding
MAPE values were 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.09, 0.04 and 0.03. These low error values indicate the
effectiveness of the proposed Modified SEIRD model in performing projections. Figure 15 (af) present the projections made by both the models for Total Recovered cases in India and its

3585678; 803056; 475286; 441233; 334757 and 182244 Total Recovered cases in India,
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi by 14th September 2020
respectively. However, based on the predictions obtained from the LSTM model, India and its
five states will have 2595423; 318204; 324921; 335020; 210364 and 140954 Total Recovered
cases. Based on the above values, the MAPE for India was found to be 0.07 and 0.01 for the
proposed Modified SEIRD model and LSTM model respectively. For Maharashtra, Tamil
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Delhi, the proposed model achieved MAPE of 0.01,
0.05, 0.2, 0.05 and 0.1 respectively; whereas the LSTM model had MAPE values of 0.08, 0.01,
0.18, 0.09 and 0.18 respectively. Figure 16 (a-f) present the projections made by both the

models for Total Deceased cases in India and its five worst affected states along with their
confidence intervals obtained through t-test.

Figure 16 (a-f): Actual and Predicted Total Deceased cases for India and its five worst-affected states

The proposed Modified SEIRD model and the LSTM model predict 76724 and 68132 Total
Deceased for India on 14th September 2020. For the five Indian states in consideration, this
count will be 30163; 8858; 5639; 8811 and 4927 Total Death cases estimated by the proposed
model; and 8517; 7003; 3487; 5687 and 4228 Total Deceased cases as per the LSTM model.
For this time series data, it was found that the projections of the proposed model were highly
synced with the projections made by LSTM. This can be verified from the fact that for India,
the proposed model and LSTM achieved low MAPE values of 0.11 and 0.03 respectively.
Furthermore, the MAPE values for the proposed Modified SEIRD model was found to be
below 0.8 for all the five states in consideration.

6. Conclusion
With the exponential growth in the number of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases
worldwide, countries need to prepare themselves with appropriate measures to tackle this
epidemic. This can be achieved through proper projections that can help the governments to
take decisions accordingly and create more infrastructure, if required. This projection is
particularly important for a country like India which ranks second in population size with high
population density in several states. In this paper, a Modified SEIRD (Susceptible-ExposedInfected-Recovered-Deceased) model was proposed to perform COVID-19 projections for
India and its five states having the highest number of total cases. This model also considers
asymptomatic infectious patients for the projections. Further, Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) model was also used in this paper to perform short-term projections. To predict the
trend of the pandemic, data up to 15th August 2020 was utilised for experimentation purposes.
The results obtained by the proposed Modified SEIRD model and LSTM model were compared
for next 30 days. Lower and upper estimates of 90% confidence intervals for the predictions
were computed using Student t-test. The effect of different lockdowns imposed in India, was
also analysed and modelled using the proposed model.
