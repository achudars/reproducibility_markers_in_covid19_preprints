Abstract
Accurate forecasting of medical service requirements is an important big data problem that is crucial for
resource management in critical times such as natural disasters and pandemics. With the global spread of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), several concerns have been raised regarding the ability of medical
systems to handle sudden changes in the daily routines of healthcare providers. One significant problem
is the management of ambulance dispatch and control during a pandemic. To help address this problem,
we first analyze ambulance dispatch data records from April 2014 to August 2020 for Nagoya City, Japan.
Significant changes were observed in the data during the pandemic, including the state of emergency (SoE)
declared across Japan. In this study, we propose a deep learning framework based on recurrent neural
networks to estimate the number of emergency ambulance dispatches (EADs) during a SoE. The fusion
of data includes environmental factors, the localization data of mobile phone users, and the past history
of EADs, thereby providing a general framework for knowledge discovery and better resource management.
The results indicate that the proposed blend of training data can be used efficiently in a real-world estimation
of EAD requirements during periods of high uncertainties such as pandemics.

rate diagnosis and treatment. To prevent virus infection at hospitals, an early pandemic protocol was considered [6]. Emergency service management should
be included in this protocol. Later on, a guidance
for health worker infection prevesion was relased by
World Health Organization (WHO) [7]. Paramedics
have also suffered from the spread of this novel virus;
thus, a more careful management than usual is required [8–10].
In Japan, the first state of emergency (SoE) was
declared nationwide on April 16, 2020, and was revoked on May 25, 2020. Note that, during this pandemic, a complete closure policy was not adopted in
Japan, but rather a voluntary segregation and seclusion with community cooperation was applied. During the SoE, outdoor activities were reduced, particularly in common crowded regions such as major train
stations. From April 18, 2020, NTT Docomo, Inc. (a
mobile phone operator in Japan) started to provide
publicly available data on activities based on the user
locations of mobile phones or smartphones in major
traffic stations nationwide.
The careful management of healthcare infrastructure is required for fair allocation and usage especially
where these resources are limited [11]. Owing to a
lack of data on ambulance services in such a pandemic
era, it was unclear how many allocations were needed
for ambulances, including the number of emergency
ambulance dispatches (EADs) and special requirements for additional processes, such as disinfection
after the transport of potentially positive cases. The
open questions here are i) how accurate EAD forecasts can be when applying environmental factors,
ii) how the changes caused by abnormalities such as
a SoE during a pandemic should be handled, and iii)
what are the main reasons for such changes, including the relationship with human activities? If such
information is made available, additional measures
for ambulance management can be implemented. For
example, it will be possible to strictly limit the use
of certain ambulance units for potential COVID-19
patients.
This study first analyzed EAD data recorded from
April 1, 2014, to August 18, 2020, in Nagoya City,
Japan. This analysis has led to a high-quality estimation of the number of EADs based on data gath-

ered before the COVID-19 era using machine learning approaches. A comparison of the estimated and
actual EADs observed during the pandemic clarifies
the differences caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. A
data analysis model can provide better understanding of the potential approaches used to estimate the
number of EADs during a pandemic and calls during
a SoE. The main factor for this was also discussed
for potential future pandemics, including third waves
of COVID-19. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that applies a deep learning approach to forecast the daily number of EADs
when considering environmental factors, even during
non-pandemic states. The main contributions of this
study can be summarized as follows:
• A machine learning architecture for accurate
EAD forecasting in urban areas from environmental factors
• A trained long short-term memory (LSTM) network for EAD estimation in Nagoya City, Japan,
with a potential extension to other regions based
on data availability
2

• The introduction of a new social factor (i.e., mobile phone usage) that can be used to fine-tune
the EAD forecasting during a pandemic

shown in Fig. 3. A common U-shape curve can be
observed at both the maximum and minimum temperatures, whereas the relative humidity triggers a
slightly higher number of EADs within the middle
range. However, the effect of environmental factors
can be split into different patterns based on the cause
or illness corresponding to the EADs.
In addition, weekends and holidays are other factors that characterize human social activities. Furthermore, the age of the population affects such activities. The typical retirement age in Japan is currently approximately 60-65 years. In addition, an age
of over 65 is classified as elderly; thus, 65 years is used
as a reference value in this study. The former factors
were used as input for applying machine learning to
the data on the previous 5 years. The statistics are
applied for the populations younger and older than
65 years in age. The learning-based estimation is applied as a reference value for 2020 and then compared
with the observed value determined by the city fire
department.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study area and data source
Nagoya is a major city in Japan located in the central region of Honshu Island (Fig. 1) with a population varied from 2,272k to 2,316k (2014–2020), which
makes Nagoya the fourth largest city nationwide1 .
All daily EAD data were collected by authorities at
the Fire Department of the City. Fig. 2 illustrates
the daily total number of EADs from April 2014 to
August 2020. The total number of EADs can be
thought of as a U-shaped plot with two annual peaks
during the summer and winter, which is highly associated with upper and/or lower temperature peaks.
Weather data, including maximum and/or minimum
daily temperature and other related factors such as
humidity, were collected for Nagoya City from the online resources of the Japan Meteorological Agency2 .
We also processed data representing the variations
(in percentage) of people around the major transport stations in Japan collected by the mobile career NTT Docomo, Inc. and released on the web3,4 .
These data were made available immediately after the
emergency declaration on April 18, 2020. Note that
the national market share of NTT Docomo is approximately 36.9% (ranked first)5 . The data are based on
the estimated statistical population generated from
mobile terminal network operational data [12].

2.3. Effects of the Covid-19 pandemic
Unexpected pandemics are known to cause extensive requirements for medical care services and special resource management [20]. From the data presented in Fig. 4, clearly, the number of EADs in 2020
is lower than that during the past 5 years. Figure 5
shows the number of EADs according to the maximum daily ambient temperature. Data were divided
into categories based on the pickup site (i.e., indoor or
outdoor). The normal pattern observed since April
2014 significantly changed during the pandemic, as
smaller numbers of dispatches were observed in both
location categories. A further reduction was also recognized during and after the first SoE (up to August
19). One potential reason for the reduction in EADs
during the pandemic is the change in social activities. However, there are several other factors such
as the enhanced hygiene [21] and avoiding the access
to medical facilities to prevent potential COVID-19
infection [22]. It is difficult to explicitly highlight the
main reason but it is likely a composition of many factors include the above mentioned ones. Even using
models that enable artificial intelligence (or machine

2.2. Correlation with environmental factors
It is well known that the number of ambulance dispatches is related to the daily average ambient temperature [13–19]. The effects of the daily maximum
and minimum ambient temperatures, as well as the
relative humidity, on the number of daily EADs are

learning), specific data patterns are challenging to estimate using models trained on data measured under
normal situations.
2.4. Recurrent Neural Network
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a wide
range of network architectures that consider interneuronal connections such that they formulate a
memory-like unit [23]. LSTM is a commonly used
class of RNN that performs well with long-term dependencies (Fig. 6). To address this problem, we consider an LSTM-based network architecture. Consider
a time-series data sample X = (x(1) , x(2) , . . . , x(T ) )> ,
(t)
(t)
(t)
(t)
where x(t) = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xI ) and xi is the measurement of the ith variable at the tth time slot frame.
The computation within a single LSTM node can be
expressed as follows:
(1)

o(t) = σ(Wox x(t) + Wos s(t−1) + bo ),

(2)

φ(c(t) ),

(5)
(6)

where i(t) , o(t) , f (t) , m(t) , and s(t) represent the input gate, output gate, forget gate, memory gate, and
node state values at time frame t (here, day index),
respectively. W and b are the node weights (parameters) and bias matrices. σ and φ are the sigmoid and
tanh functions, respectively. LSTM layers are trained
using time-series data to optimize the parameters for
future forecasting tasks.
The proposed architecture consists of two LSTM
layers (with 50 and 30 nodes) and a three fully connected (FC) layers (with 300, 100 and K nodes). The
input data vector contains the daily based maximum
ambient temperature, average relative humidity, and
a binary label that identifies working days from nonworking days (weekends or national holidays). The
network output is a K nodes representing the number
future days to be predicted. The network parameters
(W) and bias (b) are initialized with zero matrices.
In addition, the Adam algorithm [24] is used for data
fitting during training along with the cross-entropy
loss function and automatically estimated learning
rate. The network architecture was implemented using Wolfram Mathematica ® ver. 12.1 on a workstation with four Intel ® Xeon CPUs running at 3.60
GHz, with 128 GB of memory and three NIVIDIA
GeForce 1080 GPUs.

3. Results
We investigated two scenarios that consider the
pre- and ongoing pandemic periods.
The prepandemic results are used to validate the feasibility
of the LSTM architecture in estimating the number
of daily EADs when considering the different categories and conditions. We further analyzed the effect
of the Covid-19 pandemic and demonstrated a finetuning used to effectively handle bias factors resulting from such abnormalities. The forecast accuracy is

3.1. Daily EAD forecast during normal times (prepandemic)

is found as the number of EADs is significantly decreased in 2020 (Fig. 8). To overcome this problem,
the data on the mobile users’ location are included
as an additional input term. The available data provided by NTT around Nagoya’s main station (April
18 to August 18, 2020) are shown in Fig. 9 along with
profile of COVID-19 positive cases in Japan6 . We assume that the mobile phone usage is 100% during
January 2020 where other missing data were linearly
interpolated. Figure 8 shows the forecast results with
and without mobile data for different data groups.
We observed a significant improvement in the estimation accuracy. Table 2 presents the descriptive
statistics and assessment metrics. These data clearly
demonstrate that mobile data usage as a surrogate of
social activities is useful in improving the forecasting
of EADs in different data groups. To clearly demonstrate the forecast accuracy, a plot representing the
estimated number of daily EADs in association with
the daily maximum temperature and average relative humidity is shown in Fig. 10. Estimated data
are demonstrated with almost the same pattern in
both cases; however, including the mobile users’ location data significantly reduces the error caused by
the abnormalities.

We consider data from April 1, 2014, to December 31, 2018, for training and 2019 data for testing.
The output is split into different categories considering the pickup location (indoor/outdoor) and age
categories: children (0 ≤ age ≤ 15), adult (15 < age
≤ 65), and elderly (age > 65). Training is considered through 500 epochs with a batch size of 8 samples. The results are presented in Fig. 7, and the
descriptive statistics and quality metrics are listed
in Table 1. It can be observed that elderly patients
are estimated to have the highest accuracy compared
with the other age categories. This may reflect the
high sensitivity of elderly citizens to changes in environmental factors. In addition, the indoor patients
can be estimated with a higher accuracy compared
with outdoor patients because outdoor EADs include
many cases that are unrelated to weather data such
as road accidents.
3.2. Daily EAD forecast during the pandemic
Under this scenario, we consider the data from
April 1, 2014, to December 31, 2019, as the training set and the data from January 1 to August 19,
2020, for testing. The network is trained similarly to
the first scenario setup; however, a significant error

3.3. Contribution of different variables
To validate how different variables contribute to
the estimation of daily EADs, we conducted an ablation study. The experimental data presented in Fig. 8
is repeated with exclusion of single variable each. We
consider exclusion of mobile usage data, maximum
temperature, average humidity and day label (working day/off day). The network is retrained with these
different set of variables and data of 2020 is estimated
for each case. Results are shown in Fig. 11 along
with box plots demonstrate MAE in each case. These
results demonstrate that training using all variables
leads to MAE of 4.70% and mobility data that represent a surrogate of social activities during the pandemic is the most dominant variable that increase
the MAE to 19.12% when excluded. Excluding temperature, humidity and day label are of comparable
importance and lead to increase MAE to values of
8.44%, 7.66% and 8.04%, respectively.

In some cases, it is required to have a long-term
forecasting that demonstrate data beyond just a single day. The network architecture is designed to express estimation of K successive days. The training
session is repeated with different architectures with
K = 3, 7, 14 and 28 with all other parameters fixed
as those shown in Fig. 8 and the number of EADs
for 2020 is estimated once more. Figure 12 demonstrate results obtained from different value of K. The
future K days are computed for each day from the
beginning of 2020. Therefore, each day is presented
with different values (1 to K). We demonstrate the
average, minimum and maximum estimated daily values. It is clear from these data, that a good estimation can be achieved within small time period (e.g.
3 days), however, estimation error accumulates when
the estimation period extended further. This is clear
from the regions labeled with the dashed line ellipse
in Fig. 12. MAE associated with K = 3, 7, 14 and 28
is 7.32%, 7.79%, 8.02% and 8.46%, respectively.
4. Discussion

were evaluated for the planning of the third wave
of COIVD-19 and future pandemics. As one notable
feature in Japan, the government did not lock down
the city, but requested people to apply voluntary constraints. Nagoya is a primal city in the third largest
area, following the Kanto (Tokyo) and Kansai (Osaka) areas, in Japan. In addition, ambulance use
is free in Japan; thus, the number of EADs corresponds approximately to the real number of patients
who need such transport.
The number of patients transported by ambulance
during the state of the emergency was generally
smaller than that during previous years. This difference may be attributable to the significant reduction
in the activities of adults; the percentage of teleworking in Japan is normally approximately 1%, whereas
it was 30% in April 2020. As a discrepancy in the activities of the population, teleworking became common around the city center but not in the suburbs.
Patients younger than 65 years in age should be
well correlated with the activities of the population
in the city center. Similarly, a reduction was observed
even in the elderly. We then demonstrated that environmental factors such as the maximum temperature
and relative humidity can be used to estimate the
number of people transported by ambulance. During a pandemic, special care (e.g., disinfection) is required even for emergency services. During this particular pandemic, ambulances were disinfected when
transporting potential COVID-19 patients, at least
in Nagoya. Thus, resource management was critical
during the pandemic, and maintaining the number of
dispatches below a certain level has been essential.
During the pandemic, the number of patients transported was reduced by 20% at maximum, whereas
the amount of human activity around the central station was suppressed by 80%. The findings here will
be useful to estimate or plan ambulance allocations.
The second SoE in Japan was declared active from
January 7 up to March 7, 2021 (tentative schedule).
The average daily mobility reduction rate in the first
and second SoEs7 and the normal period in between
at Nagoya main station was 63%, 29.1% and 18.8%,

In this study, the numbers of people transported
by ambulance and based on population activities

respectively. This indicates the positive response of
public (in different scales) during emergency calls to
voluntarily reduce the social activities.
As a limitation of this study, the EAD data were
not classified into specific diseases, some of which
may be highly related to environmental factors (such
as heat stroke or respiratory system failure), whereas
others may not be related at the same level. However,
splitting the data and applying a further generalization of the proposed model to handle this problem
may remain as a future study. Moreover, a comparison with data obtained from different cities would
provide a better understanding of the outlined framework.

estimating the number of EADs with environmental factors using the LSTM architecture. Moreover,
a strong bias was recognized when forecasting the
number of EADs required during the COVID-19 pandemic. To handle this problem, additional data indicating a reduction in mobile phone usage in major
crowded areas, such as train stations, were used as a
surrogate for the reduction of social activity during
the pandemic. Including these data can significantly
reduce the forecasting error during a time of uncertainty, such as during unexpected pandemics.

5. Conclusion
This study investigated the correlation between environmental factors such as ambient temperature, absolute humidity, and the daily number of EADs in
Nagoya City, Japan. Data collected from April 2014
indicate a good correlation that may be potentially
useful in future forecasting of required AED facilities
based on weather data. A machine learning framework based on an LSTM network architecture was
used for time-sampled forecasting, and interesting results were shown within a normal state. This finding
presents for the first time an affordable method for
