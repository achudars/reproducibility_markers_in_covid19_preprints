Abstract
The recent coronavirus pandemic follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion, with
the number of cases as a function of time reasonably well fit by N (t) ∝ eαt , in many countries. We
analyze the rate α in different countries, choosing as a starting point in each country a threshold
of 30 total cases and fitting for the following 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth
in a rather homogeneous way. We look for a link between the rate α and the average temperature
T of each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. We analyze a base set of 42 countries,
which developed the epidemic at an earlier stage, an intermediate set of 88 countries and an extended
set of 125 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently. Fitting with a linear behavior
α(T ), we find increasing evidence in the three datasets for a decreasing growth rate as a function
of T , at 99.66%C.L., 99.86%C.L. and 99.99995% C.L. (p-value 5 · 10−7 , or 5σ detection) in the
base, intermediate and extended dataset, respectively. The doubling time is expected to increase by
40% ∼ 50%, going from 5◦ C to 25◦ C. In the base set, going beyond a linear model, a peak at
about (7.7 ± 3.6)◦ C seems to be present in the data, but such evidence disappears for the larger
datasets. Moreover we have analyzed the possible existence of a bias: poor countries, typically
located in warm regions, might have less intense testing. By excluding countries below a given GDP
per capita from the dataset, we find that this affects our conclusions only slightly and only for the
extended dataset. The significance always remains high, with a p-value of about 10−3 − 10−4 or less.
Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly
decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation
should be hopefully stopped by strong lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of
the next cold season.

INTRODUCTION

The recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is having a major effect in many countries, which
needs to be faced with the highest degree of scrutiny. An important piece of information is whether
the growth rate of the confirmed cases among the population could decrease with increasing temperature. Experimental research on related viruses found indeed a decrease at high temperature
and humidity [1]. We try to address this question using available epidemiological data. A similar
analysis for the data from January 20 to February 4, 2020, among 403 different Chinese cities, was
performed in [2] and similar studies were recently performed in [3–7]. The paper is organized as
follows. In section II we explain our methods, in section III we show the results of our analysis and
in section IV we draw our conclusions.

II.

METHOD

We start our analysis from the empirical observation that the data for the coronavirus disease
in many different countries follow a common pattern: once the number of confirmed cases reaches
order 10 there is a very rapid subsequent growth, which is well fit by an exponential behavior. The
latter is typically a good approximation for the following couple of weeks and, after this stage of free
propagation, the exponential growth typically gradually slows down, probably due to other effects,

such as: lockdown policies from governments, a higher degree of awareness in the population or the
tracking and isolation of the positive cases.
Our aim is to see whether the temperature of the environment has an effect, and for this purpose
we choose to analyze the first stage of free propagation in a selected sample of countries. We choose
our sample using the following rules:
• we start analyzing data from the first day in which the number of cases in a given country
reaches a reference number Ni , which we choose to be Ni = 30 [8];
• we include only countries with at least 12 days of data, after this starting point.
The data were collected from [9]. We then fit the data for each country with a simple exponential
curve N (t) = N0 eαt , with √
2 parameters, N0 and α; here t is in units of days. In the fit we used
Poissonian errors, given by N , on the daily counting of cases. We associated then to each country
an average temperature T , for the relevant weeks, which we took from [10]. More precisely: if for a
given country the average T is tabulated only for its capital city, we directly used such a value. If,
instead, more cities are present for a given country, we used an average of the temperatures of the
main cities, weighted by their population [11]. For most countries we used the average temperature
for the month of March, with a few exceptions [12].
We analyzed three datasets. A first list of countries was selected on March 26th. The list of such
base dataset includes 42 countries: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China,
Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia,
Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, U.S.A..
An additional set of countries was added to the first dataset on April 1st, reaching a total of 88
countries. The added countries, in this intermediate set, are: Albania, Andorra, Algeria, Armenia,
Austria, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Hungary, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Moldova, Morocco, New Zealand,
North Macedonia, Oman, Panama, Pakistan, Peru, Qatar, Russia, Senegal, Serbia, Slovakia, South
Africa, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, Vietnam.
Finally an extended set has been studied on April 14th [13], adding the following countries to the
previous dataset: Belarus, Bolivia, Cameroon, Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic
of Congo, Djibouti, El Salvador, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Honduras, Jamaica, Kenya,
Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritius, Montenegro, Niger, Nigeria, Paraguay, Puerto
Rico, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago , Uganda, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Zambia.
Using such datasets for α and T for each country, we fit with two functions α(T ), as explained in
the next section. Note that the statistical errors on the α parameters, considering Poissonian errors
on the daily counting of cases, are typically much smaller than the spread of the values of α among
the various countries. This is due to systematic effects, which are dominant, as we will discuss later
on. For this reason we disregarded statistical errors on α. The analysis was done using the software
Mathematica, from Wolfram Research, Inc..

RESULTS

We first fit the base dataset, with a simple linear function α(T ) = α0 + β T , to look for an overall
decreasing behavior. Results for the best fit, together with our data points, are shown in fig. 1. The
estimate, standard deviation, confidence intervals for the parameters, together with the significance
and the explained variance, R2 , are shown in Table I. From such results a clear decreasing trend is
visible, and indeed the slope β is negative, at 99.66% C.L. (p-value 0.0034).
However, the linear fit is able to explain only a small part of the variance of the data, with
2
R2 = 0.196, and its adjusted value Radjusted
= 0.175, clearly due to the presence of many more
factors.
In addition, a decreasing trend is also visible in this dataset, below about 10◦ C. For this reason
we also fit with a quadratic function α(T ) = α0 − β(T − TM )2 . Results for the quadratic best

fit are presented in fig. 2 and in Table II. From such results a peak is visible at around TM ≈
8◦ C. The quadratic model is able to explain a slightly larger part of the variance of the data,
since R2 ≈ 0.27 [14]. Moreover, despite the presence of an extra parameter, one may quantify
the improvement of the fit, using for instance the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model
comparison, ∆AIC ≡ 2∆k − 2∆ ln(L), where ∆k is the increase in the number of parameters,
compared to the simple linear model, and ∆ ln(L) is the change in the maximum log-likelihood
between the two models. This gives ∆AIC = −2.1, slightly in favor of the quadratic model.
We repeated then the same analysis for the intermediate dataset of 88 countries and for the
extended dataset of 125 countries. Results for the linear fit of the intermediate sample are shown

For the extended sample results of the linear fit are shown in fig. 4 and in Table IV. The slope
β becomes larger and, most importantly, the significance highly increases, since a zero slope is now
excluded at 99.99995% C.L. (p-value 5·10−7 , or 5σ detection, translated in the language of a Gaussian

distribution). Now R2 = 0.19 and Radjusted
= 0.18.
In this dataset, which extends to April 14th, a few anomalies are however present: in the case of
Bangladesh and Thailand it is possible to see that the exponential growth became much faster after
the initial 12 days. We have checked what happens by using a different interval of time for these 2
cases, instead of the standard 12 days. Namely we have used 44 days for Thailand and 21 days for
Bangladesh, which give the maximal value of α in both cases. The results for the linear fits using
such corrected values is shown in Table V. The significance is lower, but still very high: p-value
4.6 · 10−6 , or 4.6σ detection, translated in the language of a Gaussian distribution.
Finally we have tested the existence of a possible bias on the data: the fact that poor countries

have less intense testing. This could in principle be a source of major bias, since many countries
with low income are located in warm regions. In order to discard such a bias we have analyzed
the existence of a nonzero linear correlation β on subsamples of the extended dataset, by excluding
countries with low income. More specifically we have set a threshold on the GDP per capita [15],
and checked whether the correlation is still there, excluding countries below such a threshold from
the analysis. We show in Fig. 5 our results: we find a correlation to exist, rather independently on
the threshold that we applied. The significance of a nonzero beta (p-value) is plotted in Fig. 6 and
remains always between 5 · 10−7 and 8 · 10−4 .
In addition, we have also checked for a correlation between the growth rate α and the GDP
per capita, shortly GDP . We find no significant correlation in the base and intermediate datasets,
while we find a negative correlation in the extended dataset, with p-value = 0.0012. This is not so
surprising, since the extended dataset contains many low-income countries, where the disease has
arrived later, and where most likely testing is not intense enough. For this dataset we performed
thus a linear fit with two variables, GDP and T . Results are shown in Table VI. The dependence
on T is still highly significant, with p-value ' 0.000048 and the best-estimate is β ' −0.0031. As
expected, T also has non-negligible correlation with the GDP per capita.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have collected data for countries that had at least 12 days of data after a starting point, which
we fixed to be at the threshold of 30 confirmed cases. We considered three datates: a base dataset
with 42 countries, collected on March 26th, an intermediate dataset with a total of 88 countries,
collected on April 1st, and an extended dataset with a total of 125 countries, collected on April
14th. We have fit the data for each country with an exponential and extracted the exponents α,
for each country. Then we have analyzed such exponents as a function of the temperature T , using
the average temperature for the month of March (or slightly earlier in some cases), for each of the
selected countries.
For the base dataset we have shown that the growth rate of the transmission of the COVID-19
has a decreasing trend, as a function of T , at 99.66% C.L. (p-value 0.0034). In this fit R2 = 0.196.
In addition, using a quadratic fit, we have shown that a peak of maximal transmission seems to be
present in this dataset at around (7.7 ± 3.6)◦ C. Such findings are in good agreement with a similar
study, performed for Chinese cities [2], which also finds the existence of an analogous peak and an
overall decreasing trend. Other similar recent studies [3–6] find results which seem to be also in
qualitative agreement.
For the intermediate dataset we also found a decreasing slope β. This is smaller in absolute value,
but the significance remains high, since a zero slope is excluded at 99.86% C.L. (p-value 0.0014). For
this fit we found R2 = 0.11.
Finally for the extended dataset we found a very highly significance for a negative β, p-value
5 · 10−6 ∼ 5 · 10−7 (depending on the treatment of some anomalous cases), which would translate in
a 4.5σ ∼ 5σ detection, in the language of Gaussian distributions. Here R2 = 0.16 ∼ 0.2.
For all datasets we also tested the influence of a possible large bias: the fact that poorer countries
have less intense testing, which might be in principle partially degenerate with effects of temperature.
Our analysis indicate that this should not be a major issue: by excluding countries with low income
from the analysis we find small variations on the best-fit value of β, and the significance of the
correlation β remains very high, with p-value 8 · 10−4 or less. We have also checked for a correlation
between the GDP per capita and α: we find a significant correlation only in the extended dataset.
This should be probably interpreted as the fact that poorer countries do not have enough testing
capabilities. However, after taking into account of this variable, the dependence on T remains highly
significant.
The decrease at high temperatures is expected, since the same happens also for other coronaviruses [1]. It is unclear instead how to interpret the decrease at low temperature (less than 8◦ C),
present in the base dataset. This could be a statistical fluctuation, since it is not present in the
intermediate and extended datasets. One possible reason for this decrease, if real, could be the lower
degree of interaction among people in countries with very low temperatures, which could slow down
the propagation of the virus.
A general observation is also that a large scatter in the residual data is present, clearly due to
many other systematic factors, such as variations in the methods and resources used for collecting
data and variations in the amount of social interactions, due to cultural reasons. Further study is
required to assess the existence and the relevance of such factors.
As a final remark, our findings can be very useful for policy makers, since they support the
expectation that with growing temperatures the coronavirus crisis should become milder in the
coming few months, for countries in the Northern Hemisphere. As an example the estimated doubling
time, with the quadratic fit, at the peak temperature of 7.7◦ C is of 2.6 days, while at 26◦ C is expected
to go to about 4.6 days. The linear fit implies an increase in the doubling time by 50% (or 40%), going
from 5◦ C to 25◦ C., using the estimate from the extended dataset (or the extended dataset, taking
into account of the GDP per capita, at a reference value of 40 thousand dollars). For countries with
seasonal variations in the Southern Hemisphere, instead, this should give motivation to implement
strong lockdown policies before the arrival of the cold season.
We stress that, in general, it is important to fully stop the propagation, using strong lockdown,
testing and tracking policies, taking also advantage of the warmer season, and before the arrival of
the next cold season.
