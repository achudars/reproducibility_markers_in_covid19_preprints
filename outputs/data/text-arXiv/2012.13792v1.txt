Abstract
We analytically study the SEIR (Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed)
epidemic model. The aim is to provide simple analytical expressions for the
peak and asymptotic values and their characteristic times of the populations
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Keywords: COVID-19; SEIR; nonlinear dynamics
1. Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak has motivated a large number of numerical
studies using epidemiology models [1, 2]. A commonly used model is the
Susceptible—Exposed—Infected—Removed (SEIR) model [3]. This model
is formulated as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, for
which no exact analytic solution has yet been found. For this reason, most
of the recent works focus on the numerical analysis of statistical ensembles of
initial data for these equations. However, due to the uncertainty and often
unreliability of the clinical data, the prediction about the real evolution of
the epidemic is rather difficult, if not impossible [4, 5]. On the other hand,
the SEIR epidemic model provides a deterministic evolution for some given

initial state. Therefore, the aim of this work is to provide simple expressions
of the main characteristics of the population of individuals that have been
in contact with the disease, as of instance the peak of the infected population and the time after which it occurs, the final number of individuals
who have contracted the disease and the temporal shape of the infectious
population’s curves. These analytical expressions can become useful through
their application to the COVID-19, to obtain fundamental parameters as the
reproduction number r and the epidemic starting time.
The paper is organized as follow, In sec. II we recall the SEIR model;
in sec. III we study the linear regime with the exponential growing and
decaying evolution, depending on the reproduction number r; in sec. IV we
investigate the nonlinear regime in the free spread evolution with r > 1. We
approximate the exact model of equations by a reduced model where the
decaying mode is adiabatically eliminated. This reduced model allows to
obtain analytical results which have been seen to be in good agreement with
the exact numerical solution. Sec. V summarizes the results and draws the
conclusions.
2. The SEIR model
We used the susceptible—exposed—infected—removed (SEIR) compartment model [3, 6, 7, 8] to characterize the early spreading of COVID-19,
where each individual could be in one of the following states: susceptible
(S), exposed (E, being infected but without infectiousness), infected (I, with
infectiousness), recovered (R) and dead (D). At later times a susceptible individual in the state S would turn to be an individual in the exposed state
2

E with a rate r/τI , where r is the reproduction number (i.e. the average
number of infected people generated by each infected person during the desease) and τI = 1/γ2 is the average time in the infected state I. An exposed
individual in the state E becomes infected, i.e. in the state I in an average
time τE = 1/γ1 . Then the infected individual is removed from the total population with the rate γ2 either by recovering (R) or dying (D) with a mean
case fatality proportion p. The dynamical process of SEIR is described by
the following set of equations:

(3)

Ṙ = (1 − p)γ2 I,

(4)

Ḋ = pγ2 I.

(5)

Here S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) and D(t) respectively represent the number of
individuals in the susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered and death states
at time t and N is the total number of individuals in the system such that
N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t). Finally, the cumulative population C is
C = E + I + R + D,

(6)

equal to the total population of individuals who have contracted the infection.
3. Linear regime
If E(t), I(t), R(t)  N (t), then the susceptible population S can be approximated by the total population N (i.e. S ∼ N ) and the equations for
3

the exposed and infected population are linear:
Ė = rγ2 I − γ1 E

3.2. Analysis
The only parameter which can be controlled by confinement measures is
the reproduction number r. In the following we assume that for COVID19 the characteristic times are τE = 3.69 days and τI = 3.48 days [9]. We
consider the time evolution of the population E and I for r > 1, r = 1
and r < 1, corresponding to the explosive, marginally stable and relaxation
regimes, respectively.

with r > 1, then subsequently changed to r = 1 and later on to a value r < 1.

at t = 20 (marginally stable regime) and the blue solid line is for r = 3 until
t = 20, then r = 1 between t = 20 and t = 30 and finally r = 0.8 for t > 30
(relaxation regime). Notice the asymmetry of the curve of I(t) due to the
different growing and decaying rates.

4. Nonlinear regime
In the following, we investigate the nonlinear regime with a constant reproduction number r > 1. This corresponds to a free spread of the infection,
with an initial exponential growth of the exposed population E, and so also
of I and D. The exponential growth stops when susceptible population S becomes sensibly less then the total number N of the individuals. This regime is
similar to the saturation in a single-mode laser, where steady-state is reached
when the gain of emitted photons equals the losses by the cavity [10]. Notice
that
E + I + S + R + D = N0

(23)

is a constant of motion and N (t) = N0 − D(t). However, if p  1 we always
have D  N0 , so that with a good approximation we can approximate N
by N0 . Introducing the removed population Q = R + D, we can eliminate
S = N0 − (E + I + Q) using the constant of motion and obtain

Ė = rγ2 1 −
I − γ1 E
N0
I˙ = γ1 E − γ2 I
Q̇ = γ2 I

(24)
(25)
(26)

We normalize the variables by N0 defining x = E/N0 , y = I/N0 and z =
C/N0 where C = E+I+Q is the cumulative population, i.e. the total number
of individuals who have contracted the infection. Then the equations become
ẋ = rγ2 (1 − z)y − γ1 x

(27)

ẏ = γ1 x − γ2 y

(28)

ż = rγ2 (1 − z)y

(29)

8

These equations have a single steady-state solution (i.e. ẋ = ẏ = ż = 0)
with x = y = 0 (end of the epidemics) and z = z0 with 0 < z0 < 1. This
solution is stable if r0 = r(1 − z0 ) < 1. We see that the stability condition
implies
z0 > 1 −

(30)

In Fig. 2 we plot E/N , I/N and C/N for r = 1.5, p = 0.01, τE = 3.69 days,
τI = 3.48 days and initial conditions E(0) = 10, I(0) = 0, N (0) = 6 · 107 .
We observe that C/N tends to a steady-state value of about 0.6, whereas the
peak of I/N is about 0.03: it means that for these parameters the 60% of
the total population has contracted the infection and the peak the infected
population is about 3% of the total population. Note that these results are
independent on p and depend only on τE , τI and r.
4.1. Reduced model
In this section we find an approximated analytic solution of Eqs. (27)(29) in the free spread evolution with r > 1. The idea is to adiabatically
eliminate the decaying mode with negative eigenvalue λ− . To this aim, it is
convenient to write Eqs.(27)-(29) in the basis of the eigenvalues λ± . Writing

(53)

The same transcendental equation (53) for z∞ has been obtained for the SIR
compartmental model [12, 13]. Here we have demonstrated its validity also
for the SEIR model.
We see from Fig. 3 that s = 0 for z = 0 and z = z∞ . The maximum

5. Results and Conclusions
We have obtained analytical expressions for the asymptotic value of the
cumulative population fraction C/N and the peak of the infectious population fraction I/N in the case of free spread evolution of COVID-19. Furthermore, we have obtained approximated expressions of these quantities
as a function of time and the times at which the peak and the end of the
epidemics is expected. We summarize here below these results:
(a) The asymptotic value of the cumulative population fraction is C∞ /N =
z∞ , where z∞ is the solution of the transcendental equation (53). A
comparison between the exact solution obtained by integrating Eqs.(1)(5) and the solution of Eq.(53) is shown in Fig.4(a). Notice that this
value depends only on the reproduction number r.
(b) The peak value of the infectious population fraction is, from Eqs.(45),(48)
and (54),

expression we have obtained the expression of I(t)/N as a function of

These analytic expressions can be useful for deriving the uncertainty in the
estimates of COVID-19 caused by the fluctuations of the values of the control
parameters, as for instance the reproduction number r. In fact, the results
of ref.[4] suggest that uncertainties in both parameters and initial conditions
rapidly propagate in the model and can result in different outcomes of the
epidemics. For instance, Fig.4a and 4b show the dependence of the fraction of
the final cumulative fraction, C∞ /N , and the daily infections peak, Ipeak /N ,
as a function of r. We observe that the sensitivity of C∞ /N on r variations
is larger when r is close to unity (with approximately C∞ /N ≈ 2(r − 1))
whereas it decreases for increasing values of r. On the other hand, Ipeak /N
grows almost linearly with r (approximately as Ipeak /N ≈ 0.07(r − 1)), so
that its sensitivity to r variations is almost constant. Finally, the uncertainty

of the peak time tpeak (see fig.5) on r variations is very large for r close to
unity and it reduces strongly at larger r.
In conclusions, we have obtained analytical expressions for the peak and
asymptotic values of COVID-19 pandemic curves in the free spread as a
function of the reproduction number and the two average times in the exposed
and infected states. The results have been obtained by reducing the exact
nonlinear model by adiabatically eliminating the decaying mode of the linear
regime. This allows to reduce the SEIR model of a set of two equations
similar to the Lotka-Volterra equations, from which exact and approximated
solutions can be obtained. The analytical results have been compared with
the exact numerical solution, showing good agreement. Particular interesting
is the asymptotic fraction of the removed (recovered+deaths) population
fraction, which depends only on the reproduction number r. Finally, the
infected population curve is an almost symmetric function described by an
hyperbolic secant function.
