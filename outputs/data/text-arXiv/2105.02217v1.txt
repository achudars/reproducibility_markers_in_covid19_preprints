Abstract
We introduce a digital twin of the classical compartmental SIR (Susceptible, Infected,
Recovered) epidemic model and study the interrelation between the digital twin and the
system. In doing so, we use Stieltjes derivatives to feed the data from the real system to
the virtual model which, in return, improves it in real time. As a byproduct of the model,
we present a precise mathematical definition of solution to the problem. We also analyze
the existence and uniqueness of solutions, introduce the concept of Main Digital Twin and
present some numerical simulations with real data of the COVID-19 epidemic, showing the
accuracy of the proposed ideas.

1. Introduction
A digital twin (DT) can be defined as an evolving digital profile of the historical and
current behavior of a physical object or real process that helps optimize the performance of
the real process. It can also be defined as an avatar of a real physical system which exists
in the computer [7, 18]. It is important to warn that a DT is not just a mathematical
model or a virtual counterpart. It may be a classical mathematical model, but with the
plus of real-time inter-connections and feedback from the real product or system to the
virtual model and vice versa. A DT is, in other words, a virtual model representing its
physical counterpart which interacts with it in a continuous loop. The name comes from
a Roadmap report by John Vickers of NASA in 2010 in which the authors goal was to
improve the physical model simulation of spacecraft [17, 18].

A DT consists of three distinct parts, namely: the physical object or real system, the
digital/virtual model, and connections between these two objects. This method has been
applied to, e.g., aircraft engines [4, 21], wind turbines [20] and networks [1], just to cite
some of them -cf. [3]. The main idea is that the real and digital objects are related in a
way such that data flows from the real system to the virtual one, and the information from
the digital one is available to understand and predict the evolution of the real system, or
even act on it to modify its behavior. In this way, both objects interact in manner which
is twice beneficial: allowing the obtaining of a more accurate model and shaping the real
objects behavior accordingly.
The study of pandemics by using mathematical compartmental models can be traced
back to Kermack and McKendrick [16]. The objective of this method is to divide the total
population in disjoint groups or compartments, depending on the state of health, and then
study the spread level of a certain disease among the population. In this setting, every
individual in the same group has the same characteristics, which simplifies the study of the
model. The simplest epidemiological model is usually referred as SIR model and divides
the total (constant) population in three compartments, namely: Susceptible to infection
(those individuals who have not been previously exposed to the disease), Infected (those
individuals who have been infected by the illness) and Recovered (those who have passed
the disease). Despite its simplicity, the SIR model can yield powerfull insight in what
managing a pandemic concerns, so it has been applied to analyze the spread of COVID-19,
[9] among others. That said, there are many variations of the basic SIR model, and some
of those include other compartments such as exposed, hospitalized, or superspreaders [14],
and which consider classical or fractional derivatives [15].
The classical derivative can be also substituted by other operators such as Stieltjes
derivatives [11, 6]. This kind of derivatives (assuming that g is a continuous function at x)
can be pictured as taking the value
f (y) ‚àí f (x)
.
y‚Üíx g(y) ‚àí g(x)

fg0 (x) = lim

for some nondecreasing and left-continuous function g : R ‚Üí R. This mathematical
tool possesses many of the important properties of the usual derivative. Moreover, it is
extremely helpful when it comes to analyzing systems of differential equations with impulses
or latency periods [10]. In our case, the impulses can be understood as corrections made
to the initial model in order to take into consideration the new (real) data. Thereby, link
between DT and Stieltjes derivatives appears in a natural way.
The main aim of this work is to introduce a precise mathematical definition of a solution
to a digital twin, by using the Stieltjes derivative. Existence and uniqueness of solution are
obtained by considering the proposed definition. Reinterpreting the concept of the digital
twin as a Stieltjes differential equation allows us to study issues such as the existence and
uniqueness of the said concept from a mathematical point of view. As an example, we
will consider the simple SIR model to which we will feed real COVID-19 data which will
2

illustrate, in turn, the utility of this approach. Numerical experiments are also presented
to show the proposed definition and results.
The structure of this work is as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the basic definitions
and notations. More precisely, we present the classical SIR model by using classical derivatives, and introduce Stieltjes derivatives. In Section 3, we give a new interpretation of the
digital twin(s) by using the aforementioned Stieltjes derivatives and present a definition of
solution, as well as a result concerning the existence of solution to the corresponding system of differential equations. Numerical simulations are presented in Section 4, comparing
this approach to real data of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we include the conclusions
in Section 5.
2. Basic definitions and notations
Let us consider the SIR compartmental model
Ô£±
Ô£¥
S 0 (t) = ‚àíŒ≤ S(t) I(t),
Ô£¥
Ô£¥
Ô£≤
I 0 (t) = Œ≤ S(t) I(t) ‚àí Œ≥I(t),

Ô£≥R0 (t) = Œ≥ I(t),

(1)

representing the evolution of a disease at each time t ‚àà [0, T ] [2]. This is the so-called
nominal model and it is calibrated at an initial time. Here, as usual, we have considered
three compartments for the population, namely: S(t) denotes the population of susceptible
individuals to an infectious, but not deadly, disease at time t; I(t) stands for the population
of infected individuals at time t; and R(t) is used to represent the recovered individuals at
time t. We have used classical derivatives in the SIR model, and we have denoted by Œ≤ the
rate at which an infected person infects a susceptible person, and by Œ≥ the rate at which
infected people recover from the disease. There is no explicit solution to the SIR model
[8] and the numerical solution is usually calculated by using an appropriate numerical
method requiring initial conditions for S(t), I(t) and R(t), or by considering a power series
expansion [19]. We would like to recall that the definition of basic reproduction number,
R0 = population √ó

Œ≤
,
Œ≥

(2)

which can be understood as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single
infection in a completely susceptible population.
We will be working with Stieltjes derivatives, so it is necessary to introduce some
concepts regarding this kind of derivative. Let I ‚äÇ R be an interval and g : I ‚Üí R
a left-continuous non-decreasing function. We will refer to such functions as derivators.
Denote by œÑu the usual topology of R. We define the g-topology œÑg [6] as the family of
those sets U ‚äÇ I such that for every x ‚àà U there exists Œ¥ ‚àà R+ such that, if y ‚àà I satisfies
|g(y) ‚àí g(x)| < Œ¥, then y ‚àà U .
3

We say f is g-continuous at x0 ‚àà I if for every  ‚àà R+ there exists Œ¥ ‚àà R+ such that
|f (y) ‚àí f (x)| <  if |g(y) ‚àí g(x)| < Œ¥. We say f is g-continuous on I if it is g-continuous
at every point in I. It can be checked that a function f : (I, œÑg ) ‚Üí (R, œÑu ) is continuous if
and only if it is g-continuous [13, Lemma 6].
We define the set
Cg := {t ‚àà R : g is constant on (t ‚àí Œµ, t + Œµ) for some Œµ > 0}.
We also define Dg as the set of all discontinuity points of g. Observe that, given that g
is nondecreasing, we can write Dg = {t ‚àà R : ‚àÜ+ g(t) > 0} where ‚àÜ+ g(t) = g(t+ ) ‚àí g(t),
t ‚àà R, and g(t+ ) denotes the right handside limit of g at t.
Definition 1. Let g : [a, b] ‚Üí R be derivator and f : [a, b] ‚Üí R. We define the Stieltjes
derivative, or g‚Äìderivative, of f at a point t ‚àà R\Cg as
Ô£±
f (s) ‚àí f (t)
Ô£¥
Ô£¥
,
t 6‚àà Dg ,
Ô£≤ lim
s‚Üít g(s) ‚àí g(t)
0
fg (t) =
f (s) ‚àí f (t)
Ô£¥
Ô£¥
Ô£≥ lim
,
t ‚àà Dg ,
s‚Üít+ g(s) ‚àí g(t)
provided the corresponding limits exist. In that case, we say that f is g‚Äìdifferentiable at t.
Associated to g there is also a measure ¬µg defined as the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure
such that ¬µg ([a, b)) = g(b) ‚àí g(a). Obviously, for g(t) = t, we have fg0 (t) = f 0 (t), the usual
derivative.
3. The digital twin of a SIR model
Given the epidemiological compartmental model of SIR type detailed in (1), we can
construct its digital twin as

Ô£¥
Ô£¥
(t, ts ) = ‚àíŒ≤(ts )S(t, ts )I(t, ts ),
Ô£¥
Ô£¥

(t, ts ) = Œ≤(ts )S(t, ts )I(t, ts ) ‚àí Œ≥(ts )I(t, ts ),
Ô£¥

Ô£¥
Ô£¥
Ô£¥
Ô£¥
‚àÇR
Ô£¥
Ô£≥
(t, ts ) = Œ≥(ts )I(t, ts ),
‚àÇt
where t ‚àà [0, T ] and ts ‚àà [0, T ] are, respectively, the systems time and what we shall call,
for lack of a better name, ‚Äúslow time‚Äù [7]. The slow time ts can be thought of as a time
variable which is much slower than t, such as, for instance, the number of cycles of the
epidemic, some prescribed times at which the experimental data is available, or just a
different time scale of some sort which carries with it qualitative and quantitative changes
in the system which we have to take into consideration. These changes are represented by
the fact that Œ≤(ts ) and Œ≥(ts ) change with ts .
4

Thus, S, I, and R are functions of two variables, that is, the solution will depend also
on ts , so we can write S(t, ts ), I(t, ts ), R(t, ts ). As a consequence, the equations of the
dynamical system are expressed in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to the time
variable t. This will not imply that the SIR model (1) has turned into a partial differential
equation system since the infinitesimal dependence is restricted to the variable t.
For ts = 0 (the initial time) the digital twin reduces to the original model since the
only information available at that time is the initial conditions. It is important to observe
that the rates Œ≤(ts ) and Œ≥(ts ) are unknown, so it will be necessary to estimate them from
the data.
It is assumed that changes in Œ≤(ts ) and Œ≥(ts ) are so slow that the dynamics of (3) are
effectively decoupled from these functional variations. As a consequence, both Œ≤(ts ) and
Œ≥(ts ) are constant as far as the instantaneous dynamics of (3), as a function of the time t,
is concerned.
The system receives data and measures at times determined by ts . We can assume
that ts ‚àà Ts , where Ts = Ts ‚äÇ [0, T ] is a locally finite set. Since, in this case, we are
taking as time domain [0, T ] instead of R or [0, ‚àû), this implies that Ts is finite. We

write Ts = {tks }k‚â•0 and assume that t0s = 0 and tks < tk+1
s
k
mentioned, at each time ts , with k ‚â• 1, the system receives data that we can use to
estimate the parameters Œ≤(ts ) and Œ≥(ts ) and also to correct the evolution of the digital
twin. For example, suppose that at each of the times tks the system receives real data from
the variables S, I and R:
k
k M
k
k M
{(tkj , Sjk )}M
j=0 , {(tj , Ij )}j=0 , {(tj , Rj )}j=0 ,

where, if we assume that the times in Ts are evenly spaced by a time span Œ¥t > 0, tkj =
tks ‚àí jŒ¥t, j = 0, . . . , M , are the set of measurement times and Sjk , Ijk and Rjk , j = 0, . . . , M
are real data at times tkj , j = 0, . . . , M . In particular, tks = tk0 and it may happen that
tk‚àí1
‚àà {tkj : j = 0, . . . , M } if we consider overlap in the data that we will use to adjust the
s
coefficients Œ≥(ts ) and Œ≤(ts ). For instance, if the digital twin receives a data packet every
two days made up of real data of four days back and the periodicity of the data is daily
(Œ¥t = 1), we are in the previous situation (M + 1 = 4). For the first two elements of Ts we
have that:
‚Ä¢ t1s = 4 and {t1j }M
j=0 = {4, 3, 2, 1},
‚Ä¢ t2s = 6 and {t2j }M
j=0 = {6, 5, 4, 3}.
Note that in the above situation real data at times 2 and 4 are present in the data packets
that are received at times t1s = 4 and t2s = 6. However, the real data is often corrected
if errors are detected in the measurements. For example, in the context of the COVID
pandemic, the government of Spain frequently corrected previous real data when they
detected errors in the information received from the local governments. So, at each time
step tkj we have the opportunity of correcting possible errors. With these real data we can

estimate the value of the parameters Œ≥(tks ) and Œ≤(tks ):

Œ≥(tks ) ‚â° Œ≥ {(tkj , Sjk )}kj=0 , {(tkj , Ijk )}kj=0 , {(tkj , Rjk )}kj=0 ,

Œ≤(tks ) ‚â° Œ≤ {(tkj , Sjk )}kj=0 , {(tkj , Ijk )}kj=0 , {(tkj , Rjk )}kj=0 .
At time t0s we assume that Œ≥(t0s ) and Œ≤(t0s ) are known and also the initial data (S00 , I00 , R00 ).
Additionally, in order to fit the digital twin to the real data at the points tks , we will assume
that
S(tks , tks ) = S0k , I(tks , tks ) = I0k , R(tks , tks ) = R0k ,
for k ‚â• 0. Therefore, (3) can be expressed in the following terms:

Next, we shall introduce the concept of solution for the previous system (4). On the one
hand, it only makes sense to consider the solution at pairs (t, tks ), with t ‚â• tks , with k ‚â• 0.
Indeed, the system receives real data at time tks . Following the principle of causality, it
does not make sense to consider the solution at (t, tks ) with t < tks for the data provided
by tks is not yet available at time tk . On the other hand, given an element t ‚àà [0, T ], there
exists a finite number of pairs (t, tks ) with t ‚â• tks . Thus, we have a finite number of values
for S, I and R to chose from at time t:
‚Ä¢ If t ‚àà [t0s , t1s ), we have (S(t, t0s ), I(t, t0s ), R(t, t0s )).
‚Ä¢ If t ‚àà [t1s , t2s ), we have {(S(t, tks ), I(t, tks ), R(t, tks )), k = 0, 1}.
k
k
k
‚Ä¢ In general, if t ‚àà [tjs , tj+1
s ), we have {(S(t, ts ), I(t, ts ), R(t, ts )), k = 0, 1, . . . , j}.

‚Ä¢ If t ‚àà [sup Ts , T ], we have {(S(t, tks ), I(t, tks ), R(t, tks )), k ‚â• 0}.
As a consequence, we can define the solution to (4) in the following way.
Definition 2. The solution to the problem (4) is a multivalued map
G

DT : t ‚àà [0, T ] ‚Üí DT (t) ‚äÇ

where t denotes the disjoint union and
( 

t ‚àà [sup Ts , T ],

and each triple (S(¬∑, tks ), I(¬∑, tks ), R(¬∑, tks )) is a solution to system (1) on [tks , tk+1
) (or on
s
[sup Ts , T ]) subject to the initial conditions S(tks ) = S k , I(tks ) = I k , R(tks ) = Rk and with
Œ≤s Œ≥s instead of Œ≤ and Œ≥ respectively.
Remark 3. If we are willing to lose the information regarding which value ts generates
which point in R3 , we can simplify the definition to a multivalued map
DT : t ‚àà [0, T ] ‚Üí DT (t) ‚äÇ R3 ,
where
( 
(S(t, tks ), I(t, tks ), R(t, tks )), k = 0, 1, . . . , j , t ‚àà [tjs , tj+1
s ), j ‚â• 0,
DT (t) = 
(S(t, tks ), I(t, tks ), R(t, tks )), k ‚â• 0 ,
t ‚àà [sup Ts , T ].
From the previous multivalued solution, we can define the concept of the Main Digital
Twin (MDT) as the ‚Äúbest forecast‚Äù that we can make at all times. We assume that this
best forecast at a time t corresponds to the branch associated with the closest previous tks
element.
Definition 4. Under the previous hypotheses, we define the Main Digital Twin (MDT) as
follows:
M DT : t ‚àà [0, T ] ‚Üí M DT (t)
(

(S(t, tks ), I(t, tks ), R(t, tks )),
t ‚àà (tks , tk+1

and this limit is not, in general, equal to M DT (tks ) = (S(tk , tk‚àí1

In some way, the main digital twin can be interpreted as the solution to a system of

Differential equations with impulses are a special case of differential equations with Stieltjes

of a system of differential equations with Stieltjes derivatives. We have the following result.

Proof. The proof is a particular case of [12, Theorem 3.43] which itself draws from [11,
Section 3.2]. We include an adaptation for the convenience of the reader. First of all, note
that the derivator (9) is well defined in the sense that it is non decreasing function and left+
continuous. We must observe that, given an element tks ‚àà Ts \{t0s }, g(tks )‚àíg(tks ) = 2‚àík > 0.
So let us see now each of the conditions separately:
‚Ä¢ Let x be an element that solves (8). Given an element t ‚àà Ts \ {t0s } we have, since
Ts = Ts , that:
lim
s‚Üít

xj (s) ‚àí xk (t)
xj (s) ‚àí xk (t)
= lim
, j = 1, 2, 3.
s‚Üít
gs (s) ‚àí gs (t)
t‚àís

Therefore we have that (xj )0g (t) exists if and only if x0j (t) exists and both derivatives
are equal, so:
x0gs (t) = F(t, x(t)), gs ‚àí a.e t ‚àà [0, T ] \ (Ts \ {t0s }).
Finally, given an element tks ‚àà Ts \ {t0s }, we have that:
(xj )0gs (tks )

+
Itks j (x(tks ))
xj (tks ) ‚àí xj (tks )
=
=
,
gs (tks + ) ‚àí gs (tks )
gs (tks + ) ‚àí gs (tks )

and then
x0gs (tks ) = Fs (tks , x(tks )), ‚àÄ tks ‚àà Ts \ {t0s }.
‚Ä¢ Let x be an element that solves (10). Given an element t ‚àà [0, T ] \ (Ts \ {t0s }), we
can proceed as in the previous case and we have that
x0 (t) = f (t, x(t)), m ‚àí a.e. t ‚àà [0, T ].
Finally, for elements tks ‚àà Ts \ {t0s }:
+

+

x(tks ) = x(tks ) + x0g (tks ) (g(tks ) ‚àí g(tks )) = x(tks ) + Itks (x(tks )),
which concludes the proof.

Remark 6. Observe that:
‚Ä¢ We have encoded in the derivator the times at which the main digital twin interacts
with the real model.
‚Ä¢ In the term Fs we have coded how the real data correct the evolution of the main
digital model. This correction is materialized in the modification of the parameters
Œ≤ and Œ≥, and in the correction of the main digital model at the times at which it
interacts with the real model.
9

Therefore, the concept of the main digital twin (4) can be understood in the following
sense.
Definition 7 (Main Digital Twin). We say that a function x ‚àà [AC g ([0, T ])]3 , with x(0) =
(S00 , I00 , R00 ) is a main digital twin of (4) if
x0gs (t) = Fs (t, x(t)), gs ‚àí a.e. t ‚àà [0, T ].

(11)

Next we show a local result of existence and uniqueness for the main digital twin
associated to (4) in the case Ts finite.
Theorem 8 (Local existence and uniqueness of the main digital twin for (4)). Assume
Ts finite. Then there exists œÑ ‚àà (0, T ] such that (4) has an unique solution in the interval
[0, œÑ ).
Proof. The proof is a particular case of [6, Theorem 7.4.]. For r > 0 arbitrary we shall
check the hypothesis of [6, Theorem 7.4.]. In this case, the funcion Fs occurring in (11) is
given by
Ô£±
/ Ts \ {t0s },
Ô£¥
Ô£≤ (‚àíŒ≤s (t) x1 x2 , Œ≤s (t) x1 x2 ‚àí Œ≥s (t) x2 , Œ≥s (t) x2 , ) , t ‚àà
Fs (t, (x1 , x2 , x3 )) =
(S0k ‚àí x1 , I0k ‚àí x2 , R0k ‚àí x3 )
Ô£¥
,
tks ‚àà Ts \ {t0s }.
Ô£≥
gs ((tks )+ ) ‚àí gs (tks )
‚Ä¢ For every x ‚àà B ((S00 , I00 , R00 ), r), where we are considering the euclidean norm in R3 ,
the function Fs (¬∑, x) is clearly Borel measurable, in particular, g-measurable.
‚Ä¢ It is clear from (6) that Œ≤s , Œ≥s ‚àà L1g ([0, T )), so Fs (¬∑, (S00 , I00 , R00 )) ‚àà L1g ([0, T )) as well.
‚Ä¢ Given x, y ‚àà B ((S00 , I00 , R00 ), r), we have for t ‚àà [0, T ] \ (Ts \ {t0s }):
|F1 (t, x) ‚àí F1 (t, y)| ‚â§ |Œ≤s (t)| (kxk + kyk) kx ‚àí yk,
|F2 (t, x) ‚àí F2 (t, y)| ‚â§ [|Œ≤s (t)| (kxk + kyk) + |Œ≥s (t)|] kx ‚àí yk,
|F3 (t, x) ‚àí F3 (t, y)| ‚â§ |Œ≥s (t)| kx ‚àí yk.
On the other hand, given an element tks ‚àà Ts \ {t0s },
|Fj (tks , x) ‚àí Fj (tks , y)| ‚â§

g(tks + )

Thus if we denote by:

‚àí g(t) s s

we have that:

From now on, in order to simplify the matters, we will assume that [0, T ) the maximal
interval in which Theorem 8 is fulfilled.
4. Numerical simulations
In this section we will present the numerical results that we have obtained using real
data from the evolution of the COVID in Galicia (Spain). In our case we have considered
real data from the May 2, 2020 (day 1) to April 11, 2021 (day 344). It is important to
mention that real data were available since March 13, 2020, however, due to the change
in the data collection methodology that took place on April 29, 2020, we have considered
it appropriate to only take into account data from May 2, 2020 on. In figures 1-2 the
evolution of the susceptible, infectious and recovered individuals is represented in the time
period described above.

Figure 1: Susceptible Individuals. Real data from May 2, 2020 (day 1) to April 11, 2021

11

Figure 2: Infectious and Recovered Individuals. Real data from May 2, 2020 (day 1) to April 11, 2021

For the numerical simulations we have considered that the digital twin receives data
each 7 days and we have used M + 1 = 15 days for adjusting the coefficients Œ≤ and Œ≥.
Thus, t0s = 1, t1s = 15, tks = tk‚àí1
+ 7, for k ‚â• 2. The adjustment of the coefficients Œ≤(t1s )
s

and Œ≥(ts ) will be carried out using the data collected at times {1, . . . , 15}, for adjusting
Œ≤(t2s ) and Œ≥(t2s ) we have used data collected at times {8, . . . , 22}, and so on.
To fit the data we have used a classical fitting method based on solving the following

To solve numerically the previous equation we have used the Matlab command ode45 and,
for solving the optimization problem (12), we have used the fminsearch Matlab function.
12

Computations have been performed on a 2019 MacBook Pro (2,5 GHz Intel Core i5 with
4 kernels). The CPU time required to make the 48 adjustments was 6.88 seconds. We
observe that in the fitting process we have not used the S variable due to two reasons. On
the one hand, the different scale in the data could produce unsatisfactory adjustments and,
on the other, the variable S can be obtained from the previous ones taking into account
the size of the population (2.702.592 individuals), so it is not necessary at the optimization
step. In figures 3-4 and 5-6 we include two examples of the fitting process for t1s = 15 and
t17
s = 127, respectively.

In the next figures we present the evolution of the digital twin (DT) solution to the
multivalued problem (4): in Figure 7 we find the evolution of the multivalued solution
for the susceptible individuals (note that we have restricted the scale for a better display
of the results); in figures 8 and 9 we show the evolution for the infectious and recovered individuals, respectively. Observe that given a time t ‚àà [tjs , tj+1
s ), we have j + 1
forecasts {(S(t, tks ), I(t, tks ), R(t, tks )), k = 0, 1, . . . , j}. In these figures, the continuous nonemphasized lines correspond to realities that would have occurred if the conditions for
the spread of the pandemic had not been modified (confinement, social distancing, use of
masks, etc.). In this way, the multivalued solution introduced (Definition 2) implies that
the same situation can be reached at a given moment from different previous situations.
14

Of course, some potential realities were avoided due to different measures implemented by
the authorities. Now, it is also the case with vaccination against COVID-19. We would
also like also to highlight that the basic reproduction number (2) changes in the period of
analysis, as represented in Figure 10.

masks and/or other policies to stop the spread of the pandemic

Now, we will consider the Main Digital Twin (MDT) as the best forecast that we
can make at all times (5). In Figure 11 we represent the evolution of the Main Digital
Twin for the susceptible individuals; in Figure 12 the evolution of MDT associated to the
infectious individuals, and in Figure 13, the evolution for the recovered individuals. All
of the numerical simulations have been done using the ode45 Matlab function. The total
CPU time required to perform the complete simulation of MDT was 0.18 seconds.

Finally we will compare the Main Digital Twin in terms of definition (5) with the
solution of the Stieltjes differential equation (11). The numerical approximation of the solution to a system of Stieltjes differential equations was introduced in [5] where a predictorcorrector numerical scheme to approximate the solution to a Stieljes dieferential equation
(also for systems) from a quadrature formula for the Lebesgue Stieltjes integral was de+1

duced. For this, a finite set of times {tj }N

t0 = T , tN +1 = T and tk+1 ‚àí tk = h > 0, for every k = 1, . . . , N . The application of the
number scheme in our case consists of: given an element x0 = (S00 , I00 , R00 ), we compute

for every j = 0, . . . , N and i = 1, 2, 3, being xj = (x1,j , x2,j , x3,j ). For the numerical
simulations that we will present below we have considered h = 0.5. In figures 14-16, the
comparison between the numerical solution to (5) using ode45 and the solution to (11) using the scheme (13) for the susceptible, infectious and recovered individuals. Although the
calculation of the distance between the numerical approximation of (5) and the numerical
approximation (11) is not relevant since both are numerical approximations, in the simulations carried out we have observed a maximum difference of 1.07e + 01 for the susceptible
individuals, 4.08e + 00 for the infectious individuals and 2.48e + 00 for the recovered individuals. If we consider h = 0.25, we obtain a maximum difference of 5.56e ‚àí 01, 5.65e ‚àí 01
and 2.24e + 00 for, respectively, the susceptible, infectious and recovered individuals. The
18

CPU time required to perform the simulation in the case h = 0.5 was 0.14 seconds and
0.15 seconds in the case h = 0.25.

5. Conclusions
The rise of digital twins motivated by industrial requirements puts into focus the need
for this relatively new concept to be addressed and formalized in a clear and rigorous
way. In this letter we propose a digital twin for a SIR mathematical compartmental
model. In doing so, Stieltjes derivatives have been used intensively giving rise to a precise
definition of solution. We have also analyzed the existence and uniqueness of the solution
to the mathematical problem. Moreover, we have applied the proposed ideas to a specific
problem: the spread of the pandemic of COVID-19 in Galicia. The numerical experiments
performed show that the proposed definitions and results can be used to explain other
pandemics.
