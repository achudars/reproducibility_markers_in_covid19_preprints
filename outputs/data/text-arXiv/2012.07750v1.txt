Abstract
Application of information technology in the era of big data and cloud computing has led
to the trend of electronic payments through financial technology, or FinTech. One of the
most popular FinTech applications in Indonesia is Go-Pay in the Gojek start-up
application. This research will analyze how the FinTech Go-Pay user experience both for
transactions on Gojek and at merchants that collaborate with Gojek. User Experience (UX)
is analyzed using the User Experience Questionnaire which consists of 6 (six) variables
(Attractiveness, Perspicuity, Efficiency, Dependability, Stimulation, and Novelty). Total
data collected amounted to 258. After analyzing the calculation results, the mean scores
are obtained in the following order: Efficiency, Perspicuity, Stimulation, Attractiveness,
Dependability, and Novelty. Then when compared with benchmark data the following
sequence is obtained: Efficiency, Perspicuity, Stimulation, Attractiveness, Dependability,
and Novelty. Overall the Go-Pay service is efficient and perspicuity, but the Go-Pay
service needs to improve its novelty. This article provides additional knowledge or novelty
contributions, especially for user experience analysis using FinTech applications.
Keywords: Cloud Computing, COVID-19, FinTech, Go-Pay, Online Transportation

1. INTRODUCTION
Progress in the development of information technology (IT) has entered a new era
and changed many behaviors and habits. With IT, the transfer and exchange of
data and information that were previously done manually can now be done online
and connected regardless of time and distance. The internet allows sending data
from source to destination in various forms. The internet has now become the
global communication standard in all aspects of life, including in e-commerce and
transportation sector, such as online ride sharing [1]. Adjusting information
technology-based to human behavior [2] is the primary deal of Human Aspects,
Ergonomics, Interaction of Human and Computer and Usability approach. the
deliberative result of the user experience remains notable at the post-usage stage
[3] for both web and mobile based applications.
The internet has also helped human activities when the corona virus outbreak
struck in late 2019 and early 2020. The corona virus was originally called the
"2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)", then by WHO officially on February 11,

265

2020 it was named "COVID-19" [4] caused by SARS-CoV-2 [5]. The COVID-19
outbreak has not only overwhelmed the country of China (as the beginning of the
plague) [6], but even a number of developed countries were overwhelmed by it.
Italy is the worst European country to be hit by COVID-19. The Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia even limits the annual regular visits that have been held for
thousands of years, namely the “Umrah”. In fact, many countries are
implementing the "LockDown" policy to limit the spread of COVID-19. But with
the internet and also smartphones, as one of ubiquitous computing, has changed
the trend of communication and transactions. Almost all applications that
previously operated on a personal computer or laptop can be run from a
smartphone alone. Even today the smartphone has shifted to the basic needs of
every human being in urban areas especially. During the bleak period of COVID19, many people's activities were carried out through the internet, laptops, and
smartphones that were done from home (Work from Home, WFH).
Until early 2020, internet and smartphone users around the world are estimated to
reach fantastic numbers. In 2020, it is predicted that the Pew Research Center will
be dominated by the use of the internet on mobile devices [7]. Furthermore,
smartphone [8] have been transformed into individual assistants, enjoyment
gadgets, information portals. Indonesia itself is a country with high internets and
smartphone penetration. The use of smartphones and personal computers in
Indonesia is more related to the capacity for handling information in everyday life
[9]. Indonesian internet users rank fourth in the world, third in Asia, and first in
ASEAN.
Activities of internet users in surfing the web and social media have formed an
ecosystem called the big data. This big data ecosystem requires a cloud-based
platform [10]. Cloud computing [11], [12] is a powerful technology for largescale and complex computing. The six existing start-up businesses (Table 1) all
utilize big data and cloud computing technology.

The existence of these new technologies has made a number of information
technology-based businesses flourish in Indonesia. In fact, there is at least 1 (one)
start-up that is classified as “decacorn” and 4 (four which is included in the
unicorn category [13]. In 2020 one Market Place startup reaches the unicorn
status. Table 1 shows 6 (six) top Indonesian startups that developed in the era of
big data, cloud computing and ubiquitous computing.

Corona COVID-19 [6] virus sourced from Wuhan, China, has spread throughout
the world. A number of countries have also begun implementing social distancing
policies until lockdown. Transmission of the virus does not only occur due to
proximity or contracting directly from the patient, but also indirectly contracting,
for example through money intermediaries when payment transactions occur. So
that minimizing the use of transactions with physical money should be done as
much as possible. Transactions with physical money can be replaced by making
transactions using virtual money in e-wallets and transacting with financial
technology (FinTech).
The business sectors have been utilized IT as virtual media [14] both for sellers
and buyers to create online transactions or virtual shopping. The new digital
economic environment requires new payment transaction services as well. In
other words, the transaction payment activities have also changed. Payments
using physical money turn into virtual money made using financial technology
(FinTech) applications. FinTech is the adoption of advances in information
technology in the financial services industry [15]. National governments always
play a critical role in fostering adoption of ICT-related indicators [16]. The
adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT) fosters economic
growth in Indonesia. FinTech appears to be significantly driving economic
growth in their second year [17], and The FinTech industry also promises to
reduce costs, as well as improve access to financial services [18]. In the FinTech
era, all financial activities were digitized with an internet-based transaction mode
and could be accessed by a website or smart device known as a smartphone. This
research will continue the previous activity which analyzed the online
transportation mobile application, Gojek [13]. Gojek itself as a technology-based
business player from the beginning has introduced a digital payment system
through the Go-Pay service on the Gojek application. This research will focus on
payment transaction service, FinTech, which is provided by Gojek, Go-Pay.
Through Go-Pay, Gojek has facilities for corporate financial services [19]. GoPay also considered successful in implementing financial inclusion and digital
economy in Indonesia.
A number of studies have discussed Go-Pay as an alternative to digital payments.
Previous research discusses how the influence of "trust" on users who will use
online transactions [20]. They concluded that trust is affected by social influence
and self-efficacy. Subsequent research discusses a descriptive analysis of Go-Pay
users in Surabaya [21], which is dominated by women, age group Y generation,
and high school education equivalent. Another research used technology
Acceptance Model (TAM) to understand consumer intention to use Go-Pay [22].
And the last research discussed the process of adoption interest in using digital
wallet of Go-Pay users in Central Jakarta [23].

None of the studies have raised a theme related to "user experience" when using
financial technology services when conducting online transactions. That's why
this study will analyze the user experience in using the FinTech application.

2. METHODS
The research approach applied in this study is a quantitative method that is
combined with observations, interviews, and filling out the questionnaires online.
The novelty used in this method includes research objects that have never been
previously reviewed or analyzed with user experience.
2.1. Respondents
Respondents in this study were computer science students who belong to the
Millennial and Z generations. The students have initial knowledge related to the
development of technology based on big data, cloud computing, human-computer
interaction (HCI), financial technology (FinTech), global positioning system
(GPS), research methodology, smartphones, etc. The 21st century will indeed be
dominated by social and business activities by the millennial generation and Z.
2.2. Research Object
The object of this research is the FinTech Go-Pay service that is available on the
online transportation service, Gojek. Gojek is an ojek booking service through the
Gojek application that can be downloaded on an Android Smartphone [24]. The
modes of transportation between shuttles by using the media to call gadgets or
smartphones online [25]. Go-Pay is used by Gojek customers to make virtual
payments. Besides being commonly used for transactions on Gojek, Go-Pay can
also be used for payment transactions at many merchants that work with Gojek.
Go-Pay can be imagined as an e-Wallet that can be filled in with the balance.
With the balance in Go-Pay, users can use the balance the same as using physical
money. Even in early 2020, Go-Pay has added PayLater service to its selected
users. With the PayLater facility, selected Gojek customers can enjoy a variety of
Gojek services with payments made at the end of the current month.
Payment for services in the Gojek application will be deducted automatically.
Meanwhile, to make payments at merchants with Go-Pay, users can simply scan
the barcode that is at the intended merchant. After a successful scan, then enter
the nominal to be paid. If the transaction is successful, the Go-Pay balance will be
reduced and the transaction slip will be printed from the machine at the merchant.
With QR Code technology [26], it makes it easier for buyers to make payment
transactions based on FinTech Go-Pay. In Indonesia, mobile commerce or mcommerce [27] is growing very rapidly and is now widely used by a number of
customers. Gojek super application through mobile wallet, Go-Pay, has expanded
financial access for millions of people in Indonesia.

2.3. User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ)
UEQ is a tool that can be used to measure User Experience (UX) for both web
and mobile based applications. UEQ contains 6 (six) scales or UX variables,
namely: 1) Attractiveness, 2) Efficiency, 3) Perspicuity, 4) Dependability, 5)
Stimulation, and 6) Novelty [28]. Each scale is represented by an average of 4
(four) indicator items, except the Attractiveness variable contains 6 (six) items
[29] (Table 2). This questionnaire is a measure that is easy to apply, reliable, and
valid for the user experience [30].
UEQ is a semantic differential with a 7-point Likert scale for the answer. Each
question item represents 2 (two) terms with opposite meanings [31]. The lowest
score represents the most negative side, while the highest score represents the
most positive value. The experience variables and indicators shown in Table 2.

2.4. Data Collection
Data is collected by utilizing social technology (SosTech) facilities from Google,
Google Forms. After the questionnaire was created using Google Forms, it was
then distributed through a number of Facebook Groups, WhatsApp Group, etc.
Google Forms has the facilities needed by creating standard questionnaires

2.5. Data Analysis
Google Forms [32] has the ability to display collected data in the form of
worksheets. The data in the worksheets can be converted to a number of file
formats. One of the most flexible file formats to accommodate questionnaire data
is in the Microsoft Excel format.
Data that has been in the form of an excel file can then be processed
automatically through the Data Analysis Tool provided by the user experience
questionnaire (https://www.ueq-online.org/). Questionnaire entries were
transformed into values to be processed.
The sequence of positive and negative terms for an item is randomly generated in
the questionnaire. Per dimension half of the items start with positive and half with
negative terms. The value +3 represents the most positive value and -3 the most
negative value, as shown in Figure 2.

3.2 Go-Pay Service on the Gojek Application
FinTech services on the Gojek Application are located on the online payment
system, Go-Pay. The information position of the Go-Pay service is at the third
section (Figure 3) which shows the active Go-Pay balance. Under the Go-Pay
label there is a pay menu, promos, top up, and more.

Figure 3. Display of go-pay in the gojek application
In the Go-Ride service payment scheme, the balance will be deducted
automatically when a transaction between passenger and driver occurs. For
payments to merchants that work with Gojek, there is a "Pay" button facility
under Go-Pay, as shown in Figure 4. Click the button and navigate to the QR
Code on the merchant.
One of the payment methods embedded in smartphones is technology “QR
(Quick Response) codes” or “QR-Code” [40]. QR-Code or barcode to read an
identity [26]. The Go-Pay service provides a number of ways to do transactions,
namely: 1) Auto Debit, 2) Mobile Number, 3) Bank Account, and 4) Scan QR
Code, as shown in Figure 4.

Through the Regulation of Members of the Board of Governors “No:
21/18/PADG/2019 chapters 4 and 5”, Bank Indonesia encourages the use of QR
Code in conducting digital transactions. The term used is “Quick Response Code
Indonesian Standard” hereinafter referred to QRIS. QRIS is expected to facilitate
non-cash transactions of Indonesian society.
3.3 Mean and Variance
The mean and variance of each can be seen in Table 4. The mean range starts
from 1.310 to 1.528. Values between -0.8 and 0.8 represent evaluations that are
more or less neutral than the corresponding scale, values> 0.8 represent positive
evaluations and values <-0.8 represent negative evaluations. The scale range is
between -3 (very bad) and +3 (very good).

4. CONCLUSION
This paper filled the research gap in analysis FinTech application in Indonesia,
especially related to user experience. The results of the study as a whole showed
that all user experience variables for Go-Pay applications are above the average
and good categories. But none of the variables reached the score in the excellent
category. There is only one variable that gets a score in the "good" category, that
is, the "stimulation" variable. Payment for Gojek services such as Go-Car and GoRide that can be automatically paid as long as the balance of Go-Pay contains
makes the Go-Pay service considered to have a good level of efficiency. With big
data analysis, Go-Pay services can read service trends that are commonly used by
Gojek customers, so that it can facilitate the Gojek to provide stimulation in the
form of promos that are tailored to the needs and habits of the customer. There
are five variables that get a score in the "above average" category based on
benchmark scores, namely: 1) Attractiveness, 2) Perspicuity, 3) Efficiency, 4)
Dependability, and 5) novelty. The highest score sequence is achieved by variable
1) "Efficiency", followed by variables 2) "Stimulation", 3) "Attractiveness", 4)
"Perspicuity", 5) Dependability, and 6) "Novelty". The novelties in the articles of
this research include: 1) Research objects that have never been analyzed with
previous user experience, 2) Respondents who are mostly millennial and z
generations, 3) The results of the analysis are also equipped with benchmarks
against a number of other products. For further research, the authors are interested
in finding out the user experience of Grab users, and FinTech, OVO payment
services. As well as making comparisons for the two FinTech applications.
