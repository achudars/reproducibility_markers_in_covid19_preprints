How does stock market reflect the change in economic demand?
A study on the industry-specific volatility spillover networks of China’s stock market during
the outbreak of COVID-19
Fu Qiao Yan Yan
Abstract：Using the carefully selected industry classification standard, we divide 102 industry
securities indices in China’s stock market into four demand-oriented sector groups and identify
demand-oriented industry-specific volatility spillover networks. The "demand-oriented" is a new
idea of reconstructing the structure of the networks considering the relationship between industry
sectors and the economic demand their outputs meeting. Networks with the new structure help us
improve the understanding of the economic demand change, especially when the macroeconomic
is dramatically influenced by exogenous shocks like the outbreak of COVID-19. At the beginning
of the outbreak of COVID-19, in China's stock market, spillover effects from industry indices of
sectors meeting the investment demand to those meeting the consumption demands rose
significantly. However, these spillover effects fell after the outbreak containment in China
appeared to be effective. Besides, some services sectors including utility, transportation and
information services have played increasingly important roles in the networks of industry-specific
volatility spillovers as of the COVID-19 out broke. By implication, firstly, being led by Chinese
government, the COVID-19 is successfully contained and the work resumption is organized with a
high efficiency in China. The risk of the investment demand therefore was controlled and
eliminated relatively fast. Secondly, the intensive using of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
led to supply restriction in services in China. It will still be a potential threat for the Chinese
economic recovery in the next stage.
Key words: volatility spillover network, GARCH-BEKK, industry classification, China’s
stock market, securities industry index, macro economy, demand, supply restriction.

1. Introduction
In stock market, it is a frequent occurrence that the fluctuations in stock prices initially occur
in companies belonging to one industry sector, and gradually spread to those belonging to other
ones. China’s stock market has become the second largest stock market all over the world. Up to
January 2020, 3780 companies belonging to variety of sectors listed their shares in China’s stock
market. The market value of these shares was more than 60.38 billion RMBs (roughly equals to
8.65 trillion US dollars). Thus, it is fairly important for both investors and policymakers all over
the world to understand the complex linkage effect showed in fluctuations in stock prices (or
yields) of companies of different sectors in China’s stock market.
One of the typical measurements of the linkage characteristics between different variables is
spillover effect. The spillover effect mainly consists of the mean spillover effect and the volatility
spillover effect. This paper highlighted the volatility spillover effect, which reflects the contagion
direction of information and the transmission structure of risk between different securities.
Theoretically, the volatility spillover effect is led by the incomplete information. Any occurrence
of the new information will possibly lead to price changes in multiple classes of securities.
However, it takes time for information being transmitted between the investors with preferences
for different classes of securities. Investors focusing on a specific securities class will always
obtain the information that possibly has direct influence on the prices of securities of this class
earlier. The investors’ out-of-sync information observing leads to the out-of-sync price changes in
securities of different classes. As the result, the volatility spillover effect occurs among the
fluctuations in different securities prices [1]1. The linkage level of volatility spillover effect can be
measured by using GARCH family models (models such as BEKK-GARCH and DCC-GARCH)
or the variance decomposition model under the VAR framework. [2-5] 2345. Research on spillover
effect across markets used to employ daily data, while high-frequency data has been increasingly
used in recent literature [6-8].678
It has become a popular perspective analyzing the interaction across social and economic
units basing on the concepts of network topology [9].9 A significant strand of literature has
introduced the theory of complex networks into the study when analyzing the spillover effect
across multiple financial institutions or markets [10, 11]1011. The literatures on spillover networks
analysis of financial markets mainly focused on the spillovers across financial markets in different
countries’ (or regions’) [12, 13] 1213, the spillovers between different asset categories and those
between different industry sectors [14-16].141516
For researches on spillover networks analysis across financial markets of different countries’,
there have been conclusions with high consistency and interpretability in. According to existing
literatures on this topic, the nodes representing the securities indices or portfolios of financial
markets of developed countries always played a dominated role in the spillover networks [17,
18].1718 Many researches also illustrated that the spillovers between the financial markets of
emerging market countries and those of developed ones have rapidly increased after the financial
crisis in 2007, while they were relatively isolated with each other before the financial crisis
[19-21]. 192021
Owing to two main reasons, the findings of researches on networks of spillovers across
global financial markets are inspiring and easy to understand. On the one hand, the nodes
representing financial markets of different countries or regions’ can be easily classified with
geographic or economic standards [13, 22]22. On the other hand, there are various extensively
2

researched theories of international economy and finance, which can be introduced to explain the
spillovers.
Take another look at researches on industry-specific spillover networks analysis. Early
researches on this topic showed that exogenous shocks to macro economy of one country do not
lead to the fluctuations in prices of all securities in this country at the same time [23-25]. 232425
Being inspired by these literatures, we further considered demand structure influences
industry-specific spillover networks. The demand of a country mainly consists of the demand for
consumption, investment and export. One of the critical things to the profit and asset price of the
companies that if their goods or services successfully meet a part of demand or not [26, 27]. 2627
The exogenous shock has different potential influences on different parts of demand, and it will
change the companies’ profitability and their asset prices at different levels depending on the
industry sector they belong. The securities industry index can be viewed as a representative of the
asset price of all companies in this industry sector. The influence of exogenous shock on economic
demand therefore should be reflected in the structural change in the industry-specific volatility
spillover networks.
Differing from the early researches, the recent ones on industry-specific volatility spillover
networks highlighted the measurement of the linkage level. These researches were initially
motivated by finding the arbitrage opportunities between assets of upstream industry sectors and
those of downstream ones in supply chain. Besides, literatures like [12, 28] 28further found that
the volatility spillovers also exists between industry sectors without direct input-output
relationship.
However, existing literatures did not answer the question about how could industry-specific
volatility spillover networks reflect the economic demand and its changes. We believe that there
are two reasons should be blamed. Firstly, it is more difficult to give a proper explanation for the
findings in industry-specific volatility spillover networks analysis than giving explanation for
those of analysis across countries or regions. A part of the detected spillovers in the networks
might match the economics theory, such as the spillovers between the energy sector and the
finance sector, or those of the transportation sector and the consumption sector [16, 29]. 29
However, the rest of spillovers in networks might not be properly explained. Especially, when
introducing the max spanning tree or some clustering methods, spillover paths or sub-networks
that consist of a large number of nodes will be generated. Then it would be even harder to explain
for the findings [30]. 30Secondly, some scholars have criticized the arbitrariness when selecting
industry classification standards. Literature [31] pointed out that the industry classification
standard should be cautiously selected depending on the research targets. When it is necessary,
self-built industry indices should also be used for pursuing more meaningful numerical results and
theoretical implication [31, 32]. 3132
Most of the researches on industry-specific spillover network analysis of China’s stock
market chose the industry classification standard made by China Securities Index Co., ltd (the CSI
standard) [12,28,30]. However, the CSI standard cannot match all research targets. According to
the CSI standard, the categories of “consumption goods” and “capital goods” are not parallel with
each other. Companies supplying goods or services for meeting the consumption demand can be
classified as sectors (level 1 categories) “consumer staples” or “consumer discretionary”. In
contrast, companies meeting the investment demand cannot be classified as a sector. They can
only be classified as an industry group (a level 2 category) “capital goods” which belongs to the
3

sector “industrial”. Thus, the spillover network analysis using the CSI standard cannot reflect the
economic demand and its change in a proper way.
Inspired by the structural transformation theory, we believe that the industry sectors can be
further classified as groups by the kind of the demand their goods or services meet. Literatures [33]
and [34] 3334used the World Input-Output Tables (WIOT, [35] 35) to reorganize the industry
classification from the perspective of the demand. Note that the WIOT is not suitable for
classifying listed companies. Instead, we introduced the industry classification standard made by
SWS Research Co., Ltd., which is the largest securities research institute in Mainland China. The
SWS standard divided the industry sectors into four sector groups, each of which is homogenous
in meeting specific economic demand. Specifically, the “equipment manufacturing” and “capital
goods” are sector groups meeting the investment demand in China. The “consumption goods” is
the group meeting the consumption demand. Besides, some service sectors meet neither purely the
consumption demand nor the investment demand. Those sectors are therefore classified as a group
called “unclassified services”. We call the industry-specific volatility spillover network basing on
the SWS standard as the demand-oriented industry-specific volatility spillover network. This
network can reflect the economic demand change better through the financial market than the
network basing on CSI standard.
Therefore, using the SWS standard, we identified the GARCH-BEKK based
demand-oriented industry-specific volatility spillover networks of China’s stock market. Each
node in the networks represents a level 2 industry securities index in the SWS industry list. We
chose the minute-per-minute return data of 102 SWS industry indices as the sample. The study
period is between the January 2 and March 20, 2020. In this period, as a typical exogenous shock,
the outbreak of the COVID-19 dramatically changed the economic demand in China.
Recent literatures have reported the influence of COVID-19 on both the macro economy and
financial markets of different countries or regions’. Some of them focused on the impact of the
disease on the financial market in a single country [36-38] 363738or the overall impact on global
financial markets [39, 40] 3940. Furthermore, in literatures [41, 42] 4142, industry-specific networks
were identified basing on macroeconomic data rather than the data from financial markets. These
literatures provided us good inspirations for further designing the research on illustrating how
industry-specific volatility spillover networks can reflect the economic demand change. Our study
extends the literature and contributes to the following aspects.
(1) From the perspective of demand, we purposed a new idea for reconstructing the structure
of the industry-specific spillover network. By reorganizing the industry securities indices into
demand-oriented sector groups, a better linkage between the theories of macroeconomics and the
industry-specific network analysis of financial market can be therefore obtained.
(2) We provided an early report of the structural change in the industry-specific volatility
spillover networks of China’s financial market around the outbreak of COVID-19. We further
analyzed how the changes in this network reflected the changes in economic demand caused by
the disease. Meanwhile, because of using the intraday data, we avoided being trapped by the
“dimension curse” [43] which is common in research on short and rapid exogenous shocks. 43
(3) A list of new economic implications was found from the numerical result. Firstly, during
the entire study period, there were stable spillovers from the sector group “capital goods” to the
group “consumption goods”. The spillovers from sector groups “capital goods” and “equipment
manufacturing”, which are represent the demand for investment, to other sector groups rose
4

significantly at the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19. However, these spillovers fell about
one month later. Secondly, the level of spillovers from the sector group “unclassified services”
was continuously rising during the whole study period. This rising trend reflected that the
intensive using of non-pharmaceutical interventions (a.k.a. NPIs) [44] in China caused the
supply restriction in services, and therefore had an overall impact on all kinds of demand.44
Researches using the CSI standard usually found the consumer discretionary sector or the
industrial sector as the origin of volatility spillovers of the networks [12, 45]. 45 Our findings are
consistent with existing literatures to many aspects. However, considering the extreme exogenous
shock like the outbreak of COVID-19, this paper provided a better way explaining how financial
market reflects the demand changes, especially the significant and long-lasting influence of
services sectors which is easily neglected by other researches.
The next section introduces the data selection and pre-processing. Section 3 discusses the
methodology. Section 4 presents the empirical study of the demand-oriented industry-specific
volatility spillover network analysis based on the SWS industry classification standard. Section 5
is the further discussion, and section 6 concludes.
2. Data
2.1 The study period
The study period is between January 3 and March 20, 2020. As early as December 27, 2019,
the local government of Wuhan began to report the patients of the pneumonia, which was
unidentifiable at that time, and took public health responses to the infection. As of January 20,
2020, Chinese government began to implement nationwide containment of the COVID-19. On
January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 a public health
emergency of international concern (PHEIC). To guarantee that all patients can be treated, Chinese
government covered all bills of the pharmaceutical treatment with the budgets. Besides, to reduce
the size of the pandemic, multiple NPIs were used by Chinese government as well including the
inter-city travel restrictions, the early identification and isolation of the suspected ill persons and
the contact restrictions measures [44]. As the result, the outbreak was preliminarily contained in
China at the end of February. Since March 18, 2020, the number of new patients were maintaining
lower than 10 per day. However, COVID-19 began to breakout outside China. On February 29,
2020, the WHO increased the assessment of the risk of spread to “very high” at global level.
Taking into account the size of spread and the progress of containing of the COVID-19 both
inside and outside China, we divided the study period into three sub-periods. The period 1 is
between January 3 and January 23, 2020. The period 2 is between February 3 and February 28,
2020. The period 3 is between March 2 and March 20. Period 1, 2 and 3 has 16, 20 and 15trading
days, respectively.
2.2 The industry classification standard
Industry classification is a long-standing problem in financial research [32]. There are two
kinds of industry classification standards, the administrating-oriented standards and the
investing-oriented ones. Administrating-oriented standards define the categories mainly according
to the companies’ production technology. This kind of standards is issued by governments or
market supervisors for purpose of supervising the companies by industry categories. In contrast,
investing-oriented standards not only pay attention to the production technology, but also highlight
the kind of market demand met by the company. This kind of standards is made to meet the need
of the investment professionals.
5

The typical administrating-oriented standards consist of the International Standard Industrial
Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) and North American Industry Classification
System (NAICS). The popular investing-oriented ones consist of the Global Industry
Classification Standard (GICS) and FTSE Global Classification System. In China’s financial
market, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued an administrating-oriented standard
called the Guideline for Industry Classification of China’s Listed Companies in 2012. Besides,
Chinese Securities Index Co., Ltd. and SWS Securities Co., Ltd established two different
investment-oriented industry classification standards, which are the CIS standard and SWS
standard, respectively.
The industry securities indices traded in the exchanges are always made according to one of
the investing-oriented standards. Among the investing-oriented standards used in China’ financial
market, the CSI standard is the one closest with the GICS standard. This standard is therefore the
most popular one chosen for the spillover networks analysis of China’s stock market. However,
the categories representing consumption and investment are unbalanced according to the CSI
standard. Consuming goods firms are classified as two sectors (level 1 categories), consumer
stable and consumer discretionary, while capital goods ones is only an industry group (level 2
category). Thus, we chose the SWS standard as the industry classification standard. According to
SWS standard, the securities in China’s stock market are divided into 28 sectors, which are further
divided into 104 industry groups. As shown in Table 1, the most significant difference from the
CSI standard is that SWS standard integrated the sectors into four demand-oriented sector groups.

Note: 1. The conglomerates sector consists of listed companies with diversified businesses in
which no single business is dominant. Although as a sector vertex in the sector-specific spillover
network, SWI conglomerates sector index is belong to none of the sector groups.
2. The codes of industry group indexes (level 2 categories of industry classification system)
consists of 6 digits in which the first 2 digits are “80-”
Table source: Wind Financial database
As a supplement of Table 1, we listed the names and the codes of all industry group indices
according to SWS standard. In addition, because the level 3 categories (industry) was not
mentioned in this paper, we will call the “industry group securities index” as “industry securities
index” for short in the following sections.
2.3 The data pre-processing and descriptive statistics
The minute-per-minute data of the close prices of 102 SWS industry securities indices are
available in the Wind Financial Database. By convention, we calculate the log-return of the 𝑃𝑖,𝑡 ,
which is the price of the index i at the moment t, as 𝑟𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑙𝑛(𝑃𝑖,𝑡 ) − 𝑙𝑛(𝑃𝑖,𝑡−1 ). Then we
obtain 𝑟𝑖 = {𝑟𝑖,𝑡 }, 𝑡 ∈ *1,2, ⋯ , 𝑇+ as the log-return series of the index i. The comprehensive
descriptive statistics the log-return series of all industry securities indices in different periods can
be found in appendix. In the body of text, we only displayed the distributions of the means and
variances of the indices’ log-returns in different period in Figure 1.

3. Methodology
3.1 The GARCH-BEKK based volatility spillover network
GARCH-BEKK model is purposed by [46] 46. The economic implication of the model is
attracting because its parameters are able to detect the spillover effect between the variables.
Consider time series 𝑟𝑖 = {𝑟𝑖,𝑡 }, 𝑡 ∈ *1,2, ⋯ , 𝑇+ and 𝑟𝑗 = {𝑟𝑗,𝑡 }, 𝑡 ∈ *1,2, ⋯ , 𝑇+ , to test the
spillover effect between them, a bi-variable GARCH-BEKK model is required. The bi-variable
GARCH-BEKK model consists of a mean equation and a variance equation. According to
literature [47, 48] 4748, the lag order of both equations can be set as 1. The mean equation of
bi-variable GARCH-BEKK model is showed in equation (1):
𝑟𝑖,𝑡
𝜇𝑖
𝜀𝑖,𝑡
𝜑𝑖𝑖 𝜑𝑖𝑗 𝑟𝑖,𝑡−1
[𝑟 ] = [𝜇 ] + [𝜑
] [𝑟
] + [𝜀 ]
(1)

𝑗,𝑡−1
𝑗,𝑡
where 𝜇𝑖 , 𝜇𝑗 , 𝜑𝑖𝑖 , 𝜑𝑖𝑗 , 𝜑𝑗𝑖 and 𝜑𝑗𝑗 are parameters to be estimated, the 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 and 𝜀𝑗,𝑡 are residuals.
They are also called innovations, which represent the influence of the new information generated
at moment 𝑡.
The variance model is as equation (2):
𝐻𝑡 = 𝐶 ′ 𝐶 + A′ 𝜀𝑡−1 𝜀 ′ 𝑡−1 𝐴 + 𝐵′ 𝐻𝑡−1 𝐵
(2)
𝜀𝑖,𝑡
𝐻𝑖𝑖,𝑡 𝐻𝑖𝑗,𝑡
where 𝐻𝑡 = [

𝑏𝑗𝑗

To detect the volatility spillovers between 𝑟𝑖 and 𝑟𝑗 , following hypothesizes are to be tested.
𝐻0 : 𝑎𝑖𝑗 = 𝑎𝑗𝑖 = 𝑏𝑖𝑗 = 𝑏𝑗𝑖 = 0
(3)
H1 : 𝑎𝑖𝑗 ≠ 0 𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑗𝑖 ≠ 0 𝑜𝑟 𝑏𝑖𝑗 ≠ 0 𝑜𝑟 𝑏𝑗𝑖 ≠ 0
(4)
in which 𝐻0 is the null hypothesis and 𝐻1is the alternative hypothesis. By convention, we reject
null hypothesis at 90% confidence level. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it means that there are
spillovers between 𝑟𝑖 and 𝑟𝑗 . Specifically, the direction of spillover effect is from 𝑟𝑖 to 𝑟𝑗 when
𝑎𝑖𝑗 ≠ 0 or 𝑏𝑖𝑗 ≠ 0. Otherwise, the direction is from 𝑟𝑗 to 𝑟𝑖 when 𝑎𝑗𝑖 ≠ 0 or 𝑏𝑗𝑖 ≠ 0.
To test volatility spillovers between multiple variables, a set of bi-variable GARCH-BEKK
models are required. After all testing finished, we can identify the GARCH-BEKK based volatility
spillover networks. Let 𝑁𝑒𝑡(𝑉, 𝐸) represents the industry-specific securities indices volatility
spillover networks. The set 𝑉 = *𝑣1 , 𝑣2 , ⋯ , 𝑣𝑁 + represents the vertices, which are called nodes
as well, of industry securities indices. Each of the nodes 𝑣𝑖 is characterized by a log-return time
8

series 𝑟𝑖 . The set 𝐸 represents the edges of networks. For ∀𝑣𝑖 , 𝑣𝑗 ∈ 𝑉, the edges from 𝑣𝑖 to 𝑣𝑗
satisfy the indicator function 𝑒𝑖𝑗 as follows:
1 𝑖𝑓 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑡𝑕𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑖𝑠 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚 𝑟𝑖 𝑡𝑜 𝑟𝑗
𝑒𝑖𝑗 = {
0 𝑜𝑡𝑕𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒
Now consider the weight of 𝑒𝑖𝑗 . By reference to literatures [49, 50]

(5)
4950

, we calculated the

weight of edges as follows

where the weights of 𝑒𝑖𝑗 and 𝑒𝑗𝑖

𝑤𝑖𝑗 = |𝑎𝑖𝑗 | + |𝑏𝑖𝑗 |
(6)
𝑤𝑗𝑖 = |𝑎𝑗𝑖 | + |𝑏𝑗𝑖 |
(7)
are represented 𝑤𝑖𝑗 and 𝑤𝑗𝑖 , respectively. Now the weighted

and directed GARCH-BEKK based volatility spillover networks have been identified. The
intensity of the edge 𝑒𝑖𝑗 can be calculated as 𝑠𝑖𝑗 = 𝑒𝑖𝑗 𝑤𝑖𝑗
3.2 The nodes’ importance ranking indicators
3.2.1 The indicators at node level
1. Connectivity and relative influence
The connectivity indicators consist of the 𝑂𝑖 and 𝐼𝑖 , which represent the total intensity of
outward spillovers from 𝑣𝑖 and the total intensity of inward spillovers to 𝑣𝑖 , respectively. 𝑂𝑖
and 𝐼𝑖 are calculated as:
𝑁

𝑂𝑖 = ∑ 𝑠𝑖𝑗

𝑁

𝐼𝑖 = ∑ 𝑠𝑗𝑖

(8)

𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝑖

(9)

𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝑖

Both 𝑂𝑖 and 𝐼𝑖 are absolute indicators. The relative influence of 𝑣𝑖 is calculated as:
𝑂𝑖 − 𝐼𝑖
, 𝑜𝑡𝑕𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒
𝑟𝑖𝑖 = {𝑂𝑖 + 𝐼𝑖
0 , 𝑖𝑓 𝑂𝑖 + 𝐼𝑖 = 0

(10)

2. Weighted k-shell decomposition
Besides the number of neighbors, the location of a node in the network is also critical for the
assessment of its importance. Literature [51] therefore purposed the k-shell decomposition to
evaluate the locational importance of the nodes. 51 The k-shell decomposition is the method that
reshapes the networks into a layered structure according to their connectivity patterns. For an
un-weighted network N0 = 𝑁𝑒𝑡(𝑉0 , E0 ), the layer 𝐿 of 𝑁0 is a subset of nodes, each of which
has only one neighbor. We assign the layer an integer label 𝐿1 and remove it from the 𝑁0 . Then
we obtain a new network N1 = 𝑁𝑒𝑡(𝑉1 , E1 ). Similarly, we identify the layer of the network 𝑁𝑛−1,
assign the layer a label 𝐿𝑛 and remove it from the network. After repeating the step for 𝐾 times,
each of the nodes in the original network N0 can be assigned to one of the layers. The k-shell
decomposition is a coarse-grained ranking method. The nodes belonging to the layer with label
𝐿1 are those with the lowest locational importance in the networks. Relatively, the nodes
belonging to the layer 𝐿𝐾 are those with the highest locational importance. in another word, they
are the center of the network.
The vanilla k-shell decomposition fails to consider the intensity of connections. Thus, it
cannot rank the nodes for weighted networks. The literature [52] 52extended the vanilla k-shell
decomposition to weighted k-shell decomposition. An alternative measure for node degree is
purposed in [52], which is shown in equation (11).

𝛽

𝑤𝑘𝑖 = ,𝑘𝑖𝛼 𝑂𝑖 -𝛼+𝛽

(11)

where 𝑘𝑖 represents the number of neighbors connected with 𝑣𝑖 , 𝑂𝑖 is defined in equation (8).
According to [52], the parameters can be set as 𝛼 = 𝛽 = 1. Note that 𝑤𝑘𝑖 is not integer value.
Therefore, we should firstly divide all the weights of edges in N0 with their minimum value, and
discretize the resulting weights by rounding to their closest integer. Then we
get N0′ = 𝑁𝑒𝑡(𝑉0 , E0′ ), in which the minimum value of the weights equals to 1. Each step of the
weighted k-shell decomposition consists of: first, normalize Nn to Nn′ , second, identify the layer
𝑘 = 𝑛 + 1 and third, remove the layer from Nn and obtain the Nn+1.
3. Betweenness centrality
The betweenness centrality is based on the shortest distances between the nodes. For
weighted directed networks, the definition of the shortest distance from 𝑣𝑖 to 𝑣𝑗 is shown in
equation (12)

53

= min*(𝑠𝑖𝑑
+ 𝑠𝑑−𝛼
+ ⋯ + 𝑠𝑑−𝛼
), 𝑠𝑖𝑗

𝑘𝑗
𝐷𝑖𝑗

(12)

where 𝐷𝑖𝑗 = {𝑣𝑑1 𝑣𝑑2 , ⋯ , 𝑣𝑑𝑘 }, 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑁 − 2 represents a set of arbitrary intermediate nodes of
the spillover paths from 𝑣𝑖 to 𝑣𝑗 . The set of the intermediate nodes of the shortest path can be
𝛼
−𝛼
therefore defined as 𝐷𝑖𝑗∗ . If 𝑑𝑖𝑗
= 𝑠𝑖𝑗
, there are no intermediate nodes in the shortest path from 𝑣𝑖
∗
to 𝑣𝑗 , and 𝐷𝑖𝑗 = ∅ [53]. For unweighted networks, the parameter 𝛼 simply equals to zero. For
weighted networks, the value of 𝛼 depends on the relationship between the link intensity between
the nodes and their distance. In the weighted and directed spillover networks of financial markets,
firstly, the higher link intensity between the nodes means the shorter distance. The value of 𝛼
should be positive. Secondly, if there are more intermediate nodes in the spillover path between
two nodes, their distance is longer. The 𝛼 is supposed to be less than 1. With a comprehensive
consideration, we take 𝛼 = 0.5.
We can easily define the betweenness and the closeness based on the definition of the shortest
𝛼
distance 𝑑𝑖𝑗
. The weighted betweenness centrality of 𝑣𝑖 , 𝑊𝐵𝐶𝑖 , represents the proportion of
shortest paths from 𝑣𝑗 to 𝑣𝑘 , which include 𝑣𝑖 as an intermediate node. The 𝑊𝐵𝐶𝑖 can be
calculated by equation (13).
𝑊𝐵𝐶𝑖 = ∑
𝑖≠𝑗≠𝑘

𝑔𝑗𝑘 (𝑖)
𝑔𝑗𝑘

(13)

∗
∗
where 𝑔𝑗𝑘 is the number of different 𝐷𝑗𝑘
, 𝑔𝑗𝑘 (𝑖) is the number of 𝐷𝑗𝑘
including 𝑣𝑖 as an

intermediate node.
3.2.2 The indicators at group level
When dividing the nodes into several groups, additional indictors are required for assessing
the importance of the groups according to [10, 54]54
1. Group-specific connectivity
The outward spillover effect from the noes in one group to those in other groups can be
defined as “total out to other” (TOTO). Similarly, the inward spillover to one group from other
groups can be defined as “total in from other” (TIFO). The TOTO and TIFO are showed in
equation (14) and equation (15):

10

𝑁−𝑁𝑚

𝑇𝑂𝑇𝑂𝑖 = ∑ 𝑠𝑖𝑗 , 𝑣𝑗 ∈ 𝑉 ∖ 𝑉𝑚

(14)

𝑗=1
𝑁−𝑁𝑚

𝑇𝐼𝐹𝑂𝑖 = ∑ 𝑠𝑗𝑖 , 𝑣𝑗 ∈ 𝑉 ∖ 𝑉𝑚

(15)

𝑗=1

where 𝑣𝑖 belongs to the subset 𝑉𝑚 = *𝑣𝑖 |𝑖 ∈ 𝑚+ which includes 𝑁𝑚 nodes.
2. Sector influence
Let 𝑉𝑚 , 𝑉𝑛 ⊂ 𝑉 which satisfies 𝑉𝑚 = *𝑣𝑖 |𝑖 ∈ 𝑚+ and 𝑉𝑛 = {𝑣𝑗 |𝑗 ∈ 𝑛}. We calculate the
sector influence indicator as follows:
𝑆𝐼𝑚𝑛 =

1
∑ ∑ 𝑠𝑖𝑗
𝑁𝑚 𝑁𝑛

(16)

𝑖∈𝑚 𝑗∈𝑛

The higher the 𝑆𝐼𝑚𝑛 is, the more intensive the spillover is from the subset 𝑉𝑚 to the subset 𝑉𝑛 .
3.3 Earth mover’s distance (EMD)
None of the indicators introduced in section 2.2 highlight measuring the distributional change
in the spillover intensity. Therefore, we introduce the earth mover’s distance（EMD）to consider
the intensity distributions change in spillovers across different groups. The EMD 55 is a cross-bin
distance that is defined as the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one histogram into the
other. An intensity distribution of spillovers can be represented by countable clusters. Each cluster
is represented by its mean, and by the fraction of the distribution that belongs to that cluster. We
call such a representation the signature of the distribution. Then the distributional change in
spillovers intensity between period 1 and period 2 can be formalized and solved as a transportation
problem. We transform the distribution of link strength in period 1 and period 2 into signatures 𝒮1
and 𝒮2 .
𝒮1 = {(𝑆11 , 𝑝𝑆11 ), (𝑆12 , 𝑝𝑆12 ), ⋯ , (𝑆1𝑚 , 𝑝𝑆1𝑚 )}
{
(17)
𝒮2 = {(𝑆21 , 𝑝𝑆21 ), (𝑆22 , 𝑝𝑆22 ), ⋯ , (𝑆2𝑛 , 𝑝𝑆2𝑛 )}
where the intensity distribution of the spillovers in period 1 and period 2 are discretized into 𝑚
and 𝑛 clusters. The 𝑆1𝑖 and 𝑆2𝑗 represent the means of the 𝑖𝑡𝑕 cluster in period 1 and the 𝑗𝑡𝑕
one in period 2, respectively. Both 𝑆1𝑖 and 𝑆2𝑗 are one dimensional real value, we define the
ground distance between 𝑖𝑡𝑕 cluster in period 1 and the 𝑗𝑡𝑕 one in period 2 as dij = |𝑆1𝑖 − 𝑆2𝑗 |.
The 𝑝𝑥 represents the weight of cluster 𝑥 . Besides, the 𝑝𝑥 naturally satisfies ∑𝑚
𝑖=1 𝑝𝑆1𝑖 =
𝑛
∑𝑗=1 𝑝𝑆2𝑗 = 1.
We want a flow 𝐹 = [𝑓𝑖𝑗 ]𝑚×𝑛 with positive 𝑓𝑖𝑗 from 𝑆1𝑖 to 𝑆2𝑗 that minimizes the
transporting cost

4. The demand-oriented industry-specific volatility spillover networks analysis
4.1 The network before the CoVID-19 outbreak
Table 2 reports the summary of the nodes in period 1 by group. According to Panel A, before
the breakout of COVID-19, the sector group Kg is a significant volatility supplier in the network.
The median of 𝑂𝑖 and that of 𝑇𝑂𝑇𝑂𝑖 of the nodes in the group Kg are 6.71 and 5.39, much
higher than other group counterparts. The indicator ∑ 𝑇𝑂𝑇𝑂⁄∑ 𝑂 measures the proportion that
outward spillovers from one sector group to accounts for in its total spillovers. The group
unclassified services (Us) has the highest value of ∑ 𝑇𝑂𝑇𝑂⁄∑ 𝑂 , which is 78.55%.
According to Panel B, the median of 𝐼𝑖 and that of 𝑇𝐼𝐹𝑂𝑖 of the group equipment
manufacturing (Ke) is 5.67 and 4.48. Meanwhile, the value of ∑ 𝑇𝐼𝐹𝑂 ⁄∑ 𝐼 of this group is also
the highest, which is 78.58% in its total 𝐼𝑖 .
Panel C showed that group Kg is the only one with a positive median of 𝑟𝑖𝑖 (0.09). Those of
other three groups are all negative values in which the lowest one is the median of 𝑟𝑖𝑖 of the
group Cg (-0.15). The median of 𝑊𝐵𝐶𝑖 of the group Kg is 39, which is also much higher than
other group counterparts are. The median of 𝑊𝐵𝐶𝑖 of the group Us is 16, which is the lowest. It
means that many strong and critical spillover paths go through the group Kg while few of them go
through the group Us.

Note: Ke, Cg, Kg and Us are the abbreviations of the sector groups of equipment manufacturing,
consumption goods, capital goods and unclassified services, both here and below.
Table 3 reported the inter-group spillovers of the network in period 1. We can find the
significant asymmetry in the spillover between the group Kg and Cg. Both the gross and net
spillovers from Kg to Cg are all the highest, which are 49.02 and 16.22. Besides, the net spillover
from Kg to Ke is 14.8. All of the rest of inter-group spillovers are lower than 10. Relatively, there
are only slight asymmetry in the spillovers between other sector groups, except that between Kg
and Cg. The net spillover from Cg to Ke is much weaker than that from Kg to Cg. Thus, viewing
the group Kg and Ke as integral whole sector group meeting the investment demand, it has net
spillover to the group Cg.
In period 1, the group Kg is the main contributor of spillovers from all aspects. The outward
spillovers from Kg to other groups account for 23.2% in the total spillovers in the network. In
contrast, the Cg plays the role of main receiver of spillovers, which receives 22.3% of the total
spillovers. The group Ke also receives 20.3%, a proportion only slightly lower than that of Cg, of
the total spillover effects. In addition, all other three groups have net spillovers to the group Ke.

4.2 The network at the beginning of the CoVID-19 outbreak
Table 4 reports the summary of the nodes in period 2 by group. According to Panel A, the
median of 𝑂𝑖 and that of 𝑇𝑂𝑇𝑂𝑖 of the group Kg is 8.81 and 6.39, which are even higher than
those in period 1. The group Kg also has the highest value of ∑ 𝑇𝑂𝑇𝑂⁄∑ 𝑂 , which is 76.21%.
The median of 𝑂𝑖 and that of 𝑇𝑂𝑇𝑂𝑖 of group Us is 6.15 and 4.46, which increase the most
significantly comparing to those in period 1.
According to Panel B, the median of 𝐼𝑖 and that of 𝑇𝐼𝐹𝑂𝑖 of group Ke are the highest,
which are 8.81 and 6.39. The median of 𝐼𝑖 and that of 𝑇𝐼𝐹𝑂𝑖 of group Cg is 5.58 and 4.65.
Meanwhile, the value of ∑ 𝑇𝐼𝐹𝑂⁄∑ 𝐼 of this group is also the highest, which exceeds 80%.
According to Panel C, the highest median of 𝑟𝑖𝑖 is that of group Kg, which is 0.2. The
lowest one is that of the group Cg, which is -0.31. In period 2, the difference of 𝑟𝑖𝑖 among sector
groups enlarge compared with that in period 1. The median of 𝑊𝐵𝐶𝑖 of the group Kg is 33,
which is still the highest. However, the median of 𝑊𝐵𝐶𝑖 of the group Us is 27, which increases
rapidly. It means the centrality of nodes in the group Us become much higher.

Table 5 reports the inter-group spillovers of the network in period 2. We can firstly find that
both the total spillover intensity and the number of spillover paths in period 2 are significantly
higher than those in period 1. It means that the outbreak of COVID-19 intensified the overall
spillovers in China’s stock market. The gross and net outward spillovers from Kg to Cg are 61.37
and 36.32, which account for higher proportion in total spillovers than those in period 1.
Specifically, the proportion of the gross spillover from Kg to Cg increases from 9.1% to 9.5% of
the total spillovers of the network. The proportion of the net spillover increases even more rapidly
from 3.0% to 5.6%. Besides, the group Ke and Kg, as an integral whole, still has net spillover
effect to the group Cg.
In period 2, the outward spillovers from Kg to other groups account for 24.0% of the total
spillovers of the network. The group Cg receives 24.3% of the total spillovers. In addition, all
other three groups have net outward spillovers to the group Cg, including the group Ke. Therefore,
the Kg and Cg can be viewed as the major contributor and the receiver of the spillovers in period
2.

4.3 The group-specific spillover network in the second month after the CoVID-19
outbreak
Table 6 reports the summary of the nodes in period 3 by group. According to Panel A, the
sector group with the highest outward spillover effect in period 3 is the group Us, rather than the
Kg in period 1 and period 2. The median of 𝑂𝑖 and that of 𝑇𝑂𝑇𝑂𝑖 of group Us are 5.37 and 4.43.
The group Us also has the highest ∑ 𝑇𝑂𝑇𝑂⁄∑ 𝑂 value, which is 76.21%.
According to Panel B, the median of 𝐼𝑖 of group Us is the highest, which is 5.76. However,
the ∑ 𝑇𝐼𝐹𝑂⁄∑ 𝐼 value of group Us is not relatively high. It reveals that in period 3, the
intra-group spillovers between the nodes in the group Us increase significantly. The group Ke still
has the highest median of 𝑇𝐼𝐹𝑂𝑖 (4.18). Moreover, the ∑ 𝑇𝐼𝐹𝑂⁄∑ 𝐼 value of group Ke is
78.41%.
According to Panel C, the group Kg has the highest median of 𝑟𝑖𝑖 (0.05), which is still the
only positive value. The lowest one belongs to the group Cg, which is -0.18. In period 3, the gap
of 𝑟𝑖𝑖 between different sector groups is closer than that in period 2. The group Us, instead of
group Kg, becomes the group with the highest median of 𝑊𝐵𝐶𝑖 , the value of which is 28. Besides,
the median of 𝑊𝐵𝐶𝑖 of group Kg is 27, which is only slightly lower than that of the group Us.

Table 7 reports the inter-group spillovers of the network in period 3. Both the total spillover
intensity and the number of spillover paths in period 3 are less than those in period 2. The most
15

significant difference between the inter-group spillovers in period 3 and those in period 1 and
period 2 is that net outward spillover effect from the group Us to the group Kg occurs. The group
Us therefore becomes the group that has net outward spillovers to all other three groups. Besides,
the group Ke and Kg, as an integral whole, still has net spillover effect to the group Cg.
In period 3, the outward spillovers from the group Us account for 20.4% in the total
spillovers of the network. The inward spillovers to the group Cg account for 21.9% of the total
spillovers. Therefore, the Us and Cg can be viewed as the major contributor and the receiver of the
spillovers in period 3.

In conclusion, there are both stable patterns and significant changes in the demand-oriented
industry-specific volatility spillover networks of China’s stock market during the study period.
Firstly, viewing the sector group Kg and Ke as an integral whole, they always have significant net
spillovers to the group Cg. Such spillovers are relatively stronger in period 2 than in other two
periods. Secondly, the group Kg always has the net outward spillover to the group Ke. More
important, the importance of the group Us increasingly rises, and finally becomes the major
contributor of the spillovers in period 3. Figure 2 depicts the simplified spillover paths of networks
in different periods by sector groups.

Note: the size of each node represents the total spillover effects from this sector group to others.
The width and direction of each arrow represent the strength and direction of net spillover effect
between the relevant pair of sector groups, respectively. The black arrows in each subfigure
represent the major paths in each period obtained through maximum spawning tree method.
Figure 2: The demand-oriented industry-specific volatility spillover networks in different
periods (net effect by sector groups)
According to figure 2, the spillover paths from Kg to Cg and Ke are stable in all periods.
The breakout of COVID-19 leads to an increasingly rise of importance of the spillover paths from
the group Us to other ones. Especially, the path from Us to Cg becomes one of the major paths of
the spillover networks of China's stock market after the breakout of COVID-19.

The findings of this section have inspiring economic implications. Firstly, some literatures
like [56, 57] proved that fluctuation in investment demand caused by exogenous is the main cause
of the fluctuation in China’s economic demand. Our numerical findings further show that the
structural change of volatility spillover networks of China’s stock market can reflect the critical
role that investment demand plays in the fluctuation in China's economic demand after the
outbreak of COVID-19. On the one hand, the group Kg and Ke, as an integral whole, are the
stable spillover contributors to the group Cg in the networks. On the other hand, the outward
spillover effect from the groups Kg and Ke to the group Cg rapidly rose at the beginning of the
COVID-19 outbreak.
After the outbreak was preliminarily contained, these spillovers
significantly fell. One of the main damage caused by COVID-19 is the nationwide closure and
idling of plants in all trades, which undisputedly has huge impact on the investment demand in
China. The highly increased uncertainty of investment demand leads to the fluctuation in stock
prices of securities in the industry sectors, which supply goods or services meeting the investment
demand. Therefore, what is showed concerning the change in spillovers from the sector groups Ke
and Kg to the group Cg provides the empirical evidence, from the perspective of financial market,
for the economics theories purposed by [56, 57]. 5657
Secondly, the increasingly rising importance of the sector group Us in the spillover networks
reveals the occurrence of supply restriction on service industry caused by the implementing of
NPIs. For containing COVID-19, Chinese government implemented immediate NPIs nationwide.
The majority part of the service places are forced to a termless shutting down. A large percentage
of transportation services in China have to idle, despite for the huge freight and passenger traffic
demands. The uncertainty of COVID-19 therefore transforms into the uncertainty of the operation
environment of the companies of services sectors and then their asset prices. According to [58, 59],
the service supply restriction will lead to the imbalance between supply and demand and retard
economic growth. As the result, the companies of service sectors contribute more volatility
spillovers to those of other sectors. When the overseas market demand is strong, a country is still
able to achieve a high economic growth under the condition of service supply restriction. However,
once the overseas market demand becomes insufficient, the service supply restriction will have
serious damage to the economy. As introduced in section 2.1, the COVID-19 began to spread
outside China in period 3. As a global pandemic, the COVID-19 will surely leads to the
insufficiency of overseas demand of Chinese products. As the result, the importance of the group
Us in the networks in period 3 is even higher than in period 2. In addition, according to [61], to
compare with the period in which developed countries were at the similar stage of development as
current China, there is severe supply restriction on most of service industries nowadays in China.
Service supply restriction is an overall problem rather than a structural one in Chinese economy.
The outbreak of COVID-19 is only an exogenous shock that intensified the problem. Therefore,
we believe that our finding is still representative although not all service industry sectors are
classified as members in the group Us according to the SWS standard. 58596061
5. The further discussions
We further discuss the demand-oriented industry-specific volatility spillover networks of
China's stock market in three aspects. First, we calculate the EMD of the distributions of the
spillover intensity both inter- and intra- sector groups in different periods. Second, defining the
major spillover paths as those with the top 20% highest intensity among a set of paths, we discuss
17

the major spillover paths between different sector groups and their changes in different periods.
Third, from various perspectives, we select the systemically important nodes of the networks in
different periods.
5.1 The EMDs between spillover intensity distributions in different periods
Figure 3 depicts the intensity distributions of spillovers between sector groups in three
periods. We can intuitively find that all of the intensity distributions of spillovers, both inter- and
intra-sector groups, are right-skewed. Only few spillover paths have high intensity. In most of the
subfigures, the intensity distribution of spillovers in period 1 is similar to that in period 3. The
intensity distribution in period 2, in contrast, is significantly different from the counterparts in
period 1 and of period 3. It reveals that in period 2, the industry-specific volatility spillover
network of China’s stock market has significantly structural changes. As an exception, the
intensity distribution of spillover paths intra-group Us and of spillover paths between the group Us
and Cg in period 2 are more similar to the distributions in period 3, rather than to the distributions
in period 1. The exception is also consistent with the findings in section 4 and proves that the
outbreak of COVID-19 has a more long-lasting impact on service sectors than on other ones.

18

Note: From subfigure (a) to subfigure (f), to distinguish between the spillover paths in one
direction to another, we do further processing with the data following the rule called “sector group
B=>sector group A: negative/positive: sector group A=>sector group B”. Take subfigure (a) for
example, if a spillover path is from one of industries belonging to Ke group (which is viewed as
group A) to one of those belonging to Cg group (which is viewed as group B), we take the original
value of its intensity. Otherwise, we take the opposite number of its intensity.
Figure 3 :The empirical probability density function of modified intensity of spillovers in
different periods
Table8 shows the EMDs between spillover intensity distributions in different periods.
Between period 1 and period 2, most of high EMDs are connected with the distribution changes in
spillovers between the group Us and other ones. Specifically, the EMD of the change in the
intensity distribution of spillovers from Ke to Us is 6.34%, those from Us to Ke and to Cg are 5.11%
and 4.38%, respectively. Between period 2 and period 3, most of high EMDs are connected with
the distribution changes in spillovers between the group Kg and other ones. Specifically, being
measured by the EMD, the intensity distribution of spillovers intra the group Kg changes in 4.43%.
The EMD of the change in the intensity distribution of spillovers from Kg to Us and those from
Cg to Kg are 4.31% and 3.71%, respectively.

The analysis in this section is a meaningful supplement for the analysis based on the sector
influence indicator in section 4. From period1 to period 2, the group Us is the sector group of
which the spillover effect strength distribution has the most significant change. It reveals that at
the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19, the nationwide implement of NPIs is reflected
immediately in the distributional characteristics of the spillover networks of China’s stock market.
The significant distributional change in the spillover strength concerning the group Kg from
period 2 to period 3, also shows that the risk for the investment demand destruction has been
controlled to some extent. This is mainly owing to the successful contained pandemic of
COVID-19 and the resumption of work that is strongly supported by both central and local
19

governments of China. It means that the influence of the pandemic on the investment demand fell
rapidly after the pandemic was contained in China, while the influence on the service sectors were
rather more long-lasting.
5.2 The major spillover paths
Considering the right-skewed intensity distributions of spillovers showed in section 5.1, the
spillover paths with high intensity are the minority but deserves further discussions. We define
spillover paths with the top 20% highest intensity from sector group A to sector group B as the
major spillover paths between these two groups. Figure 3 depicts the major spillover paths
between different sector groups in different periods.

indices belonging to the sector group Ke, Cg, Kg and Us, respectively. The industry securities
index name corresponding with each of the 4-digit codes in the figure can be found in Table 1.
Figure 3 The major spillover paths inter-sector-group in different periods
According to figure 3, the numbers of major spillover paths from the group Kg and Ke to
other groups increase from period 1 to period 2, while decrease from period 2 to period 3. The
number of major spillover paths from the group Cg, in contrast, decreases from period 1 to period
2, while increases from period 2 to period 3. The number of major spillover paths from the group
Us increases from period 1 to period 2. However, this number does not change significantly from
period 2 to period 3.
Specifically, according to subfigure (a) (b) and (c), in the sector group Ke, the electrical
21

equipment sector (1731, 1732, 1733 and 1734) is one of the critical contributors of the major
spillovers to other sector groups in the whole study period. According to subfigure (a) (d) and (e),
the major contributors of spillovers from sector group Cg vary depending on the periods. In period
1, the commercial trade sector (1202, 1203, 1204 and 1205), the apparel and textiles sector (1131,
1132) and the light manufacturing sector (1141, 1142 and 1143) have relatively large numbers of
major spillover paths to other sector groups. In period 2 and period 3, the commercial trade sector
still plays the main contributor of major spillover paths, while the spillovers from the other two
sectors become far less intensive than in period 1. Besides, the biochemical and pharmaceuticals
sector (indices from 1151 to 1156) becomes a new critical spillover contributor. According to
subfigure (b) (d) and (f), in period 1 the construction and decorations sector (1711, 1712 and 1713)
and building materials (1721, 1722, 1723, 1724 and 1725) contribute most of major spillover
paths to other sector groups. However, various sectors of mining and raw material processing
become more critical spillover contributors in period 2 and period 3. According to subfigure (c) (e)
and (f), in period 1, the number of major spillover paths from utilities sector (indices from 1161 to
1164) and transporting sector (indices from 1171 to 1178) account for the largest proportion of all
major spillover paths from the group Us to other sector groups. The numbers of major spillover
paths from the information services sector (1222, 1223) and the media sector (1751, 1752 and
1761) increase in period 2. The number of major spillover paths from the finance sector increases
in period 3.

indices belonging to the sector group Ke, Cg, Kg and Us, respectively. The industry securities
index name corresponding with each of the 4-digit codes in the figure can be found in appendix.
Figure 4 The major spillover paths intra-sector-group in different periods
According to figure 4, the numbers of major spillover paths intra the group Kg and intra the
group Ke increase from period 1 to period 2, while decrease from period 2 to period 3. The
number of major spillover paths intra the group Cg, in contrast, decreases from period 1 to period
2, while increases from period 2 to period 3. The number of major spillover paths intra the group
Us does not change significantly during the whole study period.
Specifically, according to subfigure (a), there are large number of major spillover paths
between the transportation equipment sector (1092, 1093, 1094 and 1881), the machinery sector
(from 1072 to 1076) and the electronic components sector (from 1081 to 1085). There a great
number of major spillover paths intra the group Ke received by the electrical equipment sector
during the whole study period. This number is especially great in period 2. According to subfigure
(b), in the sector group Cg, the apparel and textiles sector and the light manufacturing sector
contribute a great number of major spillover paths to the commercial trade sector, the agricultural
sector (from 1011 to 1018) and the biochemical and pharmaceuticals sector in period 1. After
period 2, the major spillovers received by agricultural sector significantly increases, while the
numbers of those received by the commercial trade sector and the biochemical and
pharmaceuticals sector decrease. According to subfigure (c), in the sector group Kg, the mining
sector and the raw material processing sectors have a number of major spillover paths to the
construction sectors. In addition, the number of major spillover paths from the mining sector and
23

the raw material processing sectors to the construction sectors increases in to period 2, while
decreases in period 3. According to subfigure (d), in sector group Us, the number of major
spillover paths from the transportation service sector and the utilities sector to other sectors are
great, and it is even greater in period 2 than in period 1 or period 3. Moreover, the finance sector
has more major spillover paths to other sectors in group Us after period 2.
5.3 The systematically important nodes in spillover network
The structure of the volatility spillover networks of China’s stock market is asymmetric in the
study period.

(a) the outward connectivity of the nodes

(b) the inward connectivity of the nodes
Note: The blue, green, purple and oranges nodes represent vertices of industry indices belonging
to the sector group Ke, Cg, Kg and Us, respectively. The conglomerates industry securities index
(801231) is represented by a grey node.
Figure 5 The distributions of the nodes’ connectivity intensity in different periods
According to figure 5, although the exact distribution of the nodes’ connectivity intensity
cannot be examined, we can still find that the several nodes with the highest connectivity intensity
play the dominated role in the spillover networks. Thus, we further select the systematical
important nodes in the volatility spillover networks in different periods from various perspectives.
Firstly, according to Figure 6 (a), nodes in the commerce and trading sector (1202 and 1203),
the construction sector (1721, 1723 and 1724), the utility sector (1161) and the transportation
services sector (1175 and 1178) can be viewed as the main contributors of the spillovers in all
periods. Comparing to the network in period 1, in the spillover network in period 2, there are more
nodes in the group Ke and in the group Us that become the main contributors of spillover effects,
while less nodes in the group Cg that keep playing the role of main contributors. Comparing to the
network in period 2, in the spillover network in period 3, there are more nodes in the group Cg and
24

in group Us that become the main contributors of spillovers, while less nodes in group Ke and in
group Kg that keep playing the role of main contributors.
According to figure 6(b), a list of nodes in sector group Cg (1014, 1017, 1111, 1112, 1212,
1123, 1141, 1143 and 1156) and in the group Us (1171, 1176, 1123, 1223 and 1752) are the main
receivers of spillovers in the networks during the whole study period. After period 2, more nodes
in sector group Kg (1712, 1037 and 1053) and in the group Ke (1731, 1732, 1733, 1101 and 1084)
become the main receivers. Based on figure 7, figure 6 further provides the visualization of the
relative spillovers of the nodes according to their relative influence indicators.
According to figure 8, comparing to the network in period 1, in the network in period 2, there
are more nodes in the group Kg and Ke that have the relatively higher betweenness centrality and
k-shell level. However, in the network in period 3, there are more nodes in group Us that have the
relatively higher betweenness centrality and k-shell level.
In conclusion, the analysis in section 5 further validates the main result of section 4. The
spillovers from sector groups Kg and Ke, as an integral whole, rise in period2, while fall in period
3. The change in the spillovers from the group Cg is in contrast. For the opinion of the spillovers
from sectors meeting the consumption demand to other sectors in China's stock market, our
findings are consistent with literature [45] (in Chinese). Both the literature [45] and this paper are
early reports of the industry-specific volatility spillover networks of china's stock market around
the outbreak of COVID-19. Comparing to [45], however, we select the SWS standard, rather than
the CSI standard, to identify the networks. The relationship between the sectors meeting the
investment and consumption demand therefore can be further detected. as the result, we can
illustrate how spillover networks of China’s stock market reflect the relative rise and fall of the
uncertainty of the investment demand and consumption demand in China during the spread of
COVID-19. Literature [45] also purposed the proposition that the services industries suffering
from the COVID-19 is a potential threat of the economy recovery in China. Besides, literature [42]
found that more difficulties would be faced by industry sectors relying on transportation services
in the economy recovery. Basing on the spillover networks of stock market, our findings provide
evidence for these literatures.
6. Conclusion
To illustrate how spillover networks of stock market reflect the change in demand, we
identified the GARCH-BEKK based demand-oriented industry-specific volatility spillover
networks of China’s stock market by dividing 102 SWS securities indices into four
demand-oriented sector groups. We divided the study period into three different sub-periods.
Period 1, 2 and 3 represent the period before the nationwide outbreak of COVID-19 in China, the
period at the beginning of the outbreak and the one after the disease was preliminarily contained.
According to our empirical analysis, firstly, the sector groups Ke and Kg, as a whole, have
stable net spillovers to the sector group Cg during the whole study period. Secondly, the net
spillovers from the group Ke and Kg to the group Cg rose in period 2, while fell in period 3.
Thirdly, as of period 2, the importance of the sector group Us became increasingly higher. The
group Us finally played the main contributor of the spillover network of China’s stock market in
period 3. We did further discussions from various perspectives. All discussions did a joint
validation for our main result.
We emphasize discussing the demand change in a country. Our findings also have meaningful
inspirations about economy recovery in the context of containing the spread of COVID-19. The
25

investment demand in China suffered more than the consumption demand did from the exogenous
shock of the COVID-19 at the beginning of outbreaks of this disease. However, when the
pandemic was contained, the risk in investment demand in China was also controlled to some
extent. On the one hand, fluctuation in investment demand caused by exogenous shocks is the
main reason of the uncertainty of economy in one country. It is therefore consistent with the
economics theories that the sector groups meeting the investment demand dominate the spillover
network of China’s stock market at the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19. On the other
hand, because Chinese government successfully contained the pandemic and organized the work
resumption with high efficiency, the risk of investment demand was controlled and eliminated
relatively fast. The trend of risk eliminating is also reflected in the structural change of the
spillover networks between period 2 and period 3.
The sector group US began to play critical role in the spillover network as of the nationwide
implement of NPIs. The importance of the sector group Us rose even higher when the COVID-19
deteriorated out of China. It reveals that the supply restriction in services is still a long-lasting
threat for the Chinese economic recovery in the next stage, especially under the condition that
foreign demand is destroyed by COVID-19. We believe that the NPIs is necessary for all countries
and regions suffering from the COVID-19. Thus, being aware of the overall influence of services
sectors is critical for investors and policymakers all over the world.
Finally, for further research, more proper industry classification standards can be established
for or introduced into the spillover network analysis on different research targets. Exogenous
variables should be introduced into the industry-specific spillover networks of capital markets.
Then we can do more quantitative analysis on the risk contagion and spillover effects between the
exogenous shock and the securities of companies belonging to different industry sectors.

Note: Descriptive statistics of the 102 industry indices’ minute-per-minute returns includes means,
standard deviations (SD), skewness (Skew) and kurtosis (Kurt). The results of Jarque-Bera
normality test (JB test), the first order autocorrelation (AR1) and the augmented Dickey–Fuller
test (ADF) are also reported. *, **, and *** denote the rejection of the null hypothesis at the 10%,
5%, and 1% level, respectively. The null hypothesis for the AR1, the JB tests, and the ADF tests is
that the first-order autocorrelation is zero. In another word, the series is normally distributed, and
has a unit root. The number of observations counts 12084.
