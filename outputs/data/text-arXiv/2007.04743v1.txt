Redlining is the discriminatory practice whereby institutions avoided investment in certain neighborhoods due to their demographics. Here we explore the lasting impacts of redlining on the spread
of COVID-19 in New York City (NYC). Using data available through the Home Mortgage Disclosure
Act, we construct a redlining index for each NYC census tract via a multi-level logistical model. We
compare this redlining index with the COVID-19 statistics for each NYC Zip Code Tabulation Area.
Accurate mappings of the pandemic would aid the identification of the most vulnerable areas and
permit the most effective allocation of medical resources, while reducing ethnic health disparities.

INTRODUCTION

Systemic racial segregation has left many United
States (US) citizens—especially black Americans—
cloistered in adverse living conditions. Broadly, institutionalized racism encompasses policies, norms, and institutional practices (both intended and unintended) that
amount to racial disparity [1]. Historically, institutionalized racism has left nonwhite or racially mixed communities with inadequate housing, disinvestment, and
relatively low employment rates [2]. Many health researchers hypothesize that such practices of institutionalized racism are to blame for health disparities between
ethnic groups in the US at individual and neighborhood
levels [3]. Moreover, such health disparities are a particular concern during the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Current efforts to quantify inequalities surrounding the
COVID-19 pandemic in the US (see e.g. [4, 5]) rely on
identifying the vulnerability of subgroups according to
traditional CDC-defined risk factors such as old age and
underlying conditions [6]. However, racial differences in
the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths are so severe
that traditional risk factors alone cannot fully explain
such disparity [7–13]. In this study, we show that in New
York City (NYC) the demographics of a neighborhood
can imply enhanced risk for its residents and should be
considered when measuring an individual’s vulnerability
to COVID-19, in addition to the CDC traditionally defined risk factors. While several studies make use of the
preexisting health surveys to arrive at their results, we
make use of the data from the actual spread of the disease
in New York City to arrive at our conclusions. For other
COVID-19 studies focused on NYC, see e.g. [10–17].
Specifically, here we compare COVID-19 data to a
“redlining” index we construct for New York City (NYC).
The term ”redlining” refers to discriminatory practices
in which banks historically avoided investments based on
neighborhood demographics: therefore, denying services

to specific ethnic groups based on the locations of their
residences [18]. Historically, banks disproportionately denied mortgage applications from black Americans, barring them from entering more affluent, traditionally white
communities. Such practices have been a real and significant detriment to black Americans. In the context of
health research, redlining and other mortgage discrimination have been empirically blamed for racial health
disparities as such practices would assign black Americans to poor neighborhoods with lower standards of living. Limited access to nearby health care, poor air and
water quality, and stress from high levels of crime and impoverishment mean that living standards can be closely
linked with to health levels in the community [3]. Figure 1 shows the distribution of black residents in NYC.
This paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we
outline the construction of a redlining index for each census tract. Then in Section III, we discuss the COVID-19
statistics for NYC and compare these to the redlining index of Section II. In Section IV, we discuss certain limitations of our model and possible extensions, and in Section
V, we highlight the significance of our findings.

REDLINING INDEX

To assuage the public’s concern on mortgage discrimination, since 1975, the Federal Reserve Board has made
it compulsory for financial institutions to release information about the mortgage applicants and their applications
through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)
[18]. Currently, this data is publicly available online
[20]. However, only a few researchers to-date have made
use of the HMDA database in the context of health research. In these existing studies, the impacts of redlining
on long-term, noncommunicable diseases such as cancer
and those relating to perinatal health have been studied [21–23]. Another study [24] explored the effects of
redlining on access to medical resources. These studies concluded that redlining has a statistically significant
influence in increasing the rates of noncommunicable diseases and in decreasing access to healthcare.
Here we examine the relationship between redlining
and COVID-19 infections and outcomes. As such, we
also present the first study of the impact of redlining
on the spread of communicable diseases. To construct
a redlining index we follow similar method to that in
[21–23] and make use of the publicly available HMDA
data sets for years 2013-2017 [20]. In these data sets,
information about the applicant such as the applicant’s
ethnicity, income, loan amount, and sex was reported.
Information about the application, which includes the
purpose of the mortgage and the property type, was also
reported. The smallest unit of neighborhood reported in
the HMDA data set is the census tract.
Since we are interested in the health disparities between black and white ethnic groups, we excluded primary applicants that did not identify as black or white.
We also excluded applications for multi-family housing
or home improvement purposes, as well as incomplete
and withdrawn applications, from our analysis. After
this filtering, there was a total of 208, 960 applications
accounted for across 2095 census tracts1 within the five
year span of 2013-2017. We then geocoded the census
tracts into Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) using the
Census Bureau’s Relationship File [25].
Using the HMDA data, we constructed a redlining index using a multilevel logistical model and then evaluated
it on each census tract in NYC. The main predictor of
the logistical model was the ethnicity of the primary applicant. The outcome to be measured was the log-odds
of the probability of mortgage acceptance pij , where j
indexes each census tract and i indicates each individual within census tract j. Two covariates were utilysed,
based on the variables shown to be influential in previous
studies [21–23]: the applicant’s sex and the ratio between
the amount of loan requested given their income.

1

There are 2168 census tracts within NYC, those with very small
or no population or no population where omitted. With this
omission the analysis still covers all 177 Zip Codes of NYC.

FIG. 2. Values of the Redlining Index R constructed here.

The index was computed from the two-level equations:
Level 1 :
log[pij /(1 − pij )] = β0j + β1j rij + β2j sij + β3j lij
Level 2 :
βkj = γk0 + ukj

for k ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}

where, r and s are the ethnicity and sex of an applicant
i in census tract j (with rij = 1 for white and rij = 0 for
black; sij = 1 for a male and sij = 1 for a female), and
where l is the loan to income ratio of the applicant.
In level 2, the coefficients βkj are then identified with
a fixed factor γk0 , the coefficient that best fits all of the
data points, and a variation between census tracts j captured by ukj , with an assigned value such that each ukj
best fits all of the data points within census tract j.
Notably, β1j , which tracks the ethnicity of the applicants, provides a measure of the black-to-white difference
in mortgage acceptance for census tract j. Each of the
four variations βkj (with k ∈ 0, 1, 2, 3) were tested on
whether they improve the fit in terms of the χ2 statistic.
Permitting for variations due to the sex of the applicant,
u2j , was shown to not improve the fit, and therefore, was
excluded from the final model. However, the fixed effect
on the sex of the applicant γ20 was retained.
From fits of the logistical model to the HMDA data we
constructed the redlining index: R = eβ1j and quantified
each census tract along a continuous scale of mortgage
loan discrimination. In addition to this, one can identify
the global component of the redlining index RF = eγk0
such that R = RF eukj . For the 5-year dataset analysed,
the index R took values in the range 1.70 to 2.48 over
the 177 NYC ZCTA. For reference, R = 2.0 implies the
probability of mortgage acceptance of a white individual
is twice that of a black individual in a given census tract
(adjusting for sex and loan to income ratio). An average of 99.7 applications were considered from each census
tract, and an average of 1180.6 applications were considered for each ZCTA. The percentage of mortgage denial
from 2013-2017 in NYC ranged from 19.6% to 26.7%.

Table I displays the the adjusted likelihood ratio of
loan acceptance between 2013-2017 after each applicant
was adjusted for their loan to income ratio and their sex.
In addition to calculating the index R from all of the data
from 2013-2017, an unadjusted (for sex or income) index
RU with β2j = β2j = 0 was also calculated for individual
years. For reference, in the unadjusted case the global
component of the index was found to be RFU = 2.15 for
2013 and RFU = 2.09 for 2017. In both the adjusted index
R and unadjusted index RU , a white applicant was about
twice as likely to have their loan accepted than a black
applicant in each of the years spanning 2013-2017.
After the redlining indices were calculated for each census tract, we geocoded the census tracts into ZCTA. We
then weighed each census tract by their population and
calculated the redlining index for each ZCTA. The results are illustrated in Figure 2. Higher index scores indicate predominantly white, more affluent areas. Neighborhoods with the highest indices were Upper West (2.33)
and Upper East (2.31), and those with the lowest scores
were Rockaways (1.86) and Southeast Bronx (1.88).

COVID-19 SPREAD IN NYC

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). The pathogen was first identified in Wuhan, China in
December 2019 and rapidly led to a worldwide pandemic,
this was particularly pronounced in the US. Our analysis
focuses on the spread of COVID-19 in NYC, which was
an early epicentre for the pandemic in 2020.
Data on the spread of COVID-19 was retrieved from
NYC’s official website [26], which was updated daily.2
Tests and cases with unknown ZCTA were excluded from
our analysis. As of 5/26/2020, the ZCTA of 3.1% of all
positive tests and that of 1.1% of all tests could not be
identified. We assigned ZCTA to neighborhoods using
the ‘Zip Code Definitions of NYC Neighborhoods’ [27].
In Figures 3-5 we illustrate the variation in the number
of confirmed cases, percentage of positive tests, and total
deaths resulting from COVID-19 as of June 30 2020.

FIG. 3. Number of COVID-19 cases per 100 residents.

Specifically, two data sets were used: ‘tests-by-zcta’, detailing the
number of total tests and the number of positive tests across the
177 NYC ZCTA since April 1st; and ‘data-by-modzcta’, detailing
the number of deaths in each ZCTA since May 18th.

FIG. 6. Scatterplots exploring correlations between the redlining index R and COVID data between 15th - 20th of May 2020:
Left. R vs the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; Centre. R vs the percentage of positive tests. Right. R vs the number of
COVID-19 deaths. A Best fit line is shown, with the 95% confidence interval (shaded region).

The predominantly white neighborhoods of Greenwich
Village/Soho reported 0.89 cases per 100 residents (phr),
and lower manhattan had 0.078 phr, the lowest infection
numbers in NYC. While West Queens and Rockaways
were among the highest numbers of cases (3.52 and 3.51
phr, respectively), and both also had very low redlining
scores (R = 1.91, 1.86). Similar statements hold for
the proportion of positive tests. Moreover, Greenwich
Village/Soho had the least COVID deaths (0.065 phr),
whilst Rockaways which is predominantly Black/Latino,
reported the most deaths (0.46 phr).
Using the redlining index constructed in Section II, we
compute the Pearson correlation coefficient [28] between
the redlining index R and three COVID-19 data sets:
• The number confirmed COVID infections case.
• The percentage of positive tests ‘%+test’.
• The number of COVID deaths.

Specifically, we computed the correlation coefficient over
five day periods starting from April 1st 2020 until June
30st 2020. Over this 90 day period, the cumulative number of cases increased from 73,533 to 252,585, the cumulative number of tests rose from 127,550 to 1,691,978,
and the number of deaths spiked from 1374 to 18,492.
To gain some intuition, we took the data for each 5-day
period for which we calculated the correlation coefficient
and mapped each ZCTA to points on scatterplots in the
planes of R versus cases, percentage of positive tests, and
deaths. We show one set of plots for 15th - 20th of May
2020 in Figure 6. Moreover, Figure 7 shows the evolution
of the correlation coefficients over time (and a table of
the coefficients is given in the appendix, along with the
associated p values). Inspecting Figure 7, we note that
while the correlations started out relatively weak, they
all significantly strengthened over time and also settled.
It can be seen that the redlining index establishes a significant negative correlation with all three COVID data
sets. This suggests that in redlined neighborhoods, the
containment of the disease is harder, likely due to a lack
of sufficient medical resources. It may also suggest that
less individuals tend to seek medical care, and perhaps
that more individuals have to work and thus are at risk
of infection. Regardless the reason, the results emphasize
the need for more medical resources in redlined areas.

percentage positive tests, and number of deaths. The number
of cases, tests, deaths are shown shaded (with RH axis).

DISCUSSION

Since COVID-19 data was only reported in NYC in
each ZCTA, in our analysis we worked at the ZCTAlevel. However, had COVID-19 data been released at the
census tract level, a more detailed analysis could have
been conducted. Such a fine detailed analysis would be
interesting for identifying sub-pockets of vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, while the HMDA data does significantly increase the transparency of mortgage discrimination, potentially critical information such as the applicant’s employment status, debt, and credit score were not
reported. As such, these factors could not be included.

5
Notably, a previous study on the 1993-1999 HMDA
data set [29] observed that an application from a black
applicant was more likely to have missing ethnicity information than that of a white applicant. The study
thus concluded that mortgage discrimination visible in
the HMDA database is an underestimation of the true
severity of the problem. This may imply that redlining
may have an even larger impact on racial health disparities than found in our analysis leading to even stronger
correlations than reported in Figure 7.
Moreover, although we focused on black and white ethnic groups in this study, a potential future research directions would be to observe the impacts of residential
segregation on the spread of pandemic on other ethnic
groups. In particular, previous studies have concluded
that the healthiness of the Hispanics in Milwaukee [23]
and that of Chinese Americans [24] in Los Angeles are
affected by residential segregation.
V.

CONCLUSION

Our analysis quantifies the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on black Americans, a sub-group which has
previously shown to be disproportionately affected by
the pandemic [7–13]. As of June 2020, the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases among black NYC residents were
roughly 60% higher that of the white population after
age adjustment [26] and the number of COVID related
deaths was double for black Americans, compared to
white Americans. The risk factors determined by the
CDC [6]—old age and various underlying conditions—
alone are not enough to explain such disparity. This
naturally raises the question about whether medical resources were distributed equally among neighborhoods
or whether certain subgroups are more or less likely to
reach out of medical assistance. This study has endeavored to address these apparent health disparities through
the lens of historical residential segregation.
Moreover, this work contributes to measuring the lasting impacts of institutionalized racism on the spread of
communicable diseases (taking COVID-19 as a prime example). While the medical literature is clear that environmental factors influence healthiness, very few studies have quantified residential segregation and measured
its relationship with racial health disparities and even
those that have primarily examined exclusively noncommunicable diseases [21–24]. Notably, reasons for why
neighborhood-level factors should influence healthiness—
such as stress and scarce medical resources—apply similarly to communicable and noncommunicable diseases.
This work aims to minimize racial health disparities as
a consequence of the lasting impacts of institutionalized
racism, specifically during a pandemic when such disparities are amplified. As demonstrated by the present
case study of NYC, we suggest that such index based
analyses may be helpful in predicting the vulnerability of
subgroups in other cities that the COVID-19 has yet to
hit and to prepare for future pandemics.

Accurate mappings of this pandemic allow us to predict the spread of a communicable diseases and identify
the most vulnerable subgroups. This information should
be acted upon to more appropriately allocate medical resources in the future, to support the communities and
neighborhoods that are the most in need. Ultimately,
an accurate model of the spread of the COVID-19 can
minimize the lasting impacts of institutionalized racism
and ensure that ethnicity is not what guarantees good
healthcare. In the long run, quantitative analyses, such
as presented here, can guide policies to aid in the reduction of health disparities in the post-COVID-19 era.

This appendix provides a tabulation in Table II of the
Pearson correlation coefficients calculated in Section III.
These tabulated results are presented graphically in Figure 7 of the main text. Note that deaths were only
recorded in each ZCTA from May 18th. The table also
indicates the associated p-values for each time period.
Observe that while for the earliest date (4/1/2020) the
p-value was of marginal significance (p < 0.01), for subsequent dates the correlation was found to be pronounced
