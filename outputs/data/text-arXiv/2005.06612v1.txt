BACKGROUND:
Since COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019, various public health
interventions have been implemented across the world. As different measures
are implemented at different countries at different times, we conduct an assessment of the relative effectiveness of the measures implemented in 18 countries
and regions using data from 22/01/2020 to 02/04/2020.
METHODS:
We compute the top one and two measures that are most effective for the countries and regions studied during the period. Two Explainable AI techniques,
SHAP and ECPI, are used in our study; such that we construct (machine
learning) models for predicting the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt )
and use the models as surrogates to the real world and inputs that the greatest
1

influence to our models are seen as measures that are most effective.
FINDINGS:
Across-the-board, city lockdown and contact tracing are the two most effective
measures. For ensuring Rt < 1, public wearing face masks is also important.
Mass testing alone is not the most effective measure although when paired with
other measures, it can be effective. Warm temperature helps for reducing the
transmission.
INTERPRETATION:
After a period of city lockdown, the transmission of COVID-19 has been slowed.
However, as countries are considering lifting city lockdown in the next a few
weeks or months, to prevent resurgent disease, effort should be put to developing privacy preserving, practical and effective contact tracing techniques.

Research in Context
Evidence before this study

Since COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019, various

public health interventions have been implemented across the world. Wuhan has been locked
down since Jan 23, 2020; France closed its schools on March 16, 2020; South Korea banned
international travelers from Hubei on Feb 02, 2020; Singapore started contact tracing on January 23, 2020, etc. As for mid of April 2020, it seems countries that have implemented some of
these measures are seeing a reduced rate of number of confirmed cases growth. Yet, the different
2

countermeasures implemented by different countries at different time still pose the questions:
which countermeasures are effective? Moreover, the effectiveness of mass use of face masks has
been a controversial issue, with claims that mass use face mask being ineffective and essential
both exist. Lastly, the impact of temperature and humidity is also not entirely clear. Thus, we
present a comprehensive study that examines data from 18 countries and regions to understand
the effectiveness of such measures. We have used the Time Series Covid 19 Confirmed data set
from https://www.kaggle.com for the number of confirmed cases, COVID 19 Containment measures data set also from https://www.kaggle.com together with Wikipedia and
Google search with keywords containing country name and control measures such as “South
Korea International Travel Ban” to find the dates of measure implementation, and data from
https://rp5.ru/Weather_in_the_world to find the temperature and humidity.
Added value of this study

As of mid-April 2020, most countries in eastern Europe and Africa

are still in the early stage of the pandemic, with relatively small number of confirmed cases;
understanding the effectiveness of countermeasures are important for controlling the spread.
Countries in western Europe, Australasia and North America which have implemented strict
control measures for a few weeks are discussing relaxing such measures including lifting lockdown; understanding the effectiveness of measures could help governments in these countries
adjust their policies so they do not risk resurgent disease while saving healthcare and social
resources.
Implications of all the available evidence We identify city lockdown and contact tracing as
the most effective countermeasures. Mass testing, mask use by the public, and warm weather
are also useful for controlling transmission. For countries that are implementing city lockdown,
once that is lifted, contact tracing has been most successfully implemented with technology
based approaches such as tracking mobile phones, developing policies along with technolo3

gies that support such contact tracing while providing privacy protection should be seriously
considered; promoting mask use and ensuring its supplies should also be considered.

Introduction
COVID-19 has spread globally for more than three months since it was first identified in December 2019. Shortly after its initial identification, various control measures have been implemented in different countries for the purposes of containing and delaying the pandemic; at
the moment, some of the less affected countries are considering implementing these measures.
Thus, a major question to be answered is that: among these control measures, what are the more
effective ones, at different stages of the disease development?
Thus, the overarching goal of this work is to identify factors that are most influential in
controlling the spread of the disease. Rt , the average number of secondary cases generated by
one primary case with symptom onset on day t, is one of the most important quantities used to
measure the epidemic spread. If Rt > 1 , then the epidemic is expanding at time t, whereas if
Rt < 1, then it is shrinking at time t. We want to identify factors that are most influential for
controlling Rt .
Explainable AI (XAI) is a rising field in AI. In addition to developing AI systems that making accurate predictions, XAI systems “explain” their predictions (1–3, 9, 12, 13). The development of XAI is motivated by building trustworthy systems and revealing insights from data.
Still in its infancy, several XAI techniques such as Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) (8)
and Explainable Classification with Probabilistic Inferences (ECPI) (4), have been developed
in recent years for identifying decisive features in prediction tasks. These techniques are datadriven; they “explain” a prediction by pointing out factors that are “most significant” for the
prediction purely based on the data provided.
Much effort has been put into COVID-19 data collection by the global community. As of
4

early April 2020, time series data containing daily confirmed cases in more than 100 countries
are made publicly available at online repositories. With help of Internet search engines, one can
identify control measures implemented in different countries and their respective implementation time. Using such data, with Machine Learning (ML) techniques, we construct classification
models that predict Rt . We then apply XAI techniques to examine the developed ML models
and identify key factors that are most influential to their predictions. In this way, the constructed
ML models serve as surrogates to the real world; and identifying effective factors in controlling
Rt becomes explaining the classifications given by the developed ML models.

Methods
Data Preparation. Our analysis is based on the following information:
• Implementation dates of control measures as shown in Table 1.
• The daily reported number of confirmed cases from 22/01/2020 to 02/04/2020 in countries and regions shown in Table 1.
• Temperature and humidity during our study period at these countries and regions.
From daily reported number of confirmed cases, we apply a method of estimating Rt as reported
in Flaxman, et al. (5). We start by introducing a serial interval distribution, which models the
time between a person getting infected and he/she subsequently infecting another people, as
a Gamma distribution g with mean 7 and standard deviation 4.5 (these two parameters are
reported in (14)); we also assume this serial interval distribution is the same for all countries
and regions studied in this work. The number of new infections ct on a given day t is given by
the following discrete convolution function:
ct = Rt

Contact
Tracing (CT)

where gs =

R s+0.5
τ =s−0.5

g(τ )dτ for s = 2, 3, . . . and g1 =

R 1.5
τ =0

g(τ )dτ , cτ is the number of new

infections on day τ . Thus, new infections identified on day t depend on the number of new
infections in days prior to t, weighted by the discretized serial interval distribution, which is the
aforementioned Gamma distribution.
From Equation 1, solve for Rt , we have:
ct
τ =0 cτ gt−τ

Rt = Pt−1

(2)

Since ct and cτ are available from our data directly, e.g., ct is the difference between the confirmed case on day t and the confirmed case on day t−1, and gt−τ can be obtained by integrating
the Gamma distribution, we now have a way to compute Rt for all countries on all days between
22/01/2020 and 02/04/2020.
We then compose a data set in a tabular form where each row describes information for
one country/region on a day, containing the number of new confirmed cases on that day, days
since each of the control measures that have been implemented, and the temperature as well as
humidity of that day. Rt is added to every row in the data set and later used as the target for
prediction. Since Rt calculated as such is sensitive to noise at the number of new infection cases
on a given day and the data set we use contains imperfection, e.g., for the United Kingdom, both
14/03/2020 and 15/03/2020 have 1140 confirmed cases so there is no increase on 15/03/2020,
we thus run a sliding-window mean filter with radius 1 on the data for noise removal. Moreover,
as Rt calculated in Equation 2 assumes a reasonably large t, (otherwise both cτ and gt−τ would
be too small, resulting an artificially large Rt ), we drop entries with confirmed case less than 20.
In other words, we only use data where there are more than 20 accumulated confirmed cases in
that country / region; and as the number of confirmed case is monotonically increasing, there is
no “skipped” dates. For instance, our Singapore cases start on 03/02/2020, Japan cases start on
02/02/2020, and Germany cases start on 25/02/2020. Figure 1 illustrates Rt computed by the
7

presented method for Japan, Singapore, Australia and Hubei.
A fraction of this data set is shown in Table 2 for illustration. The data in the first row
records that Rt is 1.34, with 4 new confirmed cases, 22 days after government advocation, 12
days after mass use of face mask, school closure, and city lockdown not implemented, 20 days
after mass testing, 15 days after international travel ban, 21 days after contract tracing, as well
as temperature and humidity 27.825 and 74.37, respectively. The data set contains 800 entries
in total.

Since we aim for obtaining easily interpretable qualitative results, we further discretize our
data into category intervals as follows:
• NC: [0,10), [10, 100), [100, ∞)
• GA, MU, SC, CL, MT, ITB, CT: [0,1), [1, 5), [5, 10), [10,15), [15, ∞)
• T: (-∞, 0), [0, 10), [10, 20), [20, ∞)
• H: [0, 40), [40, 80), [80, ∞)
Thus, the number of new cases is put into 3 categories, represented with integers 0. . . 2, respectively. Each of GA, MU, SC, CL, PTC, MT, ITB and CT is discretized into 5 categories,

with each category represented with an integer 0. . . 4. Similarly, temperature and humidity are
discretized into 4 and 3 categories, respectively. Table 3 shows the result of discretization from
data shown in Table 2.

XAI Techniques and Problem Formulation.

Two different XAI techniques for identifying

decisive features have been used in this study: Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), and
Explainable Classification with Probabilistic Inferences (ECPI). With both SHAP and ECPI,
we formulate the factor importance problem as two binary Explainable Classification problems:
given a data entry (row) as shown in Table 3, classify whether the Rt (for that row) is greater
than some threshold θ; if an entry is classified as negative (Rt thus less than or equal to θ), then
identify the features that are most influential to the classification.
SHAP is based on Shapley value, a game theory concept that assigns a unique distribution
of a total surplus generated by the coalition of all players in a cooperative game. In our context,
each factor with its value, e.g., NC = 0, GA = 4, MU = 3, etc., is viewed as a “player” in the
game where the outcome is in one of the two classes (Rt being either greater than θ, or not).
Shapley value for each feature-value describes its “contribution” to the outcome classification.
ECPI is a probabilistic logic based explainable classification algorithm. ECPI maps a dataset
into a knowledge-base in probabilistic logic and performs classification with probabilistic logic
inference. ECPI computes explanation by identifying the subset of feature values that gives the
same inference result as the full set (or as close as possible to the full set when it is not possible
10

to infer the same result). In our context, roughly speaking, from feature value NC = 0, GA = 4,
MU = 3, etc., one deduces Rt is in some class (either Rt < θ or not), then the subset of these
feature values that also infer Rt in the same class is the explanation.
Both SHAP and ECPI identify key features for prediction instances with SHAP being a
model-agnostic method that computes only feature importance and ECPI an interpretable model
that makes the prediction as well. Technically, two major differences between SHAP and ECPI
are that (1) SHAP considers features individually when evaluating their “contribution” whereas
ECPI considers all coalition among features; (2) SHAP estimates the Shapley characteristic
function, the function describing the total expected sum of payoffs the players can obtain by
cooperation, from data whereas ECPI does not perform this estimation.
Since our goal is to obtain explanations for cases where Rt < θ, the entire dataset is used
for training the ML models. Then, for each entry in the dataset which has its Rt < θ, we
compute the top k most influential features with both SHAP and ECPI. For instance, for the
entry (Guangdong, 08/02/2020):

we let θ = 1, then: SHAP finds CT=4 (CT implemented for more than 15 days) and CL=4
(CL implemented for more than 15 days) being the most and second most influential factors,
respectively; whereas ECPI finds CL=4 and MU=3 (MU implemented for 10-15 days) being
the top two factors. The identified most influential features from all entries are aggregated and
reported in the next section.

Results
With SHAP and ECPI, we study the two classification cases for θ = 1, 2. For each case, we
compute the top k (k = 1, 2) features that are the most influential. There are 228 and 435 entries
with Rt < 1 and Rt < 2, respectively. The results are shown in Figure 2.
11

Figure 2: Top k = 1, 2 influential factors for Rt < 1 and Rt < 2.

12

Figure 3: Influential factors for daily new cases in different ranges.
From Figure 2, several qualitative interpretations can be obtained. We can see that City
Lockdown (CL) and Contact Tracing (CT) are most influential, for all parameter combinations
(θ = 1, 2 and k = 1, 2). Both measures are effective when they take value 4, meaning they are
implemented for more than 15 days. Mask Use (MU) and Mass Testing (MT) both show some
influence, although not to the level of CL and CT. School Closure (SC), International Travel
Ban and Government Advocation (GA) rank lower in their effectiveness. Humidity plays no
role completely whereas warm temperature could be helpful. The bars shown on New Cases
(NC) might be interpreted as: when Rt is sufficiently small, it is likely to stay in that case.
Figure 3 and 4 show influential factors for daily new cases in three ranges: 0-10, 10-100,
and > 100 for Rt < 1 and Rt < 2, respectively. For Rt < 1, we see that CL is the most effective
single measure and CL,CT the most effective pair, regardless the number of new cases, agreed
by both SHAP and ECPI. For Rt < 2, the top effective measures are CL, CT, MT and MU. The
top pairs are harder to select, CL,NC, CL,MT, CT,SC and MT,MU are more effective than others.

Discussion
Since COVID-19 was identified in December 2019, there are a few works which have been
dedicated to understanding the effect of non-pharmaceutical countermeasures. Leung et al. (7)
estimated Rt in four Chinese cities and ten province between mid January to mid February.
They found that though aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions such as city lockdown
have made the first wave of COVID-19 outside of Hubei abated, control measures should be relaxed gradually. Our results, asserting city lockdown being the most effective measure confirms
their findings.
In (10), the authors evaluated the effectiveness of surveillance and containment measures
for the first 100 patients with COVID-19 in Singapore. The surveillance strategy in Singapore
includes applying the case definition at medical consultations, tracing contacts of patients, enhancing surveillance among different patient groups and allowing clinician discretion. It was

14

found that rapid identification and isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts, and active
monitoring of other contacts have been effective in suppressing expansion of the outbreak. Our
results find that contact tracing being the overall second effective measure (after city lockdown)
confirms their results.
In (6), the authors studied the real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data
including travel history to investigate the role of travel restrictions in limiting the spread of
COVID-19. It was found that travel restrictions are particularly useful in the early stage of an
outbreak, while the effect will drop when the outbreak is more widespread. A combination of
interventions may be necessary though the individual role of each intervention is yet determined.
Our results show that international travel ban, although exactly same as their work on intercity travel, but also on the effectiveness of restricting travel, is not nearly as effective as other
measures such as city lockdown and contact tracing.
In (11), the authors built an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR)
model to estimate the effect of physical distancing measures, such as extended school closures
and workplace distancing, on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic. It was found that
sustaining these measures are effective in reducing the size of epidemic. Our results, especially
the ones from ECPI, show that school closure has a positive effect in lowering Rt .
As a data-driven modeling approach, our work is limited by a number of factors. Firstly,
all results are based on data collected from the selected 18 countries and regions during the
period of 22/01/2020 to 03/04/2020, although results might be generalizable, but are about
these regions during the said period. Thus, when applying these results to other regions and
other time, they should be viewed indicative. Secondly, the data used is inherently ambiguous,
e.g., “contact tracing” and “mass testing” have been implemented at different countries, but it
is unlikely the same standard has been applied. Thus, although our methods are quantitative,
due to the qualitative nature of the data, one should read our results qualitatively. Thirdly, we
15

rely on the calculated Rt to label our data, which is then used to construct our models. The
calculation used is reported in (5) with parameters found in (14). We are aware that Rt is an
estimate that can be approximated with more than one method, some authors such as (7) give a
much smaller estimate of Rt for Beijing in January (they estimate Rt being close to 0.5 whereas
our calculation shows it is greater than 2; although ours drops to below 0.5 after February 10,
same as theirs), different results might be obtained if Rt is estimated differently.
In conclusion, we applied two machine learning and explainable AI methods in studying
the influence of factors affecting the spread of COVID-19. We find city lockdown and contact
tracing being the two most effective control measures, surpassing mass testing, school closure,
international travel ban and mask use. As countries are considering lifting city lockdown, to
prevent resurgent disease, effort should be put to developing privacy preserving, practical and
effective contact tracing techniques.

Appendix
Classification Performance Since the reliability of our explanation results depends on the
quality of our ML models, which depend on the quality of data and the discretization process
we used, we first present some classification results. The two datasets are randomly divided
into 90% / 10% split with 90% used for training and 10% for testing. We present results using
a random forest classifier with 100 trees, neural network with two hidden layers with 12 and 10
nodes each, and ECPI. We measure performance with precision and recall, which are defined as
precision =

true positive
,
true positive + f alse positive

and
recall =

true positive
.
true positive + f alse negative

The precision and recalls are shown in Table 4. These results show that effective models can be
built with the dataset and our ECPI model gives indicative predictions.
