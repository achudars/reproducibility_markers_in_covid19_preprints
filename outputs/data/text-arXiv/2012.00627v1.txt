Abstract
Zhou et al. reported the discovery of RmYN02, a strain closely related to SARS-CoV-2, which is
claimed to contain a natural PAA amino acid insertion at the S1/S2 junction of the spike protein at
the same position of the PRRA insertion that has created a polybasic furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV2. The authors support with their findings the theory that the furin cleavage site insertion present in
SARS-CoV-2 is natural. Because no nucleotide alignment with closely related strains of the region
coding for the supposed insertion is provided by Zhou et al., we have applied several alignment
algorithms to search for the most parsimonious alignments. We conclude that RmYN02 does not
contain an insertion at the S1/S2 junction when compared to its closest relatives at the nucleotide
level, but rather a 6-nucleotide deletion and that the claimed PAA insertion is more likely to be the
result of mutations. A close examination of RmYN02 sequencing records and assembly methods is
wishful. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2, with its 12-nucleotide insertion at the S1/S2 junction remains
unique among its sarbecovirus relatives.

Recently, Zhou et al.[1] reported the discovery of a novel coronavirus strain RmYN02, which the
authors claim to contain a natural PAA amino acid insertion at the S1/S2 junction of the spike protein
at the same position of the PRRA insertion that has created a polybasic furin cleavage site in severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Zhou et al. have come to their conclusion based on a multiple sequence alignment of RmYN02 with
several beta coronavirus strains, namely SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV GZ02, RaTG13, ZC45, ZXC21,
Pangolin/GD/2019, and Pangolin/GX/P5L/2017. Their findings are reported in an amino acid
alignment diagram where the supposed PAA amino acid insertion is placed between the 680 (serine)
and 685 (arginine) amino acids of SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein.
However, no nucleotide alignment of the same region is provided by Zhou et al. that would allow the
reader to identify the underlying nucleotides (CCT GCA GCG) coding the claimed PAA insertion in
RmYN02 in relation to the other strains analyzed. We have thus performed a CLUSTAL W multiple
nucleotide sequence alignment of the strains reported in Zhou et al., but were unable to observe the
claimed insertion (Fig. 1A). RmYN02 seems instead to contain a 6-nucleotide deletion at the S1/S2
junction when compared to the other strains, and the only insertion observed when aligning the
genomes in question is the well-known 12-nucleotide insertion CT CCT CGG CGG G (PRRA) into SARS-

CoV-2. The 6-nucleotide deletion in RmYN02 at the S1/S2 junction is even more apparent when
SARS-CoV-2 is excluded from the multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 1B).
We believe that including SARS-CoV-2 in the alignment together with RmYN02 and other strains is
methodologically incorrect, as the implied underlying hypothesis which the analysis is meant to test
is that SARS-CoV-2’s PRRA insertion is of natural origin. Thus, including SARS-CoV-2 in the alignment
not only biases the alignment algorithm, but also pre-supposes the conclusion that the PRRA insert is,
indeed, natural. To prove that inserts like PRRA occur naturally, strains that exhibit similar inserts
must be compared to their relative strains, excluding SARS-CoV-2 from the analysis. Our analyses
show that RmYN02 does not contain an insertion at the S1/S2 junction when compared to its closest
relatives and the claimed PAA insertion is more likely to be the result of mutations. Pairwise
comparison between RmYN02 and its closest relatives (RaTG13, ZC45, ZXC21) confirms this
conclusion, when either RmYN02 (Fig. 1C) or ZC45 (Fig. 1D) is used as an anchor, and instead
produces a 2-nt deletion in the coding region for PAA (Fig. 1D). If RmYN02 truly had an insertion
comparable to the PRRA insertion in SARS-CoV-2, we would have expected such an insertion to be
clearly observable in pairwise comparisons to its closest relatives, which are RaTG13, ZC45, ZXC21,
and Pangolin/GD/2019 (Fig. 1E).
A close examination of the S1/S2 region reveals that in RmYN02 it is 6 nucleotides (2 amino acids)
shorter than those of its related strains RaTG13, Pangolin/GD/2019, ZC45, and ZXC21. Therefore, to
support the claimed PAA insertion not only a 9-nucleotide insertion, but also a 15-nucleotide
deletion must have occurred. While this is theoretically possible, we propose 3 alternatives of more
parsimonious alignments which either do not have any insertions (ver. 1 and ver. 3 in Fig. 1F), or at
most have a 3-nucleotide insertion (ver. 2 in Fig. 1F). The alignment proposed by CLUSTAL W also did
not produce any insertions (ver. “Clustal W” in Fig. 1F).
Rather than a complete 12-nucleotide deletion of the region in RmYN02 that corresponds to QTQT in
RaTG13 as proposed by Zhou et al., a more parsimonious scenario is a 3-nucleotide deletion split
between the first and fourth codons of QTQT, thereby turning it into NSP in RmYN02. Another
possibility, proposed by CLUSTAL W, is a 6-nucleotide deletion in the middle of the nucleotides
coding for QTN, turning it into a P.
On the other side of the PAA(R) insertion claimed by Zhou et al., we feel that a more parsimonious
alignment of RmYN02 is best elucidated via comparing it to its close relative strains ZC45 and
RaTG13: in particular, the CGC AGT nucleotides in ZC45 coding for RS align best to the GCG CGT
nucleotides in RmYN02, having possibly resulted from an insertion of G and deletion of A nucleotides
in RmYN02 relative to ZC45 (Fig. 1G).
Finally, we should not discount the possibility that the observed 6-nucleotide deletion in RmYN02 at
the S1/S2 junction, so uncharacteristic of its relative strains, is a result of sequencing error rather
than a bona fide deletion.
While further virus collecting expeditions might produce unanticipated discoveries, to date SARSCoV-2 remains unique among its sarbecovirus relatives not only due to a polybasic furin site at the
S1/S2 junction, but also due to the length of the locus surrounding the 12-nucleotide insert that has
created the furin site: SARS-CoV-2 is at least 12 nucleotides longer at that junction than any of its
sarbecovirus relatives. Its PRRA insertion is beyond any doubts, and was not accompanied by any
deletions, which stands in sharp contrast to what is observed in RmYN02.
In closing, we would like to mention that the RmYN02 sequence is presently only available in the
GISAID database, which is password protected and requires registration. We would propose that
RmYN02 should also be made available at GenBank.
