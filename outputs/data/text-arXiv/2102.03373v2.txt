A
carefully review how it dealt with the first wave of outbreak. Lessons from the first
experience should be useful to avoid indiscriminate closures and, above all, to determine
universal (understandable) parameters to guide the introduction of containment measures
to reduce the spreading of the virus. The use of few (effective) parameters is indeed of
extreme importance to create a link between authorities and population, allowing the latter
to understand the reason for some restrictions and, consequently, to allow an active participation in the fight against the pandemic. Testing strategies, fitting skew parameters (as mean,
mode, standard deviation, and skewness), mortality rates, and weekly CoViD-19 spreading
data, as more people are getting infected, were used to compare the first wave of the outbreak in the Italian regions and to determine which parameters have to be checked before
introducing restrictive containment measures. We propose few universal parameters that,
once appropriately weighed, could be useful to correctly differentiate the pandemic situation
in the national territory and to rapidly assign the properly pandemic risk to each region.

I. Introduction
Let’s begin this article by analysing the data of deaths
per million of inhabitants in the world as of December 31, 2020. In Figure 1, we find the data for the
worldwide countries with a population greater than 10
million people and a number of deaths per million of
inhabitants (DpM) over 100. In the attached Table,
we also find the explicit data (absolute numbers of confirmed deaths, populations and DpM) for the countries
with a DpM greater than 240. The data can be looked
up at the Coronavirus Source Data by Our World in
Data [1]. Italy appears on the second place among the
countries with the highest mortality rate with 1226.6
DpM, the number is obtained by dividing the absolute
number of CoViD-19 confirmed deaths at December
31, i.e. 74159, by the Italian population (60.46 million
of inhabitants). The highest DpM number, 1684.9,
belongs to Belgium. For this country, it is important
to spend some words regarding this. In the beginning

ΣδΛ

of the pandemic, for most countries around the world,
the CoViD-19 death toll was tallied from patients in
the hospitals who tested positive for CoViD-19. Belgian authorities have gone further than that, by also
including the deaths of non-hospitalized people who
are suspected of having the virus, in particular the
deaths in nursing (elderly) homes. Since the beginning,
Belgium is one of the few countries in Europe that
have strictly followed and, maybe even extended the
criteria for the CoViD-19 death classification, given
by the World Health Organization: “A death due to
CoViD-19 is defined for surveillance purposes as a
death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in
a probable or confirmed CoViD-19 case, unless there
is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be
related to CoViD disease (e.g. trauma). There should
be no period of complete recovery from CoViD-19
between illness and death. A death due to CoViD-19
may not be attributed to another disease (e.g. cancer)
and should be counted independently of pre-existing

conditions that are suspected of triggering a severe
course of CoViD-19” [2]. For example, when Belgium
reported 6262 deaths, 52% of those fatalities were in
nursing homes. Of these, only 4.5% were confirmed to
have had CoViD-19, with the rest just being suspected
cases. It led Belgian CoViD-19 task-force spokesman
and virologist Steven van Gucht to suggest that when
we compare Belgium with other countries the Belgian
death rate should be divided by two [3]. In Italy, the
positivity to Sars-Cov-2 alone is not sufficient to consider death as due to CoViD-19, the presence of all
the following four conditions is also necessary: Death
occurred in a patient definable as a microbiologically
confirmed case (molecular swab) of CoViD-19; Presence of a clinical and instrumental picture suggesting
CoViD-19; Absence of a clear cause of death other
than CoViD-19; Lack of full clinical recovery period
between illness and death [4]. Looking at the ranking of countries by DpM on June 28, Belgium, Spain,
United Kingdom, Italy and France appear, respectively,
with 830, 606, 593, 574, and 456. Considering the ratio
of the reported CoViD-19 mortality and the excess
mortality, the adjusted deaths per million became 755
(Belgium), 1010 (Spain), 742 (United Kingdom), 857
(Italy), and 470 (France) [5]. Clearly showing that,
during the first pandemic wave, the CoViD-19 death
toll was significantly underestimated in Spain (−40%),
United Kingdom (−20%), and Italy (− 33%).
In Figure 2, we find an infographic with the data for
the Italian regions and the autonomous provinces. In
the attached Table, we also find the absolute numbers
of confirmed deaths, populations and DpM. The data
of the Protezione Civile Italiana [6] are available for
download at GitHub [7]. The regions of North-Western
Italy (Val d’Aosta, Lombardia, Liguria, Piemonte) appear in the top 4, with a 36315 total deaths, which
with a total population of 16.11 M implies 2254.2
DpM. Immediately after these regions, we find the 3
regions (Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto) and the 2 autonomous provinces (Bolzano, Trento)
of North-East Italy with 17600 total of deaths which
with a total population of 11.66 M leads to 1509.4 DpM.
Going down the table, we find the 4 Central regions
(Marche, Toscana, Umbria, Lazio) and one of Southern regions (Abruzzo) with 10850 deaths which with a
total population of 13.3 M implies 815.8 DpM. Finally,
the remaining Southern regions (Molise, Puglia, Campania, Basilicata, Calabria) and the two islands (Sicilia,
Sardegna) count 9405 total deaths, which with a total
population of 19.15 M leads to 491.1 DpM. The geographical DpM difference amongst the Italian regions
can be shown by using the red color for the regions with
a DpM ≥ 1800, orange for 1200 ≤ DpM < 1800, yellow
for 600 ≤ DpM < 1200, green for 300 ≤ DpM < 600,
and, finally, cyan for DpM < 300.
The previous analysis introduces our next discussion.
Why were the measures taken to tackle the first pandemic wave the same throughout the entire country?

ΣδΛ

Did we have indicators that could avoid too restrictive
measures for areas where the virus had not yet arrived?
Did we have pandemic indicators to anticipate containment measures for the Northern regions where the
virus had already spread for some time?

The previous analysis introduces our next discussion.
Why were the measures taken to tackle the first pandemic wave the same throughout the entire country?
Did we have indicators that could avoid too restrictive
measures for areas where the virus had not yet arrived?
Did we have pandemic indicators to anticipate containment measures for the Northern regions where the
virus had already spread for some time?
To answer the previous questions, let us see what
containment actions the Italian authorities have adopted in the first 10 days of March 2020. The first
restrictive measures of prohibition of exit from and to
access in some municipalities of Lombardy (Bertonico,
Casalpusterlengo, Castelgerundo, Castiglione D’Adda,
Codogno, Fombio, Maleo, San Fiorano, Somaglia, Terranova dei Passerini) and a municipality of Veneto (Vo’)
were adopted by the Italian authorities with Decreto
del Presidente del Consigli dei Ministri (DPCM) of
the 1st of March, DPCM200301 at [8]. Seven days
later, the measure to avoid any movement of persons to and from these territories, as well as within
the same ones, except for movements motivated by
proven work needs, situations of necessity or health
reasons were extended to the whole Lombardia and
some provinces of Emilia-Romagna (Modena, Parma,
Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, and Rimini), Marche (Pesaro
and Urbino), Piemonte (Alessandria, Asti, Novara,
Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, Vercelli), and Veneto (Padova,
Treviso, and Venice), DPCM200308 at [8]. One day
later, the measurements concerned the entire national
territory, DPCM200309 at [8]. A sequence of decrees
in just a few days that clearly shows the panic of the
Italian authorities. Panic probably due to the lack of
an adequate pandemic plan to deal with the outbreak.
After January 11, when the first CoViD-19 victim
in China was confirmed, after January 13, the day on
which the virus caused the first death outside China
(Thailand), after January 24, when the first cases in
France were confirmed, after January 30, the date

health emergency [9], Italian authorities should have
immediately activated the pandemic plan by worrying,
for example, about having a large supply of personal
protective equipments, the careful monitoring of lung
diseases compared to previous years and the control of
intensive care units in the country.
In the excellent report [10] prepared by the CoViD19 Emergency Team at the WHO European Office
for Investment for Health and Development in Venice
(Italy), the authors discussed why the first phase of
Italy’s response to the CoViD-19 brought its health
system to near collapse creating a panic in the population. In February, life in Italy had not changed much:
carnival festivities, tourists in the cities, people in the
ski resorts and football fans at the stadium. A scary example was the UEFA Champions League match played
at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium of Milano between the
Italian team of Bergamo, Atalanta, and the Spanish
one of Valencia with 45792 spectators. According to
an analysis conducted by INTWIG [11], in collaboration with Report [12] and BergamoNews [13], among
the 3400 (of 36000) Atalanta fans interviewed more
than 20% had symptoms compatible with CoViD-19
in the 15 days following the match. This football
match was a clear pandemic bomb that then made
Bergamo become a symbol of the epidemic that devastated Lombardia between February and March 2020.
A study of the Institute Mario Negri (Bergamo) and
of the Deparment of Biomedical and Clinical Science,
University of Milano [14] estimated the cumulative
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Bergamo in
a group of workers who returned to the workplace
after the end of the Italian lockdown on 5th May 2020.
Performing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) to detect the humoral response against the
spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2, as
well as nasopharyngeal swabs to assess the presence
of SARS-CoV-2 using real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the researchers
observed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
the province of Bergamo reached 38.5%, significantly
higher than has been reported for most other regions
worldwide. By using the result of this study, we can
also calculate the real Infection Fatality Rate for the
outbreak in Bergamo. The IFR is one of the important numbers alongside the herd immunity threshold,
and has implications for the scale of an epidemic and
how seriously we should take a new disease. Assuming that the 38.5% of the Bergamo population was
infected by the virus, the IFR in this area reduces
from 20% (comfirmed deaths over confirmed infected
people) to almost 1% in perfect agreement with the
interval between 0.5% and 1% calculated across different countries [15]. Observe that for a common flu, the
IFR is around 0.1%. Just a factor 3 (i.e. 0.3% instead
of 0.1%) without a vaccine is sufficient to lead to a
collapse of the health systems of most countries in the
world.

ΣδΛ

The study we aim to present in this report is based
on the analysis of 45 pandemic weeks. The central
day of the weeks, around which we will calculate our
7-day averages is Thursday, with the first week centred
on February 27 and the last one on December 31.
Before presenting the analysis of pandemic data, it
is convenient to spend a few words on the situation
of the intensive care units (ICUs) in Italy before the
first and second pandemic waves. Intensive care units,
providing treatment for people who are in a very critical
situation, are staffed with specially trained healthcare
professionals, and contain sophisticated monitoring
equipment. Due to the fact that some people infected
by CoViD-19 may be unable to breathe on their own,
they need to use a machine that helps with breathing
(a ventilator) and monitoring equipment to measure
important body functions, such as heart rate, blood
pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood. The
collapse of the intensive care units surely was and still
is the main preoccupation in facing this pandemic. We
observe that the collapse of the health system is not
only due to the lack of intensive care beds but also to
the lack of trained healthcare professionals (this was
one of the main problems in Italy). The total number
of beds in ICUs at the beginning of the outbreak was
5179. In Summer, the commissioner (Domenico Arcuri)
responsible for the implementation and coordination
of the measures necessary for the containment and
contrast of the epidemiological emergency CoViD-19
prepared a plan to create 3553 additional ICUs. On
October 13, the call for companies closed, and the
start of the implementation work was scheduled for
the end of October. Too late, because at that time
the second wave in Italy had already arrived. In the
meantime, the regions added a total of 1279 stable
beds to their initial 5179 and so the current dowry
is 6458 places [16]. This implementation was done
with significant regional differences also due to the
accumulated delays: The regional plans were expected
at the end of June and instead were only approved at
the end of July. The situation of intensive care beds
for the Italian regions at the beginning of the first
and second pandemic waves is shown in the following
graphics

Organization is 150 per million of inhabitants. To understand the critical situation in Italy at the beginning
of the first pandemic wave, we will highlight with the
red color the regions with a number of intensive care
beds less than 75, with orange those with a number
of beds greater than or equal to 75 but less than 100,
with yellow greater than or equal to 100 but less than
125, with green greater than or equal to 125 but less
than 150, and, finally, with cyan greater than or equal
to 150.

Even after the implementation of new intensive care
beds, only 4 regions, Friuli Venezia Giulia (144.5 ICUs
per million), Basilicata (131.1), Liguria (135.5), and
Lazio (127.3), appear in green and 2, Veneto (168.1)
and Val d’Aosta (158.7) in cyan. Campania presents
the most critical situation with 73.8 ICUs per million
of inhabitants. Notwithstanding this critical situation
(red zone), at December 31, Campania with a DpM
of 491.2 (green zone) appears in the lower part of
the regional DpM Table and at the beginning of the
infographic shown in Figure 2.

II. Delayed action and lockdown
As observed in the Introduction, the Italian government, in an attempt to stop the spreading of the first
wave of the pandemic, adopted strict containment
measures (lockdown) throughout the whole national
territory starting from March 9. For the second wave,
on the other hand, the Italian authorities applied the
regional division into colored zones of pandemic risk.
In Table 1, we find, region by region, the number
of the daily averages for positive (column A), hospitalized (B), hospitalized in ICUs (C) and deaths (D).
In this Table, we also find the population (P) of each
region and the numbers of daily averages for positive
(A∗ ), hospitalized (B∗ ), hospitalized in ICUs (C∗ ), and
deaths (D∗ ) per million of inhabitants. The data of
Table 1 were used to prepare Figure 3. To facilitate
the understanding of data and tables, we will analyse
some specific cases. Let us consider the situation of
Lombardia in the second pandemic week (centred at
March 5). In this week, the daily average of positives, hospitalized, hospitalized in intensive care, and

ΣδΛ

deaths was 1971.3, 1505.1, 259.1, and 34.7. To compare Lombardia with the other regions, we normalise
these number by its population (10.104 M) obtaining:
195.1, 149.0, 25.6, 3.4. One of the most important
pandemic parameter (often underestimated during the
first pandemic wave) is the ratio of hospitalized over
positive people. Indeed, when a minimum threshold
of hospitalized (20 per million) is reached, the hospitalized/positives ratio is the first indicative number of
the gravity of the disease. The more advanced the
stage of infection is the more diffusion we have, so
it becomes more likely that weaker groups will be affected and more people will need hospitalization. The
more people are hospitalized the more people could
complicate their clinical status with the possibility of
needing intensive care. In the second pandemic week,
Lombardia had 149.0 hospitalized per million of inhabitants and 195.1 positives to CoViD-19 leading to a
scary 76.4%. In Figure 3, we have chosen the cyan
color when this ratio is less than 10%, green between
10% and 20%, yellow between 20% and 30%, orange
between 30% and 40%, and, finally, red when the ratio
is greater than 40%. Other indicators such as hospitalized in ICUs/number of ICUs and deaths per million
clearly confirm the Italian government’s responsibility
in the lack of firmness and determination in curbing
the spreading of the pandemic in the Northern regions,
in particular Lombardia. The CoViD-19 occupancy of
ICUs is another important indicator. In Figure 3, we
have chosen the cyan color when this ratio is less than
15%, green between 15% and 30%, yellow between 30%
and 45%, orange between 45% and 60%, and, finally,
red when the ratio is greater than 60%. For the daily
deaths per million, the colored zones were fixed at 2, 4,
6, and 8. At this stage of the outbreak, due to the lack
of pandemic planning and territorial monitoring the
CoViD-19 deaths are obviously underestimated. All
the regions appear in the cyan zone (the only one in
green is Lombardia).
On March 8, the Italian authorities imposed restrictions to Lombardia and some provinces of Emilia Romagna, Marche, Piemonte, and Veneto on March 8 and,
24 hours later, the restrictions were extended to the
entire national territory on March 9. An incomprehensible way of handling the first wave of the pandemic and
leading to panic in the Italian population. From the
data of the second pandemic week (Table 1) graphically shown in Figure 3, it is clear that the containment
measures for regions such as Lombardia (9), Emilia
Romanga (5), Marche (10), Piemonte (14), and Veneto
(21) should have been taken much earlier. This is confirmed 3 weeks later (fifth pandemic week centred at
March 16), when the situation precipitated not only for
the mentioned regions but for all the other Northern
regions. For some regions the 7-day averages of deaths
per million reached scary values: 9-Lombardia (41.1),
20-Val d’Aosta (38.5), 13-P.A. Trento (24.7), 5-Emilia
Romagna (20.1), 8-Liguria (19.1), 10-Marche (19.0),

14-Piemonte (13.2), and 12-P.A. Bolzano (11.0). It is
important to observe that a number of 7-day averages
deaths per million near to 10 means that we have at
least 100 CoViD-19 hospitalized in ICUs per million
of inhabitants and this puts in checkmate most of the
health systems in the world. The main success in tackling the pandemic is to flatten all the pandemic curves
by adopting timely containment measures, by increasing the number of intensive care units, by engaging
new medical staff, by choosing appropriate drugs to
minimize hospitalization, and when possible by using
vaccination. The daily deaths per million for the Northern regions of Italy is a clear evidence of the untimely
action by the authorities and the lack of protocols that
could indicate the right path for people who, remaining
confined at home, could have health problems not only
related to CoViD-19. It is clear that it is easy to judge
the action of the Italian government after observing
and studying the pandemic results, but, with all possible justifications for the unforeseeable situation, it
is also clear that the lack of a pandemic plan and the
delayed action of the authorities played a fundamental
role in the disaster seen in the Northern regions, in
particular in Lombardia.
The word quarantine has its origin in Venice in the
14th century during the Black Death. The city decided
to extend the quarantine period for ships and people
from 30 to 40 days. This was a very important (fortuitous) decision. The incubation period for the bubonic
plague was estimated to be 37 days [17]. The national
quarantine was the only answer found by the Italian
government. The toll that a 10-week block during the
first pandemic wave took on the Italian people was
a very costly one, both from an economic and social
point of view. The Central, Southern regions and Islands were forced to a strict lockdown notwithstanding
the virus had practically arrived not yet entered their
territory (we shall come back to this point later when
we model the pandemic curves of the first wave by
skew-normal distributions). The panic created in the
population led people with CoViD-19 to aggravate
their health before seeking medical treatment and also
created disastrous effects in the prevention of other
diseases.
The deaths in the first half of 2020 could at least have
been honoured if the second wave of the pandemic was
addressed properly. But even when facing the second
wave, the Italian authorities have shown a poor ability
not only in communicating with the population but,
above all, in fighting the pandemic.

III. The 21 pandemic parameters
In the absence of a vaccine or effective drugs treatment,
and because of the still low level of immunity in
the population, a rapid resumption of sustained
transmission may occur in the community (second
wave) once we reduce the containment measures,

ΣδΛ

adopted to tackle the first pandemic wave. Trying
to avoid this, the Minister of Health with a decree
of April 30 [18] indicates the monitoring criteria
that must be followed in order to promptly classify
the pandemic risk and to be able to adopt local
containment measures to face a new outbreak wave.
The monitoring included the following indicators:
6 indicators of data collection capacity (IA);
6 indicators of diagnostic control, investigation and
contact tracing (IB);
9 indicators of transmission stability and resilience
of the health system (IC).
The 21 indicators are explicitly given in Appendix. An
excessive number of indicators, typical of the Italian
bureaucracy, is clearly, independent of their validity
or not, an additional difficulty in monitoring the disease. The regions can probably (but always with great
difficulty) monitor these indicators when the outbreak
gives a respite but clearly 21 indicators cannot be monitored and even more understood by the population
during the worst phase of the pandemic. To understand the great confusion generated in the population
by the Italian authorities population, we recall some of
the incomprehensible decisions taken by the authorities
through dozens and dozens of decrees each of one with
a number of pages between 100 and 150. During the
CoViD-19 crisis, it is necessary to communicate with
the population in a simple, clear, and effective way
exactly the opposite of what the Italian authorities did.
After the first Summer months with open discotheques
and without the need to use personal protective equipment outdoors (in many European countries the use
of mask outdoors was imposed in the beginning of the
reopening period) the Minister of Health on August
16 decides to impose the use of mask outdoors. But,
only from 6pm to 6am of the day later and only when
agglomerations could not be avoided [18]. Certainly a
confused and unclear way of communicating with the
population who clearly do not understand why at 6pm
the use of the mask is triggered and 5 minutes before
it is not. A good example of how authorities shouldn’t
communicate with their own population. Only two
months later, the use of the mask outdoors is compulsory during the whole day, DPMC201013 [8]. The use
of the mask also has a psychological effect, keeping the
attention of the user higher.
Before analysing the measures taken by the Italian
government to face the second pandemic wave, let us
observe the current situation in the pandemic week
number 36 (centred on October 29). In this week the
Italian 7-day average of daily positives and hospitalized
was 761615.0 and 37259.4, respectively, leading to an
hospitalized/positives ratio of approximatively 5% and
a (7-day average) daily deaths per million of 3.5 (the
absolute number was 212.6), see Table 1 and Figure 3.
The daily hospitalized/positives ratio (5%) confirms

S. De Leo and M. P. Araújo [arxiv.org/abs/2102.03373 (q-bio.PE)]

5

that we are already in the second pandemic wave and
the daily deaths near to 4 that we should have already
taken containment measures. In the final sections, we
shall discuss in detail the numerical pandemic criticality
index which permits to correctly classify the risk of each
region. For the moment, let us have a look at the (7-day
average) daily deaths per million of inhabitants. At
week 36: 1-Abruzzo (4.4), 8-Liguria (8,3) , 9-Lombardia
(5.0), 11-Molise (5.7), 12-PA Bolzano (5.1), 13-PA
Trento (4.2), 14-Piemonte (4.4), 16-Sardegna (3.8), 18Toscana (3.9), 19-Umbria (4.9) and 20-Val d’Aosta
(23.8) overcome the national mean, with two regions
(Liguria and Val d’Aosta in a very critical situation).
At November 4, The Minister of Health gave the first
colored classification of the Italian regions [18]. Four
regions appear in the red zone (Lombardia, Piemonte,
Val d’Aosta, and Calabria), two in the orange one
(Puglia e Sicilia), and the remaining regions and
Bolzano and Trento in the yellow zone.

Why the yellow color was assigned to Liguria and to Calabria the red one? In the week before the classification
(week 36), Liguria had a ratio of hospitalized/positive
inhabitants of 976.1/7754.3 ≈ 12.6%, a CoViD-19 ICUs
occupancy rate of 51.3/209 ≈ 24.5%, and a (7-day average) daily deaths per million of 12.9/1.543 ≈ 8.4 (the
difference from 8.3 which appears in Table 1 and used
in our previous discussion is due to the approximation done in 12.9). In the same week, the hospitalized/positive ratio, the ICUs rate, and the daily deaths
per million for Calabria were 143.1/2737.6 ≈ 5.2%,
9.6/152 ≈ 6.3%, and 1.6/1.925 ≈ 0.8.
From the data of Table 1 and their graphical presentation in Figure 3, the best numbers belong to Calabria.
This region was the first one to be put in the red zone
and never it was collocated in the yellow one. For
Veneto, it was always determined the yellow zone. See
the following picture.

ΣδΛ

Let us examine, its number in week 39 (centred at
November 19) and 42 (December 10). The CoViD19 ICUs rate passed from 32.8% to 40.2% and the
daily deaths from 9.1 to 17.2. Nothing was done to
really face the spreading of the disease in this region
(remember that the yellow zone is the lighter pandemic
risk zone). Consequently, in the last week of the year,
we find Veneto in a very scary situation with a CoViD19 ICUs rate of 44.1% and a (7-day average) daily
deaths per million of 21.1.
The great confusion in determining the pandemic
gravity by the Italian authorities was the initial motivation of our work. In this paper we aim to propose
a numerical index of pandemic criticality weighted by
a few effective parameters: The ratio of new infected
people over new tested cases, the number of hospitalized per million of inhabitants, the CoViD-19 ICUs
rate, and, finally, the daily deaths per million.

IV. Skew normal distributions
In studying the CoViD-19 data, we must use two distinct approaches [19,20]. First, until reaching the curve
peak, we have to model the data by a Gaussian distri-

bution [21]. Once the peak has been reached, we have
to introduce a parameter which models the asymmetry
of the curve. In this case the skew-Gaussian distributions [22–25] come into play. The explicit analytical
formula of the skew probabilities density functions,
used in this paper to fit the Italian pandemic curves
of the pandemic first wave, is given by

the NonlinearModelFit of the computational program

total confirmed cases and deaths, for daily positives,
hospitalized, and hospitalized in ICUs are found in
Table 2.

In order to optimize the graphical presentation of
the pandemic data, we have decided to normalise the
total confirmed cases and deaths to those of Lombardia.
At the sixteenth pandemic week (centred on June 6),
Lombardia (number 9 in the plots) reached 90979.7
(7-day average) total confirmed cases and 16374.9 (7day average) total deaths. Numbers that, considering
the population of 10.104 M, lead to 9004.3 confirmed
cases per million of inhabitants and 1620.6 deaths per
million. For Lombardia, we used the scale factor 1000.

The scale factors can also be used to determine the
regional colors for the total confirmed cases and deaths
of the first pandemic wave: cyan at 150, green at 300,
yellow at 450, orange at 600, red at 1000, with a proportional color gradation between two colors. Looking at
the total confirmed cases per million of inhabitants: 7
regions appear in the cyan zone, 5 of which (Basilicata,
Calabria, Campania, Sardegna, and Sicilia) with a
scale factor of deaths per million less than 100 and two
of which (Lazio and Puglia) with a number between
100 and 150, and 2 regions (Molise and Umbria) in
the green zone. For the total deaths per million of
inhabitants, we have 9 regions in the cyan zone, all of
them (Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Lazio, Molise,
Puglia, Sardegna, Sicilia, and Sardegna) with a scale
factor less than 100, and 4 regions in the green zone
(Abruzzo, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Toscana, and Veneto).
From Figure 4 and 5, it is clear that the critical numbers belong to the Northern regions with the exception
of Friuli Venezia Giulia and Veneto.

The skew-Gaussian distributions (blue, gray, and
white lines) show an excellent agreement with the
pandemic data (colored, gray, and white histograms).
The fitting parameters can then be used to compare
different regions and, for the same region, to compare
positives, hospitalized, and hospitalized in the intensive
care units data. It is also important to note that the
gradation of colors in the pandemic curves of confirmed
cases and deaths gives us an idea of the temporal
evolution in each region. Normalisation is always done
with respect to Lombardia.
In Lombardia, for the first pandemic wave, the mortality rate seems to be 1.6/9=17.8%. It is obvious
that this rate cannot be the real infection fatality rate
(IFR) of Sars-CoV2 because 17.8% is calculated by
using the number of known confirmed cases and not
the number of real infected people. In an interesting
study done in a small German town, of 919 individuals
15.53% were infected. By applying this infection rate
to the total population in the community, i.e. 12597,
we can estimate 1956 (real) infected people. Having 7
Sars-CoV2 deaths reported by the local authorities, the
real IFR can be estimated to be 7/1956 =0.36% [28].
By using the infection rate of 15% in Lombardia, we
should have, during the first wave, 1.5 million of infected people. This means a factor 16.7 with respect to
the number of confirmed cases reported by the local
authorities. In this case, the real IFR for Lombardia is
found around 1%. Lower than 17.8% but still greater
than 0.36%. Observe that a factor 2.5 in the total
deaths implies 16000 instead of 6400 deaths. This high
IFR, very close to the one found for Bergamo [14], is
clearly due to the confusion generated in the population and to the lack of a national pandemic plan. In
a panic situation, people to do not seek medical help
at the right time and, in many cases, this aggravates
their health conditions generating a difficult situation
to be managed by the medical staff. We also remember that during the first wave, the Lombardia elderly
homes were even used to accommodate patients with
CoViD-19. An incomprehensible choice that brought
the the virus to the most fragile age range with obvious
dramatic consequences. In the Northern regions the
containment measures were adopted too late, but this
was not the only cause of the disaster. The enormous
difficulties in which health professionals worked clearly
show, as observed in the excellent report by Zambon
et al. [10], the lack of a pandemic plan. The World
Health Organization was accused of conspiring with
the Italian authorities to remove the Zambon’s report
revealing the mismanagement of Italian government
at the beginning of the CoViD-19 pandemic. In the
102-page report, the authors observed that the national
pandemic plan had not been updated since 2006 and
that, due to being unprepared, the initial response
from hospitals was improvised, chaotic, and creative.
For the Southern regions, where the virus had not yet
arrived or had only reached a minimum extent and

ΣδΛ

therefore could be controlled with targeted measures,
the lockdown was identical to that adopted for the
Northern regions. As we will see later, things have
not changed much when the second pandemic wave
arrived. A shame for the Italian government and a
sadness for its population who certainly did not deserve such treatment and who, contrary to what the
national authorities did, responded with discipline and
determination in the months of March, April, and May.
The pandemic curves were controlled by the discipline
and determination of the Italian population and by the
heroic work of health professionals which compensated
for the confusion and the incompetence and the lack
of programming of the Italian authorities which found
in a medieval lockdown the only answer to the first
wave of pandemic.

V. The four pandemic parameters
In this Section, we turn our attention on 4 pandemic
parameters: New confirmed cases over new tested
people, hospitalized and hospitalized in ICUs per million of inhabitants, and ,finally, daily deaths. The first
parameter is the one used to determine the infection
reproduction number, but this cannot be the only parameter to be observed, as the other 3 parameters can
be more effective in understanding the real situation
of the pandemic.
CoViD-19 tests can be useful to reduce the virus
diffusion by using timely preventive isolation measures
and by monitoring close contacts of infected people.
Before discussing the importance of a massive testing
strategy, let us see which types of tests are currently
being used [29]. The most effective test to detect the
presence of the Sars-CoV-2 virus is the one based on
the molecular analysis. This test has been used in
Italy to identify people who have contracted the virus.
Once a person carrying the virus has been identified,
it is clear that a first measure is the isolation of the
same and, once isolated, the local authorities have to
check his close contacts. Digital proximity tracking
tools are used to widen the network of possible contacts. The effectiveness of such digital tools clearly
depends on a high coverage and utilization rate among
the population. National lockdown during the first
pandemic wave, lack of a pandemic plan, confusion,
bad communication, and questionable choices in the
reopening period (such as the non-obligation to wear
a mask outdoors) led the population to underestimate
the possibility of a second pandemic wave. The contact
tracing app suggested by the Italian government was,
due to the very low acceptance within the population,
practically useless. The lack of an effective network
of regional contact tracing led to the collapse when
the pandemic began to spread within the territory.
Without a massive testing strategy and without an
effective contact tracing is clear that many asymptomatic people will never be identified. In addition to

the molecular test, other tests should have been employed: The quick swab antigen test, the classic and
rapid serological test, and the salivary test. For the
quick swab antigen test, the sample collection methods
are similar to those of molecular tests (nasopharyngeal
swab). This test has a lower sensitivity but it allows
to identify the antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a
very short time (about 15 minutes). The serological (or
immunological) test detects the presence of specific antibodies that the immune system produces in response
to infection (IgA, IgM and IgG) and their quantity in
the blood. They tell us if we have contracted the virus
and for how long. This test requires a venous blood
sample, and is carried out in specialized laboratories.
The rapid serological test is based on the same principle as the classic one, but it only tells us whether or
not specific antibodies for the virus are present in the
body. The average response time is about 15 minutes
and can also be done outside the laboratories. Serological tests, by their nature, are unable to tell whether
the patient has an ongoing infection, but only whether
or not he has come into contact with the virus. They
can therefore provide useful information to understand
how many people have come into contact with the
virus (stratify them by age and geographical region)
and to determine if a natural (herd) immunity has
been achieved. Salivary collection is simpler and less
invasive than nasopharyngeal swab or blood sampling.
This type of test assesses the presence of the virus in
the body and it could be very useful for screening large
numbers of people. So, when performed on a recurring
basis (every 72 hours), it could allow for rapid isolation and outbreak control decisions. This test is, for
example, very important in reopening schools.
The choice to do not prioritize a massive use of tests
for screening was certainly one of the problems regarding the territorial pandemic control, unfortunately, it
was not the only mistake. In the beginning of a pandemic, having a few number of infected, the differences
between new tests done and new people tested is so
small to be practically insignificant. Once the pandemic is spreading enough in the territory, the rate of
new cases over new tests done (see the regional white
histograms in Figure 6) can lead to wrong conclusions.
What is to be considered, it is the number of new cases
over the number of new people tested (blue histograms
in Figure 6).
Let us consider an explicit example to understand
the great confusion created by Italian authorities when
looking at the pandemic data and in the communication with the population. First of all, let us show
the importance of using weekly averages instead of
daily data. At November 29, Puglia had the following daily numbers: 907 (53218-52311) new confirmed
cases and 8285 (780364-772079) new tests done. From
these data, the daily infection rate communicated to
the population was 10.9%. On day later, Puglia had
1102 (54320-53218) new cases with 4151 (7845515-

ΣδΛ

780364) new tests done and, consequently, an infection
rate of 26.5%. This frightening leap get into panic
midia and population. It is clear that a 7-day average,
it is a more appropriate way to treat the pandemic
data. By using, the 7-day averages, the rate passes
from 15.9%, (53218-43507)/(780364-719303), to 16.0%,
(54320-44487)/(784515-61434), see the Puglia white
histogram at the week 40 in Figure 6. After understanding that in the communication with the population is
better used 7-day average, let us now analyse which
was the mistake done by the Italian authorities in facing the second pandemic wave. As observed before,
to calculate the real infection rate, we have to use the
number of new tested people and not the number of
new tests. By using the number of new tested people,
we find 30.2%, (53218-43507)/(538195-506049), and
29.3%, (54320-44487)/(541174-507599), see the Puglia
blue histogram at the week 40 in Figure 6. The estimation of the correct infection rate is fundamental to
understand in which stage the pandemic is. An artificial reduction in the infection rate not only creates the
problem of not having the real picture of the infected
in the territory but also creates another even more
serious problem which is the artificial reduction of the
pandemic reproduction factor, obtained by analysing
the growth of the infection rate.
Looking at Figure 6, the difference between white
and blue histograms is evident for 5-Emilia Romagna,
6-Friuli Venezia Giulia, 9-Lombardia, 8-Liguria, 12P.A. Bolzano, 13-P.A. Trento, 20-Veneto, and 21-Val
d’ Aosta: 8 of the 9 regions (with deaths per million
greater than 1300) which appear in the top of the table
given in Figure 2. Piemonte local authorities used, in
addition to molecular tests, serological tests. This
obviously reduces the infection rate. As previously
observed such tests do not give information on the
patient’s current state of infection. The number of serological tests was removed later, see the Piemonte plot
in Figure 6 at the pandemic week number 43 (centred
at December 17). Once again an incomprehensible
choice, in this case done by the local authorities which
did not follow the indication given by the national ones.
The difference between the white and blue histograms
is almost non-existent for 2-Basilicata, 3-Calabria, 4Campania, 11-Molise, and 16-Sardegna, very small
for 17-Sicilia, and small for 7-Lazio and 15-Puglia.
A minimal difference between the two curves clearly
shows the local capacity to control the spreading of
the pandemic.
Studying the pandemic reproduction factor is certainly one of the main objectives in facing an outbreak,
but a correct analysis requires to know the number of
new people tested by a molecular analysis. Looking at
Figure 6, it is incomprehensible how Veneto was always
placed in the area of low pandemic hazard zone (yellow) and Calabria placed, at November 4, in the one of
greatest pandemic danger (red) and then, at November 27, in the medium risk (orange) never reached the

yellow classification. The infection rate is surely one
of the first parameter to be investigated and it could
play a fundamental role in a timely anticipation of the
territorial spreading of the virus. Nevertheless, three
others parameters are of great importance when facing
the outbreak: Hospitalized per Million of Inhabitants
(pMoI), hospitalized in ICUs pMoI, and, finally deaths
pMoI. The detailed study of these 3 pandemic parameters is the subject matter of the next section and
leads, together with the confirmed over tested ratio,
to the introduction of a numerical pandemic criticality
index.
When discussing the relationship between new confirmed cases and new tested people, we used 5 colored
zones: up to 10% (cyan), between 10% and 20% (green),
between 20% and 30% (yellow), between 30% and 40%
(orange), and, finally, greater than 40% (red), see Figure 5. Let us now determine the criticality of the
colored areas for hospitalized and hospitalized in ICUs.
For the hospitalized in ICUs, the pandemic critical
areas have been determined by taking into account
the total number of ICU beds available in each region.
Observing that part of the beds must be reserved for
non CoVid-19 patients, the begin of the red zone was
fixed at 60% of occupancy. The least criticality areas
are then found between 45 % and 60% (orange), 30%
and 45% (yellow), 15% and 30% (green), and, finally,
below 15% (cyan). In facing the second pandemic wave,
regions have increased their capacity for ICU beds: 3Calabria 152 ICUs (an increase of 4.8%), 9-Lombardia
983 (14.2%), 15-Puglia 366 (20.4%), and 21-Veneto
825 (67.0%). Considering their different populations
(1.925 M, 10.104 M, 4.008 M, and 4.907 M) we thus
have 79.0, 97.3, 91.3, and 168.1 ICUs per million of
inhabitants. The colored zone of criticality are then
found at (11.9, 23.7, 31.6, and 47.4) for Calabria, (14.6,
29.2, 39.9, and 58.4) for Lombardia, (13.7, 27.4, 36.5,
and 54.8) for Puglia, and (25.2, 50.4, 67.2, and 100.9)
for Veneto, see Figure 8.
During the first pandemic wave the most affected
region showed a factor 10 of proportionality between
hospitalized and hospitalized in ICUs (see for example
the gray histograms of 5-Emilia Romagna, 8-Liguria,
9-Lombardia, and 14-Piemonte in Figure 7 and 8).
The criticality zones for hospitalized people were thus
obtained from the ones of hospitalized in ICUs by using
a factor 10.
In Figure 9, we find the (7-day average) daily deaths
for million of inhabitants with colors bands fixed at
2, 4, 6, and 8. To control the pandemic curves the
daily deaths should not exceed 5 deaths per million of
inhabitants. For one death, we approximatively find
50 hospitalized in ICUs and this mean an occupancy
of 30% for a country with 150 IUCs per million of
inhabitants (the number suggested by the WHO).

ΣδΛ

VI. The pandemic criticality index
The use of colors to graphically show the territorial
pandemic criticality is understandable: Colored maps
allow to immediately recognize which areas are in a critical situation. Nevertheless, the colored zones should
always be accompanied by their corresponding numerical pandemic criticality index. Going from one color
to another is like making a quantum leap and it could
even create confusion in the population. A number
could better explain the evolution of the pandemic
criticality in a given area. In this Section, we will see
how, by using the four parameters given in the previous Section, it is possible to introduce a numerical
index of pandemic criticality.
Let us consider the following five criticality zones
with the corresponding numerical index interval:
•
•
•
•
•

high
very high

risk

-

[0,1) ,
[1,2) ,
[2,3) ,
[3,4) ,
[4,∞) .

The 7-day average infection rate bands are at 10%, 20%,
30%, and 40% (see Figure 6). So, the first normalised
parameter to be used in calculating the numerical
pandemic criticality is
ρ1 =

1 new confirmed cases
.
10% new tested people

(5)

The ratio of 7-day average hospitalized and hospitalized
in ICUs over the available ICUs in each region are
characterized by the following critical values: 150%,
300%, 400%, 600% (Figure 7), and 15%, 30%, 40%,
60% (Figure 8). In this case, we introduce the following
two normalised parameters
ρ2

=

1 hospitalized
,
150%
ICUs
(6)

ρ3

=

1 hospitalized in ICUs
.
15%
ICUs

Finally, the bands for the 7-day average daily deaths
per million of inhabitants are found at 2, 4, 6, and 8.
Consequently, the last normalised parameter is given
by
1
ρ4 =
daily deaths per million .
(7)

These 4 numerical parameters can be then weighed,
leading to the numerical pandemic criticality index
pcia,b,c,d

(8)

In Figure 10, we plot the numerical index for
(a,b,c,d)=(1,1,1,1) and (1,2,3,4), see white lines. In the

10

same Figure, we also find the mean criticality index
pci =

( pci1,1,1,1 + pci1,2,3,4 ) / 2 ,

(9)

see the blue dots in Figure 10. In Table 3, we give, for
each region, the pandemic criticality index corresponding to the last 15 pandemic weeks of 2020: From week
31 (centred at September 24) to week 45 (centred at
December 31). In Figure 10 and Table 3, we also associate a gradation of colors to facilitate the graphical
presentation of the pandemic criticality index.
By using the numerical pandemic criticality index,
we can also check the containment measures adopted by
the Italian government. At the beginning of November,
the Italian authorities divided the national territory
into 3 pandemic risk areas: Yellow, orange and red
areas with corresponding containment measures. Yellow area: Curfew from 10pm to 5am of the following
day, public transport with 50% of occupancy, distance
learning for high schools and face-to-face for middle
and elementary schools, shopping centres closed on
weekends (with the exception of pharmacies, tobacco
shops, newspapers stands), bars and restaurants closing at 6pm. Orange area: to the containment measures
of the yellow area we have to add the closing of bars
and restaurants and prohibition of travel between different municipalities. Red area: prohibition of any
type of movement if not justified.
The first classification done by the Italian authorities
(November 4) determines the red zone for Piemonte,
Lombardia, Val d’Aosta and Calabria, the orange one
for Puglia and Sicilia, and the yellow area for all the
other regions and the two autonomous provinces of
Bolzano and Trento. Looking at Table 3, we observe
that, at week 36 (centred at October 29) 3-Calabria
had a numerical pandemic index of 0.53 (the best
one in Italy) and 2 regions had an index greater than
3 (8-Liguria, 3.15, and 20-Val d’Aosta, 6.24). The
Italian authorities determine the zone of Calabria to
be red and the one of Liguria to be yellow. In the
same Table, we also find that 21-Veneto, 1.34, and
15-Puglia had practically the same pandemic index.
One week later, Liguria turns into an orange zone. The
new containment measures allowed to stop and the
reduce its numerical pandemic index, see the pandemic
week 39 (centred at November 19). For Veneto, always
yellow zone, the pandemic index will increase during
the following week reaching 6.14 at the last week of
the year. Calabria never exceeds 2 (one of the best
result in Italy) but it is one of the first regions to
be classified as a red area and only at December 5
is turned into an orange zone. By comparing the
pandemic criticality index given in Table 3 with the
risk classification assigned by the Italian authorities
discussed in Section 3, the reader will find many other
inconsistencies.

ΣδΛ

VII. Conclusions
The infection reproduction number (IRN) is only one
of the parameter to be checked and probably the one
most problematic. In the first wave of the pandemic
the number of tested people worldwide was often not
a reliable number, this implied a wide and sometimes
embarrassing IRN range. During the second pandemic
wave, the number of tests made has certainly become
more reliable but as we have seen in this article, in
Italy the tests made were used instead of the new
tested people. It is clear that monitoring the territorial
increase of the infection is essential to prevent the diffusion, but once the pandemic spreads on the territory
other parameters are important to determine the appropriate containment measures. If a region, due to
a precarious health system or to lack of heath professionals, is, for example, unable to treat patients, it is
clear that, independently of its infection reproduction
number, containment measures must be taken. Hospitalized, hospitalized in ICUs, and, obviously, daily
deaths must not only be monitored systematically but
also weighed appropriately. The use of a numerical
pandemic criticality index based on few and effective
parameters can also be easily understood by population and media. Another important point is that, by
using a numerical range instead of color bands, we can
better differentiate the criteria of social distancing.

Appendix
The list of 21 indicators for the pandemic risk control
established by the ministerial decree of April 30 [18].
(IA)
1) Number of symptomatic cases notified per month
for which the starting date of symptoms is indicated
over the total symptomatic cases notified to the surveillance system in the same period;
2) Number of cases notified per month with a history
of hospital admission, in wards other than intensive
care, for which the date of admission is indicated over
the total of cases with a history of hospital admission,
in wards other than intensive care, notified to the to
the surveillance system in the same period;
3) Number of cases notified per month with a history
of transfer/admission to the ICU for which the date
of transfer/admission is indicated over the total of
cases with a history of transfer/admission to the ICU
notified to the surveillance system;
4) Number of cases notified per month for which the
municipality of domicile or residence is reported over
the total number of cases notified to the surveillance
system in the same period;
5) Number of checklists administered weekly to residential and health care facilities (optional);
6) Number of residential and health care facilities
that respond to the checklist on a weekly basis with
at least one criticality found (optional);

14) Rt calculated on the basis of integrated ISS
surveillance (two indicators, based on the symptom
start and hospitalization dates, are used).
15) Number of cases reported to Covid-net sentinel
surveillance per week (optional).
16) Number of cases by diagnosis date and symptom
onset date reported to integrated Covid surveillance
per day.
17) Number of new transmission outbreaks (2 or
more epidemiologically linked cases or an unexpected
increase in the number of cases in a defined time and
place).
18) Number of new cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection per region not associated with known transmission chains.
19) Number of accesses to the emergency room with
ICD-9 classification compatible with syndromic pictures attributable to Covid-19 (optional)
20) Occupancy rate of total intensive care beds (code
49) for Covid patients.
21) Occupancy rate of total medical area beds for
Covid patients.

(IB)
7) Percentage of positive swabs, excluding as far as
possible all screening activities and re-testing of the
same subjects, overall and by macro-setting (territorial,
emergency room/hospital, other) per month.
8) Time between symptom onset date and diagnosis
date.
9) Time between symptom onset date and isolation
date (optional).
10) Number, type of professional figures and time
over the total number of people dedicated to contacttracing in each territorial service.
11) Number, type of professional figures and time
over the total of people dedicated in each territorial
service to the activities of sampling/sending to the
reference laboratories and monitoring of close contacts
and cases placed respectively in quarantine and isolation.
12) Number of confirmed cases of infection in the
Region for which a regular epidemiological investigation was carried out with the search for close contacts,
out of the total of new confirmed cases of infection.
(IC)
13) Number of cases reported to the Civil Protection
in the last 14 days.
