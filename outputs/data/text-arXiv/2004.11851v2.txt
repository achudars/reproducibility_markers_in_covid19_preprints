1. Abstract
Objective: Rapid testing is paramount during a pandemic to prevent continued viral
spread and excess morbidity and mortality. This study investigates whether testing strategies based on sample pooling can increase the speed and throughput of screening for
SARS-CoV-2, especially in resource-limited settings.
Methods: In a mathematical modelling approach conducted in May 2020, six different
testing strategies were simulated based on key input parameters such as infection rate,
test characteristics, population size, and testing capacity. The situations in five countries
were simulated, reflecting a broad variety of population sizes and testing capacities. The
primary study outcome measurements were time and number of tests required, number
of cases identified, and number of false positives.
Findings: The performance of all tested methods depends on the input parameters, i.e.
the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. To screen one tenth of each country’s
population at an infection rate of 1%, realistic optimised testing strategies enable such a
campaign to be completed in ca. 29 days in the US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in
Italy, and 10 in Germany. This is ca. eight times faster compared to individual testing.
When infection rates are lower, or when employing an optimal, yet more complex pooling
method, the gains are more pronounced. Pool-based approaches also reduce the number
of false positive diagnoses by a factor of up to 100.
Conclusions: The results of this study provide a rationale for adoption of pool-based
testing strategies to increase speed and throughput of testing for SARS-CoV-2, hence
saving time and resources compared with individual testing.
2. Introduction
Pandemics such as COVID-19 pose a significant public health threat, leading to morbidity, mortality, and rapid and significant strain on the health system. 1 Faced with the
global spread of a novel pathogen, the identification of cases and carriers and elucidation
of transmission patterns is paramount. 2,3 The ability to rapidly and reliably diagnose
those infected is critical to 1) identify and control clusters of infection; 2) prepare the
health system for the patient numbers to be expected; 3) deploy medical countermeasures
in a targeted way; and 4) assess the effectiveness of any public health measures and adapt
them accordingly. 4
The speed of testing is critical, but is limited by supply of and access to diagnostic tests,
logistical challenges, and shortages in qualified personnel and/or laboratory facilities that
could perform the necessary tests. 5,6
In each of the above scenarios, maximising the number of people that can be tested in a
given time is essential. Universal weekly testing has been proposed as the only viable exit
strategy from lockdown. 7–9,5,10,11 One potential approach of increasing testing efficiency is
pooling of different samples in one test. This is a well-validated method used for example
in transfusion medicine for HIV testing and has recently been experimentally deployed
for SARS-CoV-2 in a small-scale study in California. 12,13

3

Using a simulation approach, this study aims to identify the most effective testing
strategy by comparing six mathematical procedures for mass testing a given population
for infection with SARS-CoV-2. The primary objective thereby is to identify as many cases
as possible as quickly as possible with a given limited testing capacity. In other words,
we aim to deploy the available tests as effectively as possible, increasing the number of
identified cases per test (ICPT).
3. Methods
Assumptions. We simulate a screening campaign aimed at an entire population assuming a range of different possible infection rates ir (including unreported cases).
We assume a testing capacity of c (e.g. PCR-based) tests per day, and that each test
5
takes 5 hours to process in a clinical laboratory, resulting in a capacity of c 24
tests in parallel. For reasons of consistency, sample logistics are not included as an input parameter.
In terms of test characteristics we assume a sensitivity of p = 0.99 based on data
reported by LabCorp to the FDA and an estimated false-positive rate of q = 0.01. 14 We
assume the test characteristics to remain constant after pooling, based on a maximum
pool size of k = 32 which has been shown to provide reliable results for COVID-19. 15,16
To account for the case of a potential drop in sensitivity due to sample pooling via a
dilution effect, we duplicated all analyses with a decreased sensitivity of p = 0.75. These
data can be found in the supplementaries in S1 and S2.
In the following section, we provide on overview of the different pooling strategies. Critically, in this article we address the specific scenario of a mass screening campaign of an
entire population, which during the course of a pandemic likely will have to be repeated
several times. In this scenario - and especially in the case of an emerging pathogen -, it
can be assumed that neither the number of test kits nor the logistics available would be
sufficient for individual testing. These assumptions are also supported by our calculations
presented in the Results section. Given the explicit goal of this study, focusing on sensitivity and specificity alone provides an incomplete picture as it ignores an urgent public
health priority, which is mass testing of sufficiently large parts of the population. This
study therefore employs “confirmed cases per test” as main parameter for optimisation.
It follows the general idea that if we cannot find all cases in a screening campaign, then we
should still aim to find as many cases as possible using all test kits available in a certain
time period.
Given the nature of the work, the study was exempted from ethics approval.
Testing strategies. We summarise the methods and illustrate them in Fig 1.
Individual testing: The conventional approach of testing every person in a given population individually.
2-level pooling: Following a recent preprint by Hanel and Thurner we define a maximum
pool size k. If the pooled test is positive, every sample in that pool is tested
individually. 17 Specifically, if the first level test of the entire pool is negative, then
the whole pool is cleared, without need for individual testing. This procedure was
first introduced by Dorfman in 1943 and improved by Sterret in 1957. 18,19

Figure 1. An illustration of finding cases in a pool Demonstrated for
a pool of eight samples for individual testing (A), 2-level pooling (B), binary
splitting (C), and Sobel-R1 (F). For recursive binary splitting (D), we show
part of the search tree highlighting the difference to binary splitting. For
Purim (E), we show the search for three cases in an overall set of 82 = 64,
starting from 16 pools of size eight (i.e. 8 horizontal and 8 vertical in a
matrix arrangement) before testing the cross-sections.

Binary splitting: A well-known hierarchical multi-layer procedure: if a test of a pool
size k is positive, the pool is split in two sets of size k/2, and a pooled test is
performed on the two new sets. 20 If a pool is tested negative, it is cleared and no
further tests are performed on the samples in this pool. This procedure is repeated
recursively for those subsets with a positive (pooled) test until each individual case
has been identified.
Optimised recursive binary splitting: A recent variation of binary splitting: if at a
given level of the hierarchy only one pool tests positive, then the identification of a
particular case continues via a binary search. Afterwards, all confirmed positive or
confirmed negative samples are removed from the pool and the procedure continues

5

with the remaining subjects in the unified pool. 21 We improved the method by
choosing optimal initial pool sizes based on the infection rate.
Each level of the optimised recursive binary splitting (oRBS) procedure is executed as follows:
(1) Starting with a pool P of (optimised) size k and testing the entire pool, unless
it is know from a previous step of the algorithm that P must contain a positive
sample.
(2) If P is tested positive, then it is split into partitions P1 and P2 and tests are
performed on these two new pools.
(3) If both P1 and P2 are positive, the oRBS algorithm is run recursively on P1
and P2 . If only one partition, say P1 , tests positive, then all individuals in P2
are identified as healthy and a binary splitting subprocedure is run on P1 .
The purpose of this refinement step is to identify a single case in the pool P1
and to remove this case along with any individuals that have been identified
as healthy.
(4) Finally, we run the oRBS algorithm recursively on all remaining samples in
P1 .
Consider the example step in Fig 1(D). The starting point is a positive sample
pool P1 of size k = 8 from a previous oRBS step. Executing the binary subprocedure to identify a first case in P1 , the pool is split into two subpools S1 and S2
of size 4. To identify this case, it is sufficient to perform a test on one of the subpools. In our example, the tested subpool S1 contains one case, leading to another
binary split. Only one of the resulting pools S1,1 and S1,2 of size 2 is tested. S1,1 is
identified as positive and split into two single samples. One of these two samples
is tested negative, implying that the second sample has to be positive.
At this point we have identified one case and one healthy individual in the pool
P1 . Removing these two individuals, the oRBS algorithm is performed analogously
on the remaining six samples in P1 until all cases in P1 have been identified.
Purim: A matrix-based pooling approach where one-dimensional overlapping pools are
arranged in a matrix, and only cross-sections of pools that have tested positive are
tested individually. 22
In the example illustrated in Fig 1(E), we consider a set of 64 individuals to be
tested and choose a fixed pool size of k = 8. The samples are arranged into a 8 × 8
matrix and the eight pools formed by the columns of this matrix are tested. As
a next step, the eight pools formed by the rows of the matrix are tested, followed
by individual tests on samples where both column and row have tested positive.
We only consider Purim’s 2D variant and neglect the 3D variant; the latter
becomes impractical for low infection rates, requiring handling of up to 323 =
32, 768 samples simultaneously.
Sobel-R1: A decision tree approach based on the assumption of a binomial distribution
of the test results. Pool sizes are adapted according to the minimisation of the
expected number of remaining tests. 20

This approach assumes that all n individuals to be tested are partitioned into
(at most) two sets; a set of size m ≥ 0 containing at least one person that is known
to be infected, and a binomial set of size n − m ≥ 0. Denote by q the probability
of being tested negative and by k the next pool size we need to determine. The
expected number of pooled tests remaining to be performed for a set of size m and
a binomial set of size n − m is given recursively by

G(0, n) = 1 + min q k G(0, n − k) + (1 − q k )G(k, n) ,
1≤k≤n

for m = 0, and

G(m, n) = 1 + min

for n ≥ m ≥ 2, with boundary conditions
G(0, 0) = 0,
G(1, n) = G(0, n − 1)

for

n = 1, 2, . . . .

Thus, we can determine the size of the next pool by computing the expected
number of remaining tests.
If the infection rate is known, it can be shown that this approach is a stochastically optimal search variant and therefore serves as an upper bound for the number
of cases correctly identified per test.
In the example depicted in Fig 1(F), we start with a pool size 8 with an infection
rate p = 0.25 = 1 − q. Computing G(0, 8) yields k = 8, and as a first step the
entire pool is tested. Since the test is positive, we continue by computing G(8, 8)
and inferring that we need to choose k = 4 as the size of the next pool to be tested.
This procedure is repeated until the end of the branch, i.e. until a single sample
needs to be tested. All samples that have not yet been classified are now collected
in a new pool, which in our example has size 6. Since computing G(0, 6) yields
k = 6, the entire pool is tested. The result is positive, so we compute G(6, 6) and
continue analogously to the procedure as described for the previous branch.
The algorithm ends once all samples in the initial pool have been classified as
positive or have been found to be negative.
Implementation and statistics. Samples within the virtual populations are designated
as positive randomly using Python’s numpy random number generator in accordance with
the specified infection rate. To account for randomness and to obtain robust results, we
simulate in repetitions of ten and then calculate the expectation value and standard
deviation.
For all pooling approaches we limit the maximum pool size to 32 which was shown to be
a viable upper limit enabling pool-based testing without a significant loss of sensitivity. 15,16
However, for increasing infection rates, smaller pool sizes result in more cases identified
per test, which means the initial pool size can be optimised, see e.g. Hanel and Thurner
and Xiong et al. 17,23 We optimise the pool size for each testing strategy and infection
rate using a test population of 50, 000 individuals using every pool size in {1, . . . , 32}.

7

The optimal pool size is the one leading to the fastest screening of the test population.
It is calculated once, stored, and then reused for the appropriate combination of testing
method and infection rate.
As shown in Fig 2, the optimal pool size for each method in terms of lowest expected
time to test an entire population depends on the infection rate. For an infection rate
ir=1%, the expected total time decreases with increasing pool size for all pooling methods
except 2-level pooling. For increasing infection rates, the optimal pool size decreases for all
pooling methods but Sobel-R1, and eventually approaches pool size 1 and thus individual
testing.

infection rate, here for ir=1%, 10%, 20%. For low infection rates, all
methods but 2-level pooling prefer pool sizes that are as large as possible.
With increasing infection rate, the optimal pool size decreases – with the
exception of the Sobel-R1 method – until they approach pool size 1. Parameters: sensitivity p = 0.99, false positive rate q = 0.01, population 50, 000,

4. Results
This study employs six different methods to model the most effective strategy to screen
a given population within the shortest time and with the smallest number of tests possible.
Since the choice of ideal testing strategy depends on the input parameters (such as size
and infection rate of a population, test sensitivity, etc.), the models we developed can be
fully customised and run via

enabling the reader to find the best possible strategy for their specific needs.

Fig 3(A) compares the effectiveness in terms of ICPT for all methods for different
infection rates under the assumptions given in the Methods section. Sobel-R1 is the
optimal method and provides a theoretical upper bound for the achievable ICPT. However,
this method is restricted in its practical applicability (see below). For an infection rate of
1%, the hierarchical approaches such as binary and recursive binary splitting show almost
an eight and ten fold ICPT increase compared to the current status quo of individual
testing respectively, enabling the testing of large groups with a single test. Disregarding
Sobel-R1, we obtain the following results: for infection rates up to 6%, recursive binary
splitting is the optimal method. For infection rates up to 2.5%, the next best option is
binary splitting, and for infection rates between 2.5% and 6%, the next best method is
the matrix-based Purim method. For infection rates between 6% and 12%, Purim is the
optimal method. For infection rates of 12% and higher, 2-level pooling with optimised
pool sizes yields the highest ICPT. Of note, the current standard approach of individual
testing is never found to be the best choice in the scenarios we modelled.

Figure 3. Screening the whole population. Parameters: sensitivity
p = 0.99, false positive rate q = 0.01, test duration 5h, averaged over 10
runs. Optimal (max.) pool size each (c.f. Fig 2); for ir=1% as in (B)–(D)
we obtain individual testing: 1; 2-level pooling: 12; binary splitting: 32;
recursive binary splitting: 32; Purim: 32, Sobel-R1: 31.
To better examine the potential of hierarchical approaches, we deployed our models to
simulate the situation for five countries: the US, the UK, Germany, Italy, and Singapore;
see Table 1. We assume that as of May 2020 ir = 1% of the population is infected.
Fig 3(B) shows the overall time required to test the whole population in each of the five
countries. Even in Germany, which has the highest relative testing capacity per day of
these five countries, it would take 675 days with the current screening approach (individual
testing) to test every individual; the US on the other hand would require 2,244 days. For
the US, binary splitting reduces the time required to 285 days (about 9.5 months), and the
optimised recursive binary splitting to 232 days. If only one tenth of the population needs
to undergo screening – e.g. when prioritising frontline medical staff and public workers –
then this would mean such a campaign could be completed with binary splitting in about
29 days in the US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy, and 10 in Germany. When
the infection rates are considerably lower, or when employing an optimal, yet logistically
more challenging, pooling method, the gains are more pronounced. With Sobel-R1, the
same screening campaign could be completed in 21 days in the US, 52 in the UK, 18 in
Singapore, 12 in Italy, and 7 in Germany. As a case study, we conducted a comparison
using the six approaches for three different infection rates for the US, see Table 2.
It is important to note that a screening campaign based on a hierarchical approach on
average identifies fewer cases than individual testing. Assuming a test sensitivity of 0.99
for an individual test, employing hierarchical testing has a probability of 0.01 (or 1%) to
miss a certain case on each of several test stages. Fig 3(C) shows that the (compounded)
expected rate of identified cases (true positives) therefore drops by between 1% and 5%
in total. Hence, the sensitivity of a hierarchical approach is lower compared to individual
testing. In contrast, the likelihood of incorrectly classifying a subject as infected is reduced

parameters as of April 14, 2020, see Table 1

from 1% to almost 0%, see Fig 3(D); i.e. when carrying out a hierarchical approach the
specificity is improved compared to individual testing.
To illustrate why the number of identified cases per test (ICPT) is a suitable measure
to compare the effectiveness of different pooling methods, we simulate the application of
100,000 tests on a population of 1 million individuals, see Table 3. We demonstrate that
while the number of false negatives increases when employing pooling methods, two other
measures change to a much greater degree: the number of untested (infected) individuals
decreases and the number of true positives increases. As before, we assume an infection
rate of 1%. The effectiveness of each approach can directly be observed via the number
of individuals tested in a given population. While for individual testing the number of
tested individuals equals the number of tests available, 2-level pooling examines 490,792
individuals on average with 100,000 tests, and Sobel-R1 can test the whole population
more than once (1.08 times). Binary splitting is best suited to illustrate the occurrence of
false negatives: the overall sensitivity is reduced from 99% to about 94.2% (see Fig. 3(C)),
and the false negative rate increases correspondingly from 1% to 6.8%. In our simulation,
the expected number of cases that are not correctly classified as infected increases from 10
to 471. However, binary splitting at the same time correctly identifies 8,363 more infected
individuals which individual testing was not able to test. Our results clearly show that all

11

pooling methods significantly outperform individual testing, with the additional benefit
of fewer people being sent to quarantine despite being healthy (fp).

of 1 million; full statistics over 10 simulations each. Simulating
100,000 tests on a total population of 1 million with an infection rate of 1%.
We assume a sensitivity of 99% and a false negative rate of 1% for a single
PCR, and no dilution due to pooling. We report how many individuals
are tested with 100,000 (pooled) tests as well as true positives (tp), false
positives (fp), false negatives (fn) and true negatives (tn). The reported
numbers are averaged over 10 runs testing the whole population, measuring
a relative standard deviation of < 0.3% each. (*) Note that Sobel-R1 is able
to test the whole population 1.08 times; this methods identifies 10, 442.2 >
10, 000 cases, identifying 832 cases in the second run leading to a negative
value in the last entry.

Note that with binary splitting a single sample can undergo up to six sequential testing
steps. Purim and 2-level testing can be carried out in two sequential testing steps. For
recursive binary splitting and Sobel-R1, re-pooling the batch sizes can lead to large numbers of sequential stages (up to 17 and 23 hierarchical steps in the worst case scenario for
multiple cases in a pool, respectively). For Sobel-R1 as the (theoretical) optimal method,
at an infection rate of 1%, only 5% of tests could be carried out with at most 5 hierarchical
steps, whereas 95% could be carried out with at most 13 hierarchical steps.

5. Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first comprehensive, comparative
assessment of optimised testing strategies for effective large-scale screening for infection
with SARS-CoV-2. Our simulations indicate that population-level diagnostics in a pandemic the scale of COVID-19 will only be possible by making use of pool-based strategies
– at the time of our study in May 2020, testing even 10% of the US population with the
available testing capacity would have take more than seven months.
Our study enables the following key conclusions for mass testing for COVID-19:
(1) Screening the entire population can be carried out several times faster via hierarchical or matrix-based approaches compared with individual testing in every
considered scenario.
(2) Among the methods that can be considered immediately applicable in practice,
we see that with respect to an optimal ICPT:
(a) Binary splitting is the best method for infection rates between 0% and 2.5%.
(b) Purim is the best method for infection rates between 2.5% and 12%.
(c) 2-level pooling is the best method for infection rates beyond 12%.
(3) Recursive binary splitting and the Sobel-R1 method would allow to significantly
improve the ICPT. However, to be practically applicable, first, either the time
required to process each individual test would have to be reduced or the possible
storage time of samples would have to be increased by a factor of about two (given
the average number of hierarchical steps expected). Second, sufficient sample material would have to be available for a large number of repeat tests. Third, software
support for lab technicians would need to be provided to guide lab operations and
ensure that the method can be carried out swiftly and correctly.
With a maximum pool size of 32, binary splitting requires up to six sequential testing
steps for a single sample. With an assumed duration of 5 hours per test, individual results
are available after 30h and six subdivisions of the sample for a pool size of 32, which we
consider as a realistic scenario. Purim and 2-level testing can be carried out in two
sequential testing steps. These methods conclude testing after 10h and can realistically
be applied in practice as of now.
Of note, all hierarchical models require adequate scheduling of the processes within the
involved laboratories, as the performance of certain tests is conditional upon the outcome
of previous tests. However, these scheduling problems are well studied, with standard-type
optimisations available that can easily be implemented.
For the purpose of this study, algorithms were implemented as described in the literature. Therefore, certain adaptations to account for medical and legal requirements
might be needed (e.g. Sobel-R1 can identify cases via exclusion, requiring an additional
confirmation step to be included for full clinical applicability).
In recent publications and preprints published in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic,
2-level pooling with optimised pool size, matrix-based approaches for pooled screening and
binary splitting were presented. 17,22,24–28 Our simulations include models of all of these
central categories of approaches, benchmarking and comparing the various testing strategies, and demonstrating for which scenarios each method can become the optimal choice.

13

Our model calculations prioritise identifying infected individuals as soon as possible to
prevent further spread, i.e. optimising for speed of completion of a screening campaign.
This is especially important since regular re-testing will be necessary given the continuous
risk of infection and potentially even recurrence as highlighted by recent case reports.
Of course, differences in test characteristics – sensitivity, rate of false positives, and
processing time – have a significant impact on the choice of testing strategy. In particular,
test sensitivities were recently reported to be in the range of 0.75 for sputum or nasal
swabs. 29 However, based on the same study, the decreased sensitivity can mostly be
attributed to the quality of the samples and variations in distribution of viral load in
patients – in other words, the samples taken will or will not contain viral material that
could be amplified during the PCR tests (with their sensitivity remaining constant at
0.99). Thus, if a sample contains no viral material, then any method will fail, whether
individual or pooled. If a sample, however, contains viral material, pooling – which
happens after sample taking – can be conducted and is advisable as discussed in this
paper. For illustration, a 0.75 test sensitivity scenario is given in the supplementaries
in S1 and S2, showing that even under these assumptions, pooling is still advisable.
In addition, all variations can be modelled via our online tool
https://covid19.enfunction.com.
We show that a hierarchical testing approach increases the specificity of a screening
campaign. The reduced number of false positives is important, as it equates to ca. 1,000
healthy individuals who would otherwise have been erroneously quarantined in a population of 100,000. At the same time, binary and recursive binary splitting correctly identify
up to ten times more cases per test compared to the currently employed individual testing.
Furthermore, they enable multiple screening campaigns within the same time normally
required for a single screening campaign where each sample is tested individually.
One of the biggest caveats of any modelling approach is the need to show that theoretical
simulations can be successfully translated into public health measures. Hogan et al. and
Yelin et al. recently presented their findings on the practical applicability of sample pooling
in California and Israel, respectively, thereby providing important experimental validation
for our modelling approach. 13,15 In fact, Yelin et al. even showed that a pool size of up to 64
still provides an acceptable sensitivity, potentially enabling larger pool sizes that would
increase the benefits of hierarchical pooling approaches. The exact maximum number
of samples that can be pooled and analysed while maintaining adequate sensitivity will
likely depend on the characteristics of each test and is an important question for followon work. Of note, on 13 April 2020, the Indian Council of Medical Research published
guidance recommending limited 2-level pooling to increase screening capacity – to our
best knowledge the first pooling approach formally adopted as of now, but certainly not
the last. 30
6. Conclusion
Rapid identification of patients, asymptomatic carriers, and the modes of transmission
of a given pathogen are key goals of pandemic response, that can then be embedded into a
larger set of medical countermeasures. 31 This study provides a theoretical framework and

practical guidance to frontline medical staff, public health authorities, and governments
on how to best deploy limited testing resources to maximise the number of people tested in
the shortest amount of time possible – in the case of COVID-19 as well as future pandemic
outbreaks.
