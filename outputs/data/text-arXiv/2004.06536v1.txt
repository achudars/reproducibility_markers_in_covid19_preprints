Abstract
Within the context that Greece promises a success story in the fight against the disease, this paper
proposes a novel method to study the evolution of the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve in relation
to the anti-COVID-19 policies applied to control the pandemic. Based on the ongoing spreading of
COVID-19 and the insufficient data for applying classic time-series approaches, the analysis builds
on the visibility graph algorithm to study the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve as a complex
network. By using the modularity optimization algorithm, the generated visibility graph is divided
into communities defining periods of different connectivity in the time-series body. These periods
reveal a sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease, starting with a power
pattern, where a second order polynomial (U-shaped) pattern intermediates, being followed by a
couple of exponential patterns, and ending up with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that the
evolution of the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve tends into saturation. The network analysis also
illustrates stability of hubs and instability of medium and low-degree nodes, implying a low
probability to meet maximum (infection) values at the future and high uncertainty in the variability
of other values below the average. The overall approach contributes to the scientific research by
proposing a novel method for the structural decomposition of a time-series into periods, which
allows removing from the series the disconnected past-data facilitating better forecasting, and
provides insights of good policy and decision-making practices and management that may help
other countries improve their performance in the war against COVID-19.

1. INTRODUCTION
Starting at December 2019, in Wuhan city (China), the COVID-19 coronavirus disease is a
new epidemic being virally spread across the world, causing cascading deaths and
uncertainty for the future of the global and national economies (Anderson et al., 2020;
McKibbin et al., 2020; WHO, 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Prime epidemiological studies on the
COVID-19 infection and death curves (Li et al., 2020a,b; Liu et al., 2020) reveal the
existence of strong scaling dynamics in the spreading of the disease, which appears to
initiate under an exponential growth. While the major concern of the research community
and academia is obviously to find a cure for defeating this lethal pandemic (Gao et al.,
2020; Gautret et al., 2020), it is a consensus that (even when a laboratory formula will be
soon available) the process of moving a cure from the laboratory to the production phase
p. | 1

cannot be done at once. Therefore, beyond the global expectations that the day of a cure to
this pandemic is forthcoming, governments worldwide are currently facing the challenge of
managing their medical and human resources against the scaling (exponential-alike) trends
of the disease-spreading (Anderson et al., 2020; McKibbin et al., 2020; Remuzzi and
Remuzzi, 2020). The case of Italy was among the first countries dealing with COVID-19
outside the country of its origin, China. The uncontrolled spreading of the disease and the
number of casualties (Roser and Ritchie, 2020) in Italy imply, on the one hand, the inertia
of social life and structures to abrupt changes (Liningston and Bucher, 2020) and, on the
other hand, the small-world (Watts and Strogatz, 1998; Christakis and Fowler, 2009;
Tsiotas, 2019) configuration of modern societies developing network structures. Although
current scientific knowledge have led to the development of standardized protocols, best
practices, and policies for controlling the pandemic (Bedford et al., 2020; Sohrabi, 2020),
countries worldwide show diverse patterns of conformance to these instructions,
determining thus the evolution of the disease in their population in different ways. For
instance, USA, UK, and Sweden, which appear to build up (at least initially) to the “herd
immunity” strategy (Cohen, 2020) are currently included in the top-ten countries in
COVID-19 mortality rates (Roser and Ritchie, 2020), whereas others showing early
emergence seem to succeed suspending their casualties.
Greece is an insightful case of good performance for its anti-COVID-19 policies,
which currently manages to keep the infected cases and deaths at relatively low levels
(Roser and Ritchie, 2020; Xu et al., 2020). In particular, Greece faced the first case of
infection on February 26th, 2020, and just three days later it started applying several
policies for controlling the disease. This timely alert and response have led Greece to be
currently in the last places of the European Countries, in terms of infection and mortality
rates of COVID-19 (Roser and Ritchie, 2020; Xu et al., 2020), setting the conditions to
consider its case as a success story in the war against the pandemic. Within the context of
promising a success story, this paper studies the evolution of the COVID-19 infectioncurve in Greece in relation to the anti-COVID-19 policies applied by the state to control
the disease aiming to detect whether and how these policies affected the dynamics of the
disease spreading. Provided that the spreading of COVID-19 in Greece counts a less than
two months period, the classic time-series analysis approaches are inevitably subjected to
high level of uncertainty for forecasting the future of the epidemic (Box et al., 2015).
Besides, prime quantitative approaches have already sufficed to reveal the exponential
dynamics in the spreading of the disease (Li et al., 2020a,b; Liu et al., 2020). Therefore,
this paper advances current quantitative approaches by building on complex network
analysis of time-series to transform the COVID-19 infection-curve to a complex network.
To do so, the visibility graph algorithm is applied (Lacasa et al., 2008), which is a nonparametric approach able to provide structural insights of the time-series and to transform
it to a complex network that is a tensor of higher dimension in comparison to the series
(Box et al., 2015; Tsiotas and Charakopoulos, 2020). The associated to the time-series
visibility graph is detected for communities, based on the modularity optimization
algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008), aiming to develop a partition of the time-series and
therefore to interpret their significance in accordance with the anti-COVID-19 policies
applied by the Greek state.
The overall approach, first, aims to provide insights of good policy and decision
making practices and management that may help other countries improve their
performance against the pandemic. Secondly, it contributes to the scientific research by
proposing a novel method for the structural decomposition of a time-series into periods
that allow removing from the series the disconnected past data and thus it facilitates better

p. | 2

forecasting. Both the proposed methodological framework and the cases of the current
success story of Greece can be proven effective in the war against COVID-19.
2. METHODOLOGY AND DATA
The methodological framework builds on complex network-based analysis of time-series
to transform the time-series of the COVID-19 infection-curve in Greece to a complex
network and then to examine the associated complex network instead of the time-series.
The methodology consists of three steps; at the first, an associated visibility graph is
generated from the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve where its degree distribution is
examined. At the second step, the associated visibility graph is divided into communities
according to the modularity optimization algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008) and then the
time-series corresponding to each community are examined by using curve fitting
techniques. At the final step, the Greek anti-COVID-19 policies included in each
community are discussed and a policy profile for each community is attempted to develop.
The dataset considered in the analysis includes the starting day (February 26th, 2020)
where the first infection emerged in Greece, up to the 43rd day (April 4th, 2020). Each day
following the last day included in the time-series (up to the publication of the preprint of
this paper) is used to verify forecasting ability of each community.
2.1. Generating a visibility graph
Lacasa et al. (2008) proposed an algorithm, the natural visibility algorithm (NVG), for
transforming a time-series into a graph (complex network) GV(V,E). The NVG builds on
the intuition that each node of a time series can be seen as a mountain with an observer
standing on it, where other nodes are visible to each observer according to their heights
(values). In technical terms, each node (tk, x(tk)) of the time-series corresponds to a graph
node n  V (preserving the time-series order) and two nodes ni, nj  V are connected (ni,nj) 
E when a visibility line between the corresponding time-series data can be drawn (i.e. if it
is possible to draw a straight line between values without interception with other values),
as it is shown in Fig.1. Within the “landscape” configured by the time-series, a node (bar)
is visible by a node (no) when no other node intersects the visibility lines originating from
no.

Fig.1. Example of the natural visibility algorithm (NVG), which generates a network (right

side) from a time-series (left side). Dashed lines in the time-series‟ plot represent the
visibility lines.
The mathematical expression of the NVG connectivity criterion is given by
inequality:
x(tk )  x(ti )  ( x(t j )  x(ti ))

tk  ti
t j  ti

(1),

p. | 3

where x(ti) and x(tj) express the numeric values of the time-series nodes and ti, tj their timereference points. In a network mapped according to the visibility algorithm, each node is
visible at least by its nearest (left and right) neighbors (Gao et al., 2017; Tsiotas and
Charakopoulos, 2020).
2.2. Community detection based on modularity optimization
The associated to the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve visibility graph GV(V,E), which is
generated by the NVG algorithm, is divided to communities by using the modularity
optimization algorithm of Blondel et al. (2008). This algorithm produces a number of
communities under the criterion to maximize the intra-community (i.e. within the
communities) connectivity and therefore to minimize the inter-community (between the
communities) connectivity, as denoted by the expression:
maximize [Q  ( mwithin communities – mbetween communities )]

(2),

where Q is the modularity function (Fortunato, 2010) and m the number of links. The
modularity optimization algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008) is a greedy approach applied in
two steps. At the first step, all graph nodes are assigned into different communities. Next,
the nodes are sequentially being swept and placed to collective communities if the
assignment of a node into a neighbor community increases the gain in the weighted
modularity function (Qw) of the initial graph. At the second step, the collective
communities are replaced by super-nodes and the procedure is repeated until the
modularity function cannot increase any more (Fortunato, 2010; Tsiotas, 2019).
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Network analysis
The degree distribution p(k) of the associated to the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve
visibility graph (GV) is shown at Fig.2a. Among a set of available fittings (exponential,
Fourier, Gaussian, linear, up to 4th order polynomial, power, and logarithmic) that were
tested (Chapra, 2012) to the data, the normal (Gaussian) curve was found to have both the
highest coefficient of determination (R2=0.761) and the simplest expression (least number
of estimated terms). Comparatively to a power-law curve, which is a fitting of special
importance in network science for the detection of the scale-free property (Tsiotas, 2019)
and thus of hierarchical structures, the normal (Gaussian) curve with an estimated average


̂ = k =4.491 (number of connections per node) and an standard deviation ˆ =2.518
better fits to the p(k) data. The normal-shaped pattern of the degree distribution may have a
double interpretation. On the one hand, it implies that the network is ruled by randomness,
provided that a normal curve asymptotically approximates the binomial distribution, which
theoretically describes the degree distribution of random network (Barabasi, 2016). On the
other hand, it expresses that the network is subjected to spatial constraints (Barthelemy,
2016) and therefore that the associated visibility graph has more a mesh-alike rather than a
hierarchical structure. To get more insights about the topology of the GV, we examine the
sparsity (spy) plot of this visibility graph (Fig.2b), which is a plot of the adjacency matrix
displaying nonzero elements with dots (Tsiotas, 2019). The major concentration of the
nonzero elements towards the main diagonal of the matrix implies the existence of spatial
constraints (Tsiotas, 2019) in the visibility network, which verifies the previous
observation based on the degree distribution consideration. However, the vertical spreading
of dots in the spy plot may also indicate random trends (Tsiotas, 2019), which is also in
line with the previous observations.

According to the degree distribution and sparsity pattern consideration, the Greek
COVID-19 visibility graph is configured by random forces and spatial constraints. The
emergence of randomness illustrates that future connections (which are created based on
the daily infection values) may randomly attach to the network and therefore the future
maximum values of daily infection are possible. On the other hand, indications of spatial
constraints imply that future connections of the network are more depended on their
neighborhood values (i.e. the previous states) and thus the phenomenon of the disease can
resemble to a Markovian chain. However, regardless the insignificant level of power-law
determination (R2=0.174), a long-tail behavior of the degree distribution can be observed
for degree values higher than 10 (k > 10), which expresses that the network structure of the
GV is steadier for the hubs (i.e. nodes of high degree) than this of medium and low-degree
nodes. This observation implies that the probability to meet maximum (infection) values
(and therefore new hubs in the visibility network) at the future is considerably low, in
contrast to the medium and low-degree nodes, where their future behavior is more
uncertain.
3.2. Community detection
▪ Structural analysis
At the second step, the associated to the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve visibility graph
(GV) is divided into communities, on which connectivity within each community is dense
and between communities is sparse. The community discrimination of GV is shown in
Fig.3, where labels of network nodes express the day since the first infected case.
The community detection analysis of GV resulted to five discrete communities
(Fig.3b:g), which appear into a sequential ordering (Q1, Q2, Q1, Q3, Q4, Q5), except the
second community (Q2) that is injected (intermediated) to the first one. This mixed
configuration of the first and second community (Q1, Q2, Q1,…) suggests a novel finding
due to modularity optimization approach, which cannot (or hardly can) be detected by
other established time-series approaches. As being evident in Fig.3, the evolution of the
Greek COVID-19 infection-curve is vertebral and consists of five discrete time-periods
(parts or communities). The first (Q1) starts from the 1rst day and ends up to the 19th day
(Fig.3c) of the infection spreading in Greece and is described by a scaling (power) pattern
(R12=0.98) with an exponent a1≈2.21. The second part (Q2) is injected in the first one and
is extended to the time-interval Q2=[5,8]={5,6,7,8}   (Fig.3d), described by a (2nd order)
polynomial (U-shaped) pattern (R22=0.933) with a positive coefficient (a2≈0.5) of the
highest order term. The third part (Q3) follows the first one, is extended to the time-period
p. | 5

Q3=[20,26]   (Fig.3e), and is described by an exponential pattern (R12=0.986) of
exponent a3≈0.09. Next, the fourth part (Q4) is extended to the time-interval Q4=[27,32] 
 (Fig.3f) and it is also described by an exponential pattern (R12=0.986), but of smaller
exponent than the previous period (a4≈0.085 < a3). Finally, the fifth part (Q5) is extended
to the time-interval Q4=[33,43]   (Fig.3f) and is described by a logarithmic pattern
(R12=0.983).

show best fittings (of the highest R2) within each community.

p. | 6

Overall, according to the sequence of the modularity communities in the time-series
body, the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve initiated the first three days (Q1) with scaling
(power) dynamics. Next, it showed an abrupt (U-shaped) tendency at the next four days
(Q2), which was returned to the previous scaling (power) status (Q1), where it remained for
the next 11 days [9,19]  . The next 13 days [20,32]  , the Greek COVID-19 infectioncurve showed an exponential growth but in the mid-time of the period the exponent was
decreased, and finally the last 11 days ([33,43]  ) the infection-curve showed a
logarithmic trend implying that the evolution of the infection-curve leads to saturation.
▪ Forecasting
Based on the fittings applied to each community (Q1:Q5), future infections of the COVID19 infection-curve for the next (to the 43rd day) 11 days are estimated and shown in Table
1. In this paper, the analysis is based on the Greek COVID-19 infection time-series,
starting from the 1st day and ending at the 43rd day since the first infection (namely on the
set [1,43]  ). Post to the 43rd day cases (emerging at the time writing this paper) are
registered in Table 1 to test the estimations (as verification set).

*. Due to the evolving status of the COVID-19 infection-curve, the overall analysis was applied up to the 43rd day since the first
infection. Additional cases appearing at the time preparing the paper are entered in the column named “observed infections” and
are used as verification set to the estimations shown in columns corresponding to the Q1:Q5 communities.

As it can be observed in Table 1, the logarithmic curve of the last modularity
community interval (Q5) provides the most accurate estimations of the three updated days
amongst the five available community intervals. Moreover, differences of most of
communities seem to be of a certain magnitude (~600 for Q1, ~1200 for Q2, ~ –1200 for
Q3, ~ –1100 for Q4, and ~ –30 for Q5), which may be related to the effectiveness of the
overall community detection approach.
3.3. Policy assessment
At the final step, the communities resulted from the modularity optimization algorithm are
examined in accordance with the anti-COVID-19 policies applied by the Greek state in the
meantime. Table A1 (shown in the appendix) summarizes the evolution of the major
policies of the state in the fight against the disease, which are grouped according to the
communities resulted by the analysis. As it can be observed, the first three days (  Q1) of
evolution of the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve, the state applied optional policy
measures for the control of the disease. The first compulsory measure was taken at the end
of the (intermediated) Q2 period, applied at local scale, showing perhaps an alerted of the
p. | 7

state for the changing dynamics of the disease. During the second half of the first (Q1)
period, which is placed between the 9th to 19th days since the first infection, a set of
compulsory measures was taken for the first time at the national scale, concerning
suspension of educational, cultural, justice, and recreation functions and activities. At the
next two periods (Q3 and Q4) of exponential growth, more severe measures were applied.
Measures of Q3 period concern national suspension of gathering, religious, and tourism
activities and of maritime transport. On the other hand, the defining measure of the Q4
period was started at its beginning and concerns the national restriction of road transport.
The defining measure of the final period (Q5) regards the control of transportation and
particularly the national suspension of private air transport. Overall, the time evolution of
the major Greek anti-COVID-19 policies in comparison to the structure of the modularity
optimization time-periods of the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve, signify a timely alert of
the Greek state to the cascading dynamics of the pandemic. The evolution in the change of
type of the fitting curve, from power to polynomial, to power, to exponential, to a
smoother exponential, and currently (at the time writing this paper) to logarithmic reveal
that anti-COVID-19 policies applied by the Greek state succeed currently to control the
cascading spread of the disease.
4. CONCLUSIONS
The Greek anti-COVID-19 policies were applied just three days after the emergence of the
first infected case in the country appear determinative to the evolution of the COVID-19
infection-curve. The study built on complex network analysis of time-series (based on the
visibility graph algorithm) to detect dynamics in the structure of the infection-curve that
are not visible by using classic time-series analysis methods, due to data limitation.
Network analysis applied to the time series showed the existence of spatial constraints
mixed with random trends, illustrating that (in the long-term) the evolution of the Greek
COVID-19 infection-curve resembles to a Markovian chain with slightly random
transitions. In terms of forecasting, the structural analysis of the visibility graph detected
stability of the hubs and instability of the medium and low-degree nodes, implying a low
probability to meet maximum (infection) values at the future and high uncertainty in the
variability of medium and lower values. Based on the modularity optimization algorithm,
the Greek COVID-19 associated visibility graph is divided to five stages (periods) of
different connectivity ruling the evolution of the pandemic in Greece. The first stage is
described by a power pattern, the second (which intermediates the first one) is described by
a second order polynomial (U-shaped) pattern, the third and fourth by exponential patterns,
and a final one by a logarithmic pattern implying that the Greek COVID-19 infectioncurve tends to saturate. The resulting of the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve to a
logarithmic pattern can illustrate the effectiveness of the anti-COVID-19 policies applied
in Greece, during the 43 days since the emergence of the first infected case. This
measurable evolution COVID-19 infection-curve allows currently considering Greece as a
success story in the war against the pandemic. However, a long way is still pending and in
conjunction with the global expectations that the day of a cure to this pandemic is
forthcoming, this paper provides insights for the current success story of Greece to inspire
other countries towards more effective anti-COVID-19 policies and management.
