In 2020, countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic implemented various non-pharmaceutical

1

interventions to contrast the spread of the virus and its impact on their healthcare systems
and economies. Using Italian data at different geographic scales, we investigate the relationship between human mobility, which subsumes many facets of the population’s response to
the changing situation, and the spread of COVID-19. Leveraging mobile phone data from
February through September 2020, we find a striking relationship between the decrease in
mobility flows and the net reproduction number. We find that the time needed to switch off
mobility and bring the net reproduction number below the critical threshold of 1 is about one
week. Moreover, we observe a strong relationship between the number of days spent above
such threshold before the lockdown-induced drop in mobility flows and the total number of
infections per 100k inhabitants. Estimating the statistical effect of mobility flows on the net
reproduction number over time, we document a 2-week lag positive association, strong in
March and April, and weaker but still significant in June.
Our study demonstrates the value of big mobility data to monitor the epidemic and inform
control interventions during its unfolding.

Introduction

During the COVID-19 pandemic, countries put in place a wide variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions 1–3 , such as closures of activities and travel restrictions, aimed at containing the spread
of the virus, mitigating the impact on the healthcare system, and saving lives. Accordingly, citizens
adjusted their behavior to the restrictions and the recommendations for personal protection, such
as wearing face masks and maintaining social distance. Understanding and monitoring the pan-

2

demic’s evolution in a continuously changing context of policy interventions and behavioral shifts
is challenging and yet crucial for policymakers – who need to evaluate the effects of the implemented measures and plan future restrictions or relaxations as the situation unfolds. While different
social, economic, demographic, cultural, and psychological variables are at play in the complex
and quickly evolving scenario of a pandemic, one physical quantity subsumes many facets of the
population’s response: mobility, i.e. the number of trips, at any scale, that people take to perform
their daily activities. Human mobility is a powerful, objective proxy for people’s behavior and
its adaptation in response to different stimuli during a pandemic, and we have a reliable tool for
observing and quantifying human mobility with precision at country scale: mobile phone data 4–8 .

More than a decade of experience in acquisition and analysis of geolocated, spatio-temporal
traces left behind by smartphone users has already shown how models based on such data can account for different aspects of our society, also beyond mere mobility 7, 9–16 . Mobile phone records
provide an unprecedented opportunity to track human displacements 4–7 , allowing one to estimate

In this paper, we investigate in depth the relationship between human mobility and the spread
of COVID-19 at different geographic scales, leveraging nation-wide Italian mobile phone data
provided by two major telecom operators, Vodafone and WindTre, spanning 9 months since the
start the outbreak of the virus.a We compare the evolution of daily mobility flows and the evolution
of viral transmissibility, measured by the net reproduction number (mean number of secondary
infections generated by one primary infector) from January through September 2020 – a period
in which several control interventions and human behavioral adaptations took place across the
country. As a key result, we find a striking relationship between the decrease in mobility flows and
the decrease in net reproduction number in all Italian regions between March 11th and March 16th,
when the country entered the national lockdown. We can quantify the time needed to switch off
mobility and the time required to bring the net reproduction number below the critical threshold of
1 (one week).

We also find a strong relationship between the number of days spent above the epidemic
threshold before the lockdown-induced drop in mobility flows and the total number of confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100k inhabitants. While many other factors may have played a role
in containing the contagion, including other non-pharmaceutical interventions, this observation
provides strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of mobility restrictions. Finally, we use

March and April and weaker but still significant in June.

Understanding the relationship between human mobility patterns and the spread of COVID19 is crucial, in particular, for restarting social and economic activities, which were limited or put
in stand-by during national and regional lockdowns, as well as to monitor the risk of a resurgence
during lockdown exits. Our study, developed within the context of the Italian data-driven task
force to support policy making during the COVID-19 epidemics, demonstrates the value of "big"
mobility data for monitoring the epidemic and inform control interventions during its unfolding.

Data sets

Mobility data. We use data derived from the records the two largest mobile phone operators in
Italy: WindTre and Vodafone, which cover together approximately two thirds of the Italian mobile
phone users.The basic geographical unit is the phone cell, defined as the area covered by a single
antenna, i.e., the device that captures mobile radio signals and keeps the user connected with
the phone network. Multiple antennas are usually mounted on the same tower, each covering a
different direction. The tower’s geographic position and the antenna’s direction allow one to infer
the extension of the corresponding phone cell. A user’s position is approximated by the antenna
serving the connection, whose extension is relatively small in urban contexts (in the order of 100m
× 100m) and larger in rural areas (in the order of 1km × 1km or more). A user’s mobility is
reconstructed as the sequence of towers their phone is connected to in time. A connection (event)
is created every time the user calls or makes an upload/download operation from the Internet. We
gather such data for the period from February 01st, 2020, to September 30th, 2020.

We reconstruct daily Origin-Destination matrices (ODs)

22, 56, 57

in which the flow between

two municipalities i and j is the number of individuals that moved from i to j in a given day.
To reduce noise, we consider only movements for which the individual remains in the destination
municipality for at least 30 minutes. For privacy-preserving purposes, we remove from the OD matrices flows with less than 15 trips between two municipalities. To match the available COVID-19
data, we aggregate the municipality-to-municipality ODs into province-to-province and regionto-region ODs, in which each node represents an Italian province or region. In particular, for
each day, we compute both the in-flows, which capture the total number of people moving to a
province/region from any other province/region, and the self-flows, which capture trips between
municipalities of the same province/region. We then sum in-flows and self-flows to form a daily
time series Mt for each province/region. Figure 1 shows the structure of the region-to-region OD
matrices for different days in the period of observation. As expected, we found no statistically
significant differences between the OD matrices from the two mobile phone operators, to the purpose of the analyses presented in this paper. This observation brings robustness to the results, and
allows use to use any of the two sources.

Epidemiological data. For each Italian province/region, we consider the daily time series Rt of
the net reproduction number, which represents the mean number of secondary infections generated
by one primary infector. When Rt decreases below the epidemic threshold of 1, the number of
new infections begins to decline. Rt was estimated from the daily time series of new cases by
date of symptom onset. Case-based surveillance data used for estimating Rt were collected by
regional health authorities and collated by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) using a secure

and heterogeneity in destinations decreased during lockdown or phase 2 (e.g., March 11, May 11), with a tendency

based on the knowledge of the distribution of the

generation time and on the time series of cases. In particular, the posterior distribution of Rt for any

where P (x; λ) is the probability mass function of a Poisson distribution (i.e., the probability of

symptoms onset at time t; Rt is the net reproduction number at time t (the quantity to be estimated);
and φ(s) is the probability distribution density of the generation time evaluated at time s.

As a proxy for the distribution of the generation time, we used the distribution of the serial
interval, estimated from the analysis of contact tracing data in Lombardy 58 , i.e., a gamma function
with shape 1.87 and rate 0.28, having a mean of 6.6 days. This estimate is within the range
of other available estimates for SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e., between 4 and 7.5 days

62–64

. The

number of reported SARS-COV-2 infections is provided by Protezione Civile, the Italian public
institution in charge of monitoring the COVID-19 emergency. They collect data from every Italian
administrative region and make them available on a public repository. For each province/region,
we focus on the number of new positive cases per day. Specifically, given a day g, we average
the values over the four days before and the four days after g. Figure 1 shows the value of Rt for
8

Italian regions in different days of the observation period.

Relationship between Mt and Rt

Figure 2 shows Mt (blue curves), Rt (orange curves) and the number of positive cases (grey curves)
for three Italian regions (similar plots for all other regions are provided in Supplementary Figure
S1). In all regions, Mt decreases sharply soon after the first national lockdown (March 11th) and
stabilizes on a new, reduced level after about one week. Subsequent restriction ordinances, such
as the closing of non-essential economic activities on March 17th , have a minor impact on the
reduction of Mt . In almost all regions, Mt increases at the start of “phase 2" (partial lifting of the
lockdown) on May 4th. This behaviour is particularly pronounced for Emilia-Romagna (Figure
2c), Toscana, Puglia and Lazio (Supplementary Figure S1 j,m,q). Interestingly, we find a slight
increase of Mt approaching May 4th. This may be due to a progressive, although slight, relaxation
of compliance with the mobility limitations imposed by the lockdown. The case of Molise is
different and particularly compelling: it is indeed the only region for which Mt decreases after
May 4th (Supplementary Figure S1 o). This may be due to news media coverage of a funeral on
April 30th, attended by a large number of people, which resulted in a large local outbreak. The
news may have induced parts of the population of Molise to self-restrict movements during the
following days. Mt returns to the original level between May and June, around two weeks after
the starting of phase 2.

Although the date when Rt surpasses 1 for the first time varies from region to region, for most

between Feb - Sep 2020 for Piemonte (a), Lombardia (b), Emilia-Romagna (c). Orange-shaded areas mark periods where Rt > 1. Vertical dashed
lines indicate: beginning of national lockdown (LD, March 9th, 2020), closing of non-essential economic activities (CNA, March 23th, 2020), partial
restart of economic activities and within-region mobility (“Ph 2”, May 4th, 2020), and beginning of the school year (SCH). In panel (d), regions
are represented in terms of the number of days between the first occurrence of Rt > 1 and the beginning of the national lockdown (horizontal
axis), and the cumulative incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100k inhabitants as of May 15th, 2020 (vertical axis). The size of the
circles is proportional to the total number of positive cases in the period. A linear least square fit (dotted line) indicates a positive relationship. Panel
(e) schematizes the epi-mob pattern: during the first week of lockdown, the two curves describing mobility flows and net reproduction number
gracefully overlap. At the end of this week, the country reaches a new mobility regime at ≈40% of the pre-lockdown level.

10

of the regions Rt decreases concurrently with Mt due to the beginning of the national lockdown
(see Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S2), highlighting the importance of governmental interventions to reduce mobility. Note that, for most of the regions, Rt reaches values lower than 1 starting
around March 16th, when Mt stabilizes on the new, reduced level until May (Supplementary Figure S1). Mt increases between May and June. Yet, in this period, Rt continues to decrease. This
may be due to human mobility not coming back to the usual volume and connectivity, as well as
to other ordinances by local and national governments related to the wearing of masks and gloves
in public areas, social distancing and ban on gatherings – and possibly to other factors to be further investigated. While Mt remains stable until mid August, in many regions Rt starts slightly
increasing again from June onward, though with different patterns in different regions. This result
indicates that releasing mobility restrictions for a long enough time boosts the circulation of the
virus, highlighting a fortiori the relationships between mobility and viral transmissibility.

We go one step further in our analysis of the relationship between mobility flows and contagion by computing two quantities for each region: (i) the delay in mobility reduction, i.e., the
number of days in which Rt > 1 before the regional Mt decreases by at least 20% w.r.t. the usual
(pre-epidemics) weekly mobility, observed over the first two weeks of February; and (ii) the total
number of reported SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100k inhabitants in the region (as of May 15th,
2020, when national mobility restrictions were released).

The date of mobility reduction below 20% for each region is indicated as the MR black
vertical line in Figures 2(a), (b) and (c). As shown in Figure 2(d), the two quantities are positively

11

and significantly correlated (Pearson coefficient= 0.46, p < 0.05, r2 = 0.21) – suggesting that
larger delays could have induced heavier spreading of the virus. This is strong evidence that timely
lockdowns are instrumental for better containment of the contagion.

The delay in mobility reduction in Lombardy was 32 days, leading to the highest number of
positive cases per inhabitant in Italy. Similarly, for other regions severely affected by the virus,
such as Liguria, Emilia-Romagna and Piemonte, the delays in mobility reduction were 32 and 38
days, respectively. The north-central and north-western regions all lie above the dashed regression
line in the top right portion of the scatter plot in Figure 2(d). Regions below this line in the bottom
right portion of the plot, such as Veneto, Lazio and Tuscany, were more effective in containing the
contagion, despite delays in mobility reduction of 30 days or more. This fact may be explained by
several factors, including the effectiveness of the epidemic surveillance, the intensity of the testing
and tracing strategy adopted, the capacity of outbreak containment, and also the absolute number
of cases when Rt jumps above 1. On the other hand, southern regions all had smaller delays
in mobility reduction – in the range of 10 (Molise, Basilicata) to 20 (Campania, Puglia, Sicily,
Calabria) days. This appears to have helped in containing the spread of the virus; all southern
regions (with the only exception of Molise) are below the regression line in the bottom left portion
of the plot, with low numbers of infections per 100K inhabitants. In summary, the regions that
appear to have benefited the most from the lockdown are those where the reduction in mobility
occurred in a more timely fashion.

Lags and Function-on-function regression

Another way to characterize the relationship between Mt and Rt is to employ statistical tools from
Functional Data Analysis (FDA). These allow us to efficiently exploit the longitudinal information
at our disposal, evaluating lags and regressing transmissibility onto mobility. First, we smooth the
discrete observations of Rt and Mt using B-splines basis functions of order 4 65 . To remove daily
fluctuations and weekly trends, we use 32 basis functions – one per week – and add a roughness
penalty on the second derivative of the curves. We select the smoothing parameter minimizing the
average generalized cross-validation error across all the curves

66

. Panels (a) and (b) in Supple-

mentary Figure S2 show smoothed Rt and Mt curves for the twenty Italian regions, respectively.
Based on the averages of these two sets of curves (black solid lines), the delay between the Mt peak
(late February) and the Rt peak (early March) is approximately 2 weeks – 13 days. A similar lag is
supported considering the projections of the curves on their first functional covariance component
(FCC) 67 . The first FCC identifies a reduced functional space which captures the most important
mode of covariation between Rt and Mt , and allows us to further de-noise the data. Panels (c)
and (d) in Supplementary Figure S2 show the FCC projections together with their averages (again
black solid lines). The peaks are again 13 days apart.

Next, we seek an optimal alignment (or registration) of the curves which, separating horizontal and vertical variation, increases the statistical power of the analysis 65 . Specifically, for each
region, we estimate the horizontal shift (capped at a maximum of 20 days) that minimizes the L2
R
distance (R(t) − R̃(t))2 dt between the Rt curve and its FCC projection R̃(t) (FCC projections

13

are an ideal alignment target here since they do not exhibit any horizontal variation; see Figure S2).
We apply the estimated shifts to the Rt as well as the Mt curve in each region, preserving their
time consistency. The shifted Rt and Mt curves restricted to the intersection of their new time
domains are displayed in Figure 3 panels (a) and (b), respectively. The estimated shifts are shown
in Supplementary Figure S2 panel (e). One can note how the registration procedure translates the
epidemic curves aligning the Rt peaks.

Finally, we apply function-on-function regression 68 to the registered curves to estimate the
statistical effect of Mt on Rt . In symbols, we fit the model:
Z
y(t) = α(t) + βmob (s, t)Mt (s)ds + (t)
where y(t) is the shifted Rt curve, α(t) is the intercept, (t) is the model error, and Mt (s) is the
shifted Mt . Mobility flows are integrated over time and the effect coefficient βmob (s, t) is a surface
that describes the association between Mt at time s and Rt at time t. Given the previously estimated
13 days lag between the two sets of curves, the portion of surface we are most interested in is the
curve identified by βmob (s, s+13), which represents the effect of mobility at time s on transmission
at time s + 13. Panels (c) and (d) in Figure 3 show the estimated surface β̂mob (s, t) and the curve
β̂mob (s, s + 13) with a 95% confidence band 69 , respectively. This suggests a strong positive effect
of mobility on transmissibility in March and April, and a second period of significant positive
association in June (in these intervals of the domain the confidence bands are clearly above 0). The
effect seems to be non-significant (confidence bands comprising 0) at the end of the time domain
– which, because of the alignment process and the 13 days lag is ante-dated to the beginning of
September.
14

The share of the variability in transmission explained by mobility on our data is high, approximately R2 = 0.73.

To further validate our results we performed an additional analysis adding a scalar predictor
(pc1) to the regression model 70 . This is a composite control, obtained as the first principal component of a set of covariates that may affect the epidemic in addition to mobility – see Supplementary
Figure S3 for a complete list. Introducing this control variable does not change our inference on
the effect of mobility flows (see Supplementary Figure S3). The total R2 of the joint model is again
0.73, while the the partial R2 of mobility and pc1 are 0.24 and 0.01, respectively – this indicates
how the effect of mobility is considerably stronger than the one of the control variable. A a second
form of validation, we repeated our analysis using the 120 Italian provinces.

This finer spatial resolution increases our sample size, and at the same time produces more
idiosyncratic curves. Rt is highly variable across provinces along the entire time domain considered. Mt is highly variable across provinces too, but especially during the summer, reflecting
differences between tourist destinations and other areas, with increased and depressed mobility
flows, respectively. Notwithstanding these differences, function-on-function regression produces
results consistent with those at the level of regions. β̂mob (s, s + 13) displays a strong positive effect
in March and April and a much weaker effect during the summer, with R2 = 0.53.

and Mt smoothed registered curves restricted to the intersection of their new time domains. Thick black lines are the
functional averages of the sets of curves. After the alignment the time domain is expressed in days, since the horizontal
translation changes the calendar dates for each region. Day 1 corresponds to March 9th. Panels in the bottom row
show the estimated effect surface β̂(s, t) and the curve β̂(s, s + 13) obtained along it (black “cut” along the surface)
with a 95% confidence band. The grey shaded areas represents the parts of the domain where the confidence bands
contain 0. β̂(s, s + 13) suggests a strong positive effect of mobility on transmission in March and April, and a second
period of significant positive association in June. The share of the variability in transmission explained by mobility on
our data is R2 = 0.73.

Conclusions

Our combined analysis of mobility and epidemic data highlighted a striking relation between decreases in mobility flows and net reproduction number, in all Italian regions, in a time interval of
approximately one week (from March 11th till March 16th) when the country transitioned between
pre- and post-lockdown mobility regimes. During this week, the two curves gracefully overlap –
until mobility stabilizes at about 40% of its pre-lockdown level. The two curves exhibit the same
pattern in most of the regions and provinces (see Supplementary Figure S1), with minimal temporal lags. We call this phenomenon, represented schematically in Figure 2e, the “epi-mob” pattern.
Mobility (the blue curve) depicts a switch between the two regimes, with an exponential fall from
pre- to post-lockdown levels. The net reproduction number (the orange curve) displays a peak,
with an exponential growth and fall, and overlaps with the switch during the latter.

Effectiveness of the lockdown for the containment of the epidemics is further substantiated
by the positive association we found between delays in mobility reduction and total number of
infected individuals per 100K inhabitants up to mid-May 2020. We can also quantify the time
needed to “switch off” mobility in the country and the time needed to bring the net reproduction
number below 1 (approximately 1 week).

Notice that Rt continues to slowly decrease during lockdown, and also that at the beginning
of Phase 2 (lockdown exit), when mobility begins to raise again, for most of the regions Rt does
not jump into a new uncontrolled growth for several months.

17

While we do not perform any analysis that may elucidate the role of other factors, this may
be due to other non-pharmaceutical interventions taking hold in the country, including increased
compliance with the use personal protective equipment and social distancing (compared to the
pre-lockdown phase).

We have also shown, through functional data analysis, that the typical delay between the Mt
peak and the Rt peak is around 2 weeks, both for regions and provinces. This allowed us to create
a regression model which shows a strong positive effect of mobility on transmission in March,
April, and June, both at regional and provincial level.

In conclusion, we believe that this study demonstrates the value of digital mobility data, a
detailed proxy of human behavior available every day in real time, for refining our understanding
of the dynamics of the epidemics, evaluating the effectiveness of policy choices, and monitoring
the unfolding of the epidemics in the coming months.

Figure 6: Results of the joint functional regression model. Transmission curves are regressed
against mobility curves and the scalar variable pc1. This is a composite control, obtained as the
first principal component of a set of covariates that may affect the epidemic in addition to mobility
– specifically: adults per family doctor, average beds per hospital, average students per classroom,
average employees per firm, and average members per household. The left and the center panels
shows the estimated effect surface β̂mob (s, t) for mobility and the curve β̂mob (s, s + 13) obtained
along it (black “cut” along the surface) with a 95% confidence band. The right panel shows the
estimated pc1 effect curve with a 95% confidence band. The gray shaded areas correspond to the
parts of the domain where the confidence bands include the 0. The time along the axis is expressed
in days. The starting date after the alignment process is postponed to March 9th. β̂mob (s, s + 13)
suggests a strong positive effect of mobility on transmission in March and April, and a second
period of significant positive association in June. β̂pc (t) has an effect very close to 0 along with
the all domain. The total R2 of the model is 0.73, while the partial R2 of mobility and pc1 are 0.26
and 0.01, respectively.
