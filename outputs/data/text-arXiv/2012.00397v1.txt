Abstract
The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still a worldwide
threat to human life since its invasion into the daily lives of the public in the first several
months of 2020. Predicting the size of confirmed cases is important for countries and communities to make proper prevention and control policies so as to effectively curb the spread
of COVID-19. Different from the 2003 SARS epidemic and the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, COVID-19 has unique epidemiological characteristics in its infectious and
recovered compartments. This drives us to formulate a new infectious dynamic model for
forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic within the human mobility network, named the SaucIRmodel in the sense that the new compartmental model extends the benchmark SIR model by
dividing the flow of people in the infected state into asymptomatic, pathologically infected
but unconfirmed, and confirmed. Furthermore, we employ dynamic modeling of population
flow in the model in order that spatial effects can be incorporated effectively. We forecast
the spread of accumulated confirmed cases in some provinces of mainland China and other
countries that experienced severe infection during the time period from late February to early
May 2020. The novelty of incorporating the geographic spread of the pandemic leads to a
surprisingly good agreement with published confirmed case reports. The numerical analysis
validates the high degree of predictability of our proposed SaucIR model compared to existing resemblance. The proposed forecasting SaucIR model is implemented in Python. A
web-based application is also developed by Dash (under construction).

Introduction

The conventional susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamic model is one of the simplest compartmental models in epidemiology that segments the flows of people into three states, i.e., susceptible (S), infected (I), and resistant/recovered (R). The SIR model is used to compute the
theoretical number of people infected with a contagious illness in a closed population over time
[Kermack(1927)]. It has been widely applied and expanded to estimate or to predict the spread
size of contagion phenomena such as the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 for the purpose of infection prevention and control
and public health strategies [Brockmann(2013)]. Modeling dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019,
COVID-19 in short, remains a big challenge, although there has been sporadic investigation in the
past few months [Hao(2020)]. The goal of this project is to to develop an expansion of the SIR
model, named SaucIR, in response to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic on the basis of its
specific epidemiological characteristics and dynamic migration.
Unfortunately, the officially deployed interventions based on the SIR model were invalidated at
the outbreak of COVID-19, particularly at the early stage when COVID-19 burst onto the global
pandemic scene, even though the SARS 2003 epidemic and COVID-19 share many similarities.
According to the editorial of New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in April 2020, the rapid,
worldwide spread of COVID-19 resulted in more than 2.6 million people infected within five months,
in contrast to the fact that SARS 2003 was controlled within 8 months with less than ten thousand
persons infected in limited geographic areas [Gandhi(2020)]. More worldwide dynamic data of
the infection spread are available to the public [Infection]. There are quite a few key factors
to interpret the dramatically different trajectories of transmission and spread between COVID19 and SARS 2003. For instance, one epidemiological key influence factor is the existence of
asymptomatic individuals, who are the silent carriers of coronavirus. Such asymptomatic infections
were diagnosed with positive RT-PCR test results but without any relevant clinical symptoms in
the preceding days or during hospitalization, inducing the risk of spreading the disease and hence
preventing ascertainment before symptoms [Gandhi(2020)]. Therefore, symptom-based detection
of infection is less effective in COVID-19, compared to influenza and the SARS 2003 epidemic
[To(2020)]. To examine asymptomatic transmission is necessary to fully consider in forecasting
the spread size of the COVID-19 pandemic for effective public health prevention and control.
Driven by the nonignorable presence of asymptomatic transmission of the COVID-19 disease, we
present a new dynamic model for the spread of infection by partitioning the infectious compartment
of the traditional SIR model into three parts, i.e., asymptomatic cases, pathologically infected but
unconfirmed cases, and confirmed cases.
Another crucial factor is dynamic human mobility in formulating the spread of the COVID19 pandemic, driven by the effectiveness of isolating the spread of COVID-19 through lockdown
of Wuhan city before the Chinese Spring Festival. The key initiative of such an extreme public
health intervention ahead of major public holidays was to cut off the massive human movement

2

between Wuhan and surrounding cities. The spread of virus was controlled, with evidence that
the reproductive number Rt decreased over time t, by 2.7-3.8 before January 26 to less than 1.0
after February 6, and less than 0.3 after March 1 [Pan(2020)]. This encourages us to incorporate dynamic spreading patterns within the spatial framework of the human mobility network
[Brockmann(2013)]. The predictability of the spread of infectious disease could be improved by
characterizing the geographical spread of epidemics [Rvachev(1985), Hufnagel(2004)]. Population
flowing out of Wuhan has been incorporated to predict the risk and distribution of confirmed cases
spatially [Jia(2011)]. Geographical dispersion of an epidemic through human mobility has also been
successfully applied to forecast the spreading of SARS 2003 and H1N1 2009 [Brockmann(2013)],
whereas the mobility parameter was fixed as a constant on all nodes. Such constant mobility
assumption is reasonable for SARS 2003 but not applicable for COVID-19 because the latter infectious disease is more contagious and there is much more intense human mobility in 2020 compared
to 13 years ago [Callaway(2020)].
In expanding the SIR model to our proposed SaucIR model, our main concerns focus on two
aspects: (1) the division of infectious compartment into three separate segments, and (2) dynamic
human mobility by separating the group size of migration in and out of a node within a network. It
improves the prediction fidelity as shown in our simulation results. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that it is possible to control the confirmed cases by reducing aggregation of migration among nodes
in the human mobility network.
The remainder is organized as below. In Section 2, we give the formulation of the new SaucIR
model for the spread of COVID-19 based on its epidemiological characteristics and dynamic geographical spread. We present a practical way to measure dynamic human mobility and suggest
optimal enhancement for public control strategies. In Section 3, we apply the SaucIR model to
estimate and predict the confirmed cases in mainland China and in worldwide countries with severe infections. In Section 4, we assess the predictive accuracy by comparing the proposed and the
existing resembling models.

Formulation of new spread model of COVID-19

In this section, we formulate the predictive spread model of COVID-19 involving key factors
driven from the epidemiological characteristics such as asymptomatic cases and dynamic human
mobility within a network of coupled populations. We start from the following dynamics model
[Brockmann(2013)] describing the local disease time course on each node based on the conventional
SIR model:
αIn Sn
,
Nn
αIn Sn
∂t In =
− β0 In ,
Nn
∂t Sn = −

3

n = 1, . . . , M,

(2.1)

where Sn and In represent the numbers of susceptible and infected individuals on node n in a
network of people flow with a total of M nodes, respectively, Nn is the population size of node
n, Rn = Nn − Sn − In represents the number of recovered or deceased on node n, α is the mean
infection rate of individuals, β0 is the mean recovery rate of individuals, and ∂t Xn stands for the
partial derivative of the population size of state X on node n with respect to time t in a time
course with X being the place holder for S, I, or any other disease state alphabet in the modeling
thereafter. The epidemiological threshold R0 = α/β is an indication of the transmissibility of a
virus, governing the time evolution of the aforementioned equations.

2.1

Segmenting the infectious compartment

One of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 that is remarkably different from existing
infectious diseases such as SARS is the existence of asymptomatic carriers. Hence, symptom-based
screening alone failed to detect a high proportion of infectious cases for asymptomatic persons and
was not enough to control transmission. The probable asymptomatic transmission will not be
known for sure unless an antibody test is applied. The risk of asymptomatic transmission cannot be ignored because of a large number of asymptomatic carriers [Mizumoto(2020), Bai(2020),
Lee(2020)]. Thus, it is reasonable to segment the asymptomatic infected COVID-19 carriers independently in the infectious compartment. As a result, the infectious compartment is partitioned
into two segments, i.e., the asymptomatic (A) and the symptomatic. Additionally, the symptomatic
segment exposes to dynamic process and is stratified into two stages, i.e., pathologically infected
but unconfirmed (U ) and confirmed (C). That is, the infectious group first experiences the onset
of symptoms, then it may be confirmed clinically after a time lag, called the incubation period.
Thereafter, the confirmed group will be isolated for therapy in the hospital and lose its transmissibility. The incubation period is contagious in our compartmental model [Li(2020)], which is in
line with the existing assumption for modeling the spread of the SARS epidemic [Chowell(2003)].
The infectivity during the incubation period for COVID-19 is critical for controlling the disease
[Liu(2020)]. As a result of the newly segmented infectious compartment, the R (recovered or deceased) compartment composes of two parts, recovered or deceased (R1 ) from the symptomatic
compartment or recovered (R2 ) from the asymptomatic compartment accordingly. The formulated
contagion pattern is summarized in Figure 1 to illustrate the spread dynamics.

Figure 1: Progression flow of COVID-19. The parameters within the figure are illustrated in the
adjacent paragraph.

4

Next, we analyze the key epidemiological parameters in Figure 1. The parameter α denotes the
transmission rate from susceptible to infected, θ denotes the probability that susceptible individuals
turn to be asymptomatically infected, ζ denotes the rate that a person in the incubation period
turns to be confirmed clinically, and β denotes the recovery rate from symptomatically confirmed
to recovered or deceased. For the symptomatic segment, the time lag from U to C is taken as
5 days, the average incubation period in the literature [Lauer(2020)]. Our simulations show that
the incubation period of 3 to 5 days is not sensitive to the proposed model. For the progression
from asymptomatic (A) to recovered (R2 ), the time lag 21 days corresponds to the maximal
observation of the communicable period of asymptomatic carriers, counted from the first day of
positive nucleic acid test to the first day of the continuous negative tests of an asymptomatic
carrier [Bai(2020)]. There are very few references for the interval length of the communicable
period of asymptomatic carriers to the pandemic spread [Hu(2020)]. Our simulation results show
that the scope of 9-21 days will not affect much of the accuracy of the proposed model in Section
3.1. The aforementioned consideration of epidemiological characteristics is summarized in the
following compartmental model on node n,
αn (Un + An )Sn
,
Nn
αn (Un + An )Sn
∂t Un =
(1 − θ) − ζn Unt−5 ,

∂t Sn = −

(2.2)

∂t R1n = βn Cn ,
∂t R2n = At−21
,
n

n = 1, . . . , M,

where An represents the group size of asymptomatic cases, Un and Cn are group sizes of infected but
not yet confirmed clinically and confirmed clinically in the symptomatic segment, respectively, R1n
and R2n denote the removed cases from symptomatic and asymptomatic segments, respectively,
αn denotes the average infection rate for population n in the network, βn denotes the average
recovery rate of individuals from confirmed clinically under therapy to recovered on node n, and
R1n = Nn − Sn − (Un + An + Cn ) − R2n .
Notice that for population n in a network, the accumulated confirmed cases, denoted as D,
is the sum of the clinically confirmed under therapy (C) and the recovered or deceased from
symptomatic cases (R1 ). Thereafter,
∂t Dn = ζn Unt−5
(2.3)
will replace the bi-interrelated variation equations in the system of equations (2.2) in the final
dynamic model.

2.2

Dynamic human mobility

We now incorporate the impact of population flow onto the modeling of the infectious spread of
COVID-19. To guarantee the prediction fidelity, we distinguish the group size of people emanating
from a node m in and out of another node n, and hence, the distinct human mobility rates of
moving in and out of a node n. This is a quite practical strategy considering the difference among
nodes. Let X be a placeholder for the compartments S, U , and A. The infection variation for
population n comes from two sources, local and migration,
∂t Xn = ∂t Xn,local + ∂t Xn,migration ,

(2.4)

where the first summand ∂t Xn,local on the right side of equation (2.4) represents the dynamic local
disease time course on node n by equations (2.2) and (2.3). Next, we will elucidate the formulating
of ∂t Xn,migration based on parameters of dynamic human mobility.
P
Let Fnm be the group size of people emanating from node m to node n. Denote Fn· = m Fnm
P
and F·m = n Fnm . Let γnin = Fn· /Nn be the proportion of the group size moving in destination n
(Fn· ) to the population size of node n (Nn ), and γnout = F·n /Nn be the proportion of group size of
in
people leaving node n (F·n ) to the population size of node n. Let Pnm
= Fnm /Fn· be the proportion
of group size emanating from node m in destination n to the group size moving in destination n;
out
let Pmn
= Fmn /F·n be the proportion of group size leaving node n for another node m to the group
in
out
size emanating from node n. Let Pnn
= 0 = Pnn
. Under the setting of such human mobility
measurements, the variation of the susceptible within our spread model of COVID-19 satisfies

X
in
in αm (Um + Am )Sm

(2.5)

Notice that, when there is no geometrical difference in transmission, denoted as γnin = γnout ≡ γ
for any node n, and there is no infection during the migration, denoted as αm = 0, our proposed
equation (2.5) reduces to the representation of ∂t Sn in the literature [Brockmann(2013)].
For Un and An , one cannot ignore the infection owing to human mobility among nodes in the

6

geometrical network. The correspondent dynamic processes can be presented as follows:
∂t Un,migration
M 

where αm denotes the rate of infection at node m other than node n.
Based on the spirit of equation (2.4), we can further update the dynamic model (2.2) by
combining (2.3), (2.5), and (2.6) into (2.2).

2.3

The SaucIR-model

To formulate the final SaucIR model, we still need to further refine some nested parameters to
enhance predictivity. In a network, the prevention and control policies of different nodes should
lead to spatially varying epidemic parameters.
First of all, we will add the effects of quarantine into the modeling of the contagion pattern of
COVID-19 [Chowell(2003)]. In mainland China, during the COVID-19 pandemic, most provinces
have announced officially the detailed confirmed cases and labeled whether the specific case was
once quarantined. This information is beneficial for estimating the quarantine rate parameter ln
as the ratio of the size of quarantine labeled cases against the total number of confirmed cases
of COVID-19 disease for population n. Still in modeling the spread of SARS by the literature
[Chowell(2003)], ln changes over time. Varying ln is effective in the situation where there exist
inflection points, validated by Figure 4 in literature [Chowell(2003)], whereas it is not significant
for our proposed model, as confirmed by the simulations summarized in Table 11 and Figure 3.
The other focus of our study is the correction of the transmission rate αm for the migration
process. The transmission rate function is no doubt time and nodal dependent. Let τn be a decay
constant on node n. The general exponential tilt expression
αn (t) = αn (0) · e−τn t

(2.7)

is an acceptable functional to act in the local infectious process [Chen(2020)] in which the prevention and control in local governments can effectively help prevent the spread of contagion.
However, the monotone decreasing function (2.7) is not suitable to apply in the migration process
7

owing to unprecedented human mobility. Conservatively, we uniformly apply the nodal function
αn (t) to behave as the transmission rate function in the migration part of the final model.
All of the above considerations lead to the final SaucIR model illustrating the infection progression:

The epidemic parameters ln , αn , and ζn are estimated from the announced epidemic data by the
provinces. The initial value of Sn is the population size of every node. The initial value of Dn
is the number of cumulative confirmed cases each day. The initial value of Un is the sum of new
diagnoses in the next six days. The initial value of An is the total number of new diagnoses in the
next six days multiplied by θ/(1 − θ).

2.4

Prevention and control strategy

In this subsection, we explore whether human mobility can be modified among nodes in a network
to control or minimize the accumulated confirmed cases in a district over a certain time interval.

Let DnT be the confirmed cases on node n up to day T . Denote any local coupled populations
in the network as S = {1, · · · , K}, and all populations in the network as S0 = {1, · · · , M }, where
K ≤ M . The migration-related parameters introduced before Section 2.3 on a specific day t are

To modify parameters of human mobility among nodes in the network, for any pairwise nodes n
and m, one natural constraint is to keep a constant relationship between the group size emanating
from node n with population size Nn and out of another node m with population size Nm , so that
the optimization problem may be presented as

For the optimization problem (2.10), we assume that the mobility group will not change the epidemic parameters αn (t), βn , ln , and θ on node n. To solve the optimization problem (2.10),
we employ the general genetic algorithm [Deb(1999)]. Here are notations involved in the algoout

listed as below:
1. Individual: a matrix shaped as (T, M, M), where T and M correspond to (γP )in
nm,t and
out
(γP )mn,t , respectively, for t ∈ [0, T ] and n, m ∈ S0 .
2. Population: a collection of individuals.
3. Fitness: a description of how good an individual fits the environment, and in our study, how

individuals that are more likely to correspond to better fitness.
Algorithm 1 provides the steps for minimizing the accumulated confirmed cases within any

Based on the SaucIR model (2.8), one may use Algorithms 1 and 2 to solve the minimization
problem (2.10). Notice that the four tuning rate parameters are ratios among F·m , Fn· , Nn , Nm ,
and Fnm . Therefore, governmental management may have a proper intervention on the migration
size within a sub-network for the purpose of preventing and controlling the spread of COVID-19.

Numerical analysis and forecasting

In this section, we use the data of confirmed cases within the human mobility networks in mainland
China and the international community to analyze the predictive fidelity of the SaucIR spread
model (2.8) of COVID-19. To assess the accuracy of prediction, we adopt two assessment indices,
10

max absolute percent error (MAPE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) with mathematical
expressions

respectively, where t0 is the number of days of a prediction period with daily unity to count time,
and the superscripts “pred” and “real” denote predicted and real, respectively. MAPE reflects
the maximal daily percentage error out of the total number of infections over the forecasting time
period, whereas RMSE measures the averaged headcount error over the forecasting time period.
The prediction is more accurate with lower levels of such errors.

In the following analysis, we first evaluate the effects of components of the model and the

proposed SaucIR model and compare the prediction result based on the epidemic and migration

the proportion of asymptomatic carriers and the communicable period of asymptomatic carriers.
On one hand, we conduct simulations studying the effects of different levels of the rate of asymptomatic people (θ) on the prediction accuracy. The results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The
values of θ may be different spatially. Our simulation results assess and show that the SaucIR
model works well when θ takes values between 0.15 to 0.45 in terms of MAPE and RMSE. Both
MAPE and RMSE show a similar pattern, such that the measure error first decreases and then
increases as θ varies starting from 0.05 and upward to 0.45. The bottom points of θ of measurement
errors are slightly different among provinces. Thus, it may be concluded that θ affects the error of
the predicted results but the prediction accuracy may be guaranteed when it is controlled under
0.45. Hence, we uniformly use 0.25 as the rate of the asymptomatic infected group to analyze the
predictive fidelity of the proposed model. Another observation is that the supercity Beijing has
relatively larger values of MAPE and RMSE, which are highly likely due to the relatively extensive
amount of imported cases based on the news and media report. On the other hand, we validate it
is reasonable to take 21 days as the communicable period of asymptomatic carriers. We conduct
a sensitivity analysis to compare the effect of selecting different communicable period on the prediction accuracy. According to the literature [Hu(2020)], we select the length of time consisting of
6-21 days in the simulations. Both RMSE and MAPE reflect that the prediction error is smaller
in most areas when the length of time varies between 9 and 21 (Tables 7 and 9), and the effect of
the value on the prediction error is small (Tables 8 and 10).
Secondly, we evaluate the sensitivity of the incubation period in the symptomatic process. We
conduct a sensitivity analysis to check whether the spread results change substantially for various
incubation period. Considering the incubation period in the literature [Lauer(2020)], we take 3 to
7 days on the spread of the disease. Both RMSE and MAPE reflect that the incubation period
corresponding to the best forecast varies from region to region. When the incubation period is
between 3 and 5 days, the forecast error is small in most areas (Tables 3 and 5), and the effect
of changing incubation period in this interval is small (Tables 4 and 6). Consequently, 5 days is
acceptable uniformly.
Next, we use simulations to compare the effect of choosing different ln . As mentioned in Section
2.3, it is reasonable to keep ln constant over time. Because there are no inflection points in Figure
3, and the gains from making ln change over time come mainly from the inflection point. We then
15

use simulations to compare the effect of choosing different ln fixed with time. Since the estimated
ln varies between 0.4 and 0.6 in the real data, we consider three values of ln (i.e., 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6)
for each node. Both MAPE and RMSE show that the model is insensitive to the value of ln (Table
11).

Finally, we evaluate the prediction performance of our method through simulations. We demonstrate that the proposed segmentation of the infection compartment significantly improves the prediction accuracy and that the incorporation of dynamic human mobility apparently enhances the
prediction accuracy. We use SIR+M to denote model (3) in the literature [Brockmann(2013)], and
use SIR and SaucIR-M to denote models (2.1) (without further segmentation) and (2.2) (without
dynamic human mobility) in Section 2.1, respectively. The comparison results are summarized in
Tables 12 and 13. The predicted RMSE is in single digits except for Zhejiang, Guangdong, and
Hunan.
Figure 3 shows the real numbers of confirmed cases and the fitted numbers of confirmed cases
by SIR+M and our method during the period from January 24 to February 15, 2020, and forecast
numbers of confirmed cases for the next three days. In both the SIR+M and our method, the real
numbers of confirmed cases from January 24 to February 15, 2020 are used to estimate epidemic
parameters. In most provinces, the forecast accumulated numbers of confirmed cases by SIR+M
are generally larger than the real magnitudes. Our conjecture is, in SIR+M, the decrease of the
transmission rate α is the main factor that affects the slowdown in the growth of the number of
confirmed cases, whereas in SaucIR, the group sizes of the segments U and A will take effects
simultaneously together with the transmission rate α. Notice that, the partition of I into A
and U + C shown in Figure 1 implies that the size of the infectious compartment in SaucIR is
smaller than that in SIR+M because the group of C loses transmissibility owing to isolation for
therapy. Also, the forecasting results by SaucIR are closer to the real numbers compared to those
by SIR+M in most provinces because of the involvement of multiple factors of the epidemic and
16

human mobility.

3.2

Prediction in the international network of human mobility

In this subsection, we use the international air transport network to demonstrate the predictive
ability of the proposed SaucIR model. We use the accumulated confirmed cases from February 24
to May 18, 2020 to fit the epidemic parameters and predict the confirmed cases from May 19 to
May 21, 2020 for the seven severely infected countries. Confirmed cases and human mobility data
of countries that ranked in the top six of confirmed cases and South Korea are analyzed. See page
4 of [Worldwide-Infection-Data]. Confirmed cases are announced by countries. The population
mobility data are obtained by the airport announcements (c.f. [Migration]). As the quarantines of
people (unconfirmed cases U and asymptomatic carriers A) are not announced to the public, we
set ln = 0. Then, we can calculate the number of confirmed cases in the future using model (2.8).
Table 14 compares the predicted results and the real data during May 19-21. Evidently, our
prediction has smaller relative prediction errors. Figure 4 graphically displays the predicted curves
by our method and the SIR+M together with the observed values for seven countries during
the period from February 24 to May 21. In those countries where SIR+M fits well, the fitting
and forecasting are well consistent with the characteristics we mentioned in Section 3.1. For
those countries where SIR+M does not fit well (e.g., France), the reason could be that not all
infected persons can be tested immediately [Biotechnology(2020)] so that the cumulative number
of confirmed cases and the number of infected people are not exactly the same. Our method is more
capable to reflect this due to the segmentation of U + C. Therefore, our method has forecasting
results closer to the real data, with the maximal MAPE of 0.011.

3.3

Impact of migration on confirmed cases

In this subsection, we study how the migration scales affect the confirmed cases. The epidemiological parameters and mobility parameters involved in the dynamic SaucIR model (2.8) are
calculated or fitted based on the migration data obtained from the Baidu website and epidemic
data announced officially from Janruary 24 to February 29, 2020.
in
out
The migration scale (Cnm,T
and Cnm,T
) is categorized into three levels, where the large and
medium scales are triple and twice of the small scale. Using optimal procedure (2.10), the coverage
of confirmed cases can be obtained under various migration scales.
Table 15 summarizes the predicted confirmed cases on the nodes in the 11-province human
mobility network of mainland China. Vertically, in the same scope of migration scale, the estimates confirmed cases do not vary much between the minimum and maximum. This implies
that modifying the emanating rates from a node in or out of another node within the network
has a minor impact on controlling the transmission rate. Horizontally, a smaller migration scale,
less confirmed cases. This may be evidence of the validity of Wuhan lockdown for preventing the
spread of COVID-19.

Conclusion and Discussion

Compared to the SIR model raised in [Brockmann(2013)], our SaucIR model is disease specific
for the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary difference is that the infection compartment has an independent segment of asymptomatic infected individuals based on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. The numerical results indicate that such re-compartment
is critical and substantial. By the time our revised manuscript was submitted, we found more

studies on asymptomatic with considerable proportions up to 58% among patients with infection, justifying the rationale of independent A segment in the proposed compartmental model.
The rate of asymptomatic per sons in population-based retrospective studies can even reach 43%
[Gudbjartsson(2020)]. It remains a series of unsolved problems regarding the asymptomatic patients in COVID-19 that are anticipating more epidemiological observations and experiments,
such as pattern of infectiveness, accurate communicable period, effective surveillance and screening [Lee(2020)]. The next distinction is that we present a dynamic migration procedure rather
than fixing the mobility parameters. Baidu migration data source makes it feasible for modeling
and computing. The advantage of such dynamic human mobility makes it possible to take into
consideration of infection during the procedures of migration in and out of a spatial node, achieving
the predictive fidelity of the proposed SaucIR model. On the other hand, it validates the necessity
of the separation of moving in and out of the same node from other nodes in the modeling. The
minor difference is that we use the absolute flux of population rather than the fraction of the
passenger flux. The big population size of the provinces in China brings out a fraction of each

19

compartment far less than unity, which has impact on the prediction accuracy. We need to point
out that our modeling uses newly published parameters such as incubation days of infected to the
symptom and asymptomatic to recovered. Modeling the spread pattern is an important issue and
could be updated when there are new and reliable epidemic parameters.
The COVID-19 pandemic has not ended yet. The forecasting SaucIR model will benefit the
public health authorities to assess the epidemic situation, make reasonably informed decisions,
take appropriate interventions, and give a timely control of infection.
