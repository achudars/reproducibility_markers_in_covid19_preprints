Abstract
Background: By the beginning of December 2020, some vaccines against COVID-19
already presented efficacy and security, which qualify them to be used in mass vaccination
campaigns. Thus, setting up strategies of vaccination became crucial to control the COVID19 pandemic.

Methods: We use daily COVID-19 reports from Chicago and NYC from 01-Mar2020 to 28Nov-2020 to estimate the parameters of an SEIR-like epidemiological model that accounts
for different severity levels. To achieve data adherent predictions, we let the model
parameters to be time-dependent. The model is used to forecast different vaccination
scenarios, where the campaign starts at different dates, from 01-Oct-2020 to 01-Apr-2021.

To generate realistic scenarios, disease control strategies are implemented whenever the
number of predicted daily hospitalizations reaches a preset threshold.

Results: The model reproduces the empirical data with remarkable accuracy. Delaying the
vaccination severely affects the mortality, hospitalization, and recovery projections. In
Chicago, the disease spread was under control, reducing the mortality increment as the start
of the vaccination was postponed. In NYC, the number of cases was increasing, thus, the
estimated model predicted a much larger impact, despite the implementation of contention
measures.

The earlier the vaccination campaign begins, the larger is its potential impact in reducing the
COVID-19 cases, as well as in the hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, the rate at which
cases, hospitalizations and deaths increase with the delay in the vaccination beginning
strongly depends on the shape of the incidence of infection in each city.

Introduction

Previous pandemics have demonstrated that, as a general rule, pharmaceutical interventions
are less important than non-pharmaceutical intervention in controlling the infection,
however, there is a possibility that this will not be the case with the vaccines against COVID19 [1–3].

2

Some few months after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China, several academic
laboratories and pharmaceutical industries around the world started the development of more
than 100 types of different vaccines, short-circuiting in less than one year the usual time
frame of new vaccines development and testing of around ten years [3,4].
There is, therefore, an enormous variety of COVID-19 vaccines being developed. As of
November 2020, there were 48 vaccines in clinical trials and 146 candidate vaccines in preclinical evaluation [5]. Of these, 12 vaccines were in the pipeline, of which ten were in Phase
3 of clinical trials (four have already completed this phase) and two were in Phase 2 [5]. In
the US, three vaccines completed Phase 3 trials, namely, Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca,
and two were still in Phase 3 [5].
In order to have a significant impact on the course of the pandemic, however, safe and
effective vaccines have to emerge in less time it would take the affected populations to reach
natural herd immunity [3]. Therefore, an unprecedented time-schedule to roll out any
effective vaccine is urgently needed.
In December 2020, the CDC proposed the Phase 1 allocation schedule of vaccination,
covering an estimated 264 million people in about 25 weeks from the beginning of
vaccination. Phase 1a would cover 21 million health personnel and three million nursing
residents. Phase 1b would cover 87 million essential workers, 100 million persons with risky
medical conditions and 53 million adults older than 65 years of age [6]. This ambitious
rolling out plan, however, is way behind schedule. By 7-Jan-2021, only about five million
people have been vaccinated [7].

3

We quantify the delay impact in vaccination deployment under different scenarios using
publicly available data. This is done by implementing a novel Susceptible-ExposedInfective-Recovered-like (SEIR) model that accounts for the different levels of disease
severity, asymptomatic infection, age range, and regime changes in disease spread. The
model captures well the time evolution of the outbreak leading to the forecast of realistic
scenarios. It is tested with publicly available data from Chicago and NYC confirming
adherence to historical data. We observe that according to the disease-spread control level,
the impact of postponing a mass vaccination campaign is considerable. Reopening strategies
after lockdown are also accounted for in our study.

It is worth mentioning that the politicization of the vaccination in many countries, the polemic
around safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccines and the anti-vaccination groups
campaigning against the vaccine are all contributing to hesitancy [8] and an inevitable delay
in vaccination in many places around the world (not to mention the technical hurdles to roll
out billions of doses necessary to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic). All these issues make
the estimation of the death toll caused by vaccination delay of utmost importance.

This section presents the epidemiological model as well as the estimation techniques used to
calibrate the model parameters from observed cases of COVID-19.

2.1

The Epidemiological SEIR-like Model

The proposed epidemiological model accounts for the distribution of the population into n
age ranges. For the ith age range, the corresponding group of individuals is further classified
into nine compartments, namely, susceptible (S), vaccinated (V), exposed (E), asymptomatic
and infective (IA), mildly infective (IM), severely infective (IS), critically infective (IC),
recovered (R), and deceased (D). All infective individuals that are symptomatic but do not
need to be hospitalized are considered mildly infective. By severely infective we mean those
individuals that were admitted to a regular hospital bed. Those individuals that were admitted
to an intensive care unit (ICU) are considered as critically infective. Only susceptible
individuals are considered vaccinated, which means that if someone is vaccinated after being
exposed, then he or she will pass to the asymptomatic or mildly infective compartments.
Before presenting the model, let us introduce the vector notation, i.e.,
𝐒 = [𝑆 1 , ⋯ , 𝑆 𝑛 ]𝑇 ,
where 𝑆 𝑖 (𝑖 = 1, ⋯ , 𝑛) represents the susceptible individuals in the ith age range. 𝐄, 𝐕, 𝐈𝐴 ,
𝐈𝑀 , 𝐈𝑆 , 𝐈𝐶 , 𝐑, and 𝐃 are defined similarly. Also consider the tensor product between two ndimensional vectors, defined as
𝐗: 𝐘 = [𝑥1 𝑦 1 , ⋯ , 𝑥 𝑛 𝑦 𝑛 ]𝑇 .
Thus, the movement between the model compartments is determined by the following system
of ordinary differential equations:
𝐒̇ = −𝐒: (𝛽𝐴 𝐈𝐴 + 𝛽𝑀 𝐈𝑀 + 𝛽𝑆 𝐈𝑆 + 𝛽𝐶 𝐈𝐶 ) − 𝜈: 𝐒,
𝐕̇ = ν: 𝐒,

(1)

𝐄̇ = 𝐒: (𝛽𝐴 𝐈𝐴 + 𝛽𝑀 𝐈𝑀 + 𝛽𝑆 𝐈𝑆 + 𝛽𝐶 𝐈𝐶 ) − σ𝐄,
𝐈̇𝐴 = (1 − 𝑝)𝜎𝐄 − 𝛾𝑅,𝐴 : 𝐈𝐴 ,

(4)

𝐈̇𝑀 = 𝑝𝜎𝐄 − (𝛾𝑅,𝑀 + 𝛼𝑆 ): 𝐈𝑀 ,
𝐈̇𝑆 = 𝛼𝑆 : 𝐈𝑀 − (𝛾𝑅,𝑆 + 𝛼𝐶 ): 𝐈𝑆 ,

(5)

𝐈̇𝐶 = 𝛼𝐶 : 𝐈𝑆 − (𝛾𝑅,𝐶 + 𝛿𝐷 ): 𝐈𝐶 ,

(7)

𝐑̇ = 𝛾𝑅,𝐴 : 𝐈𝐴 + 𝛾𝑅,𝑀 : 𝐈𝑀 + 𝛾𝑅,𝑆 : 𝐈𝑆 + 𝛾𝑅,𝐶 : 𝐈𝐶 ,
𝐃̇ = 𝛿𝐷 : 𝐈𝐶 .
The schematic representation of the model can be found in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the epidemiological model of Eqs. (1)-(9).

The time-dependent transmission parameters for asymptomatic, mildly, severely, and
critically infective individuals are denoted, respectively, by 𝛽𝐴 , 𝛽𝑀 , 𝛽𝑆 , and 𝛽𝐶 . The rate of
vaccination is 𝜈, which is given by the product of the daily rate of vaccination of susceptible
individuals by the effectiveness of the used vaccine. The meantime from contagion to become
infective is the inverse of the parameter 𝜎. The recovery rate of mildly, severely, critical and
asymptomatic infective individuals are denoted by 𝛾𝑅,𝑀 , 𝛾𝑅,𝑆 , 𝛾𝑅,𝐶 , and 𝛾𝑅,𝐴 , respectively.
The rates of hospitalization and ICU admission are denoted by 𝛼𝑆 and 𝛼𝐶 , respectively.
According to the World Health Organization, only people in severe conditions generally die
by COVID-19, thus, the corresponding death rate is 𝛿𝐷 [9].
The unknown parameters are 𝛽𝐴 , 𝛽𝑀 , 𝛽𝑆 , and 𝛽𝐶 , as well as the initial number of mildly and
asymptomatic infective individuals, that shall be estimated from the daily numbers of
infections. In order to reduce the number of unknowns, we assume that

6

𝛽𝑆 = 𝑎𝛽𝑀 , 𝛽𝐶 = 𝑏𝛽𝑀 , and 𝛽𝐴 = 𝑐𝛽𝑀 ,

(10)

with 𝑎 = 0.1 , 𝑏 = 0.01 , and 𝑐 = 0.58 , which means that the infection rate of
hospitalized, in ICU and asymptomatic individuals are 10%, 1% and 58%, respectively, of
the transmission rate of those ones in the mildly infective compartment [10,11]. The mean
time between infection and becoming infective is set to 5.1 [12]. The proportion of exposed
individuals becoming mildly infective is 𝑝, which is set to 0.83 [11]. The recovery rates of
mildly, severely, and critically infective individuals are simply set as one minus the rates of
hospitalization, ICU admission, and death, respectively. All the asymptomatic individuals
will recover in 14 days, so, 𝛾𝑅,𝐴 = 14−1 . The rate of ICU admission is set as 𝛼𝐶 = 0.4 [13].
The hospitalization and death rates are time-dependent and defined as follows:
𝐻(𝑡)

𝛼𝑆 (𝑡) = 𝐼(𝑡−1)

and

𝛿𝐷 (𝑡) =

𝐷(𝑡)
𝛼𝐶 𝐻(𝑡−1)

(11)

where 𝐼 , 𝐻, and 𝐷 represent the time series of seven-day moving averages of daily numbers
of infections, hospitalizations and deaths, respectively.
If the number of age ranges n is larger than one, the entries of the matrix 𝛽𝑀 are defined
as:
[𝛽𝑀 ]𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽 𝑖 (𝑡)𝑏𝑖 , [𝛽𝑀 ]𝑖𝑗 =

𝑝𝑗
2

(𝛽 𝑖 (𝑡)𝑏𝑖 + 𝛽 𝑗 (𝑡)𝑏𝑗 ), 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗 (𝑖, 𝑗 = 1, ⋯ , 𝑛),

where 𝛽 𝑖 (𝑡) (𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝑛) are time-dependent scalar coefficients, and 𝑏𝑖 , as well as 𝑝𝑖 (𝑖 =
1, . . . , 𝑛) are time-independent [10]. 𝛽 𝑖 (𝑡) represents the time-dependent part of the
transmission coefficient for the ith age range, whereas 𝑏𝑖 is the time-independent part. They,
respectively, capture the short-term and the long-term pattern of the disease spread. The
parameter 𝑝𝑖 represents the probability of any individual from the jth age range to interact
with an individual from the (𝑖 + 𝑗 – 1)th age range. In this case, we set 𝑝1 = 1. Under these
assumptions, the number of unknown parameters in 𝛽𝑀 , for each 𝑡, is 2𝑛, instead of 𝑛2 − 𝑛.

Estimation Techniques

As aforementioned, the set of unknown parameters is composed by the initial number of
𝑛

individuals at the mildly infective individuals 𝐈𝑀 (0) = [𝐼𝑀
(0), ⋯ , 𝐼𝑀
(0)]𝑇 , the time-

dependent components of the matrix 𝛽𝑀 , 𝛽⃗ (𝑡) = [𝛽1 (𝑡), ⋯ , 𝛽𝑛 (𝑡)]𝑇 , and the timeindependent components of 𝛽𝑀 , 𝐛 = [𝑏1 , ⋯ , 𝑏𝑛 ]𝑇 and 𝐩 = [1, 𝑝2 , ⋯ , 𝑝𝑛 ]𝑻 . Let ℑ𝑖 =
{ℐ𝑖 (𝑡1 ), . . . , ℐ𝑖 (𝑡𝑁 )} represent the time series of seven-day moving averaged version of daily
reports of COVID-19 infections for the ith age range. The estimation procedure is performed
in two steps. In the first one, the time-independent parameters, 𝐈𝑀 (0) and 𝐛, are estimated
and, in the second one, 𝛽⃗ (𝑡) is calibrated.
The estimated 𝐈𝑀 (0) and 𝐛 are minimizers of the objective function below, which is
closely related to the so-called posterior density of the model parameters, given the set of
reports [14].
Π(𝐈𝑀 (0), 𝐛, 𝐩|ℑ1 , ⋯ , ℑ𝑛 ) = 𝐿(ℑ1 , ⋯ , ℑ𝑛 |𝐈𝑀 (0), 𝐛, 𝐩) + 𝛼𝑃𝑟(𝐈𝑀 (0), 𝐛, 𝐩), (12)

The set of time-dependent components of 𝛽𝑀 , 𝛽⃗ (𝑡) is estimated by minimizing the

The minimization of the objective functions above is performed by a gradient-based
technique [15]. Confidence intervals (CIs) are generated by bootstrapping, based on a set of
200 samples [16].

Results

This section presents the comparison between model predictions and reported data after
calibration, as well as vaccination scenarios created with the calibrated model using data from
Chicago and New York City (NYC).

3.1

Estimation Results

The parameters of the epidemiological model of Eqs. (1)-(9) are estimated from seven-day
moving average time-series of daily new infections from Chicago and NYC. The timeseries of daily reports of COVID-19 infections, as well as related hospitalizations and
deaths for Chicago and NYC, are available from public resources [17,18]. Recent census
data containing the total population of the considered cities and their distributions by age
ranges were also used [19].
During the model estimation, the time series were divided into sets of consecutive 20
days. Besides the set corresponding to the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in these
cities, for each 20-day dataset, 𝐛 and 𝛽⃗ (𝑡) are estimated. We start by not distributing the
population into age ranges, which means that n is set to 1 in the model of Eqs. (1)-(9). The
time-dependent effective reproduction number denoted by ℛ(𝑡) is evaluated through the
next-generation matrix technique [20,21].
Model prediction using estimated parameters of daily new cases, hospitalizations and
deaths, as well as the corresponding reported numbers for Chicago and NYC for the period
01-Mar-2020 to 28-Nov-2020 can be found in Figures 2-3, respectively. The corresponding
effective reproduction numbers are also presented.

The bars represent the reports and the envelopes are 90% CIs. The corresponding seven-day moving average
of the time-dependent basic reproduction rate is depicted in the bottom right panel.

For both cities, the model predictions of daily new cases, hospitalizations and deaths (in
Figure 2, top left and right, as well as bottom left panels, respectively) are adherent to the
reports. It is explained by the effectiveness of the calibration procedure, and the use of the
hospitalization and death rates defined in Eq. (11). We decided to present the seven-day
moving average of ℛ(𝑡) since it is less fuzzy, allowing to see the qualitative trend of the
spread dynamics, such as the effectiveness of control measures. The periods when control
measures effectively reduced the number of new COVID-19 infections are illustrated by the
graph of ℛ(𝑡), where, during such dates, its value remained below one (solid horizontal line).

3.2

Vaccination Scenarios

Let us consider that a vaccination campaign is implemented in Chicago and NYC. The
vaccine is 95% effective. Firstly, during the campaign, on each day, 1% of the susceptible
population is immunized, until the number of susceptible individuals is less than 40%. This
threshold was chosen based on an estimate of the proportion of US citizens that accept to get
a vaccine against COVID-19 [22].

Figure 3: Model predictions of infections, hospitalizations and deaths (solid lines), using data from NYC. The
bars represent the reports and the envelopes are 90% CIs. The corresponding seven-day moving average of the
time-dependent basic reproduction rate is depicted in the bottom right panel.

In order to forecast scenarios, the time-dependent parameters are extended to the forecast
period by repeating the average of the values estimated in the last ten days of the calibration
period. To avoid unrealistic numbers, whenever the predicted number of daily
12

hospitalizations reaches the value 300, the time-dependent transmission coefficient 𝛽(𝑡) is
set to the average of the values estimated in the period 07-Sept-2020 to 16-Sept-2020, when
the disease spread was controlled. In this period, the effective reproduction numbers in
Figures 2-3 were close to the value one, indicating that the disease spread was under control.
The vaccination campaign is set in the period 01-Oct-2020 to 31-May-2021, starting on
different dates, but finishing at 31-May-2020. Table 1 shows the accumulated numbers of
infections, hospitalizations and deaths corresponding to the different starting dates.
The evolution of the number of accumulated deaths with respect to the starting date of the
vaccination campaign can be found in Figure 4. The increasing number of deaths, as the
beginning of the campaign is postponed, also illustrate that vaccination must start as soon as
possible.

Discussion

In this paper, to generate vaccination scenarios, we propose an SEIR-like model that accounts
for the different levels of disease severity, asymptomatic infection, age range, and regime
changes in disease spread as times goes by. The model parameters are calibrated from reports
of daily COVID-19 infections, as well as published reports. We end-up with a modeling tool
that captures well the time evolution of the outbreak, reproducing the empirical data with
remarkable accuracy, helping to forecast realistic scenarios. Such features are illustrated
using publicly available data from Chicago and NYC.

14

Depending on, whether the disease spread is under control or not, that is, whether the daily
incidence curve of infection is increasing or decreasing, the impact of postponing the
beginning of a mass vaccination campaign is considerable. As expected, such impact is more
serious in regions where the incidence curve is increasing than in cities where the infection
is controlled.
We use different strategies and consider the implementation of contention measures, as the
daily reports of hospitalizations reach a threshold. Reopening strategies after lockdown are
also accounted for in our study.
The model has some important limitation worth mentioning. First, it assumes that 60% of
susceptible are vaccinated with a 95% efficacy vaccine in a short period of time at a rate of
1% per day. Although this scenario is logistically feasible, it is a daunting task.
The current scenario of the pandemic, in which new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are emerging
in some countries, should be considered in the simulation of future vaccination models [23].
However, there is not enough empirical evidence of the repercussion of these new variants
of the vaccine efficacy.
Finally, we should point out that the SARS-CoV-2, like any other viruses, is evolving, with
new strains showing increased transmissibility. It should be expected, however, that its case
fatality rate (or virulence) should be decreasing with time. This is a general rule in the
evolution of pathogens which helps them to increase their basic reproduction number [24]. If
this is the case, then it is possible to predict that in few years, COVID-19 tends to be a mild
disease as other coronaviruses, like OC-43 which probably caused the so-called “Russian flu”
in 1889 and nowadays is responsible for about 10% of the common cold [25]. The future of

15

vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, therefore, will very much depend on the virulence the virus
will eventually evolve.

We now simulate vaccination campaigns, starting on different dates, where people over 80
years old are immunized one month earlier than individuals in other age ranges. In addition,
people under 18 years old are not vaccinated. Again, we assume 95% of effectiveness of the
vaccine and the rate of vaccination of the population in the ith age range is 1%.

Table 3: Accumulated numbers of infections, hospitalizations and deaths in NYC, when the vaccination
campaign starts at different dates. Such values are based on model predictions using the estimated parameters
obtained in Section 3.1.

Table 3 presents the accumulated numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and
deaths, as well as of immunized individuals during the period 01-Nov-2020 to 31-May-2021
for NYC. As the starting date of the campaign is delayed, there is a remarkable increase in
the accumulated numbers.

Figure 6: Right: Evolution of the model predicted accumulated deaths in NYC with respect to the starting date
of the vaccination campaign. Left: increment in the accumulated deaths by postponing the starting date of the
vaccination campaign. The envelopes are 90% CIs.

The left panel in Figure 6 shows the evolution of the accumulated number of deaths as a
function of the vaccination campaign starting date. The right panel shows the increment in
the number of deaths for each starting date, in comparison to starting vaccination one month
earlier.
