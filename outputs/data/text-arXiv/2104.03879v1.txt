Abstract
The current COVID-19 pandemic has lead
to the creation of many corpora that facilitate NLP research and downstream applications to help fight the pandemic. However, most of these corpora are exclusively
for English. As the pandemic is a global
problem, it is worth creating COVID-19 related datasets for languages other than English.
In this paper, we present the first manuallyannotated COVID-19 domain-specific dataset
for Vietnamese. Particularly, our dataset is
annotated for the named entity recognition
(NER) task with newly-defined entity types
that can be used in other future epidemics.
Our dataset also contains the largest number
of entities compared to existing Vietnamese
NER datasets. We empirically conduct experiments using strong baselines on our dataset,
and find that: automatic Vietnamese word segmentation helps improve the NER results and
the highest performances are obtained by finetuning pre-trained language models where the
monolingual model PhoBERT for Vietnamese
(Nguyen and Nguyen, 2020) produces higher
results than the multilingual model XLM-R
(Conneau et al., 2020). We publicly release
our dataset at: https://github.com/
VinAIResearch/PhoNER_COVID19.

Introduction

As of early November 2020, the total number of
COVID-19 cases worldwide has surpassed 50M.1
The world is once again hit by a new wave of
COVID-19 infection with record-breaking numbers of new cases reported everyday. Along with
the outbreak of the pandemic, information about
the COVID-19 is aggregated rapidly through different types of texts in different languages (Aizawa
et al., 2020). Particularly, in Vietnam, text reports
containing official information from the government about COVID-19 cases are presented in great
1

detail, including de-identified personal information, travel history, as well as information of people
who come into contact with the cases. The reports
are frequently kept up to date at reputable online
news sources, playing a significant role to help the
country combat the pandemic. It is thus essential
to build systems to retrieve and condense information from those official sources so that related
people and organizations can promptly grasp the
key information for epidemic prevention tasks, and
the systems should also be able to adapt and sync
quickly with epidemics that take place in the future.
One of the first steps to develop such systems is to
recognize relevant named entities mentioned in the
texts, which is also known as the NER task.
Compared to other languages, data resources
for the Vietnamese NER task are limited, including only two public datasets from the VLSP 2016
and 2018 NER shared tasks (Huyen and Luong,
2016; Nguyen et al., 2018b). Here, the VLSP-2018
NER dataset is an extension of the VLSP-2016
NER dataset with more data. These two datasets
only focus on recognizing generic entities of person
names, organizations, and locations in online news
articles. Thus, making them difficult to adapt to the
context of extracting key entity information related
to COVID-19 patients. This leads to our work’s
main goals that are: (i) To develop a NER task in
the COVID-19 specified domain, that potentially
impacts research and downstream applications, and
(ii) To provide the research community with a new
dataset for recognizing COVID-19 related named
entities in Vietnamese.
In this paper, we present a named entity annotated dataset with newly-defined entity types that
can be applied to future epidemics. The dataset
contains informative sentences related to COVID19, extracted from articles crawled from reputable
Vietnamese online news sites. Here, we do not
consider other types of popular social media in
Vietnam such as Facebook as they contain much

the like, with structures and their own functions.
Symptoms that a patient experiences, and diseases that a patient had prior to
COVID-19 or complications that usually appear in death reports.

noisy information and are not as reliable as official
news sources. We then empirically evaluate strong
baseline models on our dataset. Our contributions
are summarized as follows:
• We introduce the first manually annotated
Vietnamese dataset in the COVID-19 domain. Our dataset is annotated with 10 different named entity types related to COVID19 patients in Vietnam.
Compared to
the VLSP-2016 and VLSP-2018 Vietnamese
NER datasets, our dataset has the largest number of entities, consisting of 35K entities over
10K sentences.
• We empirically investigate strong baselines
on our dataset, including BiLSTM-CNN-CRF
(Ma and Hovy, 2016) and the pre-trained language models XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020)
and PhoBERT (Nguyen and Nguyen, 2020).
We find that: (i) Automatic Vietnamese word
segmentation helps improve the NER results,
and (ii) The highest results are obtained by
fine-tuning the pre-trained language models,
where PhoBERT does better than XLM-R.
• We publicly release our dataset for research
or educational purposes. We hope that our
dataset can serve as a starting point for future
COVID-19 related Vietnamese NLP research
and applications.

Related work

Most COVID-19 related datasets are constructed
from two types of sources. The first one is scientific publications, including the datasets CORD19 (Wang et al., 2020) and LitCovid (Chen et al.,

2020), that help facilitate many types of research
works, such as building search engines to retrieve
relevant information from scholarly articles (Esteva
et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Verspoor et al.,
2020), question answering and summarization (Lee
et al., 2020; Su et al., 2020). Recently, Colic et al.
(2020) fine-tune a BERT-based NER model on the
CRAFT corpus (Verspoor et al., 2012) to recognize and then normalize biomedical ontology and
terminology entities in LitCovid.
The second type is social media data, particularly
Tweets. COVID-19 related Tweet datasets are built
for many analytic tasks such as identification of
informative Tweets (Nguyen et al., 2020b), and
disinformation detection and fact-checking (Shahi
and Nandini, 2020; Alam et al., 2020; Alsudias
and Rayson, 2020). The most relevant work to
ours is proposed by Zong et al. (2020), that aims
to extract COVID-19 events reporting test results,
death cases, cures and prevention from English
Tweets. As Twitter is rarely used by Vietnamese
people, we could not use it for data collection.

Our dataset
Entity types

We define 10 entity types with the aim of extracting key information related to COVID-19 patients,
which are especially useful in downstream applications. In general, these entity types can be used
in the context of not only the COVID-19 pandemic
but also in other future epidemics. The description
of each entity type is briefly described in Table 1.
See the Appendix for entity examples as well as
some notices over the entity types.

3.2

We first crawl articles tagged with "COVID-19"
or "COVID" keywords from the reputable Vietnamese online news sites, including VnExpress,2
ZingNews,3 BaoMoi4 and ThanhNien.5 These articles are dated between February 2020 and August
2020. We then segment the crawled news articles’
primary text content into sentences using RDRSegmenter (Nguyen et al., 2018a) from VnCoreNLP
(Vu et al., 2018).
To retrieve informative sentences about COVID19 patients, we employ BM25Plus (Trotman et al.,
2014) with search queries of common keywords
appearing in sentences that report confirmed, suspected, recovered, or death cases as well as the
travel history or location of the cases. From the top
15K sentences ranked by BM25Plus, we manually
filter out sentences that do not contain information
related to patients in Vietnam, thus resulting in a
dataset of 10027 raw sentences.
3.3

Annotation process

We develop an initial version of our annotation
guidelines and then randomly sample a pilot set of
1K sentences from the dataset of 10027 raw sentences for the first phase of annotation. Two of the
guideline developers are employed to annotate the
pilot set independently. Following Brandsen et al.
(2020), we utilize F1 score to measure the interannotator agreement between the two annotators
at the entity span level, resulting in an F1 score of
0.88. We then host a discussion session to resolve
annotation conflicts, identify complex cases, and
refine the guidelines.
In the second annotation phase, we divide the
whole dataset of 10027 sentences into 10 nonoverlapping and equal subsets. Each subset contains 100 sentences from the pilot set from the first
annotation phase. For this second phase, we employ 10 annotators who are undergraduate students
with strong linguistic abilities (here, each annotator
annotates a subset, paid 0.05 USD per sentence).
Annotation quality of each annotator is measured
by F1 calculated over the 100 sentences that already have gold annotations from the pilot set. All
annotators are asked to revise their annotations until they achieve an F1 of at least 0.92. Finally, we

revisit each annotated sentence to make further corrections if needed, resulting in a final gold dataset
of 10027 annotated sentences.
Note that when written in Vietnamese texts,
in addition to marking word boundaries, white
space is also used to separate syllables that constitute words. Therefore, the annotation process is
performed at syllable-level text for convenience.
To obtain a word-level variant of the dataset,
we apply the RDRSegmenter to perform automatic Vietnamese word segmentation, e.g. a 4syllable written text “bệnh viện Đà Nẵng” (Da
Nang hospital) is word-segmented into a 2-word
text “bệnh_việnhospital Đà_NẵngDa_Nang ”. Here, automatic Vietnamese word segmentation outputs do
not affect gold boundaries of entity mentions.
3.4

Data partitions

We randomly split the gold annotated dataset of
10027 sentences into training/validation/test sets
with a ratio of 5/2/3, ensuring comparable distributions of entity types across these three sets. Statistics of our dataset is presented in Table 2.

Experiments
Experimental setup

We formulate the COVID-19 NER task for Vietnamese as a sequence labeling problem with the
BIO tagging scheme. We conduct experiments on
our dataset using strong baselines to investigate: (i)
the influence of automatic Vietnamese word segmentation (here, input sentence can be represented
in either syllable or word level), and (ii) the usefulness of pre-trained language models. The baselines include: BiLSTM-CNN-CRF (Ma and Hovy,
2016) and the pre-trained language models XLM-R
(Conneau et al., 2020) and PhoBERT (Nguyen and

Nguyen, 2020). XLM-R is a multi-lingual variant
of RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), pre-trained on a
2.5TB multilingual dataset that contains 137GB
of syllable-level Vietnamese texts. PhoBERT is a
monolingual variant of RoBERTa, pre-trained on a
20GB word-level Vietnamese dataset.
We employ the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF implementation from AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2018).
Training BiLSTM-CNN-CRF requires input pretrained syllable- and word-level embeddings for
the syllable- and word-level settings, respectively.
Thus we employ the pre-trained Word2Vec syllable
and word embeddings for Vietnamese from Nguyen
et al. (2020a). These embeddings are fixed during
training. Optimal hyper-parameters that we gridsearched for BiLSTM-CNN-CRF are presented in
Table 3. We utilize the transformers library (Wolf
et al., 2020) to fine-tune XLM-R and PhoBERT for
the syllable- and word-level settings, respectively,
using Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a fixed
learning rate of 5.e-5 and a batch size of 32 (Liu
et al., 2019).
The baselines are trained/fine-tuned for 30
epochs. We evaluate the Micro-average F1 score after each epoch on the validation set (here, we apply
early stopping if we find no performance improvement after 5 continuous epochs). We then choose

the best model checkpoint to report the final score
on the test set. Note that each F1 score reported is
an average over 5 runs with different random seeds.
4.2

Main results

Table 4 shows the final entity-level NER results
of the baselines on the test set. In addition to the
standard Micro-average F1 score, we also report
the Macro-average F1 score.
We categorize the results under two comparable settings of using syllable-level dataset and
its automatically-segmented word-level variant for
training and evaluation. We find that the performances of word-level models are higher than
their syllable-level counterparts, showing that automatic Vietnamese word segmentation helps improve NER, e.g. BiLSTM-CNN-CRF improves
from 0.906 to 0.910 Micro-F1 and from 0.858 to
0.875 Macro-F1 .
We also find that fine-tuning the pre-trained
language models XLM-R and PhoBERT helps
produce better performances than BiLSTM-CNNCRF. Here, PhoBERT outperforms XLM-R
(Micro-F1 : 0.945 vs. 0.938; Macro-F1 : 0.931
vs. 0.911), thus reconfirming the effectiveness of
pre-trained monolingual language models on the
language-specific downstream tasks (Nguyen and
Nguyen, 2020).
4.3

Error analysis

We perform an error analysis using the best performing model PhoBERTlarge that produces 353
incorrect predictions in total on the validation set.
The first error group consists of 69/353 instances
with correct entity boundaries (i.e. exact spans) and
incorrect entity labels. It is largely due to the fact
that the model could not differentiate between LOCATION and ORGANIZATION entities. This is
not surprising because of the ambiguity between
these two entity types, in which the same entity
mention may act as either LOCATION or ORGA-

NIZATION depending on the sentence context.
Also, in terms of contact tracing, it would be more
useful to label an organization-like entity mention
as LOCATION if we can infer that a patient presented at that organization; however, such inference
requires additional world knowledge about the entity. In addition, in this error group, the model
also struggles to recognize OCCUPATION entities
correctly. Recall that OCCUPATION entity mention must represent the job of a particular person
labeled with PERSON_NAME or PATIENT_ID.
Therefore, it may cause confusion to the model for
deciding whether an occupation is linked to a determined person or not in a single sentence context.
The second error group contains 65/353 instances with inexact spans overlapped with gold
spans but having correct entity labels. These errors
generally happen with multi-word ORGANIZATION entity mentions, where (i) an ORGANIZATION entity contains a nested location inside its
span, e.g. “Bệnh viện Lao và Bệnh phổi Cần Thơ”
(Can Tho hospital for Tuberculosis and Lung disease; here, “Can Tho” is a province in Vietnam),
or (ii) an organization is a subdivision of a larger
organization, e.g. “Khoa tim mạch - Bệnh viện
Bạch Mai” (Department of Cardiology - Bach Mai
Hospital).6
The third group of 8/353 errors with overlapped
inexact spans and incorrect entity labels does not
provide us with any useful insight. The final
group of remaining 211/353 errors is accounted
for predicted entities corresponding with gold O
labels. Particularly in the case of LOCATION,
where generic mentions, such as “Bệnh viện tỉnh”
(province hospital), “Trạm y tế xã” (commune medical station), “chung cư” (apartment), are recognized as entities, while in fact, they are not.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented the first manuallyannotated Vietnamese dataset in the COVID-19
domain, focusing on the named entity recognition
task. We empirically conduct experiments on our
dataset to compare strong baselines and find that
the input representations and the pre-trained language models all have influences on this COVID19 related NER task. We hope that our dataset
can serve as the starting point for further Vietnamese NLP research and applications in fighting
the COVID-19 and other future epidemics.

Annotation examples
Example 1:
LOC
OCC
PAT

OCC
LOC
PAT
Patient " 669 " is a doctor working at Dong Nai General Hospital
Example 2:

Two nurses of Bach Mai Hospital got infected from external source and then infected each other.
Example 4:
LOC
SYM

Bệnh nhân tử vong tại
với chẩn đoán
SYM
SYM

LOC
SYM
The patient died at Da Nang Lung Hospital , diagnosed with severe pneumonia with history of
SYM
SYM
unrecoverable multiorgan dysfunction syndrome , terminal chronic kidney failure .
Here, PAT, OCC, LOC, DAT and SYM abbreviate PATIENT_ID, OCCUPATION, LOCATION, DATE
and SYMPTOM&DISEASE, respectively. Recall that an annotation PATIENT_ID over “X” refers to as
the Xth patient having COVID-19 in Vietnam (e.g. in Example 1: "669" refers to as the 669th patient).
Notices over entity types
We have two principles for selecting the ten entity types: (i) Entities should contain key information related to the COVID-19 patients (here,
the information should be helpful in the context
of contact tracing and monitoring the growth of
the pandemic); and (ii) The availability of entity
types in the text, i.e., how frequent does each of
the entity types appear. This is decided based on
manual observations of news articles.
In the context of contact tracing, it is more useful to broaden the scope of location. For example,
when a patient is presented at an organization, we
refer to that organization as a location if we can
infer its specific location on the map. In Example
1, we would label the entity mention “Bệnh viện Đa
khoa Đồng Nai” (Dong Nai General Hospital) with

LOCATION as its provide information about the
place that a patient used to be at. On the other hand,
in Example 2, the entity mention “Bệnh viện Bệnh
Nhiệt đới TP HCM” (Ho Chi Minh City Hospital
for Tropical Diseases) is labeled as ORGANIZATION because it acts as the subject executing a
specific action (i.e. reporting a test result).
For OCCUPATION, AGE and GENDER entities, we only tag them if we can link the corresponding entity mentions to a specific entity with NAME
or PATIENT_ID label within the same sentence.
In Example 1, “bác sĩ” (doctor) is the occupation
of patient “669”, thus we label this mention as an
entity of type OCCUPATION. However, in Example 3, we do not label “ điều dưỡng” (nurses) as
OCCUPATION as we cannot link this mention to
any determined person.

For SYMPTOM&DISEASE entities, we prefer
the entities to be as detailed as possible. For instance, in Example 4 we consider words denoting
the levels of severity as part of diseases, such as
“nặng” (severe), “không hồi phục” (unrecoverable),
“giai đoạn cuối” (terminal) and “mạn (chronic).
