Abstract
We conduct a unique, Amazon MTurk-based global experiment to investigate the importance of an exponentialgrowth prediction bias (EGPB) in understanding why the COVID-19 outbreak has exploded. The scientific basis
for our inquiry is the well-established fact that disease spread, especially in the initial stages, follows an exponential function meaning few positive cases can explode into a widespread pandemic if the disease is sufficiently
transmittable. We define prediction bias as the systematic error arising from faulty prediction of the number of
cases x-weeks hence when presented with y-weeks of prior, actual data on the same. Our design permits us to
identify the root of this under-prediction as an EGPB arising from the general tendency to underestimate the
speed at which exponential processes unfold. Our data reveals that the “degree of convexity” reflected in the
predicted path of the disease is significantly and substantially lower than the actual path. The bias is significantly
higher for respondents from countries at a later stage relative to those at an early stage of disease progression.
We find that individuals who exhibit EGPB are also more likely to reveal markedly reduced compliance with the
WHO-recommended safety measures, find general violations of safety protocols less alarming, and show greater
faith in their government’s actions. A simple behavioral nudge which shows prior data in terms of raw numbers,
as opposed to a graph, causally reduces EGPB. Clear communication of risk via raw numbers could increase
accuracy of risk perception, in turn facilitating compliance with suggested protective behaviors.

The COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic, adversely affecting the lives of millions of people around the
world. While not a lot is yet known about the virus and how it operates, and with no vaccine or medication in
sight, there is complete agreement on the need for people to strictly follow WHO guidelines regarding frequent
washing of hands, use of hand sanitizers and face masks, social distancing and, if needed, self-quarantine (Lunn
et al., 2020). Of course, unsurprisingly, not everyone complies with these guidelines, at least not with the seriousness with which they need to be followed (van Bavel et al., 2020; Cummins, 2020; Pinsker, 2020). This sort of
(non)compliance is an active decision predicated upon, at least, one influential variable, the accuracy with which
an individual perceives her own likelihood of getting infected (loosely, her risk perception).1 All else same, if her
risk perception is high, she is more likely to show compliance.
A large body of work in behavioral psychology and economics has documented how accuracy of risk perception may be compromised by a whole host of behavioral biases (such as, optimism, overconfidence, and so on).
This paper focuses attention on one bias: exponential-growth prediction bias (EGPB), the “pervasive tendency to
linearize exponential functions when assessing them intuitively” which leads to “a systematic tendency to underestimate a future value given a present value” (Stango and Zinman, 2009; Goda et al., 2019)2 . Why is a study
of this bias critical to our understanding of the current pandemic? Prior epidemiological studies (see Keeling
and Rohani (2011)) document how disease spread, especially in the initial stages, often follows an exponential
function. This means few positive cases can explode into a widespread pandemic if the disease is sufficiently
contagious. It also means any failure to “read the tea leaves”, arising from EGPB, can be devastating for society
and, therefore, worthy of attention. Fig. A1 plots the trajectory of reported cases for four countries, Germany,
the United States, France, and Spain. The growth trajectory is clearly exponential.3 Pinsker (2020) argues “[t]he
human brain can have trouble keeping pace with such rapid growth” and that “people tend to underestimate the
speed at which exponential processes—such as a disease outbreak—unfold.” This is our entry point. To the best
1 This point was noted in a classic article pertaining to the 1918 influenza pandemic in Science “People do not appreciate the risks they
run” (Soper, 1919).
2 Existing analysis of the exponential growth bias rely on quantifying the difficulty most people have with compound interest rates Levy
and Tasoff (2016). General difficulty with discriminating linear from non-linear processes is documented in Cordes et al. (2019) and shows
up even as early as in pre-kindergarten students (Ebersbach et al., 2010).
3 In the U.S., the number of confirmed cases was 213 on March 9; six days later, it was 1,678. Over the same period, the number of
confirmed cases in France rose from 1,116 to 4,469, and the number in Italy rose from 7,375 to 21,157—and Italy had only 1,689 cases as of
March 2.

of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt at understanding the role of the EGPB in the study of disease spread
in a pandemic and its subsequent effect on compliance behavior.
We define prediction bias as the systematic error arising from under or over -prediction of the number of
COVID-19 positive detections x-weeks hence when presented with y-weeks of prior, actual data on the same.
We call it EGPB if the actual data follows an exponential function and the predictions fail to appreciate the
extent of the true convexity. Our analysis works off the premise that those who suffer from EGPB will greatly
underestimate how quickly a disease spreads, fail to perceive their own onrushing risk, and hence, show low
compliance with safety measures.
We use data from a global survey we conducted in March of 2020 to investigate three pressing questions of
significant policy relevance:
1. How much of individual-level compliance with WHO guidelines can be explained by the bias associated
with predicting the number of COVID-19 cases, after controlling for demographic and cultural variables?
2. Does EGPB diminish as a country moves through different stages of the disease?

4

3. Does a simple nudge in terms of how data is presented help mitigate EGPB?
We ran an incentivized, data-collection survey on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, an online platform, with participation from people in 43 countries. The survey is not nationally representative, but since the samples all
came from the same source, they permit a relatively clean comparison. Participants were also asked about their
frequency of hand-washing and use of sanitizers and masks, their willingness to pay for masks, their view about
the social appropriateness of others’ behavior, their like/dislike of government responses; other demographic
information was collected as well. Using this information, we generate composite indices measuring individual
attitudes regarding their i) own compliance, ii) appropriateness of violation of WHO measures, and iii) satisfaction with the government’s performance. Taken together, this gives us a broad sense of “compliance”. The
prediction data was used to construct several measures of EGPB and featured alongside the compliance measure
as regressors in a multivariate regression model.
Our main results are as follows. First, we document the presence of EGPB as it pertains to forecasting the xweeks ahead path of the disease. Second, the “degree of convexity” reflected in the predicted path of the disease
is significantly and substantially lower than the actual path.5 This connects with the first result: the source of
the prediction bias is the “lower convexity” of the mental model used.6 Third, EGPB is significantly lower for
4 We identify three distinct stages a country can be in: Stage 1 with less than 100 positive detections, Stage 2 with between 100 and 999,
and finally, Stage 3 with 1000 or more.
5 We use the term “degree of convexity” to mean the rate of change of the gradient of the data function. In our case, this rate is higher in
the actual data function as compared to the predicted data function.
6 Pennycook et al. (2020) find that overall cognitive sophistication (the composite of four measures) was a strong negative predictor of
COVID-19 misperceptions. To the extent discriminating between linear and exponential processes is correlated with cognitive sophistication,
our results are in sync with their findings. Strikingly though, their measure of cognitive sophistication was not a strong or consistent
predictor of COVID-19 risk perceptions or behavior change intentions. Similarly, Stanley et al. (2020) find that “individuals less willing
to engage effortful, deliberative, and reflective cognitive processes were [. . . ] less likely to have recently engaged in social-distancing and
hand-washing.”

participants from countries at an early stage relative to those at a later stage of the disease. Fourth, we find
our measures of EGPB are significant predictors of compliance: higher bias is associated with lower own safety
compliance, a higher approval of violation of safety measures and a greater satisfaction with the government’s
response with respect to the pandemic.

Fifth, we find that providing disease trajectory information using y-

weeks prior data in the form of raw numbers causally reduces EGPB more than providing the same via a graph.
Like us, Levy and Tasoff (2017) find “exponential-growth bias is unlikely to be eliminated by simple “nudges”
such as a graphical intervention.
There is a small yet burgeoning literature studying the role of biases in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Our paper was written concurrently and independently of this literature. Our paper is closest in spirit to an
important contribution by Wise et al. (2020) who, like us, use an online sample (but only of U.S. households)
between March 11, the day when the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and March 16. Their primary
focus is on deciphering to what extent individuals are aware of their own risk of contracting the disease, their
risk of passing it on to others, and the extent to which protective behaviors are predicted by their perception
of risk. Our study is different in two ways. First, we do not directly elicit peoples’ perception of their own
risk, because as Wise et al. (2020) report, such elicitations may be contaminated by the simultaneous presence
of multiple cognitive biases (such as optimism or overconfidence; see also Stanley et al. (2020)).7 Second, our
measure of perception bias, EGPB, is rooted in the linear vs exponential heuristic literature with a clear theoretical
underpinning. And third, our measures of prediction bias are less likely to be “pure noise” since they are the
result of an incentivized elicitation process.
A portion of the major contribution by Fetzer et al. (2020) is also devoted to unearthing the sort of prediction
bias that is the focus of our paper. In their setup, online participants are asked to predict the number of infections
from a fictitious disease over several days under several formulaic scenarios designed to test their innate ability
to see geometric or exponential growth patterns. They find that the predictions of the median participant could
be well approximated by a linear, mental model. We depart from their work in several ways. First, our design is
not aimed at understanding whether participants can “do the math” and figure out where a hypothetical series
is headed. Second, we provide actual, COVID data on the number of reported cases (not infections, since in the
absence of 100% testing, it is impossible to know the head-count of infections; if anything, participants likely form
priors about infections based on the number of reported cases, and such priors could depend on their innate faith
in data-reporting bodies, which, by the way, we test for). Third, our results show our set of participants do not
seem to have a linear model in mind: their mental model is neither a linear extension of best fit over the entire
data range nor is it a linear extrapolation from the last shown data point.

7 That is not to say these other biases cannot play a role; it is just that for a disease like COVID, the EGPB is of first-order importance.
Also, our measures of EGPB are composite in nature. While composite, summary measures are useful to policymakers, the benefit of the
granular measures in Wise et al. (2020), capturing own risk of getting infected versus the risk of infecting others, is also high.

Experimental Design and Procedure

We show our participants data on the actual number of COVID-19 (same as in Fig. A1) from four countries majorly affected by the virus as of 21st March, 2020, namely, Germany, USA, France, and Spain. In our experiment,
participants perform four prediction tasks for two out of these four randomly chosen countries; country names
are not revealed.8 In each task, they are shown three, actual weekly data points of COVID-19 cases. Subsequently,
they are asked to predict the number of cases for Weeks 4 and 5, the actual numbers of which is known to us,
the researchers. This means, we, the researchers, have full knowledge of the true, underlying data-generating
process.
Formally, denote the actual and the predicted number of COVID-19 cases in Week i by Ni and Pi , respectively,
for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. As noted earlier, the participants observe three data points on the number of COVID-19 cases
in three consecutive weeks (N1 , N2 , N3 ) and are asked to make their predictions for Week 4 and Week 5.9 The
bias for Week 4 is defined as the difference between the actual number (N4 ) and the predicted number in Week 4
(P4 ), relative to the difference between the actual number in Week 4 (N4 ) and the actual number in Week 3 (N3 ).
In other words, the actual prediction error relative to the maximum possible error in Week 4 may be interpreted
as the Bias for Week 4 with respect to Week 3 i.e., Bias43 =
respect to Week 3 as Bias53 =

N5 -P5
N5 -N3 .

N4 -P4 10
N4 -N3 .

Similarly, we define Bias for Week 5 with

Finally, we analyze the results in terms of Biasavg , which is the average

of Bias43 and Bias53 .
Participants are paid $0.50 as a participation fee. Further, two of the four prediction tasks are randomly
picked and if the participant’s prediction is within 5% of the actual number, she is paid an additional $0.25 for
that task. Participants can earn a maximum of $1 for the entire experiment, which lasted for about 7 minutes.
Notice, from Fig. A1, that the early phases of the spread of COVID-19 is described by notably less convexity
relative to later phases. In order to understand, whether the prediction accuracy varies with respect to the phases
of the disease spread, we implement a within-subject variation in the four predictions tasks. In two consecutive
tasks, the participants are shown the data either from the early phases or from later phases of the two randomly
selected countries. Asking them to respond to early and later phases ensure that their personal experience in
their home country is mimicked in at least one of the tasks. If in the first two tasks, a participant is shown data
from two countries at early phases, in the next two they are shown the numbers from the later phases of the same
two countries. The order in which a subject sees the early phase is randomized to control for order effects.
We implement this design so that we can explore whether the nature of representation (graphical or numeric)
of the actual data helps mitigate EGPB. To that end, some participants are randomly shown the actual number
8 If a participant belongs to any of the four countries, say X, she is not be shown numbers from X; instead she is shown numbers from
two countries randomly chosen from the set W, Y and Z. This ensures her prior information about disease progression in her own country,
X, does not contaminate her prediction.
9 Since the true number of infected individuals at any point is unknown, we go by the official statistics on reported cases. Interestingly,
respondents in our sample report that their belief about true infection rate is, on average, 10% higher than the official statistics.
10 We rely on the simple deviation instead of root mean square deviation since the latter will transform each deviation into a positive
number, which in turn, will lead to overweighing the deviation.

of COVID-19 cases graphically (as is the dominant form of representation of the data in print or online media)
while others are shown the same in terms of raw numbers. We implement this through a between-subject design,
which allows us to estimate the causal effect of the nudge in mitigating the EGPB. Screen 5 of the experimental
instruction given in Appendix 4 presents an example of the two forms of data representation .
We define Stage 1 as countries as those with less than 100 positive cases, Stage 2 between 100 and 999, and
Stage 3 with 1000 or more cases, as of 21st March, 2020. Running the study on Amazon MTurk got us access
to a global pool of participants who resided in countries that were themselves at different stages of the disease.
This gives us an unique opportunity to study whether the EGPB varies with the stage of the country in which a
participant resides.
Following this, we administer a short survey to capture the participants’ own protection behavior and compliance with the WHO guidelines. The survey, along with the experimental instructions, is included in Appendix
2. Participants are asked to report their frequency of hand-washing, use of sanitizers and masks, their opinion
about the appropriateness of public gatherings and the like, their perception about the desirability and efficacy of
their own government’s responses. Basic demographic information was also collected. We categorize the questions into three broad headings, namely, Actual Realized Compliance, Appropriateness of Violation of Safety
Norms and Agreeableness with Government Performance, which taken together offers a comprehensive sense of
participants’ compliance with safety guidelines. The definitions are given in Table A1. In addition, we randomize
the order of whether a participant is shown the prediction segment first or the survey segment first in order to
mitigate experimenter demand effects.
In sum, the experimental design allows us to answer the three main research questions in this paper: 1) Do
people exhibit EGPB in the context of the COVID-19 spread? 2) Is this bias a significant predictor of lax attitude
towards COVID-19 related safety norms? 3) Can a simple nudge in the way the data is represented help mitigate
the bias?

Results

Our first set of results document existence of the aforediscussed prediction biases. Fig. 1A presents the number of
COVID-19 cases in early and later phases, for all the five weeks along with the mean, median and the interquartile
range of the predicted number of cases in Weeks 4 and 5, averaged over all the four countries. Fig. 1B presents
the same in terms of the log-transformed data11 . The mean prediction in the early phase panel of Fig. 1 exceeds
the actual number because of outliers. Except for the one case, both the median and the mean prediction lies well
below the actual number of COVID-19 cases. To avoid outlier-driven distortions, we rely on the median measure
in all subsequent analysis. The actual numbers, averaged across all four countries, are 1540 in Week 4 and 9189

in Week 4 and Week 5 are 17450 and 55934, while the median predictions are 9500 and 18000, respectively.

Figure 1: Actual and predicted number of COVID-19 cases pooled across four countries
Panel A above plots the actual number and the predictions of COVID-19 cases in the linear scale, while Panel B plots the same data in a
logarithmic scale. Both the panels use data pooled across the four countries. The predictions for early (later) phase cases are given on the
left (right). Each graph presents participants’ 25th percentile, mean, median, and 75th percentile prediction of the number of COVID-19
cases on Week 4 and Week 5.

As discussed earlier and shown in Fig. A1, the underlying data generating process of actual spread of COVID19 is convex. One interesting question is, is the prediction model used by the median individual also convex or
is it linear? To test this, we compute the ratio of the slopes of the line segment connecting N4 and N5 and
that connecting N3 and N4 (i.e., ⌘ =

slope(N4 ,N5 )
slope(N3 ,N4 ) ).

We compare ⌘ with the ratio of slopes of the line segment
7

connecting P4 and P5 and that connecting N3 and P4 (i.e., ⇢ =

slope(P4 ,P5 )
slope(N3 ,P4 ) ).

Column (3) in Table 4 reports ⌘ - ⇢.

We test Ho : ⌘ - ⇢ = 0 and show it is significantly different from zero for all the countries, for both phases (except
in one case). This indicates that the underlying prediction model used by the median individual is significantly
less convex than the actual data generating process; however, we do not find evidence that the prediction model
used is actually linear even though it is clear that the prediction model is significantly closer to the linear fit than
the exponential.12
How does the degree of convexity of the predictions vary with the stages of the disease a participant is
exposed to? We find that participants from Stage 3 countries (relative to those from Stages 1 and 2), for all our
bias measures, make predictions that are closer to the best-fit linear model while predictions of those from Stage
1 countries are closer to the actual, exponential data. This has the prima facie implication that people in advanced

Note: The figure reports the median values of different measures of biases. The error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals from a

We carry out the rest of the analysis on log transformed data with the median as the primary statistic of
analysis. In Fig. 2, we analyze whether these differences, when transformed as biases, are significantly different
from zero. MedianBias43 is positive and significantly different from zero at 0.42 (Wilcoxon signed rank test,
p - value < 0.01), meaning the median participant exhibits 42% under-prediction. Similarly, Bias53 and the
AverageBias are positive and significant at 0.46 and 0.44 (Wilcoxon signed rank tests, p - value < 0.01). Clearly,
12 We

test if the prediction model used by our participants is indeed linear by comparing the slopes of the individual linear pieces
connecting N3 , P4 , P5 with the slope of the best linear fit of N1 , N2 , N3 ( ˆ ). The nonparametric equality of median test rejects the null
that the piece wise slopes N3 , P4 and P4 , P5 are in fact equal to the slope of the linear fit. Further, we statistically compare the euclidian
distance between the median prediction and the linear fit, and the median prediction and the actual data. We find the prediction model to
be significantly closer to the linear fit. These results are not reported but are available upon request.

the participants exhibit substantial prediction bias. Interestingly, Bias43 is significantly smaller than Bias53
(nonparametric median test, p - value < 0.01), suggesting that the size of the prediction error increases with
time. While the main focus of the paper is on EGPB arising from the incentivized prediction, we also elicit
participants’ belief about the number of COVID-19 cases on the day of the experiment in their own country and
their prediction about the same seven days hence. As Fig. 2 indicates participants’ (non-incentivized) prediction
about the number of cases in their own country, seven days hence, reveals a 49% under-prediction.
Our Amazon-MTurk participant pool comprised of people from 43 countries, each country being at different
stages of COVID-19 spread at the point in time when the data was collected. This gives us an unique opportunity
to examine how EGPB compare for people from countries at different stages of the disease. Fig. 3 compares the
biases across Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 and plots the regression coefficient of Stage 2 dummy in Fig. 3(i) and (ii).
While the incentivized bias measures are not different between Stage 2 and Stage 1, the OwnBias is significantly
higher in Stage 2 than in Stage 1 (p - value = 0.02). Fig. 3(iii) and (iv) shows that Bias43 , Bias53 ,AverageBias
and OwnBias are significantly higher in Stage 3 than in Stage 1 (p - value < 0.5 for all the variables). The pattern
is less clear when Stage 3 is compared with Stage 2 as Fig. 3(v) and (vi) reveals. In all, the data suggests, biases,
as per our different measures, are significantly higher for countries at Stage 3 than those in Stage 1 or 2.13 Table
4 reports estimates and the standard errors.

13 Relatedly, participants from Stage 3 countries use a prediction model that is closer to the best fit linear model than the true exponential
data generating process, relative to those from Stages 1 and 2. The results not reported but are available upon request.

Figure 3: Variation of prediction bias between countries at different stages of COVID-19 spread
This figure plots the differences in the median EGPB across countries in Stages 1, 2 and 3 of COVID-19 spread for each of the four
measures of bias. Model 1 (Model 2) shows the pairwise differences in EGPB between the three stages estimated from a median

regression without (with) controls. The control variables include age, gender, health condition, education level, income, treatment and log
of reported COVID-19 cases as on 21st March (fixed for each country). The specification in Model 2 for OwnBias in (iv), additionally
controls for an individual’s information bias. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Having established a significant EGPB, we ask, is it a significant predictor of compliance with safety measures. To examine this, we regress different indices of compliance on our EGPB measures, where the indices are
computed from answers to a menu of questions asked of the participants14 . We categorize the questions into
three indices: Actual Realized Compliance, Appropriateness of Violation of Safety Norms and Agreeableness
with Government Performance. The indices are constructed by taking the first principal component of the relevant set of variables. Table A1 lays out the summary statistics of the compliance indices. Each column of Fig.
4 corresponds to each of the above indices and plots the estimated regression coefficient for each definition of
prediction bias. Model 1 and 2 run the regression without control variables and with control variables, respectively. As the figure illustrates and Table 4 confirms, EGPB is a negative predictor of Actual Realized Compliance,
indicating higher the bias, lower is the self-reported measure of compliance of safety norms. A higher EGPB also
predicts a higher Appropriateness of Violation of Safety Norms as the plotted coefficients in the second column
of Fig. 4 reveals. This means, an individual who shows EGPB is also likely to view violations of safety norms

such as the avoidance of public gatherings, working from home, etc. as not very alarming. Finally, EGPB is
also a significant predictor of Agreeableness with Government Performance, implying, higher bias is associated
with greater satisfaction with the performance of the government with regard to the measures taken vis-a-vis
COVID-19.

Figure 4: EGPB and COVID-19 compliance
This figure plots the coefficients estimated from OLS regressions between EGPB and compliance, measured via three indices: Actual
realized compliance, Appropriateness of violation of safety norms and Agreeableness with government performance. Model 1 (Model 2)
shows the estimates from specification without (with) controls. The control variables include age, gender, health condition, education
level, income, perceived effectiveness of the safety measures, treatment and log of reported COVID-19 cases as on 21st March (fixed for
each country). The specification in Model 2 for OwnBias in (iv), additionally controls for an individual’s information bias. # p=0.11, *p
< 0.10, **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.01.

Our analysis thus far suggests that people predict using a model which is substantially less convex than the
true data generating process. This generates significant prediction bias which, in turn, is significantly associated
with non-compliance of safety measures. Given this link, we ask: would a simple perceptual nudge help ameliorate the prediction bias? To that end, we use a randomized experiment design in which some participants are
randomly shown N1 , N2 , N3 , in terms of raw numbers, while others are shown the same in graphical form.

Figure 5: Prediction bias across treatments
Participants are randomized into graphical and numerical treatments, where they are shown the data from Weeks 1, 2 and 3 in the form of
raw numbers and graphs, respectively. The figure plots the median prediction biases for the graphical and the numerical treatments. The
error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals from a Kendall’s Tau test for the hypothesis that the median is zero. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, ***
p<0.01.

The median biases across graphical and numerical treatments are presented in Figure 5. Presentation of the
past data in numerical form significantly decreases the bias, however defined, relative to the graphical treatment.
The treatment effects from ordinary least square regressions are reported in Table 4. This result holds with
and without a set of controls. In fact, the treatment effect is negative and significant at the 1% level when the
regression controls for a set of demographic variables. The regressions when run separately for the early and
later phases reveal the same pattern. We do not find any heterogeneity in the additional robustness checks we
run to see if the treatment effect varies with education levels and age15 .

15 The results related to heterogeneity with respect to age, education levels and phases are not reported in the paper, but are available on
request.

Conclusion

This paper uses data from a global survey to ask if perception errors relating to the tendency of people to linearize
essentially exponential disease progression is key to understanding their compliance with widely recommended
safety precautions. Our principal findings are a) there is evidence of rampant prediction biases; b) the mental
model used to make predictions is not linear but substantially less convex than the actual; c) higher prediction
bias is a significant predictor of lower safety compliance, less disagreement with violations of safety measures,
and a greater satisfaction with the government’s response with respect to the pandemic. Numerical representation of the disease trajectory can causally reduce prediction bias as opposed to graphical representation of the
same. This last point suggests that raw numbers continue to make quite an impact on people’s risk perception
and should, at the very least, be presented alongside the common “flatten the curve” style graphics.
A few caveats are in order. First, there are well-understood problems (representativeness and external validity)
of conducting global surveys on Amazon’s MTurk that are germane to our survey. In our defense, though, these
problems are also present in any of the online surveys that researchers are forced to use while the pandemic
rages on. One key difference with existing work is our use of incentivized prediction elicitation. Another is
that unlike existing computations of prediction bias Fetzer et al. (2020) using fictitious information, we show
actual data from COVID infections and detect prediction bias, not just a mathematical inability to compute
exponential progression.16 Also, the timing of our survey was crucial: we wanted to know if the prediction
biases changed in real time as a country moved from under a hundred infections to over a thousand infections.
By now, most countries have moved on to Stage 3 but our data on biases in earlier stages may be useful for overall
understanding of future epidemics.
Our work was primarily designed to detect prediction biases and to see if such biases were significant predictors of self-protection behavior. We are, however, unable to make definitive causal statements connecting
prediction bias with compliance. Nor are we able to offer causal mechanisms to explain our findings. In particular, it is a bit perplexing why participants from countries at a later stage of the disease show larger prediction
biases and less “convexity”. One can speculate this has something to do with hope or optimism or widespread
messaging related to “the end is near”. We are able to causally show that messaging with raw data is more
helpful in reducing the prediction bias than graphical data. Future work should take these exercises up.

16 In Fetzer et al. (2020), “participants were instructed to assume that on day 1, one person has the fictitious disease. Furthermore, they
were told to assume that each day a newly infected person infects two healthy people and then stops being contagious. Participants were
further told that on day 2, 3 people will be infected by the disease as the person who had the disease on day 1 spread it to two other people
on day 2. Participants were then asked to predict the count of total people infected with the fictitious disease on day 5, 10, and 20.”

Figure A2: Country wise prediction bias in logarithmic scale

The figure plots the five actual number of COVID-19 cases, mean, median and interquartile range of the predictions, on the logarithmic
scale. Participants observe the actual data in Week 1, 2 and 3 and predict the number of cases in Week 4 and 5. The line connecting the
actual number of cases give the growth path of the disease. The panels on the left (right) plot the above for the early (later) phases of the
disease transmission. In all the cases above, except USA in the early phase, the mean and median are significantly less than the actual
number. The mental model used by the participants is significantly less convex than the actual data, as is clear from the growth path of the
median of predicted number of cases.

† Note: In Panel A, prediction biases of participants from countries in Stage 2 and 3 are compared with

those from Stage 1 countries. Stage 3 dummy is consistently positive and significant indicating the bias is
significantly higher in Stage 3 countries than Stage 1 countries. Panel B compares the same between Stage
3 and Stage 2 countries. The biases are significantly higher in Stage 3 relative to Stage 2 for a number of
specifications. Control variables for the incentivized biases include age, gender, health condition, education

Experimental Instructions
Screen 1
Informed Consent Form

You are being invited to participate in this study conducted Joydeep Bhattacharya (Iowa State University, USA). Your
consent is specifically sought on the last page of this form.
Title of Study

Behavioral Responses to COVID-19
Purpose

The purpose of this research is to study human responses and coping strategies related to the spread of the Coronavirus.
The survey is designed to generate valuable information about your own behavior and perceptions. Besides, it will
collect some basic demographic information. Our purpose to collect aggregated information about human responses
so we can better understand average behavior in a population.
Procedure

In the first part of the study, you will be given some data and asked to make predictions about the future. Following
this, you will be asked to answer a short questionnaire on your behavior and perceptions and of those around you
related to the spread of coronavirus. We expect you to take no more than 5-6 minutes to complete the entire survey.
Risks

There are minimal risks of participation in the study. The choices you make will be recorded using a code number,
with no link to your identity and no one will get to know what you have chosen. The data will be completely

Thank you for agreeing to participate in our study. The study consists of four prediction tasks (Task 1, Task 2, Task
3 and Task 4) explained in detail below and a short demographic survey. You will receive a fixed amount of 50 cents
for completing the entire HIT today. In addition, two of the four tasks you complete will be randomly picked and
your earnings on these two tasks, if any, will be paid to you. Click next to proceed to the first task.
Screen 4
Task 1

In this part, we will ask you to predict the number of Coronavirus cases that are likely to be recorded in the near future
for a certain country.
A certain country, W, has recorded a certain number of Coronavirus cases in each of three successive weeks -- call
them Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3. We will show you these numbers and your task will be to predict the number
of cases you think will be recorded in this country in Weeks 4 and 5. We, the researchers, already know the true
number of cases in Weeks 4 and 5 in this country. We want to see how close your predictions are to those true values.
Please note: The numbers you will see are actual numbers for a real but unnamed country.
You are asked to make two predictions, one each for Weeks 4 and 5. We will randomly select one of your predictions.
If your prediction turns out to be within 5% of the actual number of cases and if your response is recorded (if
you click next) within 60 seconds of starting the task, you will receive a bonus of 25 cents for this task.
