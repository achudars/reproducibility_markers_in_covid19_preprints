Continuum models of epidemics do not take into account the underlying microscopic network
structure of social connections. This drawback becomes extreme during quarantine when most
people dramatically decrease their number of social interactions, while others (like cashiers in grocery stores) continue maintaining hundreds of contacts per day. We formulate a two-level model
of quarantine. On a microscopic level, we model a single neighborhood assuming a star-network
structure. On a mesoscopic level, the neighborhoods are placed on a two-dimensional lattice with
nearest neighbors interactions. The modeling results are compared with the COVID-19 data for
several counties in Michigan (USA) and the phase diagram of parameters is identified.

INTRODUCTION

Reaction diffusion dynamics on a lattice is an active
topic of current research [1]. The intrinsic stochasticity
significantly affects various macroscopic phenomena such
as front propagation [2] or phase transitions [3] and leads
to completely new effects such as extinction in metapopulation models [4]. One particularly interesting area of
research deals with reaction diffusion dynamics on networks [5].
The topic of the spread of epidemics on networks has
received substantial attention in recent years [6]. These
network models eliminate the two main drawbacks [7] of
the standard SIR and SEIR models [8] of the spread of
an epidemic. The first drawback is related to the rate of
recovery of an infected individual. The modeling implies
a Poisson process, which means an exponential distribution of individual disease duration. This is in contrast
to observations showing that the distribution is peaked
around an average disease duration. The second drawback is the assumption of an equal number of contacts for
each individual, i.e. ignoring the underlying microscopic
structure of the social network [7].
Different individuals have a different average number
of contacts, depending not only on their social behavior,
but on their work. The inhomogeneity in the number of
contacts becomes especially well-pronounced during the
time of quarantine, when the majority of people work
from home, but some individuals (like cashiers in a grocery store) still maintain hundreds of contacts per day.
Typically, metapopulation models assume that the local
neighborhoods are well mixed; then to model the entire
population, these neighborhoods are placed on a lattice
or form a network. The disease dynamics on such a network can be investigated by taking into account various
migration patterns of individuals between the neighborhoods [9]. The present work formulates a basic model of
disease dynamics during the quarantine, testing the other
extreme, where each single neighborhood is far from being well-mixed and is modeled by a star-like network,
while a larger region is modeled as a lattice of these neighborhoods.

II.

THE MODEL

The model consists of two levels. The microscopic
modeling describes a single neighborhood assuming a star
network [10], a structure, where every node (a household)
is connected to the central hub (a grocery store). The
neighborhood consists of a large number of households
(denoted by N ) not connected to each other and not
interacting with each other (mimicking the quarantine).
A representative from each household visits the grocery
store twice a week and interacts with a cashier. If the
store visitor is ill, the cashier can be infected with probability β or vice-versa: if the cashier is ill, the store visitor
can be infected with probability β (this is the first important parameter of the model). Different stages of the
disease are considered. Apart from susceptible individuals (healthy individuals who can catch the disease), there
are exposed individuals who are infected but cannot infect others (this period lasts approximately 5 days [11]).
The next step in the disease progression is being infected
without symptoms; it is assumed that this period lasts
3 days and during this time the infected individual can
infect others. Then a person might develop symptoms,
in which case they stay at home (this period lasts about
15 days). Finally, an infected individual can recover or
die. The overall considered duration of the disease for a
single individual is in agreement with the literature [12].
The main idea of the star network is the importance of
the central node: the cashier. Once a cashier gets the infection and shows symptoms, they are replaced by a new
cashier. During the time the cashier is already infected
and still working, they can infect many customers, leading to an outbreak of the disease in the neighborhood.
Monte-Carlo simulations show that in the majority of
cases, the infected customers eventually infect the new
cashier, continuing the outbreak. Prescribing a certain
mortality rate (the second important parameter of the
model), one can compute the average number of deaths
in a single neighborhood as a function of time since the
start of the epidemic.
The duration of the outbreak in a single neighborhood (denoted by τ ) increases with β, but it is sub-

2
stantially shorter than the duration of the epidemic in
a large county, containing hundreds of neighborhoods.
To compute τ , we performed 10000 simulations of a single neighborhood, in which we produced an outbreak
in a neighborhood by starting with an infected cashier.
Each particular realization has its own number of infected cashiers, which translates to the duration of the
outbreak: once the new cashier is not infected, the epidemic dies out in a star network. The chance that a large
number of cashiers are infected one after another is exponentially small, so averaging over many simulations gives
an exponential decrease in the number of exposed individuals in a neighborhood. This time dependence of the
average number of exposed individuals was measured in
simulations, and we performed an exponential fit in the
form A exp(−t/τ ). Figure 1 shows these measurements
and the resulting characteristic duration of the outbreak
τ as a function of β for two values of N (1000 households
and 700 households in a neighborhood).

FIG. 1: The number of exposed individuals in a single neighborhood as a function of time for β = 0.05. The exponential
fit (red dashed curve) provides the characteristic duration of
the outbreak τ . The inset shows this τ as a function of β for
two values of the number of households in a neighborhood:
N = 1000 (the dashed line with circles) and N = 700 (the
dotted line with x symbols).

As expected, the outbreak in a single neighborhood
lasts longer for higher values of β and for larger number
of households N : for the higher β, it is easier to infect a new cashier, prolonging the outbreak. Notice that
the characteristic duration of the outbreak in a neighborhood, τ , is not the same as the individual illness time.
This duration time τ (or the rate of recovery of a neighborhood, 1/τ ) is used in the next level of modeling: many
neighborhoods on a lattice, see Figure 2 for the schematic
representation of the system.
When on a lattice, each neighborhood can be in one
of three states: susceptible, infected or recovered. Initially, all of the neighborhoods are susceptible, but since
some households are already infected, there is a certain
initial rate of “self-infection” of a susceptible neighborhood. The neighboring lattice sites are weakly interacting. There are no interactions between the usual people
(the leaf nodes) from different neighborhoods. Instead,

we assume that a representative from each household
from one neighborhood visits grocery stores in the neighboring neighborhood, but these visits (once per month
to each of the four neighboring grocery stores) are significantly less frequent than the visits to their own grocery
store (twice per week). Still, a susceptible neighborhood
can catch the infection from a neighboring infected neighborhood. All of the relevant rates are measured in the
“microscopic” single neighborhood simulations. Then we
performed Monte-Carlo simulations of neighborhoods on
a lattice and, measuring the times at which various neighborhoods got infected, we computed the overall death
toll in the county and the number of cases as a function
of time. The consensus in the community is that the
official total number of cases is substantially underestimated, since only a fraction of infected people is tested,
so instead of relying on the reported number of cases, we
compared our results with the Michigan death toll data.
Figure 3 shows this comparison for Oakland County, the
second largest county in Michigan with a population of
over 1.2 million people. One can see that a perfect agreement is achieved for two different sets of parameters: low
β (less infectious) with high mortality and high β (more
infectious) with low mortality.
This degeneracy implies that there is a curve on the
phase plane of parameters (β-mortality), such that each
point on this curve describes the current death toll data
(as of April 20, 2020) well. We computed this curve not
only for Oakland county but also for two other counties in Michigan: Macomb county (with total population
of above 850 thousand) and Genesee county (with total
population above of 400 thousand), see Figure 4. We
have also checked the effect of the size of neighborhoods.
The total population of Oakland county is known and
fixed in the modeling. Therefore, the size of the neighborhood fully determines the lattice size. This is exactly
what Figure 4 shows for Oakland county: smaller neigh-

FIG. 3: Death toll as a function of time in Oakland county,
Michigan (USA). The initial time is March 1, 2020. In each
panel, circles represent the official data [13], and solid curves
show the results of simulations of neighborhoods on a lattice
(10 such simulations are shown in each panel to demonstrate
the effect of stochasticity). The upper panel corresponds to
β = 0.04 and mortality of 1.15 percent, while the lower panel
corresponds to β = 0.07 and mortality of 0.3 percent. Both
panels show an excellent agreement with the data. Assuming
N = 1000 households in a neighborhood with an average of 3
persons in a household, Oakland county was simulated on a
20x20 lattice, a total of 400 neighborhoods.

borhoods on a larger lattice (solid line, pluses) and larger
neighborhoods on a smaller lattice (dashed line, circles).
All the parameters in the figure fit the data very accurately, so there is a (small) uncertainty in determining
the mortality even for a fixed value of β; the uncertainty
is related to the fact that there can be smaller and bigger
neighborhoods. The reason for this effect is that for the
same β, larger neighborhoods have stronger outbreaks.
Therefore, a smaller mortality parameter is required to
obtain the observed death toll.
The main question now is how one can constrain the
parameter space. Which set of parameters (β, mortality) is more reasonable? First, one would like to describe
these counties with similar values of β and mortality
rates. Therefore, the top left corner of the phase space is
not a good region to try since the curves move apart. An-

FIG. 4: Phase diagram of parameters for three counties in
Michigan (USA). Each point of the curve corresponds to a set
of parameters that perfectly describes the current death toll
data for the respective county. Assuming N = 1000, Oakland
county (dashed line, circles) was simulated on a 20x20 lattice,
Macomb county (dotted line, squares) was simulated on a
17x17 lattice, and Genesee county (dotted line, diamonds)
was simulated on a 12x12 lattice. For comparison, we also
show simulations of Oakland county for N = 700 and 24x24
lattice (solid line, pluses).

other reason for not choosing parameters in the top left
region of the diagram is that for low contagiousness (low
β) and high mortality, the epidemic is almost over, and
unfortunately, we are not there yet. The low right region
of the phase space is not a good candidate either. For a
highly contagious disease (high β), a substantial fraction
of the population is already infected. For example, simulations show that for β = 0.07, more than one third of
the total number of households in Oakland county would
already be infected (as of April 24, 2020). This number
is too high as can be seen from the testing data: less than
20 − 25 percent of tests in Michigan are positive. Since
this data is for people who are tested (people from a high
risk group with some symptoms), this is clearly an upper
bound for the fraction of currently infected individuals.
As a result, the reasonable region of the phase diagram
is in the middle, for example, with β ≃ 0.05.
Choosing parameters from this (middle) region of the
phase diagram, one can compute the fraction of susceptible households as a function of time, see the solid curve
in Figure 5. If the quarantine is not lifted, approximately
three quarters of the population will not catch the disease. The dotted line, however, shows the fraction of
susceptible cashiers: most of them get infected during
the epidemic. The observation that nodes with high degree (in our case, the cashiers) are much more likely to
be infected is known in the literature as the “20/80 rule”
[14]. The inset shows the fraction of infected households,

one can see that the peak was reached in the middle of
April.

In the revised version of the paper, we were able to
compare the results of our simulations with the death
toll data until June 15, 2020. Since gatherings of up to
10 people in the state of Michigan were allowed starting
from May 21 and the “stay at home order” was lifted on
June 1, the death toll data for a later period cannot be
described by the current quarantine model with star-like
networks for individual neighborhoods. As predicted by
the model (see Figure 3), the death toll curve saturates.
Figure 6 shows a nice agreement with the data; using the
standard least square method, the best fit was obtained
for β = 0.039 and a mortality of 1.29 percent, which corresponds to the left region in the phase diagram (Figure
4). Figure 6 also shows that approximately 10.3 percent
of the population in Oakland county caught the disease,
which is about 123600 individuals. The reported number of cases is much lower: the official number of cases
reported by June 15 was 8564 (and another 2749 cases
are in question) [13]. Therefore, the official data underestimates the number of cases by a factor of 11 to 14.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

This work focuses on modeling disease dynamics during the quarantine, when most people dramatically decrease their number of contacts, but some individuals
still maintain hundreds of contacts per day. On a microscopic level, this pattern is modeled by a star network, where the central node (say, a cashier in a neighborhood) is connected to all other nodes, but all other
connections are prohibited. A big county is modeled as
many such neighborhoods on a lattice, Figure 2. Simulations show that the results do not strongly depend on

(Michigan): official data (black squares) and simulations of
the model (blue solid line). This figure takes into account the
official Michigan death toll data up to June 15. The inset

the number of households N in a single neighborhood if
changing N is compensated by adjusting the number of
neighborhoods on a lattice to keep the county population constant. However, the results strongly depend on
the two main parameters: the transmission coefficient β
and the mortality. Stochastic simulations of this twolevel model show a sloppy behavior [15]: different sets of
these parameters can describe the same death toll data
in a county. We were able to identify the region in the
phase plane of parameters that reproduces the observations in different counties and estimate the mortality and
the infection probability. Analyzing the later data, we
obtained the mortality in Oakland county to be around
1.3 percent, which also suggests that the real number of
coronavirus cases in this county is 11 − 14 times larger
than the number of reported cases. This number is 5
times lower than in a recent controversial study in Santa
Clara County [16], but is still very high. In some places,
where the outbreak is (was) particularly severe (for example, certain parts of Italy), the official death toll might
be underreported [17]. The situation in Michigan hospitals is substantially better, so it was assumed that the
Michigan death toll data is accurate.
The presented model is phenomenological and aims at
capturing basic features of a quarantine and avoiding the
drawbacks of continuum modeling. It can be easily modified to include more details: other essential workers with
a large number of connections (for example, health care
workers and more cashiers in the same grocery store) and
population structure in a county. Yet, phenomenological models are useful for our basic understanding of the
underlying physical mechanisms and can produce good

5
predictions. Figure 5 shows that the fraction of infected
cashiers is very large, justifying the assumption that a recovered neighborhood during the quarantine can not be
infected again. However, when the quarantine is lifted,
more high-degree nodes (people with many contacts per
day, for example, university teachers of general physics
classes) will return to work, a substantial fraction of
whom are still susceptible. This is likely to lead to the
second wave of the disease outbreak.
In order to perform simulations of neighborhoods on a
lattice, one needs to use a microscopic model of a neighborhood to compute the recovery rate. This idea of twolevel modeling, when the rates are measured in a micro-

scopic model and then used in on a macroscopic level, has
recently been employed in a completely different problem
of rare cell clustering on a substrate [18].
