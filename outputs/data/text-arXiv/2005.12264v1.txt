Abstract
The impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on health has been widely concerned. Disease risk assessment, prediction, and early warning have become
a significant research field. Previous research suggests that there is a relationship between air quality and the disease. This paper investigated the
impact of the atmospheric environment on the basic reproduction number
(R0 ) in Australia, South Korea, and Italy by using atmospheric environment data, confirmed case data, and the distributed lag non-linear model
(DLNM) model based on Quasi-Poisson regression. The results show that
the air temperature and humidity have lag and persistence on short-term
R0 , and seasonal factors have an apparent decorating effect on R0 . PM10
is the primary pollutant that affects the excess morbidity rate. Moreover,
O3 , PM2.5 , and SO2 as perturbation factors have an apparent cumulative
effect. These results present beneficial knowledge for correlation between
environment and COVID-19, which guiding prospective analyses of disease
data.

1. Introduction
At the end of 2019, the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemics caused global panic. COVID-19 epidemic has spread throughout the
world due to the long incubation period and highly infectious. By the end
of April 17th, 2020, there were a total of 2034802 confirmed cases, 135163
confirmed deaths, and 213 counties, areas, or territories with cases [23]. Until reliable vaccines become available, public health responses to COVID-19
are focused on hand hygiene, social distancing, and quarantine strategies
to reduce community transmission rates. Based on the report [22] issued
by the World Health Organization (WHO), the main transmission channels
of COVID-19 are droplet transmission and close contact transmission, and
aerosol transmission. The general spread of influenza viruses primarily occurs
through respiratory droplets between persons within 1 meter. Transmission
might therefore be reduced in the warmer and more humid weather when
droplets fall to the ground more easily. Similarly, a 15% increase in air pollutants such as PM2.5 , PM10 , SO2 , CO, NO2 , and O3 can increase the risk
2

of influenza by approximately 1.0% [21]. On May 1st, 2020, Bharat Pankhania, an infectious disease expert at the University of Exeter, UK, said that
the vital factor determining epidemic transmission is the environment [4].
While the epidemic situation outbreak began in the northern hemisphere,
some countries in the southern hemisphere are entering winter due to seasonal changes between northern and southern hemispheres, such as Australia.
Furthermore, most of the epidemic regions are located in cities with severe air
pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the relationship between
COVID-19 and atmospheric environment.
The traditional approaches to analyze the impact of the atmospheric environment on disease, including Time-Series Analysis and Case Cross-Analysis,
in which time series analysis can divide into simple Poisson regression, traditional generalized linear model (GLM), and the generalized additive model
(GAM). A significant analysis and discussion on the exposure toxicants were
presented by Gordon and Leon [10], which attempts to review the environmental heat stress challenge, and how they affect the thermoregulation
and related pathophysiological responses to environmental toxicants by timeSeries Analysis model. Peng et al. [19] conducted a Bayesian semiparametric
hierarchical model that estimates the time-varying effect of air pollution on
daily mortality. To further investigate particulate pollutants’ impact on cardiovascular disease, Leon [16] employed the classical time series analysis approach to modeling. Kleinman et al. [15] applying generalized linear mixed
models implement a general approach to evaluating whether observed counts
in relatively small areas are larger than would be expected based on a history
of naturally occurring disease. Brook et al. [5] studied the structural behavior
of PM2.5 exposure impact on cardiovascular incidence rate was carried out by
Generalized Additive Models. To quantify the effect of stimulus in the presence of covariate data, Zanobetti [24] integrated generalized additive model
and distributed lag model and proposed generalized additive distributed lag
models (DLNM). Armstrong [3] introduced the DLNM model into the study
of temperature health effects and simulated a series of relationships between
multi lag nonlinear temperature and mortality. Gasparrini et al. [9] further
develop on the DLNM model, which described the theory of distributed lag
nonlinear model using the cross-basis. The basic reproduction number R0
describes the mean number of infections generated during the infectious period of a single infective when there is no immunity from past exposures of
vaccination [11]. The COVID-19 case occurred in Australia as early as January 26. However, it was not until the end of March that Australia imposed
3

strict control policies. Given that infected and confirmed cases are one to
two weeks leading of time, there is a significant reduction in new cases in
early April before these policy interventions take effect. Instead, they indicated the environment that existed before policy measures were offered [1],
which tends to suggest that Australia had a pre-shutdown R0 well below that
seen in most other parts of the world. Australia seems to have a relatively
strong natural defense against the virus, but accounting for these different
relationships is challenging.
In this paper, we apply the DLNM model for estimating seasonal and
air pollution patterns effects on R0 in multisite time-series studies and estimating time-varying COVID-19 effects within each city and for comparing
temporal patterns across cities and geographic regions. Using data from
the CSSEGISandData [14] case data, weather city data from the Air Quality Open Data Platform [2], we estimate the effects of particulate matter
14ug/m3 in aerodynamic diameter (PM10 ) on daily R0 . The seasonal patterns are estimated for ten cities and on average for Australia, South Korea,
and Italy. We explore the sensitivity of estimated seasonal, air pollutants,
and exposure lag (in days) patterns for short-term R0 trends.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Database description
Eligible atmospheric environment data that matched the selection criteria
were collected by Air Quality Open Data Platform, which includes daily
time series on weather and air pollution assembled from publicly available
sources for the significant largest cities in the global countries. The most
recent data are available on the website (https://aqicn.org/data-platform).
Data on confirmed cases and deaths for the experiment phase of the project
sourced from publicly available sources including the John Hopkins GitHub
COVID-19 repository [7], which includes comprehensive data for confirmed
cases and deaths at the State level and data are available at the website of
the COVID-19 time-series data [13] (https://blog.stata.com).
2.2. Statistical methods
The data were normalized using confirmed case data of some cities with
severe epidemics situation in Australia(Autumn season), South Korea(Spring
4

season), and Italy(Spring season). R0 was estimated using R language package EpiEstim [6] in a Quasi-Poisson distribution. Time series analysis is
often adopted to quantitatively evaluate the short-term correlation between
environmental factors such as temperature, air pollution, and health indicators. Independent variables fitting were carried out on the air pollutants
(PM2.5 , PM10 , SO2 , CO, NO2 , and O3 ) and daily median air temperature
and humidity for the DLNM model. Estimating that the daily confirmed
incidence of the population is a small probability event, and there may be
over discretization phenomenon, uses Quasi-Poisson regression as the connection function of the model. More specifically, to assess the possibility
of seasonality and air pollutants’ impact on COVID-19, the participants include Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Seoul, Gwangju, Gyeonggi-do, Trieste
(only used in humidity), Brescia, Milan, Rome. Consequently, the hierarchy
analysis approach was adopted, where air pollutants and seasonality data are
incorporated into the DLNM model.
We carried out this study in DLNM model and also assumed that the
effects of PM10 , PM2.5 , and SO2 are linear with R0 (fun = ”lin”) and the
effects of O3 , CO, and NO2 are null up to their respective minimum ranges
and linear with R0 and applying three low thresholds parameterization (fun
= ”thr”). The argvar list is applied to generate the matrix for the space of
the predictor while modeling the relationship with temperature and humidity
through a natural cubic spline with three degrees of freedom (fun = ”ns”,
chosen by default). Conceptually, the modified DLNM model is shown as
Equation (1), (2), and (3):
log[E(Yt )] = α+cb(M edianT empt , lag, argvar = (”ns”, df = 3), arglag =
(”ns”, knots = logknots(lag, 1)))+cb(M edianHumit , lag, argvar = (”ns”, df =
3), arglag = (”ns”, knots = lgoknots(lag, 1))) (1)
where Yt represents the value of R0 on the day of t; α represents the
intercept; cb represents the cross basis; lag represents the most prolonged
lag period; Tempt represents the daily median temperature on day t and
Humit represents the daily median humidity on day t. The knots for the
spline of lags are placed at equally-spaced values in the log scale of lags,
using the function logknots.
log[E(Yt )] = α + cb(M edianAPt , lag, argvar = (”lin”)) (2)
where APt represents the concentration of pollutants on the day of t. To
PM10 , PM2.5 and SO2 , they are incorporated into the model depending on the
linear effect. The argvar list in which the function generates a basis matrix,
including a linear un-transformed variable and applying one parameter for
5

each lag up to 7 days.
log[E(Yt )] = α + cb(M edianAPt , lag, argvar = (”thr”)) (3)
Supposing O3 , CO, and NO2 were depending on the bilinear threshold
effect, which applied one parameter for each lag up to 7 days.
In this investigation there are several sources for limitation. The main
limitation is the lack of pollutant data in Trieste. Another major source of
uncertainty is in the method used to estimate lag. Due to the calculable
R0 sequence is short, we can not accurately estimate lag values. All of the
above models were fitted using the Nonlinear effect of distribution lag, as
implemented in the R statistical software package.
3. Results
The first set of analyses examined the trend of R0 in 10 cities. South
Korea, Italy, and Australia have issued strict control measures on February
27th, March 21st, and March 31st, 2020, to control the spread of infection.
Due to the characteristic of [11], we adopted February 27th, March 21st, and
March 31st as the expiry dates while calculating R0 of three countries. From
January 31st to February 27th, 2020, 56 confirmed cases were reported in
Seoul, 62 in Gyeonggi-do, and 9 in Gwangju. From March 4th to 21st, 2020,
there were 4672 confirmed cases in Milan, 5028 in Brescia, 893 in Rome, and
270 in Trieste. From March 1st to March 31st, 2020, 2032 confirmed cases
were reported in Sydney, 917 in Melbourne, and 743 in Brisbane. To estimate
R0 , repeated-measures EpiEstim [6] were used. Figure 1, 2, and 3 shows an
overview of R0 in ten cities.
Air pollutant index levels are known to vary considerably across industrial development. Table 1 shows the average air index of nine cities in
Australia, South Korea, and Italy. It is apparent from this table that air
pollutant indexes in each city in Italy (except CO) and South Korea towards
a significantly higher than those in Australia.
The significant correlation differences between Australia, South Korea,
and Italy are highlighted in Figure 4 and Figure A.1-A.8. To perspective
three cities in Australia, the temperature has a significant positive correlation with PM10 and PM2.5 , humidity has a significant negative correlation
with PM10 , and PM10 has a significant positive correlation with PM2.5 , and
SO2 , O3 , CO, NO2 do not correlate. There was a significant positive correlation between PM10 and PM2.5 in two Italian cities, but no correlation

6

among other air indexes. From three cities of data in South Korea, the temperature has a significant positive correlation with CO and NO2 , PM10 has a
significant positive correlation with PM2.5 , SO2 , CO, and NO2 , PM2.5 has a
significant positive correlation with SO2 , CO, and NO2 , SO2 has a significant
positive correlation with NO2 , CO has a significant positive correlation with
NO2 , and a significant negative correlation with O3 , NO2 has a significant
negative correlation with O3 . It is apparent from this table that PM10 and
PM2.5 in Australia and Italy cities are a significantly positive correlation, in
which except for Milan, the temperature has a significant positive correlation
with PM10 and PM2.5 . The most surprising aspect of the data is in the six
pollutants in Seoul, where any two pollutants have a significant correlation.
In the seasonal analysis, to analyze the impact of temperature and humidity on R0 , we chose Brisbane (maximum temperature), Gyeonggi-do (minimum temperature), Gyeonggi-do (maximum humidity), Trieste (minimum
humidity) and adopted relative risk (RR) as the evaluation criteria. Figure
5 is quite revealing in several ways. First, the distribution of relative risk
(RR) varies with temperature and humidity. Secondly, 27.6◦ C and 8.5◦ C
are the optimum temperature (lowest RR) for Brisbane and Gyeonggi-do,
respectively. Above these temperatures, the higher the RR. Below these
temperatures, the greater the RR. 59% and 28% are the optimum humidity
(lowest RR) of Gyeonggi-do and Trieste, respectively. Above these humidities, the higher the humidity, the higher the RR. Below these humidities, the
lower the humidity, the higher the RR. From Table 2 below, we can see that
the short-term impact of air temperature and humidity on R0 has apparent
lag and persistence, but there was no evidence that R0 is simply linear with
adjustments in temperature and humidity.
The correlation coefficients of R0 and air pollutants were examined in nine
cities, and 5% was chosen as the significance level. Strong evidence of primary
pollutant was found when PM10 passing the correlation coefficient examine.
Further statistical tests revealed that CO and NO2 are the lowest indicators
passing the significance test. To evaluate the interaction between different
pollutants, and O3 , PM2.5 , and SO2 are incorporated into the DLNM model
as perturbation factors. Air pollutants effect was manifested by Relative Risk
(RR), and Excess morbidity Rate (ER), ER= (RR-1) * 100% denotes the
percentage increase of R0 caused by 14ug/m3 of PM10 . The themes identified
in these responses are summarized in Table 3.

4. Discussion
In this paper, we have used a distributed lag nonlinear model for estimating the time-varying effects of air temperature, humidity, and pollution on
daily R0 . The model combines information across multiple cities to compare
the variation of seasonal relative effect rate estimates. We discovered that the
influence of air temperature and humidity on short-term R0 has apparent lag
and persistence. Temperature and humidity patterns varied by geographic
region, the fluctuation of R0 with temperature and humidity is not linear.
Our results suggest that it has a particular influence on the growth of R0 in
a range of lag. Furthermore, the most prominent finding to emerge from the
analysis is that PM10 as the primary pollutant affecting the growth of R0 ,
which the rise of PM10 concentration will cause an increase of ER, and O3 ,
PM2.5 , and SO2 as perturbation factors also have a particular impact on ER.
The modification of effects of virus by season and air pollution has been
explored previously in several single-city studies. Figure 2 illustrates those
of Hu et al. [12] who also investigated the short-term effect and lag effect of
air environment on disease risk. Styer et al. [20] analyzed data from Cook
County, Illinois, and Salt Lake County, Utah, and found (for Cook County)
that the effect of PM10 was higher in the spring and fall. The estimation of
the short-term impact of air pollution on a single city’s daily confirmed case
is hindered by the high variability inherent in the impact estimates. Estimating the impact of seasonal changes is an additional challenge as it involves
further stratification of the data. Liao et al. [17] investigated the short-term
impact of air pollutants on the number of ILs in Yichang City, China, by applying the distributed lag nonlinear model, and indicated that there was no
statistical significance in the impact of pollutants in winter. Since the early
outbreak of COVID-19 is mainly concentrated in the northern hemisphere,
there are few data available to estimate the seasonal effect, so the variability of this estimation increases, making it difficult to identify any significant
seasonal pattern. Instead, we chose Australia in autumn, South Korea, and
Italy in the spring season, to describe the natural framework of regional and
national trends. Furthermore, the concentration of air pollutants in Italy
and South Korea is much higher than that in Australia, which indicates a
distinct contrast. Based on the statistical results in Table 2, Seoul is the
city with the highest concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 , and one of the cities
with a more severe epidemic. However, we find in Table 4 shows that the
confidence interval is varying under the impact of air pollutants, and sum8

marizes the impact of nine city pollutants on ER. These estimates are based
on the results of the DLNM model when the PM10 concentration drives by
14ug/m3 . Our results suggest that the ER value of Seoul was the highest
(1027.93, 95% confidence interval of RR was 3.40-311740.5) under the union
of PM10 and PM2.5 . The single most striking observation to emerge from
Italy and South Korea data comparison was that cities with severe pollution
have the most significant impact on the ER. There are similarities between
the attitudes expressed by the higher concentration of pollutants cause of the
higher incidence rate in this study and those described by Moolgavkar[18].
It should be noted that this study has investigated only reviewed the
epidemic data of Australia, South Korea, and Italy because each country
immediately offered some control measures at the same time as the epidemic
outbreak. However, we require to calculate the basic reproduction rate (R0 )
that before the control effect. Unfortunately, we can not determine a relatively long R0 sequence from other countries’ data. However, these issues
could be solved if we consider the anti-seasonality of the northern and southern hemispheres; therefore, we chose Italy and South Korea, which has a
relatively long R0 sequence, and different from countries in the southern
hemisphere in terms of season and pollution level. The wide confidence interval of air pollutants is interesting, but not surprising. The research gap
in this study toward the impact of environmental pollution on COVID-19
involves time-series data. Due to each pollution index tends to have a frequent variation with time and the amount of samples is inadequate, multiple
collinearity is easy to associate between them. In the process of regression,
the higher the correlation between independent variables, the more severe the
multicollinearity, so the more significant the variance of the estimated value
of the regression coefficient, the wider the confidence interval [8]. We adopted
the DLNM model to forecast and ensures that the types of independent variables in the future are consistent, and the relationship between independent
variables in the next modeling still has the characteristics of original data.
Consequently, although multiple collinearity variables are included in the
regression model, and solid prediction results can also be obtained.
5. Conclusions
This paper has analyzed the relationship between environment and R0
by using the DLNM model based on Quasi-Poisson regression. The findings
of this study suggest that R0 is affected by seasonal variation (temperature
9

and humidity) and has apparent lag and persistence, and seasonal factors
have an apparent decorating effect on short-term R0 , and PM10 has the most
significant effect on PM10 daily. These findings in this report are subject
to at least three limitations. First, R0 sequences are relatively short, which
is challenging to evaluate lag days. Second, some cities need to be evaluated, which their atmospheric data are missing. Third, there is not sufficient
sample data to assess the impact of four seasons on COVID-19. A further
study could assess the long-term effects of non-homogeneous populations and
establish more complex models.

Figure 4: Spearman correlation analysis of temperature, humidity and air pollution (Seoul)
The upper triangle panel uses circles of different colors and sizes to represent the correlation; Blue represents the positive correlation; Red represents the negative correlation; The
darker the color, the larger the circle represents the higher the correlation, with 5% as the
significance level, and the result declining to pass the statistical correlation test is X; the
lower triangle panel uses the value of correlation coefficient to represent the correlation
direction and size;

HIGHLIGHTS
• Air temperature and humidity have lag and persistence on short-term
R0 .
• Seasonal factors have an apparent decorating effect on R0 .
• PM10 is the primary pollutant that affects the excess morbidity rate.
• O3 , PM2.5 , and SO2 as perturbation factors have cumulative effect on
ER.
