Abstract
As a highly infectious respiratory disease, COVID-19 has become a pandemic that
threatens global health. Without an effective treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions,
such as travel restrictions, have been widely promoted to mitigate the outbreak. Current
studies analyze mobility metrics such as travel distance; however, there is a lack of
research on interzonal travel flow and its impact on the pandemic. Our study specifically
focuses on the inter-county mobility pattern and its influence on the COVID-19 spread in
the United States. To retrieve real-world mobility patterns, we utilize an integrated set of
mobile device location data including over 100 million anonymous devices. We first
investigate the nationwide temporal trend and spatial distribution of inter-county mobility.
Then we zoom in on the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, New York City, and evaluate the
impacts of its outflow on other counties. Finally, we develop a “log-linear double-risk”
model at the county level to quantify the influence of both “external risk” imported by
inter-county mobility flows and the “internal risk” defined as the vulnerability of a county
in terms of population with high-risk phenotypes. Our study enhances the situation
awareness of inter-county mobility in the U.S. and can help improve non-pharmaceutical
interventions for COVID-19.

Background
Since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern, the virus has created an increased threat worldwide. On
March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency, followed by various control
measures at the state and county level. Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission of
COVID-19, population flow is highly correlated to the spread of the disease 1-3. Therefore, most
2

control measures target restricting travel to mitigate the outbreak 1, 4-8. Previous studies found that
restrictions on long-distance travel are effective in the early stage while restrictions on local
travel become more important after the virus disseminates9-12. However, there lacks research on
interzonal population flow at a large scale, especially within the United States. In this study, we
examine the inter-county mobility patterns under various control measures (declaration of a
national emergency, stay-at-home order, partial reopening), which include both local and longdistance travel based on real-world observations. We also specifically investigate New York
City, which saw the largest outbreak in the United States, from two aspects: its role in the intercounty mobility and the impact of outflow from NYC on the outbreak severity in those
destination counties. Moreover, we quantify the impacts of inter-county travel on the spread of
COVID-19 in the United States using a “log-linear double-risk” model. For each county, the
model considers both the external risks (sum of inflow from infected areas weighted by the
outbreak severity in origin counties), and the internal risks (the vulnerability based on high-risk
phenotypes13-15 including people age 65 and over, male, African Americans, and low-income
households). Mobile device location data is known for its capability of capturing timely and realworld trajectories at a large scale. The population flow estimates from mobile device location
data are believed valuable to help curb the pandemic 16-18. We thus consider mobile device
location data as an appropriate data source to estimate the inter-county mobility patterns. To
retrieve the real-world and real-time mobility patterns, we utilize an integrated set of mobile
device location data, which involves over 100 million anonymous devices at a monthly basis.
Based on our previously developed algorithms19, we have estimated daily inter-county trip tables
between 3,143 counties and county-equivalents from January 1, 2020 to May 15, 2020
(weekends and holidays are removed from analysis).

3

Nationwide spatiotemporal patterns of inter-county trips
We first presented the temporal dynamics of nationwide inter-county trips in Fig 1a, where the
total number of inflow inter-county trips of all the counties is examined. Based on the national
trend, we recognized four stages: pre-pandemic (from January 1 to March 13), behavior change
(from March 14 to April 13), quarantine fatigue (from April 14 to April 23), and partial
reopening (after April 23). The pre-pandemic stage experienced a stable level before February 14
and a slight upward trend between February 15 and March 13, when the national emergency was
declared. According to monthly variations of traffic volume, there was supposed to be an upward
trend from January to March20. During the behavior change stage, the inter-county trip volume
rapidly decreased within three weeks and then bottomed out on April 13, when the total intercounty trips decreased by 35%. After that, the inter-county trip total began to bounce back during
the quarantine fatigue stage, which accompanied a consistent increase of confirmed COVID-19
cases. We defined this stage as quarantine fatigue because of an obvious rebound despite
ongoing nationwide travel restrictions. On the week of April 24, states began deploying local
phase-by-phase reopening plans by partially reopening selected businesses. During this stage, the
inter-county trip volume kept rising even though the increase in confirmed cases had not slowed
down.
We further evaluated the spatial differences between counties regarding the changes of total inflow inter-county trips and such trips specifically from NYC (Fig. 1b, c, d, e). We calculated the
weekday average from January 2 to January 31 excluding holidays as the baseline (Fig. 1b).
Then we computed the weekday average week after week and the percentage change compared
with the baseline. The week of March 9 presented widely increase instead of reduction (Fig. 1c)
while the week of April 6 showed the most reduction (Fig. 1d). Overall, eastern counties present
4

a more significant reduction than western counties. For the week of the national emergency
declaration, 83% of counties still showed a percentage increase in the in-flow inter-county trips
while the five counties in NYC show a slight reduction of inflow trips ranging from -5% to 0
(Fig. 1c). It may imply that travelers were cancelling trips to NYC or relocating themselves to
places with lower infection risk. Compared with the daily average number of destination counties
in January, 554 (17% of all counties), the inter-county trips from NYC still had a widespread
distribution ending at 518 destination counties (16% of all counties). During the week of April 6,
92% of counties experienced a percentage reduction in in-flow inter-county trips, and the spatial
distribution of inter-county trips from NYC was clearly narrowed down to 272 (8%) destination
counties. During the most recent week, 48% of counties show a percentage increase in inflow
trips, especially in western counties (Fig. 1e).
After evaluating the inflow inter-county volume at each county, we specifically investigated the
greater New York City (NYC) area, consisting of New York County, Bronx County, Queens
County, Kings County, and Richmond County, due to its intensive travel interactions with other
counties. As the largest transportation hub and the most densely populated city in the United
States, NYC became the U.S. epicenter at an early stage. We evaluated four metrics related to
inter-county trips for NYC: total inflow trips, total outflow trips, the number of origin counties
accounting for those inflow trips, and the number of destination counties accounting for those
outflow trips (Extended Fig. 1). We found that NYC stayed in the top three even after national
emergency in all those four aspects when compared with other counties. This raised concerns on
inter-county disease transmissions.

5

Influence of the inter-county trips from New York City on the local outbreak
From January 1 to May 15, the inter-county trips from NYC directly distributed to 42% counties
in the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, and might have a wider impact considering
the final destinations of those trips. Despite that the inter-county trips generated from NYC have
been reduced by 60% at the most, the overall volume is still high compared with other counties.
We first evaluated the influence of such trips on local outbreaks by zooming in on the top twelve
destination counties (Fig. 2). Fig. 2b shows the temporal changes of inter-county trips coming
from NYC to the top twelve destination counties, and Fig. 2a shows the temporal changes in the
cumulative cases in those counties. Nassau County and Westchester County in New York are the
two counties with most inter-county trips from NYC before the pandemic. Therefore, they also
have the most cumulative cases during the first three weeks after the pandemic began. As the
confirmed cases increased, Nassau County and Westchester County experienced a sharp decrease
in the trip volume from NYC. In the meantime, the decrease in trips to Suffolk County, NY was
not as significant, which later made Suffolk County succeed Nassau County as the county with
the second-most confirmed cases. Although Hudson ranked third before pandemic, it has
experienced the maximum percentage reduction in the inter-county trips from NYC and thus had
a lower rank in confirmed cases.
As the influence of inter-county trips from NYC was unveiled, we further investigated the
impacts by examining the day-by-day correlations between such trips and the cumulative
COVID-19 cases per capita (per thousand people) of the 1360 destination counties. Since
COVID-19 has an incubation period, we have considered four scenarios: no time lag, one-week
lag, two-week lag, and three-week lag (Fig. 3). For example, the one-week lag scenario
calculates the correlation between the inter-county trip volume from NYC and the cumulative
6

case number per capita one week later. Overall, there is a significant positive correlation between
inter-county trips from NYC and the outbreak severity in the destination county. The correlation
became more significant as the outbreak kept spreading. And it can be as high as 0.68 (Pearson’s
r) on Apr 23 in the three-week lag scenario and 0.72 (Spearman’s rs) on Apr 22 in the threeweek lag scenario. Among the four scenarios, the ones with time lag show a stronger correlation
than that without time lag, and the correlation strength is similar between the ones with time lag.
We thus conclude that travel from severely infected areas would significantly contribute to local
outbreaks with time lags.

Quantifying the influence of the inter-county trips via “log-linear double-risk” models
Following the case study in NYC, we expanded our study to quantifying the general influence of
inter-county trips from all the infected counties. We innovatively developed a “log-linear doublerisk” model, which considers both the external risks of the inter-county trips from infected
counties and the internal risks in terms of the vulnerability of local populations. For a given
county, the external risk (ER) is measured by the sum of inter-county trips from different
counties with each sub-flow weighted by the cumulative cases per capita (per thousand people)
in the origin county. The internal risk is defined as a weighted sum of socio-demographic
indicators based on high-risk phenotypes13-15, including percentage of people 65 years and over,
percentage of male, percentage of African-American, and median household income. The model
is specified as follows.
log 𝑆

𝐸𝑅 =

= 𝛼 log 𝐸𝑅 + 𝐼𝑅 + 𝛾

𝑤 𝐸 ,𝑤 =

𝐶𝑢𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟
× 1000
𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
7

𝐼𝑅 = 𝛽 𝐴𝑔𝑒 + 𝛽 𝑀𝑎𝑙𝑒 + 𝛽 𝐴𝑓𝑟𝑖 + 𝛽 𝐼𝑛𝑐
Where 𝑆 is the outbreak severity of county 𝑗 measured by the cumulative cases per 1000 people
with time lag 𝑇, where 𝑇 equals to 0, 1, 2, 3 for no time lag, one-week lag, two-week lag, and
three-week lag, respectively; 𝐸𝑅 is the external risk for county 𝑗; 𝑁 is the number of origin
counties that generate inter-county trips to county 𝑗; 𝐸 is the trips from county 𝑖 to county 𝑗,
where 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗; 𝑤 is the weight for inter-county trips originated from county 𝑖; 𝐼𝑅 is the internal
risk for county 𝑗; 𝛼 is the coefficient for the logarithm to the base 10 of the external risk; 𝛽 , 𝛽 ,
𝛽 , and 𝛽 are the coefficients for the internal risks, including the percentage of senior people
(𝐴𝑔𝑒 ), male (𝑀𝑎𝑙𝑒 ), African-American (𝐴𝑓𝑟𝑖 ), and the county-level median income (𝐼𝑛𝑐 ); 𝛾
is the constant in the model.
We fit the model into twenty scenarios as shown in Fig. 4. The results show that the model with
one-week lag outperforms the others when applied to the whole after-pandemic announcement
period (the combination of behavior change, quarantine fatigue, and partial reopening) with
R2=0.62. For individual stages, the models with shorter time lags have a better fit, which may
imply that the community transmissions contribute more to the outbreak severity than the
imported cases from other counties. Another possible reason is that most inter-county trips are
conducted by residents regularly, e.g., daily, which reduces the significance of an incubation
period. Besides, the models fit the data better in the later stages. It may indicate that our
assumption for the external risks, where the infected ratio of inter-county travelers is the same as
that of the entire population in the origin county, became more literal along with the spread of
COVID-19. Moreover, the model shows that the logged external risk is much more important
than internal risk by improving R2 significantly (Extended Table 1).

Discussion
This study focuses on the population flow between all counties in the U.S. and inspects how
inter-county trips aggravate COVID-19 to provide insights into the epidemiological situation in
the U.S. First, the study is based on aggregate population flow at a large scale by leveraging
integrated mobility location data from over 100 million anonymous devices. Such derived
population flow data is quite valuable to help fight against the pandemic. Moreover, our study
distinguishes itself for the following reasons. Current studies usually analyze the change of
common mobility metrics under the impact of COVID-19, such as percentage of people staying
home, miles traveled per person, or number of trips per person 21, 22. There is a lack of research on
how those mobility metrics influence the spread of COVID-19. Very limited research have
studied the impact of population outflow from the Chinese epicenter, Wuhan, on the pandemic 5,
23

. However, the epidemiological situation in the U.S. is quite different from China because of

multiple epicenters in the early stage, relatively less rigorous travel restrictions, and partial
reopening amid COVID-19. This epidemiological situation in the U.S. necessitates an analysis of
large-scale population flow between local regions. Our study fills this research gap by analyzing
the trips between counties in the U.S., especially the aggravating impact on COVID-19. Not only
do we analyze the outflow trips generated by New York City, the largest epicenter in the U.S.,
we also examine the mobility pattern of the large-scale inter-county trips. We found that the
reduction of national total inter-county trips is only 35% at the most. Within four weeks of the
national emergency, the inter-county trips begin to rebound nationwide despite ongoing stay-athome orders, which keep rising. With the partial reopening of society, quantifying the influence
of inter-county population flow on the pandemic cannot be ignored. The informative findings
regarding spatiotemporal patterns of the inter-county trips in our paper enhance the situational

9

awareness of mobility in the U.S. Furthermore, our paper analyzes the deteriorating effect of
inter-county trips on the pandemic using an innovatively-developed “log-linear double-risk”
model, which considers both external risk (sum of inflow inter-county trips weighted by local
outbreak severity in each trip origin) and internal risk (the vulnerability based on high-risk
phenotypes including people age 65 and older, male, African-American, and low-income).
Twenty scenarios considering different time lags and periods are compared. As for the whole
after-pandemic announcement period, the one-week-time-lagged model had the best fitness
(R2=0.62), which is consistent with the research findings that the mean/median incubation period
ranges from 4 to 7 days and most cases develop symptoms within 14 days 3, 24-27. Our study
contributes to the non-pharmacological interventions on COVID-19 in the U.S. by analyzing the
between-county population flow at a large scale. Especially now with partial reopening started in
all 50 states, our model is promising to assist policymakers.

differences between counties. (a) The temporal change of national total inflow inter-county
trips (dark-blue line) from Jan 2, 2020 to May 15, 2020. Only weekdays and no holidays are
plotted with dates on x-axis that are Mondays. The three-day moving average (light-blue line)
shows the trend. Meanwhile, national total cumulative COVID-19 cases are shown for
comparison (red line). The three dashed dividing lines on dates Mar 13, Apr 13, and Apr 24,
respectively, form four stages: pre-pandemic, behavior change, quarantine fatigue, and partial
14

reopening. (b) The blue-to-orange color indicates the baseline of each county: the weekdays’ (no
holidays) average of inflow inter-county trips by counties from Jan 2 to Jan 31. All counties
differ from each other regarding baseline value. The red dots present the spatial distribution of
outflow trips produced by New York City and the dot size for each destination county indicates
the volume of inflow trips originating in NYC. Considering the overlapped red dots, the NYC
area is enlarged in the square frame. (c), (d), (e) The percentage change of inflow inter-county
trips by counties relative to the baseline (b): the weekdays’ (no holidays) average for the week of
national emergency (c), the week with the least inflow trips (d), and the most recent week of
studied period (e). The red dots have the same meaning as (b). Although long-distance trips from
NYC clearly decrease after the national emergency is announced, NYC keeps influencing nearby
counties.

shows the importance of logged external risk relative to the internal risk for modeling result (R2)
under scenarios of different periods and types of time lag. For each scenario, the model is built
twice: with and without permuting logged external risk. Permuting logged external risk means
that the model only includes internal risk, while not permuting means both logged external risk
and internal risk are included in the model. For any scenario, the logged external risk shows its
significant importance by improving R2 value.
