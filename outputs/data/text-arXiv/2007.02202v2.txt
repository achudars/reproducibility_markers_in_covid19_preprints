Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly worldwide, leading to a
global outbreak. Most governments, enterprises, and scientific research institutions are participating in
the COVID-19 struggle to curb the spread of the pandemic. As a powerful tool against COVID-19,
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are widely used in combating this pandemic. In this survey, we
investigate the main scope and contributions of AI in combating COVID-19 from the aspects of disease
detection and diagnosis, virology and pathogenesis, drug and vaccine development, and epidemic and
transmission prediction. In addition, we summarize the available data and resources that can be used for
AI-based COVID-19 research. Finally, the main challenges and potential directions of AI in fighting
against COVID-19 are discussed. Currently, AI mainly focuses on medical image inspection, genomics,
drug development, and transmission prediction, and thus AI still has great potential in this field. This
survey presents medical and AI researchers with a comprehensive view of the existing and potential
applications of AI technology in combating COVID-19 with the goal of inspiring researchers to continue
to maximize the advantages of AI and big data to fight COVID-19.

Introduction

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona-Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging human infectious
coronavirus. Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2
was first reported in China and later in most countries in the world [10, 59, 223]. The World Health
Organization (WHO) announced on January 30, 2020, that the outbreak was a Public Health Emergency
of International Concern (PHEIC), and confirmed COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of
February 26, 2021, this disease has been reported in 216 countries or regions around the world and has
resulted in serious consequences, including 112,649,371 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 2,501,229
deaths [220].
Most governments, enterprises, and scientific research institutions are fighting COVID-19 from all
aspects to curb the spread of the disease [48, 54, 58, 145]. Various stakeholders from different institutions
and backgrounds have provided abundant resources and capabilities to support this disease
battle [14, 34, 52, 61, 131, 140, 206]. As far as SARS-CoV-2 is concerned, virology, origin and classification,
physicochemical properties, receptor interactions, cell entry, genomic variation, and ecology are
thoroughly studied [7, 78, 123, 123, 221, 243]. Nucleic acid testing, serologic diagnosis, and medical
imaging (i.e., chest X-ray or CT imaging) are the main disease detection and diagnosis methods at

1/37

present [31, 85, 106, 203, 229]. In terms of pathogenesis, topics such as virus entry and spread,
pathological findings, and immune response are the focus [148, 201, 211, 212]. In epidemiology, extensive
research has been conducted on the source and spectrum of infection, clinical features, epidemiological
characteristics, epidemic prediction, and transmission route tracking [27, 116, 224, 225]. Potential
therapeutics of COVID-19 include intensive care, drug development, and vaccine
development [36, 119, 152, 205]. In addition, communication prediction and social isolation are currently
the main social control methods [1, 98, 160, 237].
Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as a technology that allows computers to imitate human
intelligence to process things, including Machine Learning (ML), knowledge graphs, natural language
processing, human-computer interaction, computer vision, biometrics, virtual reality, and augmented
reality [26, 115, 195]. ML can be subdivided into traditional ML and deep learning (DL). Traditional ML
methods include logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, Adaboost, K-means
clustering, density clustering, hidden Markov models, support vector machine, Naive Bayes,
etc [20, 125, 143]. DL is a subset of ML and is a learning method for building deep structural neural
networking models [66, 192]. In addition, ML techniques also include transfer learning, active learning,
and evolutionary learning. In recent years, AI technology has achieved technological breakthroughs and
is widely used in various fields of intelligent medicine, including medical image inspection,
disease-assisted diagnosis, surgery, hospital management, and medical big data integration [195].
Moreover, AI is actively explored in emerging fields such as surgical robots, wearable devices, new drug
discovery, precision medicine, epidemics prevention and control, and gene sequencing.
Encouragingly, in the short period of time since the outbreak of COVID-19, research in the fields of
industry, medical, and science has successfully used advanced AI technologies in the COVID-19 battle
and has achieved significant progress. For example, AI supports the diagnosis of COVID-19 through
medical image inspections and provides non-invasive detection solutions to prevent medical personnel
from contracting infections [4, 26, 115]. AI is used in virology research to analyze the structure of
SARS-CoV-2-related proteins and predict new compounds that can be used in drug and vaccine
development [22, 137, 244]. In addition, AI has achieved virus source tracking through genomic research,
and has successfully discovered the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat virus, as well as the
relationship between SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) [47, 147, 167]. Moreover, AI learns large-scale COVID-19 case data and social media data
to construct epidemic transmission models to accurately predict the outbreak time, transmission route,
transmission range, and impact of the disease [117, 149, 155, 173]. AI is also widely used in epidemic
prevention and social control, such as airport security inspections, patient trajectory tracking, and
epidemic visualization [166, 166]. There are some studies and surveys on the COVID-19 epidemic and the
related machine learning or artificial intelligence applications. For example, in [187], Shinde et al.
summarized various forecasting techniques for COVID-19, including stochastic theory, mathematical
models, data science, and machine learning techniques. In [183], Shi et al. provided a survey of AI
techniques in imaging data collection, segmentation and diagnosis of COVID-19. However, most of the
existing work only focuses on one or more narrow fields of the COVID-19 fight, leaving readers difficult
to know the scope of the current research on COVID-19.
In this survey, we present a comprehensive view of the landscape and contributions of AI in
combating COVID-19. The main scope of AI in COVID-19 research includes disease detection and
diagnosis, virology and pathogenesis, drug and vaccine development, and epidemic and transmission
prediction. Note that due to the rapid development of the COVID-19 epidemic, we cited many
preprinted references for a comprehensive investigation, which still need to be assessed on their accuracy
and quality through peer review. The main scope of AI in combating COVID-19 is summarized in Fig. 1.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 to 5 discuss the four main scope of AI against
COVID-19. Section 6 summarizes the available data and resources to support COVID-19 research.
Section 7 highlights the challenges and potential directions in this field. Finally, Section 8 presents the
conclusion. Table 1 gives the abbreviations and descriptions of the AI methods used in this survey.

Disease Detection and Diagnosis

The diagnosis of virus infection is an important part of COVID-19 research. The current detection and
diagnosis methods used for SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease mainly include nucleic acid testing,
serological diagnosis, chest X-ray and CT image inspection, and other noninvasive methods.

2.1

RT-PCR Detection

Benefitting from the advantages of high sensitivity and specificity, real-time Reverse Transcriptase
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the current standard detection technology in diagnosing the
SARS-CoV-2 virus and bacterial infections. Using RT-PCR, 9 RNA positives were detected from
pharyngeal swabs of patients, indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had spread in communities of
Wuhan, China, in early January 2020 [106]. The shedding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus detected in the
throat, lungs, and feces suggests multiple routes of virus transmission [221, 229]. However, RT-PCR faces
the limitations of complicated sample preparation, low detection efficiency, and high false-negative
rate [106, 216, 226].
Isothermal nucleic acid amplification and blood testing methods are also commonly used for rapid
screening of SARS-CoV-2 [102, 122, 226]. An ML classification method was used for blood testing to
extract important routine hematological and biochemical characteristics and to provide COVID-19
classification. In [226], 105 blood test reports were collected, of which 27 were positive samples from
patients with confirmed COVID-19. For comparison, negative samples were collected from patients with
ordinary pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. Each sample contains 49 feature variables, including
24 routine hematological and 25 biochemical parameters. Next, the authors implemented the RF
algorithm [20] on the training samples for feature learning and classification. Based on the extracted 11
key feature variables, they built an RF classifier and tested 253 samples of 169 patients with suspected
COVID-19 and obtained an accuracy of 96.97%. Although AI technologies rarely directly participate in
RT-PCR and blood testing, the viral load and COVID-19 case data collected in these methods provide
important data sources for the subsequent AI-based analysis.

2.2

Medical Image Inspection

Medical imaging inspection is another widely used clinical approach for COVID-19 detection and
diagnosis. COVID-19 medical image inspection mainly includes chest X-ray and lung CT imaging. AI
technology plays an important role in medical image inspection and has achieved significant results in
image acquisition, organ recognition, infection region segmentation, and disease classification. It not only
greatly shortens the imaging diagnosis time of radiologists, but also improves the accuracy the diagnosis.
We will discuss in detail the contributions of AI methods to chest X-ray and lung CT imaging.
2.2.1

CT Image Inspection

CT imaging provides an important basis for the early diagnosis of COVID-19. The CT imaging
manifestations of COVID-19 are mainly Ground Glass Opacity (GGO) in the periphery of the subpleural
region, and some are consolidated. If a patient’s COVID-19 condition improves, the area will be
absorbed and form fibrous stripes [43, 164, 190]. Examples of lung CT images of normal and COVID-19
cases are shown in Fig. 2.
The progress of AI-based CT image inspection for COVID-19 usually includes the following steps:
Region Of Interest (ROI) segmentation, lung tissue feature extraction, candidate infection region
detection, and COVID-19 classification. The representative AI architecture for CT image classification
and COVID-19 inspection is shown in Fig. 3.
The segmentation of lung organs and ROIs is the foundational step in AI-based image inspection. It
depicts the ROIs in lung CT images (i.e., lungs, lung lobes, bronchopulmonary segments, and infected
regions or lesions) for further evaluation and quantification. Different DL models (i.e., U-Net, V-Net,
and VB-Net) have been used for CT image segmentation [33, 115, 198, 228]. In [181], Shan et al. collected

4/37

Figure 2. Examples of lung CT images of normal and COVID-19 cases.

Figure 3. Representative AI architecture for CT image classification and COVID-19 inspection.

549 CT images from patients with confirmed COVID-19 and proposed an improved segmentation model
(called VB-Net) based on the V-Net [118] and ResNet [69] models. In [33], Chen et al. established a DL
model based on the U-Net++ structure [245] to extract the ROIs from each CT image and detect the
training curve of suspicious lesions. In [228], Xu et al. used a 3D DL model to segment the infection
regions from lung CT images. Then, they built a classification model using ResNet and
location-attention structures, and divided the segmented regional images into three categories, such as
COVID-19, influenza-A viral pneumonia, and normal. In [115], Li et al. used the U-Net segmentation
model to extract lung organs as ROIs from each lung CT image. In [198], Tang et al. used the VB-Net
model [181] to accurately segment 18 lung regions and infected regions from lung CT images, and further
calculated 63 quantitative features.
Focusing on the detection and location of candidate infection regions, different AI methods were
proposed in [65, 87, 185, 216]. In [65], Gozes et al. used commercial software to identify lung nodules and
small opacity in the 3D lung volume. Then, they constructed a DL model composed of the U-Net and
ResNet structures, where the U-Net module was used to extract the ROI regions, and the ResNet model
was used to detect and classify diffuse turbidity and ground glass infiltration. In addition, they
compared the CT images of 56 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 101 non-coronavirus patients,
and analyzed the CT features of COVID-19 in detail. In [185], Shi et al. used a V-Net-based CNN model
to segment lung organs and infected regions from lung CT images. Then, they used the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method to calculate the best CT morphological features.
Finally, based on the best CT morphology and clinical features, the severity of COVID-19 was predicted

5/37

and evaluated. In [216], Wang et al. collected 195 CT images from 44 patients with COVID-19 and 258
CT images from 55 negative patients. They used the CNN model with the Inception structure [196] to
classify randomly selected ROI images and predict COVID-19 disease. In [87], Huang et al. used an
InferReadTM CT pneumonia tool based on AI to quantitatively evaluate changes in the lung burden of
patients with COVID-19. The tool includes three modules: lung and lobe extraction, pneumonia
segmentation, and quantitative analysis. The CT image features of COVID-19 pneumonia are divided
into four types: mild, moderate, severe, and critical.
Based on ROI segmentation and candidate infection region detection, the important features of ROIs
and infection regions are extracted for COVID-19 classification [159]. In [159], Qi et al. collected 71 CT
images from 52 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in 5 hospitals. They used radiobiological methods to
extract 1,218 features from each CT image, and then performed LR and RF methods on these features
to distinguish between short-term and long-term hospital stays. In [184], Shi et al. used the VB-Net
model [181] to segment lung and infection regions from CT images, and classified them based on 96
features (including 26 volume features, 31 digital features, 32 histogram features, and 7 surface features).
Next, they proposed an iSARF method to classify features and predict COVID-19 disease. Comparative
experiments show that the iSARF method is superior to LR, SVM, and NN methods. In [242], Zheng et
al. proposed a 3D DCNN model (called DeCoVNet) to detect COVID-19 from CT images. The proposed
DeCoVNet model includes three components: the first component uses vanilla 3D convolutional layers to
extract lung image features, the second component consists of two 3D residual blocks, which perform
element conversion on the 3D feature maps, and the third component gradually extracts the information
in the 3D feature map through 3D max-pooling, and outputs the probability of COVID-19. In [193],
Song et al. collected 1990 CT images, including 777 images from 88 patients with COVID-19, 505 images
from 100 patients with bacterial pneumonia, and 708 images from 86 healthy people. They proposed a
DRE-Net DL model based on a pre-trained ResNet50 structure and a functional pyramid network. The
DRE-Net model extracts the top-K lesion features from each CT image to predict the classification of
patients with COVID-19.
The lack of large-scale data sets is the main challenge that hinders the implementation of AI-based
CT image inspection and affects diagnostic performance. To address these challenges, strategies such as
transfer learning, data augmentation, and “Human-In-The-Loop” were used in [181, 240]. In [240], Zhao
et al. provided a public COVID-19 CT scan data set, including 275 COVID-19 cases and 195
non-COVID-19 cases. They used data augmentation and TL methods to alleviate the shortage of
training data. In terms of data augmentation, they used transformation operations to expand the
training data set, such as random transformation, cropping, and rotation. In terms of TL, they
pre-trained the DenseNet model [86] on the chest X-ray data set [217], and then used the pre-trained
model to predict COVID-19. In addition, the strategy of “Human-In-The-Loop” was adopted to reduce
the workload of radiologists when annotating training samples [181]. The radiologists annotated a small
portion of training samples in the first batch of training. Then, they manually corrected the
segmentation results in the second batch and used them as annotations for the images. Iterative training
is performed in this way to complete the annotation of all training samples.
It is commendable that several works provide open-source code of the designed models and online
COVID-19 CT image inspection systems. For example, Li [115], Zheng [242], and Zhao [240] published
the proposed DL models on GitHub [89]. In addition, Song et al. provided an online CT diagnosis
service [193], and Wang et al. provided a public website for uploading and testing lung CT images [216].
In [33], Chen et al. developed a public online CT diagnostic system, and anyone can upload CT images
for self-diagnosis. More detailed information about AI-based CT image segmentation and classification
methods is provided in Table 2 and Fig. 4.
2.2.2

Chest X-ray Image Inspection

Compared with CT images, chest X-ray (CXR) images are easier to obtain in radiological inspections.
Although CXR imaging is a typical imaging method used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, it is generally
considered to be less sensitive than CT imaging. Some CXR images of patients with early COVID-19
showed normal characteristics. Radiological signs of COVID-19 CXR images include airspace opacity,

GGO, and later mergers. In addition, the distribution of bilateral, peripheral, and lower regions is
mainly observed [124, 163]. Examples of CXR images of normal and COVID-19 cases are shown in Fig. 5.
The AI-based CXR image inspection usually includes steps such as data preprocessing, DL model
training, and COVID-19 classification. The representative AI architecture for CXR image classification
and COVID-19 inspection is shown in Fig. 6.
Unlike CT images, CXR image segmentation is more challenging because the ribs are projected onto
soft tissues, which is confused with image contrast. In this way, most DL models focus on the
classification of the entire CXR image, while few works are devoted to segmenting the ROIs and lung
organs from CXR images. In [67], Mahdy et al. used a classification method to classify COVID-19 on

7/37

Figure 5. Examples of chest X-ray images of normal and COVID-19 cases.

Figure 6. Representative AI architecture for CXR image classification and COVID-19 inspection.

CXR images through a multilevel threshold and SVM. A multilevel image segmentation threshold was
used to segment lung organs from the background, and then the SVM module was used to classify the
infected lungs from the uninfected lungs.
Focusing on the classification of COVID-19 based on CXR images, several studies built AI-based
classification models by nesting or combining existing ML and DL models. In [73], Hemdan et al.
proposed a DL framework (called COVIDX-Net) to help radiologists automatically diagnose COVID-19
based on CXR images. The proposed framework integrates 7 DCNN models with different structures,
such as VGG19 [188], DenseNet201 [86], ResNetV2 [30], InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2 [195],
Xception [39], and MobileNetV2 [172]. Each model is separately trained on CXR images to classify the
patient’s status as COVID-19 positive or negative. In [180], Sethy et al. used different DCNN models in
a SVM classifier to diagnose COVID-19 based on CXR images. Eleven DCNN models are used as image
feature extractors, including AlexNet, GoogLeNet, DenseNet, Inception, ResNet, VGG, XceptionNet,
and InceptionResNet. Then, the SVM classifier classifies the extracted image features to determine
whether the input image is COVID-19. In [26], Castiglioni et al. collected CXR data (610 images,
including 324 COVID-19 cases) from Lombardy, Italy, and constructed a DCNN model to predict

8/37

COVID-19. The DCNN model is equipped with 10 CNN models, each of them uses the ResNet-50
structure and has been pre-trained on the ImageNet data set. In [9], Ioannis et al. evaluated the
performance of 5 DCNN models for medical image classification, including VGG19, MobileNetV2,
Inception, Xception, and InceptionResNetV2. To address the shortcomings of the small-scale COVID-19
data set, each model is pre-trained on the ImageNet data set using the TL strategy. In [138], Narin et al.
also used 3 typical DCNN models (i.e., ResNet50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2) to classify
COVID-19 from a small-scale CXR data set (100 images, including 50 COVID-19 cases).
Another group of works constructed specific DL models for COVID-19 classification [238]. For
example, Zhang et al. proposed a new DL model, which consists of a backbone network, a classification
module, and an anomaly detection module [238]. The backbone network extracts the features of each
input CXR image. The classification and anomaly detection modules respectively use the extracted
features to generate classification scores and scalar anomaly scores. In [214], Wang et al. introduced a
COVID-Net DCNN model to identify COVID-19 cases based on CXR images. The COVID-Net model
uses a large number of convolutional layers in a projection-expansion-projection design pattern. They
collected 13,800 CXR images from 13,725 patients (including 183 COVID-19 patients) to establish a
CXR database (called COVIDx) for training COVID-Net. It is commendable that the authors provided
an open-source code of the proposed model and the COVIDx database.
Similar to CT images, in CXR image inspection, there is also a lack of large-scale data sets for DL
model training. In [127], Maghdid et al. respectively used CNN and AlexNet [110] models to train CXR
and CT images and diagnose COVID-19 cases. Among them, the AlexNet model is pre-trained on the
ImageNet data set to perform COVID-19 classification on the data sets in [40, 124, 141]. Unlike existing
TL and image augmentation methods, Afshar et al. designed a capsule network model (named
COVID-CAPS) suitable for small-scale CXR data sets [2]. Each layer of the COVID-CAPS model
contains multiple capsules, and each capsule represents a specific image instance at a specific position
through multiple neurons. The capsule module [75] uses protocol routing to capture alternative models
of spatial information and attempts to reach a consensus on the existence of objects. In this way, the
protocol uses information from instances and objects to identify the relationship between them without
the need for large-scale data sets. More detailed information about AI-based methods for CXR image
classification and COVID-19 inspection is shown in Table 3 and Fig. 7.

Other Detection Technologies

In addition to RT-PCR detection and image inspection techniques, some noninvasive measurement
methods have also been used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, including cough sound judgment and
breathing pattern detection.
(1) Monitoring COVID-19 through AI-based cough sound analysis.
In [176], Schuller et al. discussed the potential application of computer audition (CA) and AI in
analyzing the cough sounds of patients with COVID-19. They first analyzed the ability of CA to
automatically recognize and monitor speech and cough under different semantics (such as breathing, dry
and wet coughing or sneezing, speech during colds, eating behaviors, drowsiness, or pain). Then, they
applied the CA technology to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19. However, due to
the lack of available data sets and annotation information, there are few studies on this technology in
diagnosing COVID-19. It is encouraging that Orlandic et al. provided a COUGHVID cough dataset for
COVID-19 diagnosis, which contains 20,000 crowdsourced cough records [146]. The cough records are
labeled by experienced pulmonologists, and medical abnormalities are accurately diagnosed, thus
providing a high-quality training dataset for MI/AI methods. Similarly, in [91], Iqbal et al. also discussed
an abstract framework that uses the voice recognition function of mobile applications to capture and
analyze the cough sounds of suspicious persons to determine whether they are healthy or suffering from a
respiratory disease. In [218], Wang et al. analyzed the respiratory patterns of patients with COVID-19
and other breathing patterns of patients with influenza and common cold. In addition, they proposed a
respiratory simulation model (called BI-AT-GRU) for COVID-19 diagnosis. The BI-AT-GRU model
includes a GRU neural network with a bidirectional and attention mechanism, and can classify 6 types of
clinical respiratory patterns, such as Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots, Cheyne-Stokes, and
Central-Apnea. To facilitate the analysis of COVID-19 cough sounds, we further collect 8 groups of
human cough sound datasets containing patients with confirmed COVID-19, as shown in Table 8.
(2) COVID-19 diagnosis based on non-invasive measurements.
In [128], Maghdid et al. designed an abstract framework for COVID-19 diagnosis based on smart

10/37

phone sensors. In the proposed framework, smart phones can be used to collect the disease characteristics
of potential patients. For example, the sensor can acquire the patient’s voice through the recording
function and the patient’s body temperature through the fingerprint recognition function. Then, the
collected data are submitted to an AI-supported cloud server for disease diagnosis and analysis.

Virology and Pathogenesis

The virology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is the most important scientific research in the fields of
biology and medicine. Scientists have analyzed the virus characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 through
proteomics and genomic studies [7, 78, 123]. In the field of virology, the origin and classification of
SARS-CoV-2, physical and chemical properties, receptor interactions, cell entry, and the ecology and
genomic variation of SARS-CoV-2 have been studied [123, 221, 243]. We mainly discuss the contribution
of AI in the pathological research of SARS-CoV-2 from the perspective of proteomics and genomics.

3.1

Proteomics

Since the advent of SARS-CoV-2, there have been a large number of research achievements in proteomics.
Five types of structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been confirmed, including nucleocapsid (N)
proteins, envelope (E) proteins, membrane (M) proteins, and spike (S) proteins [147, 211, 241]. Other
proteins translated in the host cells essential for virus replication, such as non-structural protein 5
(NSP5) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro), have also attracted the attention of researchers. In addition,
several studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 uses the human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2)
to enter the host [78, 243]. In this field, AI techniques are used to predict protein structures and analyze
the interaction network between proteins and drugs. The representative AI architecture used for protein
structure prediction is shown in Fig. 8.

Figure 8. Representative AI architecture used for protein structure predication.
In [178, 179], Senior et al. used DL models to implement the AlphaFold system for protein structure
prediction. The AlphaFold system uses the ResNet model [69] to analyze the covariance and amino acid
residue contacts in the homologous gene sequences, and predict the corresponding protein structures.
The AlphaFold system consists of a feature extraction module and a distance prediction neural network.
The feature extraction module is responsible for searching for protein sequences similar to the input
protein sequences and constructing multiple sequence alignments (MSA). The module simultaneously
generates residual position and sequence contour features, and inputs the output of 485 feature
parameters into the distance prediction neural network. The distance prediction neural network is a
two-dimensional (2D) ResNet structure, which is responsible for accurately predicting the distance
between all residue pairs in every two protein sequences. The authors added a one-dimensional output
layer to the network to predict the accessible surface area, distance map, and secondary structure of each
residue. Finally, the generated potential is optimized by gradient descent to generate protein structures.

11/37

Based on [178, 179], Jumper et al. used the AlphaFold system to predict the structure of
SARS-CoV-2 membrane proteins [95]. They published the predicted protein structures such as 3a, Nsp2,
Nsp4, Nsp6, and papain-like proteases. Although the structure of these proteins has not been verified by
clinical trials, this publication allows researchers to quickly conduct SARA-CoV-2 studies. In [147],
Ortega et al. used a computational method to detect changes in the S1 subunit of the spike
receptor-binding domain and identify mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence, which may
be beneficial for studying human-to-human transmission. They collected sequences from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) [17] and used the SWISS-MODEL software [11] to construct a SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein model. Then, the Z-dock software [153] was used to dock the spike protein and ACE2, and a
clustering algorithm was used to cluster the docking results. The work indicated that the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein has a higher affinity for human ACE2 receptors.
Another branch of AI-assisted proteomics research involves finding new compounds and drug
candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 by building an interactive network and knowledge graph
between proteins and drugs. Please see Section 4 for details.

3.2

Genomics

Genomics is mainly used in SARS-CoV-2 to analyze the origin of SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development,
and PT-PCR detection. Various AI algorithms are applied to compare the similarity of gene sequences,
gene fragments, and miRNA predictions [47, 167]. In [167], Randhawa et al. used different ML methods
to analyze the pathogen sequence of COVID-19, and identified the inherent characteristics of the viral
genomes, thereby rapidly classifying new pathogens. They collected the complete reference genome of
the COVID virus from NCBI [52], the bat β-coronavirus from GISAID [61], and all available virus
sequences from Virus-Host DB [135]. By using chaotic game representation, each genomic sequence was
mapped to the corresponding genomic signal in a discrete digital sequence [94]. In addition, the
amplitude spectrum of these genomic signals was calculated by using a discrete Fourier transform. On
this basis, they used 6 ML classification models to train the above sequence distance matrix and
compared their performance. Finally, they conducted the trained ML models on 29 COVID-19 sequences
to classify COVID-19 pathogens. The results of this work support the hypothesis that COVID-19
originated in bats and its classification as a β-coronavirus.
In addition, the amplitude spectrum of these genomic signals is calculated by using a discrete Fourier
transform. On this basis, they used 6 ML classification models (such as linear discriminant, linear SVM,
quadratic SVM, fine KNN, subspace discriminant, and subspace KNN) to train the sequence distance
matrix and compared their performance. Finally, they performed a well-trained ML model on 29
COVID-19 sequences to classify COVID-19 pathogens. The results of this work support the following
hypothesis: COVID-19 originated in bats and is classified as type β-coronavirus.
In [47], based on three ML methods (such as DT, Naive Bayes, and RF), Demirci et al. performed
miRNA prediction on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and identified miRNA-like hairpins and
microRNA-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection interactions. They collected the complete COVID-19
genome from NCBI [52] and human-mature miRNA sequences from miRBase [109]. The genomic
sequences are transcribed and divided into multiple overlapping fragments, which are folded into a
secondary structure to extract the hairpin structure. On this basis, the authors used the three ML
methods to predict the category of each hairpin and determine the similarity between the hairpins and
human miRNA. They searched for mature miRNA targets in human and SARS-CoV-2 genes, and
analyzed the potential interactions between SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs and human genes and between human
miRNAs and SARS-CoV-2 genes. Finally, the gene ontology of SARS-CoV-2 miRNA targets in human
genes was analyzed, and the PANTHER classification system was used to evaluate the similarity between
SARS-CoV-2 miRNA candidates and the mature miRNAs of any known organism [134].
In [133], Metsky et al. used genomic and AI technologies to design nucleic acid detection assays and
improve the current SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. They developed a CRISPR tool that uses enzymes to
edit the genome by cutting specific genetic code chains, and used different ML methods to predict the
diversity of the target genome. The authors designed an RT-PCR test method through the CRISPR tool,
which can effectively detect 67 respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

Drug and Vaccine Development

Based on proteomics and genomics research, a variety of drug and vaccine development programs have
been proposed for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. The application of AI in the development of new drugs
and vaccines is one of the main contributions in smart medicine, and it plays an important role in the
battle against COVID-19.

4.1

Drug Development

In the field of drug development, AI technologies can screen existing drug candidates for COVID-19 by
analyzing the interaction between existing drugs and COVID-19 protein targets. In addition, AI
technologies can also help discover new drug-like compounds against COVID-19 by constructing new
molecular structures that inhibit proteases at the molecular level. The representative AI architecture
used for new drug-like compound discover is shown in Fig. 9.

Figure 9. Representative AI architecture used for new drug-like compound discover.
Drug development can be divided into small-molecule drug discovery and biological product
development. The discovery of small-molecule drugs mainly focused on chemically synthesized small
molecule active substances, which can be made into small-molecule drugs through chemical reactions
between different organic and inorganic compounds. One group of AI-based drug development focuses on
discovering new drug-like compounds at the molecular level. In [16, 186], Beck et al. proposed a DL-based
molecule transformer-drug target interaction (MT-DTI) model to predict potential drug candidates for
COVID-19. The MT-DTI model uses the SMILES strings and amino-acid sequences to predict the target
proteins with a 3D crystal structure. The authors collected the amino-acid sequences of 3C-like proteases
and related antiviral drugs and drug targets from NCBI [52], Drug Target Common (DTC) [199], and
BindingDB [121] databases. In addition, they used a molecular docking and virtual screening tool
(AutoDock Vina [207]) to predict the binding affinity between 3,410 drugs and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.
The experimental results provided 6 potential drugs, such as Remdesivir, Atazanavir, Efavirenz,
Ritonavir, Dolutegravir, and Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir). Note that Remdesivir shows promising in
clinical trials. In [137], Moskal et al. used AI methods to analyze the molecular similarity between
anti-COVID-19 drugs (termed “parents”) and drugs involving similar indications to screen out
second-generation drugs (termed “progeny”) of COVID-19. They first used the Mol2Vec [92] method to
convert the molecular structure of the parent drugs into a high-dimensional vector space, treated the
drug molecule as a “sentence”, and mapped its molecular substructure to a “word”. Then, they used the
VAE [192] model to generate SMILES strings with 3D shape and pharmacodynamic properties to the
given seed molecule [63]. In addition, CNN, LSTM, and MLP models are used to generate the
corresponding SMILES strings and molecules. The authors selected 71 parent drugs from the literature
as seed molecules, and 4456 drugs from ZINC [246] and ChEMBL as candidate progeny drugs [55].
In [22], Bung et al. committed to the development of new chemical entities of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
based on DL technology. They constructed an RL-based RNN model to classify protease inhibitor
molecules and obtained a smaller subset that favored the chemical space. Then, they collected 2515
protease inhibitor molecules in the SMILES format from the ChEMBL database as training data, where

13/37

each SMILES string is regarded as a time series, and each position or symbol is regarded as a time point.
The output of small molecules is docked to the 3CLpro structure with minimal energy and ranked
according to the virtual screening score obtained by selecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates [207].
In [197], Tang et al. analyzed 3CLpro with a 3D structure similar to SARS-CoV, and evaluated it as an
attractive target for the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs. They proposed an advanced deep Q
learning network (called ADQN-FBDD) to generate potential lead compounds of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.
They collected 284 molecules reported as SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. An improved BRICS
algorithm [46] was used to split these molecules to obtain the target fragment library of SARS-CoV-2
3CLpro. Then, the proposed ADQN-FBDD model trains each target fragment and predicts the
corresponding molecules and lead compounds. Through the proposed Structure-Based Optimization
Policy (SBOP), they finally obtained 47 derivatives that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro from these lead
compounds, which are regarded as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.
Another group of studies focuses on screening candidate biological products of COVID-19. Biological
products are protein products with therapeutic effects, which mainly bind to specific cell receptors
involved in the disease process. Biological products are prepared from microbial cells (such as genetically
modified bacteria, yeast, or mammalian cell strains) through a biotechnology process. In [81], Hu et al.
established a multi-task DL model to predict the possible binding between potential drugs and
SARS-CoV-2 protein targets, so as to select drugs that can be used for SARS-CoV-2. They first
collected 8 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins from GHDDI [58] as potential targets. The proposed DL model is
based on the AtomNet model [194, 210] and includes a shared layer to learn the joint representation of all
tasks and a task processing layer to perform specific tasks. By fine-tuning the DL model using a
coronavirus-specific data set, the model can predict the possible binding between the drugs and the
protein targets and output the binding affinity score. Based on existing studies, RdRp, 3CLpro, and
papain-like protease have been confirmed as the three principal targets of SARS-CoV-2 [60, 148, 211].
Based on the prediction results [114, 215], the authors selected the top 10 potential drugs with a high
likelihood of inhibiting each target. In [97], Kadioglu et al. used High-Performance Computing (HPC),
virtual drug screening, molecular docking, and ML technologies to identify SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates.
After performing virtual drug screening and molecular docking, two supervised ML models(such as NN
and Naivebayes) are used to analyze clinical drugs and test compounds to construct corresponding drug
likelihood prediction models. Several approved drugs were selected as SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates,
including drugs for hepatitis C virus (HCV), enveloped ssRNA virus, and other infectious diseases.
Facing the known COVID-19 protease target 3CLpro, Zhavoronkov et al. designed a small-molecule
drug-discovery pipeline to produce 3CLpro inhibitors, and used 3CLpro’s crystal structure, homology
modelling and co-crystallized fragments to generate 3CLpro molecules [241]. They collected the crystal
structure of COVID-19 3CLpro from [232] and constructed a homology model. At the same time,
molecules activity to various proteases were extracted from [55, 90] and constituted a protease
peptidomimetic data set with 5,891 compounds. Then, they used 28 ML methods (such as GAE, GAN,
and GA) and RL strategies to separately train the input data sets (e.g., crystal structure, homology
model, and co-crystal ligands), and generated new molecular structures with a high score. In [79],
Hofmarcher et al. used the ChemAI DL model [157] based on the SmilesLSTM structure [77] to test the
resistance of the molecules to COVID-19 protease. They collected 3.6 million molecules from
ChEMBL [55], ZINC [246], and PubChem [103] databases and formed a training data set. Then, the
ChemAI model is trained on the data set in a multi-task parallel training way, where the output neurons
of the model represent the biological effects of the input molecules. The authors used the ChemAI model
to predict the inhibitory effects of these molecules on the 3CLpro and PLpro proteases of COVID-19.
These molecules have a binding, inhibitory, and toxic effect on the targets. A list of COVID-19 drug
development methods based on AI technology is provided in Table 4.

4.2

Vaccine Development

Currently, there are 3 types of COVID-19 vaccine candidates, such as whole virus vaccines, recombinant
protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines [38, 239]. AI technology has participated in the design
and development of COVID-19 vaccine. Compared with the explicit applications in other fields, AI

technology is usually used in the sub-processes of vaccine development in an implicit manner.
The AI algorithms of netMHC and netMHCpan are used to develop COVID-19 vaccines for epitope
prediction [74, 96, 219]. In [74], Herst et al. obtained the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences from GenBank
and used the MSA algorithm to trim the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein sequences into possible peptide
sequences. On this basis, they used netMHC and netMHCpan AI algorithms to train and predict peptide
sequences [8, 96]. The pan variant of netMHC integrates the in-vitro objects of 215 HLAs for prediction.
Finally, they used the average value of the ANN, SVM, netMHC and netMHCpan methods to calculate
vaccine candidates. In [219], Ward et al. downloaded the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences from
NCBI [52] and GISAID [61] databases, and generated a consensus sequence for each SARS-CoV-2
protein. The sequences can be used as references for prediction, specificity, and epitope mapping analysis.
Next, the authors used different epitope prediction tools to predict B cell epitopes and map them to the
amino acid sequences of each gene. On this basis, they used the AI-based netMHCpan algorithm to
predict HLA-1 peptides and obtained a total of 2,915 alleles in all peptide lengths. The BLASTp tool [6]
was used to map the short amino acid epitope sequences to the canonical sequences of SARS-CoV-2
proteins. Finally, the authors provided an online tool that provides functions of SARS-CoV-2 genetic
variation analysis, epitope prediction, coronavirus homology analysis, and candidate proteome analysis.
In [144], Ong et al. used ML and Reverse Vaccinology (RV) methods to predict and evaluate
potential vaccines for COVID-19. They used RV to analyze the bioinformatics of pathogen genomes to
identify promising vaccine candidates. They obtained the SARS-CoV-2 sequences and all the proteins of
six known human coronavirus strains from the NCBI [52] and UniProt [15] databases. Then, they used
Vaxign and Vaxign-ML [71, 143] to analyze the complete proteome of the coronavirus and predicted its
service biological characteristics. Next, they used LR, SVM, KNN, RF, and XGBoost methods to
improve the Vaxign-ML model, and predicted the protein levels of all SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The nsp3
protein was selected for phylogenetic analysis, and the immunogenicity of nsp3 was evaluated by
predicting T cell MHC-I and MHC-II and linear B-cell epitopes.
In [161], Qiao et al. used DL to predict the patient’s neoantigen mutation and identified the best
T-cell epitope for the peptide-based COVID-19 vaccines. They first sequenced the diseased cells in the

15/37

patient’s blood and extracted 6 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types and T-cell receptor (TCR)
sequences. Then, they proposed the DeepNovo model to train patient’s immune peptides and to identify
the best T-cell epitope set based on a person’s HLA alleles and immune peptide group information. The
DeepNovo model uses LSTM and RNN structures to capture sequence patterns in peptides or proteins,
and predicts HLA peptides from conserved regions of the virus, thereby predicting new mutant antigens
in patients. In addition, they used the IEDB tool [209] to predict the immunogenicity of 177 peptides.
They suggested designing an epitope-based COVID-19 vaccine specifically for each person based on
his/her HLA alleles.
The prediction of immune stimulation ability is an important part of vaccine design [165, 169].
Different ML methods and position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) are usually used to predict epitope
and immune interactions, thereby predicting the production of adaptive immunity in the target host.
In [165], Rahman et al. used immuno-informatics and comparative genomic methods to design a
multi-epitope peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, which combines the epitopes of S, M, and E proteins.
They used the Ellipro antibody epitope prediction tool [88] to predict linear B-cell epitopes on the S
protein. In addition, Sarkar et al. studied the epitope-based vaccine design against COVID-19 and used
the SVM method to predict the toxicity of the selected epitopes [174]. In [156], Prachar et al. used 19
epitope-HLA combination prediction tools including IEDB, ANN, and PSSM algorithms to predict and
verify 174 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.

Epidemic and Transmission Prediction

Thanks to the developed information and multimedia technology, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19
were reported timely and accurately. The number of suspected, confirmed, cured, and dead COVID-19
cases in each country/region is announced in real-time. In addition, passenger travel trajectories and
related big data are shared for scientific research. Based on a wealth of data, numerous researchers have
participated in the prediction, spread, and tracking of the COVID-19 outbreak.

5.1

Patient Mortality and Survival Rate Prediction

Researchers collected clinical COVID-19 case data and used different AI methods to extract important
features and to predict the mortality and survival rate of patients with COVID-19. The representative
AI architecture used for patient mortality and survival rate prediction is shown in Fig. 10.

Figure 10. Representative AI architecture used for patient mortality and survival rate prediction
.
In [155], Pourhomayoun et al. used 6 AI methods to predict the mortality of patients with COVID-19.
They used public data of patients with COVID-19 from 76 countries/regions around the world [227], and
counted 112 features, including 80 medical annotations and disease features and 32 features from the
patients’ demographic and physiological data. Based on the filtering method and wrapper method, 42
best features were extracted, such as demographic features, general medical information, and patient
symptoms. On this basis, 6 AI methods (such as SVM, NN, RF, DT, LR, and KNN) are used to predict
the mortality of patients with COVID-19. In [175], Sarkar et al. used the RF model to analyze the
records of 433 patients with COVID-19 from Kaggle [44], and identified the important features and their

16/37

impact on mortality. Experimental results show that patients over 62 years of age have a higher risk of
death. In [230, 231], Yan et al. analyzed a blood sample data set of 404 patients with COVID-19 in
Wuhan, China, and used the XGBoost classification method [37] to select three important biomarkers to
predict the survival rate of individual patients. Experimental results with an accuracy of 90% indicate
that higher LDH levels seem to play an important role in distinguishing the most critical COVID-19
cases.

5.2

Outbreak and Transmission Prediction

BlueDot [19] and Metabiota [132] are two AI companies that made accurate predictions for the
COVID-19 outbreak. BlueDot collected large-scale heterogeneous data from various sources, such as
news reports, global ticketing data, animal diseases, global infectious disease alerts, and real-time climate
conditions. Then, it used filtering tools to narrow its focus; used various ML and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques to detect, mark, and display the potential risk frequency of COVID-19; and
finally predicted the outbreak time of transmission. It is worth mentioning that 9 days before the official
announcement of the COVID-19 outbreak, BlueDot has accurately predicted the epidemic of COVID-19
and cities with a high risk of virus outbreaks. Metabiota collected large-scale data from social and
nonsocial sources (such as biology, socioeconomic, political, and environmental data), and used
technologies such as AI, ML, big data, and NLP to accurately predict the outbreak, spread, and
intervention measures of COVID-19. More AI-based methods used for COVID-19 outbreak and
transmission prediction are shown in Table 5.

Although the source of the COVID-19 epidemic has not yet been identified, it was first reported in
Wuhan, China. Therefore, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in China have received extensive
attention. In [84], Huang et al. used 4 DL models (such as CNN, LSTM, GRU, and MLP) to train and
predict COVID-19 cases from 7 severely epidemic cities in China. The input of these DL models are the
features of COVID-19 cases, including the number of confirmed cases, cured cases, and deaths. Based on
the input of the previous 5 days, each model can predict the number of COVID-19 cases in the following
few days. The representative AI architecture used for the COVID-19 outbreak prediction is shown in Fig.
11.
In [82, 83], Hu et al. used AI methods such as MAE and clustering algorithms to predict the number
of confirmed COVID-19 cases in different provinces and cities in China. They divided 34 provinces and
cities in China into 9 groups based on the prediction results, and further predicted the spread of
COVID-19 between provinces and cities. In [235], Yang et al. used the SEIR model [100] and the LSTM
model to predict COVID-19 in China. The population migration data and the latest COVID-19
epidemiological data from Baidu [14] were input into the SEIR model to derive the epidemic curves. In

addition, they used the 2003 SARS data to pre-train the LSTM model to predict COVID-19 in the
following few days, in which epidemiological parameters (such as the transmission, incubation, recovery
probability, and the number of deaths) were selected as input features. Both SEIR and LSTM models
predict the daily peak of infection in the first week of February will be 4,000. In [50, 51], Fong et al.
obtained early COVID-19 epidemiological data from NHC [140]. Then, they used traditional time series
data analysis methods (such as ARIMA, Exponential, and Holt-Winters), ML methods (such as KR,
SVM, and DT), and AI methods (such as PNN) to analyze and predict future outbreaks.
In addition to China, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in other countries (including the United
States, Italy, Spain, Iran, and Switzerland) have also received widespread attention. In [3], Ai et al.
proposed an improved ANFIS method [93] to predict the number of COVID-19 cases. The proposed
system connects fuzzy logic and neural networks, and uses an enhanced flower pollination algorithm [234]
for model parameter optimization and model training. In [170], Rizk et al. proposed an improved
Multi-layer Feed-forward Neural Network (ISACL-MFNN) model, which uses an internal search
algorithm (ISA) to optimize model parameters and a CL strategy to enhance ISA performance. From
the official COVID-19 data set reported by the WHO [220], data from January 22, 2020, to April 3, 2020,
in the United States, Italy, and Spain were collected to train the ISACL-MFNN model and to predict the
confirmed cases within the next 10 days. In [62], Giuliani et al. collected the number of infected people
in various provinces of Italy [145], and used the EMTMGL model to simulate and predict the spatial and
temporal distribution of COVID-19 infection in Italy. They collected daily epidemic data and saved
them in a time series data format, and then used LR and LSTM models to make predictions, thereby
obtaining the outbreak and spread trend of COVID-19 in Iran. In [129, 130], Marini et al. developed an
agent-based AI platform, which accepts the entire Swiss population as input data to simulate and predict
the spread of COVID-19 in Switzerland. It simulates people’s daily trajectories by calibrating
micro-census data, and effectively predicts individual contacts and possible transmission routes.
Many studies have likewise focus on predicting the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. They collected a
large amount of travel data, mobile phone data, and social media data, and used AI methods to
accurately predict the potential spread and transmission route of COVID-19. In [111], Lai et al.
collected a large amount of travel and mobile phone data from [222], and constructed a corresponding
model to predict the risk of COVID-19 transmission in different countries. On this basis, they
established an air travel network model between domestic cities and cities in other countries to predict
risk cities at home and abroad. In [158], Punn et al. used 2 ML models (e.g., SVR [12] and PR [45]) and
3 DL regression models (e.g., DNN, LSTM [66], and RNN) to predict real-time COVID-19 cases.
In [112], Lampos et al. used an automatic crawling tool to obtain daily confirmed COVID-19 case data
and related articles from online media, such as MediaCloud [131], Public Health England (PHE) [64],
and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [54]. They used the TL strategy to

18/37

transfer the COVID-19 model of the disease-spreading country that are still in the early stage of the
epidemic curve, achieving the epidemic prediction in the target country. In addition, companies such as
Microsoft Bing [18], Google [206], and Baidu [14] have aggregated multiple available data sources and
developed a COVID-19 global tracking system to provide a visual tracking interface.
In addition to AI methods, various methods based on statistics and epidemiology are also used to
predict the outbreak and spread of COVID-19. In [70], He et al. collected the highest viral load in the
pharyngeal swabs of 94 patients with confirmed COVID-19. They fitted a generalized additive model
with identification links and smooth spline curves to analyze their overall trend. A gamma distribution
was fitted to the transmission pair data to evaluate the serial interval distribution. The results of
statistical analysis indicated that the patients with confirmed COVID-19 have reached the peak of virus
shedding before or during symptom onset, and some kinds of transmission may occur before the initial
symptoms appear. In [213], Wang et al. determined a set of technical indicators that reflect the infection
status of COVID-19, such as the number of infection cases in the hospital, daily infection rate, and daily
cured rate. Next, they proposed a calculation method based on statistical theory to quantify the iconic
characteristics of each period and predict the turning point in the development of the epidemic. In
addition, numerous studies based on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and SEIR models have
studied the spread of COVID-19 from an epidemiological perspective. Please
see [24, 120, 171, 191, 200, 204, 236] for more information.

5.3

Social Control

When COVID-19 appeared, most countries in the world adopted different forms of social control, social
alienation, school closures, and blockade measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic [208]. AI
technologies have been widely used in epidemic control and social management, including individual
temperature detection, video tracking, contact tracking, intelligent robots, etc. Many countries have used
smart devices equipped with AI to detect suspicious persons in public transportation places, such as
airports and train stations. For example, infrared cameras are used to scan high temperatures in a
crowd, and different AI methods perform efficient analysis to detect whether an individual is wearing a
mask in real time. In addition, DL-based video tracking technology was used to detect and track
suspicious COVID-19 patients in public places [32]. Moreover, at the entrances and exits of cities, the
identity information of each passing person was collected. Then, AI-based systems are used to efficiently
query the travel history and trajectory of each passing individual to check whether they are from areas
seriously affected by COVID-19 [35, 202].
AI technology is also used for contact tracking of patients with COVID-19 [99]. For each patient with
confirmed COVID-19, personal data (such as mobile phone positioning data, consumption records, and
travel records) can be integrated to identify potential transmission trajectories [56]. In addition, when
people are in a state of social isolation, mobile phone positioning and AI frameworks can assist the
government better understand the status of individuals [168]. Intelligent robots are used to perform
on-site disinfection and product transfer, and mobile phone positioning functions are used to detect and
track the distribution and flow of personnel. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bluetooth technology was
used in contact tracing APPs and deployed in many countries [80]. Moreover, various countries/regions
such as China, Canada, Singapore, Australia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, have deployed
different contact tracing systems to effectively track public contacts and locate persons suspected of
COVID-19 [105]. For example, in China, a system of QR code was used to track the infected or
potentially infected people [108]. The Canadian government has published several Apps for COVID-19
contact tracing, such as the COVID Alert App, Canada COVID-19 self-assessment tool, and
ArriveCAN [25]. In Singapore, a real-time locating system (TraceTogether App) was developed to track
public contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic [76].
Another group of studies focuses on the impact of various social control strategies on the spread of
COVID-19. In [72], Hellewell et al. proposed a random propagation model to analyze the success rate of
different social control approaches to prevent the spread of COVID-19. By quantifying parameters such
as contact tracking and quarantined cases, the model analyzes the maximum number of cases tracked
every week and measures the feasibility of public health work. In [104], Kissler et al. established a

19/37

mathematical model to assess the impact of interventions on the prevalence of COVID-19 in the United
States, and recommended the use of intermittent grooming measures to maintain effective control of
COVID-19. Koo et al. [107] applied the population and personal behavior data of Singapore to the
influenza epidemic simulation model and assessed different social isolation strategies for the dynamic
transmission of COVID-19. Similarly, Chang et al. [28] constructed a simulation model to evaluate the
propagation and control of COVID-19 in Australia. The model analyzes the propagation characteristics
of COVID-19 and the impact of different control strategies on the propagation results.

Data and Resources

The implementation and performance improvement of AI greatly depends on a large-scale available data
and resources. Therefore, we compiled available public resources that can be used for COVID-19 disease
diagnosis, virology research, drug and vaccine development, and epidemic and transmission prediction.
Three types of data and resources are summarized, including medical images, biological data, and
informatics resources.

6.1

Medical Images

We collected 17 groups of COVID-19 medical images, such as CXR and CT images, from researchers and
organizations. Among them, the CXR image data set published by Cohen et al. [40] is widely cited. It is
a collection of CXR images from multiple references. In addition, many researchers uploaded CXR and
CT images to Kaggle [13, 113, 124, 139, 163] for COVID-19 research. Moreover, organizations such as the
British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI), Eurorad, and Radiopaedia also released online CXR and CT
images. Table 6 displays a detailed description of the medical image data resources of COVID-19.

Cough Sound Datasets

Compared with medical images and biological data, cough sound data sets that can be used for
COVID-19 analysis are very scarce. In order to promote research in this direction, we collect 8 groups of
human cough sound data sets, 5 of which contain cough sounds of patients with confirmed COVID-19, as
shown in Table 8. We hope that these data sets will facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 through cough
sounds.

Informatics Resources

Informatics resources such as COVID-19 situation reports, dashboards, COVID-19 cases, and
demographic data are gathered in Table 9. Among them, the World Health Organization (WHO), the
National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (NHC), and the Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) provide real-time COVID-19 reports. Companies such as Baidu, Microsoft Bing,
Google, and JHU CSSE provide online dashboards for COVID-19 spread tracking. Organizations such as
Govuk, Il Sole, and ECDC provide real-time COVID-19 cases in the UK, Italy, and Europe.

Challenges and Future Directions

Although AI technologies have been used in fighting against COVID-19 and many studies have been
published, we note that the application and contribution of AI in this work is still relatively limited. We

summarize the main challenges currently faced by AI against COVID-19 and provide the corresponding
suggestions.

7.1

Challenges

At present, the application of AI in COVID-19 research mainly faces 5 challenges:
• Lack of available large-scale training data. Most AI methods rely on large-scale annotated training
data, including medical images and various biological data. However, due to the rapid outbreak of
COVID-19, there is insufficient data available for AI. In addition, annotating training samples is
very time-consuming and requires professional medical personnel.
• Data imbalance between positive and negative samples. There is a serious proportional imbalance
between positive COVID-19 samples and negative samples (data resources without COVID-19).
For data sets of medical images, biology samples, and cough sounds, negative samples are relatively
easy to obtain from historical publications. However, there are limited positive COVID-19 samples
can be collected, which further affects the accuracy and robustness of AI algorithms in COVID-19
diagnosis.
• Massive noisy data and rumors. Relying on the developed mobile Internet and social media,
massive noise information and fake news about COVID-19 have been published on various online
media without rigorous review. However, AI algorithms seem to be powerless in judging and
filtering the noise and erroneous data. This problem limits the accuracy and application of AI
algorithms, especially in epidemic prediction and transmission analysis.
• Limited knowledge in the intersection of computer science and medicine. Many AI scientists are
from computer science, but the application of AI in the COVID-19 battle requires in-depth
cooperation in computer science, medical imaging, bioinformatics, virology, and many other
disciplines. Therefore, it is crucial to coordinate the cooperative work of researchers from different
fields and integrate the knowledge of multiple subjects to jointly respond to COVID-19.
• Data privacy and human rights protection. In the era of big data and AI, the cost of obtaining
personal privacy data is very low. Faced with public health issues such as COVID-19, many
governments hope to obtain various types of personal information, including mobile phone
positioning data, personal travel trajectory data, and patient disease data. How to effectively
protect personal privacy and human rights during information acquisition and AI-based processing
is an issue worthy of discussion and attention.

22/37

7.2

Future Directions

In addition to the applications investigated in this survey, AI can also contribute to the COVID-19
battle from the following 11 potential directions:
1. Non-contact disease detection. In CXR and CT image detection, the use of non-contact automatic
image acquisition can effectively avoid the risk of infection between radiologists and patients during
the COVID-19 pandemic. AI can be used for patient posture positioning, standard section
acquisition of CXR and CT images, and movement of camera equipment.
2. Few-shot learning and transfer learning. Focusing on the serious imbalance between the positive
COVID-19 samples and negative samples, few-shot Learning, meta-learning, and transfer learning
have the potential to be further applied in COVID-19 research [41, 136]. After learning a large
amount of data in a certain category, few-shot Learning algorithms can quickly detect a new
category and obtain high accuracy by learning only a small number of samples. Transfer learning
relaxes the assumption that training data must be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d)
with test data, and effectively solve the problem of insufficient training data and imbalanced
sample categories.
3. Remote video diagnosis. AI and NLP technologies can be used to develop remote video diagnosis
systems and chat robot systems, and provide the public with COVID-19 disease consultation and
preliminary diagnosis.
4. Patient prognosis management. In addition to long-term tracking and management of patients
with COVID-19, AI technology (such as intelligent image and video analysis) can also be used to
automatically monitor patient behavior during follow-up monitoring and prognostic management.
5. Biological research. In the field of biological research, AI can be used to discover the protein
structures and features of viruses by accurately analyzing biomedical information, such as
large-scale protein structures, gene sequences, and viral trajectories.
6. Drug and vaccine development. AI can be used not only to discover potential drugs and vaccines,
but also to simulate the interaction between drugs and proteins and between vaccines and
receptors, thereby predicting the potential responses of patients with COVID-19 with different
constitutions to drugs and vaccines.
7. Identification and filtering of fake news. AI can be used to reduce and eliminate fake news and
noise data on online social media platforms to provide reliable, correct, and scientific information
about the COVID-19 pandemic.
8. Impact simulation and evaluation. Various simulation models can use AI to analyze the impact of
different social control strategies on disease transmission. Then, they can be used to explore more
effective and scientific disease prevention and social control methods.
9. Patient contact tracking. By constructing social relationship networks and knowledge graphs, AI
can identify and track the trajectories of people in close contact with patients with COVID-19, so
as to accurately predict and control the potential spread of the disease.
10. Intelligent robots. Intelligent robots are expected to be used in applications such as disinfection
and cleaning in public places, product distribution, and patient care.
11. Intelligent Internet of Things. AI is expected to be combined with the Internet of Things to be
deployed in customs, airports, railway stations, bus stations, and business centers. In this case, we
can quickly identify suspicious COVID-19 virus and patients through intelligent monitoring of the
environment and personnel.

Conclusions

In this survey, we investigated the main scope and contributions of AI in combating COVID-19.
Compared with the pandemic of SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012, AI technologies have been
successfully applied to almost every corner of the COVID-19 battle. The application of AI in COVID-19
research can be summarized in four aspects, such as disease detection and diagnosis, virological research,
drug and vaccine development, and epidemic and transmission prediction. Among them, medical image
analysis, drug discovery, and epidemic prediction are the main battlefields of AI against COVID-19. We
also summarized the currently available data and resources for AI-based COVID-19 research, including
medical imaging data, biological data, and informatics resources. Finally, we highlighted the main
challenges and potential directions in this field. This survey provides medical and AI researchers with a
comprehensive view of the current and potential contributions of AI in combating COVID-19, with the
goal of inspiring them to continue to maximize the advantages of AI and big data to combat this
pandemic.
