Review

What social media told us in the time of COVID-19: a scoping
review
Shu-Feng Tsao, Helen Chen, Therese Tisseverasinghe, Yang Yang, Lianghua Li, Zahid A Butt

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has rapidly become a crucial communication tool for
information generation, dissemination, and consumption. In this scoping review, we selected and examined peerreviewed empirical studies relating to COVID-19 and social media during the first outbreak from November, 2019, to
November, 2020. From an analysis of 81 studies, we identified five overarching public health themes concerning the
role of online social media platforms and COVID-19. These themes focused on: surveying public attitudes, identifying
infodemics, assessing mental health, detecting or predicting COVID-19 cases, analysing government responses to the
pandemic, and evaluating quality of health information in prevention education videos. Furthermore, our Review
emphasises the paucity of studies on the application of machine learning on data from COVID-19-related social
media and a scarcity of studies documenting real-time surveillance that was developed with data from social media on
COVID-19. For COVID-19, social media can have a crucial role in disseminating health information and tackling
infodemics and misinformation.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), and the resulting COVID-19, is a substan­
tial international public health issue. As of Jan 18, 2021,
an estimated 95 million people worldwide had been
infected with the virus, with about 2 million deaths.1 As a
consequence of the pandemic, social media is becoming
the platform of choice for public opinions, perceptions,
and atti­
tudes towards various events or public health
policies regarding COVID-19.2 Social media has become a
pivotal communication tool for governments, organ­
isations, and universities to dissem­
inate crucial infor­
mation to the public. Numerous studies have already
used social media data to help to identify and detect
outbreaks of infectious diseases and to interpret public
attitudes, behaviours, and perceptions.3–6 Social media,
particularly Twitter, can be used to explore multiple facets
of public health research. A systematic review identified
six categories of Twitter use for health research, namely
content analysis, surveillance, engage­ment, recruitment,
as part of an intervention, and network analysis of Twitter
users.5 However, this review included only broader
research terms, such as health, medicine, or disease, by
use of Twitter data and did not focus on specific disease
topics, such as COVID-19. Another article analysed tweets
on COVID-19 and identified 12 topics that were
categorised into four main themes: the origin, source,
effects on individuals and countries, and methods of
decreasing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.7 In this study, data
were not available for tweets that were related to
COVID-19 before February, 2020, thereby missing the
initial part of the epidemic, and the data for tweets were
limited to between Feb 2 and March 15, 2020.
Social media can also be effectively used to communicate
health information to the general public during a
pandemic. Emerging infectious diseases, such as
COVID-19, almost always result in increased usage and
consumption of media of all forms by the general public
for information.8 Therefore, social media has a crucial role

in people’s perception of disease exposure, resultant
decision making, and risk behaviours.9,10 As information
on social media is generated by users, such information
can be subjective or inaccurate, and frequently includes
misinformation and conspiracy theories.11 Hence, it is
imperative that accurate and timely information is
disseminated to the general public about emerging threats,
such as SARS-CoV-2. A systematic review explored the
major approaches that were used in published research on
social media and emerging infectious diseases.12 The
review identified three major approaches: assessment of
the public’s interest in, and responses to, emerging
infectious diseases; examination of organisations’ use of
social media in communicating emerging infectious
diseases; and evaluation of the accuracy of medical
information that is related to emerging infectious diseases
on social media. However, this review did not focus on
studies that used social media data to track and predict
outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases.
Analysing and disseminating information from peerreviewed, published research can guide policy makers
and public health agencies to design interventions for
accurate and timely knowledge translation to the general
public. Therefore, keeping in view the limitations of
existing research that we have previously mentioned, we
did a scoping review with the aim of understanding the
roles that social media has had since the beginning of the
COVID-19 crisis. We investigated public attitudes and
perceptions towards COVID-19 on social media,
information about COVID-19 on social media, use of
social media for prediction and detection of COVID-19,
the effects of COVID-19 on mental health, and
government responses to COVID-19 on social media.
Our objective was to identify and analyse studies on
social media that were related to COVID-19 and focused
on five themes: infodemics, public attitudes, mental
health, detection or prediction of COVID-19 cases,
government responses to the pandemic, and quality of
health information in videos.

Methods
Overview

81 articles selected

Studies exploring the use of social media relating to
COVID-19 were reviewed by use of the scoping review
methods of Arksey and O’Malley13 and Levac and
colleagues.14 We followed the five-step scoping review
protocol and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews.

Data Sources
Exploratory searches were done on COVID-19 Open
Research Dataset Challenge and Google Scholar in
April, 2020. These searches helped to define the Review
scope, develop the research questions, and determine
eligibility criteria. After such activity, MEDLINE and
PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO were selected for this
Review because they include peer-reviewed literature in
the fields of medicine, behavioural sciences, psychology,
health-care systems, and clinical sciences. Variations of
the key search terms can be found in the panel. Since the
start of the current pandemic, COVID-19 articles were
reviewed and published at an unprecedently rapid rate,
with numerous publications that were available ahead of
print referred to as preprints or articles in press. In this
Review, we consider peer-reviewed preprints to be
equivalent to published peer-reviewed articles, and
relevant articles were screened accordingly.

Screening procedure
Mainly, the primary reviewer (S-FT) screened title and
abstract for each article to decide whether an article met
the inclusion criteria. If the criteria were confirmed,
then the article was included; otherwise, it was
excluded. Paragraphs in articles were assigned a code
representing one of the five themes (eg, I for infodemic),
then a code was assigned to the article on the basis of
2

Figure 1: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses flow chart of article extraction from the literature search

the majority of paragraph codes. Next, quotes were
sorted under each code, applying Ose’s method.15 Braun
and Clark’s thematic analysis method was used and
involved searching for the text that matched the
identified predictors (ie, codes) from the quantitative
analysis and discovering emergent codes that were
relevant to either the study objective or identified in the
relevant literature review.16 Finally, we categorised the
codes into main themes. These codes and themes were
compared and clarified by S-FT, ZAB, and YY to draw
conclusions around the main themes. S-FT is fluent in
English and Mandarin. The secondary reviewer (ZAB)
is fluent in English, and the tertiary reviewer and
domain expert (YY and HC) are both fluent in English
and Mandarin. Any discrepancies among reviewers
were discussed with the research team to reach
consensus.

Results
With the application of appropriate search filters, a total
of 2405 articles were retrieved from the identified
databases: PubMed (1084 articles), Scopus (1021 articles),
and PsycINFO (300 articles). Among these, 670 duplicates
were excluded. Of the remaining 1735 articles, 1434 were
deemed to be non-empirical, such as comments, editorial
essays, letters, opinions, and reviews. These exclusions
left 301 articles for a full-text review on the basis of the
screening results of titles and abstracts. After the full-text
review, 81 articles were included in this scoping review
(figure 1).

Mixed method: analysed
emoji use by each gender
category; the top 600 emojis
were manually classified on
the basis of their sentiment

Identified five major themes in the analysis: morbidity fears,
health concerns, employment and financial issues, praise
for front-line workers, and unique gendered emoji use;
most emojis are extremely positive across genders, but
discussions by women and gender minorities are more
negative than by men; when discussing particular topics
(eg, financial and employment matters, gratitude, and
health care), there are many differences; use of several
unique gender emojis to express specific issues (eg, coffin,
skull, and siren emojis were used more often by men than
by other genders when discussing fears and morbidity,
whereas the use of the folded hands emoji as a thankful
gesture for front-line workers was found more often in
discussions by women than by other genders and the bank
emoji was noted only in women’s discussions)

analysis

Unigram terms appear more frequently than bigram and
trigram (ie, triple words) terms; during the epidemic,
many tweets about COVID-19 were distributed and
attracted widespread public attention; high-frequency
words (eg, death, test, spread, and lockdown) indicated
that people were afraid of being infected and people who
were infected were afraid of death; people agreed to stay
at home due to fear of spread and called for physical
distancing since they became aware of COVID-19

Thematic analysis

90% (169 of 188) of tweets opposed calculated ageism,
whereas only 5% (9) supported it and 5% (10) conveyed no
position; opposition centred on moral critiques, political–
economic critiques, assertions of the worth of older adults
(eg, >60 years), and public health arguments; support
centred on individual responsibility and patriotism

the second data set was from Feb 11

Local polynomial regression;

Implicit Americanness Bias steadily decreased from
2007 to 2020; when media entities began using
stigmatising terms, such as Chinese virus, starting from
March 8, 2020, Implicit Americanness Bias began to
increase; such bias was more pronounced among
conservative individuals than among non-conservative
individuals

Sentiment analysis showed a predominantly negative
feeling towards the COVID-19 pandemic; topic modelling
revealed three themes relating to COVID-19 and the
outbreak: the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, how to
control COVID-19, and reports on COVID-19

the USA and 15 million tweets from the Philippines from
March 5 to March 19, 2020, and both countries showed a
positive relation between bot activities and rate of hate
speech in communities that are denser and more isolated
than others.43 Brennen and colleagues qualitatively
analysed 96 samples of visuals (ie, image or video) from
January to March, 2020, and categorised misinfor­mation
into six trends, noting that, fortunately, there has been no
involvement of artificial intelligence deepfake techniques
(ie, techniques used to make synthetic videos that closely
resemble real videos) so far.34

colleagues40 collected and reviewed 2102 news articles
that were circulated on the internet. Their analysis
showed that fake news was shared over 2 million times,
which accounted for 23·1% (2 352 585 of 10 184 351) of
total shares between Dec 31, 2019, and April 30, 2020.40
Similarly, another quantitative study by Galhardi and
colleagues comparing the proportion of fake news shared
on WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook in Brazil showed
that fake news was mainly shared on WhatsApp.36 A UK
study by Ahmed and colleagues analysed 22 785 tweets
posted by 11 333 Twitter users with #FilmYourHospital to
identify and evaluate the source of the conspiracy theory
on Twitter.32 Their work uncovered that ordinary people
were the major driver behind the spread of conspiracy
theories.32 Another study investigated the 5G and
COVID-19 conspiracy theory that was circulating on
Twitter with a random subsample of 233 tweets. The
content analysis showed that 34·8% (81) of tweets linked
5G and COVID-19 and 32·2% (75) condemned such
theory.33 Similar research by Bruns and colleagues
investigated 89 664 distinct Facebook posts in Australia
that were related to this conspiracy from Jan 1 to
April 12, 2020, by use of time series and network
analysis.35 The results showed that this conspiracy went
viral after March 19, 2020, with unusual coalition among
various groups on Facebook. Islam and colleagues
analysed 2311 infodemic reports that were related to
COVID-19 from Dec 31, 2019, to April 5, 2020, and
showed that misinformation was mainly driven by
rumours, stigma, and conspiracy theories that were
circulating on various social media and other online
platforms.38 Associations between infodemic and bot
activities on social media are another important research
direction. One study analysed 12 million tweets from
12

Three themes emerged under this category: public
attitudes, mental health, and detection or prediction of
COVID-19 cases. Public attitudes and mental health are
reflections regarding the public perceptions and mental
health effects of the pandemic; detection or prediction of
COVID-19 cases includes typical surveillance studies
aiming to propose ways to detect or predict COVID-19
cases.
48 selected articles gauged the attitudes and emotions
that were expressed by social media users regarding the
COVID-19 pandemic, mainly by use of content and
sentiment analysis. Twitter accounted for 33 articles
and Sina Weibo accounted for 8 articles. Public attitude
can be further divided into the following sub-themes:
public sentiment towards the COVID-19 pandemic and
interventions, stigma and racism, and ageism.
To learn about the public sentiment towards the overall
COVID-19 pandemic and its interventions, Abd-Alrazaq
and colleagues7 analysed 167 073 unique English tweets
that were divided into four categories: origin, source,
regional and global effects on people and society, and
methods to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Tweets
regarding economic loss had the highest mean number
of likes, whereas travel bans and warnings had the lowest
number of likes.7 Kwon and colleagues investigated
259 529 English tweets in the USA, using trending and
spatiotemporal analyses, and noted that tweets about
social disruptiveness had the highest number of retweets,
whereas tweets about COVID-19 interventions had the
highest number of likes.73 A content analysis of 522 Reddit
comments showed that the topic of symptoms accounted
for 27% (141) of all comments, followed by the topic of
prevention (25% [131]).74 Likewise, another content
analysis of 155 353 unique English tweets showed that
the most mentioned topic was “peril of COVID-19”.76
Additionally, a study that examined 126 049 English
tweets by use of sentiment analysis and latent
Dirichlet analysis for topic modelling showed that the
most common emotion that was mentioned was fear,
and the most common topic that was mentioned was the
economic and political effects.79 Al-Rawi and colleagues
studied emojis in over 50 million tweets and identified
five primary subjects: morbidity fears, health concerns,
employment and financial issues, praise for front-line

workers, and unique gendered emoji use.51 Samuel
and colleagues investigated 293 597 tweets with senti­
ment analysis and noted more positive emotions than
negative emotions towards the US economy reopening.86
Analysing 2 558 474 English tweets by use of clustering
and network analyses, Odlum and colleagues identified
that African Americans shared positive sentiments
and encouraged virtual discussions and prevention
behaviours.82 A study investigated gender differences in
terms of topics by analysing 3 038 026 English tweets.88
The results showed that tweets from women were more
likely to be about family, physical distancing, and health
care, whereas tweets from men were more likely to be
about sports cancellations, pandemic severity, and
politics. In Canada, Xue and colleagues analysed
1 015 874 tweets via latent Dirichlet analysis to identify
nine themes about family violence.93 In Australia,
Yigitcanlar and colleagues analysed 96 666 tweets and
identified that the public’s attitude could be captured
efficiently through social media analytics.94 One
qualitative content analysis of 30 profiles from Instagram,
Twitter, and TikTok in Brunei identified five types of
attitudes towards physical distancing: fear, responsibility,
annoyance, fun, and resistance.80 In Turkey, to show the
effects of social media on human psychology and
behaviour, Arpaci and colleagues52 used evolutionary
clustering analysis on 43 million tweets between March 22
and March 30, 2020. The study suggested that highfrequency word clusters, such as death, test, spread, and
lockdown denoted the public’s underlying fear of infection
and death from the virus, whereas terms such as stay
home and social distancing corresponded to behavioural
shifts.52 A study in Luzon, Philippines,84 in which
sentiment analysis was done by use of natural language
processing, showed that most Filipino Twitter users
expressed negative emotions towards COVID-19, and the
negative mood grew stronger over time in lockdown.84
Sentiment analysis of 107 990 English tweets uncovered
that a negative feeling towards the COVID-19 pandemic
dominated, and topic modelling showed three major
themes in people’s concerns: the COVID-19 pandemic
emergency, how to control COVID-19, and reports on
COVID-19.54 Another study analysed 373 908 Belgian
tweets and retweets, which showed that the public relied
on the EU coalition to tackle the pandemic.72 De Santis
and colleagues analysed 1 044 645 tweets to identify daily
hot topics in Italy that were related to the COVID-19
pandemic and developed a framework for prospective
research.62 One thematic analysis study of 1 920 593 Arabic
tweets in Egypt showed that negative emotions and
sadness were high in tweets showing affective
discussions, and the dominant themes included the
outbreak of the pandemic, metaphysics responses, signs
and symptoms in confirmed cases, and conspiracism.64
In Singapore, Lwin and colleagues examined
20 325 929 tweets using sentiment analysis and showed
that public emotions shifted over time: from fear to

anger and from sadness to gratefulness.77 Chang and
colleagues examined over 1·07 million Chinese texts
from various online sources in Taiwan using deductive
analysis and identified that negative sentiments mainly
came from online news with stigmatising language
linked with the COVID-19 pandemic.56 In India, one
study investigated 410 643 tweets via sentiment analysis
and latent Dirichlet analysis and showed that positive
emotions were overall substantially higher than negative
sentiments, but this observation diminished at individual
levels.61 Another study analysed 29 554 tweets from the
second lockdown (ie, April 15–May 3, 2020) and
47 672 tweets from the third lockdown (ie, May 4–May 17,
2020) via sentiment analysis uncovered positive attitudes
towards the second lockdown but negative attitudes
towards the third lockdown in India.57 One study analysed
868 posts from Reddit and noted sentiments to be
50% (434) neutral, 22% (191) positive, and
28% (243) negative in India.63 A study in South Korea
examined 43 832 unique users and their relations on
Twitter by use of content and network analyses and
showed that tweets including medical news were more
popular than tweets containing non-medical news.83 A
study from Ireland analysed 203 756 tweets through topic
modelling and identified that war was the most frequently
used frame for the pandemic.90 In the USA, Damiano
and colleagues qualitatively analysed 600 English tweets
and showed neutral sentiment across most tweets.59
Politics also had an essential role in shaping people’s
opinion.59 A study of 19 803 tweets from Democrats and
11 084 tweets from Republicans by use of random forest
in the USA showed that Democrats put more emphasis
on public health and direct aid to US workers, whereas
Republicans put more emphasis on national unity,
China, and businesses.67 Results of a study involving
various online data sources from Italy, the UK, the USA,
and Canada showed that media was the major driver of
the public’s attention, but attention decreased with
saturation of the media with news about COVID-19.66
Compared with other users, Reddit users focused more
on health, data related to new disease, and preventative
interventions. Researchers in Spain studied 22 223 tweets
by use of topic modelling and network analysis.95 They
identified eight frames and noted that the entire pandemic
could be divided into three periods: precrisis, lockdown,
and recovery periods. Using 563 079 English Reddit posts
that were related to COVID-19, Jelodar and colleagues
proposed a novel method to detect meaningful latent
topics and sentiment–comment classification.69 Samuel
and colleagues examined over 900 000 tweets to study the
accuracy of tweet classifications among logistic regression
and Naive Bayes methods.85 They identified that Naive
Bayes had 91% of accuracy compared with 74% from the
logistic regression model.85
Han and colleagues analysed 1 413 297 Sina Weibo posts
and observed that the public paid attention to information
regarding the epidemic, especially in metro areas.68 Zhao

and colleagues studied 4056 topics from the
Sina Microblog hot search list and noted that the public
emotions shifted from negative to neutral to positive over
time and that five major public concerns existed: the
situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its effects,
front-line reporting of the pandemic and the measures of
prevention and control, expert interpretation and
discussion on the source of infection, medical services
on the front line of the pandemic, and focus on the
pandemic and the search for suspected cases.96 Li and
colleagues75 did an observational infoveillance study with
a linear regression model by analysing 115 299 Sina Weibo
posts. The results showed that the number of Sina Weibo
posts positively correlated with the number of reported
cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Additionally, the qualitative
analysis classified the topics into the following
four overarching themes: cause of the virus, epidemio­
logical characteristics of COVID-19, public responses,
and others.75 Chen and colleagues examined relationships
between citizen engagement through government social
media and media richness, dialogic loop, content type,
and emotion valence.58 Citizen engagement through
government social media refers to sum of shares, likes,
and comments in this study, so the higher the sum, the
greater the citizen engagement through government
social media. Media richness quantifies how much
information that a sender transfers to a receiver via a
medium and is based on the media richness theory (ie,
“the potential information load of communication
media, emhasising the abilities of promoting shared
meaning”).101 Dialogic loop, or dialogic communication
theory, is defined as an approach that promotes a
dialogue between a speaker and audience. According to
the American Psychological Association, emotion
valence refers to “the value associated with a stimulus,
expressed on a continuum from pleasant to unpleasant
or from attractive to aversive”.100 For instance, happiness
is typically considered to be pleasant valence. Chen and
colleagues analysed 1411 posts that were related to
COVID-19 from Healthy China, an official account of the
National Health Commission of China on Sina Weibo.
Findings showed an inverse association between media
richness and citizen engagement through government
social media, indi­cating that posts with plain texts had
higher citizen engagement through government social
media than did posts with pictures or videos. A positive
association between dialogic loop and citizen engagement
through government social media was noted, as
evidenced by 96% (1355 of 1411) of responses to these
posts having hashtags and 25% (353 of 1411) containing
questions. In terms of media richness, when posts had
both a high media richness and positive emotion, citizen
engagement through government social media increased,
whereas when posts had a high media richness and
negative emotion, citizen engagement decreased.
Regarding content type, when posts were related to the
latest news about the pandemic, stronger negative
14

emotions led to increased citizen engagement through
government social media.58 Yin and colleagues65 proposed
a new multiple-information susceptible-discussingimmune model to analyse the public opinion propagation
of COVID-19 from Sina Weibo posts that were collected
from Dec 31, 2019, to Feb 27, 2020. The researchers
reported that the reprod­
uction rate of this proposed
model reached 1·78 in the early stage of COVID-19 but
decreased to around 0·97 and was maintained at this
level. Such a result showed that the information on
COVID-19 would continue to increase slowly in the
future until it stabilises. However, this stability would
depend on how much information is received
on COVID-19. Wang and colleagues89 analysed
999 978 randomly selected Sina Weibo posts that were
related to COVID-19 through an unsupervised
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Trans­
formers model for sentiments and a term frequencyinverse document frequency model for topic modelling.
The authors identified four public concerns: the virus
origin, symptom, production activity, and public health
control in China.89 Xi and colleagues examined 241 topics
with their views and comments via thematic and
temporal analysis and noted that older adults contributing
to the community was the most frequent theme in the
first phase of COVID-19 in China (ie, Jan 20–Feb 20, 2020).91
The theme of older patients in hospitals was most
frequent in the second (ie, Feb 21–March 17, 2020) and
third phase (ie, March 18–April 28, 2020). Using Wilcoxon
tests, Su and colleagues examined posts from
850 Sina Weibo users and 14 269 tweets from Italy.87 The
findings showed that Italian people paid more attention
to leisure, whereas Chinese people paid more attention
to the community, religion, and emotions after
lockdowns. Analysing the top 200 accounts from WeChat
via regressions and content analysis, Ma and colleagues
showed that both non-medical and medical reports had
positive effects on people’s behaviours.78 Using
Kendall’s Tau-B rank test, Xie and colleagues investigated
relations among the Baidu Attention Index, daily
Google Trends, and numbers of COVID-19 cases and
deaths.92 Daily Google Trends were correlated to seven
indicators, whereas daily Baidu Search Index was
correlated only to three indicators.92 Zhu and colleagues
analysed 1 858 288 Sina Weibo posts and noted that topics
changed over time but political and economic posts
attracted greater attention than did other topics.97
Regarding stigma and racism, Kim71 analysed
27 849 individual tweets in South Korea by use of a binary
logistic regression to gauge network size and semantic
network analysis to capture contextual and subjective
factors. The results indicated that size of personal social
network was inversely correlated with impolite language
use. Namely, users with larger social networks were less
likely to post uncivil messages on Twitter than were users
with smaller social networks. This study suggested that
the size of the social network influenced the language

choice of social media users in their postings.71 Research
compared public stigma before and after the introduction
of the terms Chinese virus or China virus in 16 535 English
tweets from before introduction and 177 327 tweets
from after introduction.55 The results showed an almost
10 times increase, nationwide and statewide and in
the USA, from 0·38 tweets posted per 10 000 people
referencing the two terms before introduction to
4·08 tweets posted per 10 000 after introduction. A similar
study examined 339 063 tweets from non-Asian respon­
dents via local polynomial regression and interrupted
time-series analysis.60 The findings showed that, when
stigmatising terms, such as Chinese virus, were used by
media (starting from March 8, 2020), the bias index (ie,
Implicit Americanness Bias) began to increase, and such
bias was more profound in conservatives than in members
of any other political subgroup. Nguyen and colleagues
analysed 3 377 295 tweets that were related to race in
the USA using sentiment analysis and uncovered a
68·4% increase in negative tweets referring to Asian
people, whereas tweets referring to other races remained
stable.81
Regarding ageism, a study70 investigating Twitter
content that was related to both COVID-19 and older
adults analysed a random sample of 351 English tweets.
21·1% (74) of the tweets implied diminished regard for
older adults by downplaying or dismissing concerns over
the high fatality of COVID-19 in this population.70 Similar
research examined 188 tweets via thematic analysis and
showed that 90% (169) of tweets opposed ageism,
whereas 5% (9) of tweets favoured ageism, and 5% (10) of
tweets were neutral.53
Two of 81 reviewed studies, both based in China,
focused on assessing the mental health of social
media users.44,45 A cross-sectional study44 investigated the
relationship between anxiety and social media exposure,
which is theoretically defined as “the extent to which
audience members have encountered specific
messages”.102 The researchers distributed an online
survey based on the Chinese version of WHO-Five WellBeing Index for depression and the Chinese version of
Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale for anxiety.
Respondents included 4872 Chinese citizens aged
18 years and older from 31 provinces and autonomous
regions in China. After controlling for all covariates
through a multivariable logistic regression, the study
showed that frequent social media exposure increased
the odds ratio of anxiety, showing that frequent social
media exposure is potentially contributing to mental
health problems during the COVID-19 outbreak.44 To
explore how people’s mental health was influenced by
COVID-19, Li and colleagues45 analysed posts from
17 865 active Sina Weibo users to compare sentiments
before and after declaration of COVID-19 outbreak by
the National Health Commission in China on
Jan 20, 2020. The researchers identified increased
negative sentiments, including anxiety, depression, and

indignation, after the declaration and decreased positive
sentiments expressed in the Oxford happiness score.
Additionally, cognitive indicators showed increased
sensitivity to social risks but decreased life satisfaction
after the declaration.45
Six of 81 studies investigated the detection or prediction
of COVID-19 outbreaks with social media data. Qin and
colleagues22 attempted to predict the number of newly
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases by collecting
social media search indexes for symptoms (eg, dry cough,
fever, and chest distress), coronavirus, and pneumonia.
The data were analysed by use of subset selection,
forward selection, lasso regression, ridge regression, and
elastic net. Results showed that the optimal model was
constructed via the subset selection. The lagged social
media search indexes were a predictor of new suspected
COVID-19 cases and could be detected 6–9 days before
confirmation of new cases.22 To evaluate the possibility of
early prediction of COVID-19 cases via internet searches
and social media data, Li and colleagues17 used the
keywords coronavirus and pneumonia to retrieve corres­
ponding trend data from Google Trends, Baidu Search
Index, and Sina Weibo Index. By use of the lag correlation,
the results showed that the correlation between trend
data with the keyword coronavirus and number of
laboratory-confirmed cases was highest 8–12 days before
increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases in the three
platforms. Similarly, the correlation between trend data
for the keyword coronavirus and new suspected
COVID-19 cases was highest 6–8 days before increase in
new suspected cases. The correlation between trend data
for the keyword pneumonia and new suspected cases
was highest 8–10 days before increase in new suspected
COVID-19 cases across the three platforms.17 Peng and
colleagues studied 1200 Sina Weibo records using
spatiotemporal analysis, kernel density analysis, and
ordinary least square regression and noted that scattered
infection, community spread, and full-scale outbreak
were three phases of early COVID-19 transmission in
Wuhan, China.21 Older people are at high risk of severe
COVID-19 and accounted for over 50% of help seeking
on Sina Weibo. To identify COVID-19 patients with poor
prognosis, Liu and colleagues analysed Sina Weibo
messages from 599 patients along with telephone followups.18 The findings suggested risk factors involving older
age, diffuse distribution of pneumonia, and hypoxaemia.
A regression study analysed Google Trends searches,
Wikipedia page views, and tweets and showed that
current Wikipedia page views, tweets from a week before,
and Google Trends searches from two weeks before can
be used to model the number of COVID-19 cases. To
model the number of deaths, all three variables should
be one week earlier than for cases.19

spread accurate information on social media because
social media has had an increasingly important role
in policy announcement and health education. Six of
81 articles were categorised as government responses
because they examined how government messages and
health education material were generated and consumed
on social media platforms. Two studies analysed data
from Sina Weibo,23,27 and the other four studies analysed
data from Twitter.28–31
Zhu and colleagues23 measured the attention of Chinese
netizens—ie, citizen of the net—to COVID-19 by
analysing 1101 Sina Weibo posts. They noted that Chinese
netizens paid little attention to the disease until the
Chinese Government acknowledged and declared the
COVID-19 outbreak on Jan 20, 2020. Since then, high
levels of social media traffic occurred when Wuhan,
China, began its quarantine (Jan 23–Jan 24, 2020), during
a Red Cross Society of China scandal (Feb 1, 2020), and
following the death of Li Wenliang (Feb 6–Feb 7, 2020).23
Li and colleagues27 collected 36 746 Sina Weibo posts to
identify and categorise the situational information using
support vector machines, Naive Bayes, and random forest
as well as features in predicting the number of reports
using linear regression. Except for posts that were
categorised as counter rumours (ie, used to oppose
rumours), they identified that the higher the word count,
the more reposts there were. Likewise, posts from
unverified users had more reposts for all categories than
did posts from verified users, excluding the counter
rumours. For counter rumours, reposts increased with
the number of followers and if the followers were from
urban areas.27 A qualitative content analysis was done to
investigate how G7 leaders used Twitter for matters
concerning the COVID-19 pandemic by collecting
203 tweets.29 The findings showed that 166 of 203 tweets
were informative, 48 tweets were linked to official
government resources, 19 (9·4%) tweets were moraleboosting, and 14 (6·9%) tweets were political.29 To assess
the political partisan polarisation in Canada regarding
COVID-19, Merkley and colleagues28 randomly sampled
1260 tweets from the social media of 292 federal members
of parliament and collected 87 Google Trends for the
search term coronavirus. 2499 Canadian respondents
aged 18 years and above were also surveyed. The results
showed that, regardless of party affiliation, members of
parliament emphasised the importance of measures for
physical distancing and proper hand-hygiene practices to
cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, without tweets
exaggerating concerns or misinformation about
COVID-19. Search interest in COVID-19 among munici­
palities was strongly determined by socioeconomic and
urban factors rather than Conservative Party vote share.28
Sutton and colleagues studied 149 335 tweets from public
health, emergency management, and elected officials and
observed that the underlying emotion of messages
changed positively and negatively over time.30 Wang and
colleagues investigated 13 598 tweets that were related to
16

COVID-19 via temporal and network analyses.31 They
categorised 16 types of messages and identified
inconsistent and incongruent messages expressed in
four crucial pre­
vention topics: mask wearing, risk
assessments, stay at home order, and disinfectants or
sanitisers.
Eight chosen studies investigated the quality (ie, the
number of recommended prevention behaviours that
were covered in the videos—eg, wearing a facemask,
washing hands, physical distancing, etc) of YouTube
videos with COVID-19 prevention information. Basch
and colleagues24 did a cross-sectional study and retrieved
the top 100 YouTube videos with the most views that
were uploaded in January, 2020, with the keyword of
coronavirus in English, with English subtitles, or in
Spanish. These 100 videos generated over 125 million
views in total. However, fewer than 33 videos included
any of the seven key prevention behaviours that are
recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.24 A follow-up study with the same criteria
and a successive sampling design gathered the top
100 YouTube videos that were most viewed in January and
March, 2020.25 Findings showed that, in total, the January
sample generated over 125 million views, and the March
sample had over 355 million views. Yet, fewer than
50 videos in either sample contained any of the preven­
tion behaviours that are recommended by the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.25 Additionally, a
study investigated the top 100 YouTube videos about do it
yourself hand sanitiser with the most views and showed
that the average number of daily calls about paediatric
poisoning increased substantially in March, 2020,
compared with the previous 2 years.46
To analyse the information quality on YouTube about
the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare the contents in
English and Chinese Mandarin videos, Khatri and
colleagues26 collected 150 videos with the keywords
2019 novel coronavirus and Wuhan virus in English and
Mandarin. The DISCERN score and the medical
information and content index were calculated as a
reliable way to measure the quality of health information.
The mean DISCERN score for reliability was low:
3·12 of 5·00 for English videos and 3·25 for Mandarin
videos. The mean cumulative medical information and
content index score of useful videos was also undesirable:
6·71 of 25·00 for English videos and 6·28 for Mandarin
videos.26 In Spain, a similar study of 129 videos in Spanish
identified that information in videos about preventing
COVID-19 was usually incomplete and differed according
to the type of authorship (ie, mass media, health
professionals, individual users, and others).47 Likewise,
one study in South Korea noted that misleading videos
accounted for 37·14% (39 of 105) of most-viewed videos
and had more likes, fewer comments, and longer viewing
times than did useful videos.48 Two studies in Turkey
investigated the quality of YouTube videos regarding
COVID-19 information in dentistry.49,50 One of these

studies analysed the top 116 English videos with at least
300 views and showed moderate quality and useful
information from these videos.49 The other study,
however, showed poor quality for 24 of 55 (43·6%)
English videos, whereas good quality accounted for only
2 (3·6%) videos.50

Discussion
Studies on social media data showed our attitudes and
mental state to some extent during the COVID-19 crisis.
These studies also showed how we generated, consumed,
and propagated information on social media platforms
when facing the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and
extraordinary measures for the containment. In our
Review, public attitudes accounted for nearly 59% (48 of
81) of the reviewed articles. In terms of social media
platforms, 56% (45 of 81) of the chosen articles used data
from Twitter, followed by Sina Weibo (20% [16 of 81]).
Machine learning analyses, such as latent Dirichlet
analysis and random forest, were applied in research that
studied public attitudes.
We identified six themes on the basis of our modified
SPHERE framework, including infodemics, public atti­
tudes, mental health, detection or prediction of COVID-19
cases, government responses to the pandemic, and quality
of prevention education videos. However, a common
limitation in all chosen studies on social media data is the
comparison of data due to differences in quality, such as
formats, metrics, or even the definition of common
variables (eg, the amount of time required for a post to be
on an individuals screen to be counted as a view). For
instance, the definition of a view on one social media
platform is likely to be different from another. Besides,
not every social media platform offers accessible data, like
Twitter and Sina Weibo. To address these challenges, the
selected studies have controlled for many factors,
including social media platforms, languages, locations,
time, misspellings, keywords, or hashtags. However, such
search strategies resulted in many study limitations, such
as non-representative sample sizes, selection bias, crosssectional study design, or retrospective study design. We
also observed that, given the large amount of available
data, most studies across all domains sampled small data
size for analyses, except for four studies under the theme
of public attitudes that analysed over one million posts via
machine learning methods. Additionally, data from
Twitter and Sina Weibo accounted for over 70% (59 of 81)
of our selected studies. Research examining other social
media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok,
Snapchat, and WhatsApp, is scarce due to barriers of data
availability and accessibility. We also identified future
research topics that are needed for each category during
the COVID-19 pandemic. From an infodemics perspective,
additional research is needed to investigate how
misinformation, rumours, and fake news (eg, anti-mask
wearing reports) undermine preventions and compromise
public health, although social media companies, such as

Twitter and Facebook, have started to remove accounts
that are based on misinformation. Bot posts are another
topic to be addressed and studies evaluating effective
counter-infodemic interventions are also needed.
Articles regarding public attitudes towards the COVID-19
pandemic have shown sentiments that shifted over time.
Yet, this theme can be a useful indicator when evaluating
interventions, such as physical distancing and wearing
masks, that aim to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection.
However, public sentiments had not been incorporated
into many intervention studies by the time that we did
this Review. When a disease, such as COVID-19, starts
spreading and causing negative sentiments, timely, proper,
and effective risk communication is needed to help ease
people’s anxiety or negative attitudes regarding the
COVID-19 pandemic, especially through social media.
Mental health is another issue that requires further
investigation. Our chosen studies did not address mental
health issues on the basis of age, as symptoms and inter­
ventions tend to vary with age. Public health measures,
such as physical distancing, that were implemented in the
COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated risk factors and adverse
health behaviours at the individual and population levels.
Studies showed that social media data were useful to detect
mental health issues at the population level. Due to the
early outbreak of COVID-19 and the prevalence of social
media use (eg, Sina Weibo and WeChat) in China, two
studies reported increased issues of mental health among
the Chinese population.44,45 A similar trend of deteriorating
mental health could happen in other regions. At the time
of writing, British Columbia has recorded the highest
number of overdose deaths in Canada (May, 2020).103
In terms of the surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic,
six chosen studies showed methods to detect or predict
the number of COVID-19 cases by use of social media
data. Accoridng to our Review, unlike other infectious
diseases, such as influenza and malaria, COVID-19 has
not had real-time monitoring surveillance developed
with social media data. It is possible that the pandemic
has evolved so rapidly that finding COVID-19 vaccinations
or therapies has been prioritised over real-time
monitoring surveillance with social media. Besides,
scarcity of accurate and reliable data sources might
discourage the development of the COVID-19 real-time
surveillance. Moreover, whether COVID-19 is a one-time
event or will become seasonal, like influenza, is
unknown. If COVID-19 becomes seasonal, then it might
be meaningful and useful to establish a real-time model
to monitor the disease by use of social media data.
Government responses that were distributed via social
media have been increasingly crucial in combating
infodemics and promoting accurate and reliable
information for the public. However, little has been
studied about how efficient and effective these official
responses are at leading to public belief or behavioural
changes. It also remained unknown whether govern­
ment posts would reach greater numbers of social

media users or have greater effects on them than would
infodemics.
YouTube has served as one of the major platforms to
spread information concerning the control of COVID-19.
Nonetheless, our chosen studies showed that most
YouTube videos were of undesirable quality because they
contained few recommended preventions from govern­
ments or public health organisations. The undesirable
quality is a worrisome observation if accurate and reliable
videos and other types of information are not created and
disseminated in a timely manner. Therefore, videos,
especially from public health authorities, should include
accurate and reliable medical and scientific information
and use relevant hashtags to reach a large audience,
generate a high number of views, and increase responses.
Moreover, our selected studies were limited to YouTube
videos only. Additionally, a substantial proportion of the
studies were done using Sina Weibo, which, although used
by many people, is exclusive to China and might lead to an
over-representation of a single country in this Review.
In summary, although our Review has limitations that
are embedded from the chosen studies, we recognised
six themes that have been studied so far and identified
future research directions. Our adopted framework can
serve as a fundamental and flexible guideline when
studying social media and epidemiology.

Conclusion
Our Review identified various topics, themes, and
methodological approaches in studies on social media
and COVID-19. Among the six identified themes, public
attitudes comprised most of the articles. Among the
selected studies, Twitter was the leading social media
platform, followed by Sina Weibo. Few studies included
Search strategy and selection criteria
The search strategies used index terms, where applicable, and free-text terms to capture
two concepts: social media, including both general terms and specific platform names
(eg, Twitter, Facebook, Sina Weibo, and YouTube); and COVID-19. For each database, both
indexed terms (ie, MeSH and Emtree) and natural language keywords were used with
Boolean operators (ie, AND, OR, and NOT) and truncations (panel). Since each database
has distinctive search functionality, individually tailored search statements were developed
with appropriate search filters for each database. Final search statements, along with a list
of search results, were downloaded from each database. Articles were included if they
discussed the use of social media for COVID-19 research and if they were original, empirical
studies. Only peer-reviewed articles, including peer-reviewed preprints, in English or
Mandarin, were included. A decision to include Chinese publications was based on the fact
that COVID-19 cases were first reported in Wuhan, China, and many initial and relevant
studies were published in Mandarin; therefore, we wanted to capture most studies
regarding the use of social media for COVID-19 research. All articles published between
Nov 1, 2019, and Nov 4, 2020, were included. Publications such as reviews, opinion pieces,
books, book chapters, articles and preprints that were not peer-reviewed, and articles that
were written in languages other than English or Mandarin were automatically excluded.
The final reference list was generated on the basis of originality and relevance to the broad
scope of this review.

machine learning methods, whereas most studies used
traditional statistical methods. Unlike influenza, we were
not able to find studies documenting real-time surveillance
that was developed with social media data on COVID-19.
Our Review also identified studies that were related to
COVID-19 on infodemics, mental health, and prediction.
For COVID-19, accurate and reliable information through
social media platforms can have a crucial role in tackling
infodemics, misinformation, and rumours. Additionally,
real-time surveillance from social media about COVID-19
can be an important tool in the armamentarium of
interventions by public health agencies and organisations.
