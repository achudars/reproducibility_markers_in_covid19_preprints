Abstract. A major focus of debate about rationing guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines is
whether and how to prioritize access for minority populations that have been particularly
affected by the pandemic, and been the subject of historical and structural disadvantage,
particularly Black and Indigenous individuals. We simulate the 2018 CDC Vaccine Allocation
guidelines using data from the American Community Survey under different assumptions on
total vaccine supply. Black and Indigenous individuals combined receive a higher share of
vaccines compared to their population share for all assumptions on total vaccine supply.
However, their vaccine share under the 2018 CDC guidelines is considerably lower than their
share of COVID-19 deaths and age-adjusted deaths. We then simulate one method to
incorporate disadvantage in vaccine allocation via a reserve system. In a reserve system, units
are placed into categories and units reserved for a category give preferential treatment to
individuals from that category. Using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) as a proxy for
disadvantage, we show that a 40% high-ADI reserve increases the number of vaccines allocated
to Black or Indigenous individuals, with a share that approaches their COVID-19 death share
when there are about 75 million units. Our findings illustrate that whether an allocation is
equitable depends crucially on the benchmark and highlight the importance of considering the
expected distribution of outcomes from implementing vaccine allocation guidelines.

I. Introduction
There is widespread evidence that the burden in terms of unemployment, hospitalizations, and
deaths due to COVID-19 is disproportionately higher in minority populations, particularly Black
communities, as well as American Indian or Alaska Natives (hereafter, “Indigenous”) (see, e.g.,
Tai, et al. 2020). Current estimates are that Blacks are dying at 2.4 times the rate of whites and
Indigenous are dying at 1.5 times the rate of Whites (Covidtracking 2020).
This reality has led many to argue that the hardest-hit racial and ethnic groups should receive
priority access to COVID-19 vaccines. For example, Melinda Gates, a prominent funder of
vaccine development efforts, has suggested that after health care workers, “Black people [should
be] next, and many other people of color” (Ducharme 2020). Likewise, Schmidt (2020)
articulates reasons why rationing approaches should give priority to groups that have been
structurally and historically disadvantaged.
Others have argued that a rationing policy that prioritizes disadvantaged groups would be
inefficient and unfair. In public comments to the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine (NASEM) Committee on Vaccine Allocation, Dr. Marc Lipsitch raised the
possibility that if herd immunity develops in disadvantaged communities due to higher
incidence, then these patients may be immune and therefore would not need prioritized vaccines
(Lipsitch 2020). There is also the concern that without public trust in a vaccine, disadvantaged
communities may believe they are being used as ‘guinea pigs’ if given priority (Toner et al.
2020). Some question whether allocation based on race or ethnicity would be legal or equitable
and undermine broader trust in the health system (see, e.g., McCaughey 2020, Twohey 2020).
Furthermore, the ACIP COVID-19 Working Group does not consider race or ethnicity in their
August 26, 2020 interim framework for COVID-19 vaccine allocation (Dooling 2020). A draft
report on equitable vaccine allocation by NASEM published on September 2, 2020 emphasized
that the allocation framework had to be sensitive to the disproportionate impact on minority
populations. Instead of directly using race or ethnicity as a criterion for allocation, the report
proposed to allocate within each of the subgroups of populations in four priority tiers by their
level of deprivation, as captured in the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (however, race and
ethnicity are included in the 15 criteria in this index). Guidance issued to states by the CDC in
the week prior to the publication of the NASEM report recommends drawing on ACIP and
NASEM’s eventual conclusions, but also encourages that in identifying priority populations,
planners should consider “people from racial and ethnic minority populations” as one of several
subgroups at increased risk for severe illness (Kaplan, Wu, and Thomas 2020).
The issue of prioritizing racial and ethnic minority populations raises two important questions.
First, under existing guidelines, do minority communities receive a fair share of vaccines
(however “fair” is operationalized)? Second, how would one implement a priority for racial and
ethnic minority populations in practice?
This paper examines the allocation of vaccines to disadvantaged communities and across US
states under the 2018 CDC Influenza Vaccine Allocation guidelines. We focus on these

2

guidelines since, at the time of writing, all proposed allocation frameworks by ACIP, NASEM,
and the CDC are in considerable flux. The 2018 CDC Vaccine guidelines underwent
comprehensive consultation and review, and as such are an important precedent and benchmark
for on-going discussions about allocation of a COVID-19 Vaccine (Cohen 2020, Splete 2020).
While a comprehensive analysis of the impact on minorities would, of course, require
considering all types, including ethnic subtypes, given the complexity of the issue at hand and
our overall goals, we focus the discussion here on allocations to Black (both Hispanic and nonHispanic) and Indigenous populations relative to white ones (both Hispanic and non-Hispanic),
by reference to the respective population size, COVID-19 related deaths, and age-adjusted deaths
using data from the American Community Survey. For ease of illustration, throughout, we
combine data for Black and Indigenous groups. We then consider a suggestion by Schmidt
(2020) to use the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), an index made available by Kind and
Buckingham (2018), which ranks neighborhoods by socioeconomic status disadvantage, as part
of the allocation system. To implement priority for hardest-hit groups, we use a reserve system
proposed by Pathak, Sönmez, Ünver, and Yenmez (2020a,b). For pragmatic reasons, we
simulate by how much a 20% and 40% high-ADI reserve with a gradient cut-off as described
below, would change vaccine access for Black and Indigenous individuals and how an ADI
reserve would influence distribution across states.
II. The 2018 CDC Influenza Vaccine Guidelines
In 2018, CDC guidelines place patients into five tiers based on occupation and demographic
factors indicating risk for contracting or spreading influenza. Table 1, from the CDC guidelines,
contains the definitions of the tiers. Tier 1 includes essential occupational groups and high-risk
populations such as pregnant women and infants and toddlers. Individuals are placed in Tiers 24 based on the occupational groups and risk status, shown in the table. Tier 5 is the largest
group, consisting of healthy adults between 19-64 years old. If there are not enough vaccines for
those in the first tier, the first tier is further portioned into seven ranked sub-tiers. For each of
Tiers 2-5, all those in the same tier have equal priority.
To estimate the number of patients in each tier, we need information on the joint distribution of
all individual characteristics used to identify the tier in which an individual belongs. As far as
know, such data do not exist. We therefore use the American Community Survey (ACS) 20142018 5-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) to identify patients eligible for each tier. We
combine this with information from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) data to identify information on high-risk conditions.
For many of the CDC’s occupation-based groups, the PUMS data does not have adequate detail
to definitively identify an individual as a member of the group. For example, one of the CDC’s
groups consists of manufacturing staff of pandemic vaccine and antiviral drugs. The PUMS data
identifies those working in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, but provides no
additional detail. Our approach in such a situation is to construct a superset of the group (such as
all those working in pharmaceutical manufacturing) and then randomly and independently assign
each observation in the superset to the group with a fixed probability for the group. The fixed
probability is calibrated so that the number of people in the US population represented by the

3

observations assigned to the group is approximately equal to the number of people in the group
as confirmed or estimated from a secondary source.
The PUMS data does not contain information on the health characteristics of surveyed
individuals. We define an individual as high risk if they have a comorbidity such as cancer,
kidney disease, heart disease, diabetes, or high BMI in the BFRSS. We then group the BRFSS
data by age bin, sex, race, and for each combination, we compute the proportion of the
population that is high-risk. Then we return to the PUMS data, and each individual is assigned to
the “high risk” category with the probability relevant to their group in the BRFSS.
Finally, we must impute an ADI score for each individual. We cannot assign the actual ADI of
each person in the PUMS data because ADI is computed using census block level averages and
the PUMS geographic specificity is only at the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) level. Singh
(2003) reports the 17 components and their coefficients used to determine the census tract level
ADI in 1990. We use these coefficients to find ADI at the household level. Each coefficient is
assigned a weight for the household using PUMS data at the household level. The weighted sum
of coefficients gives the raw numerical ADI score of the household. Since PUMS links
households to individuals, we assign these scores to each individual of the household in PUMS.
We divide the distribution in deciles and assign each decile scores 1 to 10.
We are mindful that there are several limitations to our simulation because of data constraints.
The most important limitation stem from certain data omissions in PUMS data and the fact that
we compute ADI at the family level rather than the census block level. We omit 8 million people
living in group quarters such as prisons, nursing facilities, and college and university housing as
most PUMS variables do not exist for them and they are automatically excluded from the highADI group.8 Some missing variables for people living in household setting are assumed to be 0.
The Appendix provides more detail on our methodology.
III. Vaccine Allocation under 2018 CDC guidelines
Figure 1 reports the proportion of vaccines allocated to Black and Indigenous populations
(combined) as we vary the total doses of vaccines under the 2018 CDC guidelines assuming a
single type of vaccine. The five tiers are demarcated as the number of vaccines increases. We
estimate that there are just under 25 million individuals in Tier 1.9 Figure 1 shows that after
allocating these 25 million units, about 18% of vaccines will be allocated to Black and
Indigenous recipients in Tier 2. The proportion of vaccines allocated plateaus at 18%, until it
converges to the population fraction Black and Indigenous at which point there are enough
vaccines to accommodate the entire US population of about 325 million.

8

ADI computed at the census block level also omits computing an ADI for census blocks with more than 33% of the
population living in group quarters.
9
The CDC guidelines estimate about 26 million individuals are in Tier 1. We find 25 million in Tier 1 because of a
difference in the count of pregnant women. The CDC guidelines estimate 4 million pregnant women in the United
States. Our estimate using the ACS is the number of people who gave birth in the last year multiplied by the length
of a pregnancy as a fraction of a year results in 3 million.

We report three benchmarks for comparison in the Figure: the population fraction of Black and
Indigenous groups, the fraction of COVID-related deaths among Black and Indigenous
populations, and the age-adjusted fraction of COVID deaths among them. Data on death rates
and age-adjusted death rates come from APM Research Lab’s Color of Coronavirus database,
and are as of August 5, 2020. Figure 1 shows that while 15.5% of the US population is Black or
Indigenous, the two groups account for 24.6% of COVID deaths and 28.7% of COVID ageadjusted death.
The proportion of vaccines allocated to Black and Indigenous recipients is above their population
share, but well below their share of COVID deaths or age-adjusted deaths. Therefore, when
judged compared to their population share, Black and Indigenous individuals receive a larger
share of doses for all scenarios on vaccine supply. However, this comparison by itself does not
settle the question of whether the allocation is fair, and rather, draws attention to the justification
of the reference point. When compared to the share of COVID deaths or age-adjusted deaths, the
proportion of vaccines allocated to Black and Indigenous recipients is well below these
benchmarks. If there are 100 million units of a vaccine, under the CDC guidelines, about 17.5%
units would go to Black and Indigenous individuals, while they represent 28.7% of COVID ageadjusted deaths. As a result, whether an allocation is judged to be fair depends crucially on the
benchmark used for comparisons.
Figure 2 reports on the share of vaccines allocated to each state under the 2018 CDC guidelines
for two scenarios on vaccine supply: 20 million and 50 million total vaccines. At 20 million
units, the CDC priority system would allocate units partway through Tier 1, while at 50 million
units the CDC priority system would allocate units partway through Tier 3. For each assumption
on the total number of vaccines, the Figure shows the state share of vaccines compared to three
benchmarks: the state population share, the state case share, and the state death share. For each
normalization, a value of one means that the state share of vaccines is equal to the population
share, case share or death share. A value greater than one means that the state obtains a greater
share of vaccines relative to the benchmark, while a value less than one means the state obtains a
smaller share relative to the benchmark.
The top panel of Figure 2 shows that relative to population, states like California, Florida, and
Michigan, receive a smaller share of vaccines relative to their population. This remains true
when the number of vaccines increases to 50 million units. At 50 million units, several
northeastern states receive a ratio less than one, while their ratio was greater than one at 20
million units. For example, at 20 million units, Massachusetts’s share of vaccines is 1.02, while
at 50 million units, its share is 0.94.
The second panel of Figure 2 shows that relative to the state case share, southern states receive
much less than their proportionate share, while mountain and midwestern states receive more
than their proportionate share. The comparison relative to state population share in the top panel
did not indicate major differences between these states. For example, Louisiana’s share of
vaccines relative to its share of cases is 0.59 at 20 million units and 0.58 at 50 million units.
Relative to state population, Louisiana is at 1.06 and 1.04, respectively. Montana’s share of
vaccines relative to case share is over 3 at both levels of vaccine supply, but it is close to one
when judged by population share. For the state case share benchmark, there is relatively little

5

difference across states as vaccine supply increases. This can be seen by comparing the colors
across the two scenarios in the second panel of Figure 2.
The third panel of Figure 2 shows that relative to the share of deaths in the state, northeastern
states receives less than their share of deaths, while southeastern states receive more than their
share of deaths. New Jersey and New York stand out under both the 20 and 50 million scenarios
as receiving the least compared to the share of deaths. Large states like California and Texas
receive more than their share of vaccines relative to share of deaths.
The variation across these three metrics illustrates that how an equitable allocation is defined
matters a great deal for regional comparisons.
IV. Prioritizing the Hardest-Hit in the 2018 CDC system
A. How to Prioritize?
There is no explicit consideration for prioritizing hardest-hit groups in the 2018 CDC vaccine
allocation system. Pathak, et. al (2020a,b) illustrate that despite widespread consensus on the
desirability of incorporating multiple ethical criteria into an allocation system, many medical
rationing guidelines struggle to do so because they employ a priority system. If hardest-hit
individuals receive heightened priority, there is a potential that all units will go to the group with
heightened priority, leaving no units available for the rest of society. For example, this is a
major challenge in formulating guidelines of rationing ventilators during influenza pandemics,
with some states like New York and Minnesota abandoning priority for essential personnel, and
a few states like Michigan adopting essential personnel priority. Several other states are vague
about implementation (see Pathak et. al. 2020b for details).
Imprecision on vaccine allocation is a major hurdle for public acceptance of any rationing
scheme. The inability to accommodate various desirable ethical goals may be a consequence of
the mechanical structure of a priority system that allocates all units using the same priority order
of individuals. A more flexible alternative is a reserve system, which divides resources into
multiple categories and uses a potentially different criteria for allocation of units in each
category. These category-specific criteria reflect the balance between ethical values guiding
allocation of units in the category.
If units are placed into a reserve for hardest-hit groups, there are two important remaining
questions: how are the hardest-hit defined and what share of units will be placed into the
category in which the hardest-hit obtain preferential treatment?
We focus on using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) to identify hardest-hit areas, following the
suggestion of Schmidt (2020). The Area Deprivation Index assigns each census block group to a
decile of relative disadvantage by taking a weighted combination of various measures of
disadvantage (Kind and Buckingham 2018) and ranking all census block groups nationally.
Unlike directly using race or ethnicity, which may be subject to court challenges, ADI does not
directly condition on race or ethnicity, but on neighborhood characteristics like education,
income, and homeownership rates. There is precedent for using neighborhood proxies in

6

rationing, for the context of school seat assignment. In the 2007 Parents Involved in Community
Schools vs. Seattle case, the United States Supreme Court decision ruled against directly using
race as a factor in K-12 admissions. Starting in 2009, Chicago Public Schools adopted a
neighborhood-based affirmative action system, using only census tract level measures of
disadvantage (Dur, Pathak and Sönmez 2020; Ellison and Pathak 2020).
ADI has also been used in recent weighted lottery-based schemes, a special case of reserve
systems, to allocate anti-viral drugs (Pathak et. al. 2020b). The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
has used ADI as part of the state’s official policy for allocating scarce COVID-specific
medications, including Remdesivir. COVID patients who reside within the most disadvantaged
neighborhoods in Pennsylvania receive higher priority weights to receive these scarce
medications as part of the State’s allocation lottery (Pennsylvania 2020). An identical system
was first deployed as part of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s triage protocol design
for Remdesivir. In both systems, if a neighborhood has an ADI score of 8 or greater (on a scale
of 1-10), patients receive heightened priority for the anti-viral drug (White et al. 2020). For
pragmatic reasons, and we follow this precedent and refer to an ADI score of 8 or greater as a
high ADI.
Figure 3 reports on the proportion of vaccine doses allocated to high ADI areas under the 2018
CDC Vaccine allocation guideline. ADI is calculated in deciles, so a score of 8 or higher
corresponds to 30% of US neighborhoods. The Figure illustrates that high ADI neighborhoods
receive less than 30% of vaccines if the total supply of vaccines is less than 26 million. That is,
if there are not even enough units to allocate to first tier of patients, then high ADI areas will be
underrepresented. However, as soon as the number of units is enough for Tier 2, roughly 30% of
units will be allocated to high ADI areas, a fair share relative to their geographic representation.
To use ADI as part of a vaccine rationing scheme, we illustrate a reserve system with two
possibilities: either a 20% or 40% high-ADI reserve, implemented in an over-and-above way.
This means that for a given total number of vaccine units, we categorize them in two groups.
The first group is offered vaccine doses based on the as-is, unmodified 2018 CDC priority
system. After allocating those units (it is expected that the first tranche will be fully exhausted),
the system then allocates the high-ADI reserve units, by giving any individual in a high ADI area
the highest priority. If all high-ADI individuals receive a vaccine, then any remaining units in
the high-ADI reserve will be awarded based on the 2018 CDC priority system. In other words,
once all high-ADI individuals receive their vaccines, the overall system reverts back to the 2018
CDC priority system.
The allocation system we consider only uses the high-ADI reserve after allocating all units to
individuals in Tier 1. That is, after all units are allocated to individuals in Tier 1 according to the
2018 CDC vaccine guidelines, any remaining units are then categorized according to the
specified reserve size. We introduce the reserve only after Tier 1 because Tier 1 covers essential
homeland and national security personnel, critical healthcare workers, law enforcement
personnel, pregnant women, and infants and toddlers. We believe that if there are not enough
vaccines to even reach this initial group, considerations associated with targeting the hardest-hit
would be subject to increased scrutiny.

7

Figure 4 illustrates how a reserve system would work for vaccines with a high-ADI reserve
category in addition to the original 2018 CDC category. The top panel shows the proportion of
incremental vaccine units awarded to the high ADI population as the total supply of doses
increases. When there are fewer than 5 million doses, no more than 25% of units are awarded to
the high ADI population. However, as the number of doses increases, the marginal share jumps
to nearly 40%. This results in the cumulative share of vaccines going to high-ADI areas being
30% when there are enough doses to accommodate all individuals in Tier 1, shown in Figure 3.
The second panel of Figure 4 illustrates how the 20% high-ADI reserve works. Since the reserve
system only applies after units are allocated to al Tier 1 recipients, the first change in the
marginal share is at Tier 2. At that point, the marginal share of high-ADI population receiving a
vaccine is roughly 45%, compared to 30% in the absence of any high-ADI reserve given in the
top panel. With a 20% high-ADI reserve, the fraction jumps because a fifth of vaccines are
awarded to the high ADI areas on top of the existing units (80% of 30%) they obtain without
such a reservation. Therefore, the high-ADI reserve provides an additional boost that amounts to
20% for the reserve in addition to the 0.8×30% = 24% through the unreserved units, for a total of
44%.
The second panel also shows how a high-ADI reserve works by placing high ADI individuals
ahead of where they would be prioritized without a high-ADI reserve. When the total number of
vaccines is 230 million, there are no remaining high-ADI individuals left and each has been
allocated a vaccine.
The third panel repeats the same calculation for a 40% high-ADI reserve. As before, the reserve
applies only after units are allocated to individuals in Tier 1. At that point, the marginal share of
units allocated to high ADI jumps to nearly 60%. (As before, 40% + 0.6×30% = 58%). With a
higher reserve size, the number of high-ADI individuals without a vaccine is exhausted by 175
million person-unit vaccines.
B. High-ADI Reserve in Action
A high-ADI reserve results an increase in the proportion of vaccines allocated to Black and
Indigenous recipients. This is shown in Figure 5, which plots the combined Black and
Indigenous allocation for a 20% and 40% high-ADI reserve as well as the 2018 CDC guidelines.
The ADI increases the proportion of vaccines allocated to Black and Indigenous, with a peak
when there are about 75 million units of a vaccine. At that level of supply, a 20% high-ADI
reserve results in 20% of vaccines allocated to Black and Indigenous and a 40% high-ADI
reserve results in about 22% of vaccines allocated to them. Both fractions are still well below
the proportion of COVID deaths or age-adjusted deaths for Black and Indigenous communities.
While the ADI results in an increase in the share of vaccines allocated to Black and Indigenous
persons, it has a modest effect on the regional distribution of vaccines. This can be seen in
Figure 6, which shows how the share calculated either relative to a state’s share of population,
share of cases, or share of deaths changes with a high-ADI reserve. Relative to the state share, a
high-ADI reserve increases the representation of several southern states, but by a modest

8

amount. The effect on the other two measures of fair shares due to a high-ADI reserve is
negligible.
The Appendix reports on several other dimensions of vaccine allocation. Figure A1 adds
Hispanic populations to Figure 5 and shows that a high-ADI reserve results in a higher share of
Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic recipients. At 75 million units, a 40% high-ADI reserve results
in more vaccines to this group than both their share of the population and their share of COVID
deaths. Figure A2 compares a high-ADI reserve to a direct racial reserve for Black and
Indigenous individuals. For levels of vaccines under 100 million person units, a 40% high-ADI
reserve has a similar effect as a 5% reserve for Black and Indigenous individuals. Figure A3
shows that the average age of vaccine recipients is lower than the population average under 2018
CDC guidelines for most levels of vaccine supply. Figure A4 shows that the share of vaccines
allocated to females is higher than the population fraction for vaccine supply less than 100
million person units, but is close to the population female fraction when supply is greater than
100 million person units.
V. Conclusion
The current debate on how to prioritize vaccine allocation for hardest-hit communities has not
wrestled with specific details of whether existing systems are equitable based on empirical data
or how to actually implement heightened priority for particular groups. Since major groups have
not yet finalized guidelines on allocation despite work, we report on how the 2018 CDC
Pandemic Influenza Vaccine guidelines would allocate vaccines to Black and Indigenous
individuals and across states.
Our analysis illustrates the importance of a precise definition of equitable allocation in setting
vaccine allocation policy. We estimate that Black and Indigenous populations combined receive
more vaccines compared to their total population share for all levels of vaccine supply. However,
they receive a substantially lower share compared to their share of COVID deaths or ageadjusted deaths. Moreover, whether the CDC guidelines provide an equitable distribution of
vaccines across states depends crucially on whether population, case-count, deaths, or other
reference points are the appropriate benchmark.
This paper also reports on an implementation of a vaccine allocation system targeting the
hardest-hit communities using a reserve system. In our illustrative reserve system, individuals
from neighborhoods with a high ADI receive preferential treatment for a subset of the total
vaccine supply. A reserve system offers flexibility over a priority system because not all units
have to be assigned according to the same priority order. A 40% high-ADI reserve increases the
share of vaccines to Black and Indigenous individuals, with a modest effect on the distribution of
vaccines across states. A larger reserve size would increase the share for Blacks and Indigenous
individuals further. There are many levers in a reserve system we could consider beyond the
reserve size. However, a reserve system offers a feasible way to implement heightened priority
for disadvantaged groups and has more flexibility than a priority system.
Aside from alternative parameters in a reserve system, there are several directions for further
study. First, our estimate required extrapolation from ACS and BRFSS data, and current

9

estimates of COVID cases and deaths. As improved data become available, it would be
worthwhile to revisit these estimates. The second issue involves take-up. Several studies
suggest that Black and Hispanic (both Hispanic-black and Hispanic-white) adults are among the
least likely to voluntarily take vaccines compared to whites and Asians (Lu et al. 2014, Quinn et
al. 2017). If the goal is to protect the health of these groups, then the system must consider who
is allocated the declined unit, once reasonable efforts to convey the benefits of vaccinations have
been exhausted. Likewise, there may be instances where a high priority individual does not take
a vaccine and instead wishes to give her vaccine access to a lower priority individual, such as a
family member. These kinds of situations may alter the overall distribution of vaccine recipients.
Finally, our analysis has focused on the case where there is a single type of vaccine that is
distributed nationally. New complications and opportunities arise when distribution is not
nationally coordinated and there are multiple vaccines that differ in their effectiveness, safety, or
cost.

Vaccination tiers and population groups for a high/very high level of pandemic severity.
Accessible version at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/national-strategy/planning-guidance/guidance_508.html#figure-1

This figure illustrates how vaccination is administered to population groups by tiers until the entire U.S. population has
had the opportunity to be vaccinated during a pandemic with a high or very high level of severity, and how tiers integrate
population groups, balancing vaccine allocation to occupationally defined groups and the general population.

lation groups identified in each of the
four categories (Table 1) and may vary
based on pandemic severity and supply. However, Tier 1 is the highest priority group to receive
vaccination if there is limited vaccine supply for
any level of pandemic severity; groups within
Tier 1 may change depending on the characteristics and epidemiology of the pandemic and its
impact. For instance, people over age 65 years
are in Tier 2 for a low level of pandemic severity,
but are in Tier 4 for a pandemic with high/very

◆ 10 ◆

groups are included in Tier 1 during a high or
very high level of pandemic severity as societal
disruption is likely during those scenarios, and
they are critical to maintaining the effective
functioning of society. The burden of illness
and absenteeism may be markedly increased
in a pandemic, and the risk of occupational
exposure and infection may be high because of
contact with ill persons, living conditions,
or geographic location.

A1. Overview
A1.1. Data Sources
We base our priority tiers off of the priority tiers for a severe pandemic outlined in the 2018
CDC guidance (CDC 2018a) on vaccine prioritization during an influenza pandemic. The US
population is partitioned into 5 tiers based on essential or high-risk occupations and demographic
factors indicating risk for spreading/contracting severe disease. In case there are not enough
vaccines to go around for even the first tier, the first tier is further partitioned into 7 subtiers. For
tiers 2-5, those in the same tier have equal priority. We assume that among individuals with the
same priority, the vaccine will be distributed at random.
The 2018 CDC document contains estimates, to the nearest 50k, of the number of people within
each group within each tier. These numbers come from “information provided by Department of
Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Health and Human Services, and
U.S. Census Bureau.” These priority tiers sometimes overlap. If someone qualifies for two or
more tiers, they are vaccinated with the highest tier they qualify for. However, the document and
surrounding CDC sites do not specify whether they would be included in each tier's estimated
numbers or only that of the highest tier. In our process, we are assuming that the CDC numbers
encompass those who qualify for higher tiers as well.
As the CDC's data is unavailable to us, we use the American Community Survey (ACS) 20142018 5-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) (U.S. Census Bureau 2014-2018). The 5year PUMS contains two datasets, one containing housing unit characteristics for a sample of
housing units and another containing individual characteristics for the individuals within those
same housing units. We use the person data, which has over 15 million observations, for our
labelling of tiers.
The PUMS person data is a weighted sample. Every observation of an individual in the PUMS
person data is associated with a weight called “person's weight for generating statistics on
individuals” (PWGTP). This weight is “used to bring the characteristics of the sample more into
agreement with those of the full population by compensating for differences in sampling rates
across areas, differences between the full sample and the interviewed sample, and differences
between the sample and independent estimates of basic demographic characteristic estimates of
population characteristics”, according to the ACS Design and Methodology report (U.S. Census
Bureau 2014).
PWGTP was also scaled such that the size of any population group could be estimated by the
sum of PWGTP across observations in the PUMS belonging to the group. Further details about
calculation of weights in the ACS can be found in the PUMS technical documentation (U.S.
Census Bureau 2020a).
In our tier labelling, we have assumed that the CDC-provided numbers include those who may
also qualify for a higher tier, unless the CDC-provided group definitions say otherwise. Our
procedures allow each observation to be marked for as many tiers as the observation qualifies
for. There are specific pairs/sets of groups within tiers that cannot overlap, either by the CDC’s

explicit statement (“not included in higher priority groups”), the CDC’s implicit statement
(“other groups”), or common sense (two groups that the PUMS doesn’t differentiate but should
not actually overlap). Our understanding of those restrictions has been accounted for in our
labelling criteria.
Due to data limitations, we rely on randomization for the assignment of people to certain CDC
groups.
The ACS PUMS does not include data on the presence of high-risk conditions, which impacts
one’s tier priority. We supplement with 2018 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System (BRFSS) (CDC 2018b). As the observations in the BRFSS are unrelated to those in the
PUMS, we rely on randomization to link the two datasets by computing the proportion with a
high-risk condition for each characteristic demographic group in the BRFSS and assigning each
observation in PUMS person data as high-risk using weighted coin flips. More details are in the
“Tier inclusion criteria” section of this document.
We chose to run the tier assignment process only once due to the large size of the dataset and the
large sizes of groups and demographic categories relative to PWGTP. This is not a Monte Carlo
simulation.
We use both the person and the housing unit PUMS data for assigning Area Deprivation Index
(ADI) 2.0 (University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health 2015) to individuals,
as the components of the ADI involve both individual-level attributes found only in the person
data and household-level attributes found only in the housing unit data. We were able to link the
two datasets, as well as identify residents of the same housing unit within the person data, using
the variable SERIALNO, an ID number unique to the housing unit that is present in both the
person and the household data.
We cannot assign the actual ADI of each person in the PUMS data because ADI is computed
using census block level averages and the PUMS geographic specificity only goes down to the
Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) level. We instead approximate the ADI of each family
using averages taken at the family level. We then use SERIALNO to assign to each individual in
the person data the ADI of her family We do not perform any randomization in computing ADI.
Data on proportion of COVID deaths by race/ethnicity and age-adjusted proportion of COVID
deaths by race/ethnicity are sourced from APM Research Lab (2020). The data was accessed
August 11, 2020 and released August 5, 2020, reflecting data releases through August 4.
A1.2.

Simulation Procedure

We consider three treatment groups for strict CDC guidelines, a reserve system with 20% overand-above high-ADI reserve, and a reserve system with 20% over-and-above high-ADI reserve
while the units within the unreserved category and reserve category, including the unreserved
category are allocated using the CDC guidelines. We follow the following procedure in our
simulation analysis.
1. Approximate the ADI of each household as explained in “Calculation of ADI Values”
section of this appendix.

2. Label every person in the PUMS with every group they qualify for. PUMS variables do not
perfectly match up to the groups but can be used as a crude approximation. Our inclusion
criteria for each tier is outlined in the “Tier inclusion criteria” section of this appendix.
3. Determine the highest-ranking tier for which each person qualifies. Determine, also, whether
each person has an ADI in the top 30% of people in the nation we calculate an ADI for
4. For each tier, calculate the demographic averages (proportion breakdown of race, gender,
age, etc.) and total populations of those in the PUMS who qualify for that tier but do not
qualify for any higher tier.
5. Changing total vaccine quantity in 10,000-unit increments of total vaccines from 0 to
100,000 and then in increments of 100,000 vaccine units from 100,000 to 325.7 million (the
US population plus duplicated entries for pregnant women, see the A2.2.4), for each total
vaccine quantity, do the following:
5.1. Using the tier and ADI priority and group size, calculate how many of each group would
receive a vaccine for each amount of total vaccine units under the CDC guidelines and
the reserve system for each high-ADI reserve category size. Assume that for those of the
same priority, vaccine distribution is randomized.
5.2. Using the PUMS data, calculate the proportion Black or Indigenous; proportion Black,
Indigenous, or Latino/Hispanic; proportion female; and average age of individuals who
are allocated vaccines under the CDC guidelines and the reserve system for 20% and
40% high-ADI reserve category.
6. For each state, estimate state population using PUMS individual-level data set, and number
of deaths and cases for each state using CDC data retrieved August 14 (CDC 2020b).
7. For two total vaccine quantities, 20 million and 50 million, do the following:
7.1. Using data vaccine allocation shares found in Step 5, and population estimates found in
Step 6, calculate allocation for each state under the CDC guidelines and the reserve
system for 20% and 40% high-ADI reserve category size. Note that for 20 million
vaccines, the allocation under the CDC guidelines and both reserve sizes are the same.
7.2. Calculate “fair share” indices relative to population, deaths, and cases using the
estimates per state under the CDC guidelines and the reserve system for 20% and 40%
high-ADI reserve category size.
Details about graphing are summarized in the last section of this appendix.
We use statistical open-source R software (version 3.6.1) and Microsoft Excel in our simulation.
the names of program files are given in a table at the end of this appendix. The programs and
data files are available from the authors upon request.

Data issues and imperfect workarounds

A2.2.1.

Occupational specificity and supersetting

3,400,000

132,000,000

For the CDC’s occupation-based groups (the national security, healthcare, and critical industries
groups), the PUMS data does not have the necessary specificity to definitively identify someone
as a member of the group. For example, one of the CDC’s groups is manufacturers of pandemic
vaccine and antiviral drugs. The PUMS data identifies those working in the pharmaceutical

manufacturing industry but does not distinguish people making a COVID vaccine from people
making non-COVID medicines.
Our work-around for the lack of required specificity needed to identify a specific group (such as
manufacturers of pandemic vaccine and antiviral drugs) in the PUMS data is to construct a
reasonable superset of the group (such as all those working in pharmaceutical manufacturing)
and then randomly and independently assign each superset observation to the group with a fixed
probability for the group. The fixed probability is chosen so that number of people in the US
population represented by the observations assigned to the group approximately equal an
externally provided estimate of number of people in the group.
The fixed probability is calculated as follows for assigning observations in a superset S to a
group G that has an external size estimate of N:
𝑃(𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ∈ 𝐺|𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ∈ 𝑆) =

∑8 ∈ 9

𝑁
𝑃𝑊𝐺𝑇𝑃8

PWGTP, the variable representing the weight of each observation in the PUMS person data, is
scaled so that ∑8 ∈ 9 𝑃𝑊𝐺𝑇𝑃8 serves as an estimator for the size of S in the US population.
Subset sizes are all large relative to observation weights.
In the below tier-by-tier details, when we use this supersetting procedure to assign observations
in a superset S to a group G that has an external size estimate of N, we will refer to it with the
following: “Of the superset S, randomly assign N to group G.”
We were not able to find a good external estimate of how many critical inpatient healthcare
providers, outpatient healthcare providers, firefighters, EMS, firefighters, and law enforcement
are frontline vs not frontline. The differences due to these values are confined to shifts between
the subtiers of tier 1 and these values have no impact on cumulative demographics of vaccine
recipients when there is enough vaccine for tier 1. As our reserve system does not kick in until
tier 2, we have decided not to focus on defining frontline personnel and arbitrarily set the size of
each frontline group to 0.5 the size of the critical group (e.g. our external estimate for the size of
the group of frontline EMS is half the size of the group of critical EMS).
A2.2.2.

National security group size

The PUMS data seems to frequently greatly undercount the number of national security and
military personnel in the population. Several times during our group identification exercise, we
constructed what should have been a reasonable superset of a national security-based group only
to have the total person weight of the PUMS superset be several times smaller than the CDC’s
estimate of the group size.
As we do not have access to the data that the CDC uses to come up with their numbers, we
decided to go with the PUMS’s numbers of national security personnel in these cases. More
details can be found in the tier by tier criteria section of this document.

A2.2.3.

High-risk conditions and the BRFSS

The PUMS does not have data on the health conditions of the surveyed individuals. We therefore
impute COVID-19 risk for each observation in the PUMS using the BRFSS data.
We label each observation in the BRFSS as high-risk for COVID-19 if at least one of the
following is true:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The individual has been “(Ever told) you had skin cancer”
The individual has been “(Ever told) you had any other types of cancer”
The individual has been “(Ever told) you have kidney disease” not including kidney
stones, bladder infection or incontinence
The individual has been “(Ever told) you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
C.O.P.D., emphysema or chronic bronchitis”
The individual is obese, defined as having a BMI >= 30
The individual has been “(Ever told) you had angina or coronary heart disease”
The individual has been “(Ever told) you have diabetes,” not including diabetes only
while pregnant, pre-diabetes, or borderline diabetes

For each of the above statements, we consider each statement false if the variable takes any value
other than the one listed, including values for “don’t know/not sure,” “not asked or missing,” and
“refused.” The above variable definitions and question wordings are sourced from the 2018
BRFSS codebook (CDC 2018c).
The medical conditions chosen are an approximation of the CDC list of conditions (CDC 2020a)
that make one of “increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.” As of 8/29/20, the
conditions where people “are at increased risk,” not including the conditions where people
“might be at an increased risk,” are as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Cancer
Chronic kidney disease
COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant
Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher)
Serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or
cardiomyopathies
• Sickle cell disease
• Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Our approximation of COVID-19 risk factors omits immunocompromised state from solid organ
transplant and sickle cell disease due to lack of data in the BRFSS. Our risk factors also include
all diabetes, not just type 2 diabetes, as the BRFSS does not distinguish between different types
of diabetes.
Using the BRFSS data, labelled with whether or not there is high COVID-19 risk, we group the
data by age bin, sex, whether or not the person is Hispanic, and race/ethnicity other than
Hispanic. For each interaction of those variables, we find the proportion of the population that is

high-risk. We omit any observations where one or more of these demographic variables are
unknown or missing.
The age bins are the following:
• 18-24
• 25-29
• 30-34
• 35-39
• 40-44
• 45-49
• 50-54
• 55-59
• 60-64
• 65-69
• 70-74
• 75-79
• 80-84
• 85+
For non-Hispanic race, those of known race are categorized into the following:
• White only
• Black or African American only
• American Indian or Alaskan Native only
• Asian Only
• Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander only
• Other race only
• Multiracial
Hispanic status is coded in a separate variable from non-Hispanic race.
We considered adding income bins to the interaction of demographic variables, but the
introduction of income resulted in lack of data for some variable interactions. We leave income
out to avoid this and for simplicity.
We use to output the high-risk proportion of each demographic interaction in the BRFSS data.
Then, we find the demographic probability of each PUMS person data observation being high
risk based on the proportions calculated from the BRFSS. We then throw a weighted coin for
each individual in the PUMS to label each individual as high risk or not. As the BRFSS does not
have risk factor data for people under 18, we extrapolate the calculated risk probabilities of 18 to
24-year-olds of the same sex, race, and ethnicity for those under 18.
A2.2.4.

Pregnant women

The PUMS data does not have data on whether or not each observation is of someone currently
pregnant. It does denote whether or not a person has given birth in the past 12 months. We create
a cohort of pregnant women in the data via the following steps:

1. Identify the entries in the PUMS data where:
a. The person has given birth in the past 12 months AND
b. We throw an independent weighted coin with heads probability equal to the
length of a pregnancy as a fraction of a year and the coin comes up heads AND
c. The observation is not included in any tier of a higher rank than tier 1 subtier 6.
2. Duplicate the entries identified in tier 1. Mark the duplicates but not the originals as
pregnant. Mark all other entries as non-pregnant.
3. Subtract 1 from the age of the duplicates
The goal of this process is to minimize the differences when comparing the calculated
demographics and size of each tier based on our synthesized dataset with the duplicated entries
versus the calculated demographics and size of each tier based on a counterfactual PUMS dataset
that included pregnancy data. We will refer to this counterfactual dataset in this section as
“pregnancy-complete data” and the calculated values based on it as “pregnancy-complete data
values”.
Note that we could not have simply labelled those marked in step 1 as pregnant without creating
a large and incorrect overlap between entries marked as pregnant and entries that are household
contacts of a baby under 6 months. With the counterfactual pregnancy-complete data, there
would have not been that overlap as most pregnant people intuitively would not also have a
young infant in the house. This issue would cause many of those who would have been Tier 2
with pregnancy-complete data due to being household contacts of babies under 6 months would
have instead been marked pregnant and counted with Tier 1, not Tier 2, potentially causing a
noticeable difference from the pregnancy-complete data for the calculated demographic
composition of Tier 2.
Our method of duplicating some entries and only marking the duplicates as pregnant has the
effect that our calculated demographics and sizes of tiers strictly higher than tier 1 subtier 6 are
identical to those tiers’ pregnancy-complete values. For tiers strictly lower than tier 1 subtier 6,
the difference between the dataset generated with our method and the pregnancy-complete data
is that those that do not qualify for any tier strictly higher than tier 1 subtier 6 AND would have
been known to be pregnant in the pregnancy-complete data are included in the lower tier’s
demographic summary with our method and excluded in the complete data values. As long as
pregnant women compose a small minority of each lower tier, our method minimizes deviations
from the pregnancy-complete data values for all higher and lower tiers.
The demographics and size of tier 1 subtier 6 itself can be reasonably considered similar to the
pregnancy-complete data values. The synthetic cohort of pregnant women are of a size and racial
composition comparable to the true number of pregnant women by nature of our large-scaled
randomization as long as there is little year-to-year variation in pregnancy counts and
demographics and little in- and out-flow of pregnant women and new mothers in the US.
The length of pregnancy used in our calculation was 268 days, referencing Jukic et al. (2013).
The length of a year used in our calculation was 365 days, referencing simplicity and common
sense.
We note that our count of pregnant women using only the ACS (the number of people who gave
birth in the last year, multiplied by the length of a pregnancy as a fraction of a year) is only about

3 million rather than the CDC’s provided 4 million. We do not know the reason for this
discrepancy.

A2.3.

Comment on tier and group sizes

Except for the national security groups affected by the counting issue, our numbers for the sizes
of each occupation-based group are tied to the CDC estimates of group size via the supersetting
procedure.
We do not align the numbers for high-risk demographics with the CDC's numbers, as they're
either fully identifiable or imputable with ACS data (e.g. age-based and pregnancy) or differ for
COVID-19 rather than influenza such that CDC numbers do not apply (e.g. high-risk status).
Our numbers for the sizes of the tiers differ from the CDC estimates of tier size for 2 reasons:
1. The sizes of our demographic-based groups are not tied to CDC estimates and often
differ.
2. We remove those belonging to a higher tier from the count for each tier. As we
understand, the CDC does not.

National security personnel

A2.4.1.1. Tier 1
•

Deployed and mission critical personnel for national security (tier 1 subtier 2)
o CDC size estimate: 850k
o Of the superset of active duty military personnel randomly assign 200k to group
as “deployed personnel.” 200k as an estimate of the number of deployed
personnel comes from Gibbons-Neff and Schmitt (2019).
o Of the superset of observations that have not been assigned as deployed and have
a NAICS code of 928P .ADM-National Security And International Affairs,
randomly assign 650k (850k – 200k) as mission critical personnel

A2.4.1.2. Tier 2
•

•

Critical intelligence services and other domestic national security personnel
o This is the 2nd and 4th groups in Tier 2 combined
o CDC combined size estimate: 300k
o Superset: people in the NAICS industry code of 928P .ADM-National Security
And International Affairs who have not already been included in Deployed and
mission critical personnel for national security (tier 1 subtier 2)
o Randomly assign 300k of this superset to this combined group
National guard personnel not included in tier 1
o CDC size estimate: 500k

•

o We attempted to use the superset of those with a NAICS code of 928110P6 .MILU.S. Armed Forces, Branch Not Specified or 928110P7 .MIL-Military Reserves
Or National Guard who have not already been assigned to tier 1 subtier 2.
However, this set only represents 72k people in the US population, significantly
less than the CDC’s estimate of 500k. As we could not increase our number
without including people from other branches of the military and non-military
individuals, we decided to assign everyone in our attempted superset to this group
instead of going through our supersetting procedure.
Essential military support and sustainment personnel
o CDC size estimate: 650k
o Superset: those with a military NAICS code (928110P1 .MIL-U.S. Army,
928110P2 .MIL-U.S. Air Force, 928110P3 .MIL-U.S. Navy, 928110P4 .MILU.S. Marines, 928110P5 .MIL-U.S. Coast Guard, 928110P6 .MIL-U.S. Armed
Forces, Branch Not Specified, 928110P7 .MIL-Military Reserves Or National
Guard) who have not been assigned to any of the above national security groups
o Randomly assign 650k of this superset to this group

A2.4.1.3. Tier 3
•

remaining active duty military and essential support
o CDC size estimate: 1.5 million
o We attempted to use the superset of those not assigned to a higher-ranking
national security group who are active duty military personnel (MIL == 1) OR
who have a military NAICS code (928110P1 .MIL-U.S. Army, 928110P2 .MILU.S. Air Force, 928110P3 .MIL-U.S. Navy, 928110P4 .MIL-U.S. Marines,
928110P5 .MIL-U.S. Coast Guard, 928110P6 .MIL-U.S. Armed Forces, Branch
Not Specified, 928110P7 .MIL-Military Reserves Or National Guard). However,
this set only represents 254k people in the US population, significantly less than
the CDC’s estimate of 1.5 million. As we could not increase our number without
including non-military individuals, we decided to assign everyone in our
attempted superset to this group instead of going through our supersetting
procedure.

A3. Calculation of ADI Values
A3.1.
Overview
We calculate raw numerical ADI values using the 1990 components and weighing formula from
Singh (2003). Table 1 of Singh (2003), copied below, defines each component in the “Census
Variable” column and provides each component’s weights in the “Factor Score Coefficient”
column.

The raw numerical ADI score of each family is calculated as the weighted sum of its value for
each component using the weights above. For a family F, the raw numerical ADI is as follows:
𝐴𝐷𝐼=>?@ =

A

𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒DEFGEHIHJ,= ∗ 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡DEFGEHIHJ

DEFGEHIHJ

We then assign the raw numerical ADI of each family to each member of the family. We
estimate the raw numerical ADI distribution of the entire U.S., treating each observation i in the
PUMS person data as 𝑃𝑊𝐺𝑇𝑃8 people in the US population. We then divide this national
distribution into 10 national deciles and label them from 1 to 10, where 10 represents the highest
ADI. We define an observation in the PUMS as high-ADI as belonging to a national ADI decile,
or simply “having an ADI”, of >= 8.
A3.2.

Missing values and omitted observations

Most of the PUMS variables we use are not counted for the ~8 million living in group quarters,
which include prisons, nursing facilities, and college/university housing (US Census Bureau
2017). We do not compute a raw numerical ADI for those people and those people are excluded
from the deciles. People in group quarters are automatically excluded from the high-ADI for
reserve purposes. High-ADI is defined as being in the top 3 deciles of people who do not live in
group quarters. Thus, the proportion of people designated as high-ADI is slightly less than 30%.

We note that the actual ADI computed at the census block level also omits computing an ADI for
census blocks with more than 33% of the population living in group quarters (University of
Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health 2015).
For those living in households, any missing components will be considered 0. Every household
has at least 1 missing component, as property value and mortgage are missing for all renters and
gross rent is missing for all who own the houses they live in.
For averages computed at the family level, we consider the household of those living in a
household with a non-missing family income variable to be a family. This includes households
headed by same-sex couples. For those not living with family due to living by themselves or with
non-family roommates, we consider each person to be their own family.

A4.1.

Death rates (actual and age-adjusted) by race/ethnicity

The 8/5/20 release of APM Research Lab’s Color of Coronavirus data only provides actual death
rates and age-adjusted death rates for the racial categories of Indigenous, Asian, Black, Latino,
White, and Pacific Islander, omitting actual death rates and age-adjusted death rates for those
who are multiracial, some other race, or unknown race.
Therefore, to approximate the actual proportion of deceased Covid-19 victims who are Black or
Indigenous, we use the following formula:
S QR =
𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒

𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛Q ∗ 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒Q + 𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛R ∗ 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒R
∑>?DI V R,W,Q,X,Y,ZR 𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛>?DI ∗ 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒>?DI

This equals the true value of Black or Indigenous share of Covid-19 actual deaths with the
following sufficient assumptions:
1. APM Research Lab’s values for each race’s share of population and actual death rate are
accurate given their assumptions, and data deficiencies (APM Research Lab 2020).

2. Of the deceased victims counted by APM Research Labs as multiracial, some other race,
or unknown race, the proportion who identified as Black or Indigenous is equal to
S QR
𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒
The procedure and assumptions for calculating age-adjusted death share for Black and
Indigenous people and the two death rates for Black, Indigenous, and Latino people are
analogous.
A4.2.

State by state distribution

State maps were created as Excel filled maps with a “Diverging (3-color)” color scheme with the
“Midpoint” (yellow) value set at 1.0. The “Maximum” (green) and “Minimum” (red) values are
displayed at the top and bottom of the legend, respectively.
The estimated vaccines received per state under the various reserve systems was calculated in
our main procedures above. The population per state was computed from the ACS data with their
weights. The “fair share” index relative to population is then the ratio of the proportion of the
total vaccines received by a state to the proportion of population living in a state.
To calculate analogous fair share indices relative to case and death incidence, first data on total
confirmed cases and deaths in each state was extracted on August 14 (CDC 2020b). Then the
ratio of cases in each state relative to total cases in the country, and deaths in each state relative
to total death sin the country, were calculated. The fair share index is then the ratio of the
proportion of total vaccines a state received to the proportion of total national cases each state
recorded. This was done analogously for deaths.
All three of these fair share indices were calculated at different total supply levels of vaccines
(e.g. 20 million, 50 million), and for different reserve systems (0% reserve, 20% reserve, 40%
reserve).
