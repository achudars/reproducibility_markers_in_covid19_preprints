Abstract
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is challenging every part of society. From a scientific
point of view the first major task is to predict the dynamics of the pandemic, allowing
governments to allocate proper resources and measures to fight it, as well as gauging the
success of these measures by comparison with the predictions in hindsight. The vast majority
of pandemic models are based on extensive models with large numbers of fit parameters,
leading to individual descriptions for every hot spot on the world. This makes predictions and
comparisons cumbersome, if not impossible.
We here propose a different approach, by moving away from a description over time, and
instead choosing the total number of infected people in an enclosed area as the independent
variable. Analyzing a few hot spots’ data, we derive an empirical formula for the dynamics,
dependent only on three variables. The final number of infections is strictly connected to one
fit parameter we call mitigation factor, which in turn is mostly dependent only on the enclosed
population. Despite its simpleness, this description applies to every of the around 50 countries
we have analyzed, allows to separate different waves of the pandemic, provides a figure of
merit for the overall usefulness of government measures, and shows when a pandemic is
ending. Our model is robust against undetected cases, and allows all nations, in particular
those with fewer resources, to reasonably predict the outcome of the pandemic in their
country.
Significance statement
Based on the empirical data for the number of infections in around 50 countries we propose a
simple, yet universally applicable model for the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast to
previous models, our description depends on the total number of infected people instead of time.
This change of independent variable constitutes the crucial step to analyze different countries
worldwide within one mathematical framework with very few parameters. Our model describes the
pandemic astonishingly well, including multiple waves, enforcing and loosening of measures and its
endpoint, provides a figure of merit to estimate the success of the measures to fight it, and allows all
nations, in particular those with fewer resources, to analyze its struggle against the pandemic
efficiently.

I.

Introduction

A proper mathematical modeling is a quintessential prerequisite to understand a pandemic, as
was already stated by Sir Ronald Ross [1]. Quite generally, there are two strategies to model

pandemics. The “micro”- method relies on following the fate of each member of the
population, tracking all its contacts to microscopically model the pandemic in the way of a
“Maxwell’s Demon” [2]. Unfortunately, just as in the case of the latter concept's origin in
thermodynamics, this is not possible due to the lack of sufficient information. Therefore, in
the other strategy, only average “macroscopic” aspects, like the total number of infections, or
average rates of infection and recovery, are taken into account. Most models are based on the
so-called SIR model or extensions from it [1,3-10] and all quantities being described as a
function of time. These models divide the population in various compartments as susceptibles
(S), infected (I) and recovered (R) in case of the standard SIR model. These compartments are
coupled via rates for infection, recovery and mitigation measures (see e.g. [11]) in a set of
nonlinear differential equations and their solutions are fitted to the empirical data. An
important quantity in these models is the basic reproduction number R0 [4,9,11], since it
allows to characterize the dynamics of a pandemic with a single number. Looking at the best
available models [11-14] it turns out that the current COVID-19 pandemic requires rather
complex extensions of the SIR model with time-varying parameters, the number of which can
easily reach more than one hundred. We have tried to reduce the number of parameters as
much as possible, but still being able to describe for all countries at least the initial stage of
the pandemic, whereby we found a minimum of 18 parameters necessary (see the modelling
based on [14] presented in the supplementary materials, section S1).
As a consequence every country which has become a hotspot for the pandemic has been
treated individually with hugely varying conclusions (see e.g. [11-28]). This in turn has led to
very different approaches to tackle the crisis even in geographically and culturally close
countries. Furthermore, the rather abstract nature of the parameters of these models has
provoked a lack of public insight undermining the authority of governments worldwide in this
time of crisis. A serious problem of this approach, which has been overlooked in the current
discussion and might explain the large sensitivity on the free parameters in these models, is
that except for the simple SIR model [29], they suffer from chaotic behavior [30].
Going back to mathematics, a pandemic with exponential growth can be described by the first
order differential equation [4,5,8,27]
dN (t )
 (t )  N (t ) ,
dt

(1.1)

where  denotes the growth rate which is related to the doubling time D by   ln(2) / D ,
provided that the number of infected persons N is much smaller than total population
2020-09-28

2

N 0  const (which for the current pandemic is the case). Every equation of this form can be
solved exactly if one knows the dependence of the growth rate on time (t ) . Within the SIR
type models one tries to obtain this function from solving the pandemic equations. However,
another possibility is to know the growth rate ( N ) as function of the number of infections N,
given the initial condition N(0) 1. A well-known example for this is the Gompertz model [5,
8, 31] for which Eq. (1.1) can be cast into a form dN / dt  r ln( N finit / N ) N , giving directly
( N )  r ln( N finit / N ) . This model has been used, e.g., to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic in

Germany [31] and Iran [32].
The idea central to this contribution is to derive a functional dependence for ( N ) (or
equivalently for D( N ) ), which is much more general that the Gompertz model and valid for
any pandemic (under the condition of closed populations), from a thorough analysis of the
empirical time series of the infection numbers of many realizations of the current pandemic.
Obviously, one can characterize with such a general functional relation the dynamics of a
pandemic independent from any modelling assumptions. Furthermore, the graphical
representation of this relation, which we will call a “characteristic plot”, gives intuitive insight
in the pandemic.
Such an aim currently seems to be reasonable because of the extreme travel restrictions
imposed worldwide, whereby most countries have effectively restricted or completely
removed travel across its borders, at least during most of the time of the first wave. This
isolation yields the unique advantage of having almost perfectly closed systems with fixed
population numbers and supplies a huge number of experimental realizations of the pandemic.
In the following, we will demonstrate that by analyzing the empirical data from countries with
sufficient resources to give reliable infection numbers (for the problem of undetected
infections see section IIIc), to be able to extract a simple law for the general dynamics of the
pandemic. This law describes D( N ) with only three parameters: 1. The doubling time D0 at
the beginning of the pandemic characterizing the initial spread of the infection, 2. a
proportionality constant  coined “mitigation factor” that describes an exponential growth of
D , and 3. the end point of the pandemic N finit . Most important, we find a strict correlation

between  and N finit , the smaller  the larger N finit . Based on this very simple model we show
that all centers of outbreak follow this law. Furthermore, it allows us to identify different

waves in specific countries as well as the onset and easing of measures, evaluate the
usefulness of certain measures, and, most importantly, provide a criterion for when the
epidemic ends. All of this allows drawing very general conclusions on how the pandemic
evolves in different countries, how to act now, when a new wave of outbreaks hits or a new
pandemic arises.

II.

Results

For a first test we choose four countries with a wide spread in population numbers namely
Luxembourg (LU), Switzerland (CH), the Netherlands (NL), and Italy (I). In all countries we
can expect the data to be reliable. The infection data were taken from [33,34]. Given a time
series of infection data {ti , N i ; i  1

M } , an estimate for (t ) can be calculated by

(ti )  ( N i 1  N i ) / [ N i  (ti 1  ti )] . From these the dependence of log( D( N )) on N , which

will be called the “characteristic plot” can be calculated and is shown in Fig. 1. We can
clearly identify four phases: A) an initial phase with very few infection numbers (marked by
the black dots) with irregular behavior, probably due to statistical error because of the small
numbers, which we will neglect. B) A second phase (“linear regime”), where the doubling
times increase exponentially (linear increase in the logarithmic plot) marked by red dots. C)
The exponential increase is followed by a super-exponential rise (blue dots), which however
stops before diverging (which would be the endpoint of the pandemic N finit ). D) The last
phase (marked by magenta points) shows a decrease of D( N ) . Of course it would be possible
to describe this phase by a negative slope of log( D( N )) . However, as suggested by the time
dependence of the daily numbers of new infections that clearly show a second wave, a
straightforward consideration shows that this phase characterizes indeed a “second wave” of
the pandemic. Because of the statistical independence of the different waves, one can assume
that for N  N finit only the second wave is active. Therefore, its characteristic plot is obtained
by subtracting from the total infection numbers just N finit (or to be more accurate -as has been
done in the actual analysis- the infection numbers N(t) calculated from Eq. (1.1)) and
calculating from these data the doubling times, which are given in Fig. 1 by the orange filled
circles, which show a similar behavior as in the first wave. To describe then another wave of
the pandemic one has to set up another differential equation (1.1) and integrate it with the then
applicable mitigation factor and endpoint. The total infection number is then the sum of both
partial infection numbers.

From this analysis, we suggest the following “ansatz” for the growth constant  (during one
wave of a pandemic)

( N ) 

ln(2)
exp(  0  N ) / f finit ( N ) .
D0

(1.2)

The constant  0 will be designated as the “mitigation factor” as it reflects the effectiveness of
mitigation measures and D0 the initial doubling time. The function f finit ( N ) describes a
super-exponential growth of D and can be assumed as2

f finit ( N )  1 


1
N 
tan 2  
.

 2 N finit 

(1.3)

To obtain the parameters D0 ,  0 and N finit we applied a least-square fit to the empirical
doubling times in the first and second wave of the pandemic. Note that for the Netherlands,
Switzerland, and Italy, the second wave is still in its “linear” regime and here we are not able
to deduce the endpoint. The results are given in Table 1 and from these we generate the blue
lines in Fig. 1. For a straightforward solution of Eq. (1.1) (together with Eq. (1.2)) with a
differential equation solver we need to specify only the number of infections N start at a certain
date tstart where we set the origin of time to the 1st February 2020, and used the parameters D0
,  0 and N finit from table 1. The results are depicted in Fig. 2 showing that the empirical data
are extremely well described by our model (red lines) for all phases of the pandemic. Notice
that the noise and also the oscillations present in the empirical data have only little influence
on the result of the integration as they average out.
Exemplarily, we look more closely on the time dependence of the doubling time for
Switzerland (green and magenta circles and lines). In the first days of the pandemic the
doubling times are almost constant (with some statistical jitter due to the small numbers)
leading to the exponential growth of the infection number. Then the measures used by all
countries to control the epidemic begin to work and the doubling times increase up to a
maximum and then decrease again. We interpret this decrease not as a change in mitigation
measures but as the beginning of a second wave following the same rules as the first wave.

2

This function has been chosen because it describes the empirical data rather well, but using any other
function with a divergence at N  N finit is possible.

2020-09-28

Note the quite substantial non-linearity, despite the simplicity of the laws given by Eqs. (1.2)
and (1.3).
Since the initial doubling time D0 should depend only on genuine properties of the pandemic,
we expect it to be almost constant and indeed this is the case. In contrast,  0 and N finit are
varying considerably with the number of inhabitants of the country chosen, which were taken
from [36]. However, despite of the huge variation of the population numbers by two orders of
magnitude we find that the product of the mitigation factor and the end number of infections
turns out to be almost constant (deviations less than 10%), see the last entry of Table 1. This
means that the end of the pandemic is closely related to the exponential increase of doubling
times with infection number suggesting a relation

Nfinit  c   d .

(1.4)

We also find that the product of population number and mitigation factor N 0  0 remains
nearly constant (see Table 1), however, with a larger variation. This suggests a relation of the
form
b
  a  N pop
.

(1.5)

If both relations can be substantiated from our analysis, this would have far reaching
consequences, because it means that the total number of infections depends only on the
number of inhabitants in a certain country!
To check whether these relations are indeed a generic behavior of the pandemic, we applied
our analysis to a large number of other countries, i.e. Australia (AU,*), Austria (AT), Belgium
(BE,*), Brazil (BR,*), Czechia (CZ), Denmark (DK), France (FR), Germany (DE,*), Hungary
(HU), Iceland (IS), India (IN,*), Ireland (IE), Japan (JP), New Zealand (NZ), Russia (RU),
South Korea (KR,*), Spain (ES,*), Sweden (SE,*), Taiwan (TW,*), United Kingdom (UK,*),
United States of America (US), and also to several states of Germany like Bavaria (Bay),
Hamburg (HH,*) North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
(MV,*). For a selected number of cases (marked by an *) the detailed fits of the doubling
times and the solutions of Eq. (1.1) are plotted in Fig. S2 to S8 (see SOM). For all countries
the parameters of the fits and the number of inhabitants in each country or province can be
found in Table S1. One should note that most of the countries follow the regular behavior
shown in Fig. 1: an exponential increase of the doubling time followed by a super-exponential

growth, eventually followed by a second wave. However, there are some special cases, which
on first sight do not follow our model. However, as shown in Section IIIb, this is not the case.
All these countries will be indicated with blue color in Fig. 3 where in part a the endpoints are
plotted against the mitigation factor, in part b the latter is plotted against the number of
inhabitants. The initial doubling times are plotted in Fig. S1. In all cases, if not otherwise
marked, the parameters from the first wave are taken.
III.

Discussion

a) Derivation of generic laws
In Fig. 3a the countries with regular behavior given by the full triangles obviously following
very good our ansatz Eq. (1.4), the regression giving c  2.987  0.017 and
d  1.015  0.013 . The open blue triangles denote those countries which are still in the

exponential growth regime, whereby the endpoints calculated with Eq. (1.4) have been used
as ordinates. Note that also countries, which are commonly considered as “special” cases like
NZ, TW, SK, or SE satisfy the generic law Eq. (1.4).
In Fig. 3b the mitigation factors show much more variation between the different countries as
suggested by Eq. (1.5), which means that the main factor that determines the pandemic is the
number of inhabitants in each country. That there have to be other influencing effects is
obvious, as otherwise all points in Fig. 3b would lie on the same line. One of such factors
might be the population density of the region considered. That this is indeed influencing the
mitigation factor can be seen by a comparison of MV with HH (see table S1) which have
almost the same population with a ratio of 35 in population density, but the mitigation factors
differ by a factor of 6.5. Therefore this must be of minor importance (see also Fig. S9).
Therefore, we interpret the deviations as stemming from all the different measures that have
been used to mitigate the pandemic, from complete lock-down (like in China) to
recommendations to reduce social life and take care like in Sweden. To identify such effects a
detailed multivariate study of all the measures has to be done, which however, is far outside
the present contribution and left as interesting work for the future.
Here we only want to remark that the countries fall into two groups (denoted by full and open
red triangles), which behave quite similar with respect to the population numbers. The full
and dashed lines are the result of a logarithmic regression of Eq. (1.5) giving the following
parameters: a  1282  75 (with a  117  30 for the dashed line) and b  1.12  0.06 .

Especially interesting for future studies are countries with more than one wave that switch
between these groups (as AU or IN).
The combination of Eq. (1.5) and (1.4) indeed shows that the maximum final number of
infections and the number of inhabitants of a country is closely correlated, provided that the
country uses the standard measures of border control and social distancing. The expected
pred

endpoint of the pandemic is given by Nfinit
(in the case where the endpoint is not

reached, one may take as a guess the endpoint calculated with Eq. (1.4)). We can therefore
define as figure of merit for the effectiveness of pandemic control the ratio

(1.6)

which is plotted in Fig. 4. Obviously, countries with M  1 have done an excellent job in
controlling the pandemic, those with M  1 have failed in this respect. Comparing with Fig.
3b we can state that countries with high mitigation factor (near the dashed line) have a very
large M , while countries with mitigation factor below the full line in Fig. 3b show a worse
performance in the pandemic.

b) Exceptions and multiple waves
While the pandemic in the majority of the investigated countries follows closely our model,
there are a few cases, where our model seems to be not applicable. However, every exception
we found could be explained as one of the following two cases:
1. The pandemic shows phases with different (positive) mitigation factors. Examples are
BR, DK, IN, RU, US. As shown for the case of Denmark in Fig. 5a, (see also the fits
in Figs. S2 and S3) the pandemic can still be described by our ansatz, but with a multimode behavior where

( N 0 )    0i exp( 0i  N 0 )( bi  )(  ei ) / fi ( N 0 ) ,

(1.7)

i

with ( x) being the Heaviside step function and  bi , ei denoting begin and end of the

i th period of the pandemic, respectively. In other words, our model clearly detects
different phases of the pandemic, which possibly are related to onset and loosening of
measures in the respective regions.

2. The pandemic shows a phase where the doubling times decrease with infection
numbers, but does not show multiple peaks in the daily infection numbers. Examples
are Sweden, South Korea, and the USA. Here, as seen from the analysis in case of
USA (Fig. 5b), a second (or even third) wave of the pandemic is hidden in the
dynamics (see SK in Fig.S3). It is here even possible to determine the endpoint of the
first wave. Actually, every decrease of the doubling time has to be explained by the
onset of a second independent wave.

What is most important for the community is that our model can be applied easily to the world
as a whole. This is shown in Fig. 6, where the characteristic plot (see inset) shows that the
pandemic exhibits clearly a two phase behavior, probably related to a phase were the
pandemic has been effective mostly in Europe and later a phase where it was active in
America and India. At the moment, the pandemic is still in the “linear” regime, with the
endpoint too far to be detectable. However, from the mitigation factor and relation (1.4) one
can estimate that in the end about 90-100 Millions of people will be infected. Note that this
figure also demonstrates the predictive power of our model, as the modelling has been done
only from the empirical data up to 1st of July, and the agreement with the data up to August,
15th is almost quantitative.
c) undetected infections
Finally, we shortly discuss the problem of correct infection numbers which is inherent in all
modelling studies. Increasing the number of infections by  , the daily doubling time is not
altered, only the mitigation factor is reduced by 1/ (1   ) . By this only the position of the
country in Fig. 3b is changed. However, the important relation between the endpoint and
mitigation factor (Fig. 3a) is not changed at all. This means that our model is quite robust
against uncertainties in the exact number of infections.

In conclusion, we have shown that the current COVID-19 pandemic follows generic laws that
can be described by three parameters, the initial doubling time D0 , the mitigation factor  ,
and the endpoint of the pandemic N finit , whereby the latter two are found to be inversely
proportional. While the initial doubling time is almost the same for all countries investigated,
the mitigation factor and the endpoint, however, depend mainly on the number of inhabitants
2020-09-28

9

of the area that is closed during the pandemic, and which is mostly identical with the
population of a certain country. Therefore, our model allows the qualitative prediction of the
pandemic for any country only from the number of inhabitants. Furthermore, by calculating
the figure of merit M (Eq. (1.6)) one can assess the success of the measures taken to reduce
the pandemic. Finally, we stress that we only considered the number of infections. Whether
the death toll also can be described by a similar generic law requires an independent study.

Methods
We used for our analysis of the pandemic the numbers provided by the Johns Hopkins
University [33] up to the 14th of August 2020. We checked the reliability of the data by
comparing to the list provided by the “worldometer” organization [34]. The data for the
German states were obtained from the daily lists of the German newspaper “Die Morgenpost”
[35]. The latter data can be found in the Supplementary Materials. All others are available at
the corresponding web pages. The mitigation factor  and the endpoint of the pandemic were
obtained by a least square fitting of the logarithm of the doubling times to Eq. (1.2) using
standard statistical methods. The same has been done with the regression of Eqs. (1.5) and
(1.4) to obtain the parameters a, b, c, and d . As differential equation solver we used the
routines from MATHCAD15 [37], an example can be found in the supplementary material.

Table1. Model parameters for the four countries as obtained from the fits in Fig. 1A. The
second column gives the number of inhabitants in 2020, the third the initial doubling time, the
fourth the mitigation factor, and the fifth the number of infected people at the end of the
pandemic. The sixth and seventh columns give the products of mitigation factor with the
population number and with the number of infected people at the end of the pandemic.

Fig. 1. Daily doubling times as calculated from the number of infections vs. cumulative
number of infected persons for four countries (top/down: Luxembourg, Switzerland,
Netherlands, Italy). The data show clearly a four-phase behavior, first (black dots) an irregular
behavior at the beginning due to statistical errors, second an exponential increase (red dots)
followed by a super-exponential behavior (blue dots) peaking at some critical infection
number (vertical black line), and followed by a phase with decreasing doubling time (magenta
dots). The red dots after the black vertical line are doubling times calculated by subtracting
cumulative infection number of the first wave from the data (see text). The insets show the
daily infection numbers showing in all cases a second wave.

Fig.3 Part a: Endpoints of the pandemic vs. the mitigation factor. The full red triangles
denote countries with a clear transition into a super-exponential increase of the doubling times
(phase 3), which have been included into a logarithmic regression with Eq. (1.4). The blue
open triangles denote countries which are still in the “linear” regime. Here the expected
endpoints are calculated using Eq. (1.4). The full list of countries and abbreviations is given in
Table S1.
Part b: Mitigation factors  vs. the number of inhabitants for various countries. The red
triangles are those countries, which have been included in the logarithmic regression with Eq.
(1.5) giving the full line, the open red triangles are the countries, which deviate strongly from
the “normal” behavior and have been omitted in the regression. The blue circles denote the
countries with a two phase behavior (second phase). These points are connected by blue lines
to the results of the corresponding first phase.

Sections SI: Analysis of Pandemic by SIR-based models
In order to compare our model to the hitherto used modelling we investigate four countries, namely
Luxembourg, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Italy, which vary over a wide range in population
numbers (see Table S1),
We used a simplified version of the SITAHRTE model of [SI1], which collects the different
compartments of infected persons into only two, those infected but not confirmed, designated by I
and those with a positive diagnosis (D=T+A+R+T), the other compartments being the same. This gives
the name SIDHE for the model. In this way, the eight differential equations of the SITHARTE model

Fig.SI1: Graphical representation oft
he SIDHE model used to describe
the COVID-19 pandemic in a
compartmental model

are reduced to 5 and the number of parameters from 16 to 6 (see Fig. SI1). This model is similar to
those used in [SI2,SI3] but we use a continuous time dependence of the parameters.

The model is described by the following five coupled differential equations

S   S  ( I   D)

(a)

I  S  ( I   D )  (   ) I

(b)

D   I   D  D

(c )

H  I   D

(d )

E  D

(e)

(1.1)

We assume that the parameters  ,  ,  can be time dependent, while the others remain constant.
For the temporal dependences we assumed a maximum of three time ranges, the first comprising
the first four to eigth days, where the pandemic spreads uncontrolled (with parameters  0 ,  0 ,  0 .
The second time ranges comprises the first weeks of lockdown (up to day 20), the third range is up to
day 60, then the pandemic spreads with the parameters from day 60 on.
To get a continuous time dependence we assumed for f   ,  ,  the following form
2020-09-28

26

f (t )  ( f 0  f 2 ) exp   f1(t  t1 )(t  t1 )  f 2 exp   f3(t  t3 )(t  t3 ) 

(1.2)

As shown below, this model allows describing the pandemic quite well with minimum set of
parameters, for Italy similar to those given in [SI1], but also for the other examples.
We used a standard mean-square error minimizer base on the conjugated gradient method. We
minimized both the cumulative cases C (t ) and the number of daily infections C (t ) together. These
quantities are given by the following expressions
t

C (t )  D(t )  E (t )    (t ') D(t ')dt '

(a)

(1.3)

C (t )   (t ) I (t )

The results are given in Table SI1 for the four examples LU, CH, NL, and IT.

Table SI1: Parameters for the SIDHE model.
A closer look at Table SI1 reveals that no systematic behavior due to the still large number of
parameters (in total 17, but much smaller than in the original SIDARTHE model, which for a three
phase regime amounts to 53 [SI1]. Therefore, one tries to condensate their information into one
quantity, the basic reproduction number R0 , which is given in the SIDHE-model as

Its time dependence is shown in Fig. SI2, showing for all countries a similar behavior, but no obvious
conclusion can be drawn. The same is true for the calculated endpoint of the pandemic, which
growth with the number of inhabitants, but that is to be expected.
