ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 outbreak is asynchronous in US counties. Mitigating the COVID-19 transmission requires not only the state
and federal level order of protective measures such as social distancing and testing, but also public awareness of timedependent risk and reactions at county and community levels. We propose a robust approach to estimate the heterogeneous
progression of SARS-CoV-2 at all US counties having no less than 2 COVID-19 associated deaths, and we use the daily
probability of contracting (PoC) SARS-CoV-2 for a susceptible individual to quantify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a
community. We found that shortening by 5% of the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2 can reduce around 39% (or 78K, 95% CI:
[66K , 89K ]) of the COVID-19 associated deaths in the US as of 20 September 2020. Our findings also indicate that reducing
infection and deaths by a shortened infectious period is more pronounced for areas with the effective reproduction number
close to 1, suggesting that testing should be used along with other mitigation measures, such as social distancing and facial
mask-wearing, to reduce the transmission rate. Our deliverable includes a dynamic county-level map for local officials to
determine optimal policy responses and for the public to better understand the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 on each day.

Introduction
The outbreak of new coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused nearly 200,000 deaths in the US, and among those, there are
2,277 counties with no less than 2 associated deaths as of 20 September 20201. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led
to unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including travel restrictions, lockdowns, social distancing, facial
masks wearing, and quarantine to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the US. The COVID-19 outbreak is prolonged and
asynchronous across regions. Thus it is critical to estimate the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic to determine appropriate
protective measures before the availability of effective vaccines.
A non-negligible proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infectious individuals is asymptomatic or have mild symptoms2 . We term the
individuals the active infectious individuals who can transmit the disease to others but may not be diagnosed yet. Identifying
the number of active infectious individuals is crucial to monitor the transmission in a community. Another important timedependent quantity is the expected number of secondary cases resulted from each active infectious individual, or effective
reproduction number. In this article, we estimate these two time-dependent quantities for all US counties with no less than 2
COVID-19 associated deaths as of 20 September 2020; the population of some counties that falls within this category is even
less than ten thousand. Furthermore, based on these two time-dependent quantities, a more interpretable measure, called the
daily probability of contracting (PoC) SARS-CoV-2 for an individual at the county-level was used to quantify the risk. This
static risk factor with fixed transmission rates was studied before3. Here we studied the dynamic transmission rate parameter,
which is estimated by the number of deaths, test positive rates and the number of confirmed cases in a community. The risk
factor can be extended to measure the risk of an event with different sizes4 . The fine-grain estimation of disease progression
characteristics allows the public to understand the risk of contracting COVID-19 on a daily basis.
Predictive mathematical models are useful for analyzing an epidemic to guide policy responses5 . The epidemiology
compartmental models such as SIR, SEIR, SIRD, and their extensions6–10 , stochastic agent based models11, 12 , branching
processes13 , and network analysis14 have advanced our understanding of transmission rates and incubation period of SARSCoV-2, which are connected to the traffic flow and mobility during the COVID-19 outbreaks at different regions15, 16 . The
disease progression characteristics, such as the transmission rate, are often estimated based on the daily death toll6, 9, 11, 12 .
However, it is challenging to estimate the progression of the epidemic in US counties with small population, because the
number of daily observed confirmed cases and COVID-19-related deaths is small. Meanwhile, using observed laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 cases (henceforth, observed confirmed cases) might significantly underestimate the population that
have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2. It was found in17 that around 9.3% of the US individuals (or roughly 30 million)

may have contracted the COVID by July 2020 based on serology tests, whereas less than 4.8 million COVID-19 positive
cases have been confirmed in the US before August 20201. Thus, it is important to estimate the number of individuals who
contracted COVID-19 but had not tested positive. The focus herein is on integrating COVID-19-related death toll and test
data to obtain a robust estimation of the disease progression characteristics of COVID-19 at county and community levels.
One critical quantity to evaluate an infectious disease outbreak is the time-dependent transmission rate, based on which one
can compute the basic reproduction number and the effective reproduction number of the disease. Various approaches were
proposed to estimate this parameter. The transmission rate was modeled as a decreasing function of the time in6 , a function
of NPIs in11 and a geometric Brownian motion in18 . Unlike the outbreak in China or other countries in north-east Asia,
transmission rates of the COVID-19 progression in the US does not monotonically decrease due to the prolonged duration
of the outbreak, and it is challenging to determine a suitable parametric form of this parameter in terms of time. In9 , the
transmission rate parameter was related to the initial values of infectious cases, resolving cases, and up to two derivatives of
the daily death toll. This method provides a flexible way to estimate the time-dependent transmission rate from the death toll
and its derivatives, yet unstable for counties with moderate or small population sizes, as numerical estimation of the daily
death toll and its derivatives is often unstable.
In this work, we propose a robust approach of integrating test data and death toll to estimate COVID-19 transmission
characteristics by a Susceptible, Infectious, Resolving (but not infectious), Deceased, and reCovered (SIRDC) model initially

Background

Main findings and limitations

Policy implications

The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is heterogeneous and asynchronous in US counties. It
is thus important to assess the risk before lifting or replacing any mitigation measure in
the community. We have developed a novel approach to integrate test data and death
toll to estimate the probability of contracting COVID-19, as well as the time-dependent
transmission rate and number of active infectious individuals at the county level in the US.
National level order of protective measures reduces the transmission rate and active number of infectious individuals for most US counties in April, whereas the risk of contracting
SARS-CoV-2 rebounded between late June and early July, as the protective measures were
relaxed. We found that when the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2 is shortened by 5% and
10%, the number of deaths can be reduced from 199K to 120K (95% CI: [109K, 132K ])
and 80K (95% CI: [72K, 89K]) as of 20 September 2020, respectively, when other protective measures were kept the same. The reduction of the infectious period can be achieved
by extra testing in addition to ongoing protective measures. Our model relies on the existing knowledge of the COVID-19 and model assumptions. Other information, such as
demographic profiles, mobility, and serology test data, can be used to calibrate the model
parameters and assumptions at the community level.
Our model indicates that extra testings, along with the current NPIs, can significantly
reduce the number of deaths associated with COVID-19. The estimated probability of
contracting COVID-19 can be used as an interpretable risk factor to guide community
policy responses.

studied in9 . We illustrate that the transition between different stages of disease progression in the SIRDC model in part a of
Figure 1. First, a part of the population is infected by active infectious individuals each day, depending on the transmission
rate parameter (βt ). After γ −1 days, an active infectious individual is expected to be no longer infectious, denoted by the
resolving compartment, meaning that this individual will not transmit COVID-19 to others as a result of hospitalization or
self-quarantine. We term the average length of an active infectious individual the infectious period. A resolving case is
expected to be resolved (either recovered or deceased) after θ −1 days. The proportion of deaths from the number of resolved
cases is controlled by the fatality rate parameter δ .
Our approach has three innovations. First, we solve the compartmental models using a midpoint rule with a step size of 1
day, as the confirmed cases and death toll are updated daily in most US counties, and this is discussed in the method section.
Second, we combine test positive rates, confirmed cases and death toll to estimate the daily transmission rate parameter. Our
estimate of transmission rates and reproduction numbers is robust and accurate to reproduce the number of the death toll
and other compartments for counties with medium to small population sizes (Figure 3 and Extended data Figure S1). The
simulated studies also suggest that our approach is more robust than the solution in9 (Extended Data Figure S2), as our solution
does not require estimating derivatives of the daily death toll. Only two parameters, the initial values of the number of active
infectious individuals and the number of resolving cases, need to be estimated numerically for each county. Then we can solve
the time-dependent transmission rates and all other compartments subsequently. Since only two parameters are estimated for
each county, our estimation rarely depends on initial values we choose for the optimization. Finally, we use a Gaussian process
to model the residual between the observed death toll and that from the SIRDC model, leading to more accurate predictions
and proper uncertainty quantification. A summary of the main findings, limitations, and policy implication are given in Table
1.

Results
We first verify our model performance by forecasting at the county level. The 7-day and 21-day death projections for 2, 277
US counties using data by 20 September 2020, for instance, are close to the held-out test death toll in these counties, shown in
part b and part c of Figure 1. The Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ ) is larger than 0.999 7-day and 21-day forecast. We also
calculate the weighted average of Pearson correlation coefficient for counties (ρcounty ), which treats each county as a different

population and population size is used to computed the weighted average of Pearson correlation coefficient for counties. The
21-day forecast of each considered county in Florida and California using observations by 20 September 2020 is provided in
Extended Data Figure S6 and S7, respectively. The death toll forecast based on our model is accurate for most US counties,
and around 95% of the held-out test data is covered by nominal 95% predictive interval (Table S1 in supplementary materials),
indicating that the uncertainty assessment is accurate. To further test the predictive performance of our model, we use data by
1 December, 2020 to make 21-day and 90-day predictions of deaths in the 10 largest counties in Florida and California. The
forecast results are shown in Extended Data Figure S8 and S9, respectively. While this is a challenging scenario, as confirmed
cases and deaths increase dramatically across the US during the winter, we found that our 21-day predictions are reasonably
accurate for all 20 counties. Thus, our models can be used reliably for the short-term projection of COVID-19 related deaths

at the county level during different periods of the epidemic. Furthermore, a 90-day accurate forecast of US counties before
the winter may be an almost impossible task, and indeed we underestimate death counts for a few counties due to a rapid
increase in death counts during the winter. On the other hand, our model that fuses test data and death toll correctly projects
the rapid increase in death counts for most counties during the winter, even if death counts do not increase dramatically during
the training period.
Based on the robust estimation of transmission rates, we derived the county-level estimation of daily PoC SARS-CoV-2.
We classify the daily PoC SARS-CoV-2 in a community into five levels listed in Table 2. On 20 September 2020, out of
2,277 US counties, only 60 counties were at the controllable level and 311 counties were at the moderate level, whereas
1906 counties were at the either alarming, strongly alarming, or hazardous level. The daily PoC SARS-CoV-2 measures the
average probability to contract SARS-CoV-2 for a susceptible individual in a community, and the risk varies from individuals
to individuals. Nonetheless, the PoC SARS-CoV-2 is an interpretable measure for public understanding of the average risk of
contracting SARS-CoV-2 in a community on a given day.
We graph the estimated PoC SARS-CoV-2 of an individual at US counties on 20 April 2020 and 20 September 2020 in
Figure 2. On 20 April 2020, the PoC SARS-CoV-2 is large in northeastern regions and some southern states such as Arizona,
New Mexico, and New Orleans. On 20 September 2020, the PoC SARS-CoV-2 is large in many inland states, for instance,
Montana, North Dakota, Mississippi, and Alabama. Although the PoC SARS-CoV-2 on 20 September in northeastern regions
is substantially lower than that on 20 April, the PoC SARS-CoV-2 for an individual is large in most other states on 20
September, suggesting that the relaxation of protective measures can lead to more population contracting COVID-19, and
consequently more deaths at a rate no slower than that in late April.
Officials can use the daily PoC SARS-CoV-2 to determine whether the mitigation policies can be lifted or replaced by other
measures for different regions. The probability of contracting COVID-19 in many counties in Texas on 20 September 2020,
for example, is larger than those in Washington (part (a) and (d) in Figure 3), indicating that Texas should undertake more
protective measures to reduce the risk. The nationwide lockdown order and social distancing in spring effectively reduced the
PoC SARS-CoV-2 in 4 out of 5 counties in Washington, while the PoC SARS-CoV-2 of all counties increases in late June
and early July, as some of the nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were lifted (part b in Figure 3). Part (c) shows that the
model fits the death toll. With only two parameters estimated numerically for each county, the fit is reasonably good for these
counties at a wide range of dates. In comparison, though the outbreak of 5 counties in Texas started in early summer, the PoC
SARS-CoV-2 in these Texas counties is much higher than that in Washington counties on 20 September (part (e) in Figure 3).
Our model also fits the death toll of the counties in Texas relatively well (part (f) in Figure 3). The county-level estimation
and forecast are updated regularly on the COVID-19 US dashboard: https://covid19-study.pstat.ucsb.edu/.
The effectiveness of protective measures were studied to reduce the transmission rate7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 19 , whereas the efficacy of
these measures depends on the reactions from the public, which is likely to vary from region to region. Another simultaneous
effort to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak is through testing and contact tracing, which reduces the infectious
period, and consequently, the number of active infectious individuals. For Washington and Texas, we simulate the model
output with infectious period reduced by 5% (or equivalently 4.75 days in total), while the transmission rate (βt in SIRDC
model) is held the same. We found that the PoC SARS-CoV-2 is reduced by 5 times for 12 counties out of 28 considered
5/21

counties in Washington and 6 counties out of 209 considered counties in Texas, as shown in the Extended Data Figure S3.
Furthermore, when we reduce the infectious period by 10% (or equivalently 4.5 days in total), while the transmission rate (βt
in SIRDC model) is held the same, the PoC SARS-CoV-2 is reduced by 5 times for 26 out of 28 counties in Washington and
146 out of 209 counties in Texas, shown in Extended Data Figure S4.
We graph the estimated effective reproduction number, the number of active infectious individuals, and the cumulative
death toll in the US, along with the simulated values when the average infectious period is reduced from 5 days to 4.75 days
and 4.5 days in Figure 4. First, we found that mitigation measures in March effectively reduce the effective reproduction
number to below 1, whereas the value rebounded in summer after some of these measures were relaxed in different regions.
Consequently, the US has experienced two waves of the outbreak in terms of the number of active infectious individuals
(part (b) in Figure 4). The high test positive rate at the beginning of the epidemic (Extended Data Figure 5) indicates that a
substantial number of active infectious individuals were not diagnosed in April due to the lack of diagnostic tests. According
to our estimates, the peak of the first wave in April is larger than that of the second wave in July in terms of the number of
active infectious individuals, whereas the peak of the daily observed confirmed cases in April is smaller than that of the second
wave in July (Extended Data Figure 5).
Second, the simulated results suggest that shortening infectious period of SARS-CoV-2 by 5% and 10% can reduce the
total deaths from 199K to 120K (95% CI: [109K, 132K]) and 80K (95% CI: [72K, 89K]), respectively, as of 20 September
2020, when other protective measures were held as the same (part c in Figure 4). Note that since we held the transmission rate
parameter (βt ) to be the same (a scenario where the public adheres to the protective measure same as the reality), the effective
reproduction number barely changes (part a in Figure 4). However, the slightly shortened infectious periods of SARS-CoV-2
can reduce the death toll substantially (part c in Figure 4), as the number of active infectious individuals decreases (part b in
Figure 4).
We found that a shortened infectious period substantially reduces the number of active infectious individuals and fatalities
in the second wave. However, the changes are smaller in the first wave, since the effective reproduction number in the second
wave is smaller than that in the first wave (Figure 4). The county level estimation also validates this point (Extended Data
Figure S3 and S4). This finding indicates that the efforts of shortening the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2 should not
replace the other protective measures, such as social distancing and facial mask-wearing to reduce the transmission rate.
Diagnostic tests can be used to shorten the length of the infectious period of an active infectious individual. Drastically
reducing the infectious period may not be possible without contact tracing, which is challenging when there is a large number
of active infective cases. Reducing the infectious period by around 5%, in comparison, may be achieved by periodically diagnostic tests every 20 days for each susceptible individual. More frequent testing or contact tracing may be needed to achieve
this goal, as the infection is most likely to happen between days 2 and 6 after exposure due to the high viral load of SARS-CoV220 . Another efficient way is to test susceptible individuals with a high risk of contracting or spreading SARS-CoV-2, such as
individuals with more daily contacts or have contacts with vulnerable populations, e.g., workers from senior living facilities.
Our estimation of the PoC SARS-CoV-2 can be used as a response to develop regression models using covariates including
demographic information and mobility to elicit personalized risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 for susceptible individuals.
Finally, efforts on reducing the length of the infectious period should not replace other protective measures for reducing
transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2, as the number of active infectious individuals and death toll can be effectively reduced
only if the effective reproduction number is not substantially larger than 1.

Discussion
Our study has several limitations. First, our findings are based on the available knowledge and model assumptions, as with
all other studies. One critical parameter is the death rate, assumed to be 0.66% on average21, whereas this parameter can
vary across regions due to the demographic profile of the population and available medical resources. The studies of the
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies based on serology tests17 can be used to determine the size of the population who have
contracted SARS-CoV-2, and thus provides estimates on the death rate, as the death toll is observed. Besides, we assume
the infected population can develop immunity since recovery for a few months, which is commonly used in other models.
The exact duration of immunity post-infection, however, remains unverified scientifically. Third, we assume that the number
of susceptible individuals and, consequently, the number of individuals who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 can be written
as a function of the number of observed confirmed cases and test positive rates, calibrated based on the death toll. More
information such as the proportion of population adhere to the mitigation measures, mobility, and demographic profile can be
used to improve the estimation of susceptible individuals in a region.
Our results can be used to mitigate the ongoing pandemic of SARS-COV-2 and other infectious disease outbreaks in the
future. The estimated daily PoC SARS-CoV-2 at the county level, for example, is an interpretable measure to understand the
risk of contracting COVID-19 on a daily basis and a surveillance marker to determine appropriate policy responses. Besides,
Our method can be extended when an effective vaccine becomes available10. Finally, further studies of this measure relative to

where Si, j (t), Ii, j (t), Ri, j (t), Di, j (t) and Ci, j (t) denote the number of individuals at these 5 compartmental groups on day t,
respectively, and Ni, j denotes the number of individuals in county j from state i for i = 1, 2, ..., k, j = 1, 2, ..., ni with ni being
the number of counties of the ith state considered in the analysis and t = 1, 2, ..., Ti, j . The time-dependent transmission rate
parameter is denoted by βi, j (t) and the inverse of average number of days an infectious individual can transmit the COVID-19
is denoted by γ . The inverse of the average number of dates for a case to get resolved (i.e. deceased or recovered) is denoted
by θ and the proportion of deceased cases (i.e. death rate) is denoted by δ . The parameters (γ , θ , δ ) were invariant over time
and held fixed in this study. Following19, we assume the infectious period to be 5 days on average, and a case is expected
to resolve after 10 days. The average death rate is assumed to be 0.66%21 . Additional verification of these assumptions and
sensitivity analysis of these parameters are provided in the supplementary materials.
To determine the characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic at US counties, we define the time-dependent effective
i, j
i, j
reproduction number, i.e. the average number of secondary cases per primary cases as Re f f (t) = R0 (t)Si, j (t)/Ni, j , where
the R0i, j (t) = βi, j (t)/γ denotes the basic reproduction number on day t. When Rei,fj f (t) < 1, it means that the number of
i, j

the active infectious individuals will decrease (and vice versa, if Re f f (t) > 1). The effective reproduction number was often
7/21

used to quantify whether or not the disease is under control22. However, the effective reproduction number does not directly
quantify risk of contracting SARS-COV-2 for a susceptible individual, as the number of active infectious individuals in a
region was not taken into consideration. We compute the average probability of contracting (PoC) SARS-CoV-2, denoted as
Pi, j (t) = Rei,fj f (t)Ii, j (t)γ /(Si, j (t)) = βi, j (t)Ii, j (t)/Ni, j , which quantifies the risk of a susceptible individual in county j from
state i to catch SARS-CoV-2 on day t. Here the risk is on an average sense among all susceptible individuals in a region.
The most critical parameter of the SIRDC model is the transmission rate parameter, βi, j (t), as a function of time, based on
which we obtain the reproduction number on day t. To estimate the time-dependent transmission rates for communities with
small population sizes, we derive a more robust estimation of the transmission rate of each county based on the death toll and
testing data, discussed below.
Closed-form expressions of the time-dependent transmission rates. Since the observations such as death toll and confirmed cases are generally updated daily, we solve the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in the SIRDC model (equation
(1)) approximately by the midpoint rule of the integral with a step size of 1 day. For day t ∈ N+ , the approximation is described

Further by assuming the transmission rate parameter βi, j (t) is day-to-day invariant (i.e. a step function with step size 1),
based on equations (2) and (3), we obtain βi, j (t + 0.5) from t = 1 to Ti, j − 1, iteratively, based on the sequence of susceptible

individuals {Si, j (t)}t=1
and the initial number of active infectious individuals Ii, j (1) described in algorithm 1.

Algorithm 1: Iterative approach for estimating transmission rate βi, j (t + 0.5).
After we get the number of active infective individuals (Ii, j (t)) on each day, sequences of the resolving, deceased and
recovered compartments can be solved subsequently following the same manner using equation (4)-(6), after specifying their
initial values. Expressing the time-dependent transmission rate by the number of susceptive and infective cases is the key to
integrating death toll and testing data for estimation.
In Extended Data Figure 1 and 2, we demonstrate that in order to solve the ODEs in the SIRDC model, our approach is
more accurate and robust than the method F&J in9 under both simulated and real scenarios. Other more accurate methods
(such as the Runge-Kutta method) can also solve the ODEs of SIRDC model, but the time-dependent transmission rates can
not easily be expressed as a function of the death toll and the number of active infectious individuals as the way they are in
our solution.
Estimation of the number of susceptible individuals. Note that we have Si, j (t) + coi, j (t) + cui, j (t) = Ni, j for any t, where
o
ci, j (t) and cui, j (t) are the number of cumulative observed confirmed cases and unobserved confirmed cases, respectively. Estimating the number of susceptible individuals is equivalent to estimating the number of unobserved confirmed cases cui, j (t),
8/21

because the number of observed confirmed cases coi, j (t) and the population Ni, j are known. Here we combine them with
the positive test rates to estimate cui, j (t), as large positive test rates typically indicate a large number of unobserved confirmed
cases. We assume that the total number of confirmed cases is equal to the observed confirmed cases, adjusted by the state-level
test positive rate pi (t), a power parameter αi and a weight parameter ωi , leading to the following formula of the susceptible
population:
(

(7)
ωi, j
s=2
where ∆coi, j (t) is the observed daily confirmed cases on day t, for t = 1, 2, ..., Ti, j , i = 1, 2, ..., k and j = 1, 2, ..., ni . Since the
positive test rates are only available at the state level, the power parameter αi ∈ [0, 2] is estimated by the state-level observations.
According to equation (7), the time-invariant weight ωi, j can be expressed below:

ωi, j =

(pi (1))αi coi, j (1)
Ii, j (1) + Ri, j (1) + Di, j (1) + Ci, j (1)

,

(8)

where Ii, j (1), Ri, j (1), Di, j (1) and Ci, j (1) are the number of active infectious, resolving, deceased and recovered cases on day
1, respectively.
Estimation of initial values of infectious and resolving cases. We define day 1 of a county as the more recent date
between 21 March 2020 and the date that the county has 5 observed confirmed cases for the first time. Since all counties were
at an early stage of the epidemic on the starting day, we let the initial value of the death toll Di, j (1) be the observed death toll
on the day 1, and the initial value of the recovered cases be 0. This assumption is not likely going to strongly influence our
analysis, as the number of recovered cases is only a negligible proportion of the susceptible individual on the starting day if
not zero. The only parameters to estimate are the number of infectious individuals Ii, j (1) and the number of resolving cases
Ri, j (1) on the day 1 for county j from state i, after the power parameter αi is estimated using the state-level observations to
minimize the same loss function below:

for t = 1, 2, . . . , Ti, j .
After the initial values of infectious and resolving cases are estimated, we obtain the estimation of the susceptible cases
from equation (7), and the infectious cases and transmission rates on each date for each county from Algorithm 1. The resolving cases, deaths, and recovered cases can be derived subsequently from equation (4)-(6), respectively. The estimated basic
and effective reproduction rates can be derived by the fitted time-dependent transmission rate, and the estimated probability of
contracting SARS-CoV-2 for an individual can be computed based on transmission rate and number of infectious individuals
for each county on each day.
Forecast and uncertainty assessment. Our method can also be used as a tool for forecasting compartments (e.g., death
toll), reproduction numbers, and the probability of contracting SARS-CoV-2 at each county for a short period. We extrapolate the transmission rate based on Gaussian processes implemented in RobustGaSP R package23 with robust parameter
estimation24, 25 . Based on the extrapolated transmission rates, the compartments can be solved iteratively based on equation
(2)-(6).
We also found that the forecast will generally be improved by modeling residuals between observed deaths and modeled
deaths by a zero-mean Gaussian process (GP). One advantage of a GP model is the internal assessment of the uncertainty of
the forecast from the predictive distribution, which is of crucial importance. The aggregated model that combines the SIRDC
model and the GP model for county j from state i in the US is described as follows.
Di, j (t) = Fi, j (t) + zi, j (t) + εi, j,t ,

(10)

where Di, j (t) and Fi, j (t) denote the observed death toll and estimated death toll via the SIRDC model, respectively; The
noise follows independently as a Gaussian distribution εi, j,t ∼ N(0, σi,2 j,0 ) with variance parameter σi,2 j,0 . The latent temporal
9/21

process zi, j (t) is modeled by a zero-mean GP, meaning that for time points {1, 2, . . ., Ti, j }, zi, j = (zi, j (1), . . . , zi, j (Ti, j ))T follows
a multivariate normal distribution:
zi, j ∼ MN(0, Σi, j ),
where the (l, m) entry of Σ i, j is parameterized by a covariance function σi,2 j Ki, j (l, m) for 1 ≤ l, m ≤ Ti, j . Here σi,2 j is the
variance parameter and Ki, j (·, ·) is a one-dimensional correlation function. We use the power exponential correlation function:
 
 
| l−m | a
,
Ki, j (l, m) = exp −
bi, j
where a is the roughness parameter fixed to be 1.9 as in other studies26, 27 , to avoid possible singularity in inversion of the
covariance matrix using the Gaussian correlation (a = 2), and bi, j is a range parameter for each county estimated from the
data. We define the nugget parameter ηi, j = σi,2 j,0 /σi,2 j . The range parameter bi, j , and the nugget parameter ηi, j in equation
(10) are estimated based on the marginal posterior mode estimation using the rgasp function in the package RobustGaSP
available on CRAN24 .
Denote Di, j = (Di, j (1), ..., Di, j (Ti, j ))T and Fi, j = (Fi, j (1), ..., Fi, j (Ti, j ))T . After marginalizing out the variance parameter
by the reference prior p(σi,2 j ) ∝ 1/σi,2 j , for any t ∗ , the predictive distribution of zi, j (t ∗ ), conditional on the observations, range
parameter bi, j and nugget parameter ηi, j , follows a non-central Student’s t-distribution with degrees of freedom Ti, j 24

by plugging in the estimated range parameter bi, j and nugget ηi, j . The predictive mean ẑi, j (t ∗ ) for forecasting the death toll of
the jth county in the ith state at a future day t ∗ and the predictive interval can be computed based on the Student’s t distribution. An overview of the forecast algorithm and the numerical comparison of different approaches in forecast is given in the
supplementary materials.

Supplementary materials
The supplementary materials contain three parts. In the first part, We discuss the details of model parameter specification
and conduct a sensitivity analysis. The forecast algorithm and numerical comparison of different approaches are introduced
in the second part. The third part contains three videos for the county-level estimation of the daily PoC SARS-CoV-2 of a
susceptible individual, the effective reproduction numbers, and the number of active infectious individuals from 21 March
2020 to 20 September 2020.

1 Model parameter specification and sensitivity analysis
We discuss the choice of the model parameters and their sensitivity analysis. The following parameters of the SIRDC model
were specified based on previous studies.
• The death rate or the infection fatality ratio (δ ) that measures the proportion of death among all infected individuals.
We assume δ = 0.66% following21.
• The inverse of the number of days an infectious individual can transmit the COVID-19 (γ ). The average time of a
COVID-19 patient to transmit disease is assumed to be 5 days in19 , indicating that γ = 0.2. Another evidence comes
from the study of the incubation period. The latent period (exposed but not contagious) for COVID-19 is found to
be 3.69 days on average2 and the mean incubation period (time from infection to onset of symptoms) is 5.2 days28 ,
meaning that the infectious period is around 1.5 days before the onset of symptom. The diagnostic test could take less
than one day to up to a week. We thus assume 3.5 days to get the result of a diagnostic test on average. The total
infectious period is around 5 days.
• The inverse of the number of dates for resolving case to get resolved (θ ). According to the CDC report29, for mild
and moderate symptom, the replication-competent virus has not been recovered after 10 days following symptom onset,
indicating the individuals remains infectious no longer than 10 days after symptom onset. The infectious period could
be as long as 20 days for patients with more severe illness from COVID-19 infection. Since a majority of the COVID-19
infections are mild to moderate, we assume the infectious period to be 13.5 days, and after reducing 3.5 days from onset
of the symptom to become resolving (after quarantine or hospitalization), it takes around 10 days for a resolving case to
resolved on average.
We conduct a sensitivity analysis to examine the change of the estimation in 4 different configurations.
• (Configuration 1) (γ , θ , δ ) = (0.2, 0.1, 0.0066), the default parameter set.
• (Configuration 2) (γ , θ , δ ) = (0.14, 0.1, 0.0066). The average length of infectious period changes from 5 days to
1
0.14 ≈ 7 days, whereas other parameters are held unchanged.
• (Configuration 3) (γ , θ , δ ) = (0.2, 0.067, 0.0066). The average length of resolving period changes from 10 days to
1
0.067 = 15 days, whereas other parameters are held unchanged.
• (Configuration 4) (γ , θ , δ ) = (0.2, 0.1, 0.0075). The infection fatality ratio changes from 0.66% to 0.75%, whereas
other parameters are held unchanged.
After specifying the parameters (γ , θ , δ ), the transmission rate β (t) can be obtained from algorithm 1. Figure S1 gives
result of the sensitivity analysis. First, we found the estimated death toll for 4 scenarios is almost the same (part d in Figure
S1). Extending the infectious period from 5 to 7 days (Configuration 2) increases the number of active infectious individuals
and effective reproduction number shown in part a and part c in Figure S1, respectively. Consequently, the peak of average
daily PoC SARS-CoV-2 slightly increases in the first wave, whereas the scale of increase is smaller than the change in the
effective reproduction number and active infectious individuals. The average daily PoC SARS-CoV-2 has almost no change
in other periods, indicating that the length of the average infectious period has almost no influence of our estimation on PoC
SARS-CoV-2 for most of the days.
Second, when the average length of the resolving period changes from 10 to 15 days, the peak of PoC SARS-CoV-2,
effective reproduction number, and the number of active infectious individuals increases in the first wave, whereas these
quantities remain largely unchanged for the rest of the days (part a-c in Figure S1). The result indicates that the average length
of the resolving period also barely affects the estimated characteristics of COVID-19 progression for most of the days.

Figure S1. sensitivity analysis for 4 configurations of the SIRDC model parameters. Part a-d shows the estimated effective
reproduction number, PoC SARS-CoV-2, the number of active infectious individuals, and cumulative death toll, respectively.
When the death rate increases from 0.66% to 0.75%, the effective reproduction number seems to have almost no change
(part a in Figure S1), whereas the PoC SARS-CoV-2 and the number of active infectious individuals (figure S1 part b-c) both
reduce. This is because when the death rates increase, the estimated number of individuals infected decreases, as the death
toll is observed (and thus fixed). The death rate is a key parameter to calibrate, and studies of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
antibodies based on serology tests17 can be used to estimate the death rate in each state.
In conclusion, parameter values of the average lengths of the infectious period and the resolving period barely change
the COVID-19 progression characteristics for most of the days, including the fitted death toll. On the other hand, we found
that the number of active infectious individuals and the daily PoC SARS-CoV-2 depend critically on the death rate parameter.
Further studies of prevalence would be useful for estimating the death rate parameter in different regions.

2 Algorithm of Forecast and numerical comparison
An overview of our algorithm for forecast and uncertainty assessment is given in algorithm S1, where inputs are the countylevel observed cumulative number of confirmed cases coi, j = (coi, j (1), ..., coi, j (Ti, j ))T , the county-level observed cumulative
death toll Di, j , the state-level test positive rate pi = (pi (1), ..., pi (Ti ))T , state-level confirmed cases coi = (coi (1), ..., coi (Ti ))T
and state-level death toll Di = (Di (1), ..., Di (Ti ))T .
To evaluate the performance of different approaches, we implement 7-day and 21-day forecasts on 2,277 US counties
with a training period from 21 March 2020 to 20 September 2020, and with the forecast period starting from 21 September
2020. To compare the prediction performance of different methods, we computed the rooted mean square error (RMSE), the
proportion of the observations covered in the 95% predictive interval (PCI (95%)) and length of the 95% confidence interval
(LCI (95%)), defined as follows:

D̂∗i, j := D̂i, j (Ti, j + 1), . . ., D̂i, j (Ti, j + T ∗ ) , and the uncertainty assessment of the compartments.

Step 1 Conduct a three-parameter constrained optimization treating state-level power parameter αi unknown to minimize
the loss function in equation (9) using pi , coi and Di .
Step 2 For each county, set initial values Ii, j (1) = Ri, j (1) = 1, 000, Ci, j (1) = 0 and Di, j (1) to be the observed death toll on
day 1. Find the optimized values of Ii, j (1) and Ri, j (1) to minimize equation (9).
Step 3 Simulate S = 500 samples of the observed confirmed cases sampled from the predictive distribution of a GP model
of the observed confirmed cases. For each sample, obtain the other compartments and time-dependent transmission
rate by equation (1)-(5) and algorithm 1 using the estimate of the initial values.
Step 4 Extrapolate the time-dependent transmission rate parameters from a GP model for each sample and obtain S = 500
samples of the output death toll of the SIRDC at the forecast period.
Step 5 Sample the residuals from the predictive distribution in Equation (11) in the main manuscript at the forecast period
and obtain S = 500 samples of the ensemble forecast for the death toll. Compute the mean for forecast and 95%
predictive interval to quantify uncertainty of forecast.
Algorithm S1: Ensemble forecast and uncertainty assessment.

where t∗ := (Ti, j + 1, . . . , Ti, j + T ∗ ), T ∗ = 7 and T ∗ = 21 for the 7-day forecast and 21-day forecast, respectively. A model
with small RMSE, PCI (95%) close to the nominal 95% and small LCI (95%) is precise for forecast and uncertainty assessment.

Table S1. 7-day and 21-day forecast in 2,277 US counties with training period from 21 March 2020 to 20 September 2020
and with prediction period starting from 21 September 2020. Four methods are compared. Our proposed approach that
combines the SIRDC model and a zero-mean GP to model the residuals is denoted as SIRDC+GP. Second, the death forecast
by SIRDC model is denoted as SIRDC, which contains Steps 1 and 2 in the algorithm S1 and provides point projection of the
death toll. Third, a GP with a constant mean function is denoted as GP without linear trend, which equivalently replaces the
SIRDC model of a constant mean parameter estimated by the data for each county. The fourth model, denoted as GP with
linear trend, is the same as the third method, except that the mean of GP contains a constant mean and a linear trend of time
with two linear coefficient parameters estimated from the data. The best method under each criterion is highlighted.
A comparison between our approach and the other three approaches is recorded in Table S1. Our approach (denoted in
SIRDC+GP) has the lowest RMSE among 4 methods considered herein. Approximately 95% of the held-out death toll are
covered by the 95% predictive interval by our approach, indicating our uncertainty assessment is accurate. Although other
approaches produce a shorter length of the predictive interval, the number of held-out observations in the 95% predictive
interval is smaller than ours. Therefore, combining the SIRDC model and GP for modeling the residuals may improve the
predictive accuracy for forecasting COVID-19 associated death toll at US counties, compared to the one using the SIRDC
model or the GP model alone.

Extended Data Figure S2. a-c, Simulated comparison with noise-free observations. The black circles are the solution of
the ODEs of the SIRDC model via the default numerical solver Isoda in the function ode in deSolve R package. The green
solid and dash curves are the numerical solutions from Runge–Kutta method with the 4th order integration and step size
being 1 and 0.1, respectively. The Blue solid curves are the robust estimation from algorithm 1 and red dash curves are the
estimation in9 . In the simulation with noise-free observations, we let time duration be T = 100 days, the population size
N = 107 , the initial values of 5 compartments chosen as (S(1), I(1), R(1), D(1),C(1)) = (N − 2000, 1000, 1000, 0, 0) and the
9
(t − 1) + 1) , for 1 ≤ t ≤ T . d-f, results of the simulation with noisy observations,
transmission rate β (t) = exp −0.7( T −1
which have the same interpretationas a-c. In this simulation, we set the transmission rate
9
(t − 1) + 1) + ε , for 1 ≤ t ≤ T and ε ∼ N(0, 0.04), and the other parameters are held the same as in
β (t) = exp −0.7( T−1
the noise-free simulation. The transmission rates estimated from the method F&J are truncated to be within [0,10]. The
solution from our robust estimation approach, the Isoda and the Runge–Kutta method with the 4th order and step size being
0.1 overlap for both scenarios.
