Abstract
There are several reports in India that indicate hospitals and quarantined centers are
COVID-19 hotspots. In the absence of efficient contact tracing tools, Govt. and the policymakers may not be paying attention to the risk of hospital-based transmission. To explore
more on this important route and its possible impact on lockdown effect, we developed a mechanistic model with hospital-based transmission. Using daily notified COVID-19 cases from six
states (Maharashtra, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh) and
overall India, we estimated several important parameters of the model. Moreover, we provided
an estimation of the basic (R0 ), the community (RC ), and the hospital (RH ) reproduction
numbers for those seven locations. To obtain a reliable forecast of future COVID-19 cases,
a BMA post-processing technique is used to ensemble the mechanistic model with a hybrid
statistical model. Using the ensemble model, we forecast COVID-19 notified cases (daily and
cumulative) from May 3, 2020, till May 20, 2020, under five different lockdown scenarios in
the mentioned locations. Our analysis of the mechanistic model suggests that most of the new
COVID-19 cases are currently undetected in the mentioned seven locations. Furthermore, a
global sensitivity analysis of four epidemiologically measurable & controllable parameters on
R0 and as well on the lockdown effect, indicate that if appropriate preventive measures are not
taken immediately, a much larger COVID-19 outbreak may trigger from hospitals and quarantined centers. In most of the locations, our ensemble model forecast indicates a substantial
percentage of increase in the COVID-19 notified cases in the coming weeks in India. Based on
our results, we proposed a containment policy that may reduce the threat of a larger COVID-19
outbreak in the coming days.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) was first observed in Wuhan, China and rapidly
spread across the globe in a short duration [1]. World Health Organization (WHO) declares
COVID-19 as pandemic after assessing its various characteristics [2]. As of April 29, 2020–over
three million cases and over two hundred thousand deaths due to COVID-19 is reported across
the globe [3]. In India, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on 30/01/2020 [4],

a student from Kerala studying in a university in Wuhan [5]. As of April 29, 2020–33065
confirmed cases and 1079 deaths due to COVID-19 are reported in India [6].
According to a daily monitoring report published by WHO, 22, 073 healthcare workers
across 52 countries are being tested positive to COVID-19 [7]. The report also noted that the
number provided may be an underestimation as there is no systematic reporting of infections
among the healthcare workers [7]. In India, there are several reports that indicate hospitals
and quarantined centers are COVID-19 hotspots [8; 9; 10; 11; 12]. The doctors, nurses and
other health workers are mainly vulnerable as they are in close proximity with the COVID19 patients [9; 10; 11; 12; 13]. The close relatives of the notified COVID-19 patients in the
quarantine centers may also be at risk of getting infection. In addition, those journalists who
are continuously visiting hospitals and quarantine centers to get updated reports on COVID19, may also be at risk of getting infection [14; 15]. Therefore, a significant percentage of
susceptible population in the community may be exposed to COVID-19 infection occurring
from the contacts with patents in hospitals and quarantine centers. Due to unavailability of
efficient contact tracing tools, Govt. and the policy makers may be ignoring this important
transmission route of COVID-19.
Currently there is no vaccine and effective medicine available for COVID-19. Therefore, to
break the transmission chain of COVID-19, Govt. had implemented a full nation-wise lockdown
(home quarantined the community) staring from March 25, 2020 till April, 14, 2020. However,
the large country like India with such diverse and huge population, lockdown all over the nation
may not be a very feasible and effective solution. In addition, lockdown already have a huge
impact on the Indian economy specially on the short scale industries [16; 17]. To partially
overcome this economic crisis as well reducing COVID-19 transmission, Govt. has proposed
some amendments (known as cluster containment strategy) on the lockdown rules from April
20, 2020 [18; 19]. In these revised rules, Govt. has provided some relaxation in current rules by
dividing different districts of the various states into three zones namely red (hotspot), orange
(limited human movement), and green (economic activity) depending on the number of COVID19 cases [18; 19; 20]. However, question remains whether this cluster containment strategy may
be successful in reducing COVID-19 transmission or not? If not then what may be other
alternative solutions to reduce COVID-19 transmission? These question can only be answered
by studying the dynamics and prediction of a mechanistic mathematical model for COVID-19
transmission and testing the results in real situation.
Mechanistic mathematical models based on system of ordinary differential equations (ODE)
may provide useful information regarding transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and its control.
Recently, there are several modeling studies that provide information on different effective
control measures for reducing COVID-19 transmission [21; 22; 23]. In their study, Moghdas et
al [21] developed an age-structure model on COVID-19 and projected required ICU beds for
different outbreak scenarios in USA. To improve the hospital capacity and possible containment
of COVID-19, they recommended self isolation and better hygiene practices in the community.
Using a mechanistic model, Tang et al [22] estimated the control reproduction numbers and
studied the effect of various interventions on COVID-19 transmission in China. Recently,
Sardar et al [23] provided an effective lockdown strategy to control COVID-19 transmission
in India. They recommended cluster specific lockdown policy in different parts of India for
effective reduction in transmission of COVID-19. There are some recent studies that uses
different statistical modeling techniques to provide reliable real-time forecast of COVID-19
cases [24; 25; 26]. Therefore, a combination of mathematical and statistical models may be
2

effective in determining the control measures as well providing a robust real-time forecast of
future COVID-19 cases and deaths in different parts of India and for other countries as well.
In this paper, we formulated a mechanistic model with hospital-based transmission. We
assume that COVID-19 patients from the hospitals and quarantine centers can only be in
contact with a small fraction of the susceptible population from the community. Furthermore,
we assume different transmission rates for the community and the hospital-based infection. In
the mechanistic model, we have incorporated the lockdown effect through home quarantine of a
certain percentage of susceptible population from the community. Using daily notified COVID19 cases from six states (Maharashtra, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Uttar
Pradesh) and overall India, we estimated several important parameters of the mechanistic
model. Furthermore, we estimated the basic (R0 ), the community (RC ), and the hospital (RH )
reproduction numbers for the seven locations under study. To obtain a reliable forecast of future
COVID-19 notified cases in the above mentioned locations, we used a hybrid statistical model
that can efficiently capture fluctuations in the daily time series data. BMA post-processing
technique based on DRAM algorithm is used to ensemble our mechanistic mathematical model
with the hybrid statistical model. Using the ensemble model, we forecast COVID-19 notified
cases (daily and cumulative) from May 3, 2020 to May 20, 2020, under five different lockdown
scenarios in the seven locations. To determine an effective lockdown policy, we carried out a
global sensitivity analysis of four epidemiologically measurable & controllable parameters on
the lockdown effect (number of cases reduction) and as well on R0 .
Method
We extend a previous mechanistic model [23] by considering hospital-based COVID-19 transmission (see Fig 1 and supplementary). We assume that hospitalized & notified infected population can only be in contact with a small fraction (ρ) of the susceptible population from the
community (see Table 1 and supplementary). We assume different transmission rates (β1 and
β2 , respectively) for community and hospital-based infection. As it is very difficult to detect
asymptomatic infected in the community therefore, we assume that only a fraction of symptomatic infected population being notified & hospitalized by COVID-19 testing at a rate, τ
(see Fig 1 and Table 1). Following [23], the disease related deaths are considered only for the
notified & hospitalized population at a rate δ. We incorporated lockdown effect in our model
(see Fig 1 and supplementary) by home quarantined a fraction of susceptible population
at

1
a rate l. We also assume that after the current lockdown period
= 40 days the home
ω
quarantined individuals will returned to the general susceptible population (see Fig 1 and supplementary). Moreover, we assume that the home quarantined individuals do not mixed with
the general population (see Fig 1) i.e. this class of individuals do not contribute in the disease
transmission. A flow diagram and the information on our mechanistic ODE model parameters
are provided in Fig 1 and Table 1, respectively.
Mechanistic ODE model (see Fig 1 and supplementary) we are using for this study may
be efficient in capturing overall trend of the time-series data and the transmission dynamics of
COVID-19. However, as solution of the ODE model is always smooth therefore, our mechanistic
model may not be able to capture fluctuations occurring in the daily time-series data. Several
complex factors like lockdown, symptomatic, asymptomatic, hospital transmission, awareness,
rapid testing, preventive measures, etc may influence the variations in daily COVID-19 timeseries data. Therefore, it is an extremely challenging job to fit and long term forecast using
3

this daily time-series data. To resolve this issue, we considered a Hybrid statistical model
which is a combination of five forecasting models namely, Auto-regressive Integrated Moving
Average model (ARIMA); Exponential smoothing state space model (ETS); Theta Method
Model (THETAM); Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation,
ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal components (TBATS); and Neural Network Time Series
Forecasts (NNETAR). Finally, the Hybrid statistical model and the mechanistic ODE model
(see Fig 1 and supplementary) are combined together by a post-processing Bayesian Model
Averaging (BMA) technique which we discussed later in the manuscript.
We used daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from Maharashtra (MH), Delhi (DL), Madhya
Pradesh (MP), Rajasthan (RJ), Gujarat (GJ), Uttar Pradesh (UP) and overall India (IND)
for the time period March 14, 2020 to April 14, 2020 (MH), March 14, 2020 to April 18, 2020
(DL), March 20, 2020 to April 17, 2020 (MP), March 14, 2020 to April 18, 2020 (RJ), March
19, 2020 to April 16, 2020 (GJ), March 14, 2020 to April 18, 2020 (UP), and March 2, 2020 to
April 19, 2020 (IND) for our study. As of April 29, 2020, these referred six states contributes
74% of the total COVID-19 notified cases in India [6]. Confirmed daily COVID-19 cases form
these mentioned seven locations are collected from [6]. State-wise population data are taken
from [27].
We estimated several uninformative parameters (see Table 1) of our mechanistic model (see
Fig 1 and supplementary) by calibrating our mathematical model (see Fig 1 and supplementary) to the daily notified COVID-19 cases from the seven locations MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP,
and IND respectively. As some initial conditions of our mathematical model (see Fig 1 and
supplementary) are also unknown therefore, we prefer to estimate these uninformative initial
conditions from the data (see Table S1 in supplementary). In lockdown 1.0, the Indian Govt.
has implemented a 21 days nationwide full lockdown (home quarantined the community) starting from March 25, 2020 to April 14, 2020 [28] and Govt. then extend the lockdown period up to
May 3, 2020 (lockdown 2.0) [29; 30]. Therefore, the daily COVID-19 time series data contains
the effect of with and without lockdown scenario, therefore, we prefer to use a combination of
two mathematical models (without and with lockdown) for calibration. An elaboration on the
combination technique of the mathematical models without and with lockdown (see Fig 1 and
supplementary) is provided below:
• We first use the mechanistic model without lockdown (see Eq S1 in supplementary) starting
from the first date of the daily COVID-19 data up to end of March 24, 2020 for the seven
locations MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP, and IND, respectively.
• Using values of the state variables of the model without lockdown (see Model S1 in supplementary method) onset of March 24, 2020 as initial conditions, we run the mechanistic
model with lockdown (see Fig 1 and Model S2 in supplementary) up to the end date of
the daily COVID-19 data for the seven locations MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP, and IND,
respectively.
The nonlinear least square function 0 lsqnonlin0 in the MATLAB based optimization toolbox is
called to fit the simulated and observed daily COVID-19 notified cases in those seven locations
mentioned earlier. Bayesian based 0 DRAM 0 algorithm [31] is used to sample the uninformative
parameters and initial conditions (see Table S1 and Table S2 in supplementary) of the mathematical models combination without and with lockdown (see Fig 1 and supplementary). A
details on mechanistic model fitting is provided in [32].

Calibration of the Hybrid statistical model for the mentioned seven states are done using the R package 0 f orecastHybrid0 . First, we fitted the individual models ARIMA, ETS,
THETAM, TBATS, and NNETAR by calling the functions 0 auto.arima0 , 0 ets0 , 0 thetam0 , 0 tbats0 ,
and 0 nnetar0 respectively. The results generated from each of the above models are combined
with equal weights to determine the Hybrid statistical model. Equal weight among the five
individual models are taken as it generates a robust result (see Table S4 in supplementary) for
the Hybrid statistical model [33].
Post-processing BMA technique for combining the mechanistic model (see Fig 1 and supplementary) and the Hybrid statistical model is based on 0 DRAM 0 algorithm [31]. Let, Y ODE =
{yjODE }nj=1 and Y HBD = {yjHBD }nj=1 be n simulated observations from our mechanistic ODE
model (see Fig 1 and supplementary) and the Hybrid statistical model respectively and let,
Ŷ = {yjobs }nj=1 be n observation from the data. Then
Y E = w1 Y ODE + w2 Y HBD ,

(0.1)

is our ensemble model, where, the weights w1 and w2 satisfies the constraints
∆ = {w1 , w2 ≥ 0 : w1 + w2 = 1} .
We assume w1 and w2 follows Gaussian proposal distribution. Then the error sum of square
function [31] is defined as:
SS(θ̃) =

n 
X

2
Ŷ − Y E (θ̃) .

i=1

Posterior distribution of the weights θ̃ = (w̃1 , w̃2 ) for the ensemble model (0.1) are generated
using Bayesian based 0 DRAM 0 algorithm [31] (see Table S3 and Fig S1 to S7 in supplementary).
To save the countries short-scale industries and the agricultural sectors, Indian Govt. has
proposed some amendments on current lockdown rules from April 20, 2020 [18; 19]. In these
revised rules, Govt. has provided some relaxation in current rules by dividing different districts
of the various states into three red (hotspot), orange (limited human movement), and green
(Economic activity) zones depending on the number of COVID-19 cases [18; 19; 20]. Implementation of these new rules in our mechanistic models combination (see Fig 1 and supplementary)
are based on the following assumptions:
• Lockdown rule will be relaxed from April 20, 2020 in those states where the current estimate
of the lockdown rate (see Table 2) is higher than a threshold value. This relaxation in
lockdown is based on the fact that locations where lockdown are strictly implemented
before April 20, 2020 are likely to have more impact on the economic growth.
• Lockdown rule will be more intensive from April 20, 2020 in those states where the current
estimate of the lockdown rate (see Table 2) is below a threshold value. This assumption
is made because locations where lockdown are not implemented properly before April 20,
2020 are likely to have more red (hotspot) zones.
• 50% lockdown success is taken as the threshold value for our study. Here, 50% lockdown
success in Delhi means that 50% of the susceptible population in this state is successfully
home-quarantined during the period March 25, 2020 till April 20, 2020.

• Insensitivity and relaxation in lockdown are measured in a same scale namely 10%, 20% and
30% increment or decrement on the current estimate of lockdown rate (see Table 2).
Following the above assumptions and using our ensemble model (0.1), we provided a forecast
of notified COVID-19 cases (daily and cumulative) for MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP, and IND,
respectively during May 3, 2020 till May 20, 2020. As COVID-19 notified cases are continuously
rising in these seven locations therefore, it is more likely that lockdown period will be extended
beyond May 3, 2020. Therefore, forecast using the ensemble model (0.1) during the mentioned
time duration in those seven locations are based on the following scenarios:
(A1) Using our mechanistic models combination (see Fig 1 and supplementary) and the current
estimate of the lockdown rates (see Table 2), we forecast notified COVID-19 cases up to May
20, 2020. This forecast is combined together with the results obtain from the hybrid statistical
model by using our ensemble model (0.1).
(A2) Using our mechanistic models combination (see Fig 1 and supplementary) and the
current estimate of the lockdown rates (see Table 2), we forecast notified COVID-19 cases up
to April 20, 2020. From April 21, 2020 till May 20, 2020, forecast are made using 10% increment or decrement (depending on the state) in the estimate of current lockdown rate. This
forecast is combined together with the results obtain from the hybrid statistical model by using
our ensemble model (0.1).
(A3) Using our mechanistic models combination (see Fig 1 and supplementary) and the
current estimate of the lockdown rates (see Table 2), we forecast notified COVID-19 cases up
to April 20, 2020. From April 21, 2020 till May 20, 2020, forecast are made using 20% increment or decrement (depending on the state) in the estimate of current lockdown rate. This
forecast is combined together with the results obtain from the hybrid statistical model by using
our ensemble model (0.1).
(A4) Using our mechanistic models combination (see Fig 1 and supplementary) and the
current estimate of the lockdown rates (see Table 2), we forecast notified COVID-19 cases up
to April 20, 2020. From April 21, 2020 till May 20, 2020, forecast are made using 30% increment or decrement (depending on the state) in the estimate of current lockdown rate. This
forecast is combined together with the results obtain from the hybrid statistical model by using
our ensemble model (0.1).
(A5) Using our mechanistic models combination (see Fig 1 and supplementary) and the
current estimate of the lockdown rates (see Table 2), we forecast notified COVID-19 cases up
to May 2, 2020. From May 3, 2020 till May 20, 2020, forecast are made with no lockdown (see
Eq. S1 in supplementary). This forecast is combined together with the results obtain from the
hybrid statistical model by using our ensemble model (0.1).
As, we assumed that lockdown individuals do not mixed with the general population therefore, the basic reproduction number (R0 ) with and without lockdown (see Fig 1 and supplementary) are equal [34]:
R0 =

β1 κσ
β1 (1 − κ)σ
β2 κρστ
+
+
.
(µ + σ)(γ1 + µ + τ ) (µ + γ2 )(µ + σ) (µ + σ)(δ + γ3 + µ)(γ1 + µ + τ )
6

In the expression of R0 , sum of first two term indicate the community infection occurring from symptomatic and asymptomatic infected population. The third term in R0 specify
the hospital-based COVID-19 transmission. To distinguish the community and hospital-based
COVID-19 transmission, we defined the community reproduction number (RC ), and the hospital reproduction number (RH ) as follows:
RC =

β1 κσ
β1 (1 − κ)σ
+
,
(µ + σ)(γ1 + µ + τ ) (µ + γ2 )(µ + σ)

and
RH =

β2 κρσ τ
.
(µ + σ)(δ + γ3 + µ)(γ1 + µ + τ )

Using estimated values of epidemiologically uninformative parameters (see Table 2), we estimated R0 , RC , and RH for the seven locations MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP, and IND, respectively.
Constructing an effective policy on future lockdown in a region will require some relation
between effect of lockdown (number of COVID-19 case reduction) with some important epidemiologically measurable & controllable parameters. Our mechanistic ODE model (see Fig 1
and supplementary) has several important parameters and among them measurable and controllable parameters are β2 : average rate of transmission occurring from hospitalized & notified
based contacts (it can be controllable by following WHO guidelines); ρ: fraction of susceptible
population from the community that are exposed to notified & hospitalized based contacts
(it also can be minimized by following proper guidelines from WHO); κ: fraction of infected
that are symptomatic (rapid COVID-19 testing can provide an accurate estimate); τ : notification & hospitalization rate of symptomatic infected population (it also depend on number
of COVID-19 testing). We perform a global sensitivity analysis [35] to determine the effect
of these parameters on the lockdown effect and on the basic reproduction number (R0 ), respectively. The effect of lockdown is measured in terms of differences in the total number of
COVID-19 cases occurred during May 3, 2020 till May 20, 2020 under the lockdown scenarios
(A1) and (A5), respectively. We draw 500 samples from the biologically feasible ranges of the
mentioned four parameters (see Table 1) using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) technique.
Other informative and uninformative parameters during simulation of the mechanistic model
are taken from Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCC)
and its corresponding p-value are evaluated to determine the effect of these mentioned four
parameters on the lockdown effect and the basic reproduction number (R0 ), respectively.
Results and Discussion
Testing of the three models (the mechanistic ODE model, the hybrid statistical model,
and the ensemble model) on daily notified COVID-19 cases from Maharashtra (MH), Delhi
(DL), Madhya Pradesh (MP), Rajasthan (RJ), Gujarat (GJ), Uttar Pradesh (UP), and India
(IND) are presented in Fig. 2. Based on the performance on testing data from the mentioned
seven locations, we estimated the weights (w1 and w2 ) for our ensemble model (0.1) (see Table
S2 in supplementary). Our result suggest that the mechanistic ODE model (see Fig 1 and
supplementary) displayed a better performance in RJ, UP, and IND compared to the hybrid
statistical model (see Table S2 in supplementary). For rest of the locations (MH, DL, MP, and
GJ), the hybrid statistical model has performed better than the mechanistic ODE model in
terms of capturing the trend of the time-series data (Table S2 and Table S3 in supplementary).
The ensemble model (0.1), which is derived from a combination of the mechanistic ODE (see
7

Fig 1 and supplementary) and the hybrid statistical model respectively, has provided a robust
result in all of these mentioned seven locations in terms of capturing time-series data trend (see
Fig. 2).
The estimates of uninformative parameters of the mechanistic ODE model (Fig 1 and supplementary) suggests that currently in the seven locations (MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP, and
IND) the community infection is mainly dominated by contribution from the asymptomatic infected population (Table 2). Among the seven locations, the lowest percentage of symptomatic
infection in the community is found in RJ (about 0.1%) and the highest percentage is found
in IND (about 35%) (Table 2). Our estimates suggest that currently in the seven locations
(MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP, and IND), the notification & hospitalization rate of symptomatic
infected population is about 0.2% to 23 % (Table 2). Therefore, most of the COVID-19 infections in those mentioned seven locations are currently undetected. Our result agrees with
the recent report by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) [36]. Our estimates of
the lockdown rate for MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP, and IND, respectively, suggest that lockdown
is properly implemented in the two metro cities DL and MH. Also, in overall India (IND)
lockdown is properly implemented. In these three locations (MH, DL, and IND), about 61%
to 77% of the total susceptible population may be successfully home quarantined during the
present lockdown period (Table 2). However, for rest of the locations, our results suggest that
lockdown may not be successful as about 11% to 49% of the total susceptible population may
be isolated (home quarantined) during the current lockdown period in MP, RJ, GJ, and UP,
respectively (Table 2). In the seven locations, we found that about 1% to 9% of the total susceptible populations may be exposed to hospital (notified & hospitalized population) related
contacts (Table 2). Considering the fact that estimates of the average hospital-based transmission rates for the seven locations (MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP, and IND) are very high (Table 2),
therefore, may be a significant amount of COVID-19 infection in these seven locations are currently occurring due to notified & hospitalized infected related contacts. These findings can
be further justified by analyzing the estimates of the basic (R0 ), the community (RC ) and the
hospitalized (RH ) reproduction numbers for MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP, and IND, respectively
(see Table 3). Except for the RJ, in the remaining six locations, we found that about 1%
to 16% of the total COVID-19 transmission currently occurring from notified & hospitalized
infected related contacts (see Table 3). These figures can be increased up to 43% to 69% if
proper measures are not taken in MH, DL, MP, GJ, UP, and IND, respectively, (see Table 3).
This is a worrisome situation as higher value of the hospital-based transmission rate in MH,
DL, MP, GJ, UP, and IND, respectively (Table 2), indicate that there may be super-spreading
incidents occurring from hospital-based contacts. In RJ, low contribution of RH on R0 (see
Table 3) may be due to existence of low percentage of the symptomatic infected population in
the community (Table 2) and that leads to low percentage of notified & hospitalized COVID-19
cases. For further investigation on super-spreading events, we carried a global uncertainty and
sensitivity analysis of some epidemiologically measurable and controllable parameters from our
mechanistic ODE model (Fig 1 and supplementary) namely, β2 : average rate of transmission
occurring from notified & hospitalized based contact (it can be controllable following the WHO
guidelines [37]), ρ: fraction of susceptible population that are exposed to hospital-based contact
(it can be reduced by following proper guidelines from the WHO [37]), κ: fraction of the newly
infected that are symptomatic (Rapid COVID-19 testing can provide an accurate estimate),
τ : hospitalization & notification rate of symptomatic infected population (it also depend on
number of COVID-19 testing) on the basic reproduction number (R0 ). Partial rank correlation
8

coefficients (PRCC) and its corresponding p-value suggested that all these four parameters have
significant positive correlation with R0 (see Fig. 4 and Fig. S7 to Fig.S12 in supplementary).
Furthermore, high positive correlation of ρ on R0 indicate that small increase in the percentage
of susceptible population from the community that are exposed hospital-based transmission
will leads to significant increase in COVID-19 force of infection. Considering the fact that estimated value of β2 (see Table 2) in MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP, and IND, respectively are very
high (much higher than community transmission rate), therefore, a small increase in ρ may
leads to a larger COVID-19 outbreak in those seven locations. Therefore, until and otherwise
any preventive measures are taken in these locations, a larger COVID-19 outbreak may trigger
from hospitals and quarantine centers.
Using the ensemble model (0.1), we forecast daily as well as total COVID-19 cases under five
different lockdown scenarios in MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP, and IND, respectively, from May 3,
2020 to May 20, 2020, (see Fig. 3, Table 4 and Fig. S1 to Fig. S6 in supplementary). Comparing
the projected total COVID-19 cases during May 3, 2020 to May 20, 2020, (see Table 4) with
the total observed cases [6] during March 2, 2020 till April 29, 2020, we found about two fold
increase in the total cases in MH, MP, GJ, UP, and IND, respectively. In summary, our forecast
result suggest that in the coming two weeks a significant increase in cases may be observed in
most of these locations.
To determine which epidemiologically measurable and controllable parameters are most
influencing the effect of lockdown, we carried out a global uncertainty analysis of β2 , ρ, κ, and
τ on the lockdown effect. The lockdown effect is measured in terms of differences in the total
number of COVID-19 cases during May 3, 2020 till May 20, 2020, in MH, DL, MP, RJ, GJ, UP,
and IND, respectively, under the lockdown scenarios (A1) and (A5), respectively (see method
section for details). For MH, PRCC and its corresponding p-value suggested that all these four
parameters have significant influence on the lockdown effect (see Fig. S7 in supplementary).
Furthermore, significant negative correlation of β2 , and ρ with the lockdown effect (see Fig. S7
in supplementary) suggested that only home quarantined the community may not be sufficient
to reduce COVID-19 transmission in MH. Govt. and the policy makers may also have to focus
on reducing the transmission occurring from hospital premises based on the guidelines from
the WHO [37]. For DL, PRCC and its corresponding p-value suggested that β2 , ρ, and κ are
the main parameters that are influencing the lockdown effect (see Fig. S8 in supplementary).
Moreover, significant negative correlation of β2 and ρ with the lockdown effect and as well as
significant positive correlation of κ with the lockdown effect (see Fig. S8 in supplementary)
implies that an effective lockdown policy in DL may be a combination of lockdown in the
community, contact tracing of COVID-19 cases, and with some effort in reducing hospital-based
transmission following WHO guidelines [37]. For MP, PRCC and its corresponding p-value
suggested that κ and τ have high positive correlation with the lockdown effect (see Fig. S9
in supplementary). Furthermore, ρ have significant negative correlation with the lockdown
effect (see Fig. S9 in supplementary). Therefore an effective lockdown policy in MP may be a
strict implementation of lockdown in the red and orange zones, rapid COVID-19 testing in the
community and reducing hospital-based transmission by following guidelines from WHO [37].
For RJ, PRCC and its corresponding p-value suggested that only κ have significant positive
correlation with the lockdown effect (see Fig. S10 in supplementary). No significant correlation
with hospital-based parameters may be due to existence of low percentage of the symptomatic
infected population in the community (see Table 2) and that leads to low percentage of notified
& hospitalized based COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, RJ Govt. may focused more on
9

contact tracing in the community with relaxation may be given in the Green and Orange zones
to increase the percentage of symptomatic infected in the community. For GJ, PRCC and its
corresponding p-value suggested that all these four parameters have significant influence on the
lockdown effect (see Fig. S11 in supplementary). Furthermore, significant negative correlation
of β2 , and ρ with the lockdown effect (see Fig. S11 in supplementary) indicate that only home
quarantined the community may not be sufficient to reduce COVID-19 transmission in GJ.
Govt. of GJ and policy makers may also have to focus on reducing the transmission occurring
from hospital premises based on the guidelines from the WHO [37]. For UP, PRCC and its
corresponding p-value suggested that β2 , ρ, and κ are the main parameters that are influencing
the lockdown effect (see Fig. S12 in supplementary). Moreover, significant negative correlation
of β2 and ρ with the lockdown effect and as well as significant positive correlation of κ with the
lockdown effect (see Fig. S12 in supplementary) implies that an effective lockdown policy in UP
may be a combination of lockdown (relaxation in Green zone), contact tracing in community
with effort in reducing hospital-based transmission following the WHO guidelines [37]. Finally
for IND, PRCC and its corresponding p-value suggested that β2 and ρ are the main parameters
that are most influencing the lockdown effect (see Fig. 4). Therefore, only home quarantined
the community may not be sufficient to reduce COVID-19 transmission in IND. Govt. of IND
and the policy makers may also have to focus on reducing the transmission occurring from
hospital premises based on the guidelines from the WHO [37].
Conclusion
Our analysis of the mechanistic model with hospital-based COVID-19 transmission suggest
that most of the new infections occurring in India as well most of the states are currently
undetected. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis of two epidemiologically controllable parameters from the hospital-based transmission on the basic reproduction nuber (R0 ), indicate
that if appropriate preventive measures are not taken immediately, a much larger COVID-19
outbreak may trigger due to the transmission occurring from the hospitalized & notified based
contacts. Moreover, our ensemble forecast model (0.1) predicted a substantial percentage of
increase in the COVID-19 notified cases during May 3, 2020 till May 20, 2020, (see Table 4) in
most of these locations. In Rajasthan, trend of the forecast data (see Fig S4 in supplementary)
during May 3, 2020 till May 20, 2020, is showing a decreasing trend. This is may be due to low
number of hospitalized and reported cases in this state (see Table 2). However, cases may rise
in Rajasthan if relaxation in lockdown is applied. Furthermore, trend of the forecast data in
overall India (see Fig 3) during May 3, 2020 till May 20, 2020, indicating the fact that reaching
the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic curve may be a long way ahead for India. Finally, based on our results of global sensitivity analysis of the four important epidemiologically
measurable & controllable parameters on the lockdown effect, we are suggesting the following
policy that may reduce the threat of a larger COVID-19 outbreak in the coming days:
Effective Lockdown Policy: Dividing different states into three clusters (red, orange,
and green) is well appreciated as it increases the percentage of symptomatic infection in the
community. However, more COVID-19 testing is needed as it increases the number of notified
& hospitalized cases over the states. It is much easier to reduce hospital-based transmission in
compare to community transmission. To reduce the hospitalized & notified based contacts, an
efficient disaster management team is required. They will continuously monitor the situations
10

in different hospitals and quarantine centers across India. This team must ensure that proper
safety measures are being followed based on the guidelines provided by ICMR and WHO [37].

Model without lock-down
The basic structure of our model is an extension of our earlier model [23] by considering
hospital-based transmission. As hospitalized & notified infected (H) can only contact with a
very small fraction of the susceptible class therefore, we assume the effective contact for a single
(ρS)
and ρ is the fraction of susceptible that are in contact
hospitalized & notified infected is β2
N
with the hospitalized & notified infected. We also assume that effective contact of a single
S
symptomatic (IS ) and a asymptomatic individual is same and at a rate β1 . Therefore, total
N
human population N (t) at time t is subdivided into six mutually exclusive sub-classes namely,
susceptible (S(t)), exposed (E(t)), symptomatic (IS (t)), asymptomatic (IA (t)), hospitalized &
notified (H(t)), and recovered (R(t)), respectively. Interaction between different sub-classes are
provided by the following system of differential equation:

Model with lock-down
Lock-down effect in the model (S-1) can be included by home quarantine a fraction of the
susceptible population at a rate l. This home-quarantine populations are considered as a new
subclass namely, lock-down class L. We assume that population in the lock-down compartment
are home quarantined and they do not interact with other populations. Therefore, effective
contact of a single symptomatic (IS ), asymptomatic (IA ), and hospitalized & notified infected
S
S
(ρS)
are β1

interpretations of the model (S-1) and (S-2) parameters are provided in Table 1 (see main text).
Positivity and boundedness of the solution for the Model (S-1)
In this section, we provided a proof for the positivity and boundedness of solutions of the
system (S-1) with initial conditions (S(0), E(0), IS (0), IA (0), H(0), R(0))T ∈ R6+ . We first state
the following lemma.
Lemma S1. ([39]) Suppose Ω ⊂ R×Cn is open, fi ∈ C(Ω, R), i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n. If fi |xi (t)=0,Xt ∈Cn+0 ≥
0, Xt = (x1t , x2t , ....., x1n )T , i = 1, 2, 3, ...., n, then Cn+0 {φ = (φ1 , ....., φn ) : φ ∈ C([−τ, 0], Rn+0 )}
is the invariant domain of the following equations
dxi (t)
= fi (t, Xt ), t ≥ σ, i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n.
dt
where Rn+0 = {(x1 , ....xn ) : xi ≥ 0, i = 1, ...., n}.
Proposition S1. The system (S-1) is invariant in R6+ .
Proof. By re-writing the system (S-1), we have
dX
dt

= B(X(t)), X(0) = X0 ≥ 0

B(X(t)) = (B1 (X), B1 (X), ..., B6 (X))T
We note that

|H=0 = τ IS ≥ 0,
|R=0 = γ1 IS + γ2 IA + γ3 H ≥ 0.
dt
dt
Then it follows from the Lemma S1 that R6+ is an invariant set.
Lemma S2. The system (S-1) is bounded in the region
Ω = {(S, E, IS , IA , H, R ∈ R6+ |S + E + IS + IA + H + R ≤

Proof. We observed from the system that

Hence the system (S-1) is bounded.
Local stability of disease-free equilibrium (DFE)

ε0 = (S 0 , E 0 , IS0 , IA0 , H 0 , R0 )
Π

The local stability of ε0 can be established on the system (S-1) by using the next generation
operator method. Using the notation in [34], the matrices F for the new infection and V for
the transition terms are given, respectively, by

It follows that the basic reproduction number [40], denoted by R0 = ρ(F V −1 ), where ρ is the
spectral radius, is given by

Using Theorem 2 in [34], the following result is established.
Lemma S3. The DFE, ε0 , of the model (S-1) is locally-asymptotically stable (LAS) if R0 < 1,
and unstable if R0 > 1.
Global stability of DFE
To show the global stability of ε0 , of the model (S-1), we rewrite the system (S-1) as follows
dX

= T (X, I)

(S-4)

where, X = (S, R) ∈ R2+ denotes (it components) the number of uninfected individuals and
I = (E, IS , IA , H) ∈ R4+ denotes (it components) the number of infected individuals including
27

latent, infectious, etc. ε0 = (X ∗ , 0) denotes the disease-free equilibrium of the system (S-4).
For the system (S-1), T (X, I) and G(X, I) are given as follows:

It is clear from the expression of G(X, I) that G(X, 0) = 0.
To show global stability of ε0 = (X ∗ , 0) following two condition must hold:
dX
(H1) For
= T (X, 0), X ∗ is globally asymptotically stable.
dt
(H2) G(X, I) = AI − Ĝ(X, I), Ĝ(X, I) ≥ 0 for (X, I) ∈ Ω,
where A = DI G(X ∗ , 0) is an M-matrix (the off diagonal elements are nonnegative) and Ω
is the region where model (S-1) makes biological sense.
Now, the system defined in (H1) can be written as
dS

R(t) = e−µt R(0).

As t → ∞, S(t) = Πµ , R(t) → 0. Therefore, X ∗ is globally asymptotically stable for
dt
T (X, 0).
So (H1) holds for the system (S-1). Now matrices A and Ĝ(X, I) for the system (S-1) are
given as follows:
Solving analytically this system of equation we get, S(t) =

Clearly, A is an M-matrix and as S(t) ≤ N (t) in Ω, therefore, Ĝ(X, I) ≥ 0 for (X, I) ∈ Ω.
Following [41], the below result can be stated:
Theorem S1. The DFE of the model (S-1) is globally asymptotically stable in Ω whenever
R0 < 1.
Existence of endemic equilibria
In this section, the existence of the endemic equilibrium of the model (S-1) is established.
Let us denote
k1 = µ + σ, k2 = γ1 + µ + τ, k3 = µ + γ2 , k4 = δ + γ3 + µ.
Let ε∗ = (S ∗ , L∗ , E ∗ , IS∗ , IA∗ , H ∗ , R∗ ) represents any arbitrary endemic equilibrium point (EEP)
of the model (S-1). Further, define
λ∗ =

(S-7)

Substituting the expression in (S-7) into (S-6) shows that the non-zero equilibrium of the model
(S-1) satisfy the following linear equation, in terms of λ∗ :
a0 λ∗ + a1 = 0
where
a0 = µk2 k3 k4 + κσk3 k4 (µ + γ1 ) + (1 − κ)σk2 k4 (µ + γ2 ) + τ κσk3 (µ + γ3 )
a1 = µk1 k2 k3 k4 (1 − R0 )
29

(S-8)

Since a0 > 0, µ > 0, k1 > 0, k2 > 0, k3 > 0 and k4 > 0, it is clear that the model (S-1) has a
unique endemic equilibrium point (EEP) whenever R0 > 1 and no positive endemic equilibrium
point whenever R0 < 1. This rules out the possibility of the existence of equilibrium other than
DFE whenever R0 < 1. Furthermore, it can be shown that, the DFE ε0 of the model (S-1) is
globally asymptotically stable (GAS) whenever R0 < 1.
From the above discussion we have concluded that
Theorem S2. The model (S-1) has a unique endemic (positive) equilibrium, given by ε∗ , whenever R0 > 1 and has no endemic equilibrium for R0 ≤ 1.
