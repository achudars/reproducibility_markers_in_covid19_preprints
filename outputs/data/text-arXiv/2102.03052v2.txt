Abstract

During the special period of the COVID-19 outbreak, this project investigated the driving
factors in different information diffusion modes (i.e. broadcasting mode, contagion mode)
based on the nomination relations in a social welfare campaign #手写加油接力# on
Weibo. Specifically, we mapped a nomination social network and tracked the core
communicators in both modes. Besides, we also observed the network from perspectives
such as relationships between core communicators and modularity of the whole network.
We extracted 6 homophily factors and tested them on 2 representative communities
within the largest component of the network. We found that some core communicators
distributed in a co-dependent way. At last, we supposed several explanations to the
phenomenon which can be explored in further research.
Keywords: information diffusion, social network analysis, community detection,

Introduction

Background

Under the influence of the outbreak of COVID-19, Weibo (a Twitter-like social media
platform in China) launched a charitable campaign named #手写加油接力# on Feb 3,
2020, aiming to encourage people to relay their blessing to Wuhan, China and to cheer
for the workers who are fighting on the front line of the epidemic. The participators of #
手 写 加 油 接 力 # Campaign (hereafter referred to as the Campaign) should post a
microblog on Weibo with uploading their own handwritten greeting picture, adding the
hashtag #手写加油接力# and nominating their friends by @ user ID. Those people who
are nominated by others need to pass on this relay. Half a month later, the Campaign had
4.17 billion views and more than 30 million engagements (data on February 18, 2020),
which can be understood as a successful viral campaign on Weibo.

Related works

The advent of social media has facilitated the study of information diffusion, user
interaction and user influence over social networks [1]. In many previous studies on social
media and information diffusion, the scholars mainly focused on using retweet relations
[3] [4] or follower relations [5] [1] to map and analyze the information diffusion network.
Actually, nomination is also a common method to generate social network data [2]. But

nomination networks are often used to study the homophily of intimate and small social
relationships [7]. The researches on the Ice Bucket Challenge, a campaign gained global
recognition from digital audiences as one of the most successful disease-related viral
campaigns using social media [8], also focuses on the homophily of celebrities. Few
studies have explored the different information diffusion modes (broadcasting and
contagion) in the nomination network. Therefore, our project intended to build a social
network based on the relationship of the senders and nominees in the Campaign, aiming
to explore the driving factors in the different information diffusion modes.
Our research is divided into two main directions: information diffusion mode of this
Campaign and the related content of key opinion leaders (also can be regarded as core
communicators in this study). For key opinion leaders, we pay attention to the division of
different attributes of this group and the structural mode of their collaboration.

Information diffusion mode on the Weibo platform

Previous studies have explored the diffusion characteristics of cancer education
information on the Weibo platform and found that information diffusion is driven by a
mix of the broadcast and contagion mechanisms in the retweet network [3]. At the same
time, “Out-degrees” and “in-degrees” can be regarded as the two key structural
characteristics of advertisers on social media [9].
Similarly, for this Campaign, we raise the following research question:

How Information Diffuse in Nomination Network?

RQ1. Whether the information diffusion mode of this Campaign is broadcasting or
contagion?
KOLs and their relationships on the Weibo platform

What is KOL

The definition of key opinion leaders in the sociological phenomenon and social
media is different. When we mention this term here, we mainly refer to the latter. That is
social media influencer, who has acquired or developed their fame and notability through
the Internet [20]. In this group, they can also be subdivided into Micro-celebrities (a
person famous within a niche group of users on a social media platform) and Wang Hong
(i.e. 网红, the Chinese version of the Internet stardom), etc.
KOLs in this Campaign
During the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, online social activities not only be
significant in social coordination but also played an important role in the establishment
of motivation [10]. On the one hand, the 14-day quarantine period allows people to have
more free time to participate in social media. On the other hand, people are more
attracted to celebrities, which strengthens their online social status [11]. Therefore, if
celebrities are active during the outbreak, it will inspire people to increase the possibility
of online socialization.

Meanwhile, the other groups, such as peer leaders, unverified, active, well-connected
users and medical professionals with ICT experience, they all can play an active role in
promoting SNS (social networking sites) organ donation information [12].
But in this Campaign, who are the promoters? To explore this problem, we have the
following question:
RQ2. Who strongly promoted this Campaign?

The ways and causes of KOLs collaboration in this Campaign

Homophily refers to "a contact between similar people occurs at a higher rate than
among dissimilar people." [13]. It will be easier to form homophonous ties with the same
geographic location or common hobbies between members [14]. A study on the online
venue for international expats in Denmark shows that the group manifests itself as a
community in terms of attachment to geographical location, degree of mutual
responsibility of its members, recognition of communal history pieces, and normativity
level [15]. In the previous related works on social media homophily, factors like people’s
political views [16] or ethnicity, religion, age, country, and the reasons for joining specific
social media platforms [17] are tested.
It seems to be a common phenomenon that users on social media spontaneously form
a community for some reason. Since our research is based on Weibo and the nodes in the
network are basically entertainment stars, we decided to choose age, school, occupation,

How Information Diffuse in Nomination Network?

employer, the number of followers, and if they are verified as the factors to analyze the
homophily. Then we will discuss:
RQ3. What makes Weibo KOLs form communities of different sizes?

Method

Data collection

We used the Python Web Crawler to extract the posts on Weibo that contain the
hashtag #手写加油接力#. The popularity of the Campaign has declined after half a month.
Therefore, we selected a time period from February 3 to 18, 2020. All information about
the posts were collected to our dataset: number of retweets, number of comments,
number of likes, content and pictures of posts, posting time and location. The senders’
personal profiles were also included: account name and gender, number of followers and
followings. In consideration of the complexity of the ordinary accounts, we decided to
only extract the verified account. Eventually, we obtained 13740 posts. In the process of
data cleaning, firstly, we deleted duplicated rows and then we extracted all nominees from
the text of posts that have "@" in it. Because there were many participators without
nominating others in their posts and we deleted them. As a result, a total of 4532 posts
were retained in the final dataset. Finally, we only retained two columns, the sender name
and corresponding nominees, as the source and target node for the visualization stage.

The final dataset was imported into Gephi to generate the visualization of the network. It
was a directed graph with 2256 nodes and 4310 unweighted edges.
Information diffusion mode of the Campaign

About the broadcasting mode, since the nodes with large out-degree are basically
advertisement accounts, so we decided to utilize in-degree together with timeline to
examine the broadcasting mode. We first calculated the average in-degree in the network
to illustrate the normal scale of diffusion. Then we selected the top 10 nodes with the
highest in-degree, and extracted their 1-degree egocentric network. Meanwhile, we
checked the time of their activation. So, if a node has a high in-degree and its activation
is earlier than its neighbors, we regard this node is of the broadcasting mode.
About the contagion mode, the eccentricity (i.e. the distance from a given starting
node to the farthest node from it in the network) of nodes are compared with the diameter
of the whole network. If the eccentricity is close to the diameter, we regard this node is of
the contagion mode.

Promoters of the Campaign

Since we have calculated the key indicators of both modes (i.e. the in-degree and the
eccentricity), we regard the top 10 nodes under each indicator are the promoters of the
Campaign.

KOLs’ community analysis

We first arranged the nodes into different components using Gephi by their
component ID, then we calculated the modularity class applying the algorithm proposed
by Blondel et al. [18]. We selected the communities within the largest component and
conducted portraits from 6 dimensions (i.e. age, school, occupation, employer, the
number of followers and if they are verified) of those users and tried to extract some
factors of their homophily.

Results

Figure 1 shows the whole network of the Campaign. It is a directed graph with 2256
nodes and 4310 edges. The network has 551 components and its density is 0.001. The
average in-degree of the network is 1.584, and Figure 2 shows the top 10 in-degree nodes
and their 1-degree egocentric network (the amount of neighbors are annotated below each
chart). These 10 focal nodes have 54.400 nodes connected around them in average, with
a standard deviation of 22.916. The timeline rank (i.e. the appearance rank of the focal
nodes among the egocentric network in a decreasing time order) is shown in Table 1. As
we can see, most focal modes appeared earlier than their neighbors (𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 =
0.175, 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 0.312). So, we can prove there exists the broadcasting mode in the
information diffusion of the Campaign.

Figure 3 shows the longest path in the network. Both the node size and color
correspond to the eccentricity (i.e. bigger and darker nodes have larger eccentricity). The
top 10 eccentricity are quite similar (𝑀𝑀 = 21.800, 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 0.632). The diameter of the whole

network is 23. So it can be proved that contagion mode is also obvious in the information
diffusion of the Campaign.

Table 2 illustrates the top promoters of neither mode. There is no overlap between
them, and the correlation between them is negative ( 𝑟𝑟 = −0.518 ), showing that the
relationship between the two modes are fairly negative related. Actually, among the top
10 promoters in the broadcasting mode, a half of them are celebrity themselves, while
among the top 10 promoters in the contagion mode, all of them are marketing accounts
and fan clubs.

Discussion

In the current study, we aimed to discover the information diffusion modes in the
topic of # 手 写 加 油 接 力 # on Weibo. By calculating in-degree, we discovered that
information disseminates in a broadcasting mode and we also verified that there was a
virus-like spreading mode in the network by calculating eccentricity. Then we found that
there are different KOLs in two modes. For broadcasting mode, stars were the main group
to help to achieve a greater information coverage. For contagion mode, marketing
accounts and fan clubs were the KOLs who followed the relay rules to a greater extent and
formed deeper connections. To find out how KOLs played a role in the network, we
selected several top KOLs to observe their distribution and discovered that they gathered
in different communities which could be attributed to homophily.
Besides, we also observed the relationship between different KOLs based on the
network. As KOL in the broadcasting mode, stars received in-degree edges from both fan
clubs and marketing accounts. Fan club groups always distributed around their idols to
support them in the network. Compared to fan clubs, marketing accounts didn't have such
significant preference. However, it showed that there were also specific marketing
account groups lying around specific star groups in the network. In details, there were
two kinds of distributions. The first was one group to one group. One group of marketing
accounts was corresponding to one star relay groups. For example, the marketing

How Information Diffuse in Nomination Network?

accounts lying around 杨幂-oriented corporation community only pointed to members
in the community. It interpreted that they might be in cooperation or marketing accounts
aimed to obtain more attention from the public. The second was one group to many
groups. One group of marketing accounts was corresponding to several star relay groups.
For example, a fixed group of marketing accounts interacted with both stars from the
same crew in a relay chain and stars from other exclusive relay chains. It could be
interpreted that marketing accounts might want to obtain more public attention. Another
possibility could be it was a marketing method utilized by stars. The phenomenon offered
further research insights by analyzing more connections between fixed star groups and
marketing accounts in more scenarios.
What’s more, we also observed the connection between different communities by the
modularity which indicated the dense connection within communities and sparser
connections between communities.[19] In our network, modularity was 0.892 which
indicated a very high level and showed dense interactions in the event in initial analysis.
However, combining indicators of 1848 strongly connected components and 568
communities, we found that a great amount of small size of components were included in
the same group by the algorithm [18], which revealed that many users in the event relayed
and enjoyed in a limited circle.

Conclusion

Our research found the KOLs of public welfare relay activities on Weibo. It provides
ideas for the development and communication of such activities in the future. According
to the communication effect needed to be achieved, find the corresponding KOL, attract
more attention and participation, and transfer love and positive energy.
We need to acknowledge there are some limitations in the study. First, we only
focused on the influence of one relay event in the public welfare area and there was no
comparison between events to draw a general conclusion. Second, we only made analysis
on the specific social media of Weibo which may be not applicable in other social medias.
More comparison researches between public welfare relay events on different social
medias can be a further research direction.
