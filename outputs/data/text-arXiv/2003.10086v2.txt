We analyze the spread of COVID-19 by considering the transmission of the disease among individuals both within and between regions. A set of regions can be defined as any partition of
a population such that travel/social contact within each region far exceeds that between them.
COVID-19 can be eliminated if the region-to-region reproductive number —i.e. the average number
of other regions to which a single infected region will transmit the virus—is reduced to less than
one. We find that this region-to-region reproductive number is proportional to the travel rate between regions and exponential in the length of the time-delay before region-level control measures
are imposed. Thus, reductions in travel and the speed with which regions take action play decisive
roles in whether COVID-19 is eliminated from a collection of regions. If, on average, infected regions
(including those that become re-infected in the future) impose social distancing measures shortly
after active spreading begins within them, the number of infected regions, and thus the number of
regions in which such measures are required, will exponentially decrease over time. Elimination will
in this case be a stable fixed point even after the social distancing measures have been lifted from
most of the regions.

The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the
novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in
Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1] and has since
become a severe pandemic [2]. Understanding the
dynamics of disease transmission both within and
between regions can provide insight into how to
eliminate the outbreak [3–8]. While the assumptions of all models fail to describe the details of
complex real-world systems, these systems may
possess large-scale behaviors that do not depend
on all these details [9–11]. For COVID-19, the parameters for these large-scale behaviors depend
on the scale of the description (e.g. the size of
the regions) and include the average size of an
outbreak within a region and the transmissibility of the outbreak between regions. The values
of these two parameters, both of which can be
controlled with interventions, determine whether
the multi-region behavior of the epidemic is that
of exponential spread until saturation (e.g. herd
immunity) or exponential decay until elimination.
We find that reductions in travel and the speed
with which regions take action play decisive roles
in whether COVID-19 is eliminated from a collection of regions. If, on average, infected regions
(including those that become re-infected in the
future) impose control measures shortly after active spreading begins within them, the number
of infected regions, and thus the number of regions in which such measures are required, will
exponentially decrease over time.
A central concept in the study of disease spread is the
reproductive number, i.e. the average number of people to whom an infected individual will transmit the disease [12]. Outbreaks can be stopped if interventions re-

duce this reproductive number to less than one. Here,
we consider the analogous region-to-region reproductive
number R∗ [13, 14], defined as the average number of
other regions (including those that have been previously
infected) to which a single infected region will transmit the infection. Our analysis applies to a set of regions defined as any partition of a population such that
travel/social contact within each region far exceeds that
between them (e.g. the U.S. could be partitioned by state
or commuting zone boundaries). For the purposes of interventions, treating larger areas as single regions means
that social distancing measures will be homogeneously
applied to larger areas but also means that it is easier to
achieve lower travel rates between such areas. The coronavirus can be eliminated if regions that become infected
contain the coronavirus rapidly enough for R∗ < 1 to be
achieved.
The disease is modeled as being transmitted among individuals within a region, with travel allowing the disease
to spread between regions. We define a region as infected
if someone with the infection enters the region. Conditioning on region c being infected, we let Nc be a random
variable (that could be zero) denoting the total number of
infections that occur in region c from the time of infection
to the time at which the virus is eliminated or contained.
Let pc be the probability that an infected individual in
region c will travel to another region during the period in
which that individual is contagious. Then, the region-toregion reproductive number for region c—which we define
as the expectation of the number of regions that region c
will infect if it becomes infected—is R∗c = E[Nc ]pc .1 R∗c
may differ from region to region, but if the interventions

We note that if region c were infected multiple times, E[Nc ] would
be higher than if it were infected once, but it is assumed that
infecting an already infected region will on average contribute
no more to disease spread than infecting a currently uninfected
region. Thus, like the basic reproductive number, this region-

FIG. 1. A collection of geographic regions can exist in one
of two regimes with respect to COVID-19. If the virus is
eliminated from currently infected regions, the question then
becomes whether or not this elimination is stable. The stability of elimination depends on (1) the average total number
of cases that will result from the disease being transmitted
to a region, which in turn depends on (among other factors)
how quickly regions locally lock down if they are infected or
re-infected, and (2) the probability that an infected individual in one region will infect an individual in another, which
in turn depends on the rate of travel between regions.

are sufficiently fast and strong such that R∗ , the average
value of R∗c over a set of regions with each region weighted
by its probability of being infected [12], is less than one,
then the outbreak will not be self-sustaining within that
set of regions. Put another way, a set of regions can exist
in one of two regimes: a regime for which elimination is
a stable fixed point of the system and a regime for which
it is unstable (see fig. 1). A change in policy can shift a
collection of regions from the unstable regime (R∗ > 1)
to the stable regime (R∗ < 1) or vice versa. Although
the values of Nc for a set of regions could currently be
high, the current value of R∗ is determined by E[Nc ] and
pc for the regions that will be infected or re-infected in
the future after social distancing has eliminated the virus
from currently infected regions.
We now describe a simple model to estimate Nc , not
to provide a precise description of the epidemic trajectory but rather to clarify how various interventions may
affect outbreak size. The one key assumption is that the
reproductive number within individual regions can be re-

to-region reproductive number overestimates the disease spread
away from the limit of most regions being uninfected by counting
a region that has been infected multiple times during a single
outbreak as multiple regions being infected. We also note that,
as in SIS compartmental models, an infected region for which
the virus is contained can later be re-infected.

FIG. 2. The number of active infections in a region as a
function of time. After time Tc , aggressive social distancing
measures are implemented. They must remain in place for a
duration greater than τc (rc Tc + ln ic0 ) (see eq. (2)). Thus, the
longer the region waits to enact the measures, the longer the
total amount of time they must remain in place.

duced below one with sufficiently strong social distancing
measures, as suggested by empirical evidence (see below).
Let ic0 be a stochastic factor that roughly corresponds
to the initial foothold that the virus gains in region c
conditioning on an infected individual entering the region, with ic0 = 0 corresponding to the case in which no
one was infected or a few people were infected but the
outbreak was contained by contact tracing/quarantine
or otherwise spread no further. If the outbreak is contained (ic0 = 0), then the number of active infections
remains at zero for the purposes of this model because—
by definition—the outbreak has no chance of spreading to
other regions. If the outbreak is not contained (ic0 6= 0),
the number of active infections is modeled as growing
with time t at an exponential rate erc t . After time Tc (the
delay in response), the region implements aggressive social distancing measures that cause the number of active
infections to decay as e−t/τc .2 Such exponential decrease
will occur if the aggressive social distancing measures,
together with testing, contact tracing, and quarantine,
can reduce the reproductive number (R) of the virus below one. The greater the reduction in R, the smaller the
value of τc and thus the faster the decrease in infections.3

The assumption of exponential increase followed by exponential
decay after intervention assumes that the proportion of susceptible individuals is roughly constant, i.e. that the region intervenes
before a significant fraction of its population is infected, which is
the regime with which we are concerned. (To the extent that this
assumption does not hold, its use will result in an overestimate
of the number of infected individuals and thus does not affect
our main conclusions.)
R
For R < 1, R is related to τc by 1 = 0∞ Rg(t)et/τc dt where g(t)
is the distribution of generation intervals [15].

3
The number of active infections in region c as a function of time (see fig. 2) can therefore be written as:
(
ic erc t
t ≤ Tc
ic (t) = 0c rc Tc −(t−Tc )/τc
(1)
i0 e
e
t ≥ Tc
The social distancing measures can be lifted once no
active infections remain in the region or once all active
infections have been contained. Solving for ic (t) = 1
(assuming ic0 6= 0) yields an approximate duration for
the social distancing measures of
τc (rc Tc + ln ic0 )

(2)

As the number of cases becomes increasingly small, contact tracing may become increasingly effective and hasten
the drop of ic (t) to zero. The probability that the number of infections will rebound after the social distancing
measures are lifted—in which case an additional phase of
such measures will be needed, as in the Imperial College
report [16]—will depend on the probability of importation from other regions, which in turn will depend on the
region-to-region reproductive number R∗ . Even though
the virus can be re-imported, as long as R∗ < 1 the number of infected regions will on average decrease over time,
since re-importation events are included in R∗ .
Each infected region c infects a currently uninfected
region with a probability rate proportional to the number of active infections ic (t) times the probability rate pc
that an infected individual will travel to an uninfected
region. The number of new infected regions spawned
by region c can thus be modeled as a Poisson process
with rate ic (t)pc . This modeling assumption overestimates the spread of the disease to new regions by counting a single new region that has been infected multiple times as multiple new infected regions. Note that
a single new region that is infected by more than one
other region is also counted as multiple new infected regions. The smaller the number of regions infected and
the smaller the probability of one region infecting another, the smaller the probability that the same region
will be infected twice. Nonetheless, for certain network
connectivities, this model may overestimate R∗ . (Our
main conclusions are unaffected because R∗ will be less
than one if its overestimate is.)
Let pc0 be the per capita probability rate before time
Tc of individuals in region c traveling to other regions
and pc1 be the probability rate afterwards (pc1 will be less
than pc0 if travel is discouraged and/or restricted at the
time social distancing measures are implemented). The
number of new regions that are infected by region c will
then be a Poisson random variable with a mean of

In order to better understand the extent of the measures required to achieve R∗ < 1, we estimate the values
of the parameters in eq. (5) (see fig. 3 and Methods) in
order to determine R∗c as a function of the time-delay
before aggressive social distancing measures are enacted,
as shown in fig. 4. Note that the time-delay is measured from the time at which exponential growth begins
to occur—which could be as early as the first infection
transmitted within the region—not the time at which exponential growth is first measured.
Reducing R∗ to less than one will stop the outbreak,
and if R∗ is already less than one, further reducing R∗
will increase the speed at which the outbreak is stopped.
Since R∗ is proportional to both E[Nc ] and the travel
rates between regions, any intervention that reduces the
sizes of outbreaks within regions and/or travel between
them will also reduce R∗ . In the language of eq. (5):
• A reduction in travel from region c results in a linear reduction in R∗c through pc0 and pc1 .
• Improvements in testing, contact tracing, and quarantine reduce R∗c through E[ic0 ], rc , and τc .
• The preemptive reduction of large events such as
conferences (as well as general social distancing)
reduces the probability of a super-spreader event
as well as general transmission, reducing both E[ic0 ]
and rc .
• Reductions in rc Tc not only exponentially reduce
R∗c (as well as the total number of infections within
the region) but also linearly reduce the amount of
time for which the social distancing measures must
remain in place.
• Augmenting social distancing measures (after time
Tc ) decreases τc , which results in a linear decrease
in both R∗c and the time for which the distancing
measures must remain in place.
We conclude with a few comments. First, without
the timely implementation of aggressive social distancing
measures, restricting travel from infected regions serves
only to delay the spread of the outbreak, as found in other
studies [19–25]. However, when a reduction in travel is
coupled with social distancing measures, the travel reduction will not only delay the spread of the outbreak but in
some cases will also be the determining factor in whether
or not the outbreak is eliminated. (If R∗ < 1 can be
achieved without reducing travel, travel reductions can
greatly decrease the duration and total case count of the
outbreak by further reducing R∗ .) Empirically, travel restrictions, when combined with other sufficiently strong

China by date that these patients self-reported as the onset
of their symptoms. The best OLS linear fits to the natural
log of the number of cases are shown: For Jan. 11-23 (up
until the lockdown), the slope (in units of day−1 ) is 0.228
(R2 = 0.991, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.214, 0.242]),
which corresponds to a doubling time of 3.04 days. For Feb. 25 the slope is −0.145 (R2 = 0.999, 95% CI [−0.160, −0.131]),
which corresponds to a halving time of 4.78 days. Data are
from ref. [17], which includes cases diagnosed through Feb.
11. Not pictured: There is a drop in cases with onsets of
symptoms after Feb. 5, likely due to many of those cases
being diagnosed after Feb. 11. It should be noted that the
number of cases by date of diagnosis (not pictured) continues
to increase through Feb. 4, indicating that in general the date
of diagnosis substantially lags the date of onset of symptoms,
which itself lags the date of infection. Thus, a considerable
amount of time can pass before even an immediate decrease
in the infection rate can be observed.

Mar. 13 - Apr. 5. The change in the exponential growth rate
from 0.262 to 0.123 likely occurred due to partial measures
implemented by Italy, but it was not until a nationwide lockdown was implemented on March 9 that exponential growth
changed to exponential decline. The rate of decline is much
slower in Italy than in China, perhaps due to China’s stronger
lockdown enforcement and contact tracing/quarantine measures.

to which region c will transmit the disease) on Tc (the timedelay before the social distancing measures are enacted). If
R∗ (a weighted average of R∗c ) is less than one, the number
of infected regions will exponentially decrease and the disease
will be eliminated (and the smaller R∗ is, the faster it will
be eliminated); otherwise, the number of infected regions will
increase until saturation.

interventions, have been predicted [25] and found [26] to
substantially curb the COVID-19 epidemic.
Second, because R∗c depends exponentially on Tc , the
longer a region waits to take aggressive social distancing
measures, the more important it becomes to act without delay. It is important to note, however, that there
is no advantage to delaying at all. Immediately implementing aggressive social distancing measures as soon as
there is evidence of the disease spreading within the region will not only reduce the total amount of time for
which such measures must remain in place but will also
exponentially reduce the probability of infecting or reinfecting another region. Practically speaking, all regions
within which the virus is spreading must implement and
maintain control measures until the virus has been eliminated or contained. If the virus is then re-imported into
a locale, sufficiently strong interventions should be implemented in a region around that locale that is large enough
such that the per capital rate of travel out of that region
is sufficiently low (e.g. predominantly by flight). Practically, this may involve locking down regions the size of
commuting zones (which may span multiple states), and
possibly entire states. Per capita travel between regions
does not have to be zero, but it must be small (the precise

5
value depends on the parameters in eq. (5); fig. 4 gives a
rough estimate of what is necessary).
Finally, just as transmission within a region is an exponential process for which the need for immediate action is
not always apparent, the transmission between regions is
also such an exponential process. At first the number of
infected regions is deceptively small, but without rapid
action this number exponentially grows. The sooner a
set of regions decides to adopt a protocol that reduces
R∗ below one, the shorter the amount of time between
the adoption of the protocol and the elimination of the
disease.

METHODS

In this section we estimate the parameters in eq. (5)
for COVID-19.
The doubling time of the epidemic can vary from location to location and depends on pre-lockdown interventions (see e.g. the change in the growth rate for Italy in
fig. 3), but using the number of confirmed cases in China
by date of symptom onset (rather than by date of diagnosis) [17] yields a doubling time of 3.04 days in the period
leading up to the Jan. 23 lockdown, which corresponds
to r = 0.228 day−1 (fig. 3).4
From this growth rate in China before the Jan. 23
lockdown, the basic reproductive number R0 (which also
varies by location) can be calculated from the distribution of generation intervals [15].5 Empirical data from

Some studies estimated the doubling time for COVID-19 at approximately 7 days [27, 28], but even a 5 day doubling period
is implausibly long, given that in various countries, even with
some preventative measures, the number of infections has increased by far more than a factor of 64 over 30 days [29]. Part
of the difficulty in estimating the doubling time from the initial
period of transmission is that ‘super-spreader’ events may play
an important role in the transmission process. The presence
of super-spreader events indicates that the transmission process
may be fat-tailed and therefore standard statistical approaches
may underestimate the rate of spread when the total number of
cases is still small [30].
Empirically, we generally observe the distribution of serial intervals (the times between the onsets of symptoms in two successive
cases in a transmission chain) rather than the distribution of generation intervals (the times between two successive infections in a
transmission chain). The means of the two distributions should,

various sources support a distribution of generation intervals with a mean of approximately 4.0 to 4.7 days [31–
36], which yield upper bounds of R0 < e4.0r = 2.5
to R0 < e4.7r = 2.9. These upper bounds assume all
transmission occurs at the mean generation interval; the
spread of generation intervals given a fixed mean results
in lower values for R0 given a fixed r (or higher values for
r given a fixed R0 ). For instance, the serial interval data
with a mean of 4.7 days best fit a lognormal distribution
(S.D.=2.9 days) [31], which yields R0 = 2.5.6 This short
mean generation time of 4.0 to 4.7 days may explain the
difficulty in containing the virus through contact tracing
alone.
The values of τc that can be achieved depend on the
effectiveness of the social distancing measures. The data
from China (see fig. 3) indicate a halving time of as few
as 4.78 days is achievable, which corresponds to τ = 6.9
days. However, as a more conservative estimate, we use
the data from Italy, which yield τ = 15 days.
E[ic0 ] is the expected “effective” number of people
an infected traveler will infect while visiting region c,
taking into account containment efforts.7 We estimate
E[ic0 ] = R0 ; the degree to which E[i0c ] differs from R0 depends on how likely a typical traveler is to transmit the
virus relative to a typical resident, as well as on the effectiveness of contact tracing and other containment efforts.
The value of pc depends on the frequency of travel out
of region c. As previously noted, there is some choice
in how to model the partition of a population into a set
of regions. In general, the larger the regions, the lower
the frequency of per capita travel out of them but the
more homogeneous the application of the social distancing measures. Since pc is smaller for larger regions and
Nc is not strongly affected by the size of regions, R∗ will
be lower if larger regions are chosen, but at the cost of the
social distancing measures being applied over larger areas for each new outbreak. Considering a set of regions
within the U.S. that are large enough such that travel
between the regions is predominantly by flight yields a
per capita travel rate of 0.004 flights out of a region per
person per day.8

however, be the same.
This value was obtained by approximating the generation interval distribution by the serial interval distribution. The value is
consistent with some previously reported R0 values that were
based on a mean generation interval overestimated as approximately that of SARS (8.4 days)/MERS (7.6 days) [37] because
the doubling time was also overestimated by a similar factor.
For instance, if the outbreak is contained such that exponential
growth never occurs, the effective number of people infected by
the traveler is zero, even if the traveler did infect some individuals
in region c.
This estimate is obtained by dividing the 1.01 billion total passengers traveling by plane to, from, or within the U.S. in 2018 [38]
by the 2018 U.S. population and the number of days in 2018, and
then also dividing by 2 so that only flights out of and not into a
region are counted. Using this estimate for pc0 assumes that the
probability that an infected individual will travel equals that of
the general public.
