Abstract: Covid-19 has been started in the year 2019 and imposed restrictions in many
countries and costs organisations and governments. Predicting the number of new cases and
deaths during this period can be a useful step in predicting the costs and facilities required in
the future. The purpose of this study is to predict new cases and death rate for seven days ahead.
Deep learning methods and statistical analysis model these predictions for 100 days. Six
different deep learning methods are examined for the data adopted from the WHO website.
Three methods are known as LSTM, Convolutional LSTM, and GRU. The bi-directional mode
is then considered for each method to forecast the rate of new cases and new deaths for
Australia and Iran countries. This study is novel as it attempts to implement the mentioned
three deep learning methods, along with their Bi-directional models, to predict COVID-19 new
cases and new death rate time series. All methods are compared, and results are presented. The
results are examined in the form of graphs and statistical analyses. The results show that the
Bi-directional models have lower error than other models. Several error evaluation metrics are
presented to compare all models, and finally, the superiority of Bi-directional methods are
determined. The experimental results and statistical test show on datasets to compare the

proposed method with other baseline methods. This research could be useful for organisations
working against COVID-19 and determining their long-term plans.

1. Introduction
Serious Intense Respiratory Disorder Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a novel zoonotic
microorganism [1]. It is liable for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2]. Corvids are a
massive gathering of infections that follow respiratory and neurological frameworks [3]. In
2003 and 2012, two kinds of these infections, called SARS coronavirus (SARS-COV) and
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus were introduced. The World Health
Organization (WHO) and the worldwide countries affirmed the Covid-19 illness to be very
infectious [4]. The COVID-19 pandemic has been broad as an open-being crisis of universal
concern, and widespread has forced an overwhelming burden on worldwide well-being and
medical organisations [5].
The spread rate of Covid-19 has expanded day by day in numerous nations, particularly in
United States America [6], Spain [7], Italy [8], Germany [9], United Kingdom [10], France
[11], and Iran [12]. Estimating the prevalence of coronavirus is one of the problems in later
times. Determining the pandemic with tall exactness offer assistance to distinctive nations
arrange a plan to battle a fight against the infection spread preparatory logical reports
uncovered that COVID-19 would be conceivably spread by means of creatures to people, but
the current discoveries state that humans to the human transmission seem to happen through
coordinate contact, and respiratory bead [13].
More than 800,000 persons are detailed to be positive each day from nations worldwide
[14]. The foremost challenging angle of its spread is that an individual can have the infection
for numerous days without appearing side effects [5]. The causes of its prevalence and caring
about its danger, nearly all the nations have announced either fractional or strict closing all
through the influenced locales and cities [5]. With the “stay at home” decree and administrative
bodies are beginning to move toward routine control and reaction strategies, such as isolation
and social removing [15].
The world pandemic also has a very substantial impact on environmental issues as a
substantial increase of single-use plastics [16], problems with waste [17] and especially toxic

waste [18] and also both ways impact on energy generation and use and related increase of
several environmental footprints [19]. A key issue is minimising the negative impacts on
society and industry with a post-pandemic perspective in mind [20].
Medical analysts worldwide are now included to find a fitting antibody and solutions for
the infection. Since there is no affirmed pharmaceutical until presently killing the infection, all
nations’ governments are centred on the safeguards that can stop the spread [5]. There have
only been a modest bunch of case-control and cohort thinks about approximately COVID-19
mortality [21]. This has come about in destitute COVID-19 mortality forecast identification.
Subsequently, a detailed review of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS studies with mortality results
give a point of view for understanding the clinical, research facility, and imaging highlights of
COVID-19 [21].
Machine Learning (ML) has demonstrated itself as a specific research field over the final
decade by understanding numerous exceptionally complex and advanced real-world issues
[22]. The usage zones included nearly all the factual world spaces such as healthcare, cleverly
robots [5]. One of the foremost critical ranges of ML is estimating [23]. In this research, the
number of new cases and new deaths are predicted using machine learning techniques and
discussing some deep learning methods. Various articles and methods have been modelled to
predict mortality in one day. In this article, the mortality rate and new cases in three days and
seven days using bi-directional methods are modelled. The main objective of the study is to
forecast the number of new cases and new deaths from 1 day to the next seven days. This paper
includes six sections. Section 1 forwards the introduction, and section 2 contains related works
used in this study. Section 3 introduces the description of the dataset and methods. Section 4
gives the experimental results, section 5 discusses results, and section 6 renders the conclusion
and future works.
2. Literature review
The literature review section is related to previous research and scientific explanations.
Section 2.1 deals with related work done in the past. In Section 2.2, deep learning is briefly
introduced. Sections 2.3 to 2.6 provide a scientific introduction to LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and ConvLSTM techniques following previous research, respectively. It also explains how each of these
methods works. Figure 1 summarises the literature review structure.

Figure 1: Structure of the literature review
2.1 Related Works
New case rates and the latest death rate of most diseases have been done frequently,
whereas the spread of infectious diseases is not too popular. This section examines similar
research and also discusses the required scientific definitions of the following sections.
Pinter et al. [24] proposed the number of contaminated people and the mortality rate by
employing a hybrid machine learning approach. The hybrid machine learning strategies of
Adaptive Network-based Fluffy Induction System (ANFIS) and Multi-layered PerceptronImperialist Competitive Calculation (MLP-ICA) are utilised to anticipate time arrangement.
The approval of the result is approximately nine days which affirms the model exactness. It is
expected that the show keeps up its accuracy as long as no significant intrusion happens. The
paper is an introductory benchmarking to illustrate the potential of machine learning for future
investigation.
Burke et al. [6] illustrated the ML capability of the model to figure the number of persons
influenced by COVID-19 and the number of passing. They confronted various analysts who
were examining the distinctive measurements of the widespread and create the results to assist
humankind. Four famous determining models, such as Linear Regression (LR), Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Exponential
Smoothing (ES) were utilised in their study [6]. Their results showed that their proposed
method had the best performance among other similar methods. These results can be beneficial
for similar research.
Yuan et al. [25] displayed the determining methods that survey the past circumstances to
enable better expectations around the circumstance to happen within the future. Predicting has
been exerted based on different estimating strategies and diverse information sources. It
categorised estimating methods into two sorts. Specifically, stochastic theory numerical models
and data mining/machine learning strategies came with their problems (technical and generic)
such as the need for legitimate information, demonstrate complexity. Their method showed the
challenges of different estimating models and valuable suggestions for the control of this

pandemic. Forecasting techniques can be calculated using deep learning from collected data
which is not done in this work.
Dowd et al. [26] proposed age and gender on the passing number utilising numerical
modelling. It has been watched that this infection is generally influencing the aged. In this
condition, the age structure of a specific nation plays a desperate part. Thus the approaches like
social distancing and isolation can offer assistance to moderate down and stop the prevalence
of the illness. The outcomes are classified as agreeing to the age group of individuals in several
nations.
Arun and Iyer [27] displayed the examination of the prevalence of COVID-19 infection
and anticipated the measure of the pandemic and mortality rate. They utilised machine learning
procedures and numerical modelling methods such as Polynomial Regression, Bayesian Edge
and long short-term memory. Polynomial Regression was utilised to anticipate the number of
deaths for the 15 nations, and the precision achieved in this case was 85.14%.
Repaka et al. [28] proposed research on anticipating heart illnesses’ deaths utilising
classification by Naive Bayesian classifier. They have moreover utilised progressed coding
methods to secure the individual data of sicks. The reported exactness is 84.07% for
classification and 98.2% for the security of data.
Bonanad et al. [29] analysed the accessible information of mortality in the older grown-up
population compared with its more youthful partners. This study performed a meta-analysis in
line with proposals from the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for
Precise Surveys and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Articulation. The result is that the most
elevated mortality rate was watched in patients matured 80 y. All age bunches essentially
higher mortality than the promptly younger age gathers, and older grown-up patients should be
prioritised within preventive measures.
A study conducted by Zeroual et al. [30] was based on day by day affirmed and improved
cases prepared from six nations and proposed a deep learning system for COVID-19 time series
determining. Five in-depth neural network strategies to figure the number of new cases and
recovered cases had been considered with the estimating horizon of 17 days. Particularly, basic
Repetitive Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-directional LSTM
(Bi-LSTM). Results illustrate the significant potential of a deep neural network in detecting
COVID-19 cases. The main purpose of this study was to investigate deep learning methods for
the number of deaths with limited information. The deep learning models can take time-variant
properties and significant past information designs and estimate COVID-19 time-series
information's future inclination. The results show that the Variational Auto Encoder (VAE)

model performed better than other models. This article does not provide a detailed review of
Bi-directional models for the next 1 to 7 days.
Sagheer et al. [31] proposed a deep learning method to solve conventional predicting
approaches’ impediments. The issue was that finding a successful strategy to show the process
in time series datasets proceeds to be a long time unsolved issue with various potential
programs [32]. Their method was a deep architecture of the LSTM, signifying it as Delayed
Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM). The precise expectation and learning execution
demonstrated that the proposed deep LSTM model and other deep learning techniques are
qualified to be connected to the non-linear prediction issues within the petroleum industry. The
DLSTM method had better performance in comparison with other standard approaches. Table
1 is a summary of related works.

2.2 Deep Learning
Deep Learning (DL) is famous for releasing high-level abstract highlights from a huge sum of
crude information without depending on earlier information, which is possibly appealing in
predicting time series [32]. This research introduces a DL system for the COVID-19 time series
determining. DL may be a sort of machine learning strategy that enables computers to
memorise program and information without express the programming process and extricate
valuable patterns from crude information. Deep learning solves representational issues by
developing a few basic highlights to represent a complex concept [25].
Deep neural networks are made from artificial neural systems. Artificial neural systems, as a
rule, contain many layers (shallow). However, deep neural networks contain more covered up
(deep) layers. With more layers, deep neural systems are competent in learning huge data [34].
Deep learning is fulfilled by a few non-linear processing layers that endeavour to represent the
information progressively. Since deep learning models are actualised as Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) where inputs and outputs are modifiable for each issue, they can adjust to
special problems with non-standard traits or other barriers for common learners. In any case,
this implies that numerous parameters and hyperparameters ought to be s optimised, which
involves a few challenges that are still experiencing intense research [22].
The following is an introduction to some of the DL methods used to predict time series namely
LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) and Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU).
2.3 Long Short Term Memory
LSTM could be a specific structural sort of Recurrent Neural Network technique, which
includes three control neurons (cells) of input, output, and forgetting gates. Upon entering the
data into the model, the weights of the neurons are applied to the input data. The data that does
not accommodate will be forgotten. This guideline can solve the long sequence dependency
issue in neural networks by progressing the covered up layer structure. In numerous issues,
LSTM has been very fruitful and broadly utilised, such as highway path forecast [35], stock
price forecast [36], and air pollution forecast [37].
LSTM may be a modern gated memory unit planned to relieve the vanishing gradient issues
restricting the proficiency of a simple Recurrent Neural Network [38]. LSTM networks are

very profitable for learning sequences with longer-term designs of unknown length [39] being
able to keeping up long memory. The LSTM was introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber
[38] and has moved forward and advanced by Graves [40]. LSTM is planned to combine the
short-term and long-term temporal data and shows superior time series forecast execution. In
this manner, LSTM is competent in learning long term conditions. LSTM has a chain-like
structure having four neural organise layers collaboration with each other. The LSTM has three
gates, specifically the forget gate, input gate, and output gate [41]. LSTM networks utilise an
upgraded form of RNN, which makes it less demanding to keep in mind past information in
memory [42]. The major advantage of utilising LSTM is that it is a suitable procedure to
classify, handle, and predict time series models having different lag durations. The desirable
characteristic of LSTM is its expanded capacity to capture long-term conditions and incredible
capacity to handle time-series information [30]. LSTM realises temporal memory function
through the switch of the gate, and can viably explain the issue of gradient vanishing and blast
in a repetitive neural network [33].
2.4 Bi-directional LSTM
A Bi-LSTM network is an upgraded model of the LSTM [30]. Bi-LSTM has been effectively
utilised in natural language preparation and image processing [37]. The Bi-LSTM model
extricates historical information highlights in two directions, so it is superior to a single LSTM
when handling time-series information. Bi-LSTM applies the standard LSTM network to
calculate the input information in successive and invert order to get two diverse external states
and get the ultimate result through a completely associated layer [44]. The Bi-LSTM is efficient
for circumstances needed content entrance. The technique has been broadly utilised in
classification, particularly in content classification [45], sentiment classification [46], and
speech classification and recognition [47].
2.5 Convolutional LSTM
The real LSTM faces an issue named gradient vanish that can be solved by a different
architecture of LSTM called Convolutional LSTM [48]. LSTM, as an extraordinary Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) structure, has demonstrated steady and powerful for modelling longrange dependencies in different studies [49]. However, it contains as well much redundancy
for spatial information. Convolutional LSTM replaces the completely associated gate layers of
the LSTM with convolutional layers to address this issue. Conv-LSTM can encode Spatio-

temporal data in its memory cell [50]. Subsequently, by supplanting the convolution operators
with an LSTM memory cell, the Conv-LSTM can know what data is to be ‘remembered’ or
‘forgotten’ from the past cell state, utilising its disregard gate. Essentially, the Conv-LSTM
also chooses what data is to be stored within the display cell state [51].
2.6 Gated Recurrent Unit
GRU is an improved structure of LSTM. Its input gates and output gates have been updated
[52]. There were two gates in GRU, upgrade and reset gates, rather than three gates in LSTM.
The proposition of the reset and update gates concepts are among the new benefits brought by
GRUs models. The upgrade gate gives the amount of already kept memory, and the reset gate
guarantees the mixture way between new inputs (actuals) and past memory [36].
3. Method
In this section, the methods used in this research are introduced. Section 3.1 describes the main
strategy of the paper. Section 3.2 introduces the datasets used in this research. In section 3.3,
implemented methods in this research, performance, architecture and implementation details
are stated.
3.1. Research Map
This section clarifies the proposed models in detail. At first, the dataset is briefed, which have
gotten from the WHO website [53]. At that point, DL methods of the new cases and the new
death rate of COVID-19 are clarified. In this research, a hybrid DL method is used to forecast
the rate of new cases and new deaths for 1, 3 and 7 days ahead. The proposed models are
compared with other prediction DL models used previously, and the superiority of Bidirectional methods is to be determined. This model uses this DL model which includes an
input layer, an output layer and three hidden layers. All three layers are Bi-directional. The
number of neurons in the first, second and third hidden layers is 50. In all layers, the Rectified
Linear Unit (ReLU) function is used as the activation function, the Adam function as the
optimiser, and the MSE function as the loss function. The Beta1 and Beta2 values are 0.9 and
0.999. The value of the learning rate is 0.001. The last 100 days in the dataset are used to test,
and the rest of the data is used to train. 20% of the training data is used for validation. Each of
the new cases and new death data is entered into the model to train. The results of the model
are reviewed after 200 epochs. To train the model, each time series enters the model, and the

output of the model is a number to predict the next day. The model is then retrained, and the
model output is 3 numbers to predict the next three days. Finally, the model trains for the third
time and the output of the model is 7 numbers to predict the next seven days. As expected, the
model error rate for forecasting the next 1, 3 and 7 days increase. All three models are tested
over a period of 100 days, and the amount of errors obtained is examined. The mentioned
training process is implemented both for the time series of new cases and for the time series of
new deaths. In this study, the time series of Australia and Iran have been used. Figure 2
illustrates the research map.
3.2. Data Description
The main research objective is predicting COVID-19 prevalence in the future, focusing on the
new cases and the new death rate. Dataset is related to the statistical reports of COVID-19
cases, and the mortality rate of different countries has been obtained from the WHO website
[53]. WHO publishes daily condition reports [53] with new patients on COVID-19 worldwide.

Figure 2: Research map
The dataset includes eight different columns called “Date Reported”, “Country Code”,
“Country”, “WHO Region”, “, and “Cumulative Cases, Cumulative Deaths”. In this research,
“New Cases”, “Cumulative Cases”, “New Deaths”, “Cumulative Deaths” columns are used as
time series to forecast future new case rates and new death rates in Australia and Iran countries.

COVID-19 information of all countries is available on the WHO website, but research authors
are usually interested in using their country data. In the presented study, data from two in a
way different countries Australia and Iran is used. Table 2 defines other features including date,
country code, country, and WHO region.

3.3. Proposed Method
Based on the literature review, it seems that no similar research has been done. So this research
is the first one that uses three different models of deep learning and their Bi-directional models
to forecast new cases and new death rate of COVID-19 for the next seven days. All six models
are tested with similar parameters, and the results obtained from each are presented. These
results are then compared. In this study, the WHO website’s database predicts new cases and
new death rates. There are several new cases in both daily and cumulative time series. There
are also many new deaths in both daily and cumulative time series. In this study, to predict the
rate of each of the mentioned time series, deep learning is used.
The models used in this research include an input layer, an output layer, and three hidden layers.
In the first model, the hidden layers are of the LSTM type. In the second model, the hidden
layers are Conv-LSTM, and finally, in the third model, the hidden layers are of the GRU type.
Models 4, 5 and 6 are precise with the architecture of models 1 to 3, the material of their hidden
layers is two-sided.
It is necessary to mention that in the Conv-LSTM model, the LSTM layers are of the
Convolutional type. This means that this model is not a combination of LSTM and
Convolutional layers, but all three LSTM layers are Convolutional. This paper examines Bidirectional models for all three major models that have not previously been implemented for
the same data. In Table 3, details of parameters for implemented models are shown.

Each time series of new cumulative cases and new cumulative deaths are used to test and train
deep learning models. Approximately 70% of the data is separated to train, and 30% of the data
is separated from testing. About 20% of the training data is used for validation. The test phase
is the forecasting phase. The forecast is provided as one day, three days and seven days for
each model to test the model.
In the presented models, some new cases or new deaths are given to the models as input. Each
model can forecast the new cases and deaths rate for the next day, three days, and seven days.
It is important to note that the Conv-LSTM has a slight difference in input from the other two
models. At the Conv-LSTM input, the model requires the application of a kernel over data,
with a minimum kernel size of 1*2 being selected in this study. Therefore, the Conv-LSTM
model requires at least four numbers for input to apply two 1*2 kernels to the input. According
to the mentioned point, the Conv-LSTM model’s input is a time series with four numbers. That
is the data on the desired day and three days before.

4. Experimental Results and Analysis
The LSTM, Conv-LSTM and GRU are compared with any of the methods of Bi-LSTM, BiConv-LSTM, and Bi-GRU that are used for the first time to forecast. For this reason, it has
been tried to implement all methods with relatively similar conditions. The error evaluation
criterion has been used to compare these methods. The methods used to estimate the prediction
are listed below, along with their abbreviations and formulas. Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error
(MAPE), Mean Squared Log Error (MSLE), Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE), and
Explained Variance (EV) criteria have been used to calculate the error [5]. Here is how to
calculate each of the evaluation criteria [36]:

Where 𝑦𝑖 is the actual values, 𝑦̂𝑖 is the corresponding estimated values, and n is the number

4.1. Experimental Results
After implementing each of the mentioned methods, the amount of error for the next 1, 3 and
7 days was calculated for each of the methods. It is important to note that the errors of the next
1, 3, and 7 days in a 100-day period has been calculated for new cases and new deaths in
Australia and Iran. This 100-day interval corresponds to the last 100 days of data in the
database. About two-thirds of the data is used to train models, and about one-third of the data
is used to test models.
The 100-day period is divided into 1, 3 and 7-day blocks to calculate the error for 1, 3 and 7
days in the 100-day interval. After predicting the models for 1, 3 and 7 days, the predicted
values are compared with the actual values, and the error rate is calculated based on evaluation
criteria. The results of calculating the errors in the 100-day period for each of Australia’s

models are given in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Figure 3 deals with new cases during this period,
and Figure 4 deals with new deaths. The results of calculating the errors in the 100-day period
for each of the models in Iran are given in Figure 5 and Figure 6. Figure 5 is for new cases
during this period, and Figure 6 is for new deaths. The numbers predicted by all models of real
numbers are given in the form of line charts for new cases and new deaths, separately for each
of Australia and Iran countries. Figures 7 to 10 visualise these forecasting.

4.2. Statistical Analysis
Friedman [54] proposed a non-parametric statistical test known nowadays as the Friedman test.
This test is widely used by researchers to analyse their methods [55]. In this subsection, the
statistical method is used to compare the ability of the algorithms. In the aspect of the average
of error evaluation metrics on the data sets which are shown in Table 4. In this test, the best
algorithm obtains rank one, and the other algorithms are ranked. So by using this strategy,
Table 5 is obtained.
Suppose the rank of the j-th classifier on the i-th data set is denoted by
1

𝑗

so the average rank

of the algorithms can be computed by 𝑅𝑗 = 𝛴𝑟𝑖 and finally, the Friedman test is computed
𝑁

by the following formula:

𝑋𝐹2 =

12𝑁
𝑘(𝑘+1)

[∑𝑗 𝑅𝑗2 −

𝑘(𝑘+1)2
4

] (5)

Where k and N are the numbers of algorithms and data sets. Motivated by Friedman test, Iman
and Davenport [56] proposed a comfortable statistic test as follows:
𝐹𝑓 =

(𝑁−1)𝑋𝐹2

(6)

𝑁(𝑘−1)−𝑋𝐹2

Which is distributed according to the F-distribution with ((k − 1),(k − 1)(N − 1)) degrees of
freedom. With the help of Table 5, the values of the χ2F and Ff are respectively computed as
follows:
𝑋𝐹2 =

12 × 12
6(6 + 1)2
[(3)2 + (3.25)2 + (4.83)2 + (4.08)2 + (2.33)2 + (3.42)2 −
]
6(6 + 1)

= 10.84

𝐹𝑓 =

(12 − 1) × 10.84
= 2.43
12(6 − 1) − 10.84

According to six algorithms and 12 data sets, Ff is distributed pursuant to the F-distribution
with ((k − 1), (k − 1)(N − 1)) = (5,55) degree of freedom. The critical value of F(5,55) is 2.38
for α = 0.05. In view of the algorithms’ average rank and the value of the Ff, which is not much
greater in comparison with the critical value, there are no remarkable differences between the
six algorithms. As we see in Table 4 the Bi-GRU algorithm has the best average rank among
all the algorithms and fallowed by LSTM, GRU, Bi-Conv-LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM.
5. Discussion
Time series prediction is an important topic in finance, economics, and business. By the later
progression in computers’ computational power and ML methods and new perspectives such
as DL, new algorithms are created to analyse and predict time series data. Algorithms such as
LSTM, GRU, Conv-LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) and Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-Conv-LSTM) methods. Each
algorithm has its advantage and disadvantage, and as mentioned before, Bi-directional methods
have been used to get an accurate prediction. The comparison of each method with Bidirectional ones is stated as follows.
5.1. Comparison of Methods
In this paper, six methods have been used that it seems that for each of the time series and each
of the models, Bi-directional models have performed better than the other models and have
been able to achieve lesser errors. So that, Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU and Bi-Conv-LSTM were better
than LSTM, GRU and Conv-LSTM. There is some advantage of each model compared to
others that are mentioned here.
5.1.1. LSTM vs Bi-LSTM
The models based on LSTM embed extra “gates” to memorise longer sequences of input data.
Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) enables extra training by navigating the input information
twice (i.e., 1) left-to-right, and 2) right-to-left). In comparing the LSTM and Bi-LSTM models,
the percentage of reductions is low in the LSTM method in predicting data in this article
5.1.2. GRU vs Bi-GRU
The GRU controls the stream of data like the LSTM unit, but without utilising a memory unit.
It just uncovered the full hidden content without any control. GRU is relatively new, and the

performance with LSTM is more efficient, and GRUs are less difficult, and it is easier to change
for example adding new gates in case of additional input to the network. It is just a lesser code
in general. Bidirectional GRU is also the sibling of LSTM which has two gates instead of three
gates in LSTM. The other difference LSTM has both cell states and hidden states, but GRU
has only hidden states. As the results show, Bi-GRU models can better forecast certain data
types, such as predicting new cases and new deaths.
5.1.3. Conv-LSTM vs. Bi-Conv-LSTM
Convolutional LSTM is recurrent neural networks that can use the structure of convolution to
predict time series. Conv-LSTM could be a modiﬁcation of LSTM. To illustrate the
predominance of the proposed Bi-CLSTM demonstrate, this study quantitatively and
subjectively compares it with the previously mentioned methods, and the results are shown in
the graphs.
The displayed graphs illustrate the error rate in the new cases and new death rate in Iran and
Australia, which is determined by mentioned methods. (LSTM, GRU, Conv-LSTM, Bi-LSTM,
Bi-GRU and Bi-Conv-LSTM). On the other hand, some methods are superior, which is
determined by the average reduction in error rates obtained by them. Overall, it can be said that
the bi-directional methods had a better result than the other methods on days 1, 3 and 7, both
in terms of new cases and the number of deaths.
In terms of the number of deaths in Australia and Iran, in 1-day ahead data, the Bi–GRU model
in Australia and the GRU model in Iran had fewer errors. Similarly, in 3-days ahead in
Australia, the GRU model and Bi-Conv-LSTM in Iran had the best result in 3 and 7-days ahead
data. On the other hand, the number of new cases in Australia and Iran, in a day ahead data,
LSTM and Bi-GRU models in Australia and the Bi-GRU model in 1 and 3-days data of Iran,
reached the better result. For the 7-day ahead in both countries, the Bi-Conv-LSTM model was
better than the rest of the models.
6. Conclusions
The strategy was compared with the six mentioned models in a period of 100 days for the next
1, 3 and 7 days. The benchmark here is errors. So the lower error rate indicates the superiority
of Bi-directional models compare to other models such as LSTM, Conv-LSTM and GRU. The
superiority of Bi-directional models to predict the new cases can be seen in the results.

According to the design of these models and their results, it can be concluded that if the cases
and the deaths rate are available, the new cases and the deaths rate in the coming days can be
predicted. The number of infected and killed by all countries is available on the WHO
organisation’s official website. As a result, by having this information for each country and
designing the Bi-directional models, it can be predicted the new cases and the deaths rate in
the next 1, 3 and 7 days, which can be generalised to more extended periods, for example, the
100-day interval in this study.
By averaging the new cases and new deaths rate for both Australia and Iran countries and all
methods, the best methods were identified. With this averaging, it was found that the 1-day
ahead, Bi-GRU method had the best performance with an average of EV=0.999, MAPE=1.624,
MSLE=3e-04, and RMSLE=0.018. For the 3-days ahead, the GRU method had the best
performance with an average of EV=0.996, MAPE=3.266, MSLE=0.001, and RMSLE=0.039.
For the 7-days ahead, the Bi-Conv-LSTM method had the best performance with an average
of EV=0.998, MAPE=5.902, MSLE=0.009, and RMSLE=0.080. Statistical analyses also
showed that the Bi-GRU method had the best performance with an average rank of 2.33.
Despite the Friedman test shows no significant difference between all the methods. By
comparing normal and Bi-directional methods, it is possible to obtain that Bi-directional
models provide a more accurate prediction for this type of data. This study tried to use the same
parameters for all deep learning methods to determine their differences better. Although the
proposed methods’ performance has been evaluated within the WHO dataset to predict the
number of new cases and new deaths of COVID-19, the proposed methods can be used in
various other time series. Because many other sciences face the challenge of accurately
predicting future numbers.
A useful step can be taken to make appropriate decisions during and after COVID-19 by
medical centres and organisations by presenting this research. Other benefits of this study
include indicating the way to health canters to better performance in a crisis and more accurate
government investment by having information on the number of future corona disease and
death rate. In the future, the plan is to anticipate other effective factors at the beginning of
COVID-19 and use a combination of other machine learning and deep learning methods to
achieve these goals.
