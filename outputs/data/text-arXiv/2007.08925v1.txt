Abstract: Approaches to the calculation of the full state vector of a lager epidemiological
model for the spread of COVID-19 in Sweden at the initial time instant from available data
and with a simplified dynamical model are proposed and evaluated. The larger epidemiological
model is based on a continuous Markov chain and captures the demographic composition of
and the transport flows between the counties of Sweden. Its intended use is to predict the
outbreak development in temporal and spatial coordinates as well as across the demographic
groups. It can also support evaluating and comparing of prospective intervention strategies in
terms of e.g. lockdown in certain areas or isolation of specific age groups. The simplified model
is a discrete time-invariant linear system that has cumulative infectious incidence, infected
population, asymptomatic population, exposed population, and infectious pressure as the state
variables. Since the system matrix of the model depends on a number transition rates, structural
properties of the model are investigated for suitable parameter ranges. It is concluded that
the model becomes unobservable for some parameter values. Two contrasting approaches to
the initial state estimation are considered. One is a version of RauchTungStriebel smoother
and another is based on solving a batch nonlinear optimization problem. The benefits and
shortcomings of the considered estimation techniques are analyzed and compared on synthetic
data for several Swedish counties.
Keywords: Mathematical models, initial states, linear systems, smoothing filters, Markov
models, model approximation.
1. INTRODUCTION
This paper is concerned with using publicly available
epidemiological data for estimating suitable initial conditions for a large mechanistic general Susceptible-ExposedInfectious-Recovered (SEIR) model of the Swedish COVID19 outbreak. The model incorporates spatial communication between the Swedish municipalities, and also includes
the Swedish demographics, thought to be an important
factor for the impact of COVID-19 Keeling and Rohani
(2008). The viral contraction is driven by an infectious
pressure as in Widgren et al. (2018); Engblom et al. (2019).
Fig. 1 provides an overview of the modeling approach and
specifies the included compartments.
The dynamics of the disease transmission are modeled by a
discrete-state continuous-time Markov chain. A continuous
state variable, the environmental compartment, is included
to model the infectious pressure. The Markov chain model
is implemented using the computational framework SimInf
in R, Widgren et al. (2019). To infer the model parameters,
the aim is to utilize a Bayesian approach as it allows the
use of empirical measures as prior knowledge of the model
parameters.

Swedish COVID-19 outbreak. Arrows denote the flows

hospitalized (H), intensive care (W), post-intensive
care (P), deceased (D), recovered (R). (b) The full
model is a network of compartment models emulating
the commuting network between the Swedish municipalities. The yellow rectangle shows a zoom-in view
of the network within the greater Stockholm region.
The problem of estimating the state vector of a dynamical
system backwards in time is known as smoothing. An
optimal (minimal variance) fixed-interval smoother for a
linear time-invariant model under additive Gaussian noise
assumption was derived in Rauch et al. (1965). Since then,
various methods have been devised for more general settings, including state-dependent Gaussian noise (Aravkin
and Burke (2012)) and non-Gaussian noise sources (Wang
et al. (2020)). In the present work, these two complications

occur combined, as the process noise is Poisson-distributed
rather than Gaussian, and also dependent on the plant
state. Therefore, none of the approaches found in the
literature is readily applicable here. Instead, to obtain a
plausible solution fast, empirical initialization algorithms
are developed and compared to determine which one is
most suitable in the final setup. To establish ground truth,
synthetic data produced by models of increasing complexity are utilized in the performance evaluation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, the
model initialization problem is formulated and the properties of the linear time-invariant model that is used to
calculate the initial condition are explored. Then, three
model-based approaches to solving the initialization problem are presented. Finally, performance of the considered
approaches is evaluated on synthetic data and conclusions
are drawn.
2. MODEL INITIALIZATION PROBLEM
The inputs to the Markov chain model are the parameters
inferred from data and an initial chain state. The initial
state consists of the epidemiological states in all compartments, including the hidden states, i.e., the exposed and
asymptomatic carriers.

so that historical data for the observed output agree well
with the output produced by the model.
As there were no deaths from the disease and very few
individuals were in intensive care prior to the chosen
point of initialization, the measurements that are used
as input to the Markov chain model cannot be used
for the initialization of it. Instead, reported county-wise
cumulative incidence from the period of February 4th
to March 12th 2020 are utilized. As contact tracing was
discontinued after this period, incidence data from later
times are significantly less reliable.
2.2 Initialization model
Since direct inversion of a continuous Markov chain is
not easily apprehended, the following linear time-invariant
approximation is utilized for the initialization of the model
for each county, whereas the model states are lumped
over the considered age groups. The latter simplification is
introduced since the cases were few in the beginning of the
outbreak and patient age was not specified in the data.

The model is derived as a normal approximation of the
Poisson distributed forward steps and formulated in statespace form as
xk+1 = F xk + wk ,

The parameters are positive and so are the elements of the
state matrix F . Therefore, model (1) is also positive, i.e.
the state vector belongs to the positive quadrant provided
the initial condition x0 and wk , k = 0, 1, . . . do. The latter
condition restricts the distribution of the process noise.
To obtain the parameter values for model (1), prior distributions for the Bayesian parameter estimation algorithm
of the Markov chain model are utilized. The prior distributions are based on empirical data or published estimates.
For parameter values from these distributions, the matrix
F tends to have one eigenvalue with magnitude larger
than one and is therefore unstable. This is expected, since
exponential growth is observed during the early phase of
a disease outbreak.
Since the cumulative incidence is the only measured signal,
the output of the model is
yk = Hxk + vk ,
(2)
where
H = [1 0 0 0 0] ,
and vk is the measurement noise with zero mean and
variance Rk . The introduction of measurement noise is
a matter of complying with the standard assumptions of
Kalman filtering and not an actual model property.
Model (1), (2) does not possess structural observability for

2.3 Process noise covariance
In order to analyze the process noise covariance, each error
vector wk is separated into two terms:
wk = w1k + w0k ,
where w1k describes the error of approximating the
stochasticity of the full Markov chain model by the linear dynamics of (1), and w0k captures any other model
uncertainty, including both differences between the models
(e.g. the spread between counties) and differences between
the complete model and the true outbreak dynamics. The
process noise covariance matrix Qk is split accordingly as
Qk = Q1 k + Q0 .
The model uncertainty is assumed to be additive, independent of k, and uncorrelated between the components.
Therefore, Q0 is diagonal and constant.
The evaluation of the approximation error covariance Q1 k
is more challenging. When the Markov chain model is

Q1 k

sampled, the distributions of the elements of w1k are given
by sums of Poisson processes that are shifted to have zero
mean, and with variance that depend on the populations
in the different compartments.
The matrix Q1 k is thus state-dependent and evaluated to
(3). To avoid confusion with pure time-varying case, the
explicit notation is utilized
Qk = Q(xk ).
3. SMOOTHING PROBLEM
Let ID = [0, d] define a finite interval of discrete time
instants corresponding to the measurements yk , k ∈ ID ,
and m ∈ ID be the point of initialization of the Markov
chain model.
An estimate x̂m|d of xk |k=m defined by model (1) is then
sought from the output data yk , k ∈ ID . The problem at
hand was approached using three different methods, which
are presented next.
3.1 Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother
The Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother (Rauch et al.
(1965)) is a recursive method for solving fixed-interval
smoothing problems. It is proven to be an optimal
smoother, when the noise sources are Gaussian and independent of the system states, and lacks theoretical justification in the present case. Even stability properties of
the RTS smoother are not readily guaranteed. However,
as the results of Section 4 demonstrate, it can nonetheless
be used empirically. The stability concerns are not critical
as the estimation is performed with a discrete LTI model
and on a finite time interval.
The RTS smoother is a two-pass algorithm consisting
of a Kalman filter that is run for the full interval in a
forward pass, followed by a backwards pass, when the state
estimates are smoothed. The Kalman filter equations that
are solved recursively from the initial conditions x̂0 and
P0|0 are

x̂k|k = x̂k|k−1 + Kk ỹk
Pk|k = (I − Kk H)Pk|k−1 ,
where x̂k|k−1 and x̂k|k are the a priori and a posteriori
state estimates, Pk|k−1 and Pk|k are the a priori and a
posteriori estimate covariances, ỹk is the innovation, Sk is
the innovation covariance, and Kk is the Kalman gain.

Notice that the Kalman filter requires knowledge of the
covariance matrix Qk for 1 ≤ k ≤ d. In the present case,
the covariance matrix is not available, since it depends
on the unknown states of the system. Therefore, the plant
state is replaced by its estimate, and the covariance matrix
Qk is approximated as
Q̂k = Q(x̂k|k−1 ).
The a priori and a posteriori state and covariance estimates at each time are are saved for the backwards pass.
Then the algorithm proceeds backwards from the last
time point d. The smoothed estimate x̂k|d is calculated
recursively via the equations
x̂k|d = x̂k|k + Ck (x̂k+1|d − x̂k+1|k ),
Pk|d = Pk|k + Ck (Pk+1|d + Pk+1|k )Ck| ,
−1
where Ck = Pk|k F | Pk+1|k
and Pk|d is the smoothed
estimate covariance.

3.2 Ordinary least squares
The problem of estimating x̂m|d can be approached as
an optimization problem and solved once, rather than
recursively. The simplest setup is based on the linear
relation between the measurement and the state (i.e.
backcasting) and leads to the algebraic system
yd = HF k−d xk + w̃k ,
where the properties of the noise w̃k will be elaborated
upon in Section 3.3. The state estimation problem is then
formulated as
x̂m|d = arg min ||Y − Φxm ||2 ,

Optimization problem (4) can be solved using standard
techniques for linear least squares. Furthermore, positivity
of the state estimation can be enforced by using constrained least squares.

The error terms w̃k are thus neither uncorrelated nor
homoscedastic, so the Gauss-Markov theorem does not
apply to the ordinary least squares formulation in (4).

If the process noise covariance matrices were independent
of the system states, the best linear unbiased estimator
would be obtained by including the covariance in the
formulation as
x̂m|d = arg min(Y − Φxm )| Ω(SQ )−1 (Y − Φxm ).
xm

Since the process noise is state-dependent in our case, the
state estimation problem cannot be approached directly.
The matrix Ω(SQ ) will be instead estimated. For this purpose, introduce the set ŜQ (xm ) of approximated process
noise covariance matrices as
ŜQ (xm ) = {Q(F k−m xm )}dk=0 .
A simplified version of the estimation problem can then
be expressed as
x̂m|d = arg min(Y − Φxm )| Ω(ŜQ (xm ))−1 (Y − Φxm ). (5)

Since Ω(ŜQ (xm )) depends on xm , this problem is nonlinear. In this work, its solution is sought iteratively by
applying Algorithm 1.

For the parametrizations of F that appear in this work, the
observability matrix Φ that is utilized in solving the least
squares problems of state estimation becomes numerically
infeasible to calculate if m is too large. The reason for
this is that F has eigenvalues that are significantly smaller
than one in magnitude, so that repeated inversions result
in very large elements in Φ. To avoid this problem, the
number of elements that was included in the optimization
formulations was limited. For parametrizations, where one
eigenvalue of F is very close to zero, the solution was to
remove the corresponding state through truncation, thus
treating the state as identical zero.

The basic method presented above can be potentially
improved through weighting by taking into account the
correlation of the error terms w̃k . To this end, let SQ =

The three estimation algorithms introduced above were
evaluated using two types of synthetic data. First, linear
model (1) was used to generate the data, with the same
Poisson-distributed state dependent noise sources as derived for the estimators. Then, the data were generated
from stochastic simulations of the Markov chain model.
In both cases, the models were simulated repeatedly over
a time horizon of 42 days (d = 42), from identical initial
conditions (distinct between the two cases) and with identical parameter values (identical between the two cases),
that were randomly selected from the prior parameter
distributions. The probability distributions of the state
estimation errors for m = 30 were estimated by fitting
kernel distribution and compared to each other.

4.2 Synthetic data from the Markov chain model

The estimated estimation error distributions for the states
I, E and A in the three counties are shown in Fig. 3 –
Fig. 5.
Similarly to the case considered in Section 4.1, the RTS
smoother is generally better at estimating the infected
population. It is hard to draw conclusions apart from this
from the plots, as the characteristics of the distributions
vary between the counties.

complete model, this model was simulated using estimated

In this case, 50 realizations were generated and data from
the three counties that were subject to spread of the
disease in the highest number of realizations (33, 33 and 31
respectively) were analyzed. To capture the larger model
discrepancy, the diagonal elements of Q0 were set to 2 and

The estimated distributions for all model states are shown
in Fig. 2. The RTS smoother appears to perform the best,
mostly through lower uncertainty in the infected population estimate. The main difference between the linear
and nonlinear least squares formulations is the significantly
higher uncertainty in the cumulative incidence estimation
for the linear method. This makes sense as the linear
method does not exploit the low uncertainty of the measurement of this state, that is encoded in the covariance
model.

kernel distribution fitting. The results are depicted in
Fig. 6 – Fig. 8.

Three approaches to a fixed interval smoothing problem
with the purpose of initialization of a larger epidemiological model have been compared; one based on the
Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother and two batch optimization methods. The non-Gaussian state-dependent noise in
the model implies that standard approaches could not be
used directly, instead covariance estimates were used in
two of the methods. The results indicate that the smoother
performs better than the other methods, despite the lack
of theoretical justification of the method.

The main conclusion that can be drawn from these results
is that the variations between the considered estimation
algorithms have limited effect on the states of the system
in the end of the simulation, compared to the variations
due the stochastic simulation. A greater variance in the
states can be observed for the initial conditions generated
by the RTS smoother compared to the other, but no

Simulations from estimated initial conditions indicate that
the effect of minor estimation errors is limited compared
to the variations inherit to the stochastic simulation of
the Markov chain model. This suggests that computational
complexity, robustness and ease of implementation might
be of greater importance than high accuracy, when the
initialization algorithm is chosen.
