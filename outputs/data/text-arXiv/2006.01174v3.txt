Abstract
This paper describes BIMCV COVID-19+, a large dataset from the
Valencian Region Medical ImageBank (BIMCV) containing chest X-ray
images CXR (CR, DX) and computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID19+ patients along with their radiological findings and locations, pathologies, radiological reports (in Spanish), DICOM metadata, Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M
(IgM) diagnostic antibody tests. The findings have been mapped onto
standard Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) terminology and
cover a wide spectrum of thoracic entities, unlike the considerably more
reduced number of entities annotated in previous datasets. Images are
stored in high resolution and entities are localized with anatomical labels and stored in a Medical Imaging Data Structure (MIDS) format.
In addition, 10 images were annotated by a team of radiologists to include semantic segmentation of radiological findings. This first iteration of the database includes 1,380 CX, 885 DX and 163 CT studies
from 1,311 COVID-19+ patients. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest COVID-19+ dataset of images available in an open
format. The dataset can be downloaded from http://bimcv.cipf.es/

Background & Summary
SARS-Cov-2 has created an unprecedented pandemic situation. The scientific
community has focused on the development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the better diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19+ patients, but these
efforts are often performed on proprietary datasets, whereas few image studies
of patients positive to COVID-19 are publicly available.
During the first half of March 2020, the American College of Radiology
(ACR) published guidelines concerning medical imaging for COVID-19 diagnosis
[1]. Some of its recommendations include the following: “CT should not be
used to screen for or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19, CT should be
used sparingly and reserved for hospitalized, symptomatic patients with specific
clinical indications for CT”. This recommendation coincides with our initial
commitment to focus on conventional radiology as a tool to aid the diagnosis,
prognosis and triage of COVID-19 patients.
The BIMCV COVID-19+ dataset is a large open multi-institutional databank that provides the open scientific community with data of clinical-scientific
value that will help the early detection and evolution of COVID-19. Given the
current COVID-19 pandemic, both speed and efficiency in developing accurate
medical solutions are key factors that will enable them to reach the clinical environment in the shortest possible time. Making the information accessible to the
scientific community worldwide will undoubtedly maximize the usefulness of the
data. Some well-known examples of the scope and benefit of open access medical data-sets are Pan-cancer Atlas (TCGA) [2] of the National Cancer Institute,
the MIMIC data-set [3, 4] by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, and
Padchest [5] from BIMCV and the University of Alicante.
The proposed dataset is intended to be incremental, and new images along
with their annotations will, therefore, be continuously added when available.
At this time (first iteration), BIMCV COVID-19+ contains 1,380 CR, 885 DX,
and 163 CT full-resolution images from 1,311 patients.
The data provided for each study, detailed in Sec. Data Records, include
the images, anonymized DICOM metadata, anonymized radiologic reports (in
Spanish) and UMLS biomedical vocabulary unique identifiers (CUIs) associated
to each image (for example, ‘infiltrate’, ’pleural effusion’, etc.) organized in
semantic trees. In addition, a team of radiologists has manually annotated 10
images with the Regions of Interest (ROI) of the findings that are related to
COVID-19.
Regarding previous COVID-19 datasets, Table 2 summarizes the main features of the datasets published to date. First, we describe the public datasets.
COVID-CHESTXRAY [6] is a public dataset of pneumonia cases with chest
X-ray or CT images, specifically COVID-19 cases, along with MERS, SARS, and
ARDS. Data are collected from public sources in order not to infringe patient
confidentiality, and it contains data from 205 patients. COVID-CT [7] is a CT
public dataset. Images are collected from COVID-19 related publications, and
are extracted directly from papers in PDF format. The quality of images is not,
therefore, optimal. The number of patients is similar that stated above. SIRM3

COVID [8] is a dataset of COVID-19 cases with RX and CT images. It contains
only positive cases, and includes both radiological and clinical reports. COVID19 RADIOGRAPHY DATABASE [9] is published in Kaggle and contains a
large number of normal Rx (1,341) and other viral pneumonia images (1,345).
However, it contains few COVID-19 positive images.
There are also some private datasets. The authors of [10] describe a nonpublic dataset that contains a large number of CT images, along with 1,735 samples for community acquired pneumonia and 1,325 for non-pneumonia. Another
private CT dataset is described in [11]. In this case, it contains 877 COVID-19+
images and 541 COVID-. Finally, [12] also has a private CT dataset, with 1,659
positives and 1,027 with community acquired pneumonia.
In summary, to the best of our knowledge, BIMCV COVID-19+ is the first
dataset that includes radiological findings. In addition, it is the only COVID-19
bank in which some images are labeled ROIs annotated by radiologists. Moreover, it is the largest dataset as regards number of images and patients, and
includes multiple samples for each patient in order to analyze their clinical evolution. The dataset is intended to be incremental and it will grow as soon
as images are available. This work describes the dataset at its first iteration

(version 1), with release date 28/05/2020.

Methods
This section addresses the methodology used to produce the data. We also describe the ethics involved in the process of data acquisition, the data anonymization, and the labeling process.

Ethics statement
The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Miguel Hernandez University
(MHU) approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective cohort study. The study
was approved by the local institutional ethics committee CElm: 12/2020 at Arnau de Vilanova Hospital in Valencia Region. The healthcare authorities of the
Comunitat Valenciana authorized the publication of the open database based
on the basis of different reports that had to be written, of which the following should be highlighted: a favorable report from the Data Protection Officer
(DPO); a development report of an Impact study; a PIs confidentiality agreement; a confidentiality agreement between researchers; the declaration of a data
protection officer for all participating entities; a compliance report of security
measures proposed in the DPO report and, finally, a detailed risk study together
with mitigation measures for detected risks.

Data acquisition
The data was acquired following the process described in [13]. R & D Cloud
CEIB has four general modules: Search engine (SE), manager of clinical trials
(GEBID), anonymizer (CEIBANON) and BioImage Knowledge Engine (BIKE).
The technology used in R & D Cloud CEIB is based completely on Open Source.
All consecutive studies of patients with at least one positive PCR test or
positive immunological tests (IgM, IgG or IgA) for SARS-Cov-2 in the period of
time between February 26th and April 18th, 2020 were identified by querying the
Laboratory Information System records from the Health Information Systems
in the Comunitat Valenciana. All medical images acquired for such subjects
in this period of time were included in the BIMCV COVID-19+ dataset. The
images included chest x rays (both digital DX and digitalized film CR), along
with computed tomography (CT) scans. The images were retrieved from the
Vendor Neutral Archive (VNA) in the central medical image repository of the
Digital Medical Image Management project (GIMD) appertaining to the public
healthcare system in the Valencian Region (Spain). The data in its first iteration
were obtained from 11 hospitals from the Valencian Region.

Data Geo-positioning
The Valencian healthcare system is arranged in health departments, which are
equivalent to the health areas provided in the General Health Law. The health
5

departments are the fundamental structures of the Valencian healthcare system,
being the geographical demarcations into which the territory of the Valencian
Region is divided for healthcare purposes and constituting the framework for
the integration of healthcare promotion and protection actions, prevention and
cure and rehabilitation of health status, through the coordination of existing
resources and guaranteeing healthcare.
Figure 1 shows the choropleth map containing the number of tests performed
(CR, DX and CT) by the health departments. In this first iteration of the
dataset, it will be noted that most of the departments (11 concretely) are in the
provinces of Alicante and Castellón. For future iterations, we plan to complete
the map.

Data anonymization
The Organic Law 3/2018 [14] establishes the legal framework for data protection
in biomedical research. The reuse of personal data for medical research must
be approved by an ethics committee, and data must be at least pseudonymized
before the researchers attain access. In this respect, anonymization is defined as

6

“the result of the processing of personal data to irreversibly prevent its identification”, which is why anonymization in itself constitutes the additional processing
of personal data. Within this complex and sensitive framework, state-of-the-art
anonymization techniques in Medical Imaging have been applied to the BIMCV
COVID-19+ dataset. The data were anonymized in two ways. First, all references to patient data were removed from the radiological report by using the
methodology explained in [15]. This method is designed to parse Spanish reports. It uses a pre-trained Bidirectional LSTM to identify names and personal
data and remove them from the report.
Second, DICOM anonymization was performed based on DICOM PS3.15
Annex E using a CTP [16] server. Finally, the images were evaluated in a semiautomatic process and some of them were visually inspected to remove or crop
the burnt-in personal information from the chest x-ray images.
Radiological reports anonymization
Anonymization of radiological reports was performed by applying the DisMed
methodology based on a Named Entity Recognition (NER) strategy, which is
focused on the extraction and location of seven predefined entities or categories
(see Table 3) belonging to radiological reports and with a set-up of this system
to be adapted to the domain of medical texts.

Figure 2: Conceptual scheme of radiological report anonymization.

DICOM anonymization
The DICOM standard has already defined the framework that guarantees the
safe access, exchange and processing of medical data. However, to the best of
our knowledge, there are no tools that implement all the confidentiality profiles
defined in Part 15 of the DICOM standard [16, 17] in paragraph E ’Attribute
Confidentiality Profiles’, with the exception of the Clinical Trial Processor (CTP
[18]). To avoid compromising data privacy, it is considered crucial to implement
different modules and scripts within the CTP that will comprise the development
of the ten DICOM confidentiality profiles that are defined in the standard.
The scripts related to the Basic Profile have been applied to each module.
This is the strictest profile and eliminates all the information related to (i) the
identity, along with the identifying and demographic characteristics of the patient; (ii) the identity of the authors, person responsible or relatives; (iii) the
identity of any personnel involved in the procedure; (iv) the identity of the organizations involved in ordering or carrying out the method; (v) the information

(not related to the patient) that could be used to discover the identity of the
original anonymized files (for example, UID, date and time), and (vi) private
attributes (which are not part of the standard).
The system permits different types of anonymity, from the alteration of
the existing text information in DICOM headers up to image-level deformation of parts that can identify the patient (especially in neuroimaging obtained
by magnetic resonance). In the case of RX/DX/CT, no image deformations
were necessary since it is not possible to reconstruct patients’ data from this
information.

Image preprocessing
Raw pixel data were extracted from the DICOM images and stored in files in
nii.gz format. The images were processed by rescaling the dynamic range using
the DICOM window width and center, when available, and stored as 16-bit
PNG images. The images were not re-scaled, to avoid loss of resolution.
The information on image projection was estimated using a neural network
with an EfficientNet [19] architecture. The projection estimation network was
trained with 2, 000 images from Padchest [5], for which the orientation was
estimated manually. The projection was oversimplified to frontal (including
antero-posterior and postero-anterior) and lateral (L). No differentiation was
made between erect, either standing or sitting or decubitus. No differentiation
was made between left lateral or right lateral. Such information could subsequently be inferred by a careful analysis of the DICOM tags.

Labeling
The early detection and location of lesions such as infiltrates, and particularly
ground glass opacities, is essential as regards diagnosis, predicting the evolution
of the patient and helping make clinical decisions. The findings that suggest a
COVID-19 infection are both the ground-glass opacity and consolidation that,
even in the initial stages, affect both lungs, particularly the lower lobes, and
especially the posterior segments, mainly with a peripheral and subpleural distribution [20, 21, 22, 23].
These findings were present on chest CT scans in 44% of patients in the
first two days [20], in 75% of patients in the first four days [21] and in 86% of
patients during illness days 0-5 [22].
These lesions can progress in the following days until they become more diffuse. If associated with septal thickening, they will have a reticular pattern. In
general, they progress both in extension and towards consolidation, concomitantly with the ground glass pattern, and may then have a rounded morphology.
It is very rare for them to be associated with lymphadenopathy, cavitation or
pneumothorax, as occurred with the respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERSCoV [24].
Beyond labeling an image as COVID/No/Others as occurs with most existing datasets, it is, therefore, very important to annotate the radiological findings, for both the diagnosis and the prognosis. It should be considered that these
characteristic lesions frequently appear in non-COVID patients and that, on the
contrary, many COVID-19 patients do not have these lesions. The appearance
of the lesions is related to the level of the disease. It is characteristic that many
of the patients worsen and that lesions appear or become more evident.
To the best of our knowledge, BIMCV COVID-19+ is the first COVID-19
dataset that includes these findings. In addition, in this first iteration, ten
images were also annotated with the ROIs of the findings.
Assigning CUI labels to images
Clinical reports were used as a basis to obtain the radiological findings, differential diagnoses and localization labels. Therefore, images were not used in this
process.
The labels were obtained using the same procedure employed to build PadChest [5], but by adding to the set of labels the COVID-19 (CUI C5203670)
and COVID-19 uncertain (CUI C5203671) to the set of labels, leading to a total
of 336 different labels. After a preprocessing stage in which the words from
the radiological report were stemmed and tokenized, labels were automatically
extracted using a deep neural network multi-label classifier trained with the
PadChest dataset. The network topology is detailed in [5], but was re-trained
with the additional COVID-19 labels.
More specifically, this classifier consists of a bidirectional LSTM with an attention mechanism that receives a preprocessed radiological report encoded as
a sequence of pre-trained word-embeddings, and outputs the most likely labels.

9

Labels corresponding to diagnoses, radiological findings and anatomical localizations are mapped onto the UMLS controlled biomedical vocabulary unique
identifiers (CUIs) and organized into semantic concept trees.
For example, consider the following report sentence: Cambio pulmonar crónico
severo. Signos de fibrosis bibasal. Sutil infiltrado pseudonodular milimétrico en
vidrio deslustrado localizado en bases. Cifosis severa.
In this case, the neural network would outputs the following labels: [’pulmonary fibrosis’, ’chronic changes’, ’kyphosis’, ’pseudonodule’, ’ground glass
pattern’], along with their localizations when available: [[’pulmonary fibrosis’,
’loc basal bilateral’], [’chronic changes’], [’kyphosis’], [’pseudonodule’, ’ground
glass pattern’, ’loc basal’]].
An example of a PadChest semantic concept sub-tree of some lesions that
are frequently associated with COVID-19 is shown below:
infiltrates [CUI:C0277877]
interstitial pattern [CUI:C2073538]
ground glass pattern [CUI:C3544344]
reticular interstitial pattern []
reticulonodular interstitial pattern [CUI:C2073672]
miliary opacities [CUI:C2073583]
alveolar pattern [CUI:C1332240]
consolidation [CUI:C0521530]
air bronchogram [CUI:C3669021]
air bronchogram [CUI:C3669021]

As will be noted, although the radiological reports are provided in Spanish,
labels are mapped onto biomedical vocabulary unique identifier (CUIs) codes,
thus making the dataset usable regardless of the language.
In addition to the PadChest labels that can be found in [5], the new “COVID19” and “COVID-19 uncertain” labels were added as new terms, to denote high
or low suspicion of COVID-19 respectively. To this end, the word-embeddings of
these new labels were pre-computed in the corpus of new reports for COVID-19
patients added to the Padchest Spanish report corpus. The Padchest multilabel text classifier was then trained with the manually labeled reports from
Padchest, but adding 724 new manually annotated sentences (428 from the
BIMCV COVID-19 positive partition and 296 from the BIMCV COVID-19
negative partition) referring to COVID-19 as highly likely, uncertain or negative,
according to the radiologist’s judgment, totaling 23,439 manually annotated
sentences.
Annotation of regions of interest
Since some lesions such as infiltrates, ground glass opacities or consolidation
patterns are the most frequent in COVID-19 patients, a sub-set of 10 images
were annotated with their ROIs by a team of eight radiologists from the Hospital
Universitario de San Juan de Alicante, for the first iteration of the BIMCV
COVID-19+ dataset.
10

Figure 3: Example annotation at pixel level. In blue, consolidation, red marks
ground glass.
As it can be seen in Figure 3, ROIs corresponding to these findings were
labeled at a pixel level using XNAT OHIF Viewer [25]. OHIF is a zero-footprint
medical image viewer provided by the Open Health Imaging Foundation that
stores an XML output with the ROI paths. This information of great value to
train semantic segmentation networks, such as UNet [26], in order to extract
characteristics such as the extension and exact location of the lesions. Table 4
shows the findings annotated at a ROI level.

Data Records
The BIMCV specializes in collecting and organizing data imaging information in
order to facilitate the research on artificial intelligence and big data with medical imaging. The BIMCV team has designed MIDS (Medical Imaging Data
Structure)1 , a standard with which to organize every type of medical information and images in simple hierarchy folders. MIDS constitutes an extension of
the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) standard, a structure that collects
medical resonance brain images (MRI) and which is described in [27]. The objective of MIDS is to expand BIDS, extending its usage to any type of medical
imaging modality and anatomical area of the body, rather than just medical
brain images.
The main goal of MIDS is to define a standard for the organization and
description of medical imaging datasets in the field of artificial intelligence and
to facilitate data sharing. For this, we have adapted the DICOM standard in an
hierarchical organization that will be based on folder organization with simple
file formats (TSV and JSON). The main data types for Imaging are: nifti (3D)
or png (2D) files; for phenotypic data, Tab Separated Value files (.tsv); and for
metadata information (Key/value dictionaries), JSON files.
Figure 4 shows an example of BIMCV COVID-19+ data structured in MIDS
format. The data provided for each sample is described below:
Diagnostic tests: All the diagnostic tests performed on each individual
to diagnose COVID-19. The diagnostic test could be PCR, IGG or IGM. The
result of the test can be positive, negative or indeterminate. A subject can have
several tests during the period of time with different outcomes. The list of tests
is stored in the file sil_reg_covid.csv.

schema (B) General Template (C) Example of folder structure.
Radiological reports: The radiological reports for each image study performed on the subject anonymized, as explained in radiological reports anonymization section. They are included in the file
derivatives/EHR/labels/labels_COVID-19_posi.tsv.
CUI disease and location terms: extracted automatically using the
methodology described in Labeling subsection. They are stored in the same file
as the radiological reports.
CUI hierarchy: a tree description of the CUI hierarchy used to describe
the diseases. File:
/derivatives/EHR/labels/tree_term_CUI_counts_image_covid_posi.csv.
Image data: Each subject can have a plurality of image studies, also
called sessions, performed during the period of time of the observation. Each
image study has a plurality of image series. They are all stored in the directory
structure depicted in Fig. 4. Image data is extracted from the DICOM images
and stored in .nii.gz. The relevant DICOM fields for each image series are stored
in a JSON file with the same name as the image series.

Technical Validation
The data collected contains 1,311 subjects, 2,429 image studies and 5,530 image
series. 602 patients were female (45.92%). The mean age was of 63.11 (± 16.75).
The histogram of the patients’ age is shown in Fig. 5 (top) and is highly coherent
with the demographics of COVID-19+ in Spain.
There is an average of 1.9 image studies per subject. The distribution can be
seen in Fig. 5 (middle). With respect to image modality, the dataset contains

Figure 5: Top: histogram of the patients age. Middle: histogram of the number
of studies per subject. Bottom: histogram of the difference (in days) between
the image study and the diagnostic test. Please note that for most of the studies,
there were less than five days between the radiography and the diagnostic test.
1,380 CX, 885 DX and 163 CT studies. 2,427 chest x-rays were acquired in

14

monochrome 2 photometric interpretation and 751 in monochrome 1. Images
in monochrome 1 should be inverted to be visualized correctly. The vendors of
the devices used to acquire the studies are shown in Table 5. As can be seen,
there are different acquisition systems, which ensures variability in the dataset
images.

1,773 were positive to SARS-Cov-2, 622 negative to SARS-Cov-2 and 30 indeterminate; 29 IGM, 29 IGG and 35 ACT tests were performed, of which 44 were
positive, 32 negative and 17 indeterminate. The average closest time between
an image and a diagnostic test is 5.03 days, the distribution being that shown in
Fig. 5 (bottom). Please note that some images have a diagnostic test as many
as 50 days afterwards. This is acceptable, since the period of observation is two
months and most image studies were performed on the subjects prior to their
COVID-19 diagnosis.
135 studies were deemed suboptimal in the radiology reports. The most
common radiological findings for the images, along with their number of appearances, are shown in Table 6. Owing to the construction of the database,
COVID-19 appears as the most common radiological finding, followed by densities, pneumonia, consolidations and infiltrates, all closely related to COVID-19.
Image anonymization was validated by visually inspecting all the cropped
15

images to verify that none of the patients’ data were displayed.
Chest x-ray images were manually inspected to validate whether the patient
orientation was correctly estimated with the neural network described in the
Image Preprocessing section. The orientation was changed if it was mistakenly
estimated.

Table 6: Radiological findings and diagnoses extracted from the radiology
reports when having more than 50 appearances.
Regarding the labeling of the reports, in some of those in which the text
“COVID-19” was mentioned, those mentions were actually negated expressions
for COVID-19 disease based on the image. The neural network was trained
to ensure that the model could detect these negative COVID-19 cases and validate that the labels “COVID-19” and “COVID-19 uncertain” were correctly
extracted. The model achieved an F 1-micro of 0.922 for the validation set,
with 2,343 manually labeled sentences (including sentences from Padchest [5],
BIMCV COVID-19 positive and BIMCV COVID-19 negative partitions), and
was further validated using an independent test sample.
This independent test sample consisted of 64 new sentences manually labeled
and randomly extracted from the BIMCV COVID-19 negative partition in which
the tern COVID-19 was mentioned. In some cases, it was mentioned negatively
(24), in others it was denoted as low suspicion based on images with atypical
findings “COVID 19 uncertain” (13), and in the rest (27) it was mentioned
affirmatively because the image was compatible with COVID-19 even if those

In addition, the method was evaluated for all included entities, both those
related or not related to COVID-19 pneumonia, in the same independent test
set, using the metrics described in [5], obtaining an F 1-weighted=0.9320, F 1micro=0.9378, and accuracy=0.8281.

Usage Notes
This dataset provides valuable information to professionals and could, for example, be used to train radiologists in this new pathology and understand the
lesions that can be typically found. It additionally serves to train deep learning methods with the images and labels in order to assist radiologists in the
decision-making process.
