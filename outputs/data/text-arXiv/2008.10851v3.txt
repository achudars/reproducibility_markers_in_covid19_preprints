Abstract
Ozone (O3) is a key oxidant and pollutant in the lower atmosphere. Significant increases in surface
O3 have been reported in many cities during the COVID-19 lockdown. Here we conduct
comprehensive observation and modeling analyses of surface O3 across China for periods before
and during the lockdown. We find that daytime O3 decreased in the subtropical south, in contrast to
increases in most other regions. Meteorological changes and emission reductions both contributed
to the O3 changes, with a larger impact from the former especially in central China. The drop in

1

nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission contributed to O3 increases in populated regions, whereas the
reduction in volatile organic compounds (VOC) contributed to O3 decreases across the country. Due
to a decreasing level of NOx saturation from north to south, the emission reduction in NOx (46%)
and VOC (32%) contributed to net O3 increases in north China; the opposite effects of NOx decrease
(49%) and VOC decrease (24%) balanced out in central China, whereas the comparable decreases
(45-55%) in the two precursors contributed to net O3 declines in south China. Our study highlights
the complex dependence of O3 on its precursors and the importance of meteorology in the shortterm O3 variability.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely threatened public health
worldwide, leading to millions of deaths1. China, where the first case of COVID-19 was reported in
the city of Wuhan, imposed country-wide measures from 23 January to 13 February 2020 to prevent
the spread of the disease, including social distancing, teleworking, and closure of non-essential
businesses2, 3. These restrictions drastically reduced anthropogenic activities, resulting in a sharp
decrease in emissions of air pollutants4-6.
The huge and large-scale emission reductions during the COVID-19 lockdown can be treated
as a natural outdoor experiment to improve our understanding of the air pollutant’s response to
emission control. According to satellite and surface observations, compared with the period before
the lockdown, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations decreased by over 50% in China during the
lockdown period7-10. The concentrations of other pollutants, including SO2, particulate matter with
an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter

2

less than 10 µm (PM10), and carbon monoxide (CO), also declined in a large area of China11, 12.
However, surface ozone (O3) concentrations in northern and central China increased by over 100%7,
13

. Similar O3 increases have been reported in southern Europe, India, and Brazil despite the large

decrease in other pollutants14-16. However, the underlying factors driving the O3 changes during the
city lockdowns remain unclear.
This study analyzes surface O3 data across China before and during the COVID-19 lockdown.
We find that O3 decreased in southern China while increasing in most other regions during the
lockdown. Using a regional chemistry transport model, we isolate the impacts of meteorological
changes and anthropogenic emission reductions on O3. Our results highlight the importance of
meteorological influences on the short-term O3 changes and the diverse response of O3 to the
emission reductions of its precursors in different climate and emission-mix regions.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Surface measurement data. We obtained the observed concentrations of surface O3 and other
pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2) at 1643 stations from the China National Environmental
Monitoring Center (http://106.37.208.233:20035/). Data quality control was conducted for the
measurement data in accordance with previous studies17, 18. Fig. S1 shows the locations of these
environmental monitoring sites.
The country-wide measures to control the spread of COVID-19 were implemented starting
from 23 January 2020 (the exact date varies for different cities), just before the Chinese New Year.
All enterprises remained closed until no earlier than 13 February, except those required for essential
public services, epidemic prevention and control, and residential life needs. We focused on the

3

period during the COVID-19 lockdown from 23 January to 12 February 2020 (hereafter referred to
as the CLD period), 3 weeks in total. We derived the changes in O3 and other pollutants by
comparing the CLD period with the 3 weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak, from 2 to 22 January
2020 (hereafter referred to as the pre-CLD period). We focused on three typical regions in China
(Fig. S1): north China (NC, 35-41.5°N, 113-119°E, including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and western
Shandong), central China (CC, 28.8-33°N, 108-117°E, including Hubei province, where Wuhan is
situated, and the surrounding regions), and south China (SC, 21.5-24°N, 111-116°E, including the
Pearl River Delta and the surrounding regions). The NC region is situated in the North China Plain,
which is known to suffer from severe haze in winter; CC was the original epicenter of the COVID19 outbreak in China and is an important economic hub for the central regions of China; the Pearl
River Delta, where the megacities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen are situated, is the most developed
region in southern China. Although our discussions focused on these regions, the results for other
pollution hotspots, such as the Yangtze River Delta (including Shanghai) and the Sichuan Basin
were also shown in various figures in the main text and Supplementary Information.

2.2. Numerical modeling. The CMAQ model (Community Multiscale Air Quality model, v5.2.1)
was applied to simulate the O3 mixing ratios over China from 2 January to 12 February 2020. The
WRF model (Weather Research and Forecasting model, v3.5.1) was driven by the dataset of the
National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) FNL Operational Model Global
Tropospheric Analyses with a horizontal resolution of 1° × 1° and provided meteorological inputs
for the CMAQ model. The CMAQ target domain covered the continental China at a horizontal
resolution of 36 km × 36 km. SAPRC07TIC19, 20 and AERO6i21, 22 were adopted as the gas-phase

4

chemical mechanism and aerosol mechanism, respectively. The CMAQ model has been improved
with updated heterogeneous reactions to better predict the O3 concentration; details can be found in
Liu and Wang

23

. The chemical boundary conditions were provided by the results of Whole

Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM, https://www.acom.ucar.edu/waccm/download).
The anthropogenic emissions in China were obtained from the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory
for China (MEIC) in 2017 (http://www.meicmodel.org) with scaling factors to the year 2020 (Table
S1), which were estimated based on the Three-Year Action Plan (2018–2020) issued by the
government and the changes in the multi-pollutant emissions of different sectors in recent years24.
Emissions from the other countries were derived from the MIX emission inventory25. International
shipping emissions were taken from the Hemispheric Transport Atmospheric Pollution (HTAP)
emission version 2.2 dataset for 201026. Biogenic emissions were calculated by the Model of
Emissions of Gas and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) version 2.127 with meteorological inputs
from the WRF model.
Two experiments were conducted to investigate the impacts of meteorological changes and
emission reductions on O3 during the CLD period. The first (baseline) used the same anthropogenic
emissions for the pre-CLD and CLD periods, and the second (Reduction case) used emission
reductions of 70%, 40% and 30% for transportation, industry and power generation, respectively,
and a 10% increase of residential emission during the CLD period. These emission reductions for
the whole country were estimated according to the previous literature4-6. Comparing these two
model simulations, the O3 changes during the CLD period relative to the pre-CLD period for the
Reduction Case were considered to be entirely due to the meteorological changes and emission
reductions. The impacts of the meteorological changes (including the changes in chemical boundary

5

conditions) were quantified by subtracting the O3 mixing ratios of the CLD period from those of the
pre-CLD period for the baseline experiment, while the impacts of emission reduction were estimated
by comparing the O3 mixing ratio during the CLD period between the Reduction Case and the
baseline experiment. Furthermore, we individually reduced the emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx),
VOCs, CO, PM (particulate matter, including PM10, PM2.5, black carbon, and organic carbon), and
SO2 during the CLD period to elucidate the response of O3 to each pollutant reduction.
The performance of the CMAQ model in simulating the O3, NO2, PM2.5, SO2, and CO
concentrations for the Reduction Case was evaluated (Fig. S2 and Table S2), showing reasonable
agreements with the respective surface observations. Details of the emission estimation and the
model evaluation are presented in Supplementary Information.

3. Results
3.1. Observed O3 changes in different parts of China. Figures 1 and S3 present the changes in
observed concentrations of O3 and other pollutants during the CLD period compared with pre-CLD.
The concentrations of most pollutants (SO2, CO, PM2.5, PM10) that partially or fully originated from
the direct emissions declined in China during the lockdown. NO2, a precursor of O3, decreased by
about 50% across the entire continental China, and by similar amounts in all regions (Fig. S3b).
However, the O3 mixing ratio exhibited varying changes in different regions (Fig. 1a). In NC and
CC, the daily average O3 increased significantly, by 112% and 73%, respectively (Fig. 1b); in
contrast, it remained almost unchanged in SC. The O3 changes also varied between daytime (8:0020:00 LST) and nighttime (20:00-8:00 LST). During daytime, the O3 increase in most parts of China
was smaller than the daily average (Fig. 1c), 92% and 71% in the NC and CC regions (Fig. 1d). In

6

the SC region, most stations displayed a decrease in O3 during daytime, leading to a regional average
O3 drop of 14%. During nighttime, the O3 mixing ratio increased significantly across China (Fig.
1e), by 154%, 77%, and 18% in NC, CC, and SC, respectively (Fig. 1f). These results reveal the
diverse response of O3 during the lockdown in different regions, especially for the daytime. The
changes in the Ox (NO2+O3) concentration (Fig. S3a), which takes into account the NO titration,
also varied in different regions. The daytime average Ox levels increased by 4% in NC and by 11%
in CC, and decreased by 29% in SC. These results suggest that the NO titration effect was not the
only cause of the O3 increase in northern and central China.

3.2. Contribution of meteorological changes and emission reductions to O3. Ground-level O3 is
produced by chemical reactions of O3 precursors, namely, NOx, volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
and CO, under sunlight. Meteorology can modulate O3 concentrations by affecting the chemical
reaction rates, dilution, deposition, transport, and natural emissions of precursors. In this study, we
used the WRF-CMAQ model to separate the impacts of meteorological changes and emission
reductions on the changes in O3 across China (Fig. S4). Fig. 2 shows the results for the NC, CC, and
SC regions. The observed O3 changes in these regions were reasonably captured by the simulations.
Overall, the results showed that the meteorological changes and emission reductions both played an
important role in the O3 changes in these regions. For the daytime average, the O3 increase in NC
was attributed to the comparable contributions from both meteorological changes (58%) and
emission reductions (42%) (Fig. 2a). In CC (Fig. 2b), the meteorological change (98%) was the
primary cause of the O3 increase, whereas the contribution of emission reduction was much lower
(2%). In SC (Fig. 2c), the meteorological changes (73%) and emission reductions (27%) both

7

contributed to the O3 decrease. During nighttime, the emission reduction contributed positively to
O3 changes in all three regions (including SC), and its impact was stronger; the effect of
meteorological changes weakened at night. The trends for the daily average were the average for
the daytime and nighttime conditions.

3.3. Impacts of meteorological changes on O3. The impacts of meteorological changes on O3 for
the NC, CC, and SC regions can be explained by the changes in the weather pattern and specific
meteorological factors. In winter, continental China is generally controlled by a cold high-pressure
system (Fig. S5). During our study period, the center of this high-pressure system was located in
northern China, moving southward from the pre-CLD to the CLD period, with weakening strength.
The high-pressure system therefore became increasingly dominant in southern China, and the
strengthened southward winds brought colder air masses from the north (Fig. S6c), which decreased
the temperature locally (Fig. S6a). In contrast, in central and northern China, the winds shifted to a
more northward direction, transporting warmer air masses from the south (Fig. S6c), which
increased the temperature (Fig. S6a). During daytime, the decrease (increase) in temperature in the
SC region (CC and NC regions) weakened (enhanced) the surface O3 chemical production28, 29,
contributing to the decrease (increase) in O3. Biogenic emission is an important source of VOCs
and thereby contributes to O3 formation in China30. The temperature changes led to an increase
(decrease) of biogenic emissions in the CC (SC) region (Fig. S7). Thus, the temperature changes
increased (decreased) O3 in the CC (SC) region by influencing chemical reaction rates directly and
altering biogenic emissions indirectly.
The changes in the weather pattern also resulted in less clouds and precipitation in northern

8

and central China, but more clouds and precipitation in southern China (Fig. S6e and f). Clouds can
reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface and thus the chemical production of O331,
while precipitation can also reduce O3 through the scavenging of its precursors32, 33. The cloud and
precipitation patterns therefore contributed to O3 increases in CC and NC and decreases in SC.
Furthermore, in NC and CC, the significant increase in the planetary boundary layer height during
the lockdown might promote the transport of O3 from the upper air to the surface, contributing to
the O3 increase in these regions34, 35. The increase (decrease) in specific humidity in NC and CC
(SC) might also have contributed negatively (positively) to the O3 mixing ratios in those regions36,
37

(Fig. S6b). During nighttime, the changes in meteorological factors were similar to those in

daytime (Fig. S8) but exerted smaller impacts on O3 changes due to the decreasing effects of
temperature and cloud cover (negligible biogenic emissions and solar radiation).

3.4. Response of O3 to emission reductions. We further investigated the impact of multi-pollutant
reductions on the O3 changes. Because transportation and industrial activities were reduced
significantly during the lockdown and they are the major sources of NOx (>80%) and VOCs (>60%)
(Fig. S9), the reductions of NOx and VOC emissions were more significant than those for CO,
particulate matter (PM), and SO2 (Fig. 3a, c, e). The estimated NOx emission reductions were 46%,
49%, and 55% in the NC, CC, and SC regions, respectively, while the respective reductions for
VOC emissions were 32%, 24%, and 45%. The relationship between O3 and the emissions of its
precursors is non-linear. We used the ratio of production rates between H2O2 and HNO3
(PH2O2/PHNO3)38, 39 to identify the O3 formation regime in China for the periods before and during the
lockdown (Fig. S10). For the pre-CLD period, during daytime, the VOC-limited (or NOx-saturated)

9

regions (PH2O2/PHNO3<0.06) included North China Plain and other urban areas, while NOx-limited
regions (PH2O2/PHNO3≥0.2) located in southern China and other rural areas (Fig. S10a). During
nighttime, the O3 formation was controlled by VOC in most regions (Fig. S10c). The O3 formation
regime determines the response of O3 to the NOx reduction during the CLD period. During daytime,
NOx reduction increased O3 in NOx-saturated regions, but decreased it in NOx-limited regions (Fig.
S11b). We also found that although the daytime O3 formation regime in most regions shifted from
the VOC-limted regime to the NOx-limited regime after the emission reductions during the CLD
period, the daytime O3 formation in the North China Plain was still controlled by the VOC level
(Fig. S10b), which suggests that the NOx level is still high in this region and further reduction of
NOx is required. During nighttime, the reduction of NOx emission contributed positively to O3 due
to the NO titration effect in a large area (Fig. S11c). The reduction of VOC emission decreased O3
across China (Fig. S11d-f). As an O3 precursor, the reduction of CO emission also contributed to a
small decrease in the O3 mixing ratio (Fig. S11g-i); in contrast, the PM and SO2 emissions reductions
contributed positively to O3 changes (Fig. S11j-o) through the weakening of aerosol effects40, 41, but
their impacts were much smaller and were negligible (< 1 ppbv) due to the smaller reductions,
compared with NOx and VOCs.
The response of O3 to the emission reductions depended on the levels of NOx and VOC
reductions in different regions. For the daytime average, in the NOx-saturated NC region, the
positive contribution of the NOx reduction counteracted the negative contribution of the VOC
reduction, leading to the decrease in negative O3 production rates (Fig. S12) and a substantial net
O3 increase (Fig. 3b). In CC, the contributions of the NOx and VOC reductions were comparable in
magnitude, and their opposing impacts resulted in only a slight change in O3 (Fig. 3d). In the NOx-

10

limited SC region, the impact of the NOx reduction on O3 was smaller than that of the reduction of
VOCs, leading to the decrease in positive O3 production rates (Fig. S12), and a net decrease in O3
(Fig. 3f). During nighttime, the effect of the VOC reduction was weakened due to the lower rate of
degradation of VOCs by radicals compared with daytime, and the O3 level increased in all three
regions due to decreases in the NO titration effect (Fig. S12). The impacts of emission reductions
on whole-day average O3 were similar to those during daytime.
The above results show that the contribution of NOx reductions (with NOx falling by 46%–
55%) to the rise of O3 decreased from NC to CC and to SC, reflecting the decreasing level of NOx
saturation from north to south. In contrast, the impact of the VOC reduction on O3 increased from
north to south, which can in part be attributed to the regional variation of VOC reductions. In the
SC region, transportation and industry are the predominant sources of VOCs (97%, compared with
85% and 60% in NC and CC, respectively) (Fig. S9). During the CLD period, the reduction of VOC
emission in SC (45%) was significant and comparable with the NOx reduction (55%). In contrast,
the VOC reductions in the NC (32%) and CC (24%) regions were much lower (Fig. 3a, c) and could
not offset the positive impact of NOx reduction on O3. The residential sector (mainly household coal
burning) is an important source of VOC emission in the NC and CC regions, whereas its contribution
is smaller in SC. The residential emissions increased during the CLD period because many migrant
workers came back for the Chinese New Year holiday and were stranded there due to the lockdown4,
11

.

4. Discussion and implication
The drastic emission reductions during the COVID-19 outbreak offered an unprecedented real-

11

world scenario to examine the human impacts on the air quality and obtain knowledge to help design
more effective air pollution control policies. The responses of air quality to short-term emission
controls have been studied during a number of public and political events in China, such as the
Beijing Summer Olympic Games (August 2008)42, 43, the Nanjing Youth Olympic Games (August
2014)44, 45, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Beijing (November 2014)46,
47

, the Grand Military Parade in Beijing (September 2015)46, 48, and the G20 summit in Hangzhou

(September 2016)49, 50. During these events, various emission-reducing measures were implemented
in the cities concerned and their surrounding areas. Whereas atmospheric concentrations of primary
air pollutants (NOx, CO, primary PM, and SO2) in the concerned cities generally decreased in
response to the temporary control measures, the O3 concentrations showed mixed responses. O3
decreased after emission reductions for the Grand Military Parade48 and the Nanjing Youth Olympic
Games51 but increased during the Beijing Olympic Games43, G20 summit49, and APEC meeting47.
The different O3 responses can be qualitatively attributed to differences in the meteorological
conditions (including regional transport of air masses) and to different control measures
implemented by the local governments.
Compared with the previously studied situations, the COVID-19 lockdown is unique in that
emissions decreased across the whole country (and later worldwide) as opposed to a specific city or
region, and the decreases were also much more drastic than those due to transportation restrictions
alone. Moreover, the COVID-19 lockdown took place in winter, whereas the previous interventions
occurred in summer and autumn, when meteorology and atmospheric chemistry are different from
winter. We found differences in the responses of surface O3 to the emission decreases during the
COVID-19 lockdown in northern (large increase) and southern (moderate decrease) China.

12

Meteorology played a key role in the O3 changes during the lockdown, highlighting the necessity
of taking meteorology into account when assessing the short-term response of O3 (and other air
pollutants) to emission reductions23.
The COVID-19 lockdown led to larger reductions in NOx and VOCs than in SO2 and PM (Fig.
3). As NOx and VOCs are precursors of O3, the changes in O3 are more sensitive to their reduction
than to the reduction in PM (and SO2), which could increase in the photolysis rates and reduce
uptake of reactive gases. Previous studies showed that the increase in summer O3 concentration
from 2013 to 2017 in China was due to a larger reduction of PM and SO2 than of NOx52. The findings
of such studies on the response of O3 to different real-world emission reduction scenarios
demonstrate the complex relationship of O3 with not only its precursors (NOx and VOC) but also
the particulate matter, highlighting the need for a holistic strategy to control both primary pollutants
and secondary pollutants like O3.
In conclusion, the first country-wide lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak in China
drastically reduced transportation and industrial activities, leading to sharp declines in air pollutant
emissions from these sectors. However, atmospheric O3 responded differently in the northern and
southern regions, which can be explained by changes in meteorology and differences in the O3
chemistry regimes and the magnitudes of precursor reductions in these regions. Our study shows
that the extent of VOC reduction during lockdown, which suppressed O3 formation, was insufficient
to offset the NO titration effect during daytime in northern China, and that larger reductions of
VOCs (e.g., from residential sectors) would have been needed to reduce the O3 concentration in the
northern and central China. The rising O3 concentration in northern China during the COVID-19
lockdown and in recent winters should receive greater attention because O3 boosts the atmospheric

13

oxidative capacity and therefore production of secondary aerosols5,

53, 54

, which are important

components of winter haze in northern China. Our findings in China are relevant to untangling the
underlying factors driving the O3 changes in other parts of the world during their COVID-19
lockdowns.

Estimation of anthropogenic emissions in 2020
We estimated the anthropogenic emission for China in 2020 based on the MEIC 2017
(http://www.meicmodel.org) according to the control plan established by the Chinese government
and the emission trends in recents years. From 2013 to 2017, the Chinese government launched the
to Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan to mitigate haze events. Zheng et al. (2018)
compiled the trends of anthropogenic emissions during this period and demonstrated that the SO2,
NOx, and PM (particulate matter, including PM10, PM2.5, and its components) emissions have been
reduced significantly. In 2018, the Chinese government issued a Three-Year Action Plan (2018–
2020) to further reduce the SO2, NOx, and PM emissions (http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/201807/03/content_5303158.htm). Previous control measures were implemented and the emissions were
thought to continue decreasing after 2017. As the most recent available data on China’s
anthropogenic emissions are from 2017, we estimated the emissions for 2020 based on the MEIC
2017 according to the trends of these emissions in recent years (Zheng et al., 2018). Table S1 shows
the scaling factors from 2017 to 2020 for NO2, PM, and SO2 in the power plant, industry,
transportation, and residential sectors. The VOC emission was assumed to be unchanged from 2017
to 2020 because it increased by only 2% from 2013 to 2017 (Zheng et al., 2018). The NO2, PM, and
SO2 emissions from transportation were also assumed constant from 2017 to 2020, considering that
they had changed little during 2015–2017. The NOx emission in the residential and industrial sectors
was assumed to be the same in 2020 as in 2017 in view of its flat trend in recent years. Because the
NOx emission from power plants decreased by ~47% from 2013 to 2017 (11.7% per year), we
assumed it to further decrease by 35% from 2017 to 2020. The same approaches were applied to the
reductions of the PM and SO2 emissions from 2017 to 2020. With these adjustments, we derived an
estimated anthropogenic emission inventory for China in 2020. The model-simulated pollutant
concentrations using this inventory showed a reasonable agreement with the surface measurement
data during the period before the COVID-19 lockdown (Table S2, also see the Model evaluation
section below), which suggested the estimated emission inventory was reasonable.
Estimated reduction of anthropogenic emissions during the CLD period
We estimated the emission reductions during the COVID-19 lockdown period according to the
recent literature (Doumbia et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020). For the transportation
sector, the decrease in national traffic volume was estimated at 70% during the lockdown according
to transportation index data. The industry emissions were assumed to decrease by 40% across China.
The emissions of power plants were estimated to decrease by 30% due to the less consumption of
electricity. The emissions of residential activities were assumed to increase by 10% due to more
coal combustion and cooking. We kept the emissions from agriculture unchanged because they were
less affected by the city lockdowns. Fig. 4 presents the reductions of NOx, VOC, CO, PM, and SO2
emissions due to the changes in anthropogenic activities during the lockdown, which generally
match the estimation by Huang et al. (2020). The observed pollutant concentrations during the
lockdown period could faithfully captured by the CMAQ model using this estimated reduced
emissions (Table S2, also see the Model evaluation section below), which suggested the estimated
reductions of anthropogenic emissions were acceptable.

Statistical parameters were calculated to validate the model performance in simulating the air
pollutant concentrations from January 2 to February 12, 2020, including the mean observation
(OBS), mean simulation (SIM), mean bias (MB), mean absolute gross error (MAGE), root mean
square error (RMSE), index of agreement (IOA), and correlation coefficient (r). The equations of
these statistical parameters can be found in Fan et al. (2013).
Table S2 shows the evaluation results of the simulated concentrations of SO2, NO2, CO, O3
and PM2.5 in China for the periods before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, respectively. As the
measured NO2 by the catalytic conversion method in the national network overestimates the NO2
(Xu et al., 2013), we adjusted the observed NO2 data following the method proposed by Zhang et
al. (2017) and Fu et al. (2019). Generally, the CMAQ model faithfully reproduced the observed
concentrations of NO2, SO2, CO, PM2.5 and O3 with low biases during both peirods. The evaluation
results suggested reasonable estimations of the anthropogenic emissions for the year 2020 and
during the lockdown.
As we focused on the O3 changes in NC, CC, and SC regions, we futher evaluated the modeling
performace in simulating the variations of O3 and NO2 for these regions. Fig. S2 shows the time
series of simulated and observed O3 and NO2 mixing ratios. The magnitude and variation of the
observed NO2 mixing ratios for these three regions were all well captured by the CMAQ model.
The observed O3 mixing ratios for three regions were also reasonably reproduced. Both the
simulation and observation showed an O3 increase in NC and CC but a decrease in SC (also shown
in Fig. 3). However, the O3 mixing ratio in NC during the lockdown was underestimated, probably
due to the uncertainties in meteorological simulation. The O3 mixing ratio in SC was generally
overestimated during the simulation period, which might be attributed to the influence of the
overestimated O3 concentrations on the ocean. Nevertheless, the model was able to faithfully capture
the observed O3 variations in these three regions.
Overall, despite some uncertainties, the CMAQ model performance is acceptable and can
support further analysis of O3 changes during the COVID-19 city lockdowns.
