Abstract An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern
Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the
infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally
regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on
February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view
of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the
variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time,
the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and
infectious periods and the fatality rate.
First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters
and initial conditions (in order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one
exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate
the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constraint
the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day

37 (March 31) approximately, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.36 at day
22 and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death
toll is approximately 15600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end
of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is
4.25 days and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values
based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR)
is 0.57 %, and 2.37 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However,
these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times
more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of
the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of
lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a
higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 % versus 0.57
%), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set
of parameters also provide a good fit of the data, but some of the results may not be
realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics
of the epidemic is subject to the knowledge of precise bounds of the parameters.
Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation
measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, the importance to quantify the process to
verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.

1 Introduction
The most abundant species in nature are viruses, which are parasites, since they cannot
replicate themselves. Upon replication, some viruses cause serious infectious diseases in
human and/or animals and are medically, socially, and economically important (Spinney, 2017; Adachi, 2020). One of these species is coronavirus. An outbreak of pneumonia
caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) began (officially) in February 24, 2020, in
Northern Italy, and the number of the newly reported cases still increase. Approximately 29000 casualties are reported in Italy at the time of writing (May 5). The
serious danger COVID-19 poses is reflected in the high number of cases of transmission to health-care workers, more than 20 % in Italy. The experience in China showed
that the use of relative extreme isolation measures in conjunction with rapid diagnosis
has a strong impact on the dynamics of the epidemic; hence, the importance to understand and quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the isolation measures
(e.g., Chowell et al., 2003).
There is a long history of mathematical models in epidemiology, going back to the
eighteenth century. Bernoulli (1760) used a mathematical method to evaluate the ef-

3

fectiveness of the techniques of variolation against smallpox, with the aim of influencing
public health policy. Most of the models are compartmental models, with the population divided into classes and assumptions about the time rate of transfer from one
class to another (Hethcote, 2000; Brauer, 2017). We consider a Susceptible-ExposedInfectious-Removed (SEIR) model to describe the spread of the virus and compute
the number of infected and dead individuals. The SEIR model has many versions and
the mathematical treatment can be found, for instance, in Hethcote (2000), Keeling
and Rohani (2008) and Diekmann et al. (2013) among others. The goal is to compute
the number of infected, recovered and dead individuals on the basis of the number
of contacts, probability of the disease transmission, incubation period, recovery rate
and fatality rate. The epidemic disease model predicts a peak of infected and dead
individuals per day as a function of time, and assumes that births and natural deaths
are balanced, since we are dealing with a very short period of time. The population
members solely decrease due to the disease dictated by the fatality rate of the disease.
The differential equations are solved with a forward-Euler scheme.

2 Theory and differential equations
When no vaccine is available, the isolation of diagnosed infectives and social distancing
are the only control measures available. We consider an SEIR epidemic disease model
(e.g., Hethcote, 2000; Al-Showaikh and Twizell, 2004; Keeling and Rohani, 2008; Diekmann et al., 2013). The total (initial) population, N0 , is categorized in four classes,
namely, susceptible, S(t), exposed, E(t), infected-infectious, I(t) and recovered, R(t),
where t is the time variable. The governing differential equations are
SÃá = Œõ ‚àí ¬µS ‚àí Œ≤S
EÃá = Œ≤S

IÀô = E ‚àí (Œ≥ + ¬µ + Œ±)I,
RÃá = Œ≥I ‚àí ¬µR,
where N = S + E + I + R ‚â§ N0 in this case, and a dot above a variable denotes time
differentiation. Equations (1) are subject to the initial conditions S(0), E(0), I(0) and
R(0). The parameters are defined as:

Œõ: Per-capita birth rate.
¬µ: Per-capita natural death rate.

4

Œ±: Virus induced average fatality rate.
Œ≤: Probability of disease transmission per contact (dimensionless) times the
number of contacts per unit time.
: Rate of progression from exposed to infectious (the reciprocal is the incubation period).
Œ≥: Recovery rate of infectious individuals (the reciprocal is the infectious period).
having units of (1/T), with T: time. The scheme is illustrated in Figure 1. The choice
Œõ = ¬µ = 0 and  = ‚àû gives the classical SIR model (e.g., d‚ÄôOnofrio, 2015), while
if Œõ and ¬µ are not zero, the model is termed endemic SIR model (e.g., Allen. 2017).
However, the SIR model has no latent stage (no exposed individuals) and then it is
inappropriate as a model for diseases with an  such as that of the COVID-19.
Let us clarify better the meaning of each quantity. N is the total number of live humans
in the system at time t. S is the number of humans susceptible to be exposed and E is
the actual number of exposed individuals (a class in which the disease is latent, they are
infected but not infectious); people go from S to E depending on the number of contacts
with I individuals, multiplied by the probability of infection (Œ≤) (see Figure 1, where
Œ≤I/N is the average number of contacts with infection per unit time of one susceptible).
The other processes taking place at time t are: exposed (E) become infectious (I) with a
rate  and infectious recover (R) with a rate Œ≥. Recovered means individual who do not
flow back into the S class, as lifelong immunity is assumed, but it remains to be seen
whether the recovered patients from COVID-19 will develop antibodies and achieve
lifelong protection. The reciprocals ‚àí1 and Œ≥ ‚àí1 are the average disease incubation
and infectious periods, respectively.
Œõ is the rate of birth and ¬µ is the natural rate of death, both per unit time. The
reciprocal ¬µ‚àí1 , interpreted as the normal life expectancy (e.g., 70 yr), refers to average
normal deaths (e.g., natural deaths, by normal flu, accidents, etc), not related to the
infectious disease. These quantities describe a model with vital dynamics (endemic
model), which have an inflow of births into the S class at rate Œõ and deaths into the
other classes at rates ¬µS, ¬µI and ¬µR (see Figure 1). If Œõ = ¬µN , the deaths balance
the newborns. The number of live people at time t is N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t),
that can be lower or higher than N0 depending on the value of Œõ and ¬µ. In this case,
it is lower than N0 .
One of the key parameters, besides Œ≤, is Œ± that represents the disease-related fatality
rate (Chowell et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2013). In a very fast pandemic, we may assume
that there are no births and normal deaths (or they balance and Œõ = ¬µN ), but deaths
due to the fatality rate of the disease. This rate is an average, because the model does

5

not take into account the age (a far higher portion of old people die from the disease
than young people), the patients preexisting conditions and the healthcare quality.
In summary, susceptible persons enter the exposed class with a rate proportional to Œ≤
and remain there for a mean incubation period ‚àí1 , i.e., those already infected with
the disease but not able to transmit it are in the exposed class and progress to the
infectious class, to recover at the rate Œ≥ and die at the rate Œ±. It is important to recall
that the E class has not the symptoms of the disease, because they are incubating
it. They will have symptoms when they pass to class I. Individuals in class I may not
have symptoms (asymptomatic), but they are infectious, while those in class E are not.
Moreover, individuals in class E can move to R without showing symptoms, but they
are infectious when they are in class I.
The dead population as a function of time is D(t) = N0 ‚àí N (t), whereas the curve
giving the dead people per unit time is
DÃá(t) = ‚àíNÃá (t) = ‚àí(SÃá + EÃá + IÀô + RÃá)(t).

(2)

Another equivalent approach is an SEIDR model (e.g., De la Sen et al., 2017; Sameni,
2020), where we have to add
DÃá(t) = Œ±I(t)

(3)

to equations (1). In Keeling and Rohani (2008, Section 2.2), Œ±/(Œ≥ + ¬µ) = œÅ/(1 ‚àí œÅ),
where œÅ is the per capita probability of dying from the infection. It can easily be shown
that equations (2) and (3) are equivalent if births and natural deaths compensate.

2.1 Reproduction ratio
The basic reproduction ratio, R0 , is the classical epidemiological measure associated
with the reproductive power of the disease. For the SEIR model, it is
R0 =

Œ≤
( + ¬µ)(Œ≥ + Œ± + ¬µ)

(4)

(Diekmann et al, 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). It gives the average number of secondary
cases of infection generated by an infectious individual. Therefore, it is used to estimate
the growth of the virus outbreak. R0 provides a threshold for the stability of the diseasefree equilibrium point. When R0 < 1, the disease dies out; when R0 > 1, an epidemic
occurs. The behaviour of SEIR models as a function of R0 can be found, for instance,
in Al-Sheikh (2012).

6

2.2 Infection and case fatality rates
The infection fatality rate (IFR) is based on all the population that has been infected,
i.e., including the undetected individuals and asymptomatic. In terms of the recovery
and fatality rates, we have
IFR (%) = 100 ¬∑

D‚àû
,
R‚àû + D‚àû

(5)

since the total humans that have been infected is the sum of the recovered and dead
individuals, where the subscript refers to the end of the epidemic (t ‚Üí ‚àû). It can easily
be shown that using the last equation (1) and equation (3), we obtain
IFR (%) = 100 ¬∑

Œ±I‚àû
Œ±
Œ±
‚âà 100 ¬∑
‚âà 100 ¬∑ ,
(Œ± + Œ≥)I‚àû ‚àí ¬µR‚àû
Œ±+Œ≥
Œ≥

(6)

since the term containing ¬µ is much smaller, because ¬µ  Œ±  Œ≥, and equation (6) holds
approximately at all times, not only at the end of the epidemic. On the other hand,
the case fatality rate (CFR) considers the number of deaths related to the diagnosed
individuals, and it is always CFR > IFR, since the number of diagnosed individuals
is lower than the denominator of equation (5). The CFR is time dependent and is the
usually reported value.

3 Numerical algorithm
We solve the differential equations (1) by using a forward Euler finite-difference scheme
(e.g., Carcione, 2014), discretizing the time variable as t = ndt, where n is a natural
number and dt is the time step. Equations (1) and (2) become after discretization:

(7)

Rn+1 = Rn + dt (Œ≥I n ‚àí ¬µRn ) ,
DÃán = ‚àí(SÃá n + EÃá n + IÀôn + RÃán )(t),
where DÃán is the number of dead people only in the specific day n. This algorithm
yields positive and bounded solutions [e.g., see Brauer (2017) and Problem 1.42(iv) in
Diekmann et al. (2013)], and the system converges to an equilibrium, i.e., S n + Rn +
Dn = S‚àû + R‚àû + D‚àû = N0 for t ‚Üí ‚àû.

4 Results
Let us consider the following base parameters as an example to analyze the results by
varying some of them. N0 = 10 million, Œ± = 0.006/day, Œ≤ = 0.75/day, Œ≥ = (1/8)/day,
 = (1/3)/day, Œõ = ¬µN (balance of births and natural deaths); and initial conditions:
S(0) = N0 ‚àí E(0) ‚àí 1, E(0) = 20000, I(0) = 1 and R(0) = 0. These data is taken
from Chowell et al. (2003, Table 1) for SARS and implies an average disease incubation
(latent period) of 3 days and an infectious period of 8 days. The data correspond to no
isolation conditions among individuals and an epidemic situation (high Œ≤, R0 = 5.72 >
1).
The time step of the Euler scheme to solve the discretized equations (7) is dt = 0.01
day. Figure 2 shows the number of individuals in the different classes (a), and the
total number of dead people (D) and the number of dead people per specific day (DÃá)
(b). As can be seen, the peak of dead individuals per day is reached at day 30. The
high values in Figure 2b do not consider complete home isolation and social distancing
measures (or ‚Äúsuppression‚Äù). The maximum number of infected individuals is almost
4 million. According to data from China, around 5 % of people who tested positive
to COVID-19 experience severe symptoms and require admission to an intensive-care
unit, almost 200 thousands individuals in this case. Then, the health system would be
completely overwhelmed with very high death rates and inability to provide intensive
care. A partial ‚Äúmitigation‚Äù strategy involving social distancing (home isolation of
suspect cases and social distancing of the elderly) would not be enough, and a severe
lockdown is required in order to decrease R0 possibly less than 1 (Ferguson et al.,
2020).
Hereafter, we vary the parameters and plot the infected (I) individuals, i.e., excluding
those who are incubating the disease (E). In order the process to start, there should
be at least one exposed or one infectious individual. Figure 3 shows the number of
infected individuals for R0 > 1 (a) and R0 ‚â§ 1 (b), where all the other parameters are
kept constant unless Œ≤, that takes the value
Œ≤ ‚âà (Œ≥ + Œ±)R0 ,

(8)

for ¬µ much smaller than Œ≥ and Œ± (¬µ‚àí1 ‚âà 83 yr in Italy). We recall here that Œ≤ is
the probability of transmission times the number of contacts per unit time. Basically,
reducing Œ≤ (and R0 ) the peak decreases in intensity but moves to later times for R0
higher than 1 (Figure 3a), although it is wider. There is a significant reduction in the
number of infected individuals for R0 ‚â§ 1, meaning that strict home isolation is very
effective below a given threshold.

8

The effect of the initially exposed individuals are shown in Figure 4 for two sets of
values of R0 , greater (a) and less (b) than 1. Figure 4a indicates that more exposed
people does not mainly affects the intensity of the peak, but anticipates the spread of
the epidemic, so that the location of the peak is highly dependent on E(0). On the
other hand, Figure 4b shows that for R0 < 1, the peak location does not change but
its intensity does it significantly, indicating an effective ‚Äúsuppression‚Äù of the epidemic,
with more exposed, more infectious. Figure 5 indicates that the incubation period (1/)
has also an impact on the results. If R0 > 1 (5a), increasing the period from 3 to 9 days
decreases the maximum number of infected individuals by almost half and delays the
spread of the epidemic, but the peak is wider. If R0 < 1, the curves behave similarly,
but there are much less infected cases. The initially infectious individuals (from one to
ten thousand) has no apparent effect on the results, as can be seen in Figure 6, but
this is not the case when we deal with the real case history (see next subsection). The
effects of the infectious period are shown in Figure 7, where, as expected, increasing
this quantity delays the epidemic when R0 > 1. Below R0 = 1, the number of infected
individuals decreases substantially.
Let us assume now that isolation precautions have been imposed and after day 22 R0
changes from 5.72 to 0.1 [a change of Œ≤ according to equation (8)], and consider the
same parameters to produce Figure 2. The results are shown in Figure 8, where the
peak has moved from day 30 to day 25, with a significant slowing in the number of
new cases. The total number of dead individuals has decreased, and the number of
dead individuals per day at the peak has decreased from 22 K to 13 K, approximately.
Extreme isolation after imperfect isolation anticipates the process. Figure 9 shows the
results if the isolation measures start two days before, at day 20 instead of day 22. The
number of casualties decreased from 220 K to 155 K.

4.1 The Lombardy case
Next, we attempt to model the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy (Italy), where the
data is available at https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19. The time of writing is
day 72 (May 5) and the availability of data allows us to perform a relatively reliable fit
of the total number casualties from day 1 to date. On day 69 (May 2), 329 casualties
were reported of which 282 are equally distributed in April, since this number is a late
report of the hospitals, corresponding to the whole month of April. To predict with
high accuracy the behaviour of the epidemic is nearly impossible due to many unknown
factors, e.g., the degree of spacial distancing, lack of knowledge of the probability of
the disease transmission, characteristics of the disease and parameters of the epidemic.
Uncertainties are related to the parameter Œ≤ that varies with time, while the others

9

are assumed to lie between certain bounds and also contribute to the error. Relative
predictions of the trend require an analysis of the data, particularly to define the
variation of Œ≤ and R0 with time. We do not assume a specific continuous function,
but a general approach should consider a partition into discrete periods, [t0 , t1 ], [t1 ,
t2 ] . . . [tL‚àí1 , ‚àû], guided by the measures taken by the state and the behaviour of the
population. In this case, t0 = 1 day, t1 = 22 day and t2 = 35 day, i.e., L = 3, since after
t1 (March 16), home isolation, social distancing and partial Nation lockdown started
to be effective, as indicated by an inflection point in the curve of casualties per day
(see below), although it is debatable that the Italian government followed the same
rules as in Wuhan, China. We also observe that at t2 (March 29), the curve starts to
bend downwards and reach a ‚Äúpeak‚Äù. This partition in three periods is valid to date,
but the trend can have an unpredictable behavior due to the factors mentioned above,
a too early removal of the lockdown conditions, etc.
The reported infected people cannot be used for calibration, because these data cannot
be trusted. The hospitalization numbers cannot be considered to be representative of
the number of infected people and it is largely unknown at present the number of
asymptomatic, undiagnosed infections. However, we are aware that even using the
number of casualties is uncertain, since there can be an under-ascertainment of deaths,
but the figures cannot vary as much as the error related to the infected individuals.
Hence, the reported number of deceased people could possibly be underestimated due
to undeclared cases. This number depends on the country (quality of the health system)
and average age of the population, but it is certain that this novel virus is more deadly
and spreads more quickly than seasonal flu. Moreover, authorities make a distinction
between a death occurred ‚Äúwith the co-action‚Äù of the virus and the death ‚Äúcaused by‚Äù
the virus. Indeed, only a small percentage of the casualties were in healthy conditions
prior the infection and most of the patients were already affected by other illnesses
(eg. diabetes, dementia, cancer, stroke). Therefore, we also consider cases where 100 %
more people have actually died per day, compared to the official figures.
In order to accomplish the fit, we use the simulated annealing algorithm developed
by Goffe et al. (1994). The Fortran code can be found in: https://econwpa.ub.
uni-muenchen.de/econ-wp/prog/papers/9406/9406001.txt. The fit is based on the
L2 -norm and yields Œ±, Œ≤1 (before t0 ), Œ≤2 (after t0 ), Œ≤3 (after t1 ), , E(0) and Œ≥ from
the beginning of the epidemic (day 1, February 24) to date (day 72, May 5), i.e., seven
free parameters. We use the total number of deaths for the calibration.
Table 1 shows the constraints, initial values and results for different cases, where Cases 1
and 2 correspond to approximately nine times less exposed individuals at the beginning
of the epidemic, and Cases 2 and 3 assume double casualties. Cases 4 and 5 consider a

10

wider range of the lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods
(‚àí1 and Œ≥ ‚àí1 ). The last column do not correspond to variables but indicates the
infected individuals at the end of the epidemic, i.e., I‚àû = R‚àû + D‚àû ‚âà R‚àû and the
day of the last infected individual (the end of the epidemic in theory). The results are
very sensitive to variations of the parameter Œ≤, and consequently those of R0 , mostly
due to the impact of the performed intervention strategies.
Figure 10 shows the curves of Case 1 compared to the data (black dots), with IFR
= 0.57 % and R0 decreasing from 3 to 0.8 at the end of the epidemic. The final
infected individuals are 2.69 million people (see Figure 11a and Table 1). The peak
value of the I class is 0.3 M or 300 thousand individuals. If 5 % of these people require
admission to an intensive-care unit (ICU), it amounts to 15000 individuals and largely
exceeds the capacity of Lombardy, which was approximately 1000 ICU at March 16.
Figure 11b compares the infectious and dead individuals (per day) and, as expected,
the two curves are synchronous, since a proportion Œ± of infectious individuals die. The
inflection point at day 22 (Figure 10b) indicates that the isolation measures started
to be effective. Strict isolation could not be achieved at day 22 due to several reasons
and there is a reasonable delay of a few days before it can be implemented (day 35).
The total number of casualties is approximately 15600 and the effective duration of the
epidemic is about 100 days. However, see the last column indicating the day when the
last individual is infected, obtained with the condition I < 1. Recent data reveal that
the effective duration of the Wuhan epidemic was almost 60 days (Wu et al., 2020, Fig.
1b), a shorter period favoured by the very strict isolation measures applied in that city.
Case 2, that considers twice more casualties, and whose results are shown in Figure 12,
has a high fatality rate, IFR = 2.37 %, but 1.33 million infected people. If the exposed
individuals are much higher (Case 3), we obtain IFR = 0.47 % and 6.5 million infected
people (see Figures 13 and 14 and Table 1), but in this case, the fit is not optimal at
the beginning of the epidemic. The calculations indicate the uncertainty related to the
initially exposed individuals, i.e., those that are incubating the disease.
In the following, we do not show the plots, but the results honour the data. If we modify
the constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds, the results are those
of Cases 4 and 5 in Table 1. Case 4 has slightly higher incubation and infectious periods
compared to Case 1, but a higher IFR (2.25 % versus 0.57 %), whereas more exposed
individuals yield an incubation period of 13 days and lower IFR (Case 5). Case 6
considers that initially there are a few exposed individuals (we start with one). The
algorithm gives a very good fit of the data with IFR = 3.6 %, comparable periods to
Case 1 and 0.44 M infected individuals. Case 7, that considers I(0) = 1 and starts with
one exposed individual, has a good fit, but IFR is too high, possibly wrong, indicating

11

that at day 1 there were more exposed and infectious individuals. Less initially exposed
and infectious individuals requires a higher IFR to fit the curve, but also a higher R0
could have the same effect if the IFR is kept within a realistic range. Finally, we
constraint the incubation and infectious periods between 10 and 20 days, and the
results are those of Cases 8 and 9 assuming different initially exposed individuals. The
calculations yield fatality rates comparable to that of SARS (Chowell et al., 2003),
as Case 6. These calculations indicate the uncertainty in the determination of the
parameters of the epidemic, but the solutions has to be restricted to reasonable values
of the properties of the disease and parameters of the epidemic.
The values in Table 1 can be compared to figures reported in the literature. The fatality
rate and IFR depend on the age of the population. Verity et al. (2020, Table 1) estimate
for China an IFR = 0.657 % but over 60 yr age this rate is 3.28 %. If the number of
infected people is several times higher than the reported cases, the fatality rate could
be considerably less than the official one, suggesting that this disease is less deadly
than SARS and MERS, although much more contagious. Read et al. (2020) report a
mean value R0 = 4, while Wu et al. (2020) obtain values between 1.8 and 2. According
to Chowell et al. (2003), IFR = 4.8 % for SARS, and Verity et al. (2020) state that
the average case fatality rate (CFR) of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19, with
the latter approximately 1.38 % (their IFR is 0.657 %). However, this virus seems to
be much more contagious. The meaning of Œ±‚àí1 is the life expectancy of an individual
in the infectious class, i.e, if Œ± = 0.00144/day (Case 1), the expectancy is 694 days.

4.2 Further comments
There are more complex versions of the SEIR model as, for instance, including a quarantine class and a class of isolated (hospitalized) members (Brauer and Castillo-Chavez,
2012), or generalizing the diffusion equations (1) with the use of temporal fractional
derivatives. The replacement of the first-order temporal derivative by a Caputo fractional derivative of non-natural order provides an additional parameter to fit the data
(e.g., Caputo et al., 2011; Mainardi, 2010; Chen et al., 2020). Furthermore, the model
can be made two-dimensional by including the spatial diffusion of the virus (e.g., Naheed et al., 2014). An alternative to spatial diffusion models are contact networks. The
actual compartmental network through which the disease spreads is a very important
part of epidemic spreading. The model used in this study is a homogeneous approximation to these network models (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001; Montakhab
and Manshour, 2012; Pastor-Satorras et al., 2015).
Moreover, the model can be improved by including others classes. De la Sen et al.
(2017) propose an SEIADR model, where A are asymptomatic infectious and D are

12

are dead-infective. In other models, recovered can become again susceptible (e.g., Xia
et al., 2016) and, in addition, there are stochastic models (Allen, 2017), although
the calibration becomes extremely difficult with the incomplete data provided by the
authorities and the high number of parameters to be found. At the end of the epidemic,
more precise information about the parameters will be available and the complete data
can be used to evaluate the development of Œ≤ (and R0 ) with time.
The outbreak of a pandemic can have catastrophic consequences, not only from the
point of view of the casualties, but also economically. Therefore, it is essential to absolutely avoid it by taking the necessary measures at the right time, something that has
not been accomplished in Italy and the rest of the world. According to these calculations, the effective measures are social distancing and home isolation, since there is no
health system designed for ordinary circumstances that can be prepared for a pandemic,
when the infected individuals grows exponentially. As can be seen, the pandemic can
develop in a few days and the number of casualties can be extremely high if the fatality
rate and contagiousness of the disease are high. Only a few days to take action can make
a big difference in the prevention of this disaster. The pandemic and its consequences
have been predicted in October 2019 by a group of experts (https://www.politico.
com/news/magazine/2020/03/07/coronavirus-epidemic-prediction-policy-advice-121172),
but states ignored the fact and transnational nature of the threat, delaying the necessary measures to avoid the disaster, minimizing in many cases the downsides to their
own populations and economies. Moreover, in less than three weeks, the virus has overloaded the health-care system over northern Italy, in particular Lombardy, where the
system cannot support this type of emergency and the authorities are not prepared to
deal with the epidemic.

5 Conclusions
A high number of secondary infections by COVID-19 can take place when an infected
individual is introduced into a community. It is essential to simulate the process of
infection (and death) in advance, to apply adequate control measures and mitigate the
risk of virus diffusion. One of the most used mathematical algorithms to describe the
diffusion of an epidemic disease is the SEIR model, that we have applied to compute
the number of infected, recovered and dead individuals on the basis of the number
of contacts, probability of the disease transmission, incubation and infectious periods,
and disease fatality rate.
A first analysis of the results of the model is based on parameters of the SARS disease
and we assume that the parameters do not change during the whole epidemic. Reducing
the number of contacts, the peak decreases in intensity but moves to later times,

13

although it is wider. Moreover, more exposed people does not affect the intensity of
the peak, but anticipates the epidemic. The incubation period has also an impact on
the results, with higher values delaying the epidemic. The dependence on the initial
number of infected people is weak apparently if R0 does not change during the epidemic.
Increasing the infectious period has the opposite effect of increasing the incubation
period. Moreover, the day when the isolation starts is important, since only two days
makes a big difference in the number of casualties.
The Lombardy modeling assumes ten million of individuals and has been calibrated
on the basis of the total number of casualties. The results show that the peak occurs
after 37 days with a final number of dead individuals depending on the reproduction
ratio R0 . With the present available data, this number is approximately 15600. Up
to day 72 (May 5, the day of writing), the reproduction ratio is 3 before March 16
(day 22), 1.36 [between March 16 and March 29 (day 35)] and 0.8 after March 29,
whereas the fatality rate is 0.00144/day (IFR = 0.57 %). We have also doubled the
number of casualties and obtained IFR = 2.37 % and 0.47 %, with the second value
corresponding to nine times more exposed individuals. These values are obtained by
constraining the incubation and infectious periods to values reported in the literature.
If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds, we
obtain slightly higher incubation and infectious periods compared to the first case,
but a much higher IFR (2.25 % versus 0.57 %), while much more exposed individuals
yields an incubation period of 13 days and a lower IFR (0.6 %). Of the many solutions
that honour the data, we suggest to consider as more realistic ones those which agree
with the experimental data published at present, based on the reported incubation and
infection periods and IFR. The uncertainty is due to the novelty of the virus, whose
properties were unknown two months ago, and to the initial conditions, i.e., the initially
exposed and infectious individuals.
The present data fit and consequent prediction of the epidemic does not take into
account the second phase established by the state, which started on May 4. After the
partial opening of the economy and under a less stringent lockdown, the reproduction
number could increase and induce a second outbreak of the epidemic. Therefore, a
precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the parameters
of the epidemic and characteristics of the disease, and it is clear from these calculations
that the usefulness of simple models to predict is limited, and that their main role is
to help in our understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic.
Models can be used to predict and understand how an infectious disease spreads in
the world and how various factors affect the dynamics. Even if the predictions are
inaccurate, it has been clear to scientists from many decades to date that quarantine,

14

social distancing and the adoption of very strict health and safety standards are essential to stop the spreading of the virus. Quarantine was even implemented in medieval
times to fight the black death before knowing the existence of viruses. In this sense,
this pandemic reveals the failure of policy makers, since it is well known from basic
modeling results that anticipating those measures can save thousand of lives and even
prevent the pandemic. The interface of science, society and politics is still uneasy, even
in highly developed countries, revealing a disregard for scientific evidence. Moreover,
one of the consequences is that some of these countries do not invest sufficiently in
R&D and must acquire the new technology overseas at a much higher cost.

Manuscript contribution to the field: We implement an SEIR model to evaluate the
date of the infection peak of the COVID-19 epidemic, that includes the disease fatality
rate to estimate the number of casualties per day. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that this model is calibrated with the number of casualties. The simulation attempts
to provide a simple procedure to model the coronavirus diffusion in a given region. The
example regards the epidemic in the Lombardy province (Italy) which is taking place
at the time of this writing, but can be applied in general. We show how the date of
the peak and the number of casualties are affected by the effectiveness of the home
isolation, incubation and infectious periods, probability of transmission and initially
exposed individuals. The results from the procedure, that intends to be the basis for
a real case study, where it is clear the effect of each parameter and variable in the
dynamic evolution of the epidemic.
