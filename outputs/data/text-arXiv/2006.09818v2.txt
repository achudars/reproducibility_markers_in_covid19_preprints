An analytic solution is obtained to the SEIR Epidemic Model. The solution is created by constructing a
single second-order nonlinear differential equation in ln S and analytically continuing its divergent power
series solution such that it matches the correct long-time exponential damping of the epidemic model. This
is achieved through an asymptotic approximant (Barlow et. al, 2017, Q. Jl Mech. Appl. Math, 70 (1), 21-48)
in the form of a modified symmetric Padé approximant that incorporates this damping. The utility of the
analytical form is demonstrated through its application to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Asymptotic approximants have been successful at providing analytical solutions to many problems in mathematical physics1–8 . Like the well-known Padé approximant9,10 , they are constructed to match a primary series
expansion in a given region up to any specified order. Unlike Padé approximants, however, the form of an asymptotic approximant is not limited to a ratio of polynomials, and its structure is chosen to enforce the asymptotic
equivalence in a region away from the primary series expansion. By increasing the number of terms in an asymptotic approximant, it converges to the exact solution in
these two regions – as well as at all points in between.
Convergence is certainly a necessary condition for a valid
approximant; although there is yet no proof, convergent
approximants match the numerical solutions of systems
examined thus far1–8 .
The COVID-19 outbreak motivates the application of
asymptotic approximants to epidemiology models. The
method has seen recent success in providing a closed-form
solution to the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR)
model8 . Here, we extend the method to the commonly
used Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered (SEIR)
model. This model is formulated as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, for which no exact
analytic solution has yet been found. The analytic nature
of the asymptotic approximant derived in what follows is
advantageous, in that the accuracy and computational
expense are not affected by the duration of the epidemic
prediction; the form is built such that it is accurate in
t ∈ [0, ∞) and can be evaluated at any specific time without the need for numerical marching. Depending on the
duration, it may be beneficial to replace a numerical solution with the approximant within a fitting algorithm
that extracts SEIR parameters. En route to the approximant, we also present an alternative formulation of the
SEIR model as a single 2nd-order nonlinear differential
equation in ln S. This form enables an efficient series solution about t = 0, asymptotic expansion as t → ∞, and
may itself prove attractive for future analysis.

The SEIR epidemic model considers the time-evolution
of a susceptible population, S(t), interacting with an exposed population, E(t), and infected population, I(t),
where t is time. This model is expressed as11

and constraints
S = S0 , E = E0 , I = I0 , R = R0 at t = 0.

(1e)

In (1), β, α, γ, S0 , E0 , I0 , and R0 are non-negative
constant parameters11. Along with initial conditions
from (1e), the solution for S, E, and I may be first obtained from (1a) through (1c) and the solution for R
subsequently extracted using (1d).
We now manipulate the system (1) into an equivalent
2nd-order equation in ln S to simplify the analysis that
follows. Equations (1a) and (1b) are added to obtain

where ǫ1 and ǫ2 are unknown constants and λ2 < λ1 < 0

f ∼ f∞ + ǫ1 eλ1 t , t → ∞.

a2 = [C − (α + γ) a1 + αβS0 − αγa0 ] /2

(10a)

We expand f as t → ∞ as follows:

(8d)

as seen by adding equations (1a) through (1d), integrating in t, and applying (1e).

The result (9) is obtained by the standard procedure of
inserting (9a) into (7) and finding a recursion for the coefficients by equating like-terms. It is thus necessary to
obtain the expansion of the nonlinear term ef ≡
PS inn(7).
To do so, we solve for the coefficients of S =
ãn t by
applying Cauchy’s product rule to the chain-rule result
f ′ S = S ′ and evaluating like-terms; this leads to the
recursive expression given by (9d). Although the series
solution given by (9) is an analytic solution to (7), it is
only valid within its radius of convergence and is incapable of capturing the long-time behavior of the system.
This motivates the use of an approximant to analytically
continue the series beyond this radius.
The long-time asymptotic behavior of the system (7)
is required to develop our asymptotic approximant, and
so we proceed as follows. It has been proven in prior
literature12 that S approaches a limiting value, S∞ , as
t → ∞, and this corresponds to I → 0 in the same limit.
Thus, f approaches a limiting value, f∞ ≡ ln S∞ , as
t → ∞. The value of f∞ satisfies the following equation12

Higher order corrections to the expansion (14) may be
obtained by the method of dominant balance10 as a series of more rapidly damped exponentials. However, the
pattern by which the corrections are asymptotically ordered is not as straightforward as that of the SIR model,

3
provided in Barlow and Weinstein 8 . In that work, an
asymptotic approximant is constructed as a series of exponentials that exactly mimics the long-time expansion.
In the SEIR model, complications in the higher-order
asymptotic behavior arise from the competition between
the two exponentials in (13a). Here, we enforce the
leading-order t → ∞ behavior given by (14) and make
a more traditional choice for matching with the t = 0 expansion (9). We create an approximant with an embedded rational function with equal-order numerator and denominator (i.e., a symmetric Padé approximant10 ), such
that it approaches the unknown constant ǫ1 in (14) as
t → ∞, while converging to the intermediate behavior at
shorter times. The assumed SEIR approximant is given

where the An and Bn coefficients are obtained such that
the Taylor expansion of (15) about t = 0 is exactly (9).
Note that, although a rational function is being used
in (15), it is not a Padé approximant itself. Padé approximants are only capable of capturing tn behavior in the
long-time limit, where n is an integer. The pre-factor eλ1 t
is required to make (15) an asymptotic approximant for
the SEIR model. However, we may still make use of fast
Padé coefficient solvers14,15 by recasting (15) as a Padé
approximant for the series that results from the Cauchy

where ã0 = a0 − f∞ and ãn>0 = an>0 . A MATLAB code
to compute the An and Bn coefficients of (15) (for given
α, γ, β, S0 , E0 , I0 ) is available from the authors16 .
The SEIR approximant (15) is thus an analytic expression that, by construction, matches the correct t → ∞
behavior given by (14) and whose expansion about t = 0
is exact to N th-order. A comparison between the approximant solution (15) and the numerical solution to (1) is
provided in figures 1-4 with the relative error for all four
cases provided in figure 5. The indicated error in figure 5
is calculated by comparing S(t) to its accurate numerical
solution (assumed to be exact); curves showing the same
order of accuracy are obtained when the other dependent
variables of the model are examined.
Figure 1a provides a typical comparison of the N -term
series solution (9) denoted by fS,N (dashed lines), the
N -term approximant (15) denoted by fA,N (solid lines),

and the numerical solution (•’s). Note that the series
solution has a finite radius of convergence as evidenced
by the poor agreement and divergence from the numerical solution at larger times, even as additional terms
are included. By contrast, the approximant converges
as additional terms are included. For N = 18, the approximant is visibly indistinguishable from the numerical
solution on the scale of figure 1a. Figure 5a provides the
relative error of the approximant for the data shown in
figure 1. Increasing the number of terms beyond N = 18
does improve accuracy up to a point, but a minimum error barrier is eventually reached of O(10−6 ) at N = 26;
note that, to make this assessment, we take the maximum
relative error with respect to time for each N (the maxima in figure 5a). For larger values of N , the maximum
error increases, and the approximant begins to diverge,
i.e. there is an optimal value of N at which to truncate
the approximant. Asymptotic approximants can exhibit
an optimal truncation6,7 as is often observed with asymptotic expansions in general10. We emphasize here that a
numerical solution is not needed to assess convergence
of approximants to within their optimal truncation; convergence in the Cauchy sense (i.e., the distance between
approximants decreases with increasing N ) may be examined. In addition to this issue, deficient approximants
are possible with increasing N due to zeros that can arise
in the denominator of (15). Such approximants are ignored in assessing convergence. To avoid this behavior,
the lowest number of terms that yields the desired accuracy should be chosen. The convergence of the approximant with increasing N (up until its optimal truncation)
is a necessary condition for a valid approximant. In figure 1b, the converged (N = 18) asymptotic approximant
for f is used to obtain analytic solutions for S, E, I, and
R from (8), which are compared with the numerical solution for these quantities. The approximant for N = 18
agrees with numerics within the visible scale of the plot,
with errors quantified by figure 5a.
Figure 1 results described above correspond to a case
examined in Rachah and Torres 13 to model an Ebola
outbreak. In figures 2, 3, and 4, the approximant is applied to COVID-19 data17 for Yunan (China), Sweden,
and Japan, respectively. Figure 5b-d provide the relative error for these cases; the largest indicated value
of N in each figure (corresponding to dashed curves) is
the optimal truncation as discussed above for figure 5a.
Note that we extensively surveyed the available COVID19 data17 , and the results in figures 2-5 are representative of the fits and variability in the number of terms
needed for convergence of the approximant up to its optimal truncation.
Note that the reported COVID-19 outbreak data17 is
provided in terms of confirmed cases, recovered individuals, and deaths per day. We use recovered + deaths as
an approximation to the removed population R and use
confirmed − recovered − deaths as an approximation to
I in the SEIR model. It is acknowledged that the actual COVID-19 data is influenced by effects not included

FIG. 5. Relative error of the approximant (15) for increasing N as a function of t (in days). The exact solution is taken to
be the numerical solution of (1), computed using the 4th-order Runge–Kutta scheme with a time-step of 10−4 . The subfigures

of (SA,N − Sexact ) changes.

in the SEIR model, and this can affect the ability of the
model to closely fit actual COVID-19 data. The data approximations made here are to enable comparisons with
model predictions. The ability of the approximant to
match numerical results is unaffected by such approximations. Disagreement between the model and epidemic
data after fitting is attributed to the applicability of the
SEIR model and not the approximant.
In figures 2-4, a least squares fit to I and R data is
used to extract SEIR parameters α, β, γ and initial conditions S0 and E0 . To do so, the initial values of I0 and
R0 are taken directly from the COVID-19 data set17 . Ad-

ditionally, the time t = 0 is chosen such that disease has
progressed to a point where initial trends are observed,
so that curve shapes are consistent with those reasonably predicted by the SEIR model. Adjustments such
as this have been well described in fits done in previous work18,19 . The initial guesses for the iterative leastsquares fit are taken from data fits for earlier times than
examined here18,19 .
Our results demonstrate that an asymptotic approximant can be used to provide accurate analytic solutions
to the SEIR model. Future work should examine the
ability of the asymptotic approximant technique to yield

7
closed-form solutions for even more sophisticated epidemic models, as well as their endemic counterparts12 .
