Abstract
The outbreak of COVID-19, i.e., a variation of coronavirus, also known as novel
coronavirus causing respiratory disease, is a big concern worldwide since the end
of December 2019. As of September 12, 2020, it has turned into an epidemic
outbreak with more than 29 million confirmed cases and around 1 million reported deaths worldwide. It has created an urgent need to monitor and forecast
COVID-19 spread behavior to better control this spread. Among all the popular models for COVID-19 forecasting, statistical models are receiving much
attention in media. However, statistical models show less accuracy for longterm forecasting, as there is a high level of uncertainty, and the required data
is also not sufficiently available. This paper proposes a comparative analysis of
deep learning models to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak as an alternative to
statistical models. We propose a new Attention-based encoder-decoder model
named Attention-Long Short Term Memory (AttentionLSTM). LSTM based
neural network layer architecture incorporates the idea of fine-grained attention
mechanism, i.e., attention on hidden state dimensions instead of hidden state
vector itself, highlighting the importance and contribution of each hidden state
dimension. It is helpful in detection and focuses on crucial temporal information, resulting in a highly interpretable network. Additionally, we implement a
learnable vector embedding for time. As, time in a vector representation can

be easily added with many architectures. This vector representation is called
Time2Vec. This deep learning model forecasts the COVID-19 epidemic trend in
Europe’s most affected countries, i.e., Italy, Spain, France; and a North American country, i.e.,Canada. We have used the COVID-19 data repository by the
Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University to assess the proposed model’s performance. The proposed model gives
superior forecasting accuracy compared to other existing methods.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of COVID-19 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1]. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared a global public health
emergency. Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae and are widely
distributed to humans and other mammals [2]. The infection’s main symptoms
are dry cough, high fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, odor, and pulmonary
embolism in the most severe cases, similar symptoms induced by SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV [2, 3]. Many people may experience other symptoms, such as
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some patients reported radiation changes in
their ground glass lungs, normal or lower levels of white blood corpuscles, lymphocyte, platelet count, hypoxemia, liver function, and confusion. Few infected
people are asymptomatic also. Most of them are said to be linked locally to Huanan’s maritime market, where journalists claimed that they are selling freshly
slaughtered animals. A Chinese health official said that these patients initially
tested negative for viral and bacterial respiratory infections but later tested positive for coronavirus (nCoV) in the novel [4]. Initial findings suggested that the
virus was not spreading person to person. It was then later confirmed in [4] that
the virus spreads from person to person. It has been an epidemic of more than
15 million confirmed diseases and more than 6,000 deaths worldwide from July
22, 2020. Coronavirus was first discovered in 1965. Since then, there have been
three outbreaks of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) out-

2

break in China [5, 6], the 2012 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS) in Saudi Arabia [6, 7], and the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea
[8, 9]. The outbreak resulted in more than 8000 and 2200 confirmed cases of
SARS and MERS, respectively. COVID-19 is caused by a new gene similar to
the virus that causes SARS and MERS. Although the spread of COVID-19 has
a lower mortality rate than the outbreak of SARS and MERS [4], it is spreading
faster and infecting more people than the outbreak of SARS and MERS [4].
There were strict measures taken in Wuhan, China region to minimize the
spread; still, the infection spread globally and turned into an international pandemic. There are differences in the number of certified cases due to differences
in surveillance and detection capabilities and acquisitions between countries.
Despite all efforts, however, it seems that the disease has spread worldwide
today.
Since there is no cure or vaccine around to fight this virus yet, the health
infrastructure and services need excellent planning. It can help in controlling
the rate of disease spread. Thus, the total confirmed cases’ estimation is essential for handling the healthcare system’s demand and setting up new medical
infrastructure. Various mathematical, statistical, and machine learning modeling techniques can be used to estimate short and long-term infected cases,
which can help in effective planning and the number of additional materials and
resources required to cope with the outbreak. This estimation of the healthcare system’s anticipated burden is essential to timely and effectively manage
the medical facilities and other needful resources to fight the pandemic. Such
estimates can guide the severity and the number of measures needed to bring
down the outbreak. In [10], a new mathematical model of COVID-19 has been
introduced with a lock-down effect. The authors [11] analyzed and predicted
COVID-19, which is widespread in China, Italy, and France. They said to find
a significant drop in rising and death rates, and the infection spread should
be reduced at a fast rate. [12] used a mathematical model and forecasted the
COVID-19 cases in Mexico. For South Africa, Turkey, and Brazil, the peak
outbreak of epidemic is forecasted by analysis in [13] In early days of pandemic,
3

people made efforts to estimate key parameters and predict the cases in future.
Statistical models [14, 15] are mostly used for this. Recently, various mathematical methods such as time series models [16], multivariate linear regression
[17], and backpropagation neural networks [18, 19, 20] were used to predict
epidemic cases. Machine Learning (ML) has recently become famous for creating predictable models for COVID-19, as the disease spreads to be complex
and large scaled in nature. ML aims at creating high-performance models with
higher generalization ability and greater forecasting accuracy for longer leadtimes [21]. Although ML methods have been used to illustrate previous epidemics (e.g. Ebola, Cholera, swine fever, H1N1 influenza, dengue fever, Zika,
oyster norovirus [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], there is a gap in the literature
for peer-reviewed paper manuscripts provided to COVID-19. Table 1 shows the
different ML and statistical models used to predict the COVID-19 epidemic.
These methods are inhibited to ARIMA bases, random forest, neural networks,
Bayesian networks , Naive Bayes, genetic programming and classification and
regression tree (CART).
Another class of models known as deep learning models can capture nonlinear characteristics of a time series data. These models have a unique capability to capture the hidden features in the time series. One of the robust
networks to handle sequence dependence in time-series data is Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs). The LSTM network [34, 35] is a special kind of RNN used in
deep learning to train extensive architectures successfully. LSTMs are specially
designed to handle the long-term dependency problem. The default behavior of
the LSTM network recalls information for a long period. This paper presents a
novel attention mechanism using a sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) model. The
Seq2Seq model is a deep neural network model based on LSTM units. The paper
is organized as follows. Sections 2 contains the essential theoretical background
of methodologies used. Section 3 includes the data description and analysis.
Section 4 discusses the comparative studies about the experimental results, and
section 5 discusses an outlook of conclusions.

2. Preliminaries
2.1. LSTM Network
LSTM is a unique type of RNN, having the ability to remember long-term
temporal dependencies. The default property of these networks is to remember information for long periods of time. All the RNNs consist of a chain-like
structure having repeating loops of the neural network. These loops help the
network to retain the information in them.
For an input sequence x1 , x2 , ..., xt , where xi ∈ Rn , LSTM calculates ht ∈
Rm for each time step, t. The recurrent function of LSTM cell can be defined
as follows:
ht , ct = F (ht−1 , ct−1 , xt )
That can be defined by the following equations:

5

(1)

ft = σ(Wf (ht−1 , xt ) + bf )

(2)

it = σ(Wi .[ht−1 , xt ] + bi )

(3)

c̃ = tanh(Wc .[ht−1 , xt ] + bc )

(4)

ct = ft

Ct−1 + it

c̃

ot = σ(Wo .[ht−1 , xt ] + b0 )
ht = ot

tanh(ct )

Where ft , it , c̃, ct and ot ∈ Rm , Wf , Wi , Wc and Wo ∈ Rm×n , and

represent

the element-wise product.
2.2. Basic Attention Mechanism
Bahdanau et al. first proposed the basic attention [36] mechanism. It calculates the weighted sum of the encoder RNN output and uses it to generate a context vector. Given an input x1 , ..., xT , it stores all the encoded data
H = h1 , ..., hT . Here, dimension of H is m × n, where m is T and n is the
size of the RNN unit. The attention mechanism, which is a feed-forward neural
network, accepts the previous decoder hidden state ht and one of the cell state
vectors dt−1 as input, and outputs a relevant score et . The mechanism begins
with computing et ∈ e1 , ..., eT :
et = fatt (ht , dt−1 )

(8)

The attention score αt , where αt ∈ α1 , ....., αT , is calculated using the
softmax function:
exp(et )
sof tmax(αi ) = P
t exp(et ))

(9)

The context vector, Ct ∈ C1 , ....., CT , is the weighted sum of all the encoded
data, h1 , ...., hT :

Ct =

T
X
t

6

αt . ht

(10)

The computed Ct is used to predict the output. In the training process, Ct
is one of of the decoder input along with dt−1 and ŷt−1 and it outputs ŷt . In
testing process, the output from previous step, ŷt−1 , along with dt−1 and Ct ,
are used as the input.

3. Data Description
Data is collected from the COVID-19 database by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, which can be downloaded from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19. The archive
contains the total number of confirmed cases in the country, total deaths, and
patients diagnosed, including Canada, Italy, France, and Spain, in total cases
in 209 days.
3.1. Data analysis
Figure. 1 shows the probability density plot of all the four datasets. When
we plot cumulative cases values against their probabilities, we analyze it with a
random sample of a variable. By analyzing, we can determine the shape of the
probability distribution, the most likely value, the spread of values, and other
properties. It looks like a normal distribution. The spread of the cases is between
0 to 6 lacs. Mean, variance, kurtosis, and skewness of the distribution can be
calculated with the probability distribution of a random variable. Descriptive
statistics of the COVID-19 data of the considered countries between February
21, 2020, to September 12, 2020, are mentioned in Table 2.
As seen in Figure. 2, the outbreak of COVID-19 first started in Italy. Italy
reported its first COVID-19 case on January 31, 2020. In Italy, the total number
of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported during this period was 286295, with an
average of 2803 new cases per day. The highest number of cases, i.e., 91,153,
were reported in Lombardy, as north of Italy was affected the most by this
outbreak. Neighboring Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont recorded 29,029 and
28229 cases, respectively. In terms of the number of deaths due to spread, Italy

7

is the second largest in Europe. Spain reported the first case of COVID-19 one
month after Italy, and since then, the number of confirmed cases has risen to
about 650442. In France, another European country most affected, the first case
of COVID-19 was reported on January 24, 2020, the death toll reached 30910,
and the reported number confirmed 373911 cases.
Figure. 3 shows the total number of confirmed cases, recovered, and the
deaths cases in Italy. From the figure, it can be seen that confirmed cases,
recovered, and death cases are correlated with each other. Hence, total recovered
cases and deaths are considered as supportive features while implementing the
model.

4. Methodology
4.1. Fined Grained Attention Mechanism
The existing attention models use the single scalar score for a context vector
Ct at time t. It is observed that instead of using a single scalar of context vector
Ct , it might be better to calculate and use the scalar score for each dimension of
the hidden state ht at time t, as each dimension represents a different perspective
into the captured internal structure. In the encoder-decoder model computation,
Ct shares the same attention score resulted in an equal contribution of all the
dimensions of ht .
Choi et al. [37] shows that when the different dimensions of encoded information are considered differently, and attention is applied to each dimension, it
results in a better performing model.
Inspired by Choi et al. [37], we propose a fine-grained attention model.
In the proposed model, scalars are maintained for each dimension in H, which
results in an increase in the number of attention scalars from T to n × T .
Figure. 4 shows a comparison between the basic attention model and finegrained attention model.

In the proposed function, we extend the score function fAtt in equation 11
to return a set of scores corresponding to the dimensions of the hidden state
vector ht . That is,
n
ent = fatt
(ht , dt−1 )

(11)

where ent is the score assigned to the nth dimension of the tth context vector ht
n
and fatt
is a fully connected neural network where the number of output node is

that

4.2. Time2Vec
We used Time2Vec [38], a representation for the time which is invariant to
time rescaling. For a given scalar notion of time t , Time2Vec of t , denoted as
t2v(t), is a vector of size l + 1 defined as follows:

 α t + β , if j = 0
j
j
T ime2V ec(t)[j] =
G(α t + β ), if 1 ≤ j ≤ l.
j

(14)

where t2v(t)[i] is the ith element of t2v(t), G is a periodic activation function, and αj and βj are learnable parameters. Given the prevalence of vector
representations for different tasks, a vector representation for time makes it easily consumable by different architectures. We chose G to be the ReLu function
in our experiments.

The flow graph of the proposed methodology is shown in Figure. 5. We
divided each group into training, validation and testing. The number of samples
selected for training is preprocessed and scaled using a min-max scaler. Minmax scaler boosts the convergence rate of our training algorithm. The sample
values are scaled between the interval [−1, 1]. This also helps in preventing the
large magnitude samples from bringing large weights in training. In this paper,
The LSTM based fine-grained attention model is used because it performs well
for time series data. Faster convergence rate and ability to handle long-term
dependencies, making them an ideal choice for the forecasting community. The
model is trained on the data on a window (lookback) basis. Lookback is the
number of preceding time steps treated as input variables to predict the next
period. The predictions are made on a daily basis. We have used an exhaustive
search technique for hyper-parameters tuning. The model used has an input
shape of 7-time steps. Furthermore, the model has two LSTM layers, with the
output sequence of each layer treated as the input for the next layer. It consists
of 14 neurons in 1st , 7 neurons in 2nd layer. We have used Rectified Linear
Unit (ReLU) as the activation function for each layer. To avoid overfitting into
the network, we added Batch normalization layers and Dropout with value 0.20
after each layer. A single output layer is used, which is a dense layer without
an activation function. With a learning rate of 0.001 and a momentum value
of 0.90, Adam optimizer is used to train the model. We trained our model for
150 epochs, and a batch size of 1 for each dataset is used. We used the Pytorch
machine learning library [39] to implement our model. To assess the proposed
model’s performance, we have used two standard error metrics: mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) and Root mean square error (RMSE).

5. Results
This section compared the outputs generated by the proposed method with
some of the existing literature of COVID-19 outbreak prediction. The model
fitted the COVID-19 data reasonably well as shown in Table 3 with a minimum

12

RMSE of Italy = 689.84, RMSE of Spain = 919.27, RMSE of Canada = 36.20,
and RMSE of France = 711.69 values considering 14 steps of prediction. We
evaluate the model using test data and a different number of steps to predict
the out of sample forecast. The number of prediction steps considered is 2, 4,
6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. The proposed model achieved better performance than
other prediction models, though it is really unfortunate that transmissions are
following an increasing trend. In Italy and Spain, the infection rate is increasing
exponentially. The infections in Canada are also growing, though linearly, as
shown in Figure 2.
The accuracy of all the estimates is bounded by many external factors, which
puts us in a dilemma. Hence, we recommend performing further follow-up
studies about the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. The cases reported by the
Government might not be so accurate, as there is a huge backlog in getting
the test results, and also, few might get immune before getting tested. These
factors can also affect the accuracy of the estimation of the proposed model.
The other affecting factor might be travelers traveling between different regions.
Multiple trials are going on for the vaccine of COVID-19. If some of the trials
successfully invent the vaccine, it might also bring down our estimates. In Italy,
the number of patients infected since February 21 follows an exponential trend
until mid-May. The Government’s strict restrictions helped to decline the trend,
and the increase in the number of new cases was linear from mid-May to mid
of August. The Government then planned to return to normal life gradually.
However, it again increased the trend growth for new cases and turned into
exponential growth. Meanwhile, Spain, Europe’s second-worst-hit country with
29,813 deaths, has witnessed the lower death rate between May and August.
However, the death rate again started growing linearly since August. However,
the total number of confirmed cases in Spain and France has overtaken Italy.
France is currently at its peak in new confirmed cases daily. Although it also
observed a downward trend from May to July. The analysis shows that there
could be a second wave of infection. This analysis can help the healthcare
system to be better prepared for the pandemic.

6. Conclusions
The global pandemic of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has turned into
many countries’ primary national security issue. The development of good prediction models has become necessary to control this outbreak better and get
insights into the outbreak and consequences of the infectious disease. There
is a high level of uncertainty in the available data. Also, there is a lack in the
availability of important data. It has affected the accuracy of standard epidemiological models, which shows low accuracy for long-term prediction. This paper
presents a deep learning-based model using a fine-grained attention mechanism
and vector embedding. The proposed method has been evaluated with four publicly available COVID-19 datasets. The proposed method has been compared
with ARIMA and LSTM models used in literature with various step sizes. A
comparative analysis has been done to evaluate the proposed method’s performance using RMSE and MAPE error matrices. The results of the proposed
method reported a high generalized ability for long-term prediction. The paper
suggests that the proposed model can be an effective method to model current
outbreak data and predict long-term behavior.
