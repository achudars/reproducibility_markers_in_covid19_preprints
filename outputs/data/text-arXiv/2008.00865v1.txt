Abstract
This manuscript proposes a model of n distinct populations interaction
structured SEIR to describe the spread of COVID-19 pandemic diseases.
The proposed model has the flexibility to include geographically separated
communities as well as taking into account aging population groups and
their interactions. We show that distinct assumptions on the dynamics of
the proposed model lead to a plateau-like curve of the infected population,
reflecting collected data from large countries like Brazil. Such observations aim to the following conjecture: ” Covid-19 diseased diffusion from
the capitals to the Brazil interior, as reflected by the proposed model, is
responsible for plateau-like reported cases in the country”. We present
numerical simulations of some scenarios and comparison with reported
data from Brazil that corroborate with the aforementioned conclusions.

Introduction

The mathematical modeling of infectious disease has played an important role in
the definition of action protocols and public policies to combat diseases aiming
at the least social impact. It has been successfully used since the Bernoulli’s
pioneer work [1] on infectious diseases. An up-to-date example of the importance
of mathematical modeling on public policies for epidemic diseases is the recent
change in the UK’s strategies regards to the Covid-19 pandemic [2, 3]. An
extensive review of the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases can be
found in [4, 5, 6, 7] and references therein.

Covid-19 is by now known as a rapidly spread contagious diseases, with a first
registered outbreak at the end of December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and that
from there spread rapidly around the globe causing mortality without precedents
in the recent human history e.g [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and references therein.
Since up-to-day there is no safe vaccine or treatment, the remaining alternative
for the public policies to control the outbreak was the social mitigation, tacked
in some places to the extreme of severe lock-downs [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The
main goal of such a strategy was to ”flatness the infection curve” such that
the public health service could support the eventual high demand for ICU beds
[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].
Many countries have successfully implemented control strategies for the
Covid-19 pandemic outbreak employing massive testing and isolation allied with
social distance and population mitigation [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Such social
measures can be identified by the emergence of a plateau in the infected cases
reported on such countries [12, 15]. Its success can be measure due to the
relatively low mortality rate due to Covid-19 and an early secure economy reopening. Although, Brazil started with some kind of social distance measures
since the early stages of the epidemic (around the end of March, with the first
confirmed case on February 26, 2020), only recently the number of reported
daily mortality (daily new infected) seem to have attained a plateau that, by
the way, is in a high-level [16, 17]. Nevertheless, in some countries the public
authorities are pointing for a massive economy reopening, in contradiction of
the majority of the epidemiological specialist [18, 19].
With one eye on divulged official data, that reveal a plateau-like shape for
the reported cases from countries as Brazil [16, 17, 20], for which several mechanisms, like social distance, massive testing and isolation isolation, were never
effectively and seriously implemented, we shall questioning: ”Why can we observe a plateau even in an out of control epidemic outbreak?”.
In this context, the main objective of the present work is to analyze how a
plateau-like in the infected cases can arouse in an out of control epidemic outbreak and to analyze some scenarios for the Covid-19 epidemic in Brazil. Within
this purpose, we take into account the two main tools to study the spread of
this disease: a simple mathematical model and population interactions. Actually, we propose and analyze an structured SEIR-like compartmental epidemic
model. The SEIR model is a generalization of the well-known SIR compartmental model [4, 7] that includes the exposed fraction of the population, denote by
E. The literature on compartmental models and its applications in the COVID19 outbreak has grown as faster as the pandemic itself, making a complete literature overview almost impossible. Therefore, we shall mention publications
that are closely related to this manuscript. Age-structured SEIR models with
social mixing were analyzed in [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], where was analyzed the effectiveness of control measures aimed at reducing the social mixing population
in different countries as China, Italy, Uk, US, and Brazil. For a comprehensive
overview of related works, see [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and references therein.
In special, in [15] the authors propose to include dynamics for asymptomatic
and pre-symptomatic individuals in a modified SEIR model to explain the ex2

isting plateau in Covid-19 reported cases. However, such dynamics need to be
calibrated, and it is possible only if a massive testing program is considered.
Moreover, these approaches can not be applied to explain how a plateau-like
phenomenon arises in an out of control epidemic outbreak.
Main contributions: Our main contribution with this manuscript is to provide enough shreds of evidence that a structured SEIR model, where the structure is characterized by n distinct populations in interaction (see (1)), can predict a plateau-like shape for infected cases. The distinct populations can represent, for example, geographically separated communities, different groups (such
as the elderly or people with co-morbidity ), etc. As we shall see in the analysis
that follows (see Section 3), such plateau is a product of a diffusion-like effect
withing distinct populations. Although the derived analysis seems to be simple,
it is possible to simulate distinct scenarios, reflecting the Covid-19 infected data
ranging from countries where strict vertical isolation was implemented to scenarios with practically no population mitigation was adopted. In particular, we
conjecture that the Covid-19 diseased diffusion from the capitals to the Brazil
interior, reflected by the proposed model, is responsible for plateau-like reported
cases in the country.
The work is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the model.
We devote Section 3 to share some known facts about the proposed model as
well as to analyze the scenarios of the model that predicts a plateau-like shape
of reported cases. We also analyze what shall be the real-life scenario that
reflects such a situation. As we will see, the plateau-like shape can be associated
with the diffusion of the disease within populations (see Subsection 3.1. In
Subsection 3.2, we briefly discuss how the proposed model can be use to predict
the scenario for vertical an horizontal social isolation. In Section 4, we present
numerical simulations of a diversity of scenarios (see Subsection 4.1), for with
an extensive discussion is provided. Moreover, we also show how the proposed
model can describe reported Brazilian Covid-19 infected cases in Subsection 4.2.
In subsection 4.3, we show how vertical social isolation is illustrated by the
proposed model. Finally, Section 5 is dedicated to our conclusions.

The model

In the forthcoming analysis, we shall consider a variation of the well-known epidemiological SIR compartmental model proposed by Kermack and Mckendrick
[21]. Actually, our model is a generalization of the classical SEIR model [4, 7]
where we introduce the interaction of n distinct populations. Let Ni be the number of individuals in population i (i = 1, 2, ..., n), and NT = N1 + N2 + · · · + Nn
be the total integrated population. Let Si , Ei , Ii and Ri be the fractions, in
regard to Ni , of population i that are susceptible, exposed, infectiously and
recovery, respectively, at time t. In the model we consider, the time evolution

3

is given by the following dynamic system for i = 1, 2, ..., n:
Ṡi = −Si
Ėi = Si

βij Ij − (αi + µi )Ei

j=1

I˙i = αi Ei − (γi + µi )Ii
Ṙi = γi Ii − µi Ri ,
where βij are the disease transmission rate (proportional to the average contact
rate in the population and within the population), αi is the inverse of the
incubation period, γi is the inverse of the mean infectious period, for i = 1 · · · , n.
Furthermore, we assume that mortality rates µi is equal to the birth rates, such
that the total population Ni is constant during the diseases. Hence, we have
Si (t) + Ei (t) + Ii (t) + Ri (t) = 1.
Moreover, the dynamics (1) is considered with the following initial conditions
Si (0) = 1 − Ii (0), Ei (0) = 0, Ii (0), Ri (0) = 0 ,

(2)

where Ii (0) is the fraction of the population i infected at the time 0.

Some facts about the model

In this section, for easiness, we shall consider the model (1)-(2) with µi = 0.
Notice first that, from the third equation in (1), we get that the variation of
Ii (t) is proportional to the variation of Ei (t). In this setting, summing up the
second and the third equation in (1), we have the well-known SIR model, with
Iˆi (t) = Ii (t) + Ei (t). We consider that the properties we shall explore will be
well understood if some well-known facts about the model (1)-(2) are revisited.
We provide some details here for the sake of completeness. The model (1)-(2)
has a unique smooth solution, that depends continuously on the parameters
and the initial conditions, e.g. [22]. Then, whenever Si (0) and Iˆi (0) are strictly
positive, results in Si (t) and Iˆi (t) non negative, for all i = 1, · · · , n. It follows
from the first equation in (1) that Si (t) is decreasing. Moreover, adding the first
three equations in (1), we get the following conservation law
Si (t) + Iˆi (t) + γi

Z

Iˆi (s)ds = Si (0) + Iˆi (0) .

(3)

R∞
From (3), we get that Iˆi (t) < ∞, for all t ≥ 0. Furthermore, 0 Iˆi (t)dt ≤
∞. Since, Si (t) is decreasing, (3) also implies that Si∞ := lim Si (t) > 0.
t→∞
Consequently, (3) also imply that lim Iˆi (t) = 0. The basic reproduction number
t→∞

of the population i ,Ri0 , is the quantity that express the expected number of
4

cases directly generated by one case in a population and withing the selected
population, at the initial phase of the infection, is defined as βii Sγii (0) . It is wellknown that if Ri0 > 1, Iˆi (t) start increasing and then decreasing. Therefore,
given the smoothness of Iˆi (t) (as a result of the existence of a solution of (1))
and the above mentioned properties of Iˆi (t), we conclude that it trajectory has
a concave hump with extremes in Iˆi (0) and Iˆi (∞) = 0, see Figure 1. Hence,
Iˆi (t) attains a maximum at a point tip , known as the turning point. Adding the
˙
second and third equation in (1) and the fact that Iˆi (ti ) = 0, implies that

Si (tip ) =

Although simple, the analysis of the equation (4) revels several scenarios for
the dynamics, as pointed below:
1. Assuming that we have n isolated populations, i.e., βij = 0 for j 6= i, then
Si (tip ) =

γi
,
βii

as in the canonical SIR model. In this particular setting of no-cross contamination between different populations, we have tip = tjp and then, we
see the pick of the populations as one.
2. It is clear from (4) that Si (tip ) is lower and therefore Iˆi (tip ) is higher, den

appear in the quotient. It implies that the infection will be higher as higher
is the infected connection network. Consequently, any kind of population
isolation shall be tacked horizontally on the populations, in order of the
diseases spread mitigation be effective.

adding (3), we find out that the same behaviour discussed above is true
also for I(t). Indeed, its expected trajectory is a positive concave hump,

The emerging plateau-like infected curve: A consequence of diseases diffusion within distinct populations

A more interesting question that we would like to discuss in this approach is
the observed plateau-like phenomena as a consequence of the diseases diffusion.
Below, we shall argue how the proposed model (1) can be used to describe such
phenomena in the exposed/infected dynamics.
It started as follows: Assume that the diseases started at the population
i = 1, i.e., at time t = 0, we have Iˆ1 (0) > 0 and Iˆi (0) = 0, for i > 1. Hence,
the diseases will spread out throughout the population thanks to the population
interaction (see the first equation in (1)). Therefore, it would take some time
for the diseases spread out to the entirely population. It turns out that, for
n

βij ˆ i
any turning point ti , the quantity
Ij (t ) will present a sort of equilibrium

p

(as i changes) since for the population j, with j relatively far-way form i, the
infection is starting to growth and them Iˆj (tip ) have a relatively small value,
(for example, is we are looking for i close to 1 and j close to n), or then,
the opposite situation holds; the infected proportion of the population already
start declining, consequently Iˆj (tip ) is relatively small ( for example, is we are
looking for i close to n and j close to 1). As far as βij /βii remains proportion
throughout the population, the diffusion phenomena withing populations takes
Si (tip ) at the same level (see (4)) . As a consequence, the picks Iˆi (tip ) forms
a plateau-like effect observed in the infected/exposed compartment I. By the
way, this phenomena is observed for the COVID-19 real data on large territorial
counties as US and Brazil, see Figure 4.
Another consequence of the diffusion phenomena discussed above is that the
largest n is longer will take for the diseases starts to decline. Consequently, the
plateau-like phenomena is larges (see Figure 2). Moreover, it follows from (4)
that it takes higher levels as higher are the proportion of βij /βii , as expected
in largest populated cities or metropolitan regions.

3.2

Vertical and horizontal social isolation: How far we
can get into this discussion with the SEIR model (1)

Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and the lack of a treatment with efficacy evidences, the social isolation is the unique known measure for the pandemic controlling, e. g. [2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and references therein.
Some counties as UK and Sweden pointed or adopted a vertical social isolation
strategy (to protect only elderly or co-morbidity proportional of the population),
contrarily to the World Health Organization recommendation of a horizontal social isolation. Regardless of economical impacts of the adopted social isolation
strategy, in this section we discuss how far the proposed model (1) can share
light on the best strategy to be adopt to protect the population. It is worth
to mention that we do not intend to exhaust the discussion on the subject, but
only to make some comments on the subject based on the model (1).
6

At this point is reasonable to assume an age-structured population, where
i = 1 represents the proportion of elderly and co-morbidity population. Although the vertical isolation seem reasonable (it is equivalent to take β11 as
lower as possible, but of course, it is impossible assume it to be zero), since the
mortality for the COVID-19 are concentrated mostly in the elderly/co-morbidity
proportion of the population [23], it follows from (4) that β11 lower will get effect on the number of infected at the class i = 1, at least on it pick, might
be compensate for the interactions with the other ages-classes (βij 6= 0) on
the day-to-day life. The particular in-housing interaction between many aging
people are the reality of many families on lower incoming countries like Brazil
[23]. Notice that is sufficient that Iˆj (tip ), for one j 6= 1 with a high value to
take S1 (tip ) down (and consequently Iˆ1 (tip ) be large). See the scenario presented
in 4.3 for a numerical representation of such situation.
On the other hand, in a horizontal isolation scenario we have βij (consequently, Iˆj (t) for all t) closed to zero, for all i, j ∈ {1, · · · , n}. Hence, it follows
from (4) that quantity Si (tip ) is large resulting in Iˆi (tip ) relatively closed to Iˆi (0),
meaning that pressure on the health system might be kipped under control.

Numerical solutions

In this section we present numerical solutions for some particular cases of our
model (1). We consider, for simplicity, that all the n populations have the
same number N of individuals, namely, Ni = N = 1000000. We also consider
the simplest interaction case where each population interacts with only two
neighbour populations, namely, βij = β 6= 0 if j = i ± 1, βij = 0 for |j − i| > 1.
In this case we have a one dimensional chain of populations where |j − i| can
be used to define a distance from populations i and j. Furthermore, in order to
avoid asymmetries in the interactions of the first (i = 1) and the last (i = n)
populations, we also consider β1n = βn1 = β (this consideration implies that we
have a periodic uni-dimensional chain). Finally, we set βii = β, αi = α, γi = γ,
µi = µ = 0 (homogeneous populations). All numerical solution are obtained by
the traditional backward finite difference method with a time step of ∆t = 0.5
days.

4.1

Several distinct populations

We consider in this case α = 1/5 (we are supposing that the meantime before
an exposed individual becomes infectious is five days), γ = 1 (the meantime
before isolation for infectiously individuals is one day), β = 1.5 to result in a
severe epidemic outbreak, and µ = 0. For the interaction between neighboring
populations we consider β = 0.02, that is the contagious rate from individuals
outside the population is seventy-five times smaller than from individuals of the
same population. Initially, we consider that there is 200 infectious individual in
population i = 1 and zero in the other populations.

7

In Fig. 1 we show the role of interaction β in each population for n =
4. In Fig. 1 (a) we show the time evolution of exposed Ei and infected Ii
compartments. The exposed and infected compartments of population i = 1
reaches its maximum point first, followed by populations i = 2 and i = 4. The
last population to reach its epidemic peak is i = 3. These results are consistent
since the epidemic outbreak starts in population i = 1, propagating to the
first neighbouring populations i = 2 and i = 4, and finally achieving the most
distant population i = 3. The total exposed E = (E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 )/4 and
infected I = (I1 + I2 + I3 + I4 )/4 fractions in relation to the total population
NT = N1 + N2 + N3 + N4 is displayed in Fig.1 (b).

(b). For n = 1 we have the classical SEIR model [4, 7] with a sharp curve for
both exposed and infected fractions. For n = 4 (see Fig. 1 (b)), both curves
broaden but still there are not a plateau. By increasing the number of distinct
populations to n = 10 a well-defined plateau arouses. For n = 20 we can see that
the plateau extension increases with the growth of n. As a consequence of the
appearance of the plateau, we have an increase in the duration of the epidemic
outbreak, but with a smaller fraction of sick individuals in the population at
every moment. However, the accumulated fraction of sick people (I + R) at the
end of the outbreak varies little with n, as can be seen in Fig. 2 (b).
Finally, Fig. 3 displays the role of the intensity of interaction β for the epidemic outbreak dynamics. We consider two scenarios with n = 20. For β = 0.02
we have a strong interaction between distinct populations (a population is heavily contaminated by neighboring populations). As a consequence, we observe a
plateau that results from small-time distances between the epidemic peaks for
each individual population i. For a small interaction β = 0.001 (distinct populations are almost isolated) the time-distances between the epidemic maximum
points for each individual population i increases, resulting in an oscillatory behavior for exposed and infected fractions (instead of a plateau) and in a long

Comparing with real data from Brazil

It is important to stress that it is not the objective of the present work to
describes real data by using realistic values for the model parameters (as realistic values for populations Ni and parameters αi , βij , γi and µi ). The result
displayed here shows that our model has a great potential to describe real epidemic outbreak, but a detailed stud of real data will be done in a future work.
Our present objective is only to show that the model has the ingredients to
9

correctly describes the behavior of Covid-19 dynamics found in real data from
Brazil, including the appearance of a plateau phenomenon. With n = 200 and
Ni = N = 1000000 we found that our model describes very well the behavior of
Covid-19 epidemic outbreak when compared against real data from Brazil (see
Fig. 4). The real data displayed in Fig. 4 is from the ministry of health of Brazil
from February 26 up to July 28 of 2020 [20]. The model parameters are set to
α = 1/5, β = 1.5, β = 0.01 and γ = 1.004. Fig. 4 (a) shows the diary number
of infected individual, and Fig. 4 (b) displays the accumulated number of sick
people (I + R). The emergence of a plateau in the real data is characterized
by an almost constant mean value for new reported daily cases, which results
in an almost linear growth for the total accumulated cases. By looking at the
real data in Brazil, in Figures 4 (a) and (b), we can stipulate that the Covid-19
epidemic outbreak reaches a plateau in Brazil approximately four months after
the first reported case (at February 26). From these figures, we see a good concordance between real data and our model both in the emergence of a plateau
and in the general curve shape of the daily and total accumulated cases, respectively. This result indicates that the plateau of the Covid-19 epidemic outbreak
in Brazil may be a consequence of the disease’s geographic diffusion. This fact
motivates further research aiming at a more accurate description of the real
problem through a more realistic choice for our model’s parameters.

Vertical social isolation

Finally, in addition to populations in different geographic regions, our model
(1) can also be used to describes different partitions of a population in the same
geographic location. We consider as an example the problem of vertical social
isolation. In this case, a number of N1 individuals in risk groups (such as the
elderly or people with co-morbidity) are isolated, while the rest N2 individuals
of the population are not confined. Let us assume that isolated individuals are
confined alone. In this case, we should have β11 = 0 since isolated persons do
not have contact with other isolated individuals. The disease contagion follows
from contact with non-confined persons. Let also we set β22 = 1.5 for the
disease transmission rate of non-isolated individuals (proportional to the average
10

contact rate in the i = 2 population). By supposing a hypothetically simple case
where non-confined persons go out from home five times a week, while isolated
individuals go out only one time a week, we can set β12 = β21 = β22 /5 = 0.3.

one. We show the exposed and infected fractions for isolated and non-confined
individual in Fig. 5 (a). As expected, the epidemic outbreak is more severe
for non-confined individuals. However we despite the small disease transmission
rate β12 = β21 , the total fraction of isolated persons that becomes sick is not
negligible as can be seen in the accumulated number of sick people (Ii + Ri ) in
Fig. 5 (b).

Conclusions and future directions

The proposed model of n distinct populations interaction structured SEIR (1)
stands as one alternative to describe the spread of COVID-19 pandemic diseases. The proposed model has the flexibility to include geographically separated communities as well as taking into account aging population groups and
their interactions. Furthermore, we have shown how some strategies of nonpharmacological intervention as vertical and horizontal social isolation can be
discussed using the proposed model. Analyzing some possible scenarios reflected
by the proposed model, we show how a plateau-like curve of infected is a result
of a disease’s diffusion effect within distinct populations, resembling collected
data from large countries as Brazil (see Figure 4). In particular, we conjecture
that the Covid-19 diseased diffusion from the capitals to the Brazil interior, as
reflected by the proposed model, is responsible for plateau-like reported cases
in the country. Collaborating with the analysis, we also present in Section 4
numerical solutions for some scenarios of the model (1) showing its applicability,
in particular for describing the plateau-like shape of reported infected cases in
Brazil.

Future directions: Many open questions in regard to the proposed model (1)
remains, and shall be explored in the future. Between them, we pointed out the
following:
• Investigate more realistic geometries, where a population interacts with
more than two neighbors.
• Include more partition in the model, as for example dead and quarantine
fractions.
• Explore the complexity of the population interplay network more carefully,
including age and distinct population interaction.
• Analyze bifurcations and its consequences.
• Study optimal strategies for vaccination associated with the interacted
population dynamics (1).
