Abstract: Since the first reports of a coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, Hubei province, China,
scientists are working around the clock to find sound answers to the issue of its origin. While the
number of scientific articles on SARS-CoV-2 is increasing, there are still many gaps as to its
origin. All studies failed to find a coronavirus in other animals that is more similar to human
SARS-COV-2 than the bat virus, considered to be the primary reservoir. In this paper we address
a new hypothesis, based on a possible recombination between a DNA and SARS-CoV viruses, to
explain the rise of SARS-CoV-2. By comparing SARS-CoV-2 and related CoVs with
circoviruses (CVs), we found strong sequence similarity of the genomic region at the 3’-end of
Bat-CoV ORF1a and the origin of replication (Ori) of porcine CV type 2 (PCV2), as well as
similar RNA secondary structures of the region encompassing the cleavage site of CoV S gene

1

with the PCV2 Ori. This constitutes a primary evidence that supports a possible recombination,
which occurrence might explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; Evolution; Circovirus
1. Introduction
Many theories about the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 have been proposed; the most debated ones
have been: its natural emergence after passing from bats to an intermediate animal, which served
as a springboard for SARS-CoV-2 to jump from bats to humans (1), and the virus being
deliberately engineered and accidentally released by humans (2). The hypothesis of natural
emergence is far more supported by recent data and two scenarios have been suggested (3); the
first is natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer which necessitates an animal
intermediate that have a high population density (to allow natural selection) and an ACE2encoding gene similar to the human ortholog, since the SARS-CoV-2 virus have acquired both
the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the Spike protein suitable for human ACE2 binding.
The second scenario is natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer, where the
progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 jumped into humans and acquired new genomic features through
adaptation during undetected human to human transmission.
It is now recognized that the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein gained
specific features that facilitated its spread as compared to its closely related Bat-CoV RaTG13
strain, as supported by both phylogenetic analysis (4) and a single nsp8 gene, typical of BatCoVs (5,6). The most remarkable event in SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is the insertion of a
cleavage site (residues PRRA) at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits, compared to BatCoV RaTG13 strain (Gisaid ID: EPI_ISL_402131). The severity of infection has not been yet
fully linked to the newly acquired furin-like cleavage site, however has likely facilitated the host
species jump and a dramatic increase in cell-cell fusion capacities. Such events were previously
reported for Sendai virus following the insertion of a second furin cleavage site in the F protein
(7).
Additionally, the insertion of a furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is
reminiscent of a low-pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV) (8,9), which, when introduced into
a poultry farm, acquired a polybasic cleavage motif that caused a deadly outbreak of highly
pathogenic virus. However, several questions are still unanswered concerning the reason why the
acquisition of the cleavage site is restricted to a particular genome region, as reported previously
2

for AIV (10) and whether SARS-CoV-2 is a ”Chimera” of two viral strains or if it resulted from
the accumulation of point mutations, as hypothesized in most published studies (1). CoVs are
characterized by the reduced error rate of their viral polymerases, much lower than that of other
RNA viruses (11,12), unless they recombine their genomes with a related CoV. This feature, that
has been observed for SARS-CoV-2 infection (as estimated from public genome sequences
released since December 2019), might ultimately limit the mutagenic variability of the virus over
a short period of time. Therefore, recombination might prove to be a prominent driving factor in
the evolution and the expansion of species range and cellular tropism.
Recent studies reported the detection of a Bat-CoV RmYN02 strain (Gisaid ID:
EPI_ISL_412977) containing insertions in the S1/S2 cleavage site (13) and the detection of two
human SARS-CoV-2 variants (SARS-CoV-2 Variants 1 and 2) (14) showing deletion mutations
in the furin-like cleavage site and its flanking sites. More recent study reported three human
variants (referred here as SARS-CoV-2_mut1, SARS-CoV-2_mut2, and SARS-CoV-2_mut3)
showing deletions at the S1/S2 junction (15). The detection of the human variants, in vivo and/or
in vitro, suggests that this region of the S gene is under strong selective pressure, given that
replication in permissive cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function.
Given the importance of this region, we decided to further analyze a possible origin of the furinlike cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 S gene.
The most important question is whether these insertions/deletions are due to homologous
recombination or might have resulted from a recombination between two different viruses.
Here, we consider the hypothesis of a possible recombination between RNA and DNA viruses to
explain the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Although the recombination between RNA and DNA
viruses was considered, for a long time, as an unusual and extremely rare event, it was
previously described by the isolation of a circovirus-like genome, called Boiling Springs Lake
RNA-DNA hybrid virus (BSL-RDHV) from an acidic hot lake (16,17). It was reported that the
gene for the rolling-circle replication initiation protein (RC-Rep) of BSL-RDHV is inherited
from a circovirus-like ancestor whereas the capsid protein (Cap) gene is most closely related to
that of ssRNA viruses (16). Additionally, a metagenomic study tracing the prevalence of circular
DNA viruses in tissue specimens and environment samples, followed by sequence annotation
using bioinformatics tools, reported recombination events, never described before, between
ssDNA viruses and ssRNA viruses (18).

2.1. Genetic data and sequence alignment
Publicly

available

genomic

CoVs

sequences

were

obtained

from

GenBank

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) (as by 08/09/2020). We
used basic local alignment search tool BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information
[NCBI], Bethesda, United States) (19). The use of local alignment is justified by the fact that the
CVs and CoVs are too divergent to retain discernable sequence similarity using global alignment
algorithms. Nucleotide BLAST was used with appropriate parameters (Word size: 7; Gap
Existance:4, Gap Extension: 2). Data mining was carried out using local database comprising a
metagenomic data of DNA viruses in animal specimens and environmental samples, reported
previously (18). To evaluate the sequence variability, genome sequences were aligned using
ClustalW (20) and MAFFT (21) and refined manually. Alignments for region flanking the
cleavage site of the S glycoprotein and the PCV2 Ori were extracted from the genome alignment.
2.2. Secondary structure prediction
The

centroid

secondary

structures

(SS)

were

first

generated

by

RNAfold

(http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/) using default parameters (22), then visualized and edited using
VARNA v.3-93 (23). In order to show SS variability, the missing sequence motifs in viral strains
(RaTG13 and Pangolin CoVs) were completed by their corresponding sequences in SARS-CoV2.
3. Results
3.1. Sequence homology and secondary structure analyses
We selected, as a query for sequence homology search (using nucleotide BLAST), a mosaic
region comprising the insertion region of the recently detected Bat-CoV RmYN02 strain (Gisaid
ID: EPI_ISL_412977) and its missing upstream and downstream nucleotide sequences from
SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain (Genbank accession n o NC_045512) (Fig. 1). The similarity search
was carried out against circoviruses (taxid:39725) with appropriate alignment parameters (see
material and methods). Three similar 11-nt sequences were shown in the genomes of PCV2
(Genbank accession no MF326358 and MK377563) and Beak and feather disease virus (Genbank
accession no MN175611) (Fig. 1). The first two similar regions of PCV2 correspond to the
4

junction region between Cap and replication initiator protein (Rep) genes, known to be the DNA
origin of replication (Ori) of PCV2 (24), while the third one corresponds to a reverse
complement region in the Cap gene of Beak and feather disease virus. The main structural
feature of the Ori is its stem-loop secondary structure (SS). Based on this result, we carried out
the alignment of the region flanking the furin-like cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1,
and their related strains.
Variants 1 and 2 of SARS-CoV-2 (from the original article) (14), human SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan
strain (Genbank accession no NC_045512; position from 23554 to 23639), the three SARS-CoV2 mutants described above (SARS-CoV-2_mut1, SARS-CoV-2_mut2, and SARS-CoV-2_mut3;
from the original article), Bat-CoV RaTG13 strain (Genbank accession n o MN996532; position
from 23536 to 23609), two Human SARS-CoV-1 (Genbank accession n o DQ182595; position
from 23425 to 23494; Genbank accession no DQ640652; position from 23447 to 23516 ), BatCoV RmYN02 strain (Gisaid ID: EPI_ISL_412977; position from 23415 to 23482), PangolinCoV isolate MP789 (Genbank accession no MT121216; position from 23400 to 23473),
Bat_CoV isolate Rs4874 (Genbank accession no KY417150; position from 23442 to 23511), and
Civet related CoV-1 (Genbank accession no AY572034; position from 23415 to 23484 ) were
used in the present study to generate a multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, data
mining of unclassified CVs isolates showed similarity of a unexpected Rep 3’-5’ sequence
region of a Raccoon CV (isolate ctcc28) with both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S genes; it
was then added to the sequence alignment (Genbank accession no MK012475; position from
1690 to 1763).
The results showed a high variability, mainly in the downstream region of the alignment (Fig.
2A). The used Raccoon CV showed sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-1 and its related strains
(yellow boxes), mapping mostly to the beginning of the alignment and to a region specific of
SARS-CoV-1 strains. However, the highest sequence similarity of Raccoon CV was shown with
SARS-CoV-2 and its related strains, mainly in the high variable region (blue boxes).
To assess whether S gene of CoVs shows similar SS structure as that of CV, we carried out the
SS analysis of the RNA region flanking the cleavage site of different CoVs (Human SARS-CoV2 Wuhan strain, Bat-CoV RaTG13 strain, and Pangolin-CoV isolate MP789) and compared them
with the well-known SS of the PCVs Ori (24,25) (Fig. 3).

5

The results showed five similar nucleotides at the loop structure (5’-gUAUA-3’) and four similar
nucleotides (5’-gCgC-3’) in the stem of PCV2 and SARS-CoV-2 SS palindrome (Fig. 3). While
these nucleotides are totally or partially shared by Bat-CoV RaTG13 strain and Pangolin-CoV
isolate MP789, they were different in Bat-CoV RmYN02 strain and SARS-CoV-1 (data not
shown). However, nucleotide substitutions at specific positions downstream the the cleavage site
of Bat-CoV RmYN02 allow the generation of similar SS with SARS-CoV-2 (data not shown),
suggesting that nucleotide mutations at the stem loop structure of CoVs might hamper the
formation of similar SS as PCV2.
As reported previously, the SS of PCV2 Ori showed four hexa-nucleotide sequences (H1-4) and
two penta-nucleotide sequences (P1 and P2) (25), whereas we report here that SARS-CoV-2
showed three H (H1-3) and one P; both viruses shared the H3 and partially P1, generating the
furin-like cleavage site. The Bat-CoV RatG13 strain and Pangolin-CoV isolate MP789 shared
two H (H1 and H2) with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3).
According to these SS structures, the Bat-CoV RaTG13 strain is more closely related to SARSCoV-2. The difference was an insertion of P and H3 sequences, identical to P1 and H3 of PCV2,
generating a cleavage site (Fig. 3).
3.2. Sequence homology analysis of bat-CoV and PCV2 Ori
Besides the SS homology between CoVs and PCV2, these findings suggest that Bat-CoV/PCV2
recombination occurs only when both viruses have identical nucleotide sequences at the region
flanking the cleavage site of CoVs and the PCV2 Ori. Thus, the region encompassing H1, H2,
P1, and H3 (5’-CggCAGCggCAgCACCTCggCgg-3’) of the PCV2 Ori was used as query for
similarity search among CoV strains (Fig. 2B). The results showed sequence similarity with the
3’-end of ORF1a of three recently published Bat-CoV strains: BtRt-BetaCoV_1 (Genbank
accession no MT337387; position from 12052 to 12127), BtRt-BetaCoV_2 (Genbank accession
no MT337386; position from 12046 to 12121), and BtRt-BetaCoV_3 (Genbank accession n o
MT337385; position from 11963

to 12038), compared to other SARS-CoVs (Fig. 2B).

Surprisingly, these sequences are mapped to the 3’-end of ORF1a of these Bat-CoVs, while we
expected them in the S gene, as a motif in the query sequence unique to the cleavage site of
SARS-CoV-2 S gene (5’-CggCgg-3’) is shared by PCV2 Ori.

6

During DNA replication of PCV2, the viral Rep protein of PCV2 nicks an octa-nucleotide
sequence (5’-AgTATT†AC-3’) of the Ori (loop structure) between T6 and A7 to generate a free
3′-OH end for initiation of plus-strand DNA replication (24). Interestingly, these Bat-CV strains
have a similar nucleotide sequence, mainly at the nick site (5’-AgTAgTT†AC-3’) (Fig. 2B). The
SS prediction of the region of CoVs ORF1a did not show similar structures with PCV2 Ori (data
not shown), otherwise we could postulate a recombination event between the two viruses driven
by template switching of the polymerase during the virus replication, given the high variability
among CoV strains at the downstream of stem-loop structure. More sampling within bat CoV
population may help to better characterize the sequence similarity shown in the present study.
These results, taken altogether, suggest that two separate events might have occurred. While the
first analysis showed sequence similarity between the 3’-end of ORF1a of several Bat-CoVs and
PCV2 Ori, the second showed sequence similarity between a unclassified Rep CV sequence from
the skin of Raccoon and SARS-CoVs as well as SS match of the region encompassing the
cleavage site of a Bat-CoV RaTG13, Pangolin CoV, and Human SARS-CoV-2 strains with
PCV2 Ori. Interestingly, the furin-like cleavage site (5’-CCTCggCgg-3’) was shared between
PCV2 Ori and Raccoon CV Rep gene. Although the transmission of PCVs to Raccoon
population is recently reported (26), the exact mechanism(s) underlying the genetic
rearrangement within CV genomes is still unknown.
These in silico findings are far to be a definitive answer on the SARS-CoV-2 origin but we think
they can be a key piece in the Wuhan puzzle. In fact, our assumption postulates that CVs
(Porcine and/or Raccoon) likely played, in the course of evolution, a role as an intermediate
between Bat/Pangolin CoVs due to sequence similarity and SS match with the region of the 3’end of ORF1a and the region flanking the cleavage site of the S gene, respectively. The genetic
rearrangement and recombination may enhance the acquisition of the cleavage site in the S gene,
resulting in a rapid evolution of the virus in Bats and its jump into humans (Fig. 4).
4. Discussion
Some events in the past few years about viral infections among animals in China need to be
highlighted, supporting a bat-swine transmission of CoV infection in China.
In 2017, it was reported that SARS-Like-CoVs in bats were discovered in a cave in Yunnan
province, China, while tracing the SARS-CoV pandemic in 2003 (SARS-CoV-2003). The
7

researchers declare that these viruses used the ACE2 receptor to infect cells and could replicate
efficiently in primary human airway cells (27). This study revealed that some of these SARSLike-CoVs circulating in this cave are highly diverse in the S gene whereas other strains with
high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-2003 in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit. However, this study did not report the
insertion of a furin cleavage site within the sequenced genomes of the new detected SARS-LikeCoVs, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 strain did not originate directly from those isolates.
In the same year (2017), another new bat-HKU2-like porcine CoVs, named porcine enteric
alphacoronavirus (PEAV), was isolated from suckling piglets in Guangdong, China (28-30). The
full genome sequence of PEAV GDS04 strain shared high nucleotide identities (≈95%) with the
reported bat-HKU2 strains (EF203064). One year later, another novel swine acute diarrhea
syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV-2018) was reported in Fujian, China (31). This virus was
shown to be genetically related to previously detected PEAV GDS04 and bat-CoV-HKU2 strains
with 99.6% nt and 98.9% nt identity, respectively. Furthermore, the evolutionary analysis
showed that SADS-CoV-2018 was more similar to bat-origin SADS-related CoVs (SADSrCoVs)(32) than to those of swine-origin SADS-CoVs, suggesting that SADS-CoV-2018 might
have originated from bats.
The diversity and prevalence of environmental RNA and DNA viruses as epicenters of
uncommon recombination events are still very poorly studied (33). Although the DNA/RNA
recombination was not shown previously between PCV2 and Bat-CoV, heterologous inter-family
recombination event was reported between Bat-CoV and bat orthoreovirus (34).
The sequence similarity and SS match could constitute another mechanism by which the
recombination events occur between these two unrelated viruses. While the SS of CVs Ori was
discussed in the present study as the main structure for the initiation of virus replication, these
structures regulate many stages of the viral replication cycle of RNA viruses, including genome
replication and packaging, intracellular trafficking (35), and play a potential role in genetic
recombination (36-39).
The high variability and rearrangement of the region downstream the stem-loop SS were
reported previously for PCV1 (40), closely related to PCV2, to yield deletion and/or extensive
nucleotide reorganization of the hexa-nucleotide sequences. In particular, mutations engineered
into H1/H2 of nonpathogenic PCV1 were invariably deleted so that the downstream H3/H4 was
8

placed next to the palindrome (40). According to this same study, viral genomes with mutations
engineered into both H1/H2 and H3/H4 underwent extensive nucleotide reorganization to yield
progeny viruses containing either H3/H4, h-like/H4, or h-like/H3/H4 sequences, generating
sequences in a similar way as the downstream region of SS of Bat-CoV RmYN02 and SARSCoV-1 strains (data not shown).
DNA replication of CVs is initiated by cleaving the loop structure at a specific nick site using the
synthesized viral Rep protein (41). Therefore, we suggest that the deletions in the cleavage site in
recently detected SARS-CoV-2 variants, even though they showed similar SS, are a result of a
selective pressure on the adaptive sequence rather than specific point mutations or homologous
recombination, in a similar way as for CVs.
Finally, it is worth noting that the sequence mapped to the PCV2 Ori was reported to have a CpG
oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) (42) and therefore similar CoV sequence mapping to that position
could modulate the immune response. This needs further experimental investigation.
4. Conclusion
The RNA viruses as new potential candidate agents for the global pandemics were extensively
discussed (43). However, due to their high genetic variability, inter- and intra-species
recombination strategies increasing the already huge diversity, it is impossible to anticipate the
emergence of a new viral strain.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 could be seen as an

opportunity to elucidate some uncommon RNA/DNA recombination events. We report in the
present study a new perspective concerning the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 by focusing on the
cleavage site of the S gene and similar events that might have occurred in the genome of SARSCoV-2. This suggests the importance of monitoring SARS-like CoVs in Bats and CVs in animal
herds as well as the establishment of effective strategies to hamper interspecies spread of these
two viruses.

Figure. 1. Schematic diagram of the two steps used to compare the query sequence. The first
step was carried out using mosaic region as query for SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV RmYN02
strain against the available circovirus strains. The used sequences were shown by dashed and line
rectangles and the stem-loop sequence was underlined. The start codon for PCV2 Rep gene was
shown by blue box. The second step was carried out using the PCV2 Ori region against the
available coronavirus strains.

Figure. 2. Schematic representation of the sequence alignments. (A) The alignment of the region
of the S gene cleavage site and its flanking region of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and their
related strains. The Raccoon CV Rep sequence is highlighted by a black box. The identical
nucleotide positions of Raccoon CV with SARS-CoV-1 and its related strains are shown by
yellow boxes whereas blue boxes highlighted the identical nucleotide positions with SARS-CoV2 and its related strains. The 2 dots 3 dashes black box is used to highlight the variable region of
the sequence alignment. The one-letter amino acids of the acquired cleavage site are shown by
horizontal lines. (B) The alignment of the PCV2 Ori with 3’-end ORF1a of CoVs. Identical
nucleotide positions between PCV2 Ori and Bat-CoVs are shown by black boxes. The 2 dots 3
dashes red box is used to highlight the variable region of the sequence alignment. The stem-loop,
hexanucleotide (H), and pentanucleotide (P) sequences are shown by panels underneath the
figure. The nick site is indicated by an arrow.

Figure 3. Secondary structure comparison of different virus strains generated by RNAfold and
edited by VARNA v.3-93. Similar nucleotides in the stem-loop between PCV2 and CoVs
(human, bat, and pangolin) are shown by yellow and grey, respectively. The hexanucleotides (H)
and pentanucleotides (P) are shown by different colors. The variable region in the alignments
(Fig.2) is highlighted by ultrafine dashed boxes. The one-letter amino acids of the cleavage site
are shown for SARS-CoV-2.

Figure 4. Genome organization of PCV2 and Bat-CoV (Genbank accession no NC_048212).
The sequences of the PCV2 Ori and regions of the S glycoprotein encompassing the cleavage
site as well as region showing sequence similarity with PCV2 Ori are illustrated with dashed
lines. Numbers in arrows indicate the suggested steps for genetic recombination between BatCoV and animal CVs. The remarkable insert in the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is indicated by
a blue box and a question mark. The bat, swine, raccoon, and human are used to show the host
species involved in the present study.
