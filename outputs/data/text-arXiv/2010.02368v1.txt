Abstract
We propose a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a homogeneously mixing non constant population, and generalize it to a model where the parameters are
given by piecewise constant functions. This allows us to model the human behavior and the impact of public health policies on the dynamics of the curve of active infected individuals during
a COVID-19 epidemic outbreak. After proving the existence and global asymptotic stability of
the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points of the model with constant parameters, we consider a family of Cauchy problems, with piecewise constant parameters, and prove the existence
of pseudo-oscillations between a neighborhood of the disease-free equilibrium and a neighborhood
of the endemic equilibrium, in a biologically feasible region. In the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, this pseudo-periodic solutions are related to the emergence of epidemic waves. Then,
to capture the impact of mobility in the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics, we propose a complex
network with six distinct regions based on COVID-19 real data from Portugal. We perform numerical simulations for the complex network model, where the objective is to determine a topology
that minimizes the level of active infected individuals and the existence of topologies that are likely
to worsen the level of infection. We claim that this methodology is a tool with enormous potential
in the current pandemic context, and can be applied in the management of outbreaks (in regional
terms) but also to manage the opening/closing of borders.

numbers are relatively lower. In these cases, there is also a repetition of these oscillations that
are called pandemic waves. A second wave of the pandemic poses an imminent threat to society,
with an immense cost in terms of human lives and a devastating economic impact, it is therefore,
crucial to try to avoid the emergence of pandemic waves.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization announced
the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [19]. At the time of writing, several
countries across Europe are seeing a resurgence in COVID-19 cases after successfully controlling the
first outbreak and started to take action to face the so-called second wave [10]. Mathematical tools
have been important in the analysis and control of COVID-19 pandemic, see e.g. [15, 22, 18, 17]
and references cited therein.
In this paper, we propose a mathematical model given by a system of ordinary equations based
on the model from [23], for the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a homogeneously mixing
population, and we generalize it to a non constant population model with piecewise constant parameters. Considering parameters determined by piecewise constant functions allows to model the
governmental and public health decisions of political actors, which have a large influence on the
behaviors of individuals, which in turn can change the dynamics of the epidemic, see e.g. [1, 4, 9].
Moreover, the piecewise constant parameters also allows to mathematical model the human behavior in the application of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as, physical distancing,
limited size of indoor and outdoor gatherings, teleworking, regular cleaning of frequently-touched
surfaces and appropriate ventilation of indoor spaces, mask use, avoiding close contact and hand
washing, see e.g. [11, 12].
Viruses need cells to replicate themselves, as they are not able to do so on their own. Depending
on the type of virus, contagion is more or less facilitated depending on the means of transmission.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, the transmission is carried out through droplets containing viruses
that are sent from the respiratory tract. Accordingly, as the airways are the gateway to the virus,
the proximity of people and the dynamics imposed by the movement are a determining factor in
the spread of the COVID-19 disease. The proof that the movement of people is a determining
factor for contagion is that during the recent periods of confinement the number of infections has
decreased very markedly [26].
In this paper, the COVID-19 mathematical model is improved by constructing a complex
network of dynamical systems, following the framework presented in [6, 7], in order to take into
account the mobilities of individuals, which are also known to play a decisive role in the dynamics
of the epidemic. We investigate in which cases such a COVID-19 second wave can occur, by
establishing sufficient conditions for pseudo-periodic solutions: see, e.g., [8, 27, 14] for traveling
waves results in epidemiological models and [3, 5, 13] for complex network models.
Our model is calibrated in order to fit with the real data of the COVID-19 dynamics in six
regions of Portugal mainland, namely Norte, Centro, Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, Alentejo, Algarve and
Pinhal Litoral.
Numerical simulations are provided where we explore the effect of the topology of the network
on the dynamics of the epidemics (disposal of connections and coupling strength). We identify
which type of topology minimizes the level of infection of the epidemic, and which type of topology
worsens the number of infected individuals.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we propose a mathematical model for the
transmission dynamics of SARS-COV-2, with constant parameters and variable population size.
We show that the model admits two equilibrium points and analyze their local and global stability.
In Section 3, we consider piecewise constant parameters, which allows to model the impact of public
health policies and the human behavior in the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. The existence
and uniqueness of global solutions of the model with piecewise constant parameters is proved. An
important result in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of epidemic waves,
is proved in Section 4, where a sufficient condition is proved to the existence of pseudo-periodic
solutions. In Section 5, we construct a complex network of SAIRP models with piecewise constant
parameters, where each node represent one of six regions in Portugal, and where the values of the
parametes differ from one region to another. The case study, with COVID-19 real data from
2

Portugal, is analyzed in Section 6, where we calibrate the model to each of the six regions and
after, numerical simulations are performed in order to determine the topologies that minimizes
the average number of active infected individuals in Portugal. The results obtained in this paper
are discussed, in Section 7, from a practical point of view and its implications in the management
of the COVID-19 pandemic waves. We end the paper in Section 8, with some conclusions and
future work.
2. Model with constant parameters
We propose a compartmental SAIRP mathematical model, based on [23], where the population
is subdivided into five classes: susceptible individuals (S); asymptomatic infected individuals (A);
active infected individuals (I); removed (including recovered and COVID-19 induced deaths) (R);
protected individuals (P ). The total population, N (t) = S(t) + A(t) + I(t) + R(t) + P (t), with
t ∈ [0, T ] representing the time (in days) and T > 0, has a variable size where the recruitment rate,
Λ, and the natural death rate, µ > 0, are assumed to be constant. The susceptible individuals
S become infected by contact with active infected I and asymptomatic infected A individuals, at
, where θ represents a modification parameter for the infectiousness of
a rate of infection β (θA+I)
N
the asymptomatic infected individuals A. The remaining assumptions follows the one from [23]:
only a fraction q of asymptomatic infected individuals A develop symptoms and are detected, at
a rate v. Active infected individuals I are transferred to the recovered/removed individuals R,
at a rate δ, by recovery from the disease or by COVID-19 induced death. A fraction p, with
0 < p < 1, is protected (not immune) from infection, by the application of non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPI), such as, physical distancing, limited size of indoor and outdoor gatherings,
teleworking, regular cleaning of frequently-touched surfaces and appropriate ventilation of indoor
spaces, mask use and hand washing, see e.g. [11, 12], that prevent from being exposed to the
infection, and is transferred to the class of protected individuals P , at a rate φ. A fraction m of
protected individuals P returns to the susceptible class S, at a rate w. In what follows, for the
sake of simplification, we use the notation ν = vq and ω = wm. The previous assumptions are
described by the following system:

The following theorem establishes the existence of global solutions to (2).
Theorem 1. For any x0 = (S0 , A0 , I0 , R0 , P0 )T ∈ Ω, the Cauchy problem given by (2) and
x(0) = x0 admits a unique solution, denoted by x(t, x0 ), defined on [0, ∞), whose components are
non-negative. Furthermore, the region Ω defined by (4) is positively invariant.
Proof. The existence of a local in time solution x(t, x0 ) to problem (2) starting from x0 ∈ Ω
follows from the theory of ordinary equations (see, for instance, [20]). The non-negativity of the
components is guaranteed by the quasi-positivity of the non-linear operator f = (fj )1≤j≤5 , which
means that it satisfies the property
fi (x1 , . . . , xi−1 , 0, xi+1 , . . . , x5 , α) ≥ 0,
for all x = (x1 , . . . , x5 ) ∈ (R+ )5 , i ∈ {1, . . . , 5} and α ∈ R9 . By virtue of Proposition A.17
in [24], it follows that the components of any solution x(t, x0 ) stemming from x0 in Ω remain
non-negative in future time. Finally, summing the five equations of system (2) leads to
Ṅ (t) + µN (t) ≤ Λ,

t > 0,

from which it is deduced, using Gronwall’s lemma, that

The latter inequality proves that the region Ω defined by (4) is positively invariant.
2.2. Equilibrium points and basic reproduction number
In this section, we study the equilibrium points of system (1) and derive their expressions with
respect to the parameters of the model. We compute the basic reproduction number, denoted by
R0 , following the approach in [25].
Proposition 1. The model (1) has two equilibrium points:
• disease-free equilibrium, denoted by Σ0 , given by

Σ0 = (S0 , A0 , I0 , R0 , P0 ) =

Proof. The computation of the equilibrium points and the basic reproduction number follows
standard arguments, see [25].
2.3. Local and global stability analysis
In what follows we prove the local and global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium
(DFE), when the basic reproduction number satisfies the inequality R0 < 1. For R0 > 1, we prove
that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable in a biologically meaningful compact
positive invariant region.
Theorem 2 (local stability of the DFE). The disease-free equilibrium, Σ0 , is locally asymptotically
stable whenever R0 < 1.
Proof. The Jacobian matrix of system (1), evaluated at the disease-free equilibrium (5), is given
by

The eigenvalues of the matrix M (Σ0 ) are given by λ1 = λ2 = −µ, λ3 = −(φp + µ + ω) and the
remaining two, λ4 and λ5 , are the roots of the polynomial p(λ) given by
p(λ) = λ2 + Bλ + C,

+ δ + 2µ + ν and C = pφ+µ+ω
. Applying the Routh–Hurwitz criterion,
where B = −βθ(1−p)(ω+µ)
(pφ+µ+ω)
we conclude that model (1) is locally stable if, and only if, A > 0 and B > 0. It is easy to show
that C > 0 whenever R0 < 1. The coefficient B is positive when

βθ(1 − p)(ω + µ) < (δ + 2µ + ν)(pφ + µ + ω) .
Since all parameters take positive values, we have
βθ(1 − p)(ω + µ) < β (1 − p) (δ θ + µ θ + ν) (ω + µ) .

In other words,
(δ + µ)(µ + ν) < δ + 2µ + ν .
Therefore,
(δ + µ) (ν + µ) (pφ + µ + ω) < (δ + 2µ + ν) (pφ + µ + ω) ,
which ensures that B > 0. It follows the local asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium
Σ0 .
Theorem 3 (global stability of the DFE). If R0 < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium, Σ0 , is
globally asymptotically stable in Ω.
Proof. Since R0 < 1, we can write R0 = 1 − η with 0 < η < 1. We obtain that
β (1 − p) (δ θ + µ θ + ν) (ω + µ)
= 1 − η,
(δ + µ) (ν + µ) (pφ + µ + ω)
which leads to

β (1 − p) (δ θ + µ θ + ν)
= k(1 − η),

where k is defined by

ζ > 0 by virtue of (10). As constructed, L is a non-negative functional and we have
L = 0 ⇐⇒ (S, A, I, R, P ) = Σ0 .
Now we compute the derivative of L along the solutions of the SAIRP model (1) starting in Ω.

The next theorem establishes the global stability of the endemic equilibrium (EE) Σ+ defined
by (7), in an invariant region Γ ⊂ Ω. It remains an open question to determine if the endemic
equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable in the whole region Ω.

is positively invariant under the flow induced by system (1). It contains the disease-free equilibrium,
Σ0 , and the endemic equilibrium, Σ+ , if R0 > 1. Furthermore, if R0 > 1, then the endemic
equilibrium Σ+ is globally asymptotically stable in Γ.
Proof. Let us first prove that Γ is positively invariant
under the flow induced by system (1). We

denote by x(t, x0 ) = S(t), A(t), I(t), R(t), P (t) the solution of system (1) starting from x0 ∈ Γ.
Summing again the five equations of system (1) leads to
Ṅ (t) + µN (t) = Λ,

t > 0,

where N (t) = S(t) + A(t) + I(t) + R(t) + P (t). Consequently, we have

Now we have N (0) = Λ

is positively invariant. Next, we easily verify that Σ0 and Σ+ belong to Γ. Now we turn to prove
the global stability of Σ+ in Γ. To that aim, we introduce the functional V defined by

3. Model with piecewise constant parameters
The human behavior and the governmental public health decision makers can change the value
of the basic reproduction number, R0 , and consequently the dynamics of model (1). In this section,
we model the human behavior and the impact of the decision makers policies, by considering in
model (1) parameters determined by piecewise constant functions. We prove the existence and
uniqueness of global solutions of the resulting model. We start by subdividing the time line
[0, +∞) into a finite number of n intervals
[T0 , T1 ) ∪ [T1 , T2 ) ∪ · · · ∪ [Tn , +∞),
with disjoint unions, and introduce a piecewise constant function α defined on each time interval
as
α(t) = αi , t ∈ [Ti , Ti+1 ), 0 ≤ i ≤ n,
with T0 = 0, Tn+1 = +∞ and αi
defined for each initial condition x0


x(0) = x0 ,

∈ R9 . Next, we consider the sequence of Cauchy problems
∈ Ω by

ẋ(t) = f x(t), α0 ,

ẋ(t) = f x(t), αi ,

T0 < t < T1 ,
Ti < t < Ti+1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ n .

(15)

t∈(Ti−1 , Ti )

We are now in conditions to derive the existence and uniqueness result.
Proposition 2. For any initial condition x0 ∈ Ω, the sequence of Cauchy problems given by (15)
admits a unique global solution, denoted again by x(t, x0 ), whose components are non-negative.
Furthermore, the region Ω is positively invariant.
Proof. Applying Theorem 1, a finite number of times, directly provides the existence and uniqueness of global solutions to problem (15).
Note that the solutions of problem (15) are continuous on the time interval [T0 , +∞), but
may not be of class C 1 at t = Ti , 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. From the modeling point of view, each change
of parameters occurring at time t = Ti (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1) corresponds, for example, to a public
announcement of confinement/lift of confinement or prohibition of displacement.

11

4. Existence of pseudo-periodic solutions
In this section, we show that piecewise constant parameters can lead to pseudo-periodic solutions. This result has important practical applications in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first concern of governments was to decrease the level of infected individuals. This was achieved, in great part, by confinement decisions.
However, those confinement decisions had a large impact on the economy, and it was important to
decide to lift this ban. Consequently, the risk of a premature relaxation was the second concern of
governments, since it was feared to provoke a second wave of infection. The existence of multiple
epidemic waves in a pandemic can be mathematically justified by the following theorem.
Theorem 5. Assume that the disease-free equilibrium, Σ0 , admits a non-trivial basin of attraction
Ω0 ⊂ Ω if R0 < 1, and that the endemic equilibrium Σ+ admits a non-trivial basin of attraction
Ω+ ⊂ Ω if R0 > 1. Let α0 and α+ denote two sets of parameters of system (1) such that
R0 (α0 ) < 1 and R0 (α+ ) > 1. Let x0 ∈ Ω0 and consider the sequence of Cauchy problems

for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where Ti is such that x(Ti ) ∈ Ω+ , for i odd, and x(Ti ) ∈ Ω0 , for i even. Then the
solution x(t, x0 ), of the latter sequence of Cauchy problems, exhibits pseudo-oscillations between
a neighborhood N0 of Σ0 and a neighborhood N + of Σ+ in Ω.
Proof. The initial condition x0 of the sequence of Cauchy problems (16) has been chosen in Ω0 ,
which is assumed to be the basin of attraction of Σ0 . Since α0 (R0 ) < 1, then the solution x(t, x0 )
is attracted to Σ0 and thus reaches a neighborhood N0 of Σ0 after a finite time T1 . Now it is
assumed that x(T1 ) belongs to the basin of attraction Ω+ of Σ+ . Since α+ (R0 ) > 1, then the
solution x(t, x0 ) is now attracted to Σ+ and thus reaches a neighborhood N + of Σ+ after a finite
time T2 . Next, we assume that x(T2 ) belongs to the basin of attraction Ω0 of Σ0 . Since α0 (R0 ) < 1,
then the solution x(t, x0 ) is now attracted to Σ0 and thus reaches again the neighborhood N0 of
Σ0 after a finite time T3 . Repeating those arguments a finite number of times leads to the desired
conclusion, that is, the solution x(t, x0 ) exhibits pseudo-oscillations between the neighborhoods
N0 and N + of Σ0 and Σ+ , respectively.
Note that the assumption x(T1 ) ∈ Ω+ is directly satisfied for T1 large enough, if Σ0 belongs
to the interior of Ω+ in Ω. Similarly, the assumption x(T2 ) ∈ Ω0 is directly satisfied for T2
large enough, if Σ+ belongs to the interior of Ω0 in Ω. By virtue of Theorem 3, the latter
property is directly satisfied since Ω0 = Ω. A numerical simulation of a solution of the sequence
of Cauchy problems (16), exhibiting pseudo-oscillations between a neighborhood N0 of Σ0 and a
neighborhood N + of Σ+ in Ω, is depicted in Figure 2.
5. Dynamics of a complex network of non-identical SAIRP models
It is now widely admitted that mobilities play an important role on the dynamics of epidemics,
at numerous stages of their development. In this section, we propose to study the propagation of
the COVID-19 outbreak in Portugal by modeling this country by a complex network in which the
six regions studied previously for the calibration of the model (1) are considered.
In a first stage, we show how to construct a complex network of SAIRP models. Let us consider
the six regions of Portugal, as depicted in Figure 3. Those six regions are connected by a finite
number of links that define a graph G = (V , E ) made of a set V of 6 vertices, which correspond
to the six regions (Norte, Centro, Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, Alentejo, Algarve, Pinhal Litoral ), and of
a set E of edges, which model the main connections between those 6 regions. In order to describe

transferred to the protected class P .
the state of each region, we couple each vertex of the graph with one instance of the model (15).
Since each region has its own specificity, we consider that the multiple instances of the model
are non-identical, which means that the values of the parameters can differ from one region to
another.
We introduce the following notations:

with non negative coefficients σS , σA , σI , σR and σP .
Next we define a matrix L of connectivity as follows. For each edge (k, j) ∈ E , k 6= j, we set
Lj,k = εj,k > 0. If (k, j) ∈
/ E , k 6= j, we set Lj,k = 0. The diagonal coefficients satisfy
Lj,j = −

L44 = −(ε24 + ε34 + ε54 ),
L55 = −ε45 ,
L66 = −(ε16 + ε26 + ε36 ).
In this complex network model, we consider that an edge (k, j) ∈ E , k 6= j, models a connection
between two regions k and j, which corresponds to human displacements from region k towards
region j. Moreover, the parameter σS models the rate of susceptible individuals in region k which
migrate towards vertex j. The parameters σA , σI , σR and σP are defined analogously. This
implies that our model can take into account the situation where a part of the population is not
concerned with the migrations. For instance, it is relevant to consider σI = σP = 0, while σS > 0
and σA > 0. The set of edges E and the coupling strengths stored in the matrix H define what is
usually called the topology of the complex network.
Next, we explicit the equations that describe the state of region j ∈ {1, . . . , 6}:

Theorem 6. For any X0 ∈ Θ, the Cauchy problem given by (17) and X(0) = X0 admits a unique

Proof. The existence and uniqueness of local in time solutions is immediate. The non-negativity

which leads to the intended conclusion.
In the next section, we apply previous complex network to the real data from COVID-19 in
Portugal, since the first confirmed active COVID-19 case, in March 2, 2020, until September 17,
2020.
6. Portugal case study: complex network with 6 regions
In this section, we calibrate the number of active infected individuals I given by the SAIRP
model with piecewise constant parameters (15), to six distinct regions from Portugal. We show
that the model allows to fit well the Portuguese real data available in [2]. Taking into account
these parameter values, we perform numerical simulations of the complex network problem (17),
where the main goal is to investigate the effect of the topology on the dynamics of the epidemics,
and determine a topology that minimizes the level of active infected individuals.
6.1. Model with piecewise constant parameters: fitting to real data from 6 Portuguese regions
We first consider the SAIRP model with piecewise constant parameters (15) and show that
the class I fits well the active confirmed cases of infected individuals provided by the Portuguese
National Authorities [2] for six regions of Portugal mainland, as depicted in Figure 3, where (1)
represents the region Norte, (2) Centro, (3) Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, (4) Alentejo, (5) Algarve and
(6) Pinhal Litoral.
The initial conditions S0 , A0 , I0 , R0 and P0 at time t = 1, where t = 1 corresponds to the day
of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in each region, which differ from one region to
another, see Table 1. Namely, the first cases occurred in each region at: Norte, March 2, 2020;
Centro, March 3, 2020; Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, March 3, 2020; Alentejo, March 18, 2020; Algarve,
March 8, 2020.
Some of the parameters take constant values for all the period of time under consideration
and are the same for the six regions, see Table 2. Others, even taking constant values for all time
window, differ from one region to another, see Table 3.
The parameters β, m and p are piecewise continuous, taking different values depending on the
considered time interval and the region, see Tables 4 and 5.
Figures 4–6 show that the SAIRP model (15) with piecewise constant parameters describes
well the active infected cases in the six Portuguese regions under consideration.
Moreover, the active infected cases of all Portugal can also be modeled, see Figure 7.

6.2. Complex network model: numerical simulations for COVID-19 in Portugal
Considering the six regions from Figure 3, and the parameter values from Section 6.1, we perform numerical simulations of the complex network problem (17). The main goal is to investigate
the effect of the topology on the dynamics of the epidemics. In particular, we analyze the existence
of a topology which minimizes the average number of active infected individuals during a fixed
time interval. Moreover, we analyze if other topologies are likely to worsen the level of infection.
In order to model the mobilities of susceptible and asymptomatic individuals, we set σS = σA >
0, whereas we fix σI = σR = σP = 0. We test a sample of 1000 randomly generated topologies

with Python 3.5 language, in a Debian/Gnu-Linux environment. For each integration, we have
computed the number of average number of active infected individuals, that is, individuals of the
class I, per day. The results are depicted in Figure 8, where the average number of active infected
individuals, per day, is depicted for the randomly generated topologies and σS = σA = 0.01, and

coupling strengths σS = σA for a couple of remarkable topologies. The numerical results reveal
the existence of a certain number of topologies that decrease the level of infection, compared to

individuals. This optimal topology is depicted in Figure 10 (b). It is worth noting that this
optimal topology connects the regions Norte, Centro, Lisboa e Vale do Tejo and Pinhal Litoral,
but it does not connect those four regions to Alentejo and Algarve. In parallel, the numerical
simulations exhibit numerous topologies that increase the level of infection. We have presented in

overcome the level of the empty topology. We remark that the topologies that increase the level of
infection seem to connect the 6 regions of Portugal to the region Alentejo. On the other hand, it
can be helpful to authorize parsimonious migrations between regions that have a satisfying control
of the epidemic.
7. Discussion
One of the factors associated with the spread of the pandemic is the mobility of populations.
It was based on this evidence that, in the first phase of the pandemic response, a generalized
containment of the population was implemented in a big number of countries. As a result of this
restriction in the mobility, it was possible to obtain a decrease in the number of infected. In
the numerical simulations considered in this work, for the complex network problem (17), it is

assumed that only susceptible (S) and asymptomatic infected (A) are circulating among the 6
identified regions of mainland Portugal. Starting from the number of active infected people (I) for
the empty topology, in which it is assumed that there are no flows between regions, the results of
the simulations indicate that there are more topologies that increase the number of active infected
people than those that cause this number to decrease. Hence, this result reinforces the need
to reduce circulation between regions as one of the tools to reduce the spread of the virus and
decrease the number of active infected people. Still, it is interesting to note that there are other
topologies (around 1 out of 3) in which the number of active infected individuals decreases with
the movement of people between regions. This finding can be seen in Figure 8, where the average
number of active infected individuals for the 1000 tested topologies is shown. According to the
topology that minimizes the number of active infected individuals, whose representation is shown
in Figure 10 b), it is possible to verify that the strategy of preventing the flow to the regions of
Alentejo (4) and Algarve (5) contributes to reduce the number of active infected. This scenario
was to be expected as those regions have a much lower number of cases than the rest of Portugal.
Bidirectional circulation between Norte (1) and Centro (2) regions leads to a reduction in the
number of active infected people (if one compares with the empty topology), but the movement
between Pinhal Litoral region (6) and Lisboa e Vale do Tejo region (3) should only be done in the
direction to prevent circulation from the region where there are less infected (6) to the region (3)
that has a high number of active cases. In Figure 10 c) it is possible to verify that the existence
of this connection in the direction (6) to (3) increases the number of active cases. The topologies
involving the regions of Alentejo (4) and Algarve (5) increase the number of cases. One extreme
example of such topology can be found in Figure 10 d). In this case, the direction of the flows
presents a topology that converges to the Alentejo (4) and it is expected that this will translate
into an increase in the number of infected (even in the case where the connection strength is small,
as shown in Figure 10 c) and Figure 9 at right), as it is the region where the number of cases is
lesser. The way the epidemic evolves is different between the different regions of a country, but
also between countries. These specific characteristics of context (cultural, demographic, economic,
. . . ) seen in the number of active infected individuals (which is not uniform across regions), can
be modeled by pseudo-periodic piecewise functions, as proved in this work. Accordingly, the
application of such methodology to identify flows between regions or countries is a tool with
enormous potential in the current pandemic context, and can be applied in the management of
outbreaks (in regional terms) but also to manage the opening/closing of borders.

8. Conclusion and future work
The way the epidemic evolves is different between the different regions of a country, but also
between countries. These specific characteristics of context (cultural, demographic, economic, . . . )
seen in the number of active infected individuals, which is not uniform across regions, can be modeled by pseudo-periodic piecewise functions, as proved in this work. Accordingly, the application of
such methodology to identify flows between regions or countries is a tool with enormous potential
in the current pandemic context, and can be applied in the management of outbreaks (in regional
terms) but also to manage the opening/closing of borders. In the implemented simulations, the
intensity of the flows (σS and σA ) are assumed to be equal. Still, and as future work, it would
be useful, in terms of epidemiological management, to be able to model the intensity of flows by
class (Asymptomatic, Susceptible, Active Infected, Recovered, and Protected) between regions.
