Abstract
Motivated by epidemics such as COVID-19, we study the spread of a contagious disease when
behavior responds to the disease’s prevalence. We extend the SIR epidemiological model to
include endogenous meeting rates. Individuals benefit from economic activity, but activity
involves interactions with potentially infected individuals. The main focus is a theoretical
analysis of contagion dynamics and behavioral responses to changes in risk. We obtain a
simple condition for when public-health interventions or changes in disease prevalence will
paradoxically increase infection rates due to risk compensation. Behavioral responses are
most likely to undermine public-health interventions near the peak of severe diseases.

Introduction

In a severe epidemic such as COVID-19, the spread of a contagious disease depends substantially on behavioral and policy responses. Standard epidemiological models often predict
disease paths with and without social distancing, and outcomes can differ dramatically across
these scenarios.1 Given the large impact of responses such as social distancing on infection
dynamics, understanding how much people will interact is an important open question (Funk
et al., 2015).
To analyze the spread of a disease and the accompanying behavioral responses, we adapt
the widely-used SIR (Susceptible/Infected/Recovered) epidemiological model to allow individuals to choose activity levels at each point in time.2 Higher activity levels correspond
to actions such as going to work or school which provide economic and social benefits. On
the other hand, higher activity also leads to more interactions with potentially infected individuals, especially when the disease prevalence is high and when others are more active
(e.g., public spaces are crowded). Given the shares of the population that are susceptible
and infected at a given time, individuals’ choices are determined by a simple game-theoretic
framework.
Allowing people to choose their activity levels has several consequences: infection rates
stop growing because of behavioral responses in addition to herd immunity, and interventions that make interactions safer can be undermined if people respond by interacting more.
Our goal is to characterize when behavioral responses are largest and most important, and
especially when qualitative predictions of the standard SIR model are reversed.
Our initial results characterize the dynamics of the infection and the corresponding behavioral responses. The baseline model considers a population of optimizing agents reacting
myopically to current circumstances.3 In the leading case, disease prevalence is single-peaked:
1
To give a high-profile example, in March 2020 Ferguson et al. (2020) predicted 2.2 million US deaths
from COVID-19 without increased social distancing. Their predicted death toll decreased to 1.1-1.2 million
in a mitigation scenario, and there were further reductions under a more aggressive suppression scenario.
Beyond the differences in death rates, infection dynamics look very different across the scenarios.
2
Our model can be modified to include a probability of death rather than recovery; this does not change
disease dynamics.
3
We begin with myopic agents to obtain sharper results and to avoid assumptions of perfect knowledge
of the future path of the disease, and then extend the model to allow forward-looking agents.

the prevalence initially increases, but then peaks and falls toward zero as behavioral responses
and herd immunity slow the spread. Part of the population will eventually be immune while
others will never be infected, and the relative sizes of these two groups depend on model
parameters and potential policy interventions.
Our main interest is in understanding when behavioral responses are strong enough to
reverse direct epidemiological effects. We find that an epidemic can be in a state where three
counterintuitive comparative statics hold simultaneously:
• Increasing the disease prevalence decreases the infection rate.
• Decreasing the transmission rate increases the infection rate.
• Decreasing the cost of infection increases the flow costs from new infections.
Indeed, any of these holds if and only if the others do. We define a high infection risk
condition that characterizes the disease states where these comparative statics occur. To
illustrate the second bullet point, if the high infection risk condition holds, then requiring
masks (without also requiring social distancing) may actually increase the infection rate
because interactions will increase. We can decompose each comparative static into a term
capturing the direct effect, which is the same as in the standard SIR model, and a behavioral
response term. When the risk of infection is large enough, the behavioral response can
outweigh the direct effect.
Indeed, previous models (beginning with Kremer, 1996) have suggested public-health
interventions to decrease transmissivity could actually increase infection rates. A dynamic
model lets us determine whether and when in the course of a disease this is likely to occur.
The high infection risk condition implies that these counterintuitive effects require a severe
disease and a high prevalence. With a large infection cost and a high prevalence, there
is substantial social distancing and so behavioral responses that weaken social distancing
are most consequential. As a result, near the peak of a severe outbreak, public-health
interventions can be less effective or even counterproductive unless paired with attempts to
maintain social distancing. When prevalence is lower, changes that decrease transmission
rates such as requiring masks are quite effective. In a simple calibration exercise based on
COVID-19, we find a high infection risk region with a higher baseline reproductive number of
2

R0 = 5.7 but not with a lower value of R0 = 2.4, suggesting that the direction of behavioral
effects varies within a plausible range of epidemiological parameters.4
The model remains analytically tractable with heterogeneous populations, such as people facing different costs of infection due to age or health risks. The framework can also
accommodate biased matching between types, which can capture underlying social structure or geography (as in Birge, Candogan, and Feng, 2020). We give a formula expressing
equilibrium activity levels in terms of the current population and model parameters. With
heterogeneity, high-risk individuals may temporarily avoid any activity because the infection
risk from low-risk people is too high. Upon leaving the economy, high-risk individuals are reluctant to reenter and will wait until the disease prevalence is lower than when they stopped
their activity. These differences in behavior can explain patterns in COVID-19 cases, where
older populations accounted for a much smaller share of infections near the peak than early
in the outbreak (Malmgren, Gou, and Kaplan, 2020). The techniques used to incorporate
preference heterogeneity also allow modifications to the disease mechanics, such as imperfect
immunity for recovered individuals.
We also extend our basic results on risk compensation to allow more general incentive
structures. First, we allow strategic spillovers in social and economic activity: activity
may become more or less desirable as others social distance. Strategic complementarities
amplify behavioral responses while strategic substitutes weaken behavioral responses. In
heterogeneous populations there may be spillovers in both directions, and we characterize the
strength of behavioral responses more generally. Second, we show that a quadratic functional
form assumption in our baseline model can be relaxed. Third, we allow for forward-looking
agents who consider future social distancing and future infection risk when evaluating the
value of avoiding infection today.
4
These values are obtained from studies by Li et al. (2020) and Sanche et al. (2020) and are representative
of low-to-moderate and higher estimates of the reproductive number from the epidemiological literature,
respectively. The baseline reproductive number is also context-dependent, with a higher reproductive number
more likely in denser locations and subpopulations.

1.1

Related Literature

Much of behavioral epidemiology focuses on individuals’ binary choices, such as vaccination,
rather than more continuous choices of how much to interact with others (e.g., Geoffard
and Philipson, 1997, Galvani, Reluga, and Chapman, 2007, and several chapters of Manfredi
and D’Onofrio, 2013). This is especially relevant for less severe or less contagious diseases.
For example, for influenza in ordinary years, vaccination choices are likely the most relevant
behavioral margin for most individuals. But when individuals are en gaged in substantial
social distancing, choice sets are much richer.
Several models of HIV/AIDS epidemics allow individuals to choose numbers of sexual
partners (see Kremer, 1996, Auld, 2003, Greenwood, Kircher, Santos, and Tertilt, 2019,
and others). We note two key differences from our model. First, this literature treats
HIV/AIDS as an endemic disease at steady state. By contrast, we argue that infection
dynamics are important for outbreaks such as COVID-19, which led to dramatic shifts in
behavior.5 Second, HIV/AIDS modeling uses the SI (Susceptible/Infected) rather than SIR
model, as infection is an absorbing state. We develop a model that allows theoretical analysis
of diseases conferring immunity, which require a higher-dimensional state space.
Several theoretical papers, including some very recent ones, have studied endogenous
social distancing over the course of an epidemic (including Fenichel et al., 2011, Fenichel,
2013, Toxvaerd, 2019, Toxvaerd, 2020, and McAdams, 2020). We emphasize three main
differences. First, our focus is on how behavioral responses vary with risk levels, and especially on responses to policy changes or shocks that make interactions safer.6 We aim for as
complete a characterization as possible of the relevant derivatives. In contrast, past work
focuses on the basic structure of incentives and externalities. Second, we allow heterogeneity in epidemiological characteristics such as disease risk and in economic preferences, while
prior theoretical models of social distancing only consider the homogeneous case. Third,
we allow strategic complements or substitutes in interaction (as in McAdams, 2020), and
find an intuitive relationship between these economic feedback effects and epidemiological
5

A third approach, which Acemoglu, Malekian, and Ozdaglar (2016) use to model security in computer
networks, assumes agents choose a fixed level of protection and then a virus spreads over time.

Toxvaerd (2019) provides a numerical example where risk compensation can reduce welfare with decentralized behavior and shows that reducing infection risk cannot be harmful if a social planner sets behavior.

outcomes.
In response to COVID-19, a number of economists have incorporated endogenous behavior into calibrated numerical analyses of SIR models. These models, such as Farboodi,
Jarosch, and Shimer (2020), Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt (2020), Krueger, Uhlig,
and Xie (2020), and Korinek and Bethune (2020), focus largely on macroeconomic consequences of epidemics, and therefore include additional features such as production sectors or
tradeoffs between labor and leisure. While we also include simulations, our focus is on the
theoretical properties of the SIR model with endogenous behavior. A major takeaway from
our analysis is that basic qualitative properties of disease dynamics and impulse responses
can be reversed by changes in model parameters. A simple calibration exercise shows that
these reversals can occur within a range of parameters seen as plausible in epidemiological
literature on COVID-19.

Model

2.1

Setup

We consider a model in continuous time, indexed by t ∈ [0, ∞), with a unit mass of individuals. Individuals can be susceptible, infected, or recovered. We denote the shares of
susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals at time t by S(t), I(t), and R(t), respectively.
We will refer to the shares (S(t), I(t), R(t)) as the population disease state.
Each individual chooses a level of activity q(t) ≥ 0 to maximize her expected flow payoffs
at time t. The flow payoffs from activity are
q(t) − aq(t)2 ,
where a > 0. This captures economic and social value from actions that can involve meeting other people, such as going to work or school. The marginal value of these actions is
decreasing, and absent infection individuals will choose the finite level of activity q =

1
.
2a

A

susceptible individual pays instantaneous cost C ≥ 0 if infected.
We now describe the infection process. When levels of activity are (qS (t), qI (t), qR (t)), an
5

individual choosing level of activity rate qi (t) meets susceptible individuals at Poisson rate
qi (t)qS (t)S(t), infected individuals at rate qi (t)qI (t)I(t), and recovered individuals at rate
qi (t)qR (t)R(t).7 That is, individuals meet according to quadratic matching (Diamond and
Maskin, 1979). All meetings are independent.
When a susceptible individual meets an infected individual, she becomes infected with
transmission probability β > 0. Infected individuals recover at Poisson rate κ, and then are
immune in all future periods (see Section 5.3 for a discussion of partial immunity).
When C = 0, all individuals choose q(t) = q and the model reduces to the standard SIR
model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927). For C > 0, the meeting rates between individuals
will depend on choices of q(t).

2.2

Equilibrium

A sequence of (symmetric) action profiles is given by (qS (t), qI (t), qR (t))∞
t=0 .
Recovered individuals know that they are recovered. Susceptible and infected individuals know that they have not recovered but not whether they are infected, and therefore
believe they are susceptible with probability

S(t)
S(t)+I(t)

and infected with probability

I(t)
S(t)+I(t)

at time t. Our interpretation is that infected individuals are pre-symptomatic but can spread
the disease.8 (We will discuss a model with equivalent dynamics which explicitly includes
symptomatic individuals in Remark 1.)
Susceptible and infected individuals face the same decision problem. So, it will be without
loss of generality to consider sequences of actions such that qS (t) = qI (t) for all t, and any
such sequence is characterized by (qS (t), qR (t))∞
t=0 .
A sequence of action profiles is an equilibrium if individuals choose activity levels to
maximize flow payoffs at all times, given the population disease state and others’ actions:
Definition 1. An equilibrium given initial conditions (S(0), I(0), R(0)) is a sequence of
7

Since individuals have a unique optimal action qi (t) for each t, we can assume without loss of generality
that individuals with the same infection status choose the same level of activity.
8
The model can be extended to allow a fraction of infected individuals who do not develop symptoms, and
therefore do not know that when they recover. Introducing asymptomatic infections changes individuals’
beliefs about their probability of being susceptible.

qS (t) = argmaxq q − aq − CqqS (t)β ·
S(t) + I(t)

(1)


qR (t) = argmaxq q − aq 2 .

(2)

We now explain the infection costs in the definition. An individual i choosing level of
activity qi (t) at time t meets infected individuals at rate qi (t)qS (t)I(t), and meetings with
susceptible and recovered individuals are not relevant for i’s payoffs. If individual i is not yet
recovered, then she believes she is susceptible with probability

S(t)
S(t)+I(t)

and already infected

otherwise. Since the transmission rate is β, she would be infected by a meeting with an
infected individual at time t with probability β ·

S(t)
.
S(t)+I(t)

The expected rate of infection is

I(t)S(t)
therefore qi (t)qS (t)β · S(t)+I(t)
, as in equation (1). If the individual is recovered, there are no

infection costs, which gives equation (2).
Remark 1. Under the quadratic matching technology, the behavior of recovered individuals
does not affect equilibrium behavior by susceptible individuals or the infection rate. Thus,
our model is equivalent to a number of extensions with additional heterogeneity among
individuals who cannot infect others or be infected.9 As one example, infected individuals
could be replaced by presymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, where symptomatic
individuals choose q(t) = 0 to avoid spreading the disease.10 A second example is including
a death rate for infected individuals, so that there are two absorbing states.

3

Dynamics

Our first results describe the basic dynamics of the disease. Consider an initial population
with I(0) > 0 and R(0) = 0. We will be most interested in the dynamics starting from a
small initial prevalence I(0).
9

These modifications of course have welfare consequences, but behavior and infection dynamics are equivalent.
10
Individuals who are not yet symptomatic do not know whether they are susceptible or presymptomatic,
and form beliefs as in the baseline model. Presymptomatic individuals become symptomatic at Poisson rate
κ and symptomatic individuals recover at some Poisson rate. At each time t, the infected population in the
baseline model matches the presymptomatic population in the modified model and the recovered population
in the baseline model matches the combined symptomatic and recovered populations in the modified model.

7

Recovered individuals choose qR (t) = q for all t, where q =

1
.
2a

Therefore, an equilibrium

is characterized by the level of activity qS (t) ≤ q for susceptible and infected individuals,
which we will refer to as q(t) from now on.
An individual i who is susceptible or infected chooses qi (t) to maximize
qi (t) − aqi (t)2 − Cβqi (t)q(t) ·

I(t)S(t)
.
S(t) + I(t)

Taking the first-order condition for qi (t) and substituting qi (t) = q(t), we obtain
q(t) =

1
2a + Cβ ·

I(t)S(t)
S(t)+I(t)

(3)

This expression implies that the level of activity q(t) is decreasing in the susceptible population S(t) and the prevalence I(t) (drawing the additional susceptible or infected individuals
from the recovered population). If the infected population is larger, then activity is more
dangerous because individual i is more likely to meet infected peers. If the susceptible
population is larger, then individual i is less likely to already be infected.
The population dynamics are characterized by the differential equations
Ṡ(t) = −q(t)2 βS(t)I(t)
˙ = q(t)2 βS(t)I(t) − κI(t)
I(t)
Ṙ(t) = κI(t).
We will also be interested in the infection rate ι(t), which is equal to −Ṡ(t).
The baseline reproductive number R0 =

βq 2
κ

is the expected number of others who an

infected individual would infect in the absence of behavioral responses or immunity. When
R0 is less than one, the prevalence I(t) is monotonically decreasing for all t given any initial
prevalence and any cost C ≥ 0. In this case, a small number of cases cannot lead to a
larger outbreak. The remainder of the paper analyzes the case in which the transmission
probability is high enough for the prevalence to increase (given a small enough initial infected
population), and so maintains the following assumption:

8

Figure 1: Recovered population over time for infection costs C equal to zero (solid blue),
equal to the value of three months of normal activity (dashed red), and equal to the value
of six months of normal activity (dash-dotted yellow). The reproductive number is R0 = 2.4
and the average disease length is 14 days.
Assumption 1 (High enough transmissivity). R0 =

βq 2
κ

> 1.

We begin with a basic result about the long-run population.
Proposition 1. Suppose that S(0) > 0 and I(0) > 0. Then limt→∞ I(t) = 0 and limt→∞ R(t) ∈
(0, 1).
The proposition says that the disease prevalence eventually approaches zero and that
some individuals will never be infected. While contagion vanishes due to herd immunity, the
eventual fraction of the population who has had the disease depends on behavior and any
policy interventions. We define R(∞) = limt→∞ R(t) to be the fraction of the population
that is eventually infected.
Examples show that behavioral responses can have a large effect on R(∞). To see this,
consider an example with reproductive number R0 = 2.4 and average disease length of 14
days (see Section 4.3 for details on the choice of parameter values). The eventual fraction
infected R(∞) is 88% with C = 0 (no behavioral response) but drops to 64% when the health
cost C from infection is equal to the value of three months of normal activity and to 61%
9

with C equal to the value of six months of normal activity (Figure 1). Thus, the model with
endogenous behavior predicts a substantially smaller share of the population will eventually
be infected than the standard SIR model would suggest.
Behavioral responses also matter for the speed of convergence since social distancing slows
down herd immunity effects. In Figure 1, almost all infections occur within three months
with zero infection costs while almost all infections occur within two years with moderate
infection costs.
We will discuss how shocks or policy changes affect R(∞) below. Before doing so, we
describe the disease path.
Proposition 2. For initial disease prevalence I(0) > 0 sufficiently small, if I(t) ≤ S(t) for
all t < t∗ where t∗ ≤ ∞, then the prevalence I(t) is single-peaked on the interval [0, t∗ ].
The proposition says that as long as the infected population is not larger than the susceptible population, the prevalence of the disease is single peaked. Figure 2 shows the path
of the disease and behavior in a simple example.
If the population infected I(t) is much larger than the susceptible population S(t), then
the prevalence may increase again late in the epidemic. The intuition is that in this case,
most individuals who have not yet recovered are unlikely to be susceptible. This mitigates
infection risk and leads to more interaction. The proof gives a necessary condition for the
increased interaction to increase disease prevalence (see Section 4 for similar effects); the
condition requires I(t) > S(t) but is actually substantially stronger. This effect seems
unlikely to occur in practice, as it would require unusually large prevalences for a severe
disease.
There are several more plausible explanations for multiple waves in our model. First,
temporary lockdowns which restrict actions q(t) to be below some exogenous level will generate a second wave if they are sufficiently strict and lifted sufficiently early. Second, if
people respond to the population disease state at a lag (i.e., at time t all individuals act as if
the current disease state is (S(t − τ ), I(t − τ ), R(t − τ )) for some τ > 0), then the prevalence
need not be single-peaked.
The condition I(t) ≤ S(t) in Proposition 2 depends on the endogenous parameters I(t)
10

Figure 2: Basic dynamics of the population and behavior with I(t) single-peaked. Graphs
show the time paths of S(t), I(t), and R(t) (top) and q(t) (bottom), with R0 = 2.4, average
disease length 14 days, and infection cost equal to the value of six months of normal activity.
11

and S(t). We can also state the single-peakedness result in terms of exogenous parameters,
such as the disease cost and transmission rate.
Corollary 1. There exist constants 0 < δ < δ such that if Cβ < δ or Cβ > δ, then the
prevalence I(t) is single-peaked for I(0) > 0 sufficiently small.
The single-peaked prevalence result holds for Cβ sufficiently small or sufficiently large.
The threshold levels δ and δ for Cβ may depend on a and κ. We could also have formulated
the corollary for other parameters, i.e., the prevalence is single-peaked when a or κ are
sufficiently large.

4

Risk Compensation

We next ask when changes in infection risk have counterintuitive effects due to large changes
in behavior. Decreasing the disease prevalence or intervening to mitigate health impacts
will increase the short-run infection rate precisely when a single high infection risk condition
holds:
Definition 2. There is high infection risk at time t if
Cβ ·

S(t)I(t)
> 2a.
I(t) + S(t)

(4)

We will see that behavioral responses to policies are most important when there is high
infection risk. Expression (4) requires a high cost of infection and large populations of
susceptible and infected individuals. Note that higher infection costs make a large infected
population less likely, so such a region will only exist for diseases that are severe and highly
contagious.

4.1

Increased Prevalence

The first consequence of high infection risk is that infection rates are decreasing in disease
prevalence, holding the recovered population fixed.

12

Let (S x (t), I x (t), Rx (t)) = (S(t) − x, I(t) + x, R(t)) and let ιx (t) be the corresponding
infection rate. We ask how the infection rate varies with x, which can be interpreted as
capturing exogenous differences in the population disease state due to shocks such as travel
or variation in initial conditions when the disease is discovered.
Proposition 3. Suppose there are more susceptible individuals than infected individuals
(I(t) < S(t)) at time t. Then the infection rate is decreasing in the disease prevalence, i.e.,
∂ιx (t)
(0) < 0,
∂x
if and only if there is high infection risk at time t.
During severe outbreaks, a larger number of individuals infected near the peak can lead
to more social distancing. The proposition says that this could be large enough to decrease
infection rate.
The proof shows that

behavioral effect

Increasing the disease prevalence has two effects. First, the positive term corresponds to
the direct effect of the change in the infection rate holding behavior fixed, which is positive
whenever I(t) < S(t).11 But second, the negative term corresponds to the effects of the
change in behavior in response to the increased infection. A higher prevalence leads to a
lower level of activity q(t) (when I(t) < S(t)), which lowers the infection rate. Condition (4)
determines whether the behavioral effect is larger than the direct effect. By contrast, the
standard SIR model only captures the direct effect.
A similar effect occurs in the steady state model of Quercioli and Smith (2006), where
individuals meet at an exogenous rate but can take protective actions. In a model where
disease prevalence changes over time, we find this comparative static coincides with other
11

When I(t) > S(t), instead

∂ιx (t)
∂x (0)

> 0 if and only if there is high infection risk at time t.

13

risk compensation effects: we next show the high infection risk condition also determines
whether behavioral responses outweigh the direct effects of several policy changes.

4.2

Policy

We next consider the effects of changes in the cost C from infection and the transmission
rate β, which correspond to public-health measures that change the spread of the disease.
An example of a policy to decrease β is recommending or requiring individuals wear masks.
An example of a policy to decrease C is developing a partially effective treatment.
Our high infection risk condition again determines the sign of the impact of these policies.
Proposition 4. The following are equivalent:
(1) There is high infection risk at time t,
(2) Marginally decreasing the transmission rate β at time t increases the infection rate ι(t),
and
(3) Marginally decreasing the infection cost C at time t increases the flow costs Cι(t) from
infections.
The proposition says that these policies to decrease β and C increase short-term flow
costs from infection in the same region, which is characterized by high prevalence and a high
cost of infection. Formally, (2) and (3) state the inequalities
∂ι(t)
∂(Cι(t))
< 0 and
<0
∂β
∂C
at the initial values of β and C.
The model suggests that considering behavioral responses to public health policies is
most important for severe diseases and close to the peak of outbreaks. Near the peak,
public health interventions will tend to be less effective or even counterproductive unless
paired with campaigns or restrictions to encourage social distancing. When prevalence is
low, public health measures such as requiring masks are much more effective.

14

Related models find that partially effective vaccines can increase infection rates. This
was first observed by (Kremer, 1996) for HIV/AIDS. Toxvaerd (2019) and Talamàs and
Vohra (2020) show partially effective vaccines can also decrease welfare due to the negative
externalities from infection. We provide a general framework that determines when several
counterintuitive comparative statics, including the effect from Kremer (1996), will occur for
contagious diseases such as COVID-19. We find that partially effective vaccines will increase
infection rates precisely in a high infection risk region, which is also when a lower disease
prevalence increases infection rates and where partially effective treatments increase flow
costs from infections.

4.3

Calibration

We now perform a simple calibration exercise to give intuition for when there will be a high
infection risk. We find that high infection risk is unlikely under low-to-moderate estimates
of R0 for COVID-19 but likely near peak prevalence under higher estimates of R0 .
The model is specified (up to normalizations) by the basic reproductive number R0 =

βq 2
κ

before immunity or behavioral responses, the average disease length κ1 , and a preference parameter

C
.
4a

The preference parameter measures the time period of normal activity generating

utility equal to the infection cost.
A meta-analysis of 12 epidemiological studies found estimates of R0 for COVID-19 from
1.4 to 6.49, with several estimates near the minimum and maximum values (Liu et al.,
2020).12 We describe simulations under a moderate value of R0mod = 2.4 (Li et al., 2020)
and a high value of R0high = 5.7 (Sanche et al., 2020) from subsequent studies. The comparison can be thought of as incorporating epidemiological uncertainty and/or variation across
geographic locations and populations, with higher R0 likely in denser and more socially
connected communities.
We take the average disease length

1
κ

to be 14 days, which is approximately twice the

estimated serial interval between infections (Sanche et al., 2020).13 In each case, we assume
12

Much of this literature takes behavior to be exogenous. When there is substantial social distancing in
observed data, this may bias estimates of the reproductive number R0 under normal activity downward.
13
Some work has estimated substantially shorter infectious periods, e.g., 3.5 days in Li et al. (2020). A
shorter average disease length would give stronger behavioral responses in our calibration.

the cost of infection is equal to the flow payoffs from six months of normal activity. This is
comparable to existing estimates from macroeconomic models of COVID-19, which estimate
an infection cost ranging from slightly over three months to twelve months of the value of
US per capita consumption (see Farboodi, Jarosch, and Shimer, 2020 for a discussion). The
results we now discuss also hold for other values between three and twelve months.

in solid red for each of the two values of R0 . There is high infection risk when the solid
red curve is positive. When the reproductive number is R0mod = 2.4, there is not a high
infection risk region; though behavioral responses still matter for comparative statics, they
will be less important than direct effects. When the reproductive number is R0high = 5.7,
the high infection risk condition holds near and after the epidemic’s peak. This suggests
that behavioral forces can differ substantially within a plausible range of epidemiological
parameters.

Heterogeneity

We now incorporate heterogeneity in economic preferences and epidemiological characteristics. We begin by characterizing equilibrium actions given an arbitrary type space. Restricting to two types, we explicitly describe the behavior of high-risk and low-risk populations
over time. The techniques we introduce also permit changes to the infection model such as
partial immunity.

5.1

Equilibrium

A feature of our model with quadratic utility is that behavior continues to take a simple
analytic form with heterogeneous populations. We first give a procedure for determining
equilibrium actions at a given time t.
Suppose there are m types with each type k constituting a share αk of the population.
Each type has infection cost Ck and receives flow payoffs q − ak q 2 . Variation in C can
capture differences in health risk due to age and comorbidities. Variation in preferences can
also distinguish essential and non-essential workers. We will allow for heterogeneous social
17

structure via biased meeting probabilities and spillovers between types below.
For each k we let Sk (t), Ik (t), and Rk (t) be the population share of susceptible, infected,
and recovered individuals of type k at time t, so that Sk (t) + Ik (t) + Rk (t) = αk . As in the
homogeneous case, recovered individuals choose qk (t) = q for all t. An equilibrium strategy
is now given by levels of activity (qk (t))m
k=1 for susceptible or infected individuals of each
type such that
(
qk (t) = argmaxq

q − ak q 2 − C k q ·

m
X

!

Sk (t)
qk0 (t)Ik0 (t) β ·
Sk (t) + Ik (t)
k0 =1

)

for all k and all t.
The maximization problem differs from the homogeneous case in that (1) the infection
cost and the probability of being susceptible now differ across types and (2) the probability
of meeting infected agents of another type now depends on the infection prevalence and
activity level for that type, as captured by the summation across types k 0 .
In the homogeneous case, the equilibrium activity level q(t) is always positive. If all other
individuals chose q(t) = 0, then activity would be safe and so the best response would be
q(t) = q. A key difference under heterogeneity is that high-risk types may choose q(t) = 0
because low-risk types are active enough to make any positive level of activity unsafe. That
is, if there are enough low-risk infected people in public spaces, high-risk people may stay
home entirely.
Consider an equilibrium at time t at which some set of types A ⊂ {1, . . . , m} choose
positive activity levels while other types k ∈
/ A choose qk (t) = 0. Then the activity levels
of individuals in A are determined by the corresponding first-order conditions. Letting


MA = Ck β · Ik (t)+Sk (t)
, equilibrium activity is
k,k0 ∈A

(qk (t))k∈A = (MA + 2 · diag(ak ))−1 1.

(5)

Here diag(ak ) is the diagonal matrix with entries ak and 1 is the column vector of ones.
To determine the set of types A choosing positive actions at equilibrium, we begin with
all types in A0 = {1, . . . , m}. Given Aj , we obtain Aj+1 by removing from Aj all types k

18

such that the k th entry of MAj + 2 · diag(ak )

−1

1 is negative. The following proposition

shows that this process stabilizes within at most m steps and that equilibrium activity is
given by equation (5) with A = Am .
Proposition 5. Equilibrium activity is given by
(qk (t))k∈Am = (MAm + 2 · diag(ak ))−1 1
and qk (t) = 0 for k ∈
/ Am .
The proposition gives a procedure for determining which types will choose positive activity, and expresses these types’ behavior in terms of model parameters and state variables.
Since people play a quadratic game at each time t, we obtain a simpler expression for behavior
than other functional forms for utility would allow. The procedure repeatedly removes types
for whom equation (5) does not give a feasible activity level. The strategic substitutability
of actions at time t ensures this process does characterize the equilibrium.
The characterization in equation (5) can be extended to allow biased matching, though
determining the set A of types choosing positive activity may be more complicated. For
example, we could let individuals of type k meet individuals of type k 0 in each disease state
at rates γkk0 qk (t)qk0 (t)Sk0 (t), γkk0 qk (t)qk0 (t)Ik0 (t), and γkk0 qk (t)qk0 (t)Rk0 (t) for some symmetric matrix (γkk0 )1≤k,k0 ≤m . The weights γkk0 allow a biased matching process, with meeting
probabilities depending on factors such as geography or social structure as well as activity

levels. Then equation (5) holds with MA = Ck βγkk0 · Ikk(t)+Sk0k (t)
.
k,k0 ∈A

We will see that the quadratic functional form can also accommodate spillovers in economic activity, which can vary arbitrarily across pairs of types k and k 0 (Appendix B). We
show there that our main risk compensation results do not rely on homogeneous populations. With heterogeneity, comparative statics in prevalence, the transmission rate, and the
infection cost all continue to depend on the same expression.

19

5.2

Two Types

One important case is heterogeneity in health risks. We next discuss the dynamics when there
are two types with costs C1 and C2 , who we will call young and old individuals respectively.
For simplicity we assume unbiased matching and assume that both types have the same flow
payoffs q(t) − aq(t)2 .
With a small initial prevalence, both types will interact and become infected at positive
rates early or late enough in the outbreak. But if the gap between the types’ infection costs
is large enough, then only young people will choose positive activity levels near the peak.
Proposition 6. Old individuals choose positive activity level q2 (t) > 0 if and only if
C2 β ·

I1 (t)S2 (t)
I1 (t)S1 (t)
≥ 2a + C1 β ·
.
S2 (t) + I2 (t)
I1 (t) + S1 (t)

If old individuals stop choosing q2 (t) > 0 at time t1 and resume choosing q2 (t) > 0 again at
time t2 , then I1 (t1 ) > I1 (t2 ).
The first part of the proposition describes when old individuals choose zero activity in
terms of the population disease state and model parameters. The second part states that if
old individuals stop interacting with others at some time, they will not stop again until the
disease prevalence among young people is strictly lower than when they stopped.
So if one group leaves the economy, it is more difficult to convince them to resume
activity. The main force is that if an individual has not engaged in any activity for a long
period (and has not contracted the disease and recovered), that individual is very likely to
be susceptible. Thus, infection becomes a bigger concern over time, and returning to the
economy requires safer conditions than were acceptable before leaving. The proof shows this
intuition continues to hold after allowing for changes in young people’s behavior over time.
Figure 4 shows an example of the infection rates (top) and levels of activity (bottom) in
each group. In the figure, the two groups are equally sized and I1 (0) = I2 (0) = 0.001 while
the remaining initial population is susceptible. The infection costs are equal to the value of
three months of normal activity for the low-risk group and one year of normal activity for
the high group. We consider the higher value of R0 = 5.7 from Section 4.3.
20

Figure 4: High-risk individuals may choose qk (t) = 0 when prevalence is high. Graphs show
the time paths of Ik (t) (top) and qk (t) (bottom) for low-risk indiviudals (dashed blue) and
high-risk individuals (solid red). Each group has size αk = 12 , and infection costs C1 and C2
are equal to the value of three months of normal activity and one year of normal activity,
respectively. The reproductive number is R0 = 5.7 and the average disease length is 14 days.
21

We have I1 (t) ≈ 0.20 when old individuals cease activity and I2 (t) ≈ 0.17 when old
individuals resume activity. The threshold infection rate for ceasing activity is higher than
the threshold for resuming activity. We also observe that when old individuals resume
activity, they do so rapidly. Indeed, when the gap between the costs C1 and C2 is larger
than in this example figure, the rapid resumption of activity can lead to a non-monotonicity
in q2 (t) as young individuals decrease activity when old individuals return to the economy.
Evidence on COVID-19 trends by age matches Proposition 6 and Figure 4. For example,
epidemiological work in Washington state (Malmgren, Gou, and Kaplan, 2020) found that
older individuals accounted for a substantial share of COVID-19 infections early in the
outbreak but a smaller share of infections near the peak, likely due to differences in behavioral
responses across age groups.
Several recent numerical models have also introduced heterogeneity, with a focus on
lockdowns targeted at older individuals (Brotherhood, Kircher, Santos, and Tertilt, 2020
and Acemoglu, Chernozhukov, Werning, and Whinston, 2020). We instead describe the
decentralized behavior of each group in a heterogeneous population analytically. One finding
under our behavioral specification is that targeted lockdowns may not always be binding,
even if these policies are quite strict.

5.3

Partial Immunity

The approach we have used to allow heterogeneity in preferences can also be used to modify
the set of possible infection statuses. We discuss one example, partial immunity, in this
section. While immunity to COVID-19 is not yet well understood, evidence from previous
coronaviruses suggests some immunity is likely but the duration is unclear (Kissler et al.,
2020).
We assume that recovered individuals can be infected from interactions with infected
individuals, but are infected with probability 0 < β R < β. All infected individuals transition
to the recovered state at Poisson rate κ.
Individuals know whether they have ever recovered but not whether they are currently
infected. That is, there are now four infection statuses. We refer to the corresponding population shares as (S(t), IS (t), R(t), IR (t)), where IS (t) measures individuals who are infected
22

for the first time and IR (t) measures individuals who have recovered and become infected
again. Individuals who have not yet recovered believe they are susceptible with probability
S(t)
S(t)+IS (t)

and infected otherwise. Individuals who have recovered at least once believe they

are recovered with probability

R(t)
R(t)+IR (t)

and infected otherwise.

Partial or temporary immunity could be implemented in several other ways, such as
recovered individuals who are initially immune but become susceptible again at a Poisson
rate. Assuming that partial immunity is independent across interactions maintains a finite
type space, as the behavior of recovered individuals does not depend on the time since
recovery.
Because there are finitely many types, we can derive the behavior of each type with the
same approach as in Proposition 5. We omit the details and discuss long-run dynamics.
There are now two possibilities for the long-run prevalence under the high enough transmissivity assumption.
Let I(t) = IS (t) + IR (t) be the total disease prevalence.
Proposition 7. Suppose I(0) > 0. If R0 <

β
,
βR

then I(t) → 0. If R0 >

β
,
βR

then

lim inf t I(t) > 0.
If recovered individuals are unlikely to be infected again, then the disease will eventually
die out. Once enough individuals have been infected once, the virus reproduces too slowly
to sustain infections. If recovered individuals are sufficiently likely to be infected again,
then the disease becomes endemic. In this case, with a fixed population each susceptible
individual will eventually be infected with probability one.

6

Payoff Structure

We show that our risk compensation results from Section 4 generalize beyond myopic agents
with utility function q − aq 2 for economic activity. We first show that behavioral responses
are strengthened by strategic complementarities and weakened by strategic substitutability.
Second, we allow the flow payoffs from economic activity to be a general concave function.
Third, we consider forward-looking agents with an arbitrary discount rate.

23

6.1

Strategic Spillovers

We first extend the quadratic functional form to allow activity levels to be strategic complements or substitutes. Economic activity may become more attractive when others social
distance, as opportunities for social interaction and exchange decrease, or less attractive, as
competition may decrease.
In this subsection, we first allow spillovers in a homogeneous population and then allow
spillovers that depend on types. Consider flow payoffs from activity

where a > 0 and b < 2a. The integral is taken over all individuals j, and allows incentives
to depend on the average action in the population. Actions are strategic complements for
b > 0 and substitutes for b < 0.
The definition of equilibrium becomes:
Definition 3. An equilibrium given initial conditions (S(0), I(0), R(0)) is a sequence of
action profiles (qS (t), qR (t))∞
t=0 such that for all t

where the average action

qj (t) is equal to (S(t) + I(t))qS (t) + R(t)qR (t).

The equilibrium action qR (t) of recovered individuals is no longer constant, because the
optimal value of qR (t) depends on qS (t) and the size of the recovered population. Equations (7) and (8) give linear first-order conditions for qS (t) and qR (t), and we can solve for
the equilibrium action14

(9)

Because we assume a > 0 and b < 2a, there exists a unique equilibrium and the activity levels are
positive at equilibrium.

24

Our baseline results from Section 3 remain similar; the proof of Proposition 1 does not
use the functional form of payoffs and the proof of Propostition 2 is easily adapted. We
extend our risk compensation results from Section 4.
Definition 4. There is high infection risk at time t if

on the right-hand side is positive under strategic substitutes and negative under strategic
complements. So high infection risk is easier to achieve under strategic complements and
harder to achieve under strategic substitutes.
As in Proposition 3, we take (S x (t), I x (t), Rx (t)) = (S(t) − x, I(t) + x, R(t)) and let ιx (t)
be the corresponding infection rate. The following two propositions hold, just as in the
baseline model.
Proposition 30 . Suppose I(t) < S(t). Then

∂ιx (t)

< 0 if and only if there is high infection

Proposition 40 . The following are equivalent:
(1) There is high infection risk at time t,
(2) Marginally decreasing β at time t increases ι(t), and
(3) Marginally decreasing C at time t increases Cι(t).
As in Section 4, strong behavioral responses occur in the high infection risk region.

behavioral response to changes in environment or policy is larger when actions are strategic

more desirable as others social distance more.

is larger. This tends to

be when S(t)+I(t) is larger, because susceptible and infected individuals respond directly to
changes in risk levels while recovered individuals only respond to others’ changes. This need
not be the case if there are strong enough complementarities for 2a − b is small, however.
In Appendix B, we characterize the role of spillovers beyond the homogeneous case. With
a heterogeneous population, there may be positive spillovers between some individuals and
negative spillovers between others. The effects of spillovers on behavioral responses are no
longer as straightforward, but turn out to still depend on a single high infection risk condition.
So our basic finding that comparative statics in prevalence, the transmission rate, and the
infection cost depend on the same expression is robust to heterogeneous payoff structures.

6.2

General Flow Payoffs

We next relax the quadratic utility function from the baseline model. Consider flow payoffs
from activity f (qi ), where f is twice differentiable, strictly concave, increasing at zero, and
decreasing for qi sufficiently large.15
The definition of equilibrium becomes:
Definition 5. An equilibrium given initial conditions (S(0), I(0), R(0)) is a sequence of
action profiles (qS (t), qR (t))∞
t=0 such that for all t


I(t)S(t)
qS (t) = argmaxq f (q) − CqqS (t)β ·
and qR (t) = argmaxq f (q).
S(t) + I(t)
Because f 0 (0) > 0, both the equilibrium actions qS (t) and qR (t) are positive for all t. The
equilibrium action qR (t) is a constant depending on f . The equilibrium action q(t) = qS (t) of
susceptible and infected individuals may not have an analytic solution, but is characterized
15

We assume that flow payoffs do not depend on others’ economic activity, but could also allow strategic
spillovers as in Section 6.1. The high infection risk condition would then have an additional term depending
on the cross partial derivative of f in an individual’s own action and the average action. We describe the
two generalizations separately for simplicity.

The high infection risk condition is now:
Definition 6. There is high infection risk at time t if
Cβ ·

I(t)S(t)
> −f 00 (q(t)).
S(t) + I(t)

(12)

Because f is strictly concave, the right-hand side is positive. The high infection risk
condition is more likely to hold when the elasticity of the activity level −f 00 (q(t)) is smaller,
i.e., payoffs are more concave in activity levels. In this case individuals will react more to
changes in risk levels by increasing or decreasing social distancing.
Our risk compensation results continue to hold:
Proposition 300 . Suppose I(t) < S(t). Then

∂ιx (t)
(0)
∂x

< 0 if and only if there is high infection

risk at time t.
Proposition 400 . The following are equivalent:
(1) There is high infection risk at time t,
(2) Marginally decreasing β at time t increases ι(t), and
(3) Marginally decreasing C at time t increases Cι(t).
A simple example which nests the quadratic functional form is
f (qi (t)) = qi (t) − aqi (t)α ,
where α > 1. Then the elasticity of activity levels with respect to infection risk is equal
to aα(α − 1)q α−2 . This elasticity is decreasing in Cβ ·

when α > 2. When α is large, behavioral responses to policies are most

important at times when there is more social distancing already happening; when α is small
this need not be the case.
27

In Appendix C, we repeat the calibration exercise from Section 4.3 with α =

3
2

and α = 3.

We find that behavioral responses to changes in risk levels are more important when α is
larger, and are more important near the peak of an outbreak for each of the values for α.

6.3

Forward-Looking Agents

Our analysis until now has assumed all levels of activity are chosen myopically. We now
show that the basic logic behind our results extends to forward-looking agents.
We assume all individuals have discount rate r > 0. To maintain consistency between
the myopic model and the limit case r = ∞, we assume that an individual pays infection
cost C upon transitioning from the susceptible state to the infected state.
The continuation payoff at time t0 for an individual i choosing activity levels qi (t) who
becomes infected at time t1 ≥ t0 is
Z

∞

e−r(t−t0 ) (qi (t) − aqi (t)2 )dt − Ce−r(t1 −t0 ) .

while the continuation payoff at time t0 for an individual i choosing activity levels qi (t) who
does not become infected at any time t1 ≥ t0 is
∞

Z

e−r(t−t0 ) (qi (t) − aqi (t)2 )dt.

t0

An equilibrium is a choice of activity levels qS (t) and qR (t) maximizing the expected continuation payoffs for individual i. Individuals therefore respond optimally to the future disease
path, which is common knowledge at equilibrium.
Fix an equilibrium and let πS (t), πI (t), and πR (t) be the expected continuation payoffs to
individuals in the susceptible, infected, and recovered states, respectively.16 The continuation
payoffs πI (t0 ) and πR (t0 ) at time t0 are equal to the conditional expectation of
Z

∞

e−r(t−t0 ) (qi (t) − aqi (t)2 )dt

16

In principle, an equilibrium need not exist and multiple equilibria are possible with forward-looking
agents (unlike in the myopic case, where there is a unique equilibrium). In numerical work on SIR models
with endogenous behavior, existence and multiplicity of equilibrium have not been concerns.

28

given the disease state at time t0 , while πS (t0 ) also includes the expected discounted infection
cost for an individual who is susceptible at time t0 .
e
We define C(t)
= C + (πI (t) − πS (t)) to be the change in payoffs from infection. This
is an endogenous object depending on future equilibrium actions and the future likelihood
of infection, as well as the infection cost. The equilibrium activity level at each time t then
satisfies
q(t) =

2a + C(t)β
·

S(t)I(t)

.

(13)

Infection continues to carry a direct cost due to health impacts, but also saves the infected
individual from the possibility of future infection. An individual who has been infected and
is now immune can interact more without consequence.
e
We first prove several properties of the change in continuation payoffs from infection C(t).
e
The bounds we now show can be used to reformulate subsequent results involving C(t)
in
terms of the population disease state and exogenous parameters. Let R(∞) be the fraction
of the population eventually infected if q(t) = q for all t, i.e., in the standard SIR model
with no behavioral response.
Proposition 8. Suppose the initial prevalence is I(0) > 0. The continuation payoffs from


e < C for all t,
infection satisfy: (i) 1 − R(∞)−R(t)
C < C(t)
1−R(t)
e = C, and
(ii) limt→∞ C(t)
e
= C.
(iii) limI(0)→0 C(0)
e
Part (i) of the proposition gives bounds on C(t).
The continuation payoffs of infected
individuals are always higher than the continuation payoffs of susceptible individuals, so
e
e
C(t)
< C. The lower bound on C(t)
is derived by comparing the continuation payoffs at
equilibrium to the continuation payoffs if there were no social distancing. The lower bound
is expressed in terms on the current recovered population R(t) and R(∞), which can be
computed in the standard SIR model.
Part (ii) says that late in the outbreak, most infections and social distancing have already
occurred and so the direct infection costs dominate. Part (iii) says that the initial prevalence
is very small, direct infection costs also dominate at the beginning of the outbreak. More

29

e
generally, whether C(t)
is large early in the outbreak will depend on the initial prevalence
and the discount rate.
We next formulate our risk compensation results with forward looking agents. We study
the impact of a temporary shock at time t, with the relevant parameter reverting at all times
after t. For example, an unexpected change in temperature could create a brief temporary
shock to the transmission rate. We assume that behavior continues to satisfy equation (13)
and that the equilibrium selection at times after t is not affected by the shock.
The definition of high infection risk now replaces the infection cost C replaced by the
e
endogenous cost C.
Definition 7. There is high infection risk at time t if
S(t)I(t)
e
C(t)β
·
> 2a.
I(t) + S(t)
As in the myopic model, the left-hand side is larger when the susceptible and infected
e
populations are larger. There is now an additional force, as C(t)
is larger when there is
less equilibrium social distancing and a lower likelihood of infection in the near future (see
Proposition 8).
The risk compensation results extend from the myopic case:
Proposition 3000 . Suppose I(t) < S(t). Then

∂ιx (t)
(0)
∂x

< 0 if and only if there is high

infection risk at time t.
Proposition 4000 . The following are equivalent:
(1) There is high infection risk at time t,
(2) Marginally decreasing β at time t increases ι(t), and
e
(3) Marginally decreasing C at time t increases C(t)ι(t).
S(t)I(t)
e
now captures
The basic logic is the same as in the myopic case. The term C(t)β
· I(t)+S(t)

the behavioral response to a temporary change. The assumption of an instantaneous shock
e
that does not affect future play ensures that C(t)
is unchanged. A lasting change, such as
30

e by altering the continuation
requiring masks for a fixed period of time, would also change C(t)
payoffs for susceptible and infected individuals. This would introduce an additional term
e
involving the derivative of C(t).
e
The high infection risk condition in the two propositions includes the term C(t),
which
depends on the future equilibrium path. The bounds in Proposition 8 imply a necessary
condition for high infection risk in terms of the population disease state and exogenous
parameters.

Proofs

Proof of Proposition 1. We first show that I(t) → 0. If not, we could choose  > 0 and a
sequence t1 , t2 , . . . such that ti+1 > ti + 1 and I(ti ) > . Because infected individuals recover
at a Poisson rate κ, there exists δ > 0 such that if I(t) > , at least δ individuals recover in
the time interval [t, t + 1]. Thus at least δ individuals recover in period [ti , ti + 1] for each i,
which gives a contradiction since there is a unit mass of individuals who can recover at most
once each.
Since R(t) is increasing, we can define R(∞) = limt→∞ R(t). We next show that this
limit R(∞) ∈ (0, 1). Because I(0) > 0 and infected individuals recover at a Poisson rate,
R(∞) > 0.
Suppose that R(∞) = 1, so that S(t) → 0. Because q(t) ≤ q for all t, we can bound
R(∞) above by the limit of R(t) when all individuals choose activity q(t) = q for all t:
Lemma 1. Let R(t) be the share of recovered individuals when all individuals choose level
of activity q for all t. Then R(∞) ≤ R(∞).
Proof. Define an infection chain i0 , . . . , ik of length k to be a sequence of k individuals such
that i0 is infected at time zero and for each 0 ≤ j < k, individual ij meets individual ij+1
while individual ij is infected. Then R(∞) is equal to the share of invidiuals who are in an
infection chain of length k for any k. So it is sufficient to show that the number of individuals
in infection chain of length k for any k is weakly higher under level of activity q at all times
compared to q(t).

34

We claim that for each k, the share of individuals in infection chains of length at most k
is weakly higher under actions q at all times compared to q(t). The proof of the claim is by
induction, and when k = 0 the share is I(0) in both cases.
Suppose the claim holds for k. An individual i who is not initially infected is in an
infection chain of length k + 1 if and only if i meets at least one individual in an infection
chain of length at most k while that individual is infected. By the inductive hypothesis,
there are weakly more individuals in an infection chain of length at most k under actions q
at all times compared to q(t). As meetings are independent, the probability of meeting any
such individual is increasing in qi (t) and qI (t) for all t. So the probability that i is in an
infection chain of length k + 1 is weakly higher under actions q at all times compared to q(t).
Therefore, the claim holds for k + 1. This completes the induction and therefore proves the
lemma.
By the lemma, we can assume for the remainder of the argument that q(t) = q for all t.
We then have infection rate S(t)I(t)q 2 β and recovery rate κI(t).

by the first inequality and I(t)
≤ − κ2 I(t) by the second inequality. In particular, I(t)
exponentially decays at a faster rate than S(t). Since S(t0 ) and I(t0 ) are positive, this
proves the claim.
Therefore, we can choose t0 such that S(t) > I(t) for all t ≥ t0 and S(t)q 2 β <

t ≥ t0 . Given an individual i who is infected at time t ≥ t0 , the second inequality implies
that the expected number of susceptible individuals whom i infects is less than 12 . Therefore,

This contradicts our assumption that S(t) → 0, so we must have R(∞) < 1.
Proof of Proposition 2. We first show that I(t) is initially increasing for I(0) small. We then
˙ = 0, we have I(t)
˙ ≤ 0 at all subsequent times until t∗ . To do so we show
show that once I(t)

that whenever I(t)

Note that the population shares (S(t), I(t), R(t)) and the equilibrium level of activity
˙ is continuous as well.
q(t) are continuous in time, so I(t)
˙
We first show that for I(0) sufficiently small, I(0)
> 0. By Assumption 1 (high enough
transmissivity), q 2 β > κ. Because q(0) is a continuous function of (S(t), I(t), R(t)) with
q(0) = q when I(t) = 0, it follows that
(1 − I(0))q(0)2 β > κ

for I(0) > 0 sufficiently small. Since I(0)
= I(0)(1 − I(0))q(0)2 β − I(0)κ, the prevalence is
initially increasing for I(0) sufficiently small.

Proof of Corollary 1. We treat the two cases of Cβ small and Cβ large separately.
Cβ small: By the proof of Proposition 2, I(t) is single-peaked if I(0) is sufficiently small
and

S(t)I(t)
We claim the expression − (S(t)+I(t))
2 is bounded below by a constant M independent of

C and β (but potentially depending on a and κ). Indeed, S(t)I(t) is bounded above by one.
The expression S(t) + I(t) is bounded below by the value of 1 − R(∞) when β = 1 and
C = 0, so that q(t) = q for all t (Lemma 1). Since 1 − R(∞) > 0 by Proposition 1, this
proves the claim.
We conclude that whenever Cβ <

2a

M

the prevalence I(t) is single-peaked for I(0) suffi-

ciently small.
Cβ large: We next consider Cβ large, and will show that for any Cβ sufficiently large,
we have I(t) < S(t) for all t when I(0) is small enough. As above, we can bound 1 − R(∞)
below by a positive constant, which we call N .
Let δ < N/2. We will show that for Cβ sufficiently large and I(0) < δ/2, we have I(t) < δ

for all t. If not, there must exist some time t0 at which δ/2 < I(t0 ) < δ and I(t
Since I(t0 ) + S(t0 ) ≥ N , I(t0 ) < δ, and δ < N/2, we have S(t0 ) > I(t0 ). Therefore,

But this contradicts our assumption that I(t
We have shown I(t) < δ for all t. Since I(t) + S(t) ≥ N > 2δ for all t, we must have
I(t) < S(t) for all t as desired. We now apply Proposition 2.
The proofs of Propositions 3 and 4 are special cases of the proofs of Propositions 30 and 40
and Propositions 300 and 400 , which we provide below.
Proof of Proposition 5. Suppose types in A choose qk (t) > 0 at equilibrium while the remaining types choose qk (t) = 0. For each type k who chooses qk (t) > 0, we have a first-order
condition

, we can rewrite the previous equation as

(MA + 2 · diag(ak )) (qk (t))k∈A = 1.

(14)

This gives the desired expression for equilibrium behavior.
To complete the proof, we must show that A = Am . At least one entry of (MA + 2aI)−1 1
must be positive for each A. Therefore, at most m − 1 types can be removed from some Aj
with 1 ≤ j ≤ m − 1, so we must have Aj = Aj+1 beginning with some 1 ≤ j ≤ m.
The solution to equation (14) for each A can be seen as the equilibrium of a game for
types in A in which levels of activity can be negative and payoffs for each type k are

The best response for any individual i at time t is decreasing in

Each time

we pass from Aj to Aj+1 , we increase the actions qk (t) of all types choosing negative levels of
activity according to equation (14) to zero. When the actions of these types are increased to
P
zero, other types will decrease their activity levels. However m
k=1 Ik (t)qk (t) cannot be lower
at equilibrium under Aj+1 than Aj (because then all types would choose higher activity levels
P
under Aj+1 than Aj , which would increase m
k=1 Ik (t)qk (t)). Therefore any type choosing
zero activity level under Aj for j < m will also choose zero activity level under Am .
38

The same logic shows that the equilibrium is unique: because the best responses of all
P
types are decreasing in m
k=1 Ik (t)qk (t), there is a unique fixed point.
Proof of Proposition 6. We first prove the characterization of when individuals of type 2

Next, we show that I1 (t1 ) > I1 (t2 ) whenever type 2 stops choosing positive activity at
time t1 and resumes at time t2 . Suppose not, so that I1 (t1 ) ≤ I1 (t2 ).
We have
C2 βq1 (t)I1 (t) ·

as a positive fraction of infected

type 2 individuals recover while no new type 2 individuals are infected during the interval [t1 , t2 ]. Therefore, we must have q1 (t1 )I1 (t1 ) > q1 (t2 )I1 (t2 ). Since I1 (t1 ) ≤ I1 (t2 ) while
S1 (t1 ) > S1 (t2 ), we have

S1 (t1 )

I1 (t2 )+S1 (t2 )

Since q1 (t)I1 (t) decreases and the proba-

bility of a type 1 individual being susceptible decreases from t1 to t2 , we have q1 (t1 ) < q1 (t2 ).
We have shown that if I1 (t1 ) ≤ I1 (t2 ), then q1 (t1 ) < q1 (t2 ) but q1 (t1 )I1 (t1 ) > q1 (t2 )I1 (t2 ).
This gives a contradiction.

so that β R q 2 < κ. Suppose I(ti ) > 

such that whenever I(ti ) > , we must have I(t) > /2 for all t ∈ [ti , ti + δ]. We can choose
q > 0 such that all individuals choose q(t) > q at all times. The probability any susceptible
individual is infected in [ti , ti + δ] is therefore bounded below by some positive constant, so
the claim S(t) → 0 holds.
Each recovered individual is infected at rate at most β R q 2 I(t). Thus, the infection rate

I(t) ≤ . Therefore we must have I(t) >  for all t as long as I(0) >  (which we can assume
by shrinking  if necessary). This shows lim inf t I(t) > 0.

e < C for all t. Recall C(t)
e = C − πS (t) + πI (t),
Proof of Proposition 8. (i) We first show C(t)
where πS (t) and πI (t) are the equilibrium continuation payoffs for infected and susceptible
individuals. We must show that πI (t) > πS (t).
Susceptible and infected individuals choose action q(t) < q while recovered individuals
choose action q. The time at which an individual who is susceptible at time t recovers
(which may be ∞) first-order stochastically dominates the time at which an individual who
is infected at time t recovers. Therefore, the expected flow payoffs from activity are higher
for an infected individual than a susceptible individual. Since only susceptible individuals
may pay the infection cost C, we conclude πI (t) > πS (t).
We next show that (1 −

R(∞)−R(t0 )

≤ C(t).
Recall R(∞) is the share of individuals

who are eventually infected when q(t) = q for all t.
Consider an individual i who is susceptible at time t0 . We claim that if i chose qi (t) = q
for all t ≥ t0 , then the probability that i is infected at any time t ≥ t0 is at most R(∞)−R(t).
By Lemma 1, the number of individuals are infected at any time t ≥ t0 is at most
43

R(∞) − R(t) given any actions q(t) ≤ q. Moreover, the number of individuals are infected
at any time t ≥ t0 is maximized (conditional on actions before time t0 ) when q(t) = q for
all t ≥ t0 . Since increasing the activity level q(t) chosen by others increases the probability
that any given infected individual will infect i, this implies the claim.
Now, consider an individual i who is either susceptible (with probability

or

at time t0 . Individual i could deviate to choose the same

distribution of actions as an individual who is infected at time t0 . To do so, individual i
initially follows the equilibrium but then transitions to choosing activity level q(t) = q at
Poisson rate κ.
This deviation would increase the continuation payoffs for i conditional on being infected
at time t0 , and therefore must decrease the continuation payoffs for i conditional on being
susceptible at time t0 . If individual i is not already infected, then i would pay the infection

(ii) We want to bound πI (t) − πS (t) for t large. This gap consists of the difference in flow
payoffs from economic activity and the potential infection cost.
e
We have I(t) → 0 as in the myopic case. By part (i) of the proposition, C(t)
≤ C for
all C. So by equation (13), we have q(t) → ∞ as t → ∞. Therefore the gap between flow
payoffs from economic activity vanishes as t → ∞.
The probability of infection at some time after t is R(∞) − R(t), and this probability
converges to zero as t → ∞ since R(t) is increasing. So the potential infection cost for
susceptible individuals vanishes as t → ∞. We conclude that πI (t) − πS (t) → 0.
(iii) Let  > 0. We claim that πI (0) − πS (0) <  for I(0) sufficiently small. Given a
discount rate r, we can choose t0 large enough so that for any I(0) the contribution to πI (0)
from payoffs at time t ≥ t0 is at most /3.
We can then choose I(0) small enough so that C(I(t0 ) + R(t0 )) ≤ /3. To see this, note
that I(t0 ) + R(t0 ) is bounded above by its value when q(t) = q for all t.
44

Finally, by equation (13), we observe that max0≤t≤t0 q(t) → q as I(0) → 0. Therefore, we
conclude that the gap between flow payoffs from economic activity vanishes at times t ≤ t0
vanishes as I(0) → 0. So for I(0) sufficiently small, the total gap in flow payoffs at times
t ≤ t0 is at most /3. Combining these three inequalities, we conclude that πI (0) − πS (0) <
.

Risk Compensation with Arbitrary Spillovers

Section 6.1 showed that strategic complementarities amplify behavioral responses while
strategic substitutes weaken behavioral responses. With a heterogeneous population, there
may be positive spillovers between some individuals and negative spillovers between others.
The current section gives a condition determining how the infection rate responds to changes
in disease risk under arbitrary spillovers.
Consider a model with types 1, . . . , m, where the payoffs to an individual i of type k are

in Section 5.1, we define the matrix MA = (Ck β ·

Sk (t)Ik0 (t)

Sk (t)+Ik (t) k,k ∈A

Let BA = (bkk0 )k,k0 ∈A be

the matrix of spillovers.
The first-order condition gives (qk (t))k∈A = (MA + 2 · diag(ak ) − BA )−1 1. We will refer to
the matrix inverse in this expression as NA = (MA + 2 · diag(ak ) − BA )−1 . The total infection
rate is

where A is the set of types choosing positive activity levels at time t.
Comparative statics in prevalence now depend on the types of the newly infected individuals. For each x, we define (Skx (t), Ikx (t), Rkx (t)) = (Sk (t) −

That is,

we distribute new infections across types so that the number of new infections within each
type is proportional to the current prevalence of infections within in that type. We define
ιx (t) and qkx (t) to be the corresponding infection rate and activity levels.
Increasing prevalence in this way increases the infection rate if and only if there is high
infection risk:

Since qk (t) = (NA 1)k , this expression is equal to the left-hand side of the high infection risk
condition.
The equivalence between the high infection risk condition and comparative statics in β
and C is the same as in the baseline model:
Proposition 40000 . The following are equivalent:
(1) There is high infection risk at time t,
(2) Marginally increasing β at time t decreases ι(t), and
e
(3) Marginally increasing C at time t decreases C(t)ι(t).

Calibrations with General Payoffs

In this section, we repeat the calibration exercise from Section 4.3 with more general payoffs.
We take the flow payoffs from economic activity to be q − aq α for α > 1. Section 6 showed

Figures 5 and 6 conduct simulations for α = 1.5 and α = 3. As in Section 4.3, we consider
baseline reproductive numbers R0mod = 2.4 and R0high = 5.7 with average contagious period
of 14 days and infection cost equal to the value of six months of normal activity. Each figure
I(t)S(t)
shows the prevalence I(t) in dashed blue and Cβ · S(t)+I(t)

high infection risk condition holds when the solid red curve is positive.
A higher value of α leads to stronger behavioral responses. When α = 23 , the high infection
risk condition does not hold for R0mod or R0high , so the direct effects of policy changes will be
larger than behavioral responses. The condition does come close to holding near the peak
with reproductive number R0high , however.
When α = 3, the the high infection risk condition does hold for both R0mod and R0high .
With reproductive number R0mod , the solid red curve’s maximum is about 0.1, suggesting
that behavioral responses to policy changes are barely larger than direct effects. With
reproductive number R0mod , behavioral responses are substantially larger than direct effects
for more than a year.
