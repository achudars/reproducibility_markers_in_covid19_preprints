The infections and fatalities due to SARS-CoV-2 virus for cases specific to India have been studied
using a deterministic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-dead (SEIRD) compartmental model.
One of the most significant epidemiological parameter, namely the effective reproduction number of
the infection is extracted from the daily growth rate data of reported infections and it is included
in the model with a time variation. We evaluate the effect of control interventions implemented till
now and estimate the case numbers for infections and deaths averted by these restrictive measures.
We further provide a forecast on the extent of the future Covid-19 transmission in India and predict
the probable numbers of infections and fatalities under various potential scenarios.

INTRODUCTION

Almost every continent of the planet is grappling with
a large number of infections arising due to virus called
Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2 [1]. These infections that
may result in a mild to severe symptomatic disease called
Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 were first detected in Wuhan, a city in central China [2, 3]. Later
the infections spread across the globe and it has forced
nations to undertake drastic measures to minimize the
loss of precious human lives [4, 5]. For a populous country like India, which has a dense and large population (â‰ˆ
1.4 billion), the cause of concern is quite high. Therefore, it is of special importance to study the spread of
COVID-19 in India, and make reliable predictions which
can help in mitigation of its ensuing effects. These timely
critical information may be crucial for devising strategies
for containment of infections and estimating the requirements of medical facilities.
In India an early complete nation-wide lock-down was
imposed from 25th March when the number of cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections were around 650. These
strict measures prevented any large scale disaster and
slowed down the rate of infections in the initial stages
and helped in geographical containment of the epidemic.
However, recent days have seen no real decrease perhaps
due to gradual weakening of restrictive measures owing
to pragmatic social and economic reasons. From June
1st India continues to have a complete lock-down only in
the defined containment zones where the infection rates
are high. These steps of gradual easing of lock-down
have been necessitated as the balance between life and
livelihoods are intertwined, which calls for invoking more
intelligent strategies because a complete extended lockdown cannot be sustained for very long time without
other competing collateral losses to the most vulnerable
sections of society. Alternative steps based on isolation of
infected patients through the lock-down in the containment zones and more widespread testing and contacttracing are being followed for controlling the rate of infection. This represents the transition from suppression
to mitigation strategy for the resolution of any potential
outbreak but efficacy of these steps remains to be seen as

the execution of these policies on ground level are challenging.
The transmission dynamics of viral epidemics in any
population is an interplay of various factors related to
viral, immunologic, environmental and sociological conditions. A number of mathematical and physical models
have been proposed in general to understand the evolution of epidemics, aiming to make reliable predictions
so that to help governments to formulate proper policies
and response plans for effective control of the disease [6â€“
8]. Simple deterministic mathematical models based on
the formulation of differential equations have been extensively used to provide information on the transmission
mechanism of various viral epidemics. The SIR model
is a one of the simplest epidemiological models that is
based on dividing the population among three compartments, the susceptible, the infected and the recovered (or
deceased) populations and determining their time evolution [9]. The SEIR [10] model is a simple extension of the
SIR model, where an additional compartment of exposed
population with a latency period is introduced which is
more appropriate for COVID-19 like epidemic which has
an inherent latency and asymptomatic transmission [11].
Extended models have been employed that use several
separate compartments for various sub-populations such
as, asymptomatic, quarantined, hospitalized or components based on the variations for example, according to
age, gender etc. [12, 13]. However, this entails incorporation of many unknown parameters and uncertain initial conditions about which the information is either not
available or there are large associated uncertainties.
In the present article, we employ a dynamic SEIRD
model with the inclusion of population of deaths as a
separate compartment in the SEIR model. Several works
have been already performed in the Indian context to explain the COVID-19 dynamics in the initial phase of its
transmission [14â€“18]. We incorporate the crucial parameter of contact period with a time variation connecting
its value at the beginning of the epidemic to the current
reduced value. The reduction in the values of contact
rate has been achieved due to many isolation measures,
primarily the imposed nation-wide lock-down. The time
variation in the contact rate Î²(t) is determined through

2
the effective reproduction number R(t) that is in turn related to the doubling time of the rate of infection growth
[19â€“21]. We integrate this parameter in the SEIRD model
calculations and estimate the role of interventions in preventing the number of probable infections and death till
now. Further, we consider different potential scenarios
for the rate of growth of infections for making projections
of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We make a forecast for the
probable numbers of infections and fatalities in the coming times. The projections provide information for the
extent of suppression and containment strategies that
need to be employed to mitigate the impact of Covid19 in coming times. It is to be mentioned that results
obtained in this work are to be used for the research purposes only.
SEIRD MODEL AND EFFECTIVE
REPRODUCTION NUMBER

The data for the present studies are collected from the repository hosted at website
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus [22] for
cases specific to India. The epidemiology of the COVID19 outbreak using a deterministic SEIRD model is
studied with five compartments governed by a set of
ordinary differential equations

where, S(t) is the susceptible population, E(t) is the exposed population, I(t) is the infectious population, R(t)
is the recovered population and D(t) is the number of
deaths at any instant t and N = S + E + I + R + D
is the total population. We have not included separate
compartments for the number of asymptomatic, quarantined, hospitalized populations or the variations according to age or gender, as these lead to increase in number
of unknown parameters and therefore lead to large uncertainties in the predictions. In any case, these numbers
can be estimated in an average way with their relations
to populations that have been considered. In addition,
assumption about the no re-infection of the recovered
population is made as there is no evidence to the contrary.
The parameters of the above set of equations are the
latent period of being exposed A = 1/Ï† that is related
to the incubation period of the virus, the contact period
B of infection = 1/Î², the period of being free from being
infected G = 1/Î³ commonly known as the recovery time ,

the parameter corresponding to death D = 1/Î´ of the infected population. These parameters determine the transitions that occur across the compartments as the time
evolves. Here, the parameters A, G and D are specific
to characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and only weakly correlated to the health responses of the country and therefore
expected to have similar values across countries. The parameter B represents the strength (speed) of the virus
transmission which is intimately related to the prevailing
conditions of containment measures undertaken by specific countries. Apart from these parameters, the fraction
of the susceptible population at the beginning to the total
population Î± = S(0)/N is a very important parameter.
Taking total population of the region as S(0) may lead to
gross overestimation of case numbers, because the part
of population may be inherently immune or less affected
by the virus or live in isolated conditions. Furthermore,
the extent of initial exposed latent population defined
by  = E(0)/I(0), parameter, may also be an important
parameter that indicates the presence of a number of
undetected or asymptomatic exposed individuals at the
beginning.
One of the most significant parameters that describes
the pandemic is the basic reproduction number of infection R0 , which is defined as the number of individuals
that are infected from the uninfected, susceptible population by one infected individual under normal conditions [6, 19]. There are challenges in determining R0 in
terms of the parameters of deterministic model as one
requires estimates of included parameters that are uncertain [23]. During the spread of the epidemic one can
define an effective reproduction number Ri (t), which is
a time dependent quantity that changes because of control measures and depletion of susceptible population.
It provides the dynamic information on the strength of
the epidemic transmission as the time evolves. In general, the infection continues to expand if Ri (t) has values
greater than 1, while the epidemic stops eventually if
Ri (t) is persistently less than 1. The estimation of the
effective reproduction number is complicated and many
models have been proposed for its determination [24, 25]
from the data. Here we use a simple method based on
fitting the incidence data growth rate by a distribution
with gaussian shape to determine the behaviour of Ri (t).
It must be mentioned however, that reported data has
an inherent delay as compared to the instantaneous population numbers that are required for the estimation of
its actual value. In the SIR - type models or their simple extensions, such as one described above Ri (t) can be
expressed as

Ri (t) =

Î².S(t)
(Î³ + Î´).N

(2)

In the initial stages of the infection, S(t) âˆ¼ N and Ri = Î²Î³
, since (Î³  Î´). The Ri (t) value can be estimated using
the initial doubling time Td of the number of infections

where a, b, Ïƒ and t0 are fit parameters. These parameters are determined from the best fit approach through
the local minimization of the sum of squares of the error.
The resulting fit to the daily growth rate is shown in Fig.
1a along with the band with standard error on fit parameters. In addition, the projections for next days after
28th May are also shown for various probable scenarios
by the straight lines that are used for the extrapolations
of infection growth rate. It is seen from the figure that
India had a peak daily growth rate of âˆ¼ 20 % at the
beginning of the epidemic which reduced to âˆ¼ 5 % after
one month of imposition of lock-down. It is to be noted
that the nationwide lock-down imposed on 25th March
has been continually relaxed in phased manner and exists
now only in the containment zones from 1st June. However, after the decrease in growth rate in infections in the
initial phase following the lock-down, the cases of infection have continued to grow at somewhat constant rate
for a while. The extrapolations for next 30 days that
define various probable scenarios are approximated as a
linear reduction or increase from the present value of infection growth rate. The quantity r(t) determined from
the data is also used to study the evolution of Ri (t) in
time as shown in Fig. 1b. It must be noted that Ri (t) also
depends on the period of infection for which, we present
the result for values G = 12.7 days and G = 20 days. The
Ri (t) values have been extracted from the r(t) of the reported cases and also obtained through fitted value of
r(t). These values are seen to decrease from a peak value
of âˆ¼ 4 to a value of âˆ¼ 1.6 for G = 12.7 days, which is
still substantially higher than the value 1 that is required
for the spontaneous disappearance of the infection. The
Td (t) value that is directly extracted from the data and
also from the fit shows a constant value of âˆ¼ 16 days.

Cases

The SEIRD model calculations using eqn. 1 have been
performed to make comparisons with the data aggregated
for India using the reported cases of infected, recovered
and dead populations up to 28th May and to make forecasts about the future scenarios. The contact rate parameter Î²(t) is taken to be time dependent with the parameters Î²0 and Î²0c fixed in accordance of equation 6.
The parameter A is taken as 5.1 days, which is the mean
incubation period and bit larger than the latency period.
The value of parameter Î´ = 0.025 is taken, which determines the death population and very weakly affects
populations in other compartments. The parameter Î³(t)
is taken in the following form

Cases

The time variation in this parameter with Î³0 = 0.079 corresponding to period of 12.7 days and Îº=0.01 takes into
account the larger value of G â‰ˆ 26 days that is needed to
explain the behaviour of data in the initial stages. As the
time elapses, a reduction in the recovery period is seen
and Î³ approaches Î³0 value.
The model was applied from the day of the epidemic
when cumulative number of infections were âˆ¼ 100 as on
14th March. The fraction of the population at day 1 in
compartments are set as follows : I = 88/1.4e7, R =
10/1.4e7 and D = 2/1.4e7 as provided by the reported
data. Other initial conditions, defined by Î± and  are the
unknowns in the model. We take Î±=0.1 which is similar
to value of Î±=0.08 extracted for European countries in
Ref. [26]. The parameter  = 3.2A, is important for the
initial description of data but it does not affect long time
dynamics of the epidemic as predicted by the model.
The results of calculations with these parameters that
use the time varying Î²(t) parameter as determined above
provide a good description of the evolution in the case
numbers of reported infected, recovered and death population as shown in Fig. 2a. In addition, the calculations
have also been performed for constant Î² = 0.167 value,
which is obtained from the best fit to the exponential
distribution according to Eqn. 4. While the model results as shown in Fig. 2b provide a good description in
initial days, it grossly over-predicts the case numbers as
compared to the reported cases. It is quite evident from
the figure that the time dependence of Î²(t) is necessary
to understand the dynamics of infection spread for cases
in India.
The period of infection related to the recovery time of
the infected individuals is also taken with a time variation. This parameter is primarily the characteristic of
the epidemic and it is only mildly dependent on the responses of the health-care systems. In absence of any
effective therapy or cure that may shorten the length of
the infection it is relatively well known and it is taken as
âˆ¼ 12.7 days. However, larger value is required to explain
the reported data both with constant Î²-value [17] or even
when time variation in Î²-value is taken into account as

it has been found in the present study. The recovery
rates are continually improving, a feature also reflected
in the reported recovery data. Therefore, a time dependence in the parameter Î³(t) is introduced to account for
this observation. We show the calculations in Fig. 3 with
the different values of infection period as parameter with
constant values ( G = 5 day, 8 day, 12.7 day, 20 day and
27 day). As expected the shorter infection periods lead
to smaller peak values and faster disappearance of the
infected populations. The results presented here show
that the reduction in the infection period may by 3 days
reduce the infections by half assuming a completely nonisolated clinical intervention for all infected individuals.
To study the role of interventions we perform calculations with different values for the contact rate Î². The
interventions have led to a decrease in the daily growth
rate of infections which is intimately related to the Î²
value. We use the constant values of Î² = 0.252 and 0.125,
which correspond to the peak rate of growth and half its

value. The peak Î²-rate is expected to have prevailed
in the early stages of infection spread in the absence of
any interventions such as, the lock-down or the conditions of no enhanced public awareness. In addition, we
also give results obtained from the Î² = 0.167, Î² = 0.01
and time varying Î²-value. The infected, recovered and
death populations for these Î²-values are shown in Fig.
4a, Fig. 4b and Fig. 4c, respectively. From the comparison it is evident that the lock-down and other interventions have prevented any large spread of infections
and kept the death numbers particularly low. These interventions could have prevented around 4 million peak
infections and 200,000 deaths at the 100 day mark. The
lower growth rate also means that number of active infections are low at any instant which helps to optimize the
response of health care systems. The rate of infections
in India have remained approximately constant after the
initial reduction for last several days. After an extended
lock-down slowly the restrictions have been loosened up.
We extrapolate values of Î²(t) to predict the outcomes of
various probable scenarios. The Î²(t) values corresponding to growth rate value rpr as on 28th May are varied
so as to attain a given value at the end of next 30 days
assuming a time variation with constant slope. These
scenarios are named as the best case, the optimistic case,
the most likely, current, problematic and alarming scenarios respectively. The time evolution of the epidemic
is studied with these time variations for the future. The
resulting predictions for the populations of infected, recovered and dead are shown in Fig. 5a, Fig. 5b and Fig.
5c respectively. The growth rate same as rpr may lead
to a high number of total infections (âˆ¼ 8 million) with
fatalities in excess of 300,000. In the scenario that we
term as the most likely scenario, we can have a total of
3.5 million infected cases with almost 140,000 fatalities
over the course of pandemic. This will correspond to a

peak of 450,000 active infections sometime in the month
of September. These numbers can be reduced if with
containment measures the rate of growth can be brought
down drastically so that we can see an early resolution
of the pandemic approximately in 3-4 months time. In
this case, the death figures can be kept substantially low
in the range of 25,000-50,000. In contrast, if the rate of

growth were to increase from the present values due to
pre-mature lifting of the lock-down in the affected zones
and other lapses, the death numbers can be 500,000 with
a rather alarming number of infected individuals in short
time. Higher rates of growth also mean the large number of active infected cases appearing early and that may
stretch the health care systems to the brink.

We have made detailed comparison of model predictions with the real data using the important parameter
of contact rate and infection rate derived from the data itself from the first principles. It must be noted that there
is an inherent delay in the reported rate and instantaneous rate of the infection. In addition, the effect of any
restrictive measures undertaken appears with a delay in
the reported rate, which is estimated by the fit parameter
t0 âˆ¼ 15 days in the present case. The model calculations
are able to describe very well the case number of infected
and recovered populations of reported data till now. The
imposed restrictions have led to a reduction in the Ri (t)
and an increase in the Td values as the time elapses. The
quantitative measure of the intensity of the imposed lockdown that reduced the growth rate r(t) to almost half its
value is given by the fit parameter Ïƒ = 14 days. It is
seen from the calculations that a large number of infections and fatalities have been averted due to imposition
of the lock-down. Some part of this reduction may be
ascribed to the enhanced public awareness, and growing
disease monitoring and testing capabilities with the passage of time. However, effect of complete lock-down in
reducing the infection rate has been quite significant.
After the initial period of 40 days following the complete lock-down, there has not been much gain in the
reduction of infection spread rate in last 30 days. It is
probable that the gradual weakening of the lock-down
due to socio-economic reasons might have offset the gains
due to restrictive measures. Nevertheless, the continued
restrictions have prevented any rise in the rate of growth
of infections, which in absence of any such measures is
expected to rise again. Even the growth rate of âˆ¼ 4 âˆ’ 5%
attained so far implies an exponential growth and it is
seen that the epidemic in India is still in early stages.
Current estimates of future trends in new infections in
the weeks after 28th May suggest that more severe outbreak may occur in coming times leading to high number
of infections. With the estimates from the most likely
scenario, over 450,000 would be clinically diagnosed at
the maximum resulting in âˆ¼ 140,000 total fatalities.
Impact of the severity of the disease outbreak is quantified through the case fatality ratio (CFR). It is defined
as the ratio of fatality rate D(t) to the cumulative number of infections C(t). The CFR values have varied from
âˆ¼ 3.3 -2.8 as on April 15 to the present day which is less
than the global average of âˆ¼ 6.2. However, some doubts
remain about the estimations of CFR because it is possi-

ble that both the number of fatalities and infections may
be underestimated. It is more likely that C(t) may be
underestimated more due to the presence of large number of asymptomatic or non-critical infected cases which
leads to the overestimation of CFR, assuming reported
D(t) cases to be true. CFR remains low as long as the
health facilities are able to cope with the rate of patients

requiring critical care. In the scenarios if the number
of active infected cases is large as predicted by multiple
scenarios described above, requirements of hospitalizations and critical care resources may increase sharply.
In such a situation, the health care system is going to be
severely challenged in providing the critical care facilities
for prevention of fatalities. The CFR in these conditions
may rise to higher values. Therefore, imposing stricter
measures inside the containment zones and more extensive testing and contact-tracing seems to be only viable
logical preventive option that can lead to a manageable
reduction in infected cases and casualties in absence of
any therapies or large-scale immunity.

There are limitations of the simplistic model employed
here and therefore the exact quantitative numbers presented in the work are only indicative. In the present
model, the asymptomatic populations are taken only in
an indirect way at the start of the epidemic through the
introduction of the parameter . Inclusion of this population as a separate compartment however would lead
to introduction of extra set of unknown parameters. Further, we have not considered the regional and age specific
heterogeneities in the model. While we have made a reasonable assumption for the parameter Î± =0.1, implying
a 10% of the total population as the susceptible population, the overall numbers presented in this work may
differ if it has a significantly different value. This number
is going to be affected as the country has seen large scale
migration from the infected areas to the other areas in
recent times which may increase the pool of susceptible
population. Further, we have made forecasts in this work
based on probable daily growth rates. The determination
of contact rate parameter through the measured rate in
the simple way is uncertain due to stochastic fluctuations
in the early stages and inaccuracies and time delay of the
reported data. Further, there are challenges on designing
the control mechanisms based on the basis of the numbers of daily growth as discussed in Ref. [27]. However,
this work shows the operational use of the Ri (t) calculated from the instantaneous infection rate to provide a
reasonable description of the transmission dynamics.

CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we have presented results of SEIRD
model calculations to study the role of interventions and
make future projections in the Covid-19 spread in India. To make reliable forecast we have determined the
time dependent reproduction number Ri (t) and contact
rate parameter Î²(t) from the data for the daily rate of
increase of infections. It is shown that timely imposition of lock-down and other public health interventions
have led to a substantial reduction in the effective reproduction number which decreased to a present value
of â‰ˆ1.6 from the peak value of â‰ˆ3.2 corresponding to
an increase in the doubling time of the infections. Calculations performed using the time dependent contact
rate parameter Î²(t) in the SEIRD model provide a good
description of the case numbers of infections, recovered
and deaths. We further make the projections for different probable scenarios. In the most likely scenario the
model predicts a peak of active infections around the
month of September with significant number of fatalities
over the course of the epidemic around end of November.
The results show the impending critical challenges for
health care systems due to prospective high number of
people with infections. The salient feature of the simple
model employed in this work is the use of minimal uncertain parameters and therefore in our opinion it makes
reliable predictions of the infections and fatalities. The
projections of peak infections suggest big challenges for
the available critical care health facilities in the management of pandemic. New innovative solutions have to be
continuously found and intelligent measures have to be
effectively implemented if the Covid-19 infections have to
be contained with a moderate number and the ensuing
fatalities have to be minimized. The most important extension of this study will be to incorporate the regional
variability and apply this model by considering the state
wise infection data and make predictions accordingly.
