Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruption to economic and financial activity worldwide. We assess what happened to the aggregate U.S. stock market during
this period, including implications for both short and long-horizon investors. Using the
model of Maheu, McCurdy and Song (2012), we provide smoothed estimates and outof-sample forecasts associated with stock market dynamics during the pandemic. We
identify bull and bear market regimes including their bull correction and bear rally components, demonstrate the model’s performance in capturing periods of significant regime
change, and provide forecasts that improve risk management and investment decisions.
The paper concludes with out-of-sample forecasts of market states one year ahead.
Key Words: predictive density, long-horizon returns, Markov switching

Introduction

This paper dates and forecasts bull and bear markets for the COVID-19 pandemic period
based on aggregate equity return data from 1885-2020. Using the model of Maheu et al.
(2012) applied to weekly data from 1885-2020, we document where the market was and what
has happened to equity markets in 2020.
There are several reasons for using the restricted 4-state Markov-Switching (MS) model of
Maheu et al. (2012). First, unlike ex post dating methods (Pagan & Sossounov 2003, Lunde &
Timmermann 2004), it treats the market states as latent and provides probability estimates for
future states and regimes. This probability framework provides a full specification of the data
generating process. As such, it generates probability statements about the market dynamics
which are essential for investment and risk management decisions.
Secondly, in contrast to simple specifications which focus on two states of the market, our
model allows for four states including bull corrections and bear rallies. Conventional methods
of partitioning regimes do not identify intra-regime dynamics that can be very important for
forecasts and investment decisions. For example, if a rally (positive sub-trend) starts during
a bear regime, what is the probability that it will continue and transition to a bull market
regime as opposed to falling back to the bear market state? Will a bull market correction
(negative sub-trend) continue to a bear regime or recover to stay in the bull market regime?
Thirdly, higher-order moments of the state-specific distributions also provide useful information – for example, risk assessments associated with different states. They combine to
provide the aggregate mixture distribution that governs the market dynamics and the associated predictive mean and density forecasts that are key for decisions.
Finally, the parameters and states are identified with economic restrictions that are consistent with investors attitudes to market phases. The data supports these economically
motivated restrictions compared to an unrestricted 4-state model.
We find that the market moved from a bull state at the start of 2020 to a bull correction
and quickly to a bear market on February 26. This bear market dominated until June 3
when the market transitioned to a bear rally and has remained in this phase. This is in
contrast to the dating methods used in the popular press (“New bull market in stocks could
last three years and may produce another 30% in gains, veteran strategist says”, Aug 31, 2020,
https://www.marketwatch.com/). Those methods focus solely on price trends and ignore risk.
Our model classifies the recent market into the bear rally due to the larger variance in returns.
This elevated risk is not consistent with past bull market phases that display lower variability.
Traditional 2-regime models using ex post dating methods are unable to distinguish between bear rally and bull market states. Our approach does this, in part, due to probability
estimates of risk differences across those states. We show the dramatic impact that the
COVID-19 pandemic has had on the return distribution and risk measures. The model provides very accurate forecasts of turning points and these would have been available in real-time
to investors.
Given the benefits of a full probability model of stock market phases, it is natural ask
whether forecasts from this mixture-distribution model can improve investment and risk management decisions. To this end, we define a pseudo Sharpe ratio to characterize in-sample
estimates of the state density parameters. We then extend this measure to an out-of-sample
predictive Sharpe ratio, derived from the predictive density of returns which is sensitive to
the forecasted market states. This measure can be useful in assessing the risk and return of
entering the market.
Several market timing investments are explored. We show that simple timing rules di2

recting when to exit and enter the market lead to improved investment decisions relative to
a buy and hold strategy in 2020. These results are robust to different timing strategies and
are a result of the precise turning points our model identifies and forecasts. Each of these
market timing strategies are in real time and would have been available to an investor using
the model for forecasts.
The paper concludes with long-horizon forecasts of state probabilities one year ahead. If
the effects of COVID-19 were to disappear today, then our model predicts months, and not
weeks, till the stock market returns to normal times.
Our paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 briefly review the structure and
estimation of the Maheu et al. (2012) bull and bear market model; and Section 4 summarizes
the data. Section 5 reports the results for the pre and post COVID-19 periods. Notably,
Section 5.3 provides forecasts based on one-week-ahead predictive densities and out-of-sample
forecasts of future states and the associated risk and return measures. Section 5.4 reports
market timing strategies that exploit those forecasts. Long-horizon forecasts are discussed in
Section 5.5. Section 6 provides robustness results, comparing our model to competing models
from several perspectives. Section 7 concludes and an Appendix provides additional results
and model comparison details.

Model

Define log-returns as rt , t = 1, . . . , T and r1:t−1 = {r1 , . . . , rt−1 }. Consider the following 4-state
Markov-Switching (MS4) model from Maheu et al. (2012) for returns,
rt |st ∼ N (µst , σs2t )
pij = p(st = j|st−1 = i),

i = 1, ..., 4, j = 1, ..., 4.

in which si , i = 1, ..., 4, denote the latent states, parameterized as Normally distributed with
mean µsi and variance σs2i , and pi,j denote the state transition probabilities.
The following restrictions and labels are imposed for identification purposes,

No restriction is imposed on {σ12 , . . . , σ42 }. Note that there are four states but we refer to two
distinct regimes by Bt as
Bt = 1
Bt = 2

if
if

st = 1 or 2 (bear regime),
st = 3 or 4 (bull regime).

The transition matrix takes the following form.

P = 

This specification implies that bear states and bear rally states cannot move to a bull correction
and bull states and bull correction states cannot move to a bear rally state. This is done to
avoid confounding these states that display common mean trends up or down in prices. For
instance, it would be difficult to separate states 1 and 3 which both display negative average
growth. The restricted transition matrix also means that the start of a new regime must be
from a bear state or a bull state.
To further enforce economic restrictions on this model, the following long-run trends are
imposed on the model. Solving for the stationary distribution associated with P we can
compute the vector of unconditional state probabilities:
π = (A0 A)−1 A0 e

(2.1)

where A0 = [P 0 − I, ι] and e0 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] and ι = [1, 1, 1, 1]0 . The long-run restrictions are

Estimation

We perform posterior simulation with Gibbs sampling steps which reject any draws that violate
the parameter restrictions, coupled with the simulation smoother of Chib (1996) to sample the
latent state vector. Estimation follows exactly from Maheu et al. (2012) with the same priors
employed in our analyses. For the MCMC output simulation, consistent posterior moments
or predictive density quantities can be computed and are detailed in Maheu et al. (2012). We
collect 30, 000 posterior draws for inference after dropping an initial 5, 000 draws for burn-in.

Data

Daily equity capital gains for 1885 - 1927 are from Schwert (1990). Equity data from 1928 2020 use the S&P500 index daily adjusted close reported by Yahoo Finance (ĜSPC symbol).
Risk-free return data are from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. From these data, weekly
continuously compounded returns, scaled by 100, are obtained for 1885 - 2020. Weekly returns
are computed using Wednesday data and Thursday if Wednesday data is missing. The last
observation is November 25, 2020. In the following we refer to the equity index returns as
the S&P500 or the market. A matching weekly realized variance measure RVt , is computed
as the sum of intra-week daily squared returns. Summary statistics for the weekly data are
reported in Table 1.

Results

Full sample parameter estimates for the four states are found in Table 2. Those estimates
include posterior means and 0.95 probability density intervals for µi and σi associated with
each of the four states. Below those estimates, we report a pseudo Sharpe ratio, µi /σi , for each
state i for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. This measures the expected return adjusted for risk assuming a zero
risk-free rate for each state. The parameter estimates are broadly similar to those in Maheu
et al. (2012). The average return in the bear states, −0.94, is more negative than −0.11 in
4

the bull correction phases of the bull regimes. Analogously, the upward trend for returns in
bull states (0.52) is stronger than 0.23 in the bear rally phase of the bear regime. Combining
the return estimates with state volatilities, the Sharpe ratios also make sense, ranked from
highest to lowest in the bull, bear rally, bull correction and bear states respectively.
The posterior means of the state transition matrix P indicate persistence of bull and bear
regimes in that states within the bear regime (st = 1, 2) and those in the bull regime (st = 3, 4)
are likely to cluster together so that moves between regimes will be infrequent. Interestingly,
a bull correction state is much more likely (0.097) to transition back to the bull state than to
move to a bear state (0.013); whereas, a bear rally state is more likely (0.019) to transition to
the bull state than it is to fall back to a bear state (0.013). Furthermore, regime changes are
almost always transitions from a bear rally or from a bull correction. Directly jumping from
a bull state to a bear state or vice versa is very rare.
Table 3 reports the unconditional probabilities associated with the four states from which
one can compute the unconditional probabilities for the regimes. For example, the bull market
regime has a long-run probability of 0.672. Using the formulae in equation 2.2, one can
compute that the associated long-run mean of weekly returns in bull regimes as 0.186; whereas,
that for bear regimes is −0.069.

5.1

Before COVID-19

Figure 1 displays the cumulative log-return and realized volatility (top), the probability of a
bull regime P (Bt = 2 | r1:T ) (middle), and the probabilities of the 4 individual states (bottom)
during 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic. Very early in 2019, the market moved
from a bear rally state into the bull state. Throughout 2019 the model decisively identifies a
bull regime with fluctuations between the bull state and bull corrections.

5.2

After COVID-19

Figure 2 reports the same information as Figure 1 but for the year 2020 during which COVID19 erupted. The year began with strong evidence of a bull market, although with the probability of a bull correction building. The week of January 29 began a sequence of large negative
drops in the market leading to increasing evidence of a transition from a bull market to a bear
market. By February 26, the market had transitioned decisively from the bull correction state
to the bear market state. By April the probability of the bear market state declined until April
22 revealed a transition to a bear rally state. At the end of our estimation window (November
25, 2020), the probability of a bear rally state is still very high at 0.824. This is because, even
with a visible upward trend in the index since April, the market volatility is still too high and
variable to be consistent with a typical bull regime. This is evinced by the observation that
the weekly realized volatility (red line in the top panel) is variable, with spikes (for example,
during September and October 2020), and higher on average in comparison to its historical
average value 1.94 from Table 1.

5.3

Forecasts

Although one can date stock market cycles after the fact with smoothed probability estimates,
it is much more difficult to forecast changes out-of-sample. In this section, we report results
for which the model has been estimated at each point t using all past data 1, . . . , t to produce
a forecast of the state one week ahead t + 1.
5

Figure 3 uses these model forecasts of the state probabilities one week ahead to generate
out-of-sample regime forecasts. This figure compares the out-of-sample forecast of the market
regime probabilities with the full-sample (smoothed) probability estimates. It shows a relatively accurate week-by-week classification of regimes that was available in real-time to an
investor using the model to forecast stock market cycles.
One challenging period for the model forecasts was late August to early September. From
July to September the index displayed a strong positive trend, and the model forecasts allocated a nontrivial probability to a bull regime. In hindsight, this episode is precisely identified
as a bear regime using the smoothed estimates.
The breakdown of the regime forecasts into the constituent state forecasts one week ahead
in seen in Figure 4. Given this additional disaggregation, there is more deviation between the
state forecasts and smoothed estimates, but overall there is a strong correspondence between
the two. Note again that, with the exception of the July to September period, the forecasts
assign the highest probability to the bear rally state rather than a bull state.
The COVID-19 period has had an important impact on several features of the return
distribution. For example, Figure 5 displays the one-week-ahead predictive density generated
by the model. From the middle of March 2020 there was a dramatic impact that flattened the
return distribution for the rest of the year, along with more subtle changes in the location.
This implied a sharp increase in risk associated with holding the S&P500 portfolio.
Figure 6 illustrates the one-week-ahead predictive Sharpe ratios defined as √E(rt |r1:t−1 ) .
Var(rt |r1‘:t−1 )

The flattened density of returns in March is accompanied by a sudden drop of the predictive
Sharpe ratio. This ratio becomes positive in June and continues to improve over the summer
months until a decline in August. For the remainder of our sample, the predictive Sharpe
ratio never does attain the values at the start of 2020 before COVID-19 struck.
To illustrate another way, these changes in risk can be clearly seen from Value-at-Risk levels
estimated for our model and illustrated in Figure 7. The dashed Value-at-Risk levels obtained
from an assumption that returns are normally distributed would significantly understate risk
as compared to those levels implied by our model that incorporates a mixture of four state
distributions.

5.4

Market Timing

In this section, we consider some simple market timing strategies that exploit the forecasts
from our model. All of the investment strategies are based on the out-of-sample predictions
of states and regimes; and the simple maxim to buy low and sell high. This can take several
forms such as selling at the end of a bull market and buying at the end of a bear market.
However, our MS4 model provides much more detailed and useful information. For example,
the states that identify increasing prices are state 4 (bull state) and the riskier state 2 (bear
rally). Holding the market during periods for which forecasts assign significant probability for
these states could be fruitful.
In each case, the investor can buy the market and continue to hold the market; or sell and
hold a risk-free asset. No short selling is allowed. Here are the market timing strategies we
consider.
1. Strategy B: buy or continue to hold the market when
P (Bt = 2|r1:t−1 ) > τB and otherwise sell.
2. Strategy S: buy or continue to hold the market if
P (st = 2|r1:t−1 ) > τS or P (st = 4|r1:t−1 ) > τS and otherwise sell.
6

The first strategy B only uses the aggregate regime information associated with the probability
forecasts for Bt . The second strategy exploits the positive expected return in both the bear
rally (st = 2) and bull states (st = 4). We focus on using one cutoff value τS for both of those
states but this could be generalized and we present some evidence of this below.
Table 4 shows the investment results for 2020. All values are annualized. The annualized
return is 13.1% with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.566 if the investor buys in the first week of 2020 and
holds the position until the last week of our data sample (last Wednesday of November). This
compares with a hypothetical buy and hold return of 6.46% if an investor held the index for
our entire sample from 1885.
As reported in Table 4, using the market timing strategy B does not perform well in
2020 even with a range of alternative cutoff values, τB , for buying and selling. However,
exploiting the additional information about states provided by the MS4 model (as in strategy
S), yields positive results. For example, with τS = 0.5, the market timing strategy generates
a 22% annualized return with a Sharpe Ratio of 1.203. This investment strategy performs
significantly better than the buy and hold strategy.
Figure 8 displays returns for strategy S as a function of different values of τS . For most
values of τS ∈ (0.5, 0.9) a positive return is achieved with the best performance for values less
than 0.65.
Figure 9 shows the returns from strategy S while relaxing the constraint of a common τS
associated with both bear rally and bull states. This figure fixes τS at 0.5 for the bear rally
state, that is, buying or continuing to hold the market if P (st = 2|r1:t−1 ) > 0.5; while allowing
τS to vary for the bull state, that is, buy if P (st = 4|r1:t−1 ) > τS and sell otherwise. The
results show that it is possible to achieve even larger gains by separating the thresholds in
strategy S. This is further evidence that the added value associated with using information
inherent in the state probabilities and predictive state densities for investment strategies is
quite robust.

5.5

Long-horizon Predictions

We have focused on one-week-ahead predictions from the model and how they might be used
for investment decisions. However, the model estimates have implications for the long-run
behaviour of stock market returns. Being stationary, our MS4 model implies that any longhorizon predictions converge to the implied stationary distribution. Figure 10 and 11 report
one-year-ahead probability forecasts for states and associated regimes looking forward from
our most recent observations at the end of November 2020. What is notable is that the
transition back to normal times in the form of the long-run values of the states is slow. Even
if the effects of COVID-19 were to disappear today, our model predicts months, and not weeks,
until the stock market returns to normal times.

Robustness Results

There are a number of alternative models and comparisons we have conducted. The details
are collected in the Appendix. Here we highlight a few of these results. Table 5 reports logpredictive likelihood values for the 2020 data for several alternative models. Included is our
proposed 4-state model (MS4), an unrestricted version of MS4, a MS4 model with Student-t
innovations, a GARCH model and a MS2 model. None of these specifications improve on
our proposed MS4 model. In the Appendix, we show how these alternative models date the
turning points in 2020 and generally see a close correspondence with the MS4 model. One
7

notable exception is a 2-state Markov switching model (MS2). The MS2 classifies the summer
months as a bull state while our MS4 identifies this period as a bear market rally. This could
be considered as a drawback of the 2-state model in that it does not allow for intra-regime
dynamics.

Conclusion

This paper estimates and forecasts bull and bear markets during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Using the model of Maheu et al. (2012), we document where the market was and what has
happened to U.S. equity markets in 2020. We find that the market moved from a bull state at
the start of 2020 to a bull correction and quickly to a bear market on February 26. This bear
market dominated until April 22 when the market transitioned to a bear rally, remaining in
this phase until the current date. We show the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
the forecasts of the return distribution and how effective market timing strategies can exploit
model forecasts. Long-horizon forecasts from the model predict months, and not weeks, until
the stock market returns to normal times.

Appendix
MS4 versus GARCH

Figure 12 shows the smoothed standard deviations from the MS4 versus a GARCH(1,1) model.
The MS4 model picks up the volatility surge quickly at the beginning of 2020 and does
not have the long tapering-off period associated with the GARCH model. The implications
for Value-at-Risk are illustrated in Figure 13. The quick adjustment of the Value-at-Risk
estimates generated by the MS4 model match the high potential losses after March 2020.
This adjustment is substantially delayed and less flexible using a GARCH(1,1) model. The
latter is due to the single exponential decay parameter in the GARCH model which invokes
higher persistence and less flexible adjustment to shocks.

8.2

MS4 versus MS2

Figure 14 shows the probability of a bull market regime inferred from our 4-state model versus
a simple 2-state model for the period 2019-2020. There is one striking difference between these
two models in the period from April to September 2020. While the MS4 model classifies this
period as a bear regime (in a bear rally state), the MS2 model signals a bull regime. This
difference is due to the 2-state model not having the structure to incorporate intra-regime
dynamics. The September and October evidence from the 2-state model had the bull market
probability plunge to the bottom with small humps, while the 4-state model always estimated
that the bull regime had not been confirmed yet.

8.3

MS4-t

Figure 16 shows the bull regime probability (middle) and the probability of each individual
state (bottom) associated with assuming a Student-t distribution for each state. There is no
qualitative difference from our proposed MS4 model in Figure 2.

Predictive Likelihood Comparisons

Figure 17 illustrates differences in the cumulative predictive likelihood associated with alternative models for year 2020, using the GARCH(1,1)h model as the benchmark value.
i The
p(r2020 until t |rbefore 2020 , M)
values at time t are log predictive Bayes factor as log p(r2020 until t |rbefore 2020 , GARCH(1,1)) , where
M indicates various alternative models including the MS4. According to Kass & Raftery
0)
that is larger than 5 indicates strong data evidence to support model
(1995), a value p(r|M
p(r|M1 )
M0 . The 2020 data clearly favours the MS4 model against the GARCH(1,1). In addition,
having a Student-t distribution for each state does not provide any additional value.

8.5

MS4 with unrestricted P

Economic intuition suggests a zero restriction on p13 , p23 , p32 and p42 . Without that restriction,
the 4-state model can still identify key dates of regime change in 2020 as shown in Figure 18.
However, a closer look at Figure 19, showing the bull regime and 4-state probabilities from
both MS4 and MS4 with unrestricted P , reveals that our proposed MS4 model, which has a
restricted transition probability structure, has less uncertainty between a bull market state and
a bear rally state. From the figure, during February and July 2020 the MS4 with unrestricted
P has higher bull state probability than the MS4, because the unrestricted transition matrix
has no structure to prevent transition from the bull state to a bear rally state. As a result,
at the aggregate level, (top panel of Figure 19), the MS4 has sharper identification of regimes
than without the restriction on P . Further evidence can be seen from Figure 17, which
reveals that the out-of-sample performance of the unrestricted MS4 model is dominated by
our proposed MS4 model.
Interestingly, the MS4 model can be interpreted as a two-level hierarchical hidden Markov
model (Fine et al. (1998)), in which each level has two states with simple restrictions. The
first restriction is on the vertical down probability to incorporate the zero restrictions on
the transition matrix. The second restriction is the mean restriction for state-identification
purposes. These restrictions add value to bull and bear regime identification, and proves the
usefulness of a priori restrictions motivated by economic intuition.
