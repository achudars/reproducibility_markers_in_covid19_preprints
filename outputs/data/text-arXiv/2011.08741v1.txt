Abstract
We propose a compartmental mathematical model for the spread of the COVID-19 disease, showing
its usefulness with respect to the pandemic in Portugal, from the first recorded case in the country
till the end of the three states of emergency. New results include the compartmental model,
described by a system of seven ordinary differential equations; proof of positivity and boundedness
of solutions; investigation of equilibrium points and their stability analysis; computation of the
basic reproduction number; and numerical simulations with official real data from the Portuguese
health authorities. Besides completely new, the proposed model allows to describe quite well the
spread of COVID-19 in Portugal, fitting simultaneously not only the number of active infected
individuals but also the number of hospitalized individuals, respectively with a L2 error of 9.2152e−
04 and 1.6136e − 04 with respect to the initial population. Such results are very important, from
a practical point of view, and far from trivial from a mathematical perspective. Moreover, the
obtained value for the basic reproduction number is in agreement with the one given by the
Portuguese authorities at the end of the emergency states.
Key words: Mathematical modeling, epidemiology, COVID-19 pandemic, coronavirus disease,
qualitative theory, numerical simulations with real data.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The World
Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of international
concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
It is unanimous that the COVID-19 pandemic is the most significant global crisis of all human
history, exceeding the size and range of the repercussions of a World War: it has literally affected
all the countries of our planet with serious health, social, and economic consequences. On June
4 2020, 213 of the 247 countries or territories recognized by the United Nations had at least
one officially case of infection by COVID-19 and 185 had recorded at least one death victim.
Just focusing on the health consequences of the pandemic, it is consensual they are devastating:
COVID-19 deaths exceeded 350,000 by June 2020 and continue to grow [40].
If the COVID-19 pandemic has changed society worldwide, mathematics is no exception.
Changes are not only at the level of universities and research centers physically closed, of international traveling ban or on the rise of online seminars and conferences. It is also apparent that
COVID-19 has called attention of society about the importance of mathematics in epidemiology

and the relevance of mathematical modeling for a better understanding of the COVID-19 health
crisis [9].
The spread of infectious diseases has been studied by mathematicians for a long time. The
earliest account of mathematical modeling of the spread of a disease was carried out in 1766 by
Daniel Bernoulli: he created a mathematical model to defend the practice of inoculating against
smallpox, showing that universal inoculation would increase the life expectancy from 26 to 29
years [16].
The early 20th century saw the emergence of mathematical compartmental models. The
Kermack–McKendrick epidemic model (1927) and the Reed–Frost epidemic model (1928), both
describe the relationship between susceptible, infected and immune individuals in a population.
In particular, the Kermack–McKendrick epidemic model has shown to be successful in predicting
the behavior of many observed recorded epidemics [5]. These basic but fundamental Kermack–
McKendrick type models still serve the basis to current mathematical research on epidemiology,
e.g., for Ebola [2], TB [33], HIV [1], and cholera [21].
The use of quarantine for controlling epidemic diseases has always been controversial, because
such strategy raises political, ethical, and socio-economic issues and requires a careful balance
between public interest and individual rights [36]. Quarantine is adopted as a mean of separating
persons, animals, and goods that may have been exposed to a contagious disease. Since the
fourteenth century, quarantine has been the cornerstone of a coordinated disease-control strategy,
including isolation, sanitary cordons, bills of health issued to ships, fumigation, disinfection, and
regulation of groups of persons who were believed to be responsible for spreading of the infection
[25, 36]. Never before quarantine was adopted so widely as with COVID-19: more than half of the
entire mankind has been affected by drastic restrictions in their movements and social relationships
because of COVID-19 [3].
Recently, several compartmental models have been proposed for COVID-19 spread in different
regions of the world: see, e.g., [10] for a multi-group SEIRA model; [23] for the impact of effective
containment in the growth of confirmed cases in the outbreak in China; [11] for a COVID-19
spread study in Brazil; [26] for a COVID-19 model that considers media coverage effects; [15]
for a within-host model, which describes the interactions between SARS-CoV-2, host pulmonary
epithelial cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells; and [41], where a stochastic time-delayed model
for the effectiveness of Moroccan COVID-19 deconfinement strategy is proposed and investigated.
Here we use mathematical modeling and compartmental models, through quarantine, to study
the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. On 2 March 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was confirmed
to have reached Portugal, when it was reported that two men, a 60 year-old doctor, who traveled
to the north of Italy on vacation, and a 33 year-old man working in Spain, tested positive for
COVID-19. March 12, the Portuguese government declared the highest level of alert and said it
would be maintained until 9 April, because community transmission was detected. On March 18,
2020, the President of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, declared all Portuguese
territory in a State of Emergency for the following fifteen days, with the possibility of renewal.
This was the first State of Emergency since the Carnation Revolution in 1974. By March 24, the
Portuguese Government admitted that the country could not contain the virus any longer, and
on March 26 the country entered the “Mitigation Stage”. April 2 the Parliament approved the
extension of the State of Emergency, as requested by the President. This State of Emergency
remained until 17 April, being then renovated again. The State of Emergency was only canceled
May 2, 2020. Special measures in restricting people movements between municipalities were also
taken for the Easter celebrations, from 9 to 13 April, closing all airports to civil transportation
and increased control in the national borders. A plan to start releasing gradually the country
from COVID-19 container measures and canceling the State of Emergency was only started to be
implemented by May 4, 2020.
Our goal here is to develop a mathematical model for COVID-19 able to describe well the
pandemic in Portugal, since the emergence of the first case, on March 2, till May 4, 2020, taking into
account the real/official data made available by “Direção Geral de Saúde” (DGS, the Portuguese
Health Care Authority) [12].
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce a SAIQH (Susceptible–Asymptomatic–
2

Infectious–Quarantined–Hospitalized) mathematical model with the final purpose to investigate
COVID-19 dynamics in Portugal. The model is analyzed in Section 3, where we prove the positivity and boundedness of solutions, we compute the basic reproduction number, and we investigate
the equilibrium points of the model and their stability. The model is then shown to describe well
the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Portugal in Section 4, for the mentioned period of 64
days, between March 2 and May 4, 2020. We end with Section 5 of conclusions and discussion.
2. Model Formulation
With the final purpose to investigate COVID-19 dynamics in Portugal, we propose a SAIQH
(Susceptible–Asymptomatic–Infectious–Quarantined–Hospitalized) type model, based on a model
analyzed in [18] for the respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission dynamics in South Korea.
Here, we also consider the HIC class, of hospitalized individuals in intensive care, and the compartment D of deaths due to COVID-19. Precisely, the total living population under study at
time t, denoted by N (t), is divided into six classes at time t ≥ 0: (i) the susceptible individuals
S(t); (ii) the infected individuals without (or with mild) symptoms A(t) (the Asymptomatic); (iii)
infected individuals I(t) with visible symptoms; (iv) quarantined individuals Q(t) in isolation at
home; (v) hospitalized individuals H(t); (vi) and hospitalized individuals HIC (t) in intensive care
units. Consequently, we have
N (t) = S(t) + A(t) + I(t) + Q(t) + H(t) + HIC (t)
for all time t ≥ 0. Moreover, we also consider a seventh class, denoted by D(t), that gives
the cumulative number of deaths due to COVID-19 for all time t ≥ 0. We consider a constant
recruitment rate Λ > 0 into the susceptible class S and a constant natural death rate µ > 0 for
all time t ≥ 0 under study. Susceptible individuals can become infected with COVID-19 at a rate


β lA A(t) + I(t) + lH H(t)
,
λ(t) =
N (t)
where β > 0 is the human-to-human transmission rate per unit of time (day) and lA > 0 and lH > 0
quantify the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic individuals and hospitalized individuals,
respectively. Note that the class HIC is not included in λ(t) due to the fact that the percentage of
health care workers that get infected by SARS-CoV-2 in intensive care units is very low and can
be neglected. A fraction p ∈ [0, 1] of the susceptible population is in quarantine at home, at rate
φ > 0. Consequently, only a fraction 1 − p ∈ [0, 1] of susceptible individuals are assumed to be
able to become infected. Since there is uncertainty about immunity after recovery, we assume that
individuals of class Q will become susceptible again at rate ω > 0. We also consider that only a
fraction m ∈ [0, 1] of quarantined individuals moves from class Q to S. It means that (m × 100)%
of quarantined individuals will return to class S at the end of ω1 days. These assumptions are
justified by the state of calamity that was immediately decreed by the government of Portugal
to address the COVID-19 outbreak, which was followed by 45 days of a more severe state of
emergency. The imposed restrictions during the state of calamity and state of emergency were
fully respected by the Portuguese population.
After υ1 days of infection, only a fraction q ∈ [0, 1] of infected individuals without (or with mild)
symptoms will have severe symptoms (see [39]). Thus, (q × 100)% of individuals of compartment
A moves to I, at rate υ > 0. A fraction f1 ∈ [0, 1] of infected individuals with severe symptoms is
treated at home and the other fraction (1 − f1 ) ∈ [0, 1] is hospitalized, both at rate δ1 .
Our model consider three scenarios for hospitalized individuals:
i) a fraction f2 ∈ [0, 1] of individuals in class H can evolve to a state of severe health status,
thus needing an invasive intervention, such as artificial respiration, and, consequently, move
to intensive care units, at rate δ2 > 0;
ii) a fraction f3 ∈ [0, 1] of individuals in class H die due to COVID-19, the disease-related death
rate associated with hospitalized individuals being α1 > 0;
3

iii) a fraction (1 − f2 − f3 ) ∈ [0, 1] of individuals in class H gets better and, consequently, return
to home in quarantine/isolation, at rate δ2 .
For hospitalized individuals in intensive care units, our model considers two possibilities:
i) a fraction (1 − κ) ∈ [0, 1] of individuals in class HIC gets better and moves to the class H, at
rate η > 0;
ii) a fraction κ ∈ [0, 1] of individuals in class HIC dies due to COVID-19, the disease-related
death rate associated with hospitalized individuals in intensive care being α2 > 0.
Note that all individuals of classes S, A, I, Q, H and HIC are subject to other death reasons, at
a natural death rate µ.
The previous assumptions are translated into the following mathematical model:

3.1. Positivity and boundedness of solutions
Since system of equations (2) represents human populations, all parameters in the model are
non-negative. It can be shown that, given non-negative initial values, the solutions of the system
are non-negative. Precisely, let us consider the biologically feasible region

Proof. The rate of change of the total population, obtained by adding all the equations in model
(2), is given by

Using the standard comparison theorem [20, 35] one can easily show that

In particular, N (t) ≤ Λ
µ if N (0) ≤ µ . Thus, the region Ω is positively invariant and it is sufficient
to consider the dynamics of the flow generated by (2) in Ω. In this region, the model is epidemiologically and mathematically well posed in the sense of [16] and every solution of (2) with initial
conditions in Ω remains in Ω for all t > 0.

3.2. Equilibrium points and stability analysis
With the purpose to simplify expressions, let us introduce the following notation:
i) a0 := qv + µ;
ii) a1 := δ1 + µ;
iii) a2 := mω + µ;
iv) a3 := δ2 (1 − f2 − f3 ) + δ2 f2 + α1 f3 + µ;
v) a4 := δ2 (1 − f2 − f3 );
vi) a5 := pφ + µ;
vii) a6 := δ1 (1 − f1 );
viii) a7 := α2 k + ηk + µ;
ix) ηk := η(1 − k);
x) χ := a3 a7 − δ2 ηk f2 .
Model (2) has a disease free equilibrium, Σ0 , given by

Σ0 = (S0 , A0 , I0 , Q0 , H0 , HIC0 ) =

(3)

The local stability of Σ0 can be established using the next-generation operator method of [37].
Moreover, following the approach in [37], the basic reproduction number is given by

Lemma 3.2. The disease free equilibrium Σ0 (3) is locally asymptotically stable if R0 < 1 and
unstable if R0 > 1, where R0 is the basic reproduction number (4).
Proof. Following Theorem 2 of [37], the disease-free equilibrium (DFE), Σ0 , is locally asymptotically stable if all the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of system (2), here denoted by M (Σ0 ),
computed at the DFE Σ0 , have negative real parts. The Jacobian matrix M (Σ0 ) of system (2) at
disease free equilibrium Σ0 is given by

just proved that the disease free equilibrium Σ0 of model (2) is locally asymptotically stable if
R0 < 1 and unstable if R0 > 1.

The force of infection at the steady-state λ∗ is positive, only if R0 > 1. We have just proved the
following result.
Lemma 3.3. The model (2) has a unique endemic equilibrium whenever R0 > 1.
Remark 3.4. The dynamical behavior of model (2), when R0 = 1, can be studied following the
approach in [6]: see, e.g., [22].
4. COVID-19 Spread in Portugal
In this section, we show that model (2) describes well the transmission dynamics of COVID-19
in Portugal, taking into account the official data from daily reports of “Direção Geral de Saúde”
(DGS, the Portuguese Health Care Authority), available in [12]. We consider the COVID-19
spread in Portugal from the 2nd of March until 4th May 2020. Therefore, the initial time t = 0
corresponds to March 2, 2020.
Remark 4.1. The data considered in this paper concerns the period from the first confirmed case
with COVID-19 in Portugal and the period of confinement corresponding to the three states of
emergency that were declared between March 18, 2020 and May 2, 2020. In practice, the emergency
period hold until May 4, 2020 due to governmental measures taken during the extended weekend
of May 2 and 3, 2020, after the international workers’ day. In this Section 4, we show that the basic
reproduction number (4) for the parameter values used (cf. Table 2), takes the value R0∗ = 0.95.
This value, close to one, indicates the sensible epidemic situation in which Portugal is at the end
of three emergency states.
4.1. Initial conditions
Following the official information from [12], on 2nd March 2020 the two first infections by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, with symptoms, were confirmed in Portugal. Consequently, I0 = 2.
According to [39], only a fraction of infected individuals develops symptoms. Therefore, we
assume that I0 = q × A0 (see mathematical model (1)). Moreover, following [34], we consider the
value q = 0.15, and we obtain
I0
A0 =
≃ 13.
0.15
Following [12], we consider
H0 = HIC0 = D0 = 0.
As until 2nd March 2020 quarantine had not been advised/imposed in Portugal, we take Q0 = 0.
Some of the information used in this paper is taken from the Portuguese database PORDATA
of 2018, being 2018 the year with more recent available information [29]. Based on [29], the total
population in 2018 was equal to 10 283 800, therefore we assume N (0) = N0 = 10 283 800.
It follows that
S0 = N0 − A0 − I0 − Q0 − H0 − HIC0 = 10 283 785.
4.2. Parameter values
Following the information of [29], there were, in 2018, 87 020 newborns in Portugal. Moreover,
we assume 26 050 foreign entrances in Portugal. We can conclude that there were, on average,
87 020+26 050
newborns per day in 2018. In agreement, we assume that
365
Λ=

87 020 + 26 050
.

Furthermore, there were 113 051 deaths in 2018, in Portugal. Then, there were, on average,
deaths per day in 2018 and, consequently, we take

On 12th March 2020, Portuguese Government suspended classes from 16th March 2020 (see [31]).
Actually, the Portuguese were advised to stay at home, avoiding social contacts, since 14th March
2020, inclusive, restricting to the maximum their exits from home. As the two first infected cases in
Portugal happened on 2nd March 2010, we consider that the quarantine was adopted in education

. Using the
after twelve days after the beginning of the pandemic in Portugal, that is, φ = 12
Portuguese database PORDATA of 2018 [29], because there is no more recent official information,
we assume that there are:
i) 240 231 children in nurseries (see [28]);
ii) 987 704 students in basic education (see [29]);
iii) 401 050 students in high education (see [29]);
iv) 372 753 students in universities (see [29]).
So, 2 001 738 students were in quarantine at home, since the end of 13th March 2020. Moreover, in
2018, there were 2 228 750 individuals with age greater or equal to 65 years (see [29]). Population
with these ages were also advised to be at home, in quarantine. We also consider that unemployed
individuals (7% of the total population) have decided to be in quarantine after 13th March 2020.
As the Portuguese population in 2018 was equal to 10 283 800, we assume that there are 719 866
unemployed individuals in quarantine (see [29]). Concluding, we assume that after twelve days of
the beginning (12 days after after March 2, 2020),
2 001 738 + 2 228 750 + 719 866 = 4 950 354
individuals began their quarantine. With students at home, some parents decided to work from
home. Actually, two million of Portuguese were in this situation (see [17]). So, we assume that
the fraction of susceptible people in quarantine after twelve days of the beginning is
p=

4 950 354 + 2 000 000
≃ 0.68.
N0

Through DGS, we can consider that q = 0.15 (see [34]). According to World Health Organization
(WHO), υ1 ∈ [1, 14], but υ1 = 5 on average (see [39]).
The fraction of hospitalized individuals H that are transferred to the class HIC , given by the
parameter f2 , is computed taking the average value of the percentages of individuals in intensive
care HIC with respect to the ones that are hospitalized H, which is equal to approximately
f2 = 0.21.
The fractions of hospitalized individuals, H, and hospitalized individuals in intensive care
units, HIC , who die from COVID-19, f3 and k, respectively, are assumed to take the same values,
because there is no available information about these values separately, and they are computed
taking into account the last 42 days, according to the data in [12], taking approximately the value
f3 = k = 0.03.
The assumed value for the transfer rate from quarantine Q to susceptible S, ω = 1/31 (day −1 ),
makes sense in the context of the 45 days of state of emergency and home containment obligation
imposed by the Portuguese authorities.

4.3. Numerical simulations
Now we fit the real data from the daily Portuguese reports from [12], of the values of infected
I and hospitalized H individuals. We provide numerical simulations with respect to classes I and
H, using all the values of Table 2.
In Figure 2, we find the predicted number of infected individuals I in Portugal for t ∈ [0, 64],
through the mathematical model (1), versus real data from 2nd March 2020 to 4th may 2020,
available in [12]. It is important to note that I(t) does not represent the cumulative number of
confirmed cases at each day t, but the number of infected individuals with symptoms at each day
t.
In Figure 3, we find the predicted number of hospitalized individuals in Portugal for t ∈ [0, 64],
through the mathematical model (1), versus real data from 2nd March 2020 to 4th May 2020,
available in [12]. However, the plotted curve H, predicted by the proposed mathematical model
(1) as given in Figure 3, has a shift of 13 days with respect to reported values of hospitalized
individuals in Portugal.
The basic reproduction number R0 , given by (4), takes the value R0∗ ≃ 0.95 for the parameter
values of Table 2. The points (β = 1.93, R0∗ ), (p = 0.68, R0∗), (ω = 1/31, R0∗), and (m = 0.075, R0∗),
are marked in Figures 4–7 with the mark ∗.
Remark 4.2. Our SAIQH-like compartmental epidemic model describes very well the evolution
of COVID-19 in Portugal. Indeed, the results of the fittings are quite good: the L2 error of the fit
associated with infected individuals I (see Figure 2) and hospitalized individuals H (see Figure 3),
both with respect to the initial population N0 , are equal to 9.2152e − 04 and 1.6136e − 04, respectively. Moreover, the parameter values we are considering, correspond to a basic reproduction

number that is in agreement with the value given by the Portuguese authorities at the end of the
three emergency states (cf. page 8 of the report [32]).
We can see that at the end of the 45 days period of state of emergency, Portugal is in a possible
turning point situation where the number of new infected individuals can continue to decrease or,
in the opposite, if the number of contacts between infected and susceptible individuals increases,
the Portuguese epidemiological situation can converge to an endemic equilibrium. However, if
social distance and all preventive measures are taken, the spread of corona virus can remain in
values for which the Portuguese Health system can answer in an efficient way, has it happened
until the date of 4th May, 2020.
5. Conclusions and Discussion
SIR (Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered) type models provide powerful tools to describe and
control infection disease dynamics [19, 24, 35]. Recently, several mathematical models have been
developed to study the COVID-19 pandemic. These include [27], where the case of Wuhan is

addressed; [4], where the COVID-19 epidemic in Morocco is analyzed; [7], which investigates
the situation in Costa Rica; as well as several other investigations studying the reality of many
other countries: Canada [8], Italy [14], Pakistan [38], etc. Other studies analyze and compare
the realities of more than one country: see, e.g., [8], for the cases of China, Italy and France;
or [30], for the realities of South Korea, Italy, and Brazil. Typically, the proposed mathematical
models fits well the number of confirmed active infected cases with COVID-19. Here we propose a
new compartmental model that not only allows to fit well the number of confirmed active infected
COVID-19 cases but also fits simultaneously the number of individuals that need to be hospitalized.
This is far from being trivial and one should remark that the standard SIR, SEIR, and SEIRQ
models, as well as many other extensions found in the literature, do not allow to do this, while
our model does. Such novelty is of primordial importance, since it is well known that one crucial
point in COVID-19 pandemic is to ensure that the health systems are never overloaded.
We proposed a new compartmental model with the goal to describe the COVID-19 pandemic in
Portugal, since its emergence, on 2nd March 2020, till 4th May 4, 2020, when the Portuguese authorities started releasing gradually the country from the severe COVID-19 confinement measures
and canceling the very restrictive State of Emergency measures.

pandemic continues to propagate, since the peak of infected individuals has not yet been reached
at t = 64. Figure 3 shows a strictly increasing function in an interval [0, tmax ) and strictly
decreasing in the interval of time (tmax , 64]. We conclude that the maximum number of hospitalized
individuals has already been reached and despite the fact that the pandemic continues to spread,
hospitalization in Portugal is controlled. From Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7, we observe that the famous
R0 depends linearly on β, ω and m parameters, but the same is no longer the case with the p
parameter. Furthermore, we can see that as the values of β, ω and m increase, the value of R0
increases as well. Regarding the parameter p, the opposite happens: as the value of p increases,
the value of the basic reproduction number R0 decreases. Such numerical conclusions make sense
considering the meaning of all these parameters (see Table 1) and are in agreement with the
analytical results obtained in Section 3.
Concluding, our results show that at the end of the three emergency states declared in Portugal, the country begins 4th May 2020 a possible turning point situation where the number of
new infected individuals can continue to decrease or, in the opposite, if the number of contacts
between infected and susceptible individuals increases, the Portuguese epidemiological situation
can converge to an endemic equilibrium. However, if social distance and all preventive measures
continue to be taken, the spread of corona virus can remain in values for which the Portuguese

13

Health system can answer in an efficient way, has it happened until the date of 4th May, 2020.
Because the fraction of the population that was infected is very small and nothing is known yet
about the herd immunity of the population, there is always the danger that with the gradual
return of Portuguese population to the susceptible class, from June and July 2020 on, a very large
and rapid increase in disease transmission may result. It means that the possibility of a second
wave of COVID-19 in Portugal is not ruled out.
From the theoretical/mathematical point of view, it remains open the study of the local and
global stability of the endemic equilibrium. This seems quite difficult. From one side, for the local
stability, the computation of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the endemic
equilibrium is cumbersome. For the global stability, finding a suitable Lyapunov function is also
a difficult task. These are interesting open problems.
