As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shown profound effects on public health and the economy worldwide, it becomes crucial to assess the impact on the virus transmission and develop effective strategies to
address the challenge. A new statistical model derived from the SIR epidemic
model with functional parameters is proposed to understand the impact of
weather and government interventions on the virus spread and also provide
the forecasts of COVID-19 infections among eight metropolitan areas in the
United States. The model uses Bayesian inference with Gaussian process priors to study the functional parameters nonparametrically, and sensitivity analysis is adopted to investigate the main and interaction effects of these factors.
This analysis reveals several important results including the potential interaction effects between weather and government interventions, which shed new
light on the effective strategies for policymakers to mitigate the COVID-19
outbreak.

1. Introduction. As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already
had profound effects on public health and the economy worldwide, how to use
statistical approaches to model and understand the spread of COVID-19 to inform
and educate the public about the virus transmission and develop effective strategies
for addressing this challenge has become crucial. In particular, the understanding
of how the potential environmental factors, such as weather and government interventions, affect the virus transmissibility is important yet unclear. Moreover,
an effective strategy to mitigate the outbreak based on the weather conditions is
in extreme need for policymakers yet little attention has been paid to the interaction effect between weather and government interventions. For instance, a natural
question for policymakers is “Should the government implement more restrictions
to mitigate the pandemic as the weather gets colder?”
There has been many studies on the impact of weather and government interventions since the COVID-19 outbreak but remain some challenges. To name a few, Yu
(2020); Xu et al. (2020); Carson et al. (2020) find it evident that the weather temperature is somehow associated with the COVID-19 spread, while Jamil et al. (2020);
Gupta, Pradhan and Maulud (2020) find no significant associations. Cowling et al.

(2020); Haug et al. (2020); Haldar and Sethi (2020); Flaxman et al. (2020) investigate the impacts of government interventions on COVID-19 spread and most of the
studies show that government interventions are associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19. However, most of work focus on individual effects of weather
and government interventions, which may lead to misleading results due to potential collinearity issues (Wilson, 2020), and these methods cannot be directly
extended to multiple factors due to model complications. Besides, the interaction
effects between weather and government interventions are not available if their
effects are estimated separately.
In this paper, we employ a nonparametric regression method not only to model
the impacts of weather and government interventions jointly, which incorporates
with an epidemic model that allows us to evaluate the effects on the virus transmissibility, but also provide forecasts of future COVID-19 infections. Specifically,
a Gaussian process prior (Williams and Rasmussen, 2006) is imposed on the functional parameters in the susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model (Kermack and
McKendrick, 1927), and based on this model, the posterior distribution of the basic reproduction number, which is used to measure the transmission potential of a
disease, will be derived. The main effects and interaction effects of these factors
will be analyzed by the sensitivity analysis (Sobol, 1993).
It is worth noting that the process of estimating the parameters associated with
the epidemic models is often called calibration in the computer experiment literature (Kennedy and O’Hagan, 2001; Santner, Williams and Notz, 2018; Tuo and
Wu, 2015). Although there are numerous developments on calibration, most of the
existing work are based on scalar parameters rather than functional parameters.
Exceptions include the recent work by Plumlee, Joseph and Yang (2016); Brown
and Atamturktur (2018), but their work are based on continuous outputs with a
Gaussian assumption, which is not valid for the count data in the epidemic models
in our application.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the SIR model
and a modified SIR model with functional parameters will be introduced. The statistical model incorporating with the SIR model will be explicitly described in
Section 3. Numerical studies are conducted in Section 4 to examine the performance. In Section 5, the statistical model is applied to the COVID-19 outbreak to
assess the impacts of weather and government interventions. Concluded remarks
are given in Section 6, and the details of sampling for the posterior distributions
are given in Appendix. The R (R Core Team, 2018) code and data for reproducing
the results in this paper are provided in Supplementary Material.
2. Compartmental models in epidemiology.

3

2.1. SIR model. Compartmental models are widely used in epidemiology which
simplify the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. One of the prominent
models is the SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927; Diekmann, Heesterbeek and Britton, 2013), which assigns the population to three compartments: susceptible (S), infectious (I), and recovered (R), where the three compartments represent the number of the susceptible individuals, the infected individuals, and the
recovered or deceased individuals, respectively. The SIR model has been widely
used for understanding how a disease spreads in outbreaks of measles, influenza,
rubella, smallpox, Ebola, monkeypox, SARS, and the current COVID-19 pandemic. See, for example, Osthus et al. (2017); Chen et al. (2020); Cooper, Mondal
and Antonopoulos (2020); Roda et al. (2020); D’Arienzo and Coniglio (2020).
Mathematically speaking, the transition of the three compartments can be expressed by the ordinary differential equations as follows,
(1)

dS(t)
βI(t)S(t)
=−
,
dt
N

dI(t)
βI(t)S(t)
=
− γI(t),
dt
N

dR(t)
= γI(t),
dt

where S(t), I(t) and R(t) represent the numbers of cases in the corresponding
compartment, N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) is the total population, β is the contact rate
that represents the average number of contacts per person per time in the susceptible compartment, and γ is the recovery rate from the infectious compartment. The
ratio of β and γ is called the basic reproduction number in epidemiology, often
denoted by R0 := β/γ, which indicates the average number of infected cases generated by a typical infectious individual when introduced into a fully susceptible
population. This number is of great importance in public health and epidemiology,
which is often used to measure the transmission potential of a disease or a virus
(Dietz, 1993; Zhao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Essentially, when R0 is larger
than 1, the infection will be able to start spreading in a population, and the larger
R0 is, the harder it is to control the epidemic.
2.2. Modified SIR model. Despite the SIR model has been widely used in epidemiology, the model has been shown that it cannot reflect the reality due to its
simplifications and assumptions. See, for example, Heesterbeek et al. (2015); Sung
and Hung (2020). In particular, the constant parameter assumption of β and γ,
which implies that the contact rate and the recovery rate are both fixed in the entire
process, has been shown that it is too strong to be satisfied in reality (Cowling,
Ho and Leung, 2008; Cauchemez et al., 2016; Hong and Li, 2020; Yu, 2020; Ambrosio and Aziz-Alaoui, 2020). Therefore, in this article, we consider a modified,
more flexible, SIR model by assuming that the parameters can vary based on some
environmental factors.
First, similar to Hong and Li (2020), we consider a discrete version of SIR mod-

4

els by replacing the derivatives in (1) with finite differences, which results in
βI(t)(N − I(t) − R(t))
− γI(t),
N
R(t + 1) − R(t) = γI(t),

I(t + 1) − I(t) =

Then, by assuming the functional parameters β(x) and γ(x), where x ∈ Ω ⊆ Rd
is a d-dimensional factor, and expressing the equations in a recursive fashion, a
modified SIR model can be expressed as
I(t + 1) = (1 + β(x) − γ(x))I(t) + β(x)I(t)(I(t) + R(t))/N,
R(t + 1) = R(t) + γ(x)I(t),
and S(t + 1) = N − I(t + 1) − R(t + 1) for t ∈ N ∪ {0}. Thus, the number of
the daily infectious cases at day t based on the modified SIR is the difference in
susceptible from day t − 1 to day t, which we denoted as
(2)

f (t, β(x), γ(x)) := S(t − 1) − S(t).

3. A statistical model incorporating with the SIR model.
3.1. Gaussian process priors for functional parameters. In this section, we
introduce a statistical model incorporating with the modified SIR model in (2).
First, denote yt as the daily reported number of infectious cases at day t, and
assume yt follows an independent Poisson distribution with the mean function
f (t, β(x), γ(x)), that is,
(3)

indep.

yt ∼ Poi(f (t, β(x), γ(x))).

The functional parameters in the SIR model are assumed to follow a joint Gaussian
process (GP) prior:
logit (β(·)) ∼ GP(µ1 (·), τ Kφ (·, ·)),
(4)

logit (γ(·)) ∼ GP(µ2 (·), τ Kφ (·, ·)),

Cov logit (β(x)) , logit γ(x0 ) = ρτ Kφ (x, x0 ) for any

x, x0 ∈ Ω,

where logit(x) = x/(1 − x) and Cov(x, y) is the covariance between x and y.
The logit transformation is used here because both β and γ are rates which are
bounded from zero to one, but the Gaussian process prior has positive measures
over the negative reals. Other transformation, such as the probit function, Φ−1 (x),
the cumulative log-log function, log(− log(x)), or the identity function, x, could
be also used here. µj (·) is the mean function, where we assume a constant mean,

5

i.e., µj (x) = µj . τ > 0 is the process variance, and kφ is the correlation function, for which a Gaussian correlation function is commonly used in the form of
Kφ (x, x0 ) = exp(−kφT (x − x0 )k2 ) for any x, x0 ∈ Ω, where φ ∈ Rp is the
unknown correlation parameter. Note that the correlation function is usually reparameterized as
(5)

Kφ (x, x0 ) =

d
Y

4(xj −x0j )2

φj

for any x, x0 ∈ Ω,

j=1

where φ = (φ1 , . . . , φd ) ∈ (0, 1)d , for the purpose of numerical stability, because
the domain of φj ∈ (0, 1) is now bounded. See, for example, Brown and Atamturktur (2018) and Mak et al. (2018). As a result, the form of the correlation function
(5) is used throughout this article.
In (4), we assume that logit(β(·)) and logit(γ(·)) are correlated with a crosscorrelation, ρ, which implies that for any given x ∈ Ω, the correlation between
logit(β(x)) and logit(γ(x)) is ρ. This assumption is similar to the separable correlation function in Stein and Corsten (1991); Mardia and Goodall (1993); Brown,
Le and Zidek (1994); Banerjee and Gelfand (2002); Qian, Wu and Wu (2008).
The dependence assumption of the two parameters is crucial and appealing from
an epidemiological perspective. For the compartmental models like SIR, it is well
known that the parameters are strongly coupled in the modeling literature. See, for
example, the joint posterior distribution in Roda et al. (2020) which shows a strong
correlation between the two parameters in an SIR model. Thus, the independent
GP assumption like in Brown and Atamturktur (2018) and Plumlee, Joseph and
Yang (2016) is not valid in this application. Numerical studies in Section 4 demonstrate the comparison of the two assumptions, which shows that the joint GP prior
can outperform the independent one when there exists correlations between the
parameters.
Suppose that we observe the reported infectious cases in n days, which are denoted by yn = (y1 , . . . , yn ). Denote βt = β(xt ), γt = γ(xt ), β = (β1 , . . . , βn ),
and γ = (γ1 , . . . , γn ). Furthermore, denote 1n = (1, . . . , 1)T ∈ Rn×1 and Kφ =
(Kφ (xi , xj ))1≤i,j≤n ∈ Rn×n . Then, together with the model assumptions (3), (4)

and (5), we have the following hierarchical model,

where (6), (7), (8), (9) are the priors of the parameters τ, ρ, φj and µj , in which
InvGamma(a, b) is an inverse gamma distribution with shape parameter a and rate
parameter b, and Beta(1, b) is a beta distribution with parameters 1 and b. It is
worth noting that the cross-correlation ρ has positive measures only over the positive reals, which is reasonable because the parameters are commonly found to be
positively correlated in the epidemiology literature (Roda et al., 2020).
3.2. Posterior Distributions. The goal of this study is to infer the functional
parameters β(x) and γ(x) and subsequently investigate whether the d-dimensional
factor x plays a role in varying the basic reproduction number, which is denoted
by R0 (x) := β(x)/γ(x). In addition, predicting the number of future infections
based on forecast weather and government interventions, say xn+1 , is also of great
interest. Therefore, the joint posterior distribution of β(x), γ(x), and the number
of the future daily infected cases are developed as follows.
We first derive the joint posterior distribution of β(x) and γ(x). Denote the
parameters ψ = (ρ, φ, µ1 , µ2 , τ ) and data = (yn , Xn ). Then, the posterior distribution given observations can be obtained by
π(β(x), γ(x),β, γ, ψ|data)
∝π(β(x), γ(x)|β, γ, ψ, data)π(β, γ, ψ|data),
where π(x|y) denotes the posterior distribution of x given y. Thus, the joint posterior distribution of β(x) and γ(x) can be approximated by Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) by drawing the samples from π(β(x), γ(x)|β, γ, ψ, data) and π(β, γ, ψ|data)
iteratively. The posterior π(β(x), γ(x)|β, γ, ψ, data) can be drawn based on the

γ(x) can then be obtained by sampling from the multivariate normal distribution of

The samples from this posterior distribution can be drawn by Gibbs sampling with
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In particular, similar to Neal (1998) and Brown
and Atamturktur (2018), we use a multivariate normal distribution as a proposal to
sample β and γ, which draws a proposal of (β 0 , γ 0 ) by

where Z ∼ Nn (0, In ) and In is an identity matrix of size n × n, and c > 0 is a
small constant which can be adaptively determined by monitoring the acceptance
rate as in Brown and Atamturktur (2018). For the parameters ρ and φj , we use a
normal distribution as a proposal, which draws a proposal of ρ0 and φ0j by
log(− log(ρ0 )) = log(− log(ρ)) + N (0, cρ )

8

C.-L. SUNG

and
log(− log(φ0j )) = log(− log(φj )) + N (0, cφj ),
respectively, where cρ and cφj are small constants which similarly can be adaptively determined. For the parameters µ1 , µ2 and τ , the samples can be directly
drawn from their conditional distributions, which are multivariate normal and inverse gamma distributions, respectively. We leave the details of the Gibbs sampling
for the posterior π(β, γ, ψ|data) to Appendix A.
Now we move to the posterior distribution of the number of future infections.
Let xn+1 be the forecast weather and government interventions at time n + 1, and
denote βn+1 = β(xn+1 ), γn+1 = γ(xn+1 ). Then the posterior distribution of the
infected number, yn+1 , given observations has
π(yn+1 ,βn+1 , γn+1 , β, γ, ψ|xn+1 , data)
∝π(yn+1 |βn+1 , γn+1 )π(βn+1 , γn+1 |β, γ, ψ, xn+1 )π(β, γ, ψ|data).
Similarly, this posterior distribution can be drawn by MCMC sampling, where the
samples for π(β, γ, ψ|data) can be drawn as introduced before, and the samples
from π(βn+1 , γn+1 |β, γ, ψ, xn+1 ) can be similarly drawn from the multivariate
normal distribution (10). π(yn+1 |βn+1 , γn+1 ) follows a Poisson distribution with
the mean f (n+1, βn+1 , γn+1 ). Thus, the MCMC samples can be drawn iteratively
from π(yn+1 |βn+1 , γn+1 ), π(βn+1 , γn+1 |β, γ, ψ, xn+1 ), and π(β, γ, ψ|data).
4. Simulation Study. In this section, simulation studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed method. In the simulations, the hyperparameters in the priors (6), (7), (8), (9), are set as follow. Similar to Brown and
Atamturktur (2018), the shape parameters bρ and bφ are chosen to be 0.1, which
place most probability mass near one to enforce the smoothness for the functional
parameters; a = 0.01 and b p
= 0.01 are chosen so that the prior is centered at
one with standard deviation 0.01/0.012 = 10; for (9) we set α1 = α2 = 0
and σ12 = σ22 = 1. For the MCMC sampling, 2,000 iterations are performed in a
burn-in period, and after that additional 2,000 MCMC samples are drawn, which
are thinned to reduce autocorrelation.
Suppose that the observation yt is simulated from a Poisson distribution with
the mean function, f (t, β(x), γ(x)) = 5β(x) + γ(x)(t/10)2 , where x is onedimensional factor in the space [0, 1]. Let β(x) = sin(3x) exp(−x) + 0.2 and
γ(x) = sin(3x). The left panel of Figure 1 demonstrates the two functions β(x)
and γ(x), and it can be seen that these two curves share some similarity overall,
which suggests that the dependence assumption of these two functions is necessary. We generate x1 , . . . , x40 from a uniform distribution, and randomly generate
n = 40 observations, y1 , . . . , y40 . The right panel of Figure 1 shows the random

samples as dots, where the solid line is the true mean function f (t, β(x), γ(x)).

samples as the test dataset.

posterior means can recover the true functions very well. The predictions on the
test dataset are shown in the left panel of Figure 3, which shows that the posterior
mean is reasonably close to the true function. These results demonstrate that the
proposed method can perform well for the models with functional parameters in
terms of estimation and prediction. To further examine the performance, we com-

pare with the model under the assumption of independent GPs, which is close to
the assumption in Plumlee, Joseph and Yang (2016) and Brown and Atamturktur

be not as close to the true functions as the ones from our proposed model, along
with wider confidence intervals. The right panel of Figure 3 illustrates the posterior draws of the predictions on the test data based on independent GPs, which also
shows that the joint GP prior can produce more accurate predictions compared to
independent GPs.

5. Application to COVID-19. In this section, we leverage the proposed model
to analyze the COVID-19 virus spread among the eight largest metropolitan areas
in the United States (US). In particular, the impacts of weather and government interventions on the virus transmissibility will be explored, and the forecast of daily
infected cases based on these factors will be provided.
The data source is briefly introduced here. The daily COVID-19 cases are obtained at the US county level from the data repository provided by New York Times
(Almukhtar et al., 2020). The population sizes are obtained from the census bureau
website, which also can be found in Yu (2020). The historical weather data and the
weather forecast are collected from the Weather Underground (The Weather Company, 2020), which include the daily average temperature, humidity, wind speed,
pressure, and precipitation. The information of government interventions is obtained from New York Times (Lee et al., 2020) and local media, where we categorize the interventions into five levels: (1) no intervention; (2) all businesses are
open with mask required and some capacity limitations ; (3) all industries resume
operations but some indoor services, such as bars and restaurants, remain closed;
(4) Industries resume operations with severe restrictions and capacity limitations;
(5) all non-essential businesses are closed. Scatterplots for every pair of factors are
demonstrated in Figure 5, where it appears to have no obvious relationship between
any pair of the factors.
Now we are ready to apply the proposed model to the data, where the setting
of the MCMC sampling is similar to the one in Section 4. Consider the confirmed
cases from the day that the first case was reported to November 11 as the training data, and the cases from November 12 to 25 as the test data. Since the actual
infectious period for COVID-19 is not available and it varies by individual and
situation, as suggested by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Wilson
(2020), we assume an infectious period of 11 days from the actual infection to the
confirmation of the positive test result. In other words, we assume that the actual
infection occurs 11 days prior to the confirmation date. Alternatives for estimating
the infectious period are discussed in Section 6. The input factor is a 6-dimensional
variable, i.e., x ∈ R6 , including 5 variables representing weather data and one variable representing government intervention levels. The MCMC samples of the basic
reproduction number can be obtained from the MCMC samples of β(x) and γ(x)
by computing R0 (x) = β(x)/γ(x). Since it’s hard to visualize the function R0 (x)
via a six-dimensional x, similar to Welch et al. (1992), we use a functional ANOVA
decomposition (Hoeffding, 1948; Sobol, 1993; Santner, Williams and Notz, 2018)
for R0 (x) and plot its overall mean and main effects. That is, suppose that x follows a distribution F (x) where F (x) = F1 (x1 ) × F2 (x2 ) × · · · × Fd (xd ), then the

and mj (xj ) can be naturally drawn via a Monte-Carlo sampling method. This is
similar to Le Gratiet, Cannamela and Iooss (2014) for estimating the Sobol indices
through a surrogate model that accounts for both the integration errors and the
surrogate model uncertainty.
The boxplots of the overall means of R0 (x) are shown in Figure 6. It can be seen
that among these eight cities, Chicago has the highest basic reproduction number
than other cities, which implies that each existing infection in Chicago can cause
more new infections than other cities, while the existing infection in New York
causes less new infections than others. Before illustrating the main effects, the
sensitivity analysis (Sobol, 1993) is adopted to determine which input factors are
responsible for the most variation in the basic reproduction number. The result is
shown in Figure 7. Although no unique factor can dominate the others for all of the
cities in terms of sensitivity index, it appears that government interventions have
made stronger impacts than weather factors on the virus spread in most of the cities,
especially in Baltimore and Chicago. On the other hand, some cities, such as Los
Angeles, Houston, and Saint Louis, have shown the evidence that temperature has
played a crucial role in explaining the variation of the basic reproduction number.

Fig 6: Overall mean of basic reproduction number.
The main effects of R0 (x) are demonstrated in Figure 8. As have shown in the
sensitivity analysis, the intervention factor has larger variations in the main effects,
ranging from -0.1 to 0.3, whereas the main effects of the weather factors range from
-0.1 to 0.1. Among these six factors, it shows that temperature and government
intervention both have negative effects on the virus spread for all of the cities,
while other factors have no common trend. In particular, except for Houston, it
appears that decreasing the temperature in 10◦ F will increase roughly 0.025 in the
basic reproduction number. This result is quite promising in the sense that most of
the existing methods cannot directly quantify the effect of temperature on the basic
reproduction number. The intervention factor shows that the basic reproduction

number can be effectively reduced if governments implement more restrictions to
combat the COVID-19 outbreak, especially for Baltimore and Chicago, which can
decrease approximately 0.4 in the basic reproduction number from no intervention
to the strictest restriction. This finding is consistent with the results in some recent
work on the effect of government intervention for COVID-19, such as Flaxman
et al. (2020); Haug et al. (2020); Haldar and Sethi (2020); Wang et al. (2020).
We further investigate the interaction effects of the basic reproduction number.
Particularly, we focus on the interaction effects between the intervention factor,
which is controllable by governments, and the five weather factors, which are uncontrollable. The sensitivity indices (Sobol, 1993) of these five interaction effects
are first computed to compare their relative importance. For the sake of saving the
space, only the interaction effects for New York are demonstrated here, as other
cities have no obvious interaction effects. The sensitivity indices and the interaction plot with the highest index are shown in the left and right panels of Figure
9, respectively. It can be seen that the interaction effect between temperature and
government interventions has the highest sensitivity index, and from the interaction
plot of the two factors, it appears that when governments implement more restrictions, the effect of temperature on the virus spread tends to be milder. This result
suggests that as the weather gets colder, policymakers may need to implement more
restrictions to mitigate the pandemic.

Last but not least, we validate the proposed model by performing predictions
on the test data from November 12 to 25. The prediction results of the eight cities
are shown in Figure 10. The predictions are reasonably accurate over the 14-day
period. Particularly, in the cities New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Saint
Louis, the infected cases tend to increase over the 14-day period and our predictions
successfully capture the trend. This shows strong empirical justification for our
model specification.

6. Concluding Remarks. How the weather and government interventions affect the spread of a disease has been an important question but remains unclear
in the literature. A new statistical model that incorporates with the prominent SIR
model is employed to study the impact on the COVID-19 virus transmissibility
among eight US metropolitan areas. The Gaussian process modeling and the sensitivity analysis for the functional parameters enable to investigate the the main and
interaction effects of the factors, which could lead to a new intervention strategy
for policymakers. This study shows that, among six environmental factors, government interventions have the strongest impact on the COVID-19 virus spread in
most of the cities. The weather temperature has been found to have negative effects
in all of the cities. Other weather factors, such wind speed and pressure, do not
show common effects among the eight cities. New York city has shown a strong
interaction effect between temperature and interventions, which suggests that more
restrictions are necessary to mitigate the outbreak as the weather gets colder.
Although we found some potential associations between weather and virus transmissibility, it is worth emphasizing that these associations may not directly imply
the causation of the virus transmissibility, meaning that there might be some lurking/causal variables which are correlated with these factors that make the associations appear stronger. For instance, as recent studies have showed (e.g., Wilson
(2020); Soucy et al. (2020)), the individual mobility may have the direct impact
on the COVID-19 spread, which could be strongly correlated with weather factors. Therefore, incorporating the information of individual mobility and estimating the causal effects of mobility and weather is worthwhile to investigate in the
future work. Furthermore, it is also worthwhile to study how to estimate the actual
infection period more accurately. It is conceivable to consider a more sophisticated epidemic model, such as the SEIR model (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-
