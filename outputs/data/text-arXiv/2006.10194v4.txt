We study the disproportionate impact of the lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak on female and
male academics’ research productivity in social science. The lockdown has caused substantial disruptions
to academic activities, requiring people to work from home. How this disruption affects productivity and
the related gender equity is an important operations and societal question. We collect data from the largest
open-access preprint repository for social science on 41,858 research preprints in 18 disciplines produced
by 76,832 authors across 25 countries over a span of two years. We use a difference-in-differences approach
leveraging the exogenous pandemic shock. Our results indicate that, in the 10 weeks after the lockdown in the
United States, although total research productivity increased by 35 percent, female academics’ productivity
dropped by 13.2 percent relative to that of male academics. We also show that this intensified productivity
gap is more pronounced for assistant professors and for academics in top-ranked universities and is found in
six other countries. Our work points out the fairness issue in productivity caused by the lockdown, a finding
that universities will find helpful when evaluating faculty productivity. It also helps organizations realize the
potential unintended consequences that can arise from telecommuting.

Introduction

The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly changed the way people live and
work. Many people have been forced to work from home through telecommuting, potentially affecting their productivity. We study how this pandemic shock affected academics’ research productivity
using data from the world’s largest open-access repository for social science—the Social Science
Research Network (SSRN).1 We provide evidence that, as a result of the lockdown in the United
States, female researchers’ productivity dropped significantly relative to that of male researchers.
In response to the pandemic, the US and many other countries required their citizens to stay
at home. As a result of the lockdown, many people have had to perform work duties at home

along with household duties. Most countries have also closed schools and daycare centers, massively
increasing childcare needs. With the childcare provided by grandparents and friends limited due
to the social distancing protocol, parents must care for their children themselves. In addition,
restaurants have been either closed or do not allow dine-ins, which has increased the need for food
preparation at home. Given that women, on average, carry out disproportionately more childcare,
domestic labor, and household responsibilities (Bianchi et al. 2012), they are likely to be more
affected than men by the lockdown.
The lockdown has also disrupted how academics carry out their activities. Many countries have
closed their universities, so faculty have to teach and conduct research from home. A researcher’s
productivity is jointly determined by his or her available time for research and research efficiency
(KC 2019). First, given the unequal distribution of domestic duties, the pandemic is more likely
to burden female researchers with more home-related tasks, leaving them less time to dedicate to
research. Second, scientific research generally requires a quiet and interruption-free environment.
As a result of the pandemic, female researchers are more likely to multitask between research and
home-related tasks and thus to have lower efficiency in conducting research. Together, these factors
suggest that female academics’ productivity is likely to be disproportionately affected compared
with that of male academics.
Anecdotal evidence provides mixed support for this prediction (Dolan and Lawless 2020). A
recent survey involving 4,500 principal investigators reported significant and heterogeneous declines
in the time they spend on research (Myers et al. 2020). Several journal editors have noticed that,
while there was a 20–30-percent increase in submissions after the pandemic started, most was
from male academics (Beck 2020). Amano-Patiño et al. (2020) find a particularly large number
of senior male economists, rather than mid-career economists, exploring research questions arising
from the COVID-19 shock. Others have seen no change or have been receiving comparatively
more submissions from women since the lockdown (Kitchener 2020). Overall, there is a dearth of
systematic evidence on whether and to what extent the shock has affected gender inequality in
academia. We provide such systematic evidence, showing an unequal impact on productivity for
female and male researchers.
It is an important operations and societal question to understand the change in productivity
and the related gender equity caused by the reorganization of work and care at home. In this
paper, we use a large dataset on female and male academics’ production of new research papers to
systematically study whether COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown have had a disproportionate
effect on female academics’ productivity. We also identify the academic ranks, universities, and
countries in which this inequality is intensified.

We collect data on all research papers uploaded to SSRN in 18 disciplines from December 2018
to May 2019 and from December 2019 to May 2020. We extract information on paper titles and
the authors’ names, affiliations, and addresses, which we use to identify the authors’ countries and
academic ranks, and the ranking of their institutions. We also use their names and faculty webpages
to identify their gender. In particular, we use a large database to predict authors’ gender. For author
names with a prediction confidence level lower than 80 percent, we use Amazon Mechanical Turk
to identify gender manually. The final dataset includes 41,858 papers written by 76,832 authors
from 25 countries. Our main analysis focuses on US academics; we then perform the same analysis
for other countries.
We use a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to estimate the effect. We compute the number
of papers produced by female and male academics in each week, then compare the variations in the
productivity gap between genders before and after the start of the lockdown and show that the gap
increased after the start of the lockdown. We also validate that female and male authors’ preprint
volumes followed the same parallel time trend before the lockdown and that there was no significant
change in the research productivity gap in 2019 during the same time of year. Taken together, these
results suggest that the intensified disparity has primarily been driven by the pandemic shock.
We find that during the 10 weeks since the lockdown began in the US, female academics’ research
productivity dropped by 13.2 percent compared to that of male academics. The effect persists
when we vary the time window since the pandemic outbreak. Our findings show that when female
and male academics face a reorganization of care and work time, women become significantly less
productive by producing fewer papers. We also find that the quality of their uploaded papers,
measured by the download and view rates, does not change. Finally, we find that the effect is more
pronounced among assistant professors and among researchers in top-ranked research universities
and that it exists in six other countries.
While gender inequality has been long documented for academics in terms of tenure evaluation
(Antecol et al. 2018), coauthoring choices (Sarsons 2017), and number of citations (Ghiasi et al.
2015), the COVID-19 pandemic brings this issue to the forefront. Our study is among the first
to rigorously quantify such inequality in research productivity as a result of the pandemic and
our results highlight that this disruption has exacerbated gender inequality in the academic world.
Because all academics participate together in open competition for promotions and positions, these
short-term changes in productivity will affect their long-term career outcomes (Minello 2020). Thus,
institutions should take this inequality into consideration when evaluating faculty members.
Our paper contributes to the literature on productivity, a central topic in operations management. Previous studies have examined key determinants of workers’ productivity, such as workers’
capacity (Tan and Netessine 2014, KC 2019), multitasking (KC 2014, Bray et al. 2016, KC 2020),

4

peer effects (Song et al. 2018, Tan and Netessine 2019), and task sequences (Ibanez et al. 2018). We
contribute to the literature by showing that the disruption due to the pandemic has significantly
enlarged the productivity gap between female and male researchers, highlighting fairness as an
important factor in performance evaluation.
Our work also sheds light on the fairness issues that could arise from telecommuting, an operations choice faced by companies. Since working from home can provide a flexible work schedule for
employees and reduce office-related costs for companies, an increasing number of companies are
choosing this operating model. Between 2005 and 2015, the number of US employees who chose to
telecommute increased by 115% (Abrams 2019). By 2019, about 16% of the total workforce in the
US was working remotely full time or part time (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2019). During
the pandemic, telecommuting is a constraint rather than a choice; many companies were forced to
allow telecommuting. But going forward, an increasing number of companies may choose to offer
this operating model to provide flexible work schedule to employees and reduce office-related costs.
For example, Twitter and Facebook have already announced that their employees could work from
home permanently (McLean 2020) and JP Morgan planned to expand its telecommuting program
(Kelly 2020). Despite the growing popularity of telecommuting, scholars and practitioners still lack
a comprehensive understanding of the managerial and societal impact of this operational choice
(Nicklin et al. 2016). We contribute to the literature by pointing out the productivity inequality
caused by the lockdown and telecommuting, which might lead to a longer-term unemployment risk
for women, an unintended consequence that companies and society should take into account when
making their operational choices or designing policies for performance evaluation. Our findings
help institutions and firms understand the potential implications in designing and implementing
telecommuting.

Literature Review

Our work is closely related to three streams of literature: productivity, social operations, and
telecommuting.
2.1.

Productivity

According to the productivity literature (KC and Terwiesch 2009, Tan and Netessine 2014), working in different environments causes significant changes in operational factors that drive worker’s
productivity. In our context, due to the pandemic, researchers have to change to working from
home, potentially affecting several drivers of productivity identified by research, such as multitasking, workload, task sequence, and peer effects.
Multitasking is particularly relevant to our research context. When working from home during the
pandemic, researchers may need to allocate their limited cognitive capacity across home-related and

Cui, Ding, Zhu:

work-related tasks, thus dealing with more distractions arising from multitasking. Prior studies have
shown mixed effects of multitasking on workers’ productivity, such as an increased service speed
with a lower service quality for restaurant waiters (Tan and Netessine 2014) and a slower processing
for bank associates (Staats and Gino 2012). The productivity losses could be greater for jobs
requiring greater cognitive capacity. For example, in the judiciary system, reducing multitasking
has been shown to help judges focus on the most recent cases, reduce the switching costs between
cases, and increase the case completion rate (Bray et al. 2016). In healthcare, excessive multitasking
and frequent interruptions in the work flow have been shown to undermine the productivity of
discharging (KC 2014), processing (Berry Jaeker and Tucker 2017), and medication delivery (Batt
and Terwiesch 2017).
Workload, task sequences, and peer effects are examples of other operations drivers in researchers’
productivity during the pandemic. Workers have been shown to adjust their productivity based on
their workload, slowing down when facing more workload and speeding up when facing less because
they internalize the congestion cost (KC and Terwiesch 2009, Tan and Netessine 2014). However,
the extra workload could make workers fatigued, which could reduce productivity (Salvendy 2012,
KC 2019). Technology—such as tabletop technology in restaurants—has been shown to improve
workers’ productivity by reducing their non-value-added tasks, enabling them to focus on more
important tasks (Tan and Netessine 2020). The literature has also identified workers’ choice of
task sequence as a productivity factor (Staats and Gino 2012, Ibanez et al. 2018). Workers tend to
deviate to suboptimal task sequences when facing a higher workload or when fatigued (KC et al.
2020). Another driver of workers’ productivity is peer effects—workers adapt their own productivity
to that of their peers’ (Schultz et al. 1998). For example, having a particularly capable worker on
a shift could motivate slower workers to speed up but could also discourage good performers as it
becomes more difficult for them to outperform their peers and reach their goals (Tan and Netessine
2019). Displaying peers’ productivity publicly has been shown to improve productivity (Song et al.
2018).
2.2.

Social Operations

This paper sheds light on a key social issue—fairness and equity—in research productivity, adding
to the growing literature on the social impact of operational choices. Several recent influential
papers by Tang and Zhou (2012), Lee and Tang (2018), and Dai et al. (2020) encourage OM
researchers to work on socially responsible topics that are important to corporations and to society
at large. Papers have examined the use of review information to reduce racial discrimination arising
in the sharing economy (Cui et al. 2020, Mejia and Parker 2020) and the gender inequality driven by
specific compensation schemes (Pierce et al. 2020). The literature on gender bias has shown evidence

6

Cui, Ding, Zhu:

Gender Inequality in Research Productivity

that female researchers and students tend to be discredited when they are evaluated alongside
equally competent male candidates (Moss-Racusin et al. 2012, Sarsons 2017), that women are more
likely to be assigned more service-oriented and less desirable tasks(Guarino and Borden 2017) with
fewer promotion opportunities (Babcock et al. 2017), and that women are often responsible for
more housework and childcare (Schiebinger and Gilmartin 2010, Misra et al. 2012).
In our context, when working from home, the unequal distribution of housework means that
women are more likely to deal with non-work-related tasks during the lockdown and lose productivity. A recent survey involving 4,500 principal investigators shows that female scientists self-reported
a sharper reduction in research time during the lockdown, primarily due to childcare needs (Myers
et al. 2020). We contribute to the literature by providing evidence that the lockdown affects productivity and exacerbates gender inequity in the workplace, potentially leading to a long-term career
risk for women, an unintended consequence that organizations should consider when designing
their operations models and performance evaluation policies.
2.3.

Telecommuting

Our work is also related to the emerging literature on organizations’ telecommuting choices. Transitioning from traditional in-office work to telecommuting might affect workers’ behavior and productivity through team-work and peer effects. For example, Dutcher and Saral (2012) observe that
workers do not indulge in free-riding behavior when a team is made up of in-office workers and
telecommuters, and Bloom et al. (2015) demonstrates that telecommuting can improve productivity when it is carried out in a quiet environment. Our work adds to this stream of literature by
demonstrating an unexpected social issue of fairness arising from this operating model.

3.

Theory Development

A researcher’s productivity can be measured as the product of the amount of time he or she
can dedicate to research, Time Available for Research, and how efficiently he or she conducts
research, Research Efficiency. This definition is consistent with the key insights from the literature
that productivity is determined by two elements: (1) the capacity constraint due to physical or
cognitive limitations and (2) efficiency variations with changes in operations factors in the working
environment (KC 2019).
For many researchers, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected their productivity both in terms of
time available for research and research efficiency. In response to the pandemic, most countries have
closed schools and daycare centers and required that their citizens to be quarantined at home. As
a result, researchers from more than 1,100 colleges and universities had to carry out both work and
household duties at home (National Conference of State Legislatures 2020). We next illustrate how

Cui, Ding, Zhu:

the disruptions change researchers’ time available for research and research efficiency separately.
We then argue how these changes might be unequal among female and male researchers.
The pandemic changes researchers’ working environment, resulting in a need to reallocate their
time across research, work-related tasks (such as commuting, social interaction, and service to
the academic community), and home-related tasks (such as childcare and house chores). Certain
tasks have an in-person nature, such as commuting to the office, serving administrative duties, and
interacting socially with colleagues. These tasks are significantly reduced during the lockdown and
the time savings could be substantial; for example, workers in the US on average spend an hour
commuting each work day (United States Census Bureau 2018). During the pandemic, researchers
could use this additional capacity for research. At the same time, they might have to allocate more
time to home-related tasks. Even without the pandemic, working from home constantly exposes
researchers to the home environment and home duties. During the lockdown, to make matters
worse, many services and amenities such as schools, day-care centers, hospitals, and restaurants
have either been closed or operating at a lower capacity. Researchers might need to allocate extra
time to domestic duties. For example, childcare could be particularly time-demanding since parents
have diminished access to their regular childcare support network, such as professional caregivers,
relatives, and friends. Consequently, researchers who are responsible for more house works and
childcare are more likely to allocate additional time to domestic duties. In conclusion, a researcher
could have either more or less time available due to the pandemic, which depends on the new
allocation of home responsibilities.
Besides the time available for research, the pandemic affects drivers of research efficiency, such
as multitasking, task sequence, fatigue, and peer effects. Conducting scientific work often requires
hours of interruption-free environment. When working from home, although researchers are not distracted by activities like commuting, administrative duties, and social interactions with colleagues,
they are likely to be distracted by childcare and housework, resulting in excessive multitasking.
Multitasking means that workers have to allocate their limited cognitive capacity across multiple
tasks. The setup cost associated with switching between tasks and the difficulty of focusing on
and organizing relevant information hinder efficiency (KC 2014). Multitasking has also been shown
to induce stress and frustration (Mark et al. 2008), make people more easily distracted (Levitin
2014), and exhaust their cognitive capacity (KC 2014). Home duties and urgency often require
researchers’ immediate attention, forcing them to deviate from their optimal task sequences, which
would in turn reduce their research efficiency. Researchers may also encounter a heavier workload
from increased housework and thus experience fatigue, which could also reduce efficiency. Last but
not least, working from home makes it difficult to observe one’s colleagues’ productivity and to
discuss research topics with their peers, both of which reduce the positive influence of peers in

8

motivating researchers, inspiring research ideas, and improving efficiency (Song et al. 2018, Tan
and Netessine 2019). In conclusion, a researcher’s research efficiency could go up and down due to
the pandemic, depending on the level of impact they get from multitasking, fatigue, altered task
sequence, and altered peer effects.
We next demonstrate how the changes in research time and efficiency can be different for women
and men. Women are on average, disproportionately burdened with childcare and household responsibilities (Bianchi et al. 2012). In the US, they are shown to spend almost twice as much time as
men on housework and childcare in the US (Bianchi et al. 2012). Moreover, there are 8.5 million
more single mothers than single fathers (Alon et al. 2020). Even in the gender-egalitarian countries
of northern Europe, women are responsible for almost two-thirds of the unpaid work (European
Commission 2016). Among heterosexual couples with female breadwinners, women still do most of
the care work (Chesley and Flood 2017). The same pattern exists in academia (Schiebinger and
Gilmartin 2010, Andersen et al. 2020). Female professors are shown to spend more time doing
housework and carework than male professors across various ranks; for example, 34.1 hours per
week versus 27.6 hours for lecturers, 29.6 hours per week versus 25.1 hours for assistant professors,
and 37.7 hours per week versus 24.5 hours for associate professors (Misra et al. 2012).
The unequal distribution of domestic duties means that the pandemic might affect female and
male researchers’ productivity unequally. First, in terms of time available for research, female
researchers are likely to reallocate more time to domestic duties due to the pandemic than male
researchers do, leaving them with less capacity for research. Second, in terms of efficiency, female
researchers are more likely to be disrupted by multitasking between research and home-related
tasks and consequently deviate from their optimal task sequences. Taken these factors together,
female researchers tend to suffer more from a reduced amount of time available for research and
diminished efficiency compared to male researchers, which suggests a disadvantage in women’s
productivity during the pandemic. We therefore hypothesize that, during the pandemics, female
researchers are likely to have lower productivity than male researchers.

Data and Summary Statistics

We collect data from the Social Security Research Network (SSRN), a repository of preprints
with the objective of rapidly disseminating scholarly research in social science. We gather data
on all social science preprints submitted from December 2018 to May 2019 and from December
2019 to May 2020. We extract information on paper titles and the authors’ names, affiliations,
and addresses. We use the authors’ addresses to identify their countries. The COVID-19 outbreak
began at different times in different countries, so we collect each country’s lockdown start date from

Cui, Ding, Zhu:

news sources and a United Nations report.2 We drop authors without addresses or with addresses
in more than one country because we cannot determine when these authors were affected by the
lockdown. We also drop countries with fewer than 800 submissions during our study period. The
final data set consist of a total of 41,858 papers in 18 disciplines produced by 76,832 authors from
25 countries.
To identify the authors’ genders, we first use a database called Genderize,3 which predicts gender
based on first name and provides a confidence level. About 78 percent of the authors’ genders
were identified with confidence levels over 80 percent. For the remaining authors, we use Amazon
Mechanical Turk to manually search for their professional webpages based on names and affiliations
and then infer their genders from their profile photos. Our dataset contains 21,733 female academics
and 55,099 male academics.
We aggregate the number of new preprints at the weekly level. We then count the number of
papers uploaded by each author in each week. To measure the effective productivity for preprints
with multiple authors, when a preprint has n authors, each author gets a publication count of 1/n.4
Finally, we aggregate the effective number of papers to the gender level: in each week, we count
the total number of papers produced by male and female authors separately in each social science
discipline.
Figure 1 plots the time trend of preprints in aggregation from December 3, 2019 to May 19,
2020 in the US. The vertical line represents the week of March 11, 2020, on which nationwide
lockdown measures began in the US.5 We can observe that male academics, on average, have
submitted more preprints than female academics, and that female and male academics’ research
productivity evolved in parallel before the lockdown. After the lockdown started, however, male
academics significantly boosted their productivity, whereas female academics’ productivity did not
change much, indicating an increased productivity gap.
To ensure that our results are not driven by seasonality, we plot the time trend of preprints
during the same time window in 2019 in Appendix Figure A.1. We observe a similar pattern before
the week of March 11, 2019, but there is no significant change in the productivity gap after that
week.
We use authors’ professional information to identify academic ranks (e.g., PhD student or assistant, associate or full professor). Specifically, we ask workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk to find

each researcher’s curriculum vitae or professional webpage. To study how the pandemic affects
researchers with different academic ranks, we categorize researchers into students (which includes
PhD and postdoctoral students), assistant professors, associate professors, and full professors,
each accounting for 20.3 percent, 16.1 percent, 19.7 percent, and 44.0 percent of the population,
respectively. Next, we use authors’ affiliations to classify the ranking of their universities. To ascertain whether the productivity gap is intensified or weakened across top-ranked and lower-ranked
research universities, we collect social science research rankings from three sources: QS University
Ranking,6 Times Higher Education,7 and Academic Ranking of World University.8 We then use
these data to rank US universities in order to study the heterogeneous effects across university
rankings.
Table 1 reports the summary statistics for the weekly number of preprints by gender and discipline from December 3, 2019 to May 19, 2020, spanning 24 weeks, as well as split-sample statistics
prior to or after the lockdown. This sample includes 9,943 preprints produced by 15,494 authors in
the US and 21,065 preprints produced by 37,997 authors across all countries. The average number
of submissions per week is 444.6 in the US and 877.7 across all 25 countries. Notably, while research

productivity in the US increased by 35 percent after the lockdown, male authors seem to be the
main contributors to this increase.
About 78 percent of the preprints fall under multiple disciplines.9 Note that when computing
the total preprints, we count the paper only once when aggregating across disciplines to avoid
multiple counting. When computing the number of preprints in each discipline, we separately count
all of the papers classified under each one. We observe substantial variations across disciplines.
Among the 18 disciplines, Political Science, Economics, and Law received the most submissions,
whereas Geography, Criminal Justice and Education the fewest. While there was a large increase in
productivity in several disciplines, such as Economics, Political Science, Finance, Health Economics,
and Sustainability, after the COVID-19 outbreak, other disciplines showed no obvious increase.
A few disciplines, such as Anthropology, Cognitive, and Information Systems, even experienced a
decline.

The table summarizes the weekly number of papers from December 2019 to May 2020. The sample includes 15,494 authors from
the United States and 37,997 authors across all countries. There are 9,934 preprints produced by US authors, 2,493 of which
are produced by 3,877 female researchers and 7,441 by 11,617 male researchers. We gather the country-specific lockdown time
to split our sample to before and after the lockdown for each country.

Authors self-classify their own preprints into disciplines when they upload their papers. SSRN reviews and approves

Gender Inequality in Research Productivity

Identification

Our identification exploits the lockdown in response to the COVID-19 outbreak as an exogenous
shock that has caused substantial disruption to academic activities, requiring academics to teach,
conduct research, and carry out household duties at home. The validity of our approach depends on
the assumption that the shock is exogenous with respect to the researchers’ anticipated responses.
If a particular gender group of researchers anticipated and strategically prepared for the shock by
accelerating the completion of their research papers, this could confound the treatment effect. In
reality, this possibility is unlikely because of the rapid development of the situation. COVID-19 was
regarded as a low risk and not a threat to the US in late January (Moreno 2020), and no significant
actions had been taken other than travel warnings issued until late February (Franck 2020). It
quickly turned into a global pandemic after the declaration of the World Health Organization on
March 11, 2020, followed by the nationwide shelter-in-place orders within a week.10
We adopt the difference-in-differences (DID) methodology, a common approach used to evaluate
people’s or organizations’ responses to natural shocks (e.g., Seamans and Zhu 2013, Calvo et al.
2019). We perform the DID analysis using outcome variables on two levels: the number of preprints
in each discipline and the number of preprints aggregated across all disciplines.11
We compare the productivity gap between female and male researchers before and after the
pandemic outbreak using the following model specification with discipline-level panel data:
log(P reprintsigt ) = c + F emaleg + βF emaleg × Lockdownt + γt + δi + igt ,

(1)

where i denotes discipline, g denotes the gender group, t denotes the week, log(P reprintsigt )
represents the logged number of preprints uploaded for discipline i for gender g during week t, γt is
the time fixed effect, δi is the discipline fixed effect that captures the time-invariant characteristics
of discipline i, and igt is the error term. The time fixed effect γt includes weekly time dummies
that control for time trends. The dummy variable F emaleg equals 1 if gender g is female, and 0
otherwise. The dummy variable Lockdownt equals 1 if week t occurs after the lockdown measure
was adopted (that is, the week of March 11, 2020), and 0 otherwise. Its main effect is absorbed by
the time fixed effects. The coefficient β estimates the effect of the lockdown on female academics’
research productivity relative to male academics’ productivity.
We also use aggregate-level data to estimate the effect with the following DID specification:
log(P reprintsgt ) = c + F emaleg + βF emaleg × Lockdownt + γt + gt ,

We also perform a DID analysis with the country-level panel data. For this, we assign a lockdown dummy to each
country and combine data across countries to form a country-level panel. This analysis yields consistent results.

Empirical Results

In this section, we report the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on research productivity. We first
show the average effect of the pandemic on gender inequality. We then show the heterogeneous
effects across academic disciplines, faculty ranks, university rankings, and countries.
6.1.

Main Results

Table 2 reports the estimates with the discipline fixed effect using Equation (1). Table 3 reports
the estimated effect of the pandemic shock on research productivity at the aggregate level using
Equation (2). In each analysis, we use 14 weeks before the lockdown as the pre-treatment period
and 6 to 10 weeks after the lockdown as the post-treatment periods. The analyses yield consistent
results. First, in line with our summary statistics, the results show that fewer preprints are produced
by female academics than by male academics in general. Second, since the lockdown began, there
has been a significant reduction in female academics’ productivity relative to that of their male
colleagues, indicating an exacerbated productivity gap in gender. The coefficient of the interaction
term in Column (5) suggests a 13.2-percent reduction in females’ productivity over the 10-week
period after the lockdown relative to the males’.12

6.2.1.

Effects across academic rank. We study how the pandemic affects researchers with

different academic ranks (such as PhD student, or assistant, associate or full professor). Because
assistant professors often face more pressure than senior professors to publish papers in order to get
tenure, they are more motivated to devote as much time as possible to research. They are also at
a stage at which many have young children. As a result, the pandemic’s effect on the productivity
gap is likely to be more pronounced for this group. We repeat the DID analysis for each academic
rank and report results based on Equations (1) and (2) in Table 4 and Table A.3, respectively. The
two tables show consistent results.
Table 4 shows that female assistant professors experienced the most significant drop in research
productivity (compared to male junior faculty) since the lockdown. In contrast, the gender gaps
for senior academics and for postdoctoral students are insignificant. Note that PhD and postdoctoral students, who are less likely to be married or have children relative to assistant professors,
might experience equal distractions from household duties and thus experience the same change
in research capacity across genders, which explains the insignificant gender inequality among this
group.

Effects across university ranking. Table 5 replicates the DID analysis using Equa-

tion (1) for a subset of academics based on the rankings of their universities.13 Due to our focus on
social science, we use the 2020 QS World University Ranking for social sciences and management
for the main analysis. We separately analyze academics in universities ranked in the top 10, 20,...,
and 100. The results show that the COVID-19 effect is more pronounced in top-tier universities and
that this effect in general decreases and becomes less significant as we include more lower-ranked
universities. We find similar results when using the two other rankings, as shown in Appendix
Table A.1.

This table reports the estimated coefficients based on Equation (2) at the aggregate level for
universities within each rank group. The coefficients for 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 weeks since the
lockdown are presented in Columns (1)–(5), respectively. Time fixed effects at the weekly level
are included in each regression. Standard errors and estimates of other variables are omitted for
brevity. Significance at ∗ p < 0.1; ∗∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

As with junior faculty, researchers in higher-ranked universities often face more pressure for
tenure and therefore devote more time to research. The constraint caused by the pandemic therefore
has a bigger impact on researchers from top-tier universities, resulting in a greater gender inequality
among them.
6.2.3.

Effects across countries. Finally, we examine how the estimated gender inequality

varies across countries by replicating the analysis for academics in each country. Figure 2 illustrates
the impact on the productivity gap graphically by plotting the estimates of the interacted term
with 90-percent and 95-percent confidence intervals; a negative value represents a drop in female
academics’ research productivity relative to that of male academics. We can observe that most
countries—21 out of 25 countries—have experienced a decline in female researchers’ productivity.
In addition to the US, six countries have shown statistically significant declines: Japan, China,
Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Note that because SSRN is primarily

used by US researchers, its preprints for other countries might be limited, which might weaken our
ability to detect changes.

This graph plots the estimates of the interacted term with 90-percent and 95-percent confidence intervals in each country. The
negative values represent female academics’ research productivity drop relative to that of male academics.

Robustness Checks

In this section, we report the results of several robustness tests. Specifically, we check the parallel
trends assumption and conduct falsification tests to ensure that our estimated effects are not
idiosyncratic. We also test gender inequality in research quality, examine the co-authorship issue,
and rule out the data censoring concern.
7.1.

Parallel trends

The key identification assumption for the DID estimation is the parallel trends assumption; namely,
that before the COVID-19 shock, female and male researchers’ productivity would follow the same

Cui, Ding, Zhu:

17

Gender Inequality in Research Productivity

time trend. In Appendix Figure A.1, which presents the time trends of preprints in 2019, visual
inspection shows the two genders’ parallel evolution before the shock. We then test this assumption
by performing an analysis similar to that of Seamans and Zhu (2013) and Calvo et al. (2019), in
which we expand Equation (1) to estimate the treatment effect week by week before the shock.
Specifically, we replace Lockdownt in Equation (2) with the dummy variable T imetτ , where τ ∈
{−14, −13, ..., −2, −1, 0} and T imetτ = 1 if τ = t and 0 otherwise, indicating the relative τ th week

The benchmark group is the week of the pandemic outbreak. The coefficients β−14 to β−1 identify
any week-by-week pre-treatment difference between the female and male researchers, which we
expect to be insignificant. We then repeat the same analysis with our aggregate-level data.
Appendix Table A.2 presents the estimation results. They show no pre-treatment differences in
the research productivity trends of female and male academics, which supports the parallel trends
assumption.
7.2.

Falsification test

To show that our estimate effects are not an artifact of seasonality, we test whether such a decline
in female productivity also occurred in 2019. Appendix Table A.5 reports the summary statistics
in 2019. We repeat the same analysis specified in Equation (2) using data in 2019 for the same
time window used in 2020. If our results simply capture seasonality, we would be able to find
significant effects in 2019. Appendix Table A.6 reports the falsification test results. The placebotreated average treatment effects are insignificant, implying that women’s productivity did not
decline significantly in the previous year.
7.3.

Research Quality

So far, we study the research quantity— using Number of Preprints as the dependent variable.
One might question whether the difference in productivity is because, since the lockdown began,
male researchers increased the volume of their production at the expense of quality. If this is true,
the relative quality of female researchers’ preprints should have increased since the lockdown. We
test this possibility using data on how many times the abstract has been viewed and the preprint
has been downloaded for each preprint, the two primary quality indicators used by SSRN to rank
preprints. Appendix Table A.7 reports the summary statistics of these two variables. We compare
the average number of abstract views per preprint and the average number of downloads per

using the same specification as in Equation (1) with the discipline fixed effect:
log(Abstract V iewsgt or Downloadsgt ) = c+F emaleg +βF emaleg × Lockdownt +γt +δi +igt . (4)
Tables 6 and 7 report the the effect of the lockdown on the number of abstract views and
the number of downloads, respectively. In general, the average treatment effects are insignificant,
suggesting that after the lockdown, female and male researchers’ research quality did not change
significantly, and that our findings are unlikely to be driven by shifts in research quality. In addition,
column (4) and (5) of Table 7 suggest that female researchers’ research quality in terms of the
number of downloads per preprint decreased compared to male researchers’ after the lockdown.
We repeat our analysis using Equation 2 and find consistent results. The estimation results are
reported in Appendix Tables A.8 and A.9.
7.4.

Coauthorship

We next study how coauthorship across gender affects our results. Recall that we measure the
effective productivity for preprints with n authors by allocating 1/n preprint to each coauthor.

Cui, Ding, Zhu:

19

Gender Inequality in Research Productivity

That is, our measure implicitly assumes equal productivity across female and male authors. To
alleviate the concern that this assumption may not hold, we conduct a sub-sample analysis focusing
on preprints that have either all-male or all-female authors, excluding preprints that have both
male and female authors. We repeat our DID analysis for this sub-sample using Equations (1)
and (2) to compare the productivity gap between all-male and all-female preprints.
Table 8 reports the estimation results with the discipline fixed effect using Equation (1). The
results show that the number of all-female preprints has significantly dropped since the lockdown,
compared to all-male preprints. Note that the coefficients of F emale × Lockdown in Table 8 are
more significant and larger than those in Table 2, suggesting that gender inequality is more pronounced when a research team has only female authors. Intuitively, an all-female research team’s
capacity is more severely constrained, resulting in a lower productivity. Table A.4 reports the
results at the aggregate-level and the results are consistent.

7.5.

Data Censoring

One might be concerned that because research takes time, many researchers only post one preprint
during our sample period. As a result, our data sample before and after the lockdown may contain
a different set of authors.
To address this concern, we perform two analyses. First, we collect additional data on US authors,
extending the time window of our main analysis to 40 weeks. By adding 16 weeks to the posttreatment period, we capture more researchers in our sample, especially those who were not able
to post preprints within 10 weeks of the lockdown. We repeat the DID analysis and find consistent
results.
Second, we construct a balanced panel by including only authors who posted preprints before
the lockdown to compare the productivity of the same group of authors before and after the

20

Cui, Ding, Zhu:

Gender Inequality in Research Productivity

lockdown. This approach ensures an apple-to-apple comparison and helps us rule out potential
biases introduced by different author samples in the pre-treatment and post-treatment periods.
Table 9 reports the estimated results using the balanced panel. The findings are consistent with
our main results: within the same group of authors, female researchers’ productivity dropped
significantly after the lockdown compared to male researchers’ productivity.

Conclusions

Our paper adds to the long-standing literature on gender equality, an important topic in social
science. For example, the literature has shown evidence of fairness in parental leaves (Lundquist
et al. 2012) and inequality in tenure evaluation (Sarsons 2017, Antecol et al. 2018), recognition
(Ghiasi et al. 2015), and compensation (Pierce et al. 2020). Researchers have also investigated
business innovations to help empower women (Plambeck and Ramdas 2020). The COVID-19 crisis
brings to the forefront a long existing issue: the inequities faced by women who often do more
of the childcare and housework. We contribute to the literature by providing direct tests of the
impact of the pandemic shock on gender inequality in academia.
We show that in the US, since the lockdown began, women have produced 13.2–13.9-percent
fewer social science research papers than men. We also find that the effect is especially significant
for junior faculty and for researchers at top-ranked universities. Finally, we find that the increase
in productivity inequality is significant in seven countries. The results are robust when we repeat
our analysis over papers with same-gender authors, a balanced sample with the same group of
authors before and after the lockdown, and an extended data sample.
Our findings indicate that, if the lockdown is kept in place for too long, female academics
in junior positions and at top-ranked universities are likely to be significantly disadvantaged—a
fairness issue that may expose women to a higher unemployment or career risk in the future. We
hope our findings increase awareness of this issue. Actions could be taken to balance domestic

responsibilities among spouses. Recently, many universities have taken actions such as granting
tenure clock extensions to both female and male faculty. Recall that our paper finds an overall
35-percent increase in productivity and a 13-percent increase in gender gap among social science
researchers. Therefore, our findings do not provoke a concern for overall productivity but rather
for gender inequality. As a result, universities could consider providing additional support, such as
childcare support, to female researchers whose productivity has been disproportionately affected.
Universities and letter writers should keep this inequality in mind when evaluating professors for
promotion. We also hope our work will inspire researchers to explore other forms of inequality
arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our findings also suggest that telecommuting may have unintended consequences for gender
inequality. As the COVID-19 outbreak accelerates the trend toward telecommuting, institutions
and firms should take gender equality into consideration when designing and implementing telecommuting policies. We hope that our work could serve as a stepping stone to stimulate more research
on the synergy between operations and social issues.
Our study has a few limitations. First, since it focuses on social science disciplines, and thus the
findings may not be generalizable to other disciplines. Second, we have limited information about
the researchers in our dataset. Future research could collect additional data—such as parental
status, whether they are allocating more or less time to research than they did before the pandemic, whether they multitask at home, and who performs household duties—to pinpoint the exact
mechanism underlying the observed empirical patterns.

The table summarizes the weekly number of papers from December 2018 to May 2019. In total, there are 9,333 preprints
produced by 14,767 US authors, 2,413 of which are produced by 3,876 female researchers and 6,920 are produced by 10,891 male
researchers. We gather the country-specific lockdown time to split our sample to before and after the lockdown for each country.

This table reports the estimated coefficients of the interacted term, Female × Lockdown, in Equation (2). The coefficients for 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 weeks since the lockdown are presented in columns
(1)–(5), respectively. Note that we omit reporting estimates of other variables for brevity. Time
fixed effects at the weekly level are included in all regressions. Significance at ∗ p < 0.1; ∗∗ p < 0.05;
∗∗∗
p < 0.01.
