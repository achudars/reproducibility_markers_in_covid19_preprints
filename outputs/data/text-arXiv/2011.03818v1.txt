Abstract Background. The evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic has been accompanied
by efforts to provide comparable international data on new cases and deaths. There is
also accumulating evidence on the epidemiological parameters underlying COVID-19.
Hence there is potential for epidemic models providing mid-term forecasts of the
epidemic trajectory using such information. The effectiveness of lockdown or lockdown
relaxation can also be assessed by modelling later epidemic stages, possibly using a
multiphase epidemic model. Methods. Commonly applied methods to analyze epidemic
trajectories or make forecasts include phenomenological growth models (e.g. the
Richards family of densities), and variants of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)
compartment model. Here we focus on a practical forecasting approach, applied to
interim UK COVID data, using a bivariate Reynolds model (for cases and deaths), with
implementation based on Bayesian inference. We show the utility of informative priors in
developing and estimating the model, and compare error densities (Poisson-gamma,
Poisson-lognormal, Poisson-logStudent) for overdispersed data on new cases and
deaths. We use cross-validation to assess medium term forecasts. We also consider
the longer term post-lockdown epidemic profile to assess epidemic containment, using a
two phase model. Results. Fit to interim mid-epidemic data shows better fit to training
data and better cross validation performance for a Poisson-logStudent model.
Estimation of longer term epidemic data after lockdown relaxation, characterised by
protracted slow downturn and then upturn in cases, casts doubt on effective
containment. Conclusions. Many applications of phenomenological models have been
to complete epidemics. However, evaluation of such models based simply on their fit to
observed data may give only a partial picture, and cross-validation against actual trends
is also valuable. Similarly, it may be preferable to model incidence rather than
cumulative data, though this raises questions about suitable error densities for
modelling often erratic fluctuations. Hence there may be utility in evaluating alternative
error assumptions.
1. Introduction
Epidemic forecasts have been an essential element in policy decisions regarding the
COVID-19 epidemic, such as lockdown imposition and relaxation. Forecasting has been
assisted by well-organized efforts to provide international data on new cases and
deaths. These include the daily updated comparative data provided by the European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)
(https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data), and monitoring profiles provided by
John Hopkins University [1]. There is also a growing literature providing evidence on the
parameters of the COVID-19 infection (for example, case fatality ratios, serial intervals,

etc). Hence the potential occurs for epidemic models that are applicable to routinely
collected data, that make use of accumulated evidence, and can provide forecasts for
epidemics observed at mid-stage. Policy decisions in many countries (imposition of
lockdowns, and later relaxation) have been made based on trends in observed numbers
of cases and deaths, while admitting these may be subject to measurement error - for
example, identified cases may understate total numbers infected; there are fluctuations
in daily new cases due to variation in daily testing; and there may be COVID-19
diagnostic errors.
Commonly applied approaches to quantitative modelling of aggregate epidemic data
differ in the data inputs they require, their assumptions, their estimability, and in their
scope for practical application to making forecasts. Commonly applied methods include
phenomenological growth models [2], such as the Richards family of densities [3], and
variants of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartment model [4].
Phenomenological models are parameterised in terms of epidemic trajectories and
provide estimates of crucial epidemiological parameters [5], while avoiding the
complexity of more formal models of disease transmission which can be difficult to
estimate and provide projections [4,6]. As mentioned by Wu et al [7], phenomenological
models are "particularly suitable when significant uncertainty clouds the epidemiology of
an infectious disease". By contrast, as noted in [8], compartmental transmission models
may be based on untested assumptions such as random mixing between all individuals
in a given population, may be sensitive to starting assumptions, and may provide
estimates that differ considerably between models. Such models often rely on preset
parameters, which may mean prediction uncertainty is understated. They may also be
complex to specify when an epidemic has more than one phase.
Here we focus on a practical forecasting approach using routinely available data on new
cases and deaths (from ECDC) to estimate parameters of a bivariate version of the
Reynolds model. Implementation is based on Bayesian inference principles,
incorporating accumulated evidence on relevant parameters via informative priors. The
operation and utility of this approach is demonstrated using data on new cases and
deaths in the United Kingdom (UK), with a focus on predictive accuracy for 20-day
ahead forecasts of cases and deaths, based on mid-epidemic data. Other policy
relevant parameters such as the effective reproduction ratio are also estimated in
analysis of longer term epidemic data.
2. Related Research
A number of studies, with widely differing methodologies, have been made which
forecast different aspects of the COVID epidemic or related health care need. In its
impact on policy making in the UK and US, perhaps most influential has been the
Imperial College model [9]. This is based on microsimulation with transmission through
contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals in various settings, or randomly
in the community, depending on spatial distance between contacts. A number of
epidemic parameters (e.g. incubation periods and basic reproduction numbers) are
preset. Forecasts are provided for deaths and hospital beds. Also providing forecasts
across countries is the model of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [8]. This

has no underlying representation of epidemic dynamics, but is based on fitting a
hierarchical parametric model for observed cumulative death rates in different countries,
and then projecting these forward.
Various types of time series forecast have also been made, using ARIMA models [10,
11], exponential smoothing [12], or autoregression in cases; for example, the study by
Johndron et al [13] postulates daily deaths as a lagged function of earlier new cases.
Autoregression in cases, with potential for short term forecasting, is illustrated (for foot
and mouth disease) by the first order autoregressive model of Lawson et al [14], while
(for multiple spatial units) the model of Bracher and Held [15] specifies a first order
autoregression based on the mean incidence in adjacent areas.
Regarding phenomenological models, the study by Zhao et al [5] exemplifies their
application to epidemic forecasting, though to the Zika epidemic in 2015 rather than the
COVID-19 epidemic. Applications of such models to COVID-19 include [16] and [17].
3. Methods
3.1 Phenomenological Models
Basic phenomenological models for epidemic trajectories include the logistic, Gompertz,
and Rosenzweig, which have been the basis for a range of generalizations [2, 3].
Application of the logistic model to COVID-19 is exemplified by the studies of Batista
[18] and Shen [19]. For time t , the logistic model for new cases C ′ t and
cumulative cases Ct
Ct

is

is the maximum number of cases (final epidemic size), r  0 measures
the intensity of exponential growth in cases in the early epidemic phase, and  L is
the inflection point where new cases are highest. The Richards model [20] modifies the
logistic incidence function to
where K

2

.

The parameter a  0 modifies the incidence decline phase of the logistic, that is
measures the extent of deviation from the standard logistic curve. The turning point  ,
when incidence peaks, is obtained when Ct equals K1  a −1/a [21]. The peak
incidence is important for the healthcare planning, for example aligning the forecast
peak with hospital bed capacity [22].
Other commonly used models are the Gompertz model [23] with

C ′ t  rCt logK/Ct,
while the Rosenzweig [24] has

C ′ t  rCt

Ct

−1 .

The incidence function represented by C ′ t can be used to define mean incidence in
statistical likelihoods for new cases data. Thus time series of incidence counts can often
be satisfactorily modelled as a Poisson, with means defined by C ′ t functions [25,
26]. Similarly the cumulative cases function Ct can be used to define mean
epidemic size in models for cumulative case counts [24, 27].
It may be preferable to estimate epidemic model parameters by analyzing new cases
rather than cumulative cases, as the latter have serially correlated measurement error,
leading to understatement of parameter uncertainty [28]. As stated in [28],
"independence of sequential measurement errors, ... is clearly violated when
observations are accumulated through time". However, estimation using new cases and
deaths puts a much greater focus on how to deal with stochastic variation in the data.
For daily data, fluctuations in new events may be considerable, whereas cumulative
cases and deaths are usually smooth functions.
While for smaller epidemics, a Poisson density for mean incidence may be applied, for
larger epidemics such as COVID-19, a negative binomial density is often preferred, both
because of large incidence counts, and to represent often erratic incidence fluctuations
that lead to overdispersion relative to the Poisson [28]. Other overdispersed versions of
the Poisson can be achieved by mixing the Poisson with a suitable density (e.g. a
lognormal density) [29,30], and this may be beneficial in detecting unusual
observations.
3.2 Model Specification: Poisson Overdispersion
Consider the Richards model parameters. Let ct and C t denote incidence and
cumulative incidence counts at times t  1, . . . , T (days in the case of COVID data
from ECDC). We condition on the first case or cases (i.e. the first observation), and take
incidence at time t as a function of cumulative cases at t − 1 , so that for a Poisson
model we have
ct  Poisson t 
t  2, . . . , T.
 t  rC t−1 1 − C t−1 /K a ,
In practice many epidemic datasets are overdispersed relative to the Poisson, and
many studies adopt a negative binomial model instead. We can specify an
overdispersed model (including the negative binomial) by introducing multiplicative
random effects [29, eqn 2], such that the Poisson means for incidence are specified by
 t  rC t−1 1 − C t−1 /K a  t ,
3

where the  t

are positive random effects. For the Poisson-gamma model (equivalent

to a Negative Binomial), the  t
 t  Gamma, ,

are gamma distributed with mean 1, namely

where 1/ is the overdispersion parameter mentioned by [28]. Note that the assumed
parameterisation of the gamma density with random variable x is
px|a, b 

ba
Γa

xa−1 e−bx .

Other options in (3) are to take u t  log t  as normally distributed [29]
u t  Normal0,  2 ,
or Student t distributed [31],
u t  Student - t0,  2 , 
where  is a degrees of freedom parameter. These two options define the
Poisson-Lognormal (PLN) and Poisson-log-Student (PLS) options respectively [30]. The
PLN and PLS representations may provide a more robust alternative to the
Poisson-gamma [31, 32, 33, 34, 35], as their tails are heavier than for the gamma
distribution, and have been found to be better at accommodating outliers (such as daily
"spikes" in an epidemic application).
3.3 A Joint Model for New Cases and New Deaths
In the analysis below we apply a bivariate estimation with both new cases and deaths
modelled using the Richards specification. Thus denote d t and D t as new and
cumulative deaths at time t. The joint likelihood for an overdispersed Poisson model for
both outcomes then specifies
ct  Poisson ct ,
d t  Poisson dt ,
 ct  rc C t−1 1 − C t−1 /K c  a c  ct ,
 dt  r d D t−1 1 − D t−1 /K d  a d  dt ,

4
t  2, . . . , T.

5

For a Bayesian application, we need to specify prior densities, or priors for short, for the
parameters. For the epidemic size parameter K c , a diffuse prior confined to positive
values, such as a diffuse gamma density - for example Ga1,  or G,  , with 
small - was found to lead to convergence problems. As noted in [18],"... in the early
stage, the logistic curve follows an exponential growth curve, so the estimation of K
is practically impossible". This difficulty persists when an epidemic is past its peak but
early in a downturn. However, Batista [18] mentions a relationship (for the logistic
model) between successive cumulative case counts that may assist in providing a prior
for K c . Specifically for three points spaced m time units apart, one may obtain the
relationship for a point estimator of K c , namely
K ec 

C t−m C t−2m C t−m −2C t−2m C t C t−m C t 
C 2t−m −C t C t−2m 

.

One may use this point estimator to define a prior mean for K c

in the Richards model

(which is a generalisation of the logistic). Specifically, one may take a lognormal density
e
prior for K c , with logK c  as mean, and a suitable variance, such that the prior is
still relatively diffuse. For example, suppose K ec is 250000, and the variance in the
lognormal is set at 1. Then the 97.5 percentile for the lognormal prior is 1.73 million.
In the bivariate specification (for new cases and deaths jointly), we seek to share prior
information between outcomes. One option for the prior on K d (the final death total)
is as a function of K c , namely
K d  K c ,
where  is a form of case fatality ratio (CFR). An informative prior for  could be
based on the COVID experience in similar countries, or on experience of epidemics of
similar diseases. Considering the first option, and an appropriate prior for analysing UK
data, an informative prior for  could be provided by the case fatality ratio across the
European Union (the UK being no longer an EU member). International information on
case fatality is provided at
https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#the-current-case-fatality-rate-of-covid-19.
Alternatively one may link K c and K d using both the point estimator K ec and a
e
e
case fatality ratio, namely K d  K c . Then a lognormal density prior can be taken for
logK ec   log
K d , with logK ed  
that the prior is still relatively diffuse.

as the mean, and a suitable variance such

Another possible prior to link ultimate cases and deaths would involve a time series in
2
time-specific case fatality ratios, such as an autoregression  t  N t−1 ,    , with  t
estimated from cumulative data on deaths and cases. Some analyses of epidemics
show that the CFR early in an epidemic may underestimate later values [36], in which
case the prior on  may be constrained to exceed the final  t based on observed
data. With regard to COVID-19 not all epidemics fit this pattern, with the US (for
example) showing a decline in CFRs at later epidemic stages. There is also evidence
that the infection to mortality ratio (a more precise measure than the CFR) has fallen
[37].To allow for such a scenario, the prior for  could be centred at the last
observed  t ,

rather than constrained to exceed it.

Joint priors on other parameters could be considered, for example, bivariate normal
priors on the logs of r c and r d , or on the logs of a c and a d . In the empirical
analysis below we focus on priors linking the final epidemic and death total parameters,
K c and K d , as these are an important influence on forecasts.
3.4 Medium Term Forecasts
Many applications of phenomenological models are to historic data on epidemics, where

the epidemic has run to its full extent. Here we consider applications to incomplete
epidemics (e.g. epidemics observed to their mid point or early in the downturn), and to
forecasts using such data. Forecasts at an intermediate point within the observation
span are of interest in themselves for policy purposes. However, they can also be used
in comparative model evaluation by using cross-validation, with only some data used for
estimating the model, and some held out for validation.
Thus suppose the training sample is formed by observations up to time M  T, while
the F subsequent observations at times t  M  1, . . . , M  F (where M  F ≤ T
are used as a validation sample. Predictions cnew,M1 and d new,M1 for new cases
and deaths at time M  1 are based on observed cumulative counts C M and D M
. As usual in Bayesian inference, predictions are obtained as replicate data sampled
from the posterior predictive densities
pd new |Y 


 pd new |Y, d

pcnew |Y 

 pcnew |Y, d

and

where Y  c, d are data on new cases and deaths, and

are parameters in the joint model of section 3.3 [38].

Predicted cumulative counts at time M  1 are then obtained as
C new,M1  C new,M  cnew,M1 and D newM1  D new,M  d new,M1 . Predicted new cases
and deaths at M  2 , cnew,M2 and d newM2 , are then sampled from the
appropriate phenomenological model form, with predicted new cases and deaths at
M  2 based on C new,M1 and D new,M1 . Cumulated cases and deaths at M  2
are then obtained by adding predicted new cases and deaths for M  2 to C new,M1
and D new,M1 . This process is continued until time M  F.
Fit can be assessed by whether credible intervals for predictions in the cross-validation
period include actual incidence and new deaths. Also relevant are probabilities of over
or under-prediction. For example, consider predicted new cases cnew,s,t for the
validation period t  M  1, . . . , M  F,

and for MCMC samples s  1, . . . , S , and let
average new predicted cases during the validation period (the average over F days)
at iteration s be denoted cnew,s,T1:TF . We want to compare average predicted new
cases with average actual new cases, cT1:TF , during the validation period.
Probabilities of overprediction can be obtained from binary indicators

where IA  1 if condition A is true, and IA  0 otherwise. Thus at each
iteration we compare average new cases (modelled) during the validation period with

overprediction, while  c under 0.05 indicates a high probability of underprediction.
Underprediction means under-forecasting of future cases and may lead to incorrect
inferences regarding epidemic control, as it implies a lessening in incidence earlier than
actually occurred.
3.5 Later Epidemic Stages and Effective Reproduction Ratios
Strategic decisions regarding containment of the COVID-19 epidemic, in the UK and
other countries, have depended on trends in new infections and deaths, but also on the
effective reproduction rate. Thus in the UK the choice on whether or not to relax the
initial COVID lockdown restructions was based on five criteria, with two being numeric:
first, "a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates", and second that the "rate of
infection is decreasing to manageable levels", meaning that the effective reproduction
ratio is demonstrably below 1. The reproduction rate may also become especially
relevant at later epidemic stages (post-lockdown), after a downturn from the initial peak
and after lockdown measures have been relaxed. Here the concern is to prevent a
resurgence of infection, indicated by an upturn in R t .
In the case of a protracted downturn, with new cases remaining non-neglible, the
concern is especially that there may be a resurgence in cases, and possibly also
deaths, at some point. This is colloquially known as a "second wave", and in some
European countries (e.g. France, Spain) there have been pronounced second waves in
the COVID-19 epidemic. Such a resurgence indicates use of a multiphase model [39],
with a second phenomenological model applied to data after a switch-point between
epidemic regimes.
Consider a model for new cases only. The two phenomenological models (before and
after the switch-point) have distinct parameters. The switch-point is taken as a latent
parameter, , such that for a two-phase Richards model
ct  Poisson t 

 t  It  r 1 C t−1 1 − C t−1 /K 1  a 1 



It ≥ r 2 C t−1 1 − C t−1 /K 2  a 2 

where IA  1 when condition A is true, and 0 otherwise. The parameter 
can be assigned a uniform prior (on a positive interval) or a positive valued prior, such
as an exponential density. If there is a second wave upturn in deaths also, then a
bivariate model can be used, with switch points later for deaths than cases, due to
delays in mortality upturns following incidence upturns. A three phase model would
have two switch-points, with mean
 t  It  1 r1 C t−1 1 − C t−1 /K 1  a 1  
I2  t ≥ 1 r 2 C t−1 1 − C t−1 /K 2  a 2  
It ≥ 2 r 3 C t−1 1 − C t−1 /K 3  a 3 .

An estimator of the effective reproduction rate R t at time t is based on predictions
from the phenomenological model, possibly multiphase, and from an estimate of the
serial interval density. The serial interval is the time between symptom onset in an
infected subject and symptom onset in the infectee. The serial interval density can
discretized in the form of weights  j , applied to serial interval lengths (in days) up to a
maximum J . These can be used to estimate effective reproduction ratios R t within
a phenomenological model to analyse new cases; see the papers [25], [40] and [41].
Thus R t can be estimated as
J

R t  cnew,t /

∑  jcnew,t−j,
j0

where c new,t

are predicted new case data from the phenomenological model.

4. Model Application
We consider the application of the above methods to UK data on new cases and deaths
from 1st February 2020 (when the first two cases of COVID-19 in the UK were reported
according to ECDC). Observations are assigned dates as in the ECDC data. Figures 1a
and 1b show daily trends in these outcomes up to 8th August 2020, with erratic
fluctuations apparent in both outcomes. However, there is a broad downward trend in
both outcomes from days 70 to 80, though with a more protracted decline as opposed to
the initial upturn. Figures 2a and 2b show the relatively smooth evolution of cumulative
cases and deaths.
4.1 Medium Term Forecasts
For medium term forecasts, we focus on the Richards bivariate model (section 3.3) and
compare three alternative error assumptions as discussed in section 3.2:
Poisson-Gamma (PG), Poisson-lognormal (PLN) and Poisson-log-Student (PLS). The
Student density is represented by a scale mixture of normals [42]. Cross-validation
estimations are made at three points M  T . Thus we consider twenty day ahead
forecasts at three different stages of the UK COVID-19 epidemic. For the first cross
validation, estimations are based on training data up to day M  80 with F  20
(i.e. the cross validation period consists of days 81 to 100 ). Cross validation
estimations with F  20 are also made for M  100 and for M  120 , with
forecast accuracy based on comparing forecasts with hold out data for days
M  1, . . . , M  F .
4.2 Model Assumptions
For prior densities on the unknowns in the medium term forecasts, exponential priors
with mean 1 are assumed on rc , rd , a c and a d . For the precision 1/ 2 in
the PLN and PLS options, and for the parameter  in the Poisson-gamma model, a
gamma prior Gamma1, 0. 001 is assumed. For the PLS option, we take   4 as a

preset option. The degrees of freedom can be difficult to estimate for relatively small
datasets, and the option of the preset value   4 is a robust option [43, 44]. For the
maximum cases (epidemic size) parameter K c we assume as lognormal prior,
e
centred at logK c , as discussed in section 3.2.
For the maximum deaths parameter K d , we assume K d  K c where the prior for
 is a beta with mean defined by the EU-wide case fatality  EU with total prior
count C set at 5, C  5 . Thus the prior on  is BetaC EU , C1 −  EU . For
example, on 20-04-2020 (at day t=80), the EU wide case fatality rate was 0.101, and the
prior is set at   Beta0. 505, 4. 495.
4.3 Model Fit and Estimation
Fit to the observed training data is assessed using the Watanabe--Akaike information
criterion (WAIC) [45]. Cross-validation fit is assessed by the probabilities of
overprediction  c and  d , and by predictive coverage: whether the credible
intervals for predicted cases and deaths (averages over each validation period) include
the actual averages. Estimation uses the BUGS program [46], with posterior estimates
based on the second halves of two chain runs of 100,000 iterations, and convergence
assessed using Brooks-Gelman-Rubin criteria [47].
4.2 Modelling Later Epidemic Stages
To provide a longer term perspective on epidemic containment, we apply the best
performing model to the full set of observations as at 8th August 2020 (T=190) when the
first epidemic peak had passed. At this point there were 309 thousand cumulative cases
and 46500 cumulative deaths. New cases and deaths (as 7 day moving averages) had
reached maxima of 4850 and 950 respectively when the UK epidemic peaked in April.
As a result of lockdown measures imposed in late March, by July daily new cases
averaged just over 500 daily. However, lockdown relaxations from July were
accompanied by the risk of resurgence. In that regard, an upturn was apparent with new
cases in late July and early August averaging over 800 daily (see Figure 3), though
deaths continued to fall, averaging around 50 per day in early August.
To model the full time series, and since there is no upturn in deaths, we focus on new
cases only. A two phase model is applied with shift parameter  assigned an
exponential density with mean 150. Priors on the parameters of the second phase
Richards model are as before for the exponential ascent and logistic modifier
parameters. For K 2 we assume K 2  K 1 with  assigned an exponential prior
with mean 1. Of policy interest here is epidemic containment, as summarised by the
effective reproduction ratio: specifically is this ratio consistently below 1, and its 95%
credible interval also entirely below 1.
To provide estimates of the effective reproduction ratio, we use accumulated evidence
on COVID serial intervals from five studies [48,49,50,51,52]. A gamma density on the

serial interval (SI) is assumed, and information on mean and standard deviation of the
SI, or on quantiles of SI, is converted to gamma density parameters; for use of SI
quantiles in this regard, see [53]. Large samples (of a million) from each the five
densities are taken, and parameters of the pooled gamma density are estimated from
the pooled sample of five million; the pooled density has shape 1.38 and rate 0.36. This
density is then converted to a discretized form (with 16 bins) to provide an informative
prior on the SI to the model of White and Pagano [54], which updates the prior serial
interval density using new case data for the UK. The paper [55] recommends that the
initial, approximately exponential, epidemic phase be used in estimation, and we use
UK new case data up to time 24-04-2020, when UK new cases peaked [see 55, page
3]. The updated mean serial interval is estimated as 3.5 days with standard deviation
3.1. The discretized serial interval is estimated as in [54], with J  16 .
5. Results and Discussion
5.1 Table 1 compares parameter estimates from the observed (training) data under the
three error assumptions for the three cross-validation analyses at M=80, M=100 and
M=120. It should be noted that predictions of cases and deaths should be based not on
the posterior mean or median parameter values in Table 1, but on sampled replicate
data at each iteration. These are based on sampling new data from the Poisson means
(4) and (5), and from the Richards model parameter profile at each particular iteration.
The predicted values of cases and deaths are very close to actual values: for example,
for the PLS model at M=120, the average absolute deviation (over t  2, . . , 120 )
between actual new cases and predicted new cases is under 1. Table 2 compares the
WAIC fits to the observed data under the nine options, while criteria regarding 20 day
ahead forecasts are shown in Table 3.
5.2 Mid Term Forecasts.
Table 1 shows broad consistency between the three distributional options in terms of
estimated final epidemic size K c and eventual death total K d . The posterior
density of these parameters may be skewed, with posterior mean exceeding median.
For the PLN and PLS options the estimate of K c increases as M does. This
reflects the protracted nature of the UK downturn in cases. Posterior mean estimates of
the turning points  c and  d vary slightly and tend to be higher for M  100 and
M  120 , but for both outcomes and all M values are between 72 and 86. Turning
point estimates for new cases  c are also mostly higher under the PLS option.

Table 2 shows that the PLS option has better fit, with lower WAIC values. Hence its
estimates of epidemic size and turning points are preferred, and provide a better
description of the slow decline in cases from their peak. Table 3 shows generally better
cross-validation performance for the PLS option. As discussed above, satisfactory
prediction would have 0. 05   c  0. 95, and 0. 05   d  0. 95, with  c or  d
over 0.95 indicating overprediction, and with  c or  d under 0.05 indicating
underprediction. Both PG and PLN options show underprediction for higher values of

M , and in policy terms, may be misleading in suggesting a faster decline in cases and
deaths than actually occurred. By contrast for M  100 and M  120 , the 95%
interval for predicted average cases under the PLS model comfortably includes the
actual average new cases.

5.3 Longer Term Scenario
Estimates of policy relevant parameters also come from the longer term scenario when
the log-Student Richards model is applied to UK COVID new case data up to day T=190
(8th August, 2020). The shift point in the two phase model is estimated as 179.1 with
95% interval from 179.0 to 179.3.
Figure 4 plots out the posterior mean estimated effective reproductive ratios (5 day
moving averages), distinguishing those estimates significantly above 1. The estimates
hover around 1 throughout June and the first half of July, but in late July/early August
tend to exceed 1. The impression from this is that success in fully effective containment
is in doubt. The estimates of the reproduction ratio, and their path through June and
July, are similar to those for the UK available at
https://epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/united-kingdom/#national-summary and
based on the methods in [56].
6. Conclusion
Many applications of phenomenological models have been to complete epidemics.
However, evaluation of such models based simply on their fit to observed data may give
only a partial picture. Also relevant to epidemic model assessment, particularly for policy
application, is the accuracy of medium term forecasts for incomplete epidemics.
Arguably, evaluation in this case is better done using a cross-validation approach,
where only some of the observed data are used to estimate parameters and a hold out
sample can assess the accuracy of forecasts. The analysis here has shown that fit to
training data and the cross validation fit are consistent in their choice of preferred model
option.
Many applications of phenomenological models have also been to cumulative cases
data. However, to quote [57] on cholera epidemics, "The [incidence] data from
Zimbabwe show multiple peaks and other features characteristic of heterogeneously
mixed populations [...]. The practice of fitting epidemic models to cumulative incidence
curves rather than incidence curves can obscure these features while also violating
statistical assumptions of independence between fitted data points". A focus on
incidence rather than cumulative incidence does therefore bring into sharper focus the
question of adequately representing often erratic fluctuations in the observed series,
apparent in UK COVID data on new cases and deaths.
For larger counts, and overdispersed count data, the literature has mainly focussed on
the negative binomial as the solution to such variability. So far as the authors are aware,
the literature does not contain any assessment of alternative distributional choices to
the Poisson-gamma mixture (negative binomial). Hence the contribution of this paper

rests on a comparison of the negative binomial against alternative Poisson mixture
models [30]. The analysis suggests these may usefully be considered as alternatives to
the negative binomial, and may both improve fit to actual observations and provide
more accurate forecast performance.
There is also value in applying phenomenological models to later stages of incomplete
epidemics, especially (in the case of COVID-19) after lockdown relaxation where there
may be second waves of infection. The above analysis has therefore applied the
Poisson-log Student to late epidemic data for the UK,with a focus on the effective
reproduction rate or effective reproduction ratio. As mentioned in [58], "the COVID-19
pandemic has shown that the effective reproduction rate of the virus R t is a crucial
determinant not only of public health, but also of public policy". There are a number of
ways of estimating this quantity, including novel approaches such as using Google
mobility data [59]. Here an analysis using estimates of R t based on a two-phase
Richards model suggest a upturn in transmission in the UK.
