Abstract
Background:
COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that began to rapidly spread in the US with the first case
detected on January 19, 2020, in Washington State. March 9, 2020, and then increased rapidly
with total cases of 25,739 as of April 20, 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic is so unnerving that it
is difficult to understand how any person is affected by the virus. Although most people with
coronavirus 81%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
will have little to mild symptoms, others may rely on a ventilator to breathe or not at all. SEIR
models have broad applicability in predicting the outcome of the population with a variety of
diseases. However, many researchers use these models without validating the necessary
hypotheses. Far too many researchers often "overfit" the data by using too many predictor
variables and small sample sizes to create models. Models thus developed are unlikely to stand
validity check on a separate group of population and regions. The researcher remains unaware
that overfitting has occurred, without attempting such validation. In the paper, we present a
combination algorithm that combines similar days features selection based on the region using
Xgboost, K-Means, and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to construct a
prediction model (i.e., K-Means-LSTM) for short-term COVID-19 cases forecasting in
Louisana state USA. The weighted k-means algorithm based on extreme gradient boosting is
used to evaluate the similarity between the forecasts and past days. The results show that the
method with K-Means-LSTM has a higher accuracy with an RMSE of 601.20 where as the
SEIR model with an RMSE of 3615.83.

Introduction
In December 2019, unknown viral pneumonia was identified in the City of Wuhan, China [1].
In February 2020, the WHO identified it as a coronavirus – and named it COVID-19 which
presents as an acute respiratory syndrome and a highly communicable disease that is extremely
efficient at the person to person transmission. According to guidance for diagnosis and
treatments for COVID-19 issued by the World Health Organization, COVID-19 was
transmitted through respiratory aspirates, droplets, contacts, and feces, and aerosols
transmission is highly possible[2]. Since its initial detection, the COVID-19 has spread rapidly;
it has been declared as a pandemic and has infected over 5.2 million people in more than 210
countries [3-4]. Despite measures implemented in China during the initial phase of spread,

multiple epicenters have emerged across the world especially in certain European countries
and in the United States of America (USA). The USA has 1.6 million confirmed cases and
96,662 deaths, the most of any country in the world, as of the date _according to the World
coronavirus update [4]. In the USA, the State of Louisiana has 25,739 confirmed cases (9th
highest state) and 1,540 deaths (8th highest state) as of the date [5]. The mean age of these who
died in Louisiana was 70 years, and lots of patients had diabetes 36.65% and cardiovascular
diseases 20.92% [6]. On March 23, 2020, the Governor of Louisiana implemented
extraordinary measures to limit the transmission by implementing the Stay at Home order that
intended to scale back the people are available in contact with those that are infected. This
decision was made in light of a daily rate of infection consistently between 1.5% and 3.5%
with an overall average of 2.6% from March 9th until May 13, 2020, and the proportion of
patients admitted to intensive care units consistently between 14 to 16% who were actively
infected [7].
The rapid spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the need to understand how population
dynamics interact with pandemics [8]. For example, the effects of the virus are more severe in
the elderly and population aging is currently more pronounced in wealthier countries which
potentially may lessen the impact of this pandemic in lower-income countries with weaker
health systems, but younger age structures. Climate variables can also be a direct cause of
biological interactions between COVID-19 and humans. Optimal temperature, humidity, and
wind speed are variables that can determine the survival and transmission of the SARS virus
[9-11]. Changes in weather are very significantly correlated with changes in mortality rates due
to pneumonia [12]. The extreme weather conditions that accompany long-term climate change
may also contribute to the spread of the West Nile virus in the United States and Europe[13].
Certain climatic conditions can be considered as the top predictors of respiratory diseases such
as SARS.
Several statistical and mathematical models, such as the SEIR [14] (susceptible, exposed, infected, and
resistant) model, have been designed to simulate the effect of disease on many levels. In the SEIR
model, the transmission of disease or the incubation period is incorporated. The SEIR model is useful
for estimating the dynamics of transmission but the model rests on simplifications. These models are
usually written as ordinary differential equations (ODE) as opposed to more comprehensive models of
the nonlinear dynamics comprehensively that include the time-variant and probabilistic variables into
the models. It is necessary to define all the parameters for estimation like rate of transmission of disease.
The data scarcity renders at an early stage models that are unfeasible to predict the trend disseminate.
The accuracy of forecasting the future cases of COVID-19 can be improved relative to the SEIR model
can be improved by including these features in a model.

To overcome limitations of the SEIR model approach, and assist public health planning and
policymaking, we are using on deep learning models for real-time forecasting of the new and
cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in total across Louisiana state. Viruses can be
transmitted by being influenced by several factors, including climatic conditions (such as
temperature and humidity), and population density, race but few models include the effects of
climate, population density on COVID-19. In this study, we compare the performance of KMeans-LSTM models to more traditional compartmental models (SEIR) for estimating the
spread of an infectious disease outbreak. The deep learning model is equipped with individual
parish, demographics, population density, age, temperature, humidity, average household
income per year, and risk of COVID-19 for the parish to understand these effects on COVID19 transmission and to produce more accurate predictions.

The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the data source. Section 3 gives
a brief description of the epidemiologic transmission model used for forecasting. Section 4
introduces the proposed method—section 5 comparative analysis of different experimental
results. Section 6 is the Discussion and conclusion.
Methods
Datasources
Data on the COVID-19 pandemic is available from the GitHub repository managed by the John
Hopkins University was collected for the modeling. This is a collection of publicly available
data from multiple sources, which are processed and delivered by the Johns Hopkins University
Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The COVID-19 Data (by John
Hopkins University) contains the daily number of confirmed deaths, and recovered people. The
Basic information contains information about the date, country (Reconfirm: country or county),
and state of the cases. Notice that the data are provided to the public strictly for educational
and academic research purposes. In this study, we are focus on the state of Louisiana State
daily figures and the three variables of deaths, confirmed cases, and recoveries. The data refer
to daily cumulative cases and cover the period from January 22, 2020, until April 19, 2020.
The data are updated daily, and the files used in this paper have been downloaded from [15]
Demographic data for the state of Louisiana was downloaded [16]. The following variables
were collected: parish name, parish population, parish population density, race (white, African
American, Asian, other, or unknown), ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic), age by categories,
average daily temperature, average daily humidity, and the median age in the parish. In the
analysis, we included only parish demographics data, which were reported with COVID-19
cases repository managed by John Hopkins University.
The weather data is included in this research for the period of research were obtained from the
[17]The data consist of temperature minimum (°F), temperature maximum (°F), temperature
average (°F), and humidity (%).
Data Preparation.
Our analysis is based on the following information:
•
•
•
•

The daily reported the number of confirmed cases from 3rd March 2020 to 26th May
2020 in Louisiana state parishes.
Demographic information of these Louisiana state parishes.
Temperature and humidity during our study period at these Louisiana state parishes.
Combined all three data into one final dataset.

Data Analysis
Pearson correlation test was used to examine the relationship between weather and daily
COVID-19. Table 1 shows that, among four weather variables, only temperature average (°F)
significantly correlated with COVID-19 (r = 0.439; p < .001), with a medium level.
Temperature minimum, temperature maximum, and humidity were not significantly correlated

with COVID-19. So we used only Temperature avg °F from an all-weather variable for further
analysis.

SEIR Model
Kermack and McKendrick (1927) first proposed the SEIR type epidemiological
models for the modeling of infectious disease studies. SEIR models people are divided
into population four states: susceptible (S), exposed/latent (E), infectious (I), and
recovered/removed (R) individuals and models are applied to based on the
classification of the contamination of individuals involved.
The population size is N where N = S + E + I + R. Here we normalize to one, so all
results should be interpreted infractions of the relevant state S = S/N, I = I/N, E=E/N,
and R = R/N. The dynamics between the four states are described by differential
equations (4) – (6), and the transfer rates between these four states decide how an
epidemic plays out over time.Where σ is the incubation rate (the latent rate at which a person
becomes infectious); γ is the recovery rate (determined by 1/D where D is the duration of
infection); ξ the rate at which recovered people become susceptible (due to low immunity or
other health-related issues), and β is the infectious rate (the probability of disease-transmitting
to susceptible persons from an infectious person).

In this model, the 𝑅0 value is important. It tells about the contagiousness of the disease.
𝑅0 determines an average of what number of people can be affected by a single infected person
over time. 𝑅 0 It depends on the exponential rate of growth of the COVID−19 outbreak, as well
as additional variables such as the latent duration (time from infection) and infectious duration,
all of which can not be determined directly from the results. 𝑅0 can be calculated using the
ratio of the transmission rate to the recovery rate shown in equation (5).

The proposed framework
In this section, we first present the overview of our proposed deep learning architecture and
then discuss each component of the forecasting framework process is shown in Figure. 1.

The Overall Procedure
First, we estimate the probability of COVID-19 from age and race for each parish in Louisiana
mentioned below. Then, a clustering algorithm is applied to the features to find the optimal
grouping of time series data of COVID-19 confirmed cases and parishes. After clustering, each
cluster of time series data of COVID-19 confirmed cases and parishes would go through a

series of preprocessing steps like normalization, as shown in equation (6) to generate input data
for the LSTM model. In the following sections, we explain a brief introduction to the LSTM
model and time series clustering using K-means algorithm.

Estimating the Probability of COVID-19 from age and race
COVID-19 case rates are available either by age or by race, but not for each and race mix. We
model the model rate with a logistic to obtain these estimates between age brackets(e.g., 1020, 20-30,… etc.) and race (white, African American, Asian, other, or unknown), ethnicity
(Hispanic or non-Hispanic). This model gives the probability of risk of COVID-19 𝑃𝑐 (𝐴𝑎𝑣𝑔 ,𝑅𝑘 )
for each parish as shown in equation (7).
𝑃𝑐 (𝐴𝑎𝑣𝑔 ,𝑅𝑘 )= 𝜎(𝛿𝑎𝑔𝑒 (𝑎𝑖 ) + 𝛿𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒 [𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒 𝜖 𝑟𝑖 ])

(7)

Current data sources say that probabilities 𝑃𝑐 (𝐴𝑎𝑣𝑔 ) and 𝑃𝑐 (𝑅𝑘 ) are independent [20].To
assume a mutual distribution, we assume a linear (logistic) relationship between age group,
different races: Where Where 𝛿𝑎𝑔𝑒 (𝑎𝑖 ) has a value for each age group and 𝛿𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒 are scalars.
The marginal distributions 𝑃𝑐 (𝐴𝑎𝑣𝑔 )and 𝑃𝑐 (𝑅𝑘 )are reported by Louisiana Facility [21]. We
assume that these distributions are the same in COVID-19 patients as in the general population.
[21]

Feature Selection:
To improve learning performance and quality extraction features, data must be preprocessed
and more features displayed to promote model learning. Feature extraction is used to compress
large data sets utilizing dimensionality reduction procedure in time series data mining. Using
feature extraction, computational efficiency can be increased and the use of more sophisticated
algorithms is possible. Most methods of extraction of the features are standardized in nature;
the features extracted are typically based on application. Therefore, one set of features that
work well on one application may not be relevant to another application. The identification
feature involves the application of Datamining techniques like clustering algorithms to derive
usage patterns from the data. Extracting the simplified characteristics of data from time series
will offer a more significant reduction in dimensionality (Features) compared to other
approaches.
This section presents an alternative to conventional feature selection by calculating the weights
of the feature using the Xgboost algorithm and combining the weighted feature using the
clustering of the k-means algorithm. Three ensemble implementations in common packages
such as XGBoost [22], scikitlearn [23], and the python package [24] enable a user to use
clustering and XGBoost to compute a measure of feature importance.

Feature-Weight Learning Algorithm: Extreme Gradient Boosting
Xgboost [25] is an improved decision-making algorithm based on the gradient boosting tree
and can create boosted trees efficiently and run in parallel.The core of the algorithm is to
optimize the value of the objective function. Unlike the use of the feature, vectors to calculate
the similarity between the forecasting and history days, gradient boosting constructs the
boosted trees to intelligently obtain the feature scores, thereby indicating the importance of
each feature to the training model.
The value of a feature depends on how the predictive output changes dramatically when repla
cing such a feature with random noise. With the COVID-19 instances, we take multiple
features as input for the Xgboost algorithm to measure the functional significance. In the
Xgboost algorithm's training course, we can obtain how each feature contributes to the
prediction results. COVID-19 cases are sensitive to Risk of COVID-19 of the parish for
COVID-19 case forecasting(shown in Figure 2). The essential values of all features that will
be used as a priori knowledge of the subsequent clustering algorithm are now extracted from
them.

Figure 2. XGBoost feature importance.

K-means:
Clustering are the most useful tools for data mining, compression, probability density
estimation, and many other essential tasks. There are many clustering algorithms like K-means,
PAM, DBSCAN, many more. K-means algorithm is the most used clustering method. J.
Macqueen originally proposed the K-Means algorithm in 1967 [26].
The steps of using clustering for feature selection are presented as follows.

The next center 𝑢𝑗 is selected, where 𝑢𝑗 Is the most distant point from the cluster centers
previously identified { 𝑢0 , 𝑢1 , 𝑢2 , , , , , 𝑢𝑡−1 }. Steps 2 and 3 will be repeated until the
centers K are identified.
The weights of the features are calculated by using the algorithm Xgboost. After that,
the weights are attributed to each feature, thereby providing them with different levels
of importance. Let 𝑤𝑝 be the weight is associated with the feature p. The norm is
presented as follows.

a. That data point is allocated to the closest cluster.
b. Updating the clusters is achieved by recalculating the centroid cluster. The
algorithm executes (a) and (b) repeatedly until convergence is attained.

Our proposed method Xgboost-k-means can more easily combine features into one cluster than
the simple algorithm k-means does. The features may then be the input data for subsequent
loading to forecast the number of cumulative COVID cases. For forecasting the number of
confirmed, features were extracted from raw data, as mentioned in the data source. We
extracted 12 features from the data. Deaths, confirmed cases, recovered. Parish name, the
population of the parish, population density of the parish, race (aggregated into white, African

American, Asian, other, and unknown), ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic) and median age.
Temperature average (°F).
LSTM Model:
The LSTM is an improvement on RNN [27], it contains a processor that determines whether
the information is useful or not, in which the working part is named as a cell. There are three
doors in a cell: the input layer door, the forget-gate, and the output layer door. Input layer door
and forget-gate both work on the state of cells. However, the role of the input gate is to
selectively record new information into the cell state, while forget-gate is aimed at selectively
forgetting information about cell states. The output layer gate acts on the hidden layer to output
information. The structural model is shown in Figure. 3. In this study, the aim was to estimate
the number of positive COVID-19 cases through time; as this is a well-suited task for the LSTM
model, we used this model in our study.

The decoder generates an output sequence 𝑦 ^ = {𝑦|𝑀|,

} that is the forecast of
the COVID-19 cases for the next n+1 day. All the separate LSTM for each parish forecasts are
added to get total number of COVID-19 cases.
Parameter Setting and Training
Each city in Louisiana was trained using its case data. Because of the relatively small dataset,
we developed a more straightforward network structure to prevent overfitting. The model was
optimized using Adam optimizer and ran for 500 iterations. Although during optimization, the
network was validated by predicting active cases, the same network was used to predict death,
recovery, and the current number of cases. The COVID-19 cases from March 9, 2020, until
May 19, 2020, were used for tests, and rest were used for training. Standard backpropagation
is used to train the network using Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD), a gradient-based
technique. We used the Keras [28] library with the TensorFlow backen [29] to train the
proposed models.

Confirmed Cases: First COVID-19 case was reported in Louisiana on March 9th, 2020.
Reports the growth rate of cases on that specific date shown in Figure 5. There are several dates
with outlier growth rates due to testing rollouts. Louisiana is leading in the per capita test score,
relative to the rest of th United States. 75,000 individuals have been studied in a population of
nearly 4.7 million people. . Every day, Louisiana received around 5,600 new tests, with 6.8
percent of those showing positive results. A total of 306 new cases reported by the State per
day. [31]

Discussion
It takes effective strategies to prevent and control the epidemic spread. Estimating the
epidemiological pattern of outbreak prevalence is critical for the allocation of medical services,

for controlling manufacturing activities, and even for the country's national economic growth.
Thus, it is essential to create a reliable and suitable forecasting model that can help governments
as a reference to decide on emergency macroeconomic strategies and medical resource
allocation. SEIR model is one of the most commonly used epidemiological models.
Although SEIR-based models were widely used to model the COVID-19 outbreak, they do
contain some degree of uncertainty. As an alternative to the SEIR model, this research proposed
a deep learning model (K-Means-LSTM) as a new trend in advancing outbreak modeling. The
K-Means-LSTM strategy does not predict the infection's pandemic and spread. Instead, it
predicts the infected cases time series. The K-Means-LSTM is used for this analysis to forecast
the COVID-19 outbreak for Lousiana. This study suggests K-Means-LSTM as a useful tool for
modeling the outbreak based on the results reported here and given the complex nature of the
COVID-19 outbreak and its parish-to-parish behavioral variation. Training data is used to train
the algorithm and ascertain the best set of parameters to be used in K-Means-LSTM. K-MeansLSTM has three main advantages. First, the model learns not only from the historical COVID19 data but also from COVID-19 's applied demographic data, weather and risk for each parish.
The model's second advantage is its capacity to be applied at different scales. It can currently
forecast the spread in a parish and state. Lastly, the model can forecast short and long-term
forecasts that could be a reliable decision-making tool.
Limitation
In comparison, we note that the width of prediction intervals made by K-Means-LSTM
decreases on average as more data is used for predictions. It can partially be attributed to the
larger number of cases and the longer initial forecast time seen in many parishes. K-MeansLSTM outperforms the commonly used SEIR, but more features and input data are needed to
estimate the trends. Although we have promising results for data from Louisiana, these new
approaches need to be further assessed on other datasets. However, the findings presented are
encouraging and will inspire the group to adopt these new tools quickly.
Conclusion
Accurate COVID-19 case forecasting is a significant problem for public health authorities to
efficiently and timely coordinate patient care and other services required to solve the epidemic.
In this research, we propose a K-Means-LSTM neural network to tackle the issue of variance
and precision in predicting the number of reported cases in the traditional SEIR model. The
findings of the study will help policy and healthcare efficiently prepare and provide services to
handle the situation in these states over the next few days and weeks, including nurses, beds,
and intensive care facilities. The data should be updated in real-time for more precise
comparison and future perspectives.
