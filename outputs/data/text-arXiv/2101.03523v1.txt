Abstract

Global lockdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to changes in the
anthropogenic activities resulting in perceivable air quality improvements. Although several recent
studies have analyzed these changes over different regions of the globe, these analyses have
been constrained due to the usage of station based data which is mostly limited upto the
metropolitan cities. Also the quantifiable changes have been reported only for the developed and
developing regions leaving the poor economies (e.g. Africa) due to the shortage of in-situ data.
Using a comprehensive set of high spatiotemporal resolution satellites and merged products of
air pollutants, we analyze the air quality across the globe and quantify the improvement resulting
from the suppressed anthropogenic activity during the lockdowns. In particular, we focus on
megacities, capitals and cities with high standards of living to make the quantitative assessment.
Our results offer valuable insights into the spatial distribution of changes in the air pollutants due
to COVID-19 enforced lockdowns. Statistically significant reductions are observed over
megacities with mean reduction by 19.74%, 7.38% and 49.9% in nitrogen dioxide (NO2), aerosol
optical depth (AOD) and PM2.5 concentrations. Google Earth Engine empowered cloud computing
based remote sensing is used and the results provide a testbed for climate sensitivity experiments
and validation of chemistry-climate models. Additionally, Google Earth Engine based apps have
been developed to visualize the changes in a real-time fashion.

Introduction

The impedance caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to worldwide disruptions in day-today human activities across the globe. As per the World Health Organization (WHO) Weekly
Epidemiological Update issued on 15th December 2020, more than 70 million were infected
alongside death numbers exceeding 1.6 million worldwide. The characteristics of the virus
included rapid spread from human-to-human making its infections difficult to contain. There has
been an evidence of virus spreading through the air, after the WHO declared it a pandemic on
30th January 2020 (Zander et al, 2020). Almost every country was affected with frequent cases of
infected but asymptomatic individual. Those potential virus carriers made its transmission hard to
track. In that scenario and unavailability of any vaccine hitherto, most of the countries declared
lockdowns to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus. This led to a halt in the anthropogenic
activities in urban and industrialized areas across the world.
Estimates from the United Nations show that 55% of the world’s population lives in urban
areas as of 2018, and by 2050 close to 68% would be living in urban areas (The Department of
Economic and Social Affairs, 2019). By 2018, there are 33 megacities in the world with population
more than 10 million, hosting ~12.5% of the world’s total urban population. Due to the high
population density, understanding the environmental impacts of megacities are of utmost concern
for policy makers to ensure public health and safety. Emissions from the industries, automobiles,
construction processes, and other anthropogenic activities have led to high levels of air pollution
over megacities (Butler et al., 2008; Gurjar et al., 2008; Molina et al., 2012; Baklanov et al., 2016;
Marlier et al., 2016), making them hotspot for various greenhouse gases, ozone precursors and
aerosols observed well upto the tropopause layers (Brunamonti et al., 2018; Hanumanthu et al.,
2020). Various studies have reported increased mortality rates around the world’s megacities
caused by the air pollution. Cohen et al. (2017) reported that exposure to PM2.5 and tropospheric
ozone (O3) caused ~4·2 and ~0.25 million deaths worldwide respectively in 2015. Gaseous
3

pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) are also
responsible for human health hazards (WHO, 2013; US Environmental Protection Agency, 2015).
The primary sources of nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere are fossil fuel and biomass burning
and various microbiological reactions in wildfires, lightning and soils. In addition to the
anthropogenic sources, natural emissions such as that from the volcanic eruptions are also
harmful to the environment in the short term and also modulating the global hydroclimate (Singh
et al. 2020).
Nitric oxide (NO) rapidly oxidizes to NO2 in the air and plays crucial role in the formation
of photochemical smog, affects air quality and climate. The dominant impact of NOx (NO+NO 2)
emissions on the climate is through the formation of O3, the third largest single contributor to
positive radiative forcing. Emissions of NOx generate indirect negative radiative forcing by
shortening the atmospheric lifetime of CH4. NOx dominantly controls the O3 budget through
photochemistry. It is well documented that high amounts of NOx emitted from the industries,
thermal power plants and automobiles leads to surface ozone production (Lelieveld et al., 2000)
and leads to the exceedances of the standard limit of the urban ozone concentration (Frost et al.,
2006). Tropospheric NO and O3 are potential greenhouse gases and influence the lifetime of the
other greenhouse gases. Also, the NOx compounds act as precursors for the aerosol nitrate and
influences significantly the abundance of the hydroxyl radical (OH). Furthermore, NO2 also
produces nitric acid (HNO3) which is a major component of acid rain by reacting with hydroxyl
radical (OH). The sources of NOx include both natural and anthropogenic sources. The natural
sources include atmospheric flux exchanges, lighting activity, soil emissions, and forest and
grassland fires while the anthropogenic sources are primarily through emissions from the power
plants, transportation (automobiles, ships and aircrafts), industrial emissions and biomass burning
(Guha et al., 2020). The lifetime of NOx is of the order of minutes to hours, which depends on
various factors such as the season, location, photolysis rate and the concentration of hydroxyl

4

radical (Lamsal et al., 2010). Hence, the short life time and the inhomogeneous source distribution
of NOx clearly lead to the spatiotemporal variations in the NO2 concentration in the troposphere
and it is well proven that tropospheric NO2 observed from the space is dominated by the amount
in the boundary layer (Ghude et al., 2008). Total global NOx emissions have increased from an
estimated pre-industrial value of 12 TgN yr–1 (Holland et al., 1999; Galloway et al., 2004) to
between 42 and 47 TgN yr–1 in 2000 (Solomon et al., 2007). The range of surface NOx emissions
(excluding lightning and aircraft) used in the current generation of global models is 33 - 45 TgN
yr–1 with small ranges for individual sources.
Satellite observations in the past few decades have helped to study long-term spatial and
temporal variation of pollutants around the world. Hilboll et al. (2013) and Georgoulias et al. (2019)
studied the long-term trend of NO2 over the world's megacities using multiple satellite
observations. Long term trends of SO2 have also been studied across the world where the Asian
countries show mostly increasing trends whereas opposite trends have been reported over North
America in the recent decades (Lu et al., 2011, 2013; Kharol et al., 2017; van der A et al., 2017).
Using OMI/MLS satellite observation Cooper et al. (2020) reported 8% relative increase in
tropospheric ozone burden over northern hemisphere (NH) compared to southern hemisphere
(SH) in recent times. The analysis of these satellite datasets and their pre-processing is
cumbersome and error prone due to involved steps. Raw satellite datasets are available in
different formats for different satellites and are mostly available as swath-based products in case
of missions such as MODIS and image blocks in case of Sentinel. The analysis of these datasets
requires them to be mapped to gridded form, necessitating the need of transforming to real
coordinates which is a challenging task. Moreover, different satellites-based instruments require
different corrections and filters to be applied based on data quality over different regions and
instrument-to-instrument differences. The requirement of large disk-space is also a challenge for
many researchers, due to unavailability of high-end computational resources at their end.

5

Cloud computing offers hope in solving these challenges by providing cloud as a service
platform for preprocessing, analyzing and visualizing big data (Gill et al., 2019). Google has
introduced a new cloud-based platform called Google Earth Engine for efficient and fast
processing of large geospatial datasets. It provides a systematic platform to analyze planetaryscale geospatial data to uncover robust computational capacities of Google which can be used
as a source for analyzing problems and proposing solutions for environmental protection, climate
monitoring, water management, food security, disease, disaster, drought and deforestation.
Moreover, this engine is now being utilized to distribute and share results with others, to develop
mobile apps or web based services, interpreting various types of geospatial data, and for
assessing land use change, monitoring climate, malaria risk mapping, flood mapping, urban
mapping, rice paddy mapping, crop yield estimation, global surface water change and global
forest change. For example, an application based on Google Earth Engine is developed to detect
land cover change, which has been implemented successfully in Singapore (Sidhu et al., 2018).
Researchers from Ukraine used Google Earth Engine and created a high resolution crop
classification map for a large spatial region (Shelestov et al., 2017). Further, it has been identified
that machine learning techniques such as random forest and linear regression are working
efficiently for satellite imagery processing and COVID-19 predictions (Tamiminia et al., 2020; Tuli
et al., 2020).
Numerous recent studies have reported improvement in air quality around the world due
to large scale lockdown as a preventive measure to contain COVID-19. Muhammad et al. (2020)
reported such an improvement using satellite data, however only over a short span of time i.e.,
the initial lockdown period. He et al. (2020) studied the short-term impacts of lockdowns across
cities in China by analyzing air quality parameters such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, CO and SO2
using station based data. Their findings showed that large and wealthier cities in China had a
greater reduction in air pollution than otherwise. Huang et al. (2020) showed that impact of

6

COVID-19 forced lockdowns in improving air quality was not always apparent. Shen et al. (2020)
studied the changes in air pollution with respect to meteorology by comparing the 2020 lockdown
period with the 21-year long term means. They noted that large-scale transport of the pollutants
reflected importance of meteorology on air quality at regional scales. Similarly, Chang et al. (2020)
attributed enhanced haze creation during lockdown in China to pollutant pathways. RodríguezUrrego and Rodríguez-Urrego (2020) reported reduction in PM2.5 over 50 most polluted capitals
around the world. They found a 12% reduction in PM2.5 around the world's most polluted capitals
with Bogotá, Colombia showing the highest decrease (57%). Sharma et al. (2020) reported
reduction in air pollution in 22 Indian cities during COVID-19 forced lockdown. Similarly,
improvement in air quality over central China during lockdown was also reported by Xu et al.
(2020). Berman and Ebisu (2020) reported a reduction in NO2 and PM2.5 predominantly over the
urban United States. They compared early and late/no business closure scenarios in different
counties of the country and found clear reductions in the pollutant levels in early closure scenario
over the urban counties. Li et al. (2020) used the WRF-CAMX model to assess lockdown induced
changes in air quality over Yangtze river delta. They found that though the daily PM2.5 reduced
during the lockdown, it was still high and more stringent measures were required for better air
quality. Menut et al. (2020) also employed WRF-CHIMERE modelling system for understanding
the pandemic enforced lockdown changes in air quality over the western Europe during March
2020. Using satellite observations Biswas and Ayantika (2020) reported decrease in NO2,
formaldehyde (HCHO), SO2 and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over India during pre-monsoon
period (March, April and May) compared to past three years due to COVID-19 induced lockdown.
The study reported that mitigation of ozone and large reductions in NO2 were associated with the
muted decrease in particulate matter concentrations. However, our survey finds some limitations
in these studies. Firstly, most of them have used station data to assess the changes in local and
regional air quality which limits the spatial coherence and continuity, particularly the usage of
PM2.5 has been limited in most of the recent studies. Also, there has been an absence of
7

discussions about the AOD, which provides information about the amount of direct sunlight
blocked by various particles/gases when it reaches the surface of Earth. Secondly, the previous
analyses have reported the cases from brief lockdowns during the early phase of pandemic
thereby limiting the robustness of the conclusion. Thirdly, the published results have mostly
discussed the air quality changes in developed and developing city/regions while the relatively
poorer regions (e.g. African continental regions) have mostly been ignored. In addition to these
factors, the existing works are limited by the spread of the observational networks out of the
country capitals or even limited observations in the major cities. For example, the existing station
data network of Central Pollution Control Board which has been used for the past studies over
India, has a good coverage only over the national capital region around Delhi.
Given its global presence, almost every country in the world has used lockdowns as a
preventive measure to contain the further spread of pandemic. As seen in the literature survey,
qualitatively, it has been felt that the lockdowns have improved air quality due to a reduction in
emissions arising out of suppressed anthropogenic activities. Various studies have used station
based datasets to bring out this change whereas others have used satellite datasets to show the
improvements in air quality over a limited period of the lockdown. Moreover, the studies have
been regional in nature and have also not taken into account the high-resolution panoply of
datasets into consideration. Having noted the limitations in the recent studies, the present study
utilizes the Google Earth Engine’s capabilities to quantify the changes in atmospheric pollutants
such as NO2, AOD, O3 and PM2.5 during the COVID forced lockdowns globally. We use multisatellite high resolution datasets spanned over the complete lockdown period until 31 May 2020
to show its environmental affects over 8 major continental parts of the world. Cloud computing
based remote sensing via Google Earth Engine is used and lesser reported regions in other
studies such as Africa have been included and thoroughly explored. Additionally, we also provide

8

Google Earth Engine based apps to visualize the changes in air quality over city-scale spatial
resolutions.

Data and Methodology

The Google Earth Engine, which is the first ever cloud computing based platform enabling
processing, analysis and visualization of satellite and other datasets for the planet Earth, is
extensively used in this study. Google Earth Engine enables the processing, analyzing and
visualization of these large datasets on the cloud. A large number of the datasets being made
available after quality control. Hence, there is no need of performing any major preprocessing or
storage making the analysis a smooth process. This study employs Google Earth Engine
extensively for the analysis and visualization of air quality and other datasets. In this work it has
served as a nodal point for targeted analysis of the quantitative environmental assessment of
COVID-19 enforced lockdowns. The analysis is enabled by direct API calls to the requisite data
and there is no need to download the same. Its use has catapulted the large-data processing
which is otherwise very tedious and error prone task using the traditional approaches. The access
to the platform is provided by an application process and the APIs are available in javascript and
python. In this work, the python API has been used for analysis. All the codes for analysis and
visualization are available at https://github.com/manmeet3591/gee_lockdown.
Satellite data products viz NO2 and tropospheric O3 are used from TROPOspheric
Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI; Veefkind et al., 2012), an instrument onboard Sentinel-5
precursor (Sentinel-5P) satellite. The AOD is obtained from MODIS (Schaaf et al., 2002) and
particulate matter less than 2.5μ (PM2.5) are also based on the data assimilated MODIS product.
The European Space Agency had launched Sentinel-5P on 13 October 2017 as a dedicated
satellite to observe air pollution. The datasets are available in two versions i.e. Offline (OFFL) and
Near Real-Time (NRTI). NRTI products are available earlier than the OFFL products, however

9

OFFL products offer better quality than NRTI and hence are used in this work. The data from
TROPOMI is accessed using Google Earth Engine and is available from July 2018. Tropospheric
ozone concentrations available for the tropical band 20oS-20oN is archived at Google Earth
Engine servers using the raw data and cloud slicing (csa) and convective cloud differential (ccd)
algorithms. AOD data is used from the version 6 of combined MODIS Terra and Aqua product
wherein atmospheric corrected data over land at 1 km horizontal resolution is provided by Google
Earth Engine. PM2.5 is used from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global
Near-Real-Time accessed using Google Earth Engine after 4D-Var data assimilation using
datasets from MODIS. 4D-Var is an advanced analytical method to perform data assimilation.
Data assimilation involves combining short-range prediction with in-situ measurements to provide
the best approximation of Earth system. COVID-19 lockdown start dates are accessed from the
news reports and popular articles. Since lockdowns were still on in countries, the present study
considers the period upto 31 May 2020 (Table 1).
We calculate the percentage change of various air quality parameters, which is the
percentage difference of aggregated means during the two periods. The two periods are defined
as the lockdown period for year 2020 (Y20) and the corresponding epoch in the year 2019 (Y19).
For instance, to calculate the percentage change in NO2 over South Asia, we average the NO2
maps over Y19 and Y20 and then obtain [(Y19 - Y20)/(Y19)]*100 as the percentage change in
NO2 over South Asia in Y19 relative to Y20. We also select 93 urban cities globally by first
selecting the megacities (Mage et al., 1996; Gurjar et al., 2010, 2016; Baklanov et al., 2016;
Cheng et al., 2016; Marlier et al., 2016), followed by European Union capitals and then the cities
with GDP per capita greater than $ 25000. The changes in air quality parameters over these cities
are also performed by the methodology above and averaging over the area of the city. The latitude
longitude information of the cities is obtained from www.latlong.net. We define the extent of the
cities by the area of the cities from these central points (latitude, longitude) which is also taken as

10

the region over which we compute the pollutant concentration variations. It is worthy to note that
for some countries such as Japan and South Korea which did not enforce lockdowns, the analysis
for the cities is not done to bring out the exact impact of lockdowns over the air quality. The
coordinates, population and GDP data of the global megacities along with the start and end of the
lockdown enforcement dates are available on https://rb.gy/t7jzr8. Interactive maps of
meteorological fields such as land surface temperature and surface winds along with four air
pollutants showing the absolute values of COVID19 lockdown period in 2020 and the
corresponding period from 2019 have been prepared as applications of Google Earth Engine.
The links for the same can be found from the section 3.9.

Results and Discussion

In this section we discuss the environmental changes in 8 major regions of the world due to
COVID-19 enforced lockdowns. The subsections describe the changes over Africa, Australia
and New Zealand, East Asia, South Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Southeast
Asia and the global megacities.
3.1

Africa

Surface station-based observations records in various African regions show annual mean NO2
and O3 concentrations to be in the range of 0.9-2.4 ppb and 4.0-14.0 ppb respectively (Adon et
al. 2010). However, during the lockdown period, the level of these pollutants reduced significantly
over the region. The reduction in NO2 concentrations (Fig. 1a) are observed as blobs over urban
areas with more than ~30% decrease over large swathes of South Africa, Botswana, Namibia,
Angola, Tanzania, Kenya and coastal countries of West Africa. Algeria and Niger show a
decrease by ~20% in NO2 concentrations. Over the Arabian Peninsula the decrease is seen only
over urban areas such as Riyadh, Dubai, Muscat, Bahrain, Qatar and Israel. The tropospheric
ozone product is available only from 20oS to 20oN and a 20-30% decrease can be seen over
11

regions surrounding Tanzania, Zambia, Angola, Kenya and Congo (Fig. 1c). The African regions
usually have high AOD values during the local dry seasons (Boiyo et al., 2016) coinciding with
the reduced human activity. This period also overlaps with the lockdown periods (March-May)
used in the study. However, we observe a decrease in the AOD (Fig. 1b) over South Africa,
Botswana and Angola in Southern Africa by ~30-50%, over Nigeria, Ghana Cote d’Ivoire, Sierra
Leone and parts of Niger in Eastern Africa by ~30-50%, over Sudan and Egypt by ~20% and parts
of north Libya by more than 50% relative to the same period (as that of lockdown period in 2020)
in 2019. In the Middle-East, parts of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran show a decrease by ~30%. In
addition, parts of Congo, Tanzania and Kenya also show reduction in AOD when compared with
the month before lockdown. PM2.5 concentrations across African regions have different
characteristics wherein West Africa has higher levels partly arising from dust, while the rest of
Africa has anthropogenic factors dominating the overall concentrations (Heft-Neal et al. 2018).
During the analysis period, reduction in PM2.5 levels can be observed over large parts of Namibia,
western South Africa, the entire Arabian Peninsula and North Africa to negligible amounts during
lockdown (Fig. 1d). A two-thirds decrease can be seen over other parts of Africa. The relative
decrease of ~30% in NO2 over Africa is indeed significant. However, when absolute values are
analyzed, for example using Google Earth Engine apps, we can observe significant changes only
over South Africa and parts of Namibia, Tanzania and Kenya. Over Angola, Namibia and South
Africa decrease in NO2 concentration and in PM2.5 are almost anti-correlated. We observe that
over some regions of Africa, although the change might seem to be large, the base value is not
substantial, which can be clearly understood from the Google Earth Engine apps.
3.2

Australia and New Zealand

The regions in Australia and New Zealand have strong seasonal cycles in the atmospheric
pollutants’ levels. The forest fire/burning lead to enhanced levels apart from the contribution from
human activities (Reisen et al. 2012). The local autumn season coincided with the analysis period
12

wherein NO2 concentration reductions by ~30% can be seen over urban areas such as
Melbourne, Sydney, Auckland, large swathes of New South Wales, Canterbury, Otago and
Southland (Fig. 2a). The region does not show much change in AOD except for areas in Brisbane,
Manawatu-Wanganui and neighborhoods of Perth and Auckland (Fig. 2b). The tropospheric
ozone data is available only for the Northern part of Australia and a reduction by 15-20% can be
seen throughout the region (Fig. 2c). PM2.5 shows large reductions (upto 100% in many regions)
over large parts of Australia and New Zealand. Eastern Australia shows two-third reductions in
PM2.5 concentrations (Fig. 2d). The decrease in NO2 concentration and PM2.5 are almost anticorrelated over Australia and New Zealand.

13

3.3

East Asia

Air pollution has increased over east Asia during the last few decades. The rise has come amidst
the industrial growth leading to higher emissions mostly from the regions in China and Korea (Kim
et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2017). The concentrations of air pollutants have increasing interannual
trend and summer season show increased intra-seasonal variations (Jacob and Winner, 2009).
Here in our study we note that NO2 concentrations show a high reduction of ~50% in the urban
areas of China with the neighborhoods characterizing a reduction of ~33%. South Korea, North
Korea and Japan show ~30-40% decrease in NO2 levels (Fig. 3a). It can be seen that AOD
reduced by ~50% over Shanghai, parts of South Korea, Beijing and regions around Xi'an. The
regions around these centers show ~33% reduction in AOD (Fig. 3b). Tropospheric ozone data
is not available (Fig. 3c) from the satellite over this region so we skip that analysis. PM2.5 shows
a reduction by ~33% over most of the parts of China, North Korea, South Korea and Japan with
more than 50% decrease over Mongolia and the surrounding regions (Fig. 3d). It is to be noted
that the color scale in Figure 3a-d for relative change is from -50% to +50%. Mongolia shows a
significant relative decrease in NO2 which is however not much valuable considering very low
base values, and western China show a significant decrease of PM2.5. Overall, the lockdown
effects in the air pollution are pronounced over east Asia which resulted in improvement of the air
quality.
3.4

South Asia

Similar to the east Asian region, the air pollution in south Asia has also gone up in the last few
decades (Mahajan et al., 2015; Fadnavis et al., 2020 and references therein). The region is
characterized by several developing economies that have paced up the industry thereby
increasing the air pollutants. The region has strong seasonal variability of air pollutants dominated
by the regional meteorological factors (Tiwari et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2017). Particularly the PM2.5

14

concentration minima are noticed in monsoon season which rises during the winter time and is
maintained until pre-monsoon. Surface pollutants over the region are dominated by the changes
over Indian subcontinent. The COVID-19 spread and subsequent lockdowns in 2020 were
imposed during the summer and pre-monsoon months. The changes in NO2 levels show
reductions by more than ~30% seen all over Tier I and II cities in India which are concentrated
over these urban areas (Fig. 4a). The neighboring countries also show similar characteristics with
Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Dhaka seeing around ~30% reductions in NO2 concentrations.
AOD reductions can only be observed over South India, Indo-Gangetic plains, West Bengal and
Myanmar by ~30-40% (Fig. 4b). For the limited region in South India over which Tropospheric
ozone data is available, we do not see any change in the concentrations (Fig. 4c). A remarkable
change is noticed in PM2.5 concentrations where reductions by ~60-70% are noted over large
swathes of South Asia with the reductions nearing complete decimation of the species over
western Rajasthan in India (Fig. 4d).
3.5

Europe

Past studies have shown that the air pollutants have distinct regional variability across Europe. In
general NO2, NOx and PM2.5 concentrations are found to be higher in Southern Europe while
lesser values are found over the regions in Western and Northern Europe (Eeftens et al. 2012).
The region is dominated by the street/urban background concentration ratios for PM2.5 along with
non-tailpipe emissions. Though meteorology plays an important role in the air pollutants variability
over Europe, this region has registered decreasing trends in most of the anthropogenic induced
pollutants due to air pollution controls (Barmpadimos et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2017). With specific
measures to curb the emissions, long term observations show that AOD has decreased over
Europe with largest AOD variations occurring during winter and spring followed by some
reductions in the summer and autumn months (Chiacchio et al. 2011). During the analysis period.
We notice reductions by ~30% in the major cities of Europe such as Lisbon, Madrid, Barcelona,
15

Toulouse, Monaco, Manchester, Birmingham, Istanbul, Moscow, Stockholm, Oslo, Helsinki and
large parts of Germany, regions in and surrounding Paris and London (Fig. 5a). Lowered AOD
values can be seen over cities of western Europe by ~20% and over eastern Europe by 30-50%
(Fig. 5b). The tropospheric ozone data is not available over Europe (Fig. 5c). PM2.5 concentrations
show a reduction by ~33% throughout western Europe except Switzerland and by ~60-70% over
eastern Europe, Sweden, Norway and Finland (Fig. 5d). However, a point to note is the miniscule
absolute reductions and the base values making relative changes over countries such as Norway
insignificant. We also see anomalous improvements in air quality over Switzerland are significant,
however only over major cities such as Zurich, Lucern and Basel. The baseline in other regions,
particularly the mountains is inherently low. However, looking at the absolute values from Google
Earth Engine apps, it seems that the lockdown was highly effective as the NO2 values can be
seen to have dropped down to near zero.
3.6

North America

The region was earlier a major source of emissions, however with strict emission regulations in
the last few decades there has been a marked reduction in rate of increment in air pollutants (NOx,
PM2.5) over the high-income regions of North America (Canada, United States) (Naghavi et al.
2015). Results from past studies show that AOD and PM2.5 agree in terms of interannual variability
and both have decreased with time. Strongest changes have been noted over the eastern part
with moderate changes over the central and western parts (Li et al. 2015). During the analysis
period, we notice further reduction in NO2 concentrations over North America which is visible in
patches hovering over and around the urban areas. The East coast of the United States of
America showed enhanced reductions in NO2 relative to the west coast. Prominent reductions
can be seen over New York, Atlanta, Charlotte, Detroit, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Jose,
Portland, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Mexico City by ~30% (Fig. 6a). Other
regions around these major centres of decreasing NO2 show ~20% decrease in NO2. Similar
16

characteristics can be seen in the change in AOD and PM2.5 concentrations (Fig. 6b,d).
Tropospheric ozone data is absent over North America in our analysis (Fig. 6c). We particularly
note a large increase in NO2 in Western Canada, much more extended than in the highly
populated Eastern side of the US. This is because the figure shows relative change, if however,
we compare the absolute values, it is much less as compared to Eastern US. The state of Alberta
and the city of Edmonton and its surroundings in particular have shown substantial improvements
in air quality even in terms of absolute values.

South America

The region is dominated by the seasonal variability in air pollutant levels where biomass burning
contributes maximum to the NOx variability (Castellanos et al. 2014). Concentrations of PM2.5 and
NOx in the urban parts are mostly influenced by the traffic being the main source (Krecl et al.,
2018). We note reduction in NO2 levels over large swathes of Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru,
Columbia and Venezuela by ~20-30% (Fig. 7a). A 33% decrease in AOD can be observed over
south-eastern Brazil, southern Argentina, Bolivia and Peru with the lowered values reaching 50%
concentrated in and around Sao Paulo (Fig. 7b). We can see 15-20% decrease in tropospheric
ozone concentrations over Brazil and Bolivia (Fig. 7c). Large parts of South America show PM2.5
reductions upto ~60-70% with some regions such as the Roraima in Brazil and Santa Cruz,
Chubut in Argentina showing complete removal of PM2.5 (Fig. 7d). An important point to note is
the improved air quality in South Argentina which is poorly populated but has considerable oil
production. We note as also from (https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latestnews/oil/062620-argentina-extends-tightens-lockdown-puts-fresh-damper-on-oil-demandproduction) that Argentina went into an extended period of lockdown and it also consumes most
of its oil. These might have been the reasons for improved air quality in those regions.

Southeast Asia

This region is also subjected to strong seasonal cycles in air pollutants due to changes in the
atmospheric circulation patterns, however the increasing emissions have a significant contribution
by the biomass burning from Peninsular Southeast Asia (Dong and Fu 2015; Wang et al.,
2017).The finer mode PM2.5 is mostly associated with human activities wherein the AODs peak
during the biomass burning season (Su et al., 2010; Lalitaporn et al., 2013). It can be seen that
during the lockdown period NO2 concentrations reduced by ~30% over Hanoi, Malaysia,
Singapore, Jakarta, Manila and large parts of Indonesia (Fig. 8a). Other regions in southeast Asia
also show a decrease by ~20% of NO2. Hanoi shows the maximum reduction in AOD by ~50%
followed by Singapore (~30-40%) and marginal decrease in other parts of southeast Asia (Fig.
8b). Tropospheric ozone decreased by 20-30% throughout the region (Fig. 8c) and PM2.5
decreased by ~60-70% uniformly over the area (Fig. 8d).

Megacities

More than half of the human population as of 2020 delves in urban areas. Past few decades have
seen exponential growth in the number of these agglomerates and larger urban segments known
as megacities. Megacities have large economies and are also sources of anthropogenic
pollutants. In recent times, the health hazards posed by these pollutants in the megacities have
become evident (Parrish et al., 2009). Urban areas contribute maximum to the rising emissions
throughout the world, with more pronounced effects in the developing countries. With the rise in
population and demands these regions are the hotspots of such air pollutants. In addition to the
regional analysis, we also dig into the lockdown forced changes in the megacities around the
world. We note a significant reduction in the pollutants considered in the study. The results are
present in the supplementary Table 2. We observe a statistically significant fall (Fig. 9) in the NO2,
AOD and PM2.5 concentrations (Table 2) with the reductions amounting to 19.74%, 7.38% and

18

49.9% as the mean with respect to the same period in 2019 as lockdowns in the respective
megacities in 2019. Fig. 9 shows the violin plots of the various species wherein the bubbles
represent the distribution of the global changes. We also note that the pandemic forced lockdown
led to limit the air pollution levels close to or below the targeted levels as prescribed by the WHO
and UNEP led air pollution monitoring network as part of the Global Environment Monitoring
System (Mage et al., 1996). Lima, Port Louis and Mumbai are the top three cities with regards to
reductions in NO2 concentrations ~72%, ~56% and ~50% during 2020 lockdown relative to 2019
whereas Bogota, Guangzhou and Shenzen showed nominally enhanced NO2 concentrations
during lockdown. Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok are the top three cities with regards to
2020 lockdown reductions in O3 concentrations to the tune of 16%, 12% and 10% relative to 2019,
whereas Panama City, Mexico City and Manila show enhanced O3 concentrations relative to
2019. Riyadh, Manama and Abu Dhabi show the largest reductions (75.6%, 73% and 72%
respectively) in PM2.5 concentrations during lockdown whereas Nassau is the only megacity
showing slightly enhanced (~17%) PM2.5 concentrations during lockdown. The megacities
Shenzen, Sao Paulo and Luxembourg show maximum decrease (55%, 48% and 46%
respectively) in AOD whereas Brussels, Panama City and Chongqing show an increase in AOD
during the lockdown relative to 2019.

Conclusions

In this study we have used remote sensing datasets accessed via Google Earth Engine to assess
and quantify the impact of COVID-19 enforced lockdowns on the air pollutants across the world
and over megacities in particular. This work has been possible only because of Google Earth
Engine and also to the open access SENTINEL-5P and MODIS data from the European Space
Agency and NASA. As compared to the air pollutants concentration for the same period in the
previous year, we find significant reductions over all regions in the parameters such as NO2, AOD,
tropospheric ozone and PM2.5. There are however some anomalies or relative variations as well
as significant differences between NO2 and PM2.5 variations that could justify further work to
understand the reasons behind the variations. The satellite data are not available for 2018 and
previous years and hence the comparison has only been done relative to 2019. The main features
of this study are (i) use of complete lockdown period as compared to other works with limited time
duration, (ii) use of multi-pollutants datasets, (iii) use of spatially contiguous satellite datasets
enabling better understanding and (iv) understanding spatial distribution of the changes in air
pollutants due to lockdown. Moreover, this study gives an equal importance to Africa which is less
covered by observational networks and hence the information coming out of the region is limited
(Dinku et al., 2019). The state-of-the-art climate models have large uncertainties in simulating
these air pollutants and COVID-19 has provided a test-bed for their validation. If we look at
Angola, Namibia, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand decrease in NO2 concentration and in
PM2.5 are almost anti-correlated. Since both are only linked to human and particularly traffic
reduction, further research needs to be carried out on this aspect. Moreover, in some areas away
from megacities large variations or anomalous variations may not be significant if absolute values
are low.

This work can serve as a benchmark to assess the climate model simulations

20

understanding the role of lockdown on air quality and hence can also be used to improve the
climate model parameterizations.
