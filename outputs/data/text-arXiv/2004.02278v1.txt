Abstract
The goal of this study is to establish a general framework for predicting the so-called critical
“Turning Period” in an infectious disease epidemic such as the COVID-19 outbreak in China early
this year. This framework enabled a timely prediction of the turning period when applied to
Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic and informed the relevant authority for taking appropriate and
timely actions to control the epidemic. It is expected to provide insightful information on turning
period for the world’s current battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.
The underlying mathematical model in our framework is the individual Susceptible-ExposedInfective-Removed (iSEIR) model, which is a set of differential equations extending the classic
SEIR model. We used the observed daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan from February 6 to 10, 2020
as the input to the iSEIR model and were able to generate the trajectory of COVID-19 cases
dynamics for the following days at midnight of February 10 based on the updated model, from
which we predicted that the turning period of CIVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan would arrive within
one week after February 14. This prediction turned to be timely and accurate, providing adequate
time for the government, hospitals, essential industry sectors and services to meet peak
demands and to prepare aftermath planning.
Our study also supports the observed effectiveness on flatting the epidemic curve by
decisively imposing the “Lockdown and Isolation Control Program” in Wuhan since January 23,
2020. The Wuhan experience provides an exemplary lesson for the whole world to learn in
combating COVID-19.

The Background and Related Literature

Infectious disease epidemics always present challenges to human society, threatening the
safety of human life and causing social upheaval and economic losses. In recent years, novel virus
outbreaks have been increasing worldwide, from the 2003 SARS-CoV, the H1N1 influenza A virus
in 2009, the MERS-CoV in 2012, the Ebola virus in 2015, the Chai virus in 2016, the H5N7 avian
influenza virus in 2017, to the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) that emerged at the end of 2019 (in
Wuhan, China). These outbreaks have brought great loss to human life, disrupted population
processes, and negatively impacted global development.
The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak began in Wuhan City (Hubei
province of China) in later December 2019 and quickly spread to other cities in China in a matter
of days. It was announced as a public health emergency of international concern by the World
Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020. Predicting the development of the
development of the outbreak as early and as reliably as possible is critical for action to prevent
its spread with necessary implementation of emergency response plan.
Furthermore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is a particularly urgent public health event.
Apart from the challenges the virus presented to China's health system, it has spread rapidly to
other regions and countries worldwide. We currently do not have a unanimous metric of
estimating when the global situation of the virus will be under control.
In this study, we like to discuss how to establish a general framework for the prediction of the
critical so-called “Turning Period” which would play a very important role in assisting better
plans for the time frame of emergence plans, in particular for associated looking forward
planning such as the battle with the current pandemics of COVID-19 worldwide.
By assessing the performance of our iSEIR model to predict the timeline of the spread of
COVID-19 in Wuhan since late December 2019 under the help of our new concept of "Turning
Time Period (Time Period)" to predict the control of the epidemic outbreak measured by a
reduction in the number of people infected, it shows that our iSEIR model (see Yuan [28] for more
in details and the brief introduction given below), an extension of the SEIR model, describes the
spread and behavior of infectious diseases for individuals under the framework of a probability
perspective works very well to accurately predicted that “the COVID-19 situation in China would
peak around mid- to late February as early as February 7, 2020”.
Indeed, we like to emphasize that the identification of the Turning Time Period is the key to
have a successful implementation for emergency plan as it provides a timeline for effective
actions and solutions to combat a pandemic by reducing as much unexpected risk as soon as
possible.
Our study also indicates that the implementation of the emergency program in the practice
associated with the “Isolation Control Program (or, say, Wuhan Quarantine Program (see Begley
[36])) “ since January23, 2020 by China in national level may be a good experiences by other
countries and regions to take a lesson.
During almost last century, in the study and modelling mechanics of infectious diseases, the
traditional model called “SEIR” denoted for “ infectious disease dynamics susceptible–exposed–
infectious–resistant” and its various (deterministic) versions have been introduced and been very
popular in analyzing and predicting the development of an epidemic (see Liu et al. [1], Murray [2],
Wu et al. [3-4], Prem et al. [5], Li et al.[6], Lin et al.[7], Kuniya [8], Roosa et al. [9] and references
wherein). The SEIR models the flows of people between four states: susceptible state variable
“S”, exposed variable “E”, infected variable “I”, and resistant variable “R”. Each of those variables
represents the number of people in those groups. Take COVID-19 as one example, assume that
the average number of exposed cases that are generated by one infected person of COVID-19,
this number could be regarded as the so-called “basic reproduction number” (which is indeed
the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals
are susceptible to infection), the study on the basic reproduction number, related features for the

globally stable endemic and disease-free equilibria and thresholds is always the main stream for
people from the academic research community to the practice in the subject of epidemic disease
spread behavior and related social issues.
In particular, a great deal and effort have been done for the study on the process and
evolution of the limits of the Basic Reproduction Number and similar thresholds in predicting
global dynamics of epidemics. In particular, since the occurrence of COVID-19 later December,
2019 in Wuhan, the study on the impact such as how serious the outbreak of infectious disease
to the society, and to prediction how many people would be infected to become infectious, and
so on, have been attracted by a large number of scholars with reports, see Cao et al. [10-11],
Cowling and Leung [12], Hermanowicz [13], Li et al. [14], Guan et al. [15] and reference wherein.
On the other hand, modelling the situation of COVID-19 and effects of different containment
strategies in China with dynamic differential equations and parameters estimation have also been
paid a lot attention by a number of scholars, e.g., see Gu et al. [17], Hu et al. [18], Zhao et al. [18],
Yan et al. [20], Wang et al. [21], Tang et al. [22], Huang et al [23], Cui and Hu [24] and related references
wherein.
In particular, Professor Murray (see [2]) leads his IHME COVID-19 health service utilization
forecasting team to work on the estimates of predicted health service utilization and deaths due to
COVID-19 by day for the next 4 months for each state in the US. Their objective is to determine the
extent and timing of deaths and excess demand for hospital services due to COVID-19 in the US (also,
see the study of Kuniya [8] on Japan, Murray [2] on USA, Wu et al. [3-4] , Prem et al. [5] on China).
It seems that almost all of them still follow the way to pay the attention mainly on modelling or
forecasting the behavior of spread for epidemic disease directly related to those infected who also
become infectious, i.e., the variable “I” of SEIR model. No study pays the attention on the study
how to establish a general framework for the prediction of the critical turning period for the spread of
pandemic diseases (e.g., the outbreak of COVID-19) in general.
The object of this paper is to fill in this gap as we do believe that it is so important to study the
general dynamics for the outbreak of COVID-19 in each country or regions, which faces one simple
expectation that how to find in which time period the battle with COVID-19 will be under controlled ?
By a simple fact that for any spread of infectious disease, we know that in general it is impossible
to find or identify the exact turning point (or critical point) for a big pandemic (which means the
behavior of the spread of COVID-19 virus is under control) due to various dynamics and
associated uncertainty! But if using the idea to think of the a time period (or say, time interval)
instead of an exact time point to identify the true change for the behavior of spread for epidemic
disease such as in terms of the number of infectious people have significantly be reduced, plus
the population of the exposed (E) are also true under the control to reach to certain low level,
then it seems possible for us to identify different phases and stages for the mechanics of the
outbreak of infectious disease incorporating with some useful tools such as the iSEIR one we
introduced in [28].
Thus the goal of this paper is to discuss how to build the framework for the prediction of the
Critical Turning Period for Outbreak of pandemics (e.g., the spread of COVID-19) based on the
application of our iSEIR Model. It expects that the concept for the prediction of the critical turning
period would provide us a better way to prepare the emergency plan for the prevention and control
of COVID-19 in the practice, such as working on the estimates of predicted health service utilization
and deaths due to COVID-19 by day for the next 4 months for each state in the US (see [2] for more
information), countries and regions worldwide.
By assessing the performance of prediction by using the iSEIR model for the timeline of the
spread’s mechanics of COVID-19 in Wuhan on dates of Feb.6 and Feb.10, 2020 by using the
concept of "Turning Time Period (Time Period)" to forecast the time frame for the control of the
epidemic outbreak measured by a reduction in the number of people infected, it shows that our
iSEIR model (an extension of the SEIR model) works very well to accurately predicted that “the
COVID-19 situation in China would peak around mid- to late February as early as February 7,
2020”. This review also shows that the identification of the Turning Time Period is the key to have

a successful implementation for emergency plan as it provides a timeline for effective actions
and solutions to combat a pandemic by reducing as much unexpected risk as soon as possible.
Our study also indicates that the implementation of the emergency program in the practice
associated with the “Isolation Control Program (or, say, Wuhan Quarantine Program ) since
January23, 2020 by China in national level may be a good experiences by other countries and
regions to take a lesson.
This paper consists of 6 sections as follows.

2. The Challenges faced by the Emergency Mechanism of Epidemic Prevention and
Control of Infectious Diseases Worldwide Today
The idea of the key “SEIR Epidemic Model” can be traced back to Dr. Ronald Ross who
received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1902 for his work on malaria which laid
the foundation for combatting the epidemic disease (see [28]). In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick
formulated a simple deterministic model called SIR to describe the dynamic mechanism for
directly transmitted viral or bacterial agent in a closed population (see [26]). Since then, scholars
have contributed and advanced this field; a significant milestone in the study of Epidemics was
the publication of “The Mathematical Theory of Infectious Diseases” in 1957 by Bailey (see [27]).
Of these, the famous SEIR model, a core subject in Epidemic discipline (see [3]), like mentioned
above, is the basis for describing the mechanism for the spread of infectious diseases, and has
been used in a number of research projects and related applications. In the SEIR model, the “S”
state refers to the susceptible group (or ignorants) who are susceptible to disease but have not
been infected yet; the “E” state refers to the exposed group who are infected but are not
infectious yet (or lurkers); the “I” state refers to those infected who also become infectious; and
the “R” state refers to those who have recovered from the infection (through treatment or natural
recovery) who may or may no longer be infectious, or those who have passed away.

2.1 The Challenges faced by the Emergency Mechanism of Epidemic Prevention and
Control
Infectious diseases have always been a major challenge to human society, threatening the
safety of human life and causing social upheaval and economic losses. Every scenario of an
epidemic outbreak due to a novel infectious disease carries a similar set of challenges: the
unknown nature of the new pathogen/strain, a lack of immediate effective treatment and vaccine,
and an ill-prepared public health infrastructure to accommodate the surge in potential patients
and need for testing. Public health policies that could alleviate and help prevent the impact and
scale of an outbreak require significant and massive governmental and societal implementation
of emergency planning and intervention strategies. At present, I want to focus the objective of
this paper towards three key issues in approaching these outbreaks:
1) How do we establish a spatiotemporal model for the infectious diseases’ outbreak: in
order describe the mechanics of the spread of infectious diseases?
2) How do we conduct numerical simulation and risk prediction indicators: in order to
conduct numerical simulation based on the real scenes, which can be used to provide an
outlook and planning schedule associated with a key period known as the “Turning Phase”
during the spread of infectious diseases?
3) How do we carry out effective predictive analysis on the epidemic situation of infectious
diseases on an ongoing basis: in order to cooperate with dynamic management, support

public health emergency plans/services, and support community responses by establishing a
coherent bigdata method for data fusion from different sources with different structure.
In combatting these outbreaks, the immediate implementation of an emergency response
mechanism delays an epidemic’s peak which affords us more time to control the epidemic by
reducing the number of infections in a concentrated period of time. Thus, a successful
emergency plan lengthens the "Turning Phase" (or say, “Turning time Period” (see [29], [30]
and also [34]), the time interval between T0 and T1. Effective ways of flattening the curve
include intervention actions such distancing or isolation programs (e.g., quarantine program
(see [33]-[35] and [36]).

Figure 1

Thus, a major challenge faced by our current responses to epidemic prevention and infectious
disease control is finding a way to predict the critical time period “Turning Period” or “Turning
Phase” when implementing an emergency plan. Knowing this timeline is critical to combat the
outbreak of an epidemic or infectious disease.
In this section, we discuss the framework for predicting the “Turning Phase” using our iSEIR
Model introduced in [28] which was used to successfully predict the “Turning Phase” for the
outbreak of epidemic COVID-19 virus from January 2020 to early of March 2020 in China using
only data from Feb. 10, 2020. Here we give a brief introduction for our iSEIR mode, which stands
for the name “individual Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Removed”.

2.2 The Framework of our iSEIR Dynamic Model with Multiplex Networks
For the convenience of our discussion, we give an introduction on the general framework of
our iSEIR model which was introduced in [28] for more in details and numerical simulations lined
to the applcations.
In one word, our iSEIR model operates under a probability perspective for each individual
with the name “individual Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Removed (iSEIR)”, which is an
extension of the classic SEIR one. The iSEIR model allows us to conduct simulations from the
individual levels located on the nodes of different community networks by incorporating its
uncertainty with the probability to conduct random simulation in the corresponding multiplex
network.

2.2.1 The Classical SEIR Model

For the SEIR model, the state S refers to the susceptible group (or ignorants) who are
susceptible to the disease but have not been infected yet; state E refers to the exposed group
who are infected but are not infectious yet; state I refers to those infected who also become
infectious; and state R refers to those who have recovered from the infection (through
treatment or natural recovery) and are no longer infectious. We also use S(t), E(t), I(t) and R(t)
to represent the proportion of the population being in state S, E, I and R at time t, respectively.
In the present case, the system of ODEs describing the dynamics of an SEIR epidemic model
thus has the following form:
𝑑𝑆
= −µ⟨𝑘⟩𝑆𝐸
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝐸
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝐼

= µ⟨𝑘⟩𝑆𝐸 − 𝛽𝐸𝐼

(1)

= 𝛽𝐸𝐼 − 𝜆𝐼
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑅

{ 𝑑𝑡 = 𝜆𝐼
where µ is the rate at which an exposed individual becomes infective, λ is the recovery rate, and
with normalization condition (each variable is in percentage change)

S (t )  E(t )  I (t )  R(t )  1

(2)

for every t  0 (since the population is considered closed).
The above deterministic SEIR model and its generalizations have received a lot of attention
from various researchers. Indeed, the SEIR model represents more accurately the spread of an
epidemic than the corresponding SIR model that does not take into account the latent period.
The SEIR model has a slower growth rate, since after the pathogen invasion the susceptible
individuals need to pass through the exposed class before they can contribute to the transmission
process, as shown (by Figure I_SEIR model illustration) below:

2.2.2 The Framework of Our iSEIR Dynamic Systems with Multiplex Networks
Based on the former discussion, the iSEIR (see Figure_II_iSEIR model Illustration below) is
an extension of SEIR model, but presented in different expression, which is a component form as
follows in Eq.(3).

As our iSEIR model is based on the framework of multiplex networks, we also give some
notations here, more in details are given in [28] (also see notations’ specification listed for the
simulations based on iSEIR given by Appendix I below).
By suppose the population S for the spreading consists of N individuals Sj, j =1, …, N; namely
S: ={ Sj, j = 1, …, N }, and also suppose these N individuals are distributed over M continuous
domains Ui, i = 1,……, M , where a domain may refer to a residential district or a network. Then

we can conduct the simulation based on framework of probability respective for each individual
based on iSEIR in a population multiplex network by following five steps:
Step 1: We first allow the transition from state S to state R directly with probability ε per unit
time (the same below) by following equation:
𝑑𝑆
= 𝐴 − 𝜇𝑆𝐸 − 𝜀𝑆
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝐸
= 𝜇𝑆𝐸 − 𝛽𝐸𝐼 − 𝛼𝐸
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝐼
= 𝛽𝐸𝐼 − 𝜆𝐼
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑅
{ 𝑑𝑡 = 𝜀𝑆 + 𝛼𝐸 + 𝜆𝐼

(5)

where A is the growth rate or new comer; 𝜀 is the probability of a susceptible person being
directly transformed into an immune person by means of e.g., isolation; µ is the rate of a
susceptible being infected; β is the rate of an infected person becoming infectious; α is the rate
of an infected person becoming immune directly; and λ is the rate of an infectious person
entering into an immune state. Figure 1 below gives a visual presentation of (5). Note that there
is no direction transition between S and I in (5) as illustrated by Figure 1 above.
Step 2: Each individual in the rumor spreading network at time t is identified by its state and
position in that state group.
Step 3: We will establish an adjacency matrix to describe the influence effects between
individuals.
Step 4: Computing the probabilities of transitions between states involves considering the
following two aspects (the K-adjacency method).
Step 4.1: the distances between uninfected individuals and their neighborhoods of infected
individuals within; and
Step 4.2: the number of individuals infected.
Step 5: The full specification of the model is given by combining steps 1 to 4 together with an
individual-level representation of (5) that is illustrated in Figure 2 above.
These five steps will help us to run the simulations for the observation of the so-called
“Supersaturation Phenomenon” under the probability perspective of all individuals by applying
iSEIR mode which help us to identify the “Turning Phase”, which are critical for any emergency
plan being successful by responding to the challenge any outbreak of pandemics under the
emergency in the practice. Thus the iSEIR will be used as a tool for us to discuss how we can
establish the framework for the prediction of the critical “Turning Phase” for the emergency
implementation response in an epidemic infectious disease outbreak described in next section.

3. The Framework for the Prediction of the Critical “Turning Phase” based on our
iSEIR Model for the Emergency Implementation Response in an Epidemic
Infectious Disease Outbreak
In this section, we discuss the framework for predicting the “Turning Phase” using our iSEIR
Model introduced in [26] which was used to successfully predict the “Turning Phase” for the
outbreak of epidemic COVID-19 virus from January 2020 to early of March 2020 in China using
only data from Feb. 10, 2020. As previously discussed, in the battle for epidemic prevention and
control of infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to implement effective prevention measures

in the early stages of an outbreak. Furthermore, identifying the beginning and ending points of
the time interval which forms the “Turning Time Period (Time Period)” lets us know how long to
expect to implement emergency protocols to effectively flatten the curve. It is possible to make
this predictive analysis of the “Turning Time Period” using the iSEIR model through the
"Supersaturation Phenomenon" elaborated below (see [28]).
3.1

The Concept of “Turning Time Period (Turing Period)” for Turning Phase

While the exact turning point (or critical point) for any infectious disease spread cannot be
precisely determined due to various dynamics and associated uncertainty, by borrowing the
variables of “Delta” and “Gamma” practiced in financial risk management (see Hull [37]) it is
possible to identify the upper and lower limits using, for example, the current tolerable degrees
from the change in new (confirmed) patients daily. These indicators then allow us to identify the
different phases and stages of an infectious disease outbreak through the iSEIR model, which we
elaborate in Part A and Part B. Through this method, it is possible to calculate the critical time
period of the “Turning Time Phase (Turning Phase).”
Part A: To Identify Different Time Phases of Epidemic Infectious Diseases Spread
We propose the identification of three general three phases (time periods) for the emergency
response of Epidemic Infectious Diseases Spread paired with medical response actions as
elaborated below:
1) The First Phase: The initial starting stage corresponds to the initial occurrence and
prepare for possible emergence plan of a new virus which may or may not transform into
a new epidemic.
2) The Second Phase: For our consideration, this is the most important phase which is the
so-called “First Half-Time Phase” otherwise known as the “Turning Phase” (or “Turning
Period”) which starts with the beginning of a possible outbreak and includes the delayed
epidemic peak by implementation of emergency planning to control the disease spread.
The First Half Time phase involves Delta and Gamma indicators (elaborated more in Part
B below) to measure the daily change in number of new patients (i.e., the indicator “Delta”),
and the rate of the daily change in number of new patients (i.e., the indicator “Gamma”).
As shown in Figure 1 above, the time interval from T0 to T1 is our Turning Phase (Turning
Period), and also makes the end of the “First Half Time Phase” for an epidemic infectious
diseases spread.
3) The Third Phase: During this stage, the epidemic infectious disease spread enters the docalled “Second Half -Time Phase”, which means the epidemic peak is gone and the rate
of spread is under greater control. This is measured in a continuously decreasing rate of
new infections per day, and ultimately leads to any but not exclusively of the following
scenarios: a): the disease completely disappears; b): an effective vaccine/treatment is
introduced; and c): the strain could also disappear and reappear cyclically in seasons, or
other reasons.
Of the three phases, the most important time period to identify is the beginning and the
ending time points of the First-Half Phase (known as the “Turning Period”). This phase is crucial
to controlling the outbreak and spread of an epidemic infectious disease after the first case of
occurrence.
Thus, being able to identify the “First Half-Phase” is crucial for the reliable prediction of the
“Turning Period” (or “Turning Phase”) as the ending time point of the Turing Period will allow us
to predict when the outbreak of the infectious disease is under the control by the level we may
settle (incorporating with ability and capability in the practice).
The next challenge to address is how to identify or predict this Turning Period.

To determine the Turning Period, we look to the occurrence of the so-called
“Supersaturation Phenomenon” (elaborated below) based on our iSEIR model (see [28]-[31] and
also the report by [34]) by running the simulation for the four control variables S(t), E(t), I(t) and
R(t) in the iSEIR model (see [28]). These variables are functions of time “t” under the probability
framework of individuals involved in the epidemic disease’s spread. Our prediction can be
achieved once we observe the so-called “supersaturation phenomenon”, the moment where
the future value range of T1 observes both E(t) and I(t) decrease. We determine this by
simulating an iSEIR model that incorporates data from the initial daily disease spread (further
explained by Part B below) (see also Figure 3 for both E(t) and I(t)) going down).

T1

Part B: The Prediction of the Turning Period by using iSEIR Model Associated with Delta and
Gamma Risk Indicators
When COVID-19 first emerged, we suggested using Delta and Gamma indicators to
measure the daily change of new patients and the change rate of the daily change for new
patients. These variables allowed us to identify the beginning point of the time interval for the
Turning Period within China. For example, to identify the starting point T0 of the Turning Period,
the level we considered for Delta was settled as no greater than 20% daily; and Gamma as no
larger than 1% daily.
Next, to predict the future ending time point T1 of the Turning Period, which measures
when the epidemic disease spread is under our control, we run numerical simulations of our iSEIR
model as shown by Figure 3. T1 is determined to be the point at which both control variables E(t)
and I(t) drop.
The combination of Part A and Part B allowed us to reliably predict the Turning Period of
COVID-19 since its first case in Wuhan (China) in late December 2019. Using only the available
data released by the National Health Commission of China from Feb. 10, 2020, we correctly
assessed that “COVID-19 peak around mid- to later February, and entering in the Second Half
Period around Feb. 20, 2020.” ( see our report [31] and confirmed by WHO’s report [34]).

To further understand our predictive simulation, we briefly describe the new idea of our iSEIR
model and the related “Supersaturation Phenomenon”.

Our iSEIR Model as a new tool to model for “Supersaturation Phenomenon”

Almost all key models such as SEIR and related mathematical tools that exist to model the
mechanics of epidemic disease spread are established under deterministic frameworks which
assume that all individual behaviors and patterns are uniform (i.e., all behaviors of individuals are
homogeneous), but this is not true as each individual’s behavior of infecting or being infected is
different. In order to have a better way of describing the dynamics of “Spreading behavior” in
multiplex network at an individual level to community to population levels, we introduced the socalled iSEIR model (individual Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Removed) which operates
under a probability perspective for each individual (see reference [28]) around two years ago as
an extension of the classic SEIR one. This iSEIR model allows us to conduct simulations from the
individual level located on the nodes of different community networks by incorporating its
uncertainty with the probability to conduct random scenarios study with consideration of the
corresponding multiplex networks. The behavior distribution of S, E, I and R can also be
numerically simulated from the iSEIR model with properly specified values of parameters on
population scales (in the change of percentage), population density, and transfer rate and so to
have the simulation results given by Figure 3 above.
Thus, the simulation results based on the iSEIR model suggest that the intensity and
extensiveness of the spread of the disease can be lowered by external intervention under a socalled “supersaturation phenomenon.” This phenomenon occurs when at some point in the
future (denoted by T1) when both of the variables “E(t)” and “I(t)” drop in value and do not
increase anymore as shown around the x-axis value of 1500 units in Figure 3.
At this value, both variables “E(t)” and “I(t)” are at the “supersaturation phenomenon.” Thus,
the “supersaturation phenomenon” in the iSEIR model allows us to predict the turning period for
the outbreak of epidemic diseases spread in the application.

4. The Study of our Prediction for the “Peak Period” of COVID-19” in China for Early
February 2020
The methodology outlined above is what we expect when modeling epidemic disease,
including COVID-19 which has become a global pandemic since the case of its first outbreak in
Wuhan in late December 2019.
Taking into account the performance of intervention controls (i.e., Wuhan quarantine program
in Hubei province (see [35])) implemented since Jan. 23, 2020 at a national level by the Chinese

government, we predicted the “Peak Time Period” of COVID-19 in China using our iSEIR model
(see [29]-[32]) in two separate reports on Feb. 6 and Feb. 10, 2020 (see [33]-[35]).
First of note, as we discussed above, we truly believe that “Turning Period” (or say, “Turning
Phase”) for COVID-19 is not a single time point, but a period of time interval associated with at
least the two following measures, “Delta” and “Gamma” explained below:
4.1 The Indicators of Delta and Gamma used to identify the Beginning Turning Point for the
“ Turning Period” of COVID-19 in China was February 1, 2020.
We borrow the concepts of “Delta” and “Gamma” which are called Greek Letters used in
financial risk management: “Delta” measures the daily change of both “E” and “I”; and “Gamma”
accounts for the speed of daily change for the number of new confirmed patients for both “E”
and “I”. In order to predict the Turning Phase for COVID-19 in China, we need to first identify the
“Starting Point” of COVID-19’s Turning Period.
By using the daily information from Jan. 23, 2020, to Feb. 6, 2020, we first observed that
“Delta” and “Gamma” were below 20% and 2% daily, respectively, for 5 consecutive days
since February 1, which led us to conclude that Feb. 1 heralds the start towards the situation
peaking, and thus we first have the following conclusion (see [29] with more in details).
Conclusion A:
Feb. 1, 2020, is the starting time point for all of China (including Wuhan, Hubei) and the
beginning Turning Point for the “ Turning Period” (see report [5] released on Feb. 7, 2020) of
COVID-19 as verified by the official daily data released by NHC of China on Feb. 28, 2020 (see
also reports from [31]-[32] and [33]-[34]).
Indeed, as the data shown below, we observed that “Delta” and “Gamma” were below 20%
and 2% respectively for 5 consecutive days since February 1. This led them to conclude that
February 1 was the starting point of the situation peaking.

4.2 The iSEIR model as a tool to predict that “the COVID-19 situation in China would peak
around mid- to late February 2020” on February 10, 2020.
Using the concept of Turning Phase and the application of the iSEIR model on February 10,
2020, based on 3 weeks of available daily data (from Jan. 23, 2020 to Feb. 10,2020) released by
NHC of China, our simulation successfully modeled the future pattern of official data released
almost 3 weeks later, as shown by the conclusion below (the reports from [29]-[30], the
corresponding simulations’ inputs by applying iSERI model given by Appendix I with
incorporation of the official data released by NHC of China as of Feb. 10, 2020).
Conclusion B:
First, with February 1, 2020, as the initial starting point of the turning point of the COVID-19
epidemic situation in China, combined with the simulation analysis of our internal model iSEIR in
considering the current situation and the “isolation control program” currently implemented in
China, the time interval for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak should be “in mid-February,
before the end of February 2020” (see also the report released by [29]-[30] for more details).
The above conclusion was reached by the following simulation analysis based on the iSEIR
model on Feb. 10, 2020 with the reports given by [29] & [30]:
The iSEIR model calculated that at the national level (excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan)
as of Feb. 10, 2020 that (see also results from simulations given by Figure below):
1. The number of infectious and asymptomatic (E) (in % change) will reach a pe
ak in about 2 days (Feb. 12, 2020), and then after about 7 days (Feb. 17, 202
0), the rate of increase will decrease to less than 10%;
2. The daily increase in the number of people infected and symptomatic (I) is a
steady downward trend, and the rate will decrease to within 10% after about
14 days (Feb. 24, 2020);
3. The proportion of people recovering from infection (R) will return to more tha
n 80% after about 17 days (Feb. 27, 2020).

where the vertical y-axis represents a standardized unit (normalized unit, it can be explained as the range from 0
to 1), the horizontal x-axis represents time, one unit is "10 minutes".

Second, as a result, we earmarked the second half of February (around Feb. 20, 2020) as the
period when the peak would happen as shown by our simulation results shown below on Feb. 10,
2020 (later confirmed by the data released by NHC of China).
Our conclusion that “the number of infectious and asymptomatic (E) (in % change) will reach
a peak in about 2 days (Feb. 12, 2020)” was confirmed by the following data released by the
National Heath Commission (NHC) of China :

The daily official data shows that Feb. 11, 2020 was the peak time with its Delta value (the
daily change for the number of close contacts people (with patients)) at 5.4% daily, the highest
value in the date range from Feb. 1 through to Feb. 25. This corroborates our prediction of around
Feb. 12, 2020 as the peak based on our iSEIR model.

4.3 The Prediction is “Turning Period, not Turning Point” in Supporting the Emergency
Response Plan in Application
Based on study above, we would like to note that our iSEIR model does not predict a specific
date for the peak of pandemic virus but rather an approximate interval encompassing a larger
time period. We believe that the so-called ‘Turning Point’ is not an accurate term; it is not a single
time point, but rather a time interval period.
This “Turning Period” of the latter half of February is backed by the World Health
Organization (WHO) whose own data shows that the Chinese cases of COVID-19 levelled off
sometime during the week of February 14. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus
also stated in a press conference on February 24 that the epidemic in China “has been declining
steadily” since February 2, 2020 (see [33]-[35]).
In a follow-up analysis to determine the accuracy of our ISEIR model using official data from
February 11–21, 2020, we produce the following findings (see also report by [32-33]):
1. Since February 17, the “Gamma” of the number of close contacts has declined
rapidly to 4% (Table3 below);
2. Since February 17, the death rate has remained within 3% (Table4 below);
3. Since February 17, the “Gamma” of the number of infected people has also de
clined to within 2–4% (Table5 below).
In addition to the fact that February 17–18 had the highest number of confirmed cases in China
(Table6), “we have reason to believe that the inflection point has emerged on February 17 and 18,
thus validating the prediction we made on February 7” (see the “statement 2.” of the findings
above) (the report given by [29-32]):

4.4 Reviewing our Analysis based on the iSEIR Model

Here we review the results based on our iSEIR model from Feb. 10, 2020. We present the
original report in two parts as follows.
4.4.1 The Outlook Report for COVID-19 as of February 10, 2020 (see [30] & [31])
Based on our iSEIR model and the data from China's novel COVID-19 epidemic released as
of Feb. 10, 2020 ([30] & [31]], we reach the following conclusions I, II, and III (and the
corresponding inputs for the simulations by applying iSEIR mode are given by Appendix I below
and incorporation with official data released by NHC of China on Feb.10, 2020).
I): COVID-19 on the National Level of China
Using 428,438 close contacts people, 42,638 confirmed infected people and 2.38%
confirmed death rate as the key input parameters on Feb. 10, 2020, our iSEIR simulation analysis

minutes,” that is, one day is "144 units"):
1) On the national level, the change in number of close contacts (E) reached a peak in
about 2 days (around Feb.12, 2020), and then after about 7 days (i.e., around Feb.17,
2020), the number of close contacts began a stable downward trend of less than 10%;
2) On the national level, the daily decrease in the number of people infected (I) is also a
steady downward trend as of date, and is within 10% after approximately 14 days
(Feb.24, 2020);
3) On the national level, the proportion of people recovering from infection (R) will quickly
return to around 80% after about 17 days (around Feb. 27, 2020).

input parameters, as of Feb. 10, 2020, our simulation analysis results show (see the figure below):
1) In Hubei Province, the number of close contacts (E) peaks after about 2 days (around
Feb. 12, 2020), and then steadily declines with a change of less than 5% after about 6
days (around Feb. 16, 2020);
2) In Hubei Province, the daily decrease of the number of people infected (I) also shows a
steady downward trend, reaching a peak in about 7 days (Feb. 17, 2020), and then
decreasing at a rate of about 7%;

4.4.2 Entering into the Second Half of the COVID-19 Outbreak on February 20, 2020
On Feb. 16, 2020, we released the report (see [31]-[32]) that, “Once the peak has been
identified, a different approach has to be taken with regard to city management, economic
development and epidemic control measures.” This is in-line with President Xi Jinping’s remarks
on Feb. 23, where he stressed the need to resume production and normal life.

Since the COVID-19 virus could be spread asymptomatically and does not yet have an
official vaccine, being able to model its trend is crucial to timeline projections. Dr. Bruce Aylward,
an epidemiologist who led a 25-member team from WHO to conduct a 9-day field study trip to
Beijing, Guangdong, Sichuan and Hubei, shared this viewpoint. "They are using big data,
artificial intelligence in places," Dr. Aylward said, "It's a technology-powered and science-driven
agile response at a phenomenal scale."(see [32]-[34]) and also the report [35]).

5. What We learned from COVID-19 in China
Our predictions based on the iSEIR model on Feb. 6, 2020, were validated by the official data
released by the NHC on COVID-19. The numbers of China and its six regions (including Hubei
Province and Hubei’s five cities: Wuhan, Xiaogun, Suizhou, Huanggang, and Huangshi) were as
follows: 76,936 confirmed patients in national level of China as of Feb. 22 (in which 64,084
confirmed cases from Hubei province) and 12,852 in other provinces, 62,8517 people with close
contacts (with patients), and a 3.17% mortality rate of confirmed infected. Our conclusions,
originally published on Feb. 16, 2020, are as follows (see [31-34]) stated by the following two
parts.

The First:
1) February 1, 2020, is the starting point for the formation of the epidemic’s Turning
(Inflection) Point which will form around mid-February (see [29] for the concept and
definition of "Turning (Inflection) Point" formation and the establishment of supporting
standard indicators);
2) We reported that the COVID-19 viral outbreak in China has reached controllable
measures in our February 16, 2020, report, and that we are now entering the secondhalf of the struggle against COVID-19 in China (see [30]-[32]).
The Second:
There appears the following similar development trends in Hubei Province, as well as in
Wuhan, Xiaogan, Suizhou, Huanggang and Huangshi (with reference to the figure below):
1) The number of close contacts (represented by "E") begins to decline rapidly after about
February 16. Then, in a short period of time, the number of close contacts follows a
stable downward change of less than 10%;
2) The daily variation of change of new confirmed infected (represented by "I") is also in a
stable downward variation. In a very short time (no more than 3 to 10 days), the number
of daily change for infected people is within the range of 10% (but higher than the
overall average).
Using the official data of the epidemic situation released as of Feb. 21, 2020, by the National
Health Commission (NHC) of China, the following three tables show the daily changes in the
number of close contacts, the number of infections, and the death rate of confirmed patients in
five cities (Wuhan, Xiaogan, Suizhou, Huanggang and Huangshi). The official data confirms the
predictive analysis reports we made on Feb. 6, and Feb. 10, 2020. Based on this, we find that:
1) Since Feb. 17, the daily variation of close contacts in all seven simulated areas has
declined rapidly to 4% (the national average change is lower than that in Hubei
Province);
2) Since Feb. 17, the death rate of confirmed patients in China has remained within 3%,
but the death rate of confirmed patients in Hubei Province is slightly higher than that
in China, which is remains at about 3.5%;

3)

Since Feb. 17, the daily variation of the number of infected people in all seven simulated
areas has also declined to within 4% (the daily variation of Wuhan is slightly higher than
that of the whole country, but that of Xiaogan, Suizhou, Huanggang and Huangshi
remains within 2%).

Therefore, we arrive at the following general conclusions:
1) Based on the number of existing confirmed cases, we determined the inflection point
to be around Feb. 17, 2020. Based on the number of existing confirmed cases in China
and Hubei Province, we used the iSEIR model on Feb. 11, 2020, to predict that Feb. 17,
and Feb. 18, 2020 would have the highest number of existing confirmed cases in China
and Hubei Province respectively. Today (as of Feb. 22, 2020), the number of existing
confirmed cases and the highest confirmed cases in China and Hubei Province have

been reduced by more than 5,700 and 5,000 respectively. Considering the three-day
screening in Hubei Province from Feb.17, to 19, 2020, we have reason to believe that
the true Turning (Inflection) Point based on the number existing confirmed cases
emerged at approximately Feb. 17, 2020.
2)

Through a comprehensive analysis of Hubei province, we determine the traditional
inflection point to be between Feb. 17, and Feb. 19, 2020. This data set combined with
the previous conclusion lead us to believe that the COVID-19 infection in China
(including Wuhan, Hubei) has been fully controlled since mid-February 2020, with Feb.
18 as the most precise date (we arrive at Feb. 18 as after Feb. 17, the daily change of
confirmed patients is less than 1% in negative numbers).

6. Final Concluding Remarks based on our COVID-19 Predictions in China
We believe that our iSEIR model is a reliable predictor for the Turning Period of the struggle
against COVID-19 through introducing concepts of “Turning Phase” and “Supersaturation
Phenomenon”. This model accounts for intervention policies and methods such as isolation
control programs (e.g. quarantine); such as those implemented in February 2020 in China (see
[33] - [34]). Beyond using our iSEIR model for the COVID-19 in China from late December to
early March 2020, we hope to further apply it to outbreaks worldwide.
When we incorporate the public official data released by the Chinese government since
January 23, 2020, our iSEIR simulation allowed us to conclude that:

February 1, 2020, is the starting point for the formation of the turning point of the
COVID-19 epidemic situation in China. Considering the intervention efforts
implemented at the state-level, the time period for the control of the COVID-19
epidemic should be around mid-February 2020, and at least by the end of February 2020
(see the original report released [30]-[32] for more details).
Before arriving at our final remarks, we want to consider the following with regards to the
current global state of the COVID-19 outbreak:
1) The virus can be spread by infected and asymptomatic individuals;
2) At current, there is no fully effective medicine or treatment; and
3) No vaccine.
With these conditions, it is important that our iSEIR model be used to aid in modeling the
timeline of the COVID-19 outbreak in other countries in shaping public policy. However, we
acknowledge that our model is patterned to reflect effective intervention methods and
protocols such as the “Wuhan Quarantine” (see [36]). In conclusion, the simulated timeline
provided by our iSEIR model best fits outbreak scenarios where early adoption of public health
controls and restrictions are implemented to flatten the curve.
Finally, we want to reinforce that emergency risk management is always associated with the
implementation of an emergency plan. The identification of the Turning Time Period is key to
emergency planning as it provides a timeline for effective actions and solutions to combat a
pandemic by reducing as much unexpected risk as soon as possible. We can further improve our
ability to emergency-plan in urgent events, such as in the control of an infectious disease
outbreak like COVID-19 in three key areas:
1) a better spatiotemporal model to describe the mechanics of the spread of infectious
diseases;
2) an efficient way to conduct numerical simulation to identify the “Turning Time Period
(Phase)” for the emergency event, e.g., the timeframe for the outbreak of infectious
diseases spread such as OVID-19 virus; and

3)

carrying out effective predictive analysis by establishing a coherent bigdata method for
data fusion from different sources with different structures to support a dynamic
management to respond to daily issues with effective emergency planning.
