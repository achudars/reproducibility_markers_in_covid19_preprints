Abstract
Objectives Review, compare and critically assess digital technology responses to the COVID-19 pandemic around the world.
The specific point of interest in this research is on predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare
solutions. This point is supported by failures from the past, where the separate design of digital health solutions has led to lack
of interoperability. Hence, this review paper investigates the integration of predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable
digital healthcare systems. The second point of interest is the use of new mass surveillance technologies to feed personal data
from health professionals to governments, without any comprehensive studies that determine if such new technologies and data
policies would address the pandemic crisis.
Method This is a review paper. Two approaches were used: A comprehensive bibliographic review with R statistical methods of
the COVID-19 pandemic in PubMed literature and Web of Science Core Collection, supported with Google Scholar search. In
addition, a case study review of emerging new approaches in different regions, using medical literature, academic literature, news
articles and other reliable data sources.
Results Most countries’ digital responses involve big data analytics, integration of national health insurance databases, tracing
travel history from individual’s location databases, code scanning and individual’s online reporting. Public responses of mistrust
about privacy data misuse differ across countries, depending on the chosen public communication strategy. We propose predictive, preventive and personalized solutions for pandemic management, based on social machines and connected devices.
Solutions The proposed predictive, preventive and personalized solutions are based on the integration of IoT data, wearable
device data, mobile apps data and individual data inputs from registered users, operating as a social machine with strong security
and privacy protocols. We present solutions that would enable much greater speed in future responses. These solutions are
enabled by the social aspect of human-computer interactions (social machines) and the increased connectivity of humans and
devices (Internet of Things).
Conclusion Inadequate data for risk assessment on speed and urgency of COVID-19, combined with increased globalization of
human society, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Despite an abundance of digital methods that could be used in slowing or
stopping COVID-19 and future pandemics, the world remains unprepared, and lessons have not been learned from previous cases
of pandemics. We present a summary of predictive, preventive and personalized digital methods that could be deployed fast to
help with the COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Introduction
With the rise of COVID-19, most western governments seem
determined to design apps and surveillance mechanisms as a
means of response. During the first wave of the COVID-19
pandemic, these proved successful in some countries including Taiwan, South Korea and China. Western countries are
developing similar monitoring and surveillance approaches,
hoping to replicate that success and prevent significant damage from rising risks of a second wave. With monitoring as the
main drive, we could be limiting the potential for pandemic
management. Designing separate systems in isolation could
lead to the realization that such systems are coupled by default. But by being designed in isolation, such systems become proprietary and not interoperable with similar systems
built by others. This can also result in the repeat of past cybersecurity mistakes. We investigate interoperability in predictive, preventive and personalized medical system design,
which could become the topic of concern when upgrading the
same systems we are building today, for pandemic management at the latter stages of this outbreak or future outbreaks.

The case of COVID-19
COVID-19 was declared as an outbreak in January 2020 by
the World Health Organization (WHO). Within 6 weeks, it
became a pandemic, and by mid-March 2020, the COVID19 pandemic had generated 24 times more cases than the
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak [1]. One
of the differences is that the amount of digital data produced in
the time period prior to and during SARS in 2003 is produced
within minutes today in 2020 [1]. Big data has enabled
geospatial mapping of COVID-19 for epidemic transition
analysis, but challenges remain in ‘data aggregation, knowledge discovery, and dynamic expression’ [2]. There is also an
opinion that many countries did not learn from the previous
two coronavirus pandemics (Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS), resulting in an inadequate risk
assessment of the urgency and the speed of the pandemic
[3]. Taiwan on the other hand has learned from the SARS
pandemic and has developed a fast response health mechanism that recognized the crisis and activated emergency measures to contain the outbreak [4].

Digital solutions for the COVID-19 outbreak
This review paper is looking for digital solutions that enhance
the speed of response during pandemics. Fast information
flow is needed for understanding the dynamics and development of an epidemic and to aid prevention, control, and
decision-making and for informing actions. This research
studies interoperability of digital health solutions and the benefits from integration of these systems. A lack of data in the

EPMA Journal (2020) 11:311–332

initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak led to its initial rapid
spread across the world. Despite the abundance of digital solutions for preventing future pandemics, the world remains
unprepared. A specific focus in this study is the speed of
response enabled by the social aspect of human-computer interactions (e.g. social machines) and the increased connectivity of humans and devices (e.g. IoT).

The role of connected devices and social networks
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to technologies with sensing, networking, computing, information processing and intelligent control capabilities. IoT is commonly used to describe various smart objects and things, with computational
abilities, that exchange information, potentially even on a
global level, perceiving the world as one adaptive and interconnected system [5]. This communication and exchange of
information is done via different protocols including WAN,
LAN/LoRaWAN, Bluetooth, Z-Wave, INSTEON, ZigBee,
Wi-Fi, 4G and 5G. When social networks are integrated with
the IoT, a new concept emerges, named Social Internet of
Things (SIoT). The SIoT potential architecture, policy and
network structure have already been tested with simulations
[6]. These simulations show that SIoT depends on the type of
relationship (e.g.) Ownership object relationship (OOR);
Social object relationship (SOR); Co-work object relationship
(C-WOR); Co-location object relationship (C-LOR); and
Dynamic Social Structure of Things (DSSoT). The ‘Social
Collaborative Internet of Things’ (SCIoT) goes even further
in respect that social objects are grouped and collaborate by
interacting and sharing [7], in other words, working as cognitive coupled systems. These concepts emerge as values in the
advancements of smart healthcare monitoring and management systems that are using big data analytics, such as
iHealth and m-Health [8]. The diversity of SIoT
implementations points to problems of scale and interoperability in terms of aggregation of data for responding to a
pandemic.

Methodology
This is a review paper, investigating different approaches taken across the world in managing the COVID-19 pandemic
with digital technologies. To forecast events, digital technologies currently use artificial intelligence (AI) to process large
amounts of data. However, AI applications require narrowly
defined use cases and large training datasets to ‘teach’ the app
how to forecast. This would result in a slow adaptability of AI
to managing a new and fast-changing pandemic. To use AI in
pandemic management, social machines and connected devices will require a different approach to AI training, for example, selective re-purposing of AI systems already trained

EPMA Journal (2020) 11:311–332

for other uses, like temperature measurement. A social machine is defined as ‘an environment comprising humans and
technology interacting and producing outputs or action which
would not be possible without both parties present’.1
As we have seen with most mobile app concepts for pandemic management, they depend on human and technology
interaction at scale, that is, with mass participation by large
segments of the population. To achieve the targets of the UK’s
digital contact tracing programme, for instance, it was anticipated that a minimum adoption rate of 60%2 of the UK population was needed.3 However, where such apps require the
capture and sharing of sensitive data with various entities such
as the government, potential users can become wary and reluctant to participate. One study found that over 70% citizens
were unwilling to download contact tracing apps.4 Since this
data is already shared by many humans on social media and
mobile apps, this opens up questions on how to design a
privacy preserving contact tracing app that ensures that a sufficient percentage of humans will download the pandemic
management app. To investigate this, we refer to social science methods and relate the concept of social machines, with
digital health and pandemic management. An additional approach is to use standard open-source intelligence (OSINT) to
gather data that is available in the public domain.5 This includes searches to public repositories of Internet-exposed and
vulnerable IoT devices (for instance, shodan.io).

Social machines in digital health for pandemic
management
Global pandemic management requires fast data and knowledge acquisition with real-time visualization of results. This
can be achieved by interactive spatial transmission and social
management of data in geographic information systems [9].
This relates to the ‘Social Internet of Things’ (SIoT), which
integrates people and smart devices interacting within a social
structure of IoT, often through IoT platforms [10, 11]. The
‘Social Collaborative Internet of Things’ (SCIoT) represents
a more advanced form of SIoT where social objects collaborate, interact and share information, creating cyber-physical
ecosystems [12].
Social machines are human-machine communities on the
web (e.g. Wikipedia). These often change, like living hybrid
organisms, and may be represented as cyber-physical and
socio-technical systems [13]. Such systems can be observed

through a plurality of archetypal narratives [14]. The SIoT
utilizes users’ needs, preferences, social drives and the surrounding environment to generate situation-aware services
[15]. This refers to cognitive reasoning within temporary social structures, combining users, objects and services in the
form of a ‘Dynamic Social Structure of Things’ [15].
Cognitive collaboration between connected devices can be
achieved by combining machine learning with middleware
technologies [12]. Some studies even suggest the creation of
emotional models for human-machine interactions [16, 17], as
expressed in Table 1. Such human-machine interactions could
provide valuable feedback for pandemic monitoring apps.
The social networks described in Table 1 have large numbers of participants and can provide answers to complex problems [6]. Hence, when designing pandemic monitoring apps,
we should focus on the value of this human-computer interaction for large numbers of participants and a wide range of
devices. An approach to managing new mass surveillance
technology that links personal data would be to enable the
consolidation of connected devices into virtual objects for
remote access and control. This could create a dynamic virtual
network connecting different domains and facilitating sharing
of resources in a cloud environment [18]. This would allow us
to initiate the development of a truly global response and
monitoring of pandemics.

Social collaborative Internet of Things and artificial
intelligence
The SIoT opens new opportunities, such as fast and diverse
application development though a dynamic end-to-end connection between devices. For example, there is already a consensus among Chinese experts that Internet of Things (IoT)
can help in diagnosis and treatment of the pandemic [9]. The
SIoT enhances the IoT with improved intelligence, contextawareness and cognitive reasoning [15], such as an IoT cognitive hierarchy thinking mechanism [19]. Some include using
social network theory for social relations of mobile nodes in
IoT [20]. If we consider the concept of mechatronics, where
functionality is transferred from the machine system into an
information systems [21], then the SIoT already represents a
form of cognitive engine. Cognition in the form of an awareSIoT that perceives time, space and activity, depends on building social relationships between ‘things’ [20].
Cognition in SIoT could resolve many social issues. For
example, one such issue is incorrect self-diagnosis through
personal digital health data. This creates increased and sometimes unsustainable demand for medical practitioners. At best
such information could be used by clinicians for understanding a patient’s lifestyle [22]. Cognition in health social machines could prevent the damage of self-diagnosis and instead
provide tailored interventions by de-coupling activity data into
a consolidated longitudinal archive for an integrated approach

to ‘intervention, management, mitigation and sense-making’
[22], supported with FAIR stewardship for distributed data
analytics [23]. With the advancements in machine moral mind
[24], and criteria to evaluate the health of a social machine
[25], the interactions with social machines could evolve into a
meaningful communication based on moral agency, where
humans act as a ‘cognitive anchor’, noting that even humans
need models for mental behaviour [24].

Social collaborative Internet of Things and quality of
experience in digital healthcare
The SIoT operates in a way that is similar to how humans
interact with social networks. The physical social connections
between humans and things represent the baseline for the logical configurations of social communities, involving humans
and things [17]. The logical configuration adopts individual
social network behaviours into a universal social network of
all entities [17]. The IoT contains many aspects of social networking, where value emerges from the exchanges between
users and devices, enabling service that would be of more
interest because of interactive filtering (e.g. embedded systems gathering and analysing data before communicating to
social networks of people and devices), to provide better quality of experience [17].

Whilst it is likely that during rapidly unfolding crises, aspects other than service design will be given priority in the
design and deployment of new digital interventions, it is well
established that ease of use and user experience, combined
with a perceived value for participants, could increase uptake
and adherence, resulting effectiveness of such interventions.
Moreover, since the effectiveness of such interventions depends on high rates of user adoption, rapid uptake and participation are crucial. Thus, systems designed for gathering personal data during pandemics should provide value and quality
of service to encourage more participants. Participants could
also be encouraged by different systems of trust. There are
various schemes of trust, with diverse trust scaling, dimensions, inferences and semantic meanings [26]. For example,
for trust in social networks, Amazon and eBay use star ratings;
P2P networks measure quality of downloaded files and speed.
Some medical devices are considered IoT devices. There
are many challenges identifying what closed or open source
software is running in medical devices and other IoT devices
in the industry. The list of software used in any device (including non-IoT devices) is referred to a software bill of materials (SBOM). Vendors and consumers lack awareness of
not only the software components they are using and adopting
but also the underlying security vulnerabilities that affect such
software. The National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (part of the United States Department of

EPMA Journal (2020) 11:311–332

Commerce) is leading an effort to provide guidelines to producers and consumers of technology on how to create effective SBOMs that can help identify the presence of known
security vulnerabilities.6 This effort is divided into four major
working groups: framing; awareness and adoption; formats
and tooling; and healthcare proof of concept.
The healthcare proof-of-concept working group created a
report that provides information on SBOM creation by the
MDMs; consumption by the healthcare delivery organizations
(HDO); and the exercising of the procurement, asset management, risk management and vulnerability management use
cases. Challenges and areas for improvement were identified
and documented around an absence of naming standards, partial version information, vulnerability vs exploitation qualification, configuration vulnerabilities, no authoritative end of
life database and lack of patching level data.7

Pandemics and socio-economic hardships
COVID-19 has triggered a significant shock in the economy
with social distancing and quarantine policies triggering economic recession. Economic hardship could harden the impact
of pandemics, and digital technologies provide some solutions
for increasing economic value during global pandemics.
While current focus is on pandemic management, with the
increased focus on digital management of the COVID-19,
significant focus is also placed on connected devices and
IoT. Prior to the pandemic, it was estimated that IoT will
create a value in 2020 projected at 1.9 trillion USD [27] with
connected IoT devices reaching 20.8 billion in 2020 [28].
These connected devices and social networks enable data collection and exchange that was not possible during previous
pandemics, and this represents a different healthcare business
ecosystem. Healthcare business models need to adapt accordingly to secure ethical access to this new value.
Some of the areas of focus to secure ethical access to this
new value are in monitoring and control, big data for business
analytics, information sharing and collaboration [29], among
many other value areas. Harnessing the IoT potential also requires a digital strategy; for example, the cloud offers value in
high-scale real-time analytics of big data, and IoT middleware
offers lightweight real-time analytics [30]. Cloud IoT also enables a vision for worldwide IoT integration [31]. Apart from
the medical and business side, there is also a social value from
IoT social connection and networking, which can be explored
by combining social computing with opportunistic IoT, for
analysing the physical and digital social communities simultaneously [32]. By adding intelligence in objects, smart objects
collect data, interact and control the physical world while symbiotically sharing data and being interconnected with other

315

things [33], though a diverse set of communication technologies that enable remote management [33].

Cyber risk from digital solutions in pandemic
management
With the integration of large numbers of social IoTs in a digital healthcare design, a large data distribution platform can be
subjected to a relatively simple large-scale attack, triggering a
huge economic cost and even loss of life [34]. These emerging
risks from IoT in healthcare ecosystems need to be understood
in the digital solutions design process. One way to understand
these risks is through existing reference architectures for attack surface analysis [35]. Cloud IoT ecosystems are seen as
pervasive and disruptive, enabling many different applications
that are gaining momentum, but with many issues surrounding
privacy and security [36]. There are however existing cyber
risk assessment approaches for smart systems [37], for IoT
systems [38] and for cloud provider environments [39]. The
use of these could enhance the privacy of digital heath solutions. SIoT is in the same risk category. SIoT objects can
anonymously establish communications and cooperate opportunistically with neighbouring IoT devices, but trust management in SIoT is a concern [7]. Therefore, existing performance
metrics for security operations analysis [40] and failsafe recommendations [41] should be consulted in the design of digital heath solutions.

Case study of digital solutions in pandemic
management
Two data sources were used extensively in case studies: (1)
the Google Scholar search engine and (2) a critical appraisal of
Publons’ new COVID-19 publication index that investigates
sound scientific practices of preprints and papers. As COVID19 is a global and fast-spreading pandemic, as visualized in
Fig. 1, the case study research is not focused on investigating
individual region responses in great detail. We designed the
diagram in Fig. 1, with data from this study, using the
‘draw.io’ open access web software.8The different lines represent the spread of COVID-19 regionally, nationally and internationally, leading to a global pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally (demonstrated conceptually in Fig. 1, without reliance on concrete
data) even before most governments realized the need to act;
for example, at the time of writing, the first known case in
France was in December 2019, almost a month before the
French government announced the first case in France.9

Therefore, studying regional approaches in detail at this stage,
when we do not truly understand the data, would probably not
produce the results that we require. Instead, focus was placed
on the regions that performed best during the initial outbreak,
with the objective to gather and accumulate knowledge on the
effectiveness of different methods and with the aim of making
recommendations for replicating this success in the second
wave.

The case of COVID-19 in Taiwan – Role of social machines in digital democracy
The Taiwanese culture of civic technology, a fusion of technology, activism and civic participation, created a strong response to COVID-19 [42]. The vTaiwan digital democracy
platform [43] presents a decentralized community of participants. The platform hosts social machines that uncover a problem and then help participants to understand this problem,
even while the situation is changing daily or hourly. Taiwan
implemented actions (interventions) with great speed through
the platform [43]. Some of the actions were aimed at reducing
panic buying, such as the application programming interface
(API) that provided real-time, location-specific data to the
public on critical items’ availability. To design the interactive
face mask maps, for example, the digital minister worked with
hacktivists through a digital chatroom.
A second example of success was a bottom-up information
sharing platform on which individuals created a strong participatory collective action for sharing real-time reports about
symptoms using social smartphone apps, call-in lines and other approaches. The results were integrated with location history by community-created apps, enabling individuals to track
and compare their exposure. This approach supported

proactive behaviour, where people who were concerned about
being exposed had a tool to determine if they should selfisolate prior to developing symptoms. The authorities also
had a tool to monitor people in self-isolation with a mobile
phone–based ‘electronic fence’ that traces mobile phone signals to track location and follow up with two phone calls every
day to make sure people stay home. The Taiwanese system
sends alerts to police if self-quarantined people leave their
home, and the police would contact or visit the person within
15 min of the alarm being triggered. The Taiwanese ‘electronic fence’ system could be the first in the world designed for
this purpose.10
The success factor for such large-scale social coordination
was the common-sense approach and the privacy protection of
participating individuals. This platform reduced economic impact greatly, through successful containment that avoided social distancing measures. People either self-isolated, avoided
or disinfected contaminated locations, depending on their location history review. The community data enabled more
targeted responses that have proven more effective than in
all other economies, including the USA, the EU and China,
at least in the first wave. The case of Taiwan has proven that
social inputs and coordination can prove more effective in
resolving complex fast-evolving problems than centrally run
top-down approaches that take a while to deliver and, in some
regions, lack buy in by the population. Further, the
community-driven development of software tools in this case
was proven to be fast and precise, driven by society
participation.

This review paper is focused on the human-computer interactions in pandemic management, where technology creates
value when built into social machines, where a large number
of participants adding input in mobile apps. However, it is
worth mentioning that AI and ML can also add value in purely
digital approaches to solving problems. AI/ML applications
generally work best with narrowly defined use cases accompanied by large, hand-built training datasets to ‘teach’ an application how to execute against its use case. This results in
slow adaptability of AI/ML to new opportunities, unless an
existing capability can be re-purposed. For example, consider
the Kogniz Health product11―a stand-alone infrared digital
camera with an integrated ML trained to identify passers-by
who show signs of fever and send alerts in real time via a
variety of standard messaging tools. The ML capability is
possibly re-purposed from an existing ML use case to monitor
and alert on temperature variations beyond acceptable limits
in an industrial setting. This approach could work in advanced
economies because of partially existing infrastructure, strong
know how and technological/financial strength. But it is difficult to see how these tools can be made operational in developing countries, at the required speed.

The case of COVID-19 in the UK
Given the lack of treatment such as a vaccine for COVID-19,
the world’s current focus is on global surveillance, and IoT and
other new technologies including thermal cameras or IoT sensors [44], and face recognition [45], that can play a crucial part
in mapping the spread of infection, and in detecting disease
early as part of smart systems with near real-time data tracking
and alerts [3]. Currently IoT-enabled drones are used for public
surveillance, enforcing quarantines and even for faster
disinfecting with agricultural drones. IoT can be used for
enforcing compliance of infected people in quarantine, by monitoring and tracing potential infections caused by breach in
quarantine. The speed and scale of IoT connectivity could enhance the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) ability to monitor high-risk patients in home quarantine. This is currently
done with healthcare workers going door-to-door, posing a risk
to them, and using up resources for home checks that could turn
out to be unnecessary. IoT real-time live cameras could be used
for patient checks, cloud databases could be used for patients to
upload their temperature measured on home thermometer, and
drones could be used to check temperature with infrared cameras. The aggregated IoT mobile data from infected patients can
be used for tracing people who might have been in contact with
infected patients. The IoT is already used for remote monitoring
of in-house patients with serious conditions. Self-reporting apps
such as the ‘C-19 COVID symptom tracker’ enable quick
11
https://www.eenewseurope.com/news/ai-based-cameras-scan-crowdsCovid-19-fever

317

buildup of maps and other data that support people to prevent
infection and medical professionals to plan their response. One
of the main benefits from app design that operates as a social
machine is the speed of deployment and data collection. For
example, the UK ‘Covid Symptom Tracker’ app reached
700,000 downloads and app registrations in 24 h [46]. It is
almost impossible to gather such large datasets with any of
the traditional data collection tools. But societal participation
in data collection, during times of crises, seems to be producing
relevant data at a very fast rate.
Earlier attempts were different in approach. For example, a
mobile phone application called FluPhone App [47] used
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals to track human interactions and
asked users to report symptoms. The data collected was used
for understanding how diseases spread in complex human
network structures, using information such as how frequently
people meet and how much time they spend together. One of
the main weaknesses in this approach is that smartphones can
accurately determine location between 7 and 13 m [48], and
COVID-19 spreads in people that are within less that 2-m
proximity [49]. Tracing Bluetooth and Wi-Fi location also
does not always help with mapping objects in movement
(e.g. flights, trains and buses).

The case of COVID-19 in China – Role of IoT in social
machines
The Chinese approach for compulsory registration of phone
numbers to an app, prior to using public transport, and allocating colour codes through social media apps, could be more
effective in using big data for automated forecasting of contagion risk, but it triggers privacy concerns [1]. The Chinese
approach is enabled through the wallet app Alipay and the
social media, messaging and mobile payment app WeChat.
The apps display a code that can be read by smartphones: green
means unrestricted and yellow or red implies a need to selfquarantine or be in a supervised quarantine. Codes are based
on tracing location history to determine contacts with outpatients or people hospitalized in the past 14 days and are
refreshed every day at midnight. Many restaurants, coffee shops
and shopping malls require to see a green code to enter. But
there are already concerns about glitches and incorrect codes
that ban people from travelling or entering public spaces,
While the Chinese approach for digital epidemic control
has triggered privacy concerns and mistrust, similar public
response can be expected in the EU and USA where people
have even lower level of trust in their governments [1]. This
mistrust can be fuelled even more with the increased attacks
against individuals working from home during the pandemic.12 There is also a big difference in how such cyber-attacks
12

318

are mitigated. One malware sample we discovered was a wiper designed to destroy infected systems. The malware was
aimed at people working from home but also at healthcare
organizations. The filename ‘冠状病毒.exe’ which translates
to ‘coronavirus’ uses several techniques to delete data from
both the file system and registry in an attempt to disrupt system operations. The Taiwanese approach has on the other
hand caused far less mistrust despite involving big data analytics, the integration of national health insurance databases,
access to travel history from individual’s location databases,
code scanning and online reporting. The main difference between the EU, the USA, China and Taiwan on the other hand
is the difference in public communication strategies [1].

The case of COVID-19 in South Korea – Social machines and IoT in smart cities
South Korea was one of the countries where COVID-19
started early in the global outbreak, and their experience with
SARS has proven effective in lowering the death rate through
strict quarantine and fast testing. South Korea deployed a
tracking app called Corona100m (Co100), informing people
of known cases within 100 m of their location.13 Further tracking measures included a ‘smart city technology system’ that
uses surveillance camera footage and credit cards transactions
to track past movement of infected patients.14 These tools are
in addition to the Coronamap15 website tracing the location
history of the infected and the information search engine
Coronaita16 designed specifically for finding information on
infected areas.

The role of tech companies in COVID-19 pandemic
management
The Chinese response to COVID-19 has shown that information systems for pandemic management, in terms of database
and spatial analysis and mapping, can be designed and made
operational fast but is limited by the commercial software that
is in existence [2]. Some of the main challenges are the largescale people flow globally, the long incubation period of this
virus, lack of symptoms in some of the infected, virus reoccurrence after recovery, evolving nature of the virus targeting
different DNAs and the different level of impact on individuals. If pandemic tracking information system is designed to
operate regionally, its functions are limited in global pandemic
prevention monitoring.

Statistical bibliometric analysis of scientific
research records
Two different software tools were heavily used for a bibliographic review of the types of data used in pandemic management: (1) R Studio was used with the ‘bibliometrix’ [50] package to analyse the large sets of data records, and (2) a computer programme for bibliometric mapping called VOSviewer
[51] was used for graphically representing large data records
in a bibliometric map. The Web of Science Core Collection
was identified as the data source for the two different software
tools. The data search parameters were narrowed to search for
articles on COVID-19 in 2020. Then, a historic search parameter was used to identify methods applied in research on previous pandemics.
From the first search result, we searched for ‘COVID-19’,
and out of 2264 records, we used the Web of Science filter and
downloaded the most relevant 500 records. When analysed
with the R ‘bibliometrix’ package, we selected two most striking figures. In Fig. 2, we can see a three-fields plot of keywords, topics and countries.
To compare the three-fields plot analysis with alternative
mapping of scientific research on COVID-19, we designed a
graph by corresponding author countries Fig. 3.
To compare these results, with the entire 2254 records on
the Web of Science Core Collection, we used the Web of
Science result analysis tool and found similar results as seen
in Fig. 4.
Although in Figs. 2 and 3, China is shown as the dominating country in the scientific research on COVID-19, we compared the three-fields plot analysis, by using the same data file
of records and designed a collaboration network as a social
structure Fig. 5. What is clear from Fig. 5 is that the UK is
performing strongest in collaborative research on COVID-19,
and this collaboration is strongly represented between the UK,
the USA and Canada.
We continued this analysis by doing a historical search on
the Web of Science Core Collection for scientific research on
global pandemics. This resulted with 3708 records, and we
used the Web of Science tool for research analysis (see
Fig. 6). The historic analysis showed that countries that have
led the scientific research on global pandemics in the past are
not represented as strongly as China in the scientific research
on COVID-19. Since China was first affected in this global
pandemic, we could speculate that regional research effort is
driven by the effect of the pandemic. It is possible that other
countries would pick up and start producing more scientific
research, but such comparison can only be confirmed when
data becomes available. At present, these graphs represent
statistical analysis of the current data, as a snapshot in time,
compared with historical analysis in Fig. 6.
What is concerning from the results of this statistical analysis of scientific research is the extremely low record numbers

3708 historical records on global pandemics on the Web of
Science Core Collection, with 372,454 results on business,
573,901 results on art and 455,356 records on fishing, then
the problem becomes concerning. The world simply does not
seem prepared for COVID-19, not to mention a deadlier global pandemic. Similar conclusions are presented in our review
of new forms of digital data used in pandemic management.

Types of digital data in pandemic management
In this section we detail our search for scientific research using
digital data. Firstly, such data does exist. Digital healthcare
(e.g. e-Health, m-Health, Telemedicine) includes management of large, heterogeneous, distributed, multiscale and multimodal datasets distributed across edge-fog-cloud healthcare
paradigms [52]. Complementing such paradigms, smart cities

320

generate vast amounts of data, captured and stored in different
heterogenous formats that need to be transformed to be of
analytical value [53]. IoT and big data analytics are emerging

trends in new biomedical and healthcare technologies [54].
These various different types of data need to be integrated to
ensure fast and effective response during pandemic

management. Although there are concerns about data privacy,
there are many types of data that are already shared openly in
different community settings (e.g. skill set, goods sold, vehicles movement). Some personal data needs to be evaluated
with specific privacy requirements in consideration, but there
is also a lot of data shared in open community marketplaces
[55].
Focusing on one specific data type (e.g. big data) would not
necessarily result in low latency. Adding to this, the peerreviewed scientific research on individual data sources is still
in its infancy, and the COVID-19 pandemic is already causing
deaths globally. Currently, there are only five scientific publications on the Web of Science Core Collection under the
search on ‘COVID-19 and big data’. We reviewed all five
publications, and only one actually discussed big data solutions. This one publication is only a viewpoint, not a research
article. A similar search on ‘pandemics and big data’, using
historical records since 1900 (to 2020), produced only 59
records. On the other hand, search results on ‘big data’ alone
produced 88,410 records. It is unclear if this result is caused
by lack of funding or lack of interest in the past on this research topic. Hence, we continued with different search parameters, and here we discuss few different types of data that
need to be integrated in the pandemic management analytical
processes, but the scientific research on these topics is very
limited.
Time-stamped data refers to data that includes the event
time (the time of the event) and processed time (the time data
was processed). By recording the time of capture and time of
collection, data analytics could recreate location journey, by
replaying people’s steps and even derive findings on estimating or predicting best future actions. Our search on the Web of
Science Core Collection, on the topic of ‘COVID-19 and
time-stamped data’, resulted in no results, while the search

of historic records, from 1900 to 2020, on ‘pandemic and
time-stamped data’, resulted in only 3 records.
Genomics data that involves analysing the DNA of patients
could identify new drugs and improve healthcare with personalized treatment. But converting genomic data into value is
challenging, because of the large volume of data that requires
significant processing resources, combined with the need to
unify diverse teams from bioinformatics data specialists, to
clinical specialists on the front line. Nevertheless, significant
progress has already been made. Sequencing the first genome
took longer than a decade. With current tools, it takes just
2 days despite these limitations in handling large data.
Despite these advancements, our search on the Web of
Science Core Collection, on the topic of ‘COVID-19 and genomics data’, resulted in 0 results, while the search of historic
records, from 1900 to 2020, on ‘pandemic and genomics data’, resulted with 43 records. A similar search on ‘COVID-19
and high-dimensional data’ also resulted in no records, and the
search of historic records, from 1900 to 2020, on ‘pandemic
and high-dimensional data’ resulted in only two records.
However, to quote a famous aphorism frequently used in this
context [56], the ‘absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence’. We are aware that the data is currently
incomplete so we cannot assume for sure that the research is
not happening. We will run this analysis again in a year and
see how it has changed and how it compares to previous
pandemics.
Healthcare data contains a large number of interrelated variables (e.g. weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels). To investigate the connection between intraday physical activity
and sleep, actigraphy data was applied to a Bayesian framework for function-on-scalars regression [57], resulting in
many proposed predictors. Similarly, it is possible to check
an individual for the expression of thousands of genes,

322

resulting in millions of possible gene combinations, some of
which may be predictors. This is described as highdimensional data, where the number of features exceeds the
number of observations.
To observe high-dimensional data for pandemic management, one would need to analyse multiple measured and recorded parameters including, for example, immune system
status, genetic background, diagnosed diseases, operations,
treatments, blood analysis, nutrition and alcohol-tobacco drug
consumption. Open sharing of such personal medical data
would require people to trust in technologies such as the secure multiparty computation (also known as privacypreserving computation)17 and differential privacy.18 Such
technologies could enable a broader interpretation, based on
trust in privacy preserving technologies. More work needs to
be done on identifying and promoting the benefits for private
individuals to start sharing openly medical data. Genetic data
and personal biodata privacy are evaluated with a unique moral obligation for protecting patients’ dignity, and there are
ethical limits on how such data can be shared [58].
Analytic transactional (transact and analyse) data comes in
handy in resolving this issue in the healthcare environment.
Analytic transactional data enables shifting real-time processing with new metrics and in-memory computing. Instead of
using one technology to run applications, and separate technology to run batch analysis, creating linked layers and a
patched system, analytic transactional data analysis uses a
single layer for transactions and analytics. This approach
would enable monitoring health indicators in real time while
performing other functions simultaneously. Despite its scientific usefulness, the search on ‘COVID-19 and analytic transactional data’ and the search of historic records, from 1900 to
2020, on ‘pandemic and analytic transactional data’ both resulted in no records. The search was repeated with multiple
terms (e.g. ‘analytic transactional’, and ‘translytic’ among other terms).
Spatiotemporal data can be analysed for building an interactive view of data points in similar and different regions, to
analyse data from localized areas or to map and compare spatial distribution in individual regions [59]. In previous pandemics, spatiotemporal analysis has been used to identify
cholera hotspots in Zambia [60]. With COVID-19 spreading
so fast, the scientific peer-review process is struggling to catch
up. Currently, there is only one scientific publication on the
Web of Science Core Collection under the search on ‘COVID19 and spatiotemporal data’. On the other hand, there are only
24 records on the Web of Science Core Collection under the
search on ‘pandemic and spatiotemporal data’, which means
that scientific research is lacking on this topic.

Since our search of established peer-reviewed scientific
research on the Web of Science Core Collection resulted with
too few records to conduct statistical analysis, in the next
section, we instead applied a quantitative case study research
methodology. In the case study research, we used other search
engines, such as Google Scholar. However, the consistently
low records on the Web of Science Core Collection present an
overwhelmingly strong argument that highly ranked scientific
research, in a sufficient quantity for statistical review and
analysis, is currently missing.

Summary of digital solutions for COVID-19
and future pandemic management
The current digital health infrastructure requires enhancements to support medical efforts in COVID-19 and future
pandemics management. Such enhancements are not only required in the field of artificial intelligence algorithms but also
in digital infrastructure for data collection in relation to current
and past location monitoring, disease transmission forecasting
and health monitoring. This is similar to enhancements of
infrastructure as response to other natural disasters (e.g.
floods, earthquakes). Fortunately, digital technologies have
advanced significantly since the last pandemic, presenting a
variety of digital solutions that could be adopted for pandemic
management relatively easy.
The COVID-19 crisis also changed the perception of medical data sharing, leading to wide acceptance of new mobile
apps designed for various pandemic management functions,
all based on some form of sharing personal data. Just a few
months ago, it would have been unprecedented to even think
about one million downloads for a mobile app that requires
sharing your personal medical data, including current and past
location history. There seems to be a consensus among governments about the benefits of such mobile apps. There are,
however, some measures that are operational in individual
regions, but have not even been considered in others. In
Fig. 7, these tools and measures are integrated, to design a
more comprehensive data collection and migration, for epidemic monitoring of regional risk trends and indices of highrisk people or areas. We designed this diagram with data from
this study, using the ‘draw.io’ open access web software.19
In the past decade, there was a fast innovation of new
digital technologies. This resulted in the new concept of digital health, on which some of the solutions in Fig. 7 are based.
Although these digital solutions are already operational and
can easily be adopted for pandemic management, without
proper planning significant challenges could emerge. Some
challenges could relate to capturing duplicate data, hence
adding significant workload on medical workers that collect,

manage and use the data. The design of these digital health
solutions separately could lead to lack of interoperability
when their integration is crucial for making evidence-based
decisions. Individual design could also lead to complexity, for
example, hindering the ability of medical professionals to use
digital health systems. Open standards for data structure and
interoperability in this discipline would help.
While pandemics require a global response, not all countries have the capacity to govern the epidemic response in line
with privacy preserving policies. Technologically advanced
nations have the advantage in this field and could be faster
to use this leverage to advance the global digital health management. Technologically advanced nations could expand
these interoperable data systems and tools, strengthening data
governance and building capacity to collect and interpret data.
However, digitalisation on its own does not improve the
health outcome. A coordinated effort is needed that includes
both public and private sectors. Past cases have proven that
Zika and dengue outbreaks can be predicted within 400 m,
months in advance and with 88.7% accuracy, while in
Vietnam, an electronic surveillance platform is operative for
44 communicable diseases and syndromes in 63 provinces
and 711 districts.20 These examples confirm that interoperable
digital health systems lead to faster detection and response and

20

https://www.csis.org/analysis/can-digital-health-help-stop-next-epidemic

increased preparedness. We review in more detail these interoperable digital health systems as shown in Fig. 7.

Case study on social networks operating as social
machines in digital healthcare
Social networks with large numbers of participants can provide answers to complex problems [6]. The virtualisation of
IoT devices into virtual objects for remote access and control
creates a dynamic virtual network connecting different domains, facilitating sharing of resources in a cloud environment
[18]. This creates opportunities for fast and diverse application
development through a dynamic end-to-end connection between devices that include those following.

Social media citizen’s advice
A social media citizen’s advice type system could be designed
to connect people with skills and expertise to those who need
free access to the advice. This could include legal advice,
health, well-being and nutritional advice, technical home
computing advice, DIY and small-scale problem-solving engineering advice. This could link to a new app in a format
allowing talking about points of concern and should include
an option for sharing symptoms and predicted evolution.

324

Identify fake data
Social media should start classifying and flagging misinformation relating to virus spread; and healthcare systems that
monitor these social networks or that directly collect reports
from patients should include automated analysis to identify
postings concerning symptoms. Fake data in digital systems
based on human input is a well-studied subject [61], and digital health systems should be based on existing
recommendations.
Seamless global sharing and processing of geographical data
that preserves privacy
The complex and diverse set of data sharing restrictions imposed by countries, regions and companies, sometimes embodied as laws, standards or policies, need to evolve into
internationally supported and consistently standardized protocols for the seamless sharing of data, especially where data is
kept private for geo-political or commercial reasons [44].
Such data sharing would enable the development of a large
database that might be enhanced with artificial intelligence
tools for processing data for early detection and better virus
containment.
Definitions of trust in data collection and analysis
during pandemics
In some countries, such as the EU and the USA, people have
low level of trust in their governments [1]. Hence, gaining
trust in digital systems for data collection and analysis during
pandemics is important. Trust is described differently in social
networks; for example, Amazon and eBay use star ratings,
while P2P networks measure quality of downloaded files
and speed. There are various schemes of trust, with diverse
trust scaling, dimensions, inferences and semantic meanings
[26].
Population location activity surveillance
A mobile phone app can be used to track down the people who
have been in close contact with those diagnosed with COVID19. An app could use contact information (such as calendar
entries/social nets) to track potential infections. In addition,
cloud, IoT and social media can be used in combination with
a new app, for general population location activity surveillance of quarantined people (by locality) and to design worldwide interactive maps. The cloud enables a vision for worldwide IoT integration [31]. Anonymised IoT medical data sharing though the cloud enables the development of interactive
maps of COVID-19 cases worldwide. The cloud and IoT technologies can be used for image or video tracking of
(super)spreaders or those regularly flouting social distancing

EPMA Journal (2020) 11:311–332

advice. The phone app could enable linking to volunteering
groups that allows (verified/tested) people who have got
through COVID-19 to be part of an immune volunteer resource pool. In the development of pandemic management
interactive maps, the definitions of trust, privacy and security
in digital systems for data collection and analysis during pandemics need to be based on globally accepted online
standards.
Local interactive maps
A localized COVID-19 mapping system can help residents
monitor total cases in their areas, which will enhance value
of data sharing and strengthen uptake of government
measures.
COVID-19 pandemic observatory
A pandemic observatory can be used for COVID-19 and for
fast response in future pandemics. The observatory would be a
cloud-based platform designed to ingest, store, share, analyse
and visualize COVID-19-related datasets, e.g. to support and
integrate data collected through an app that people voluntarily
install to allow access and tracking of (a) health and wellbeing
details; (b) access to location data; and (c) to insert infection
data for mapping behaviour with timeline and geography of
the virus (findings might be incubation time; mapping of first
symptoms; length of feeling sick; and response to identification of sickness).

Case study on connected devices operating as social
machines in digital healthcare
Anonymised real-time data from wearable devices
for spatiotemporal mapping and healthcare
Wearable devices and other types of healthy sensors measuring heartbeat, blood pressure and body temperature are abundantly present in many urban areas. Future design of such
wearables (e.g. Fitbits, Apple Watches) can be adapted to
enable body temperature and other symptoms that would enhance early self-diagnosis of viral infections. Allowing
anonymised data to be collected, analysed and shared in real
time via the cloud can be used for building spatiotemporal
mapping and for enhancing the idea of ‘connected healthcare’,
without breaching data privacy and security [44], by following
existing advise on end-user control [62] and automation control systems [63]. Future wearables should be encouraged to
include skin sensors for temperature monitoring, which would
be linked to geo-mapping and local medical or volunteering
teams to ensure people are safe and secure. Wearable devices
should include automated hand washing assessment on washing hands properly. Wearable sensors can be used to quantify

EPMA Journal (2020) 11:311–332

lung volume and functions, or point of care systems could
provide care at home and alleviate the pressure on NHS.
Respiratory parameters can be estimated using wearable sensors, spirometers, activity sensors and SPO2 sensors to
provide early detection and improved prognosis in patients.
The goal should be to create value [64], and it is the design
that drives value from connected devices [65].

Agritech during pandemics
Agritech is the use of technology in agriculture, horticulture
and aquaculture for improving yield, efficiency and profitability.21 During global pandemics, agricultural harvest faces a
significant drop in workers.22 Agritech can reduce inputs
and increase yields, but adoption is costly, complex and slow.
COVID-19 is an opportunity for governments to support big
and small agritech companies and new pioneering start-ups23
to help rapidly accelerate it, not only to help the agriculture
industry to survive COVID-19 but also to prepare the industry
and develop the technology in anticipations of future global
pandemics.

Smart meter analysis
Geographical analysis of electricity, water and gas consumption may be used to evaluate adherence to social distancing;
with mobile alerts or warnings sent to non-adhering areas.
Privacy-preserving measures could include focus on adherence over a large geographical area and not on individual
households. Similar analysis is already published on the domestic energy usage patterns during social distancing.24

Mobile telemetry for lockdown monitoring
Mobile phone networks hold personal mobile phone telemetry
that can be used as a real-time data source for feeding AI
techniques to identify and send message alerts to those likely
to be ignoring the lockdown. Personal mobile phone telemetry
can also be used in an app to accompany contact tracing
though Bluetooth and Wi-Fi data in identifying those who
have come into contact with someone who has COVID-19.
In addition, some smart home systems can help with pandemic management. Existing supervised intrusion detection systems [66] could be adopted to detect home visitors that should
be in self-isolation.

mHealth and virtual clinics as mobile applications
Mobile health (mHealth)25 is not a new concept. It involves
using mobile devices, usually through a secure mobile app,
for healthcare management, data sharing and improving patient
experience. Apart from mHealth, there are also virtual clinics
that can provide personalized medical advice and encourage
participatory surveillance for geo-located predictions.
Currently operational virtual clinics include PingAn in
China.26 They are effective at reducing costs and saving time
and may provide access to medicines through machine dispensers. In developing countries, the cost and time required to
build, equip and distribute new machine dispensers may be
prohibitive. Adapting the already built and distributed existing
food and drink dispensing machines could be faster and more
effective. A simple restocking with non-prescription over-thecounter medicines while changing the prices would provide a
fast and cost-effective solution. Virtual clinic pharmacy testing
kit outcomes should be linked to a central database and any
pandemic monitoring system. Virtual clinics should also enable
video and supervised tutorials for the self-management (at
home) of oxygen therapy, including protocol, sensor use
(SPO2) and O2 generation/administration.
To be effective in pandemics when most of the population
is in self-isolation, virtual clinics should evolve into mobile
applications enabling home access. Similarly to the South
Korean ‘self-quarantine safety protection’ app that traces
GPS location to track if people are avoiding quarantine and
enables self-quarantined people to communicate with medical
caseworkers,27 teleconferencing, or video conferencing, has
long been used in telehealth,28 also known as telemedicine.
It involves a real-time video call, while exchanging other medical data (e.g. blood pressure) required for a medical check.
Collaboration apps for virtual meetings are also well
established in the medical profession. Collaboration apps enable remote data collection from patients and analysis by medical practitioners based in different geographical locations.
Global pandemics have exposed a weakness in the personal
protective equipment (PPE) manufacturing and supply chains.
Some hospitals have resorted to the use of substandard PPE
because they had nothing else to use. Individual GPs have
reported using the black market to obtain PPE at a much
higher cost.29 Urgent PPE deliveries have also been found of
substandard quality and had to be taken out of use.30 Advice

has also been given to medical staff to refuse treating patients
if they do not have adequate PPE.31,32 Given these widespread
concerns about the ability to manufacture and supply sufficient PPE in the face of sudden demand, we should be looking
at how robotic technologies could be used to improve the
safety of medical professionals during a second wave or in
future pandemics. There are three types of healthcare robotics:
medical, assistive and rehabilitative. When AI enhanced, robots could attend to multiple patients in quarantined areas, for
example, by delivering drugs. Robots could also be enhanced
with interactive chatbot, similar to the WHO WhatsApp auto
responder, which has the potential to reach 2 billion people.

Blockchain technology in digital health systems
Blockchain technology could enhance the security and privacy of digital health systems while resolving specific problems
in pandemic management (e.g. blockchain in virtual pharmacies for panic buying prevention). Dispensing nonprescription medicines (e.g. paracetamol, cough syrup), medical items (e.g. face masks) or household essentials (e.g. disinfectants) through low-tech dispensing machines is a quick
and low-cost solution for 24-h available distribution with minimal human interaction. But as we have seen during the initial
stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, people behave irrationally
during crises and panic buying could lead to just a few people
emptying the dispensing machines. In many countries, shops
place restrictions on essential items, to preserve stocks from
panic buying. Given that virtual pharmacies are a low cost,
low human interaction solution, such restrictions need to be
implemented through a technology that enables purchase control and monitoring. Panic during the COVID-19 pandemic
was only a temporary issue. Therefore, for resolving shortterm issues, purchase control mechanisms should either be
low cost or enhance other functions of the systems (e.g. security and privacy).
Blockchain technology33 has been in existence for some
time. Open and public blockchain provides security without
access control, serving as the transport layer for applications to
be added to a network without the separate approval of trust.
Design principles have already been proposed for ‘tamperresistant gathering, processing, and exchange of IoT sensor
data’ [67] privacy-preserving blockchain-based sensor data
protection systems (SDPS). One of the use cases for evaluating the SDPS is IoT in a pharmaceutical supply chain.
We demonstrate in Fig. 8 how blockchain could operate in
digital health systems.

EPMA Journal (2020) 11:311–332

We designed the diagram in Fig. 8 with data from this
study, using the ‘draw.io’ open access web software. 34
There are permissionless (e.g. bitcoin) and permissioned
blockchains (e.g. Facebook libra). The main difference for
digital health systems is that permissioned blockchains are
vetted by the network owner, whereas permissionless
blockchains depend on anonymous nodes to validate transactions. In digital health systems, permissionless blockchains
have advantages in preventing powerful actors in making decisions that favour individual groups at the expense of others.
Permissioned blockchains on the other hand are regulated
by the authority of a specific ecosystem, usually a consortium,
and present opportunities for creating interconnected systems.
Such interconnected system could be designed by a consortium of healthcare providers, with patients’ data belonging to
the blockchain, and patients identified through unique ID providing both security and privacy of the patient. A patients’
information sharing marketplace could prevent information
blocking, and if cyber-attack results in information blocking,
permissioned blockchains would present two unique advantages. Firstly, anyone in the medical consortium could check
how and when information and transactions are happening.
Secondly, blocking the information would change the hash
on which the unique ID is based. Considering the above, the
advantages for digital health systems are that patients can
transmit personal records without the risk of tampering because blockchains are immutable and traceable. Apart from
patients’ security with blockchain permissions required for
patient’s medical data sharing, there are advantages in
preventing fake or illegal sale of medication and with
checking points of origin.

Artificial intelligence for automatic diagnosis
Artificial intelligence systems are already in use for automatic
diagnosis for conditions unrelated to COVID-19 (e.g.
Zhongshan Ophthalmic Eye Center, China), and abnormal
respiratory pattern classifiers are already in development for
large-scale screening of people infected with COVID-19 [68].
As previously discussed, IoT connected thermal cameras
could feed data into artificial intelligence systems for temperature screening in busy transport areas such as airports or train
stations [45]. Such real-time data streams can support and
enhance pandemic-risk management, but only if open protocols are set for safe and seamless communication between
devices [44]. Unnecessary fragmentation of data restricts
knowledge on trends and decisions on containment [44].

Intelligent diagnosis, monitoring and supervision
Intelligent-assisted diagnosis, monitoring and supervision can
be conducted relatively simply, and lessons can be learned
from existing live tracking systems.35 Online questionnaires
can be uploaded into a real-time cloud database, and models
can be updated based on the latest real case medical data to
increase accuracy with results integrated in mobile applications automatically. Diagnoses can be grouped and automatically placed into ‘confirmed, suspected or suspicious’, while
simultaneously, patients can be classified into ‘mild, moderate, severe or critical pneumonia’ categories [9]. The automatic patient classification may provide questionnaire on severity
of infection, while the patient diagnosis grouping provides
reassurances on the likelihood of infection. Such reassurances
are aimed at reducing the pressure on medical professionals by
limiting the need for in-person interaction.
Tracking cases of prolonged isolation
Existing systems (e.g. Gov.uk/NHS vulnerability register36)
can be used to create a mechanism for supermarkets to distinguish between customers in prolonged or age-related isolation
and customers who are essential workers and those who are
not a priority for home delivery services. Since this (online
self-registration) mechanism already exists, preservation of
privacy can be based on the existing system. This could be
connected with a community-managed app linking volunteers 37 to those who are self-isolating and need help
shopping, for example.
Tracking high-risk cases
Detection and mapping of high-risk groups that are not currently being treated by the UK’s NHS could help identify the
most in need of immediate support due to isolation measures.
In addition to tracking, digital health apps need to focus on
predicting high-risk cases. Predicting vulnerability and criticality in patients can be achieved using ML models perhaps
with input from activity sensors.
Mental health impact mitigation
The COVID-19 pandemic could trigger new and sometimes
unexpected mental health problems. Some mitigation activities could include free meals or relief on financial challenges
or free showers to promote outdoor sports during work breaks.
Information stations, like reception desks, could promote expression of concerns and keep workspaces safe while

327

addressing staff concerns and anxieties. Social distancing will
create a significant impact on mental health, and mental
healthcare support needs to adapt to addressing not only the
feelings of financial loss but also the feeling of emotional loss,
the loss of self-worth, loss of motivation and a loss of meaning
in daily life.38

Discussion on gaps in scientific research
Our search of historic and recent scientific records on pandemics and new forms of data, on the Web of Science Core
Collection, resulted in very limited records. In some cases, we
found only a single record. It is unclear if this result is caused
by lack of funding or lack of interest in the past on this research topic. Although we used all data records from the Web
of Science Core Collection, there could be gaps in the data we
are using. It could be too soon for publications with COVID19 to have been published―and we should compare how
different will it be in a year’s time. We plan to rerun these
queries again to see how the results have changes. In future
studies, we should be focused on publication times, and if a
vaccine is identified in the next few months or years, we
should investigate how many papers have been published,
comparable with the increase in COVID-19 activity. Future
studies should also look at other factors of the virus in
literature.
In any case, we can only discuss the gaps and results from
the data records we currently have. Here is a brief outline of
the gaps in scientific research.
Currently, there are only five scientific publications on the
Web of Science Core Collection under the search on ‘COVID19 and big data’, and only 59 on ‘pandemics and big data’,
using historical records since 1900 (to 2020). Search results
on ‘big data’ alone produced 88,410 records. There are 0
results on ‘COVID-19 and time-stamped data’ and on
‘COVID-19 and genomics data’. The search of historic records, from 1900 to 2020, on ‘pandemic and time-stamped
data’ resulted in only 3 records and on ‘pandemic and genomics data’ in 43 records. The search on ‘COVID-19 and highdimensional data’ resulted in 0 records, and the search of
historic records on ‘pandemic and high-dimensional data’ resulted in only 2 records.
Spatiotemporal data: currently, there is only one scientific
publication on the Web of Science Core Collection under the
search on ‘COVID-19 and spatiotemporal data’ and only 24
historic records since 1900 (to 2020) under the search on
‘pandemic and spatiotemporal data’. Scientific research is
needed on using spatiotemporal data in pandemic
management.

Discussion on research objectives
and research findings from the review
Following the example of previous studies [69, 70] related to
predictive, preventive and personalized conclusions and expert recommendations, in this section, we review our research
objectives and present our conclusions and expert
recommendations.
The first objective of the paper was to review, compare and
critically assess predictive, preventive and personalized digital
technology responses to the COVID-19 pandemic around the
world, with the aim of identifying a digital approach to
COVID-19 and future global pandemics. Despite applying
statistical software to analyse all of the existing literature on
the Web of Science and other databases, the conclusion of the
study is that we are currently not in a position to critically
assess this technology and the best approach varies by country
as it will be a function of wealth, smart phone usage and
culture. Our recommendation on culture is that when choosing
solutions, we must consider that in some societies like the
USA, people tend to make decisions based on the individual
(‘shelter in place’), while others like China or Taiwan are
more about the whole (‘social isolation’), with Europe in the
middle. Mirroring this, there are differing attitudes towards
ceding privacy to the state or networks of corporations mentioned in the results.
The second objective and a point of interest in this paper
was to review predictive, preventive and personalized

interoperable digital healthcare solutions. The aim of this objective was to promote research that prevents failures from the
past, where the separate design of digital health solutions has
led to lack of interoperability. Hence, the review includes case
studies that investigate different interoperable digital
healthcare systems. A diverse set of non-contact digital
healthcare technologies are investigated in case studies from
different regions in the world. In our conclusion, we found no
increase in personal data security risks from the integration of
these digital technologies. What we did find was that some
technologies have been used effectively in healthcare for decades (e.g. teleconferencing, mobile health, collaboration
apps, virtual meetings, robotics, artificial intelligence), but
we still failed in preventing the COVID-19 pandemic from
spreading globally at a very fast rate.
Among many questions emerging from this review, in our
recommendation, the following are considered to be
important:
(1) How will we approach the problem of global healthcare
strategies for predictive, preventive and personalized
pandemic management?
(2) How will we deal with the lack of adoption of the
reviewed non-contact technologies?
(3) How will we address the lack of digital investment and
technological adaptation in predictive, preventive and
personalized healthcare systems?
(4) How will we handle the resistance to change?

EPMA Journal (2020) 11:311–332

(5) How do we stop the problem of fake news about
COVID-19 (and future pandemics) and cyber risks in
personal data sharing with these established and regulated systems.
Apart from the multiple benefits identified for future global
pandemic management, the review does not identify any new
or unaccounted cyber risks from developing these interoperable digital healthcare solutions.
The third objective of the paper was to determine if the
proposed new predictive, preventive and personalized technologies and data policies for mass surveillance linking personal data from health professionals to governments would
actually address the pandemic crisis. The finding from the
review paper is that public response is limited by a mistrust
about data privacy and that this differs across countries, depending on the chosen public communication strategy.
Most countries’ digital responses involve combinations of
big data analytics, integration of national health insurance databases, tracing travel history from individual’s location databases, code scanning and individual’s online reporting. What
is missing in the COVID-19 pandemic around the world is an
integrated approach for digital healthcare management. In the
review paper, we identified a plethora of tried and tested noncontact predictive, preventive and personalized digital
healthcare concepts (e.g. mHealth, virtual clinics) that could
help with controlling and preventing future pandemics. Mass
surveillance linking personal data from health professionals
should not be collected and used by governments but to the
non-contact digital health technologies. The surveillance approach promoted by tech companies, where data is processed
on individual devices and only anonymised data is shared with
approval of the device owner, seems safer than some proposals for creating national databases. The concerns that big
tech companies would abuse our personal data are in some
cases exaggerated. Such personal data is already stored in our
mobile devices and shared on social media sites, in mobile
health apps, wearable devices or with our GP surgeries, in
compliance with current data privacy regulations. Hence,
focus should be placed on secure integration of this data,
which is already shared, for the purposes of COVID-19 and
future pandemics detection, monitoring and management.
Such integration would create numerous benefits for the
healthcare system, and we should anticipate an increased usage of these existing methods for sharing personal data.
Many new users would be unfamiliar with how mobile
data is analysed on our secured individual devices and how
anonymised data is shared. This would firstly trigger fear of
personal data abuse; secondly it would expose users unfamiliar with data privacy to agreeing for their data being shared
without understanding the data privacy policies. Hence, in
times when mass personal data surveillance is necessary, a
mass information campaign should also be focused on

329

individual understanding of these new surveillance systems.
This could be an opportunity for governments to enable tech
companies to learn from the COVID-19 and develop predictive, preventive and personalized tools that could prevent or
minimize the effect of future pandemics. We should avoid
mistakes from the past, when we did not prepare and learn
lessons from previous pandemics, that are reviewed in this
paper.

Conclusion
The most visible narrative from this review paper is that global
pandemics require global response, and the world has failed to
learn from previous pandemics. While big tech companies
(Google and Apple) are promoting a unified global approach,
some governments are promoting regional approaches. While
regional approaches can work in localized geographical areas,
the abilities of developing countries to adopt similar regional
systems are questionable. Most of the required predictive, preventive and personalized technologies (e.g. mobile phones,
mobile apps, low-cost connected devices (IoT) and Internet
connection) are present in developing counties. But the abilities of some developing countries to develop regional predictive, preventive and personalized pandemic monitoring systems are questionable. Especially when considering the required speed for building such systems and the need to operate
at low latency, this leads to the inevitable conclusion that such
systems should be global and in place ready to be activated in
cases of pandemics. Adding to this, the review study concludes that such global systems for pandemic management
should also be designed as interoperable and coupled with
existing digital non-contact healthcare systems.
To contribute to the design of such predictive, preventive
and personalized interoperable and coupled digital noncontact healthcare systems, this review paper presents a survey of the Internet of Things and social machine literature as
well as the overlap with the COVID-19 pandemic management. It continues with a survey of technology-driven mitigative measures and suggests some possible applications of technology in the COVID-19 pandemic management.
The review applied statistical software to review and analyse existing databases and concluded that we still lack the
data to critically access what the best approach is to integrate
digital technologies in healthcare and pandemic management.
The best approach probably varies by country as it will be a
function of wealth, smart phone usage and culture.
The review was enhanced with case studies on predictive,
preventive and personalized interoperability of digital
healthcare solutions and found that some technologies have
been used effectively in healthcare for decades, and the risk of
personal data exposure was not enhanced by these technologies. But these technologies failed in preventing the COVID-

330

19 pandemic from spreading globally at a very fast rate. These
technologies have the potential to prevent rapid spread of pandemics and even contain pandemics. Hence, future efforts
should be placed on predictive, preventive and personalized
pandemic management strategies and pandemic preparedness.
The world has contained pandemics in the past. Many regions
have failed to use the technologies described in this report, or
in many cases even to learn from past successes, and have
failed to manage this pandemic. This could change, and since
the data is currently incomplete, we will run this analysis again
in a year and see how it has changed and how it compares with
previous pandemics. This study represents a snapshot in time
and can be used in future studies for investigating different
stages of the pandemic.
Finally, emerging mass population surveillance systems
should be built in a predictive, preventive and personalized
interoperable system, to promote advancement of non-contact
digital healthcare concepts (e.g. mHealth), that could help
controlling and preventing future pandemics. To promote
such an interoperable approach, the new mass population surveillance system cannot rely solely on technology and need to
operate as social machines. Social machines with large numbers of human-computer participants can provide predictive,
preventive and personalized answers to different and complex
pandemic monitoring problems.
