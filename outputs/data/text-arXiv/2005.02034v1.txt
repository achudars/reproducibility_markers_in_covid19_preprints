Abstract—Assessing the trend of the COVID-19 pandemic
and policy effectiveness is essential for both policymakers and
stock investors, but challenging because the crisis has unfolded
with extreme speed and the previous index was not suitable
for measuring policy effectiveness for COVID-19. This paper
builds an index of policy effectiveness on fighting COVID-19
pandemic, whose building method is similar to the index of Policy
Uncertainty, based on province-level paper documents released
in China from Jan.1st to Apr.16th of 2020. This paper also
studies the relationships among COVID-19 daily confirmed cases,
stock market volatility, and document-based policy effectiveness
in China. This paper uses the DCC-GARCH model to fit
conditional covariance’s change rule of multi-series. This paper
finally tests four hypotheses, about the time-space difference of
policy effectiveness and its overflow effect both on the COVID19 pandemic and stock market. Through the inner interaction
of this triad structure, we can bring forward more specific and
scientific suggestions to maintain stability in the stock market at
such exceptional times.
Index Terms—Covid, Policy, Index, Stock market, DCCGARCH

I. I NTRODUCTION
In early 2020, a pandemic called COVID-19 swept through
China. In January-February, China’s economy came to a standstill, and while maintaining social order and stable supplies,
people stayed at home and made fighting the pandemic their
first political task. Unfortunately, it become a global event[12].
At such exceptional times, the pandemic, the capital market,
and government paper document, the triad interact to form
unique institutional features.
The spread of the pandemic has prompted the government
to take administrative and summoning measures to control the
pandemic and to prevent its further deterioration. Likewise,
once the government had published a piece of the paper
document, the country deployed heavily from the top down
to achieve the most vigorous form of resistance. At the same
time, the pandemic had a huge impact on financial markets.
Due to the fear of the pandemic, people worried about the
synchronized slowdown of global economic growth[8], thus
the risk of the Chinese New Year market suspension accumulated. Even pessimism and irrational behavior superimposed,
finally, resulting in greater volatility in the Chinese stocks.[10]
Compared to the volatile impact of the pandemic on the capital
market, the effect of the government policy was more explicit

through social sentiment, while the effect to the capital market
was more directly on the two driving forces, production and
consumption, to stimulate the capital market.
Therefore, exploring the inner relationship among the pandemic, the stocks, and government documents can help to
understand the economic and social phenomena in special
times and can also study the effectiveness of Chinese government documents. To provide policy measures and development
recommendations for reference when the global pandemic
situation remains critical.
Indexes relevant to COVID-19 are most based on web-news
data[4] while the policy document text contains valuable information but rarely being extracted. the Policy Uncertainty Index
is measured by count specific terms relevant to uncertainty in
the newspaper. As for COVID-19, there is no efficient index
to measure corresponding policy effectiveness. Building Policy
Effectiveness for COVID-19 is urgently needed. Once built, it
could be used to analyze the triad relationship with the stock
market and COVID-19 infection.
II. H YPOTHESIS
Based on the principles of economics and political science,
We put forward four hypotheses. The assumption of the effect
of paper documents is based on China’s modern administrative mechanism, government role, and government credibility,
while the assumption of financial market fluctuations is based
on the reality of China’s financial market and the characteristics of the socialist market economy.
A. Hypothesis 1: There is a lag of the corresponding policy
promulgated between the local and the central.
Policy Publishing in China is characterized by an ”Sshaped” curve over time, in which the introduction of the
same thematic policies by central and local governments
goes through periods of slow, rapid, and steady proliferation.
Spatially, it presents a variety of geographic diffusion effects
such as proximity effect, hierarchical effect, axial effect, and
agglomeration effect. However, considering the main body of
action and the political proliferation, the speed of response
to the publication of central government documents varies
somewhat across China.[15]

B. Hypothesis 2:There are regional differences in the management and response to the pandemic.
China is a vast country, and factors such as geography,
population, and transportation have led to different levels of
pandemic severity throughout the country.[14] Wuhan, Hubei
Province, is the earliest region in China where the pandemic
was detected and the most strictly controlled. As for the
southern and eastern parts of the country are the closest to
Hubei compared to the far western and northeastern parts.
The epidemic control is more stringent, comparing with other
places.[6]
C. Hypothesis 3:Fluctuations in the level of the pandemic
affect the publication of government documents, while the
power of the documents influences the next stage of the
pandemic
Whether the control of pandemic can be scientific, timely,
and effective largely depends on the degree of specialization
and decision-making capacity of the health sectors. [9]The
relevance and forcefulness of the communication directly
influence the next step of the pandemic.[7]
D. Hypothesis 4:The publication of the paper documents
stimulates the stock market.
The pandemic affected the country’s economy on a large
scale. It in turn sent shockwaves through stocks. In order
to maintain financial stability and the normal operation of
the capital market, the adoption of economic policies will
stimulate liquidity in the financial market and reduce systemic
risks.[13]

IV. M ETHOD
In this section, We will first show you how to build the index
of Policy Effectiveness on COVID-19, which can be promoted
to a more general situation. Also, the series analysis method
we use will be demonstrated a lot.
A. Index building method
Our goal here is to assess policy reflected to COVID-19
pandemic. A necessary first step is to quantify the effect
and intensity of specific paper documents, which obviously
give a response to current COVID-19 events, in a manner
that delivers a suitable input into a statistical model. The
Economic Policy Uncertainty Indices of Baker, Bloom, and
Davis[1] reflects the frequency of newspaper articles with one
or more terms about economics, policy and uncertainty in
roughly 2,000 U.S. newspapers. Their work inspired us to
find keywords relevant to COVID-19 in paper document. We
calculate the frequency of each word and build an LDA topic
model to help us create a dictionary of those keywords.
1) frequency analysis:
To get a Chinese word list, since the Chinese don’t have
blank between words, we use Jieba package2 to cut each
document. Afterword segmentation, the easiest way to describe
the mathematical feature of text data is to count the words.
We choose word cloudIV-A1 to visualize one of our results
for Hubei province, where the outbreak happened. Frequent
and relevant words will be chosen for our dictionary. Since
different aspects of document will have different effect levels,
variety and balance should be considered. That’s why we built
the LDA model to extract topics information in the following.

III. DATA
As for this paper, we mainly use three types of time series
data, two of which are easy to obtain, as listed in the following.
•

•

•

Stock Volatility: We choose the SSE 50 index, compiled
by the Shanghai Stock Exchange, daily price change to
represent the stock market volatility in China.
COVID-19 Severity: The data we use is from the
National Health Commission of China. Since suspected
cases may highly correlate with confirmed cases, We only
apply daily confirmed cases.
Policy Effectiveness: We crawled all paper document
data from the province-level general office website in
China. The data contains fields like release date, file
number, title, and main text, where the earliest document
is published in 1983. To meet our need of giving the
focus on COVID-19, we finally use data in 2020(19252
observations). We use the LDA topic model to extract
text data and build a dictionary about COVID-19 related
policy, which will be demonstrated in the next section.
Our paper document data and crawling code are available
in GitHub1 .

2) LDA topic model:
In machine learning and natural language processing, a
topic model[2] is a type of statistical model for discovering
the abstract ”topics” that occur in a collection of documents.
Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for the
discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body.
We use the LDA model of Gensim to train my topic model.
the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical
model that allows sets of observations to be explained by
unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data
are similar. Finally we get five aspects for building our index,
shown in the following table.

3) Index building:
For each of the above five aspects, we choose high frequency and relevant word to build our dictionary of policy
keywords for COVID-19 pandemic, which now contains 99
words. With the new-built dictionary, we can count these
words appearing in each province website documents for each
day.
Now we get our raw data, we will show how to calculate
the Policy Effectiveness Index in this paper. Considering a
series of effective policy, among relevant paper documents
keywords will change with COVID-19 pandemic development.
We suppose that some constant keywords appearing nearly
in much more paper has less impact than the keywords only
found in the document for a specific problem in the time of
COVID-19.
Based on the above assumptions, we use the entropy weight
method[11] to weight the effectiveness of keywords in the
dictionary built for COVID-19. With the following formula,
we calculate the differentiation coefficient for each keyword.
We finally build a series of daily policy effectiveness for each
province.

B. Series Analysis method
We use multiple series module to fit relevant time series in the field of policy, stock, and COVID-19. We use
a common description method to show the series features,
such as line chart, autocorrelation coefficient, and white noise
test. Furthermore, we focus on the relation of the volatility

of different series, we choose the DCC-GARCH(Dynamic
Conditional Correlation - General Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroskedasticity) model to fit the change rule of conditional
covariance. The key formula of DCC is shown here, and we
refer you to this paper of Engle[5] for more details.

Qt = (1 − α − β)Q̄ + αut−1 ut−1 + βQt−1

(4)

For hypothesis 1, we use k-lag co-correlation between
Central and each province to see whether there is a significant
lag. As to hypothesis 2, we use 33 series of Policy Effective
Index to fit DCC-GARCH and GO-GARCH model to show
the variance series of six groups, which can be calculated by
summing up all the elements of covariance matrix within a
group. For hypothesis 3, we do a significance test on α and β
in the above fitted DCC-GARCH model. For hypothesis. For
hypothesis 4, we fit a new DCC-GARCH model using Central
Policy Index, COVID-19 confirmed cases, and SSE 50 Index,
and then we plot the series of the fitted covariance matrix to
analyze the relation of policy, COVID-19 and stock market.
V. R ESULT
The property of the policy effectiveness index series will
be shown first compared with the stock series and COVID-19
series. After testing their stationarity, We will use the DCC-

GARCH model to fit them and draw some conclusions relevant
to our hypothesis.
A. Policy Effectiveness Index’s property
In Figure 2V-A, Policy Effectiveness Index appears to follow specific periodic change rule, while SSE 50 and COVID19 series have an explosive jump in February. This time
coincides with the Chines New year. During this period, the
stock market closed, leading to virtually zero volatility. At
the same time, the outbreak of pandemic in China reached
its peak in Februaryespecially, on February 13, the number of
confirmed cases increases by more than 10,000 a day, which
meets the cutting edge of the volatility curve. That is why we
choose the heteroscedasticity model to fit them.

society, and the central policy also takes time to be implemented by the local government. We draw 34 co-correlation
graphs like V-B1Figure 3 and find three featuresIV appearing
in most graphs. Documents published by the center need to be
disseminated to local governments, which implement central
advice and orders according to local conditions. This process
takes some time. Due to the vast expanse of China and the
wide variation in circumstances, there are differences in the
time lag of paper documents. As seen in the Table 4IV, when
volatility lag is present, it is divided into strong and weak time
lag. This meets the ”S-shaped” curve theory, and the special
features bring a difference to the final time lags.

Fig. 2. Line charts of Central Policy Effectiveness Index, COVID-19 daily

We apply the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test to check their
unit root. The results in table 3III all support stationarity
hypothesis, which will avoid false regression in the model
fitting part.

B. Empirical analysis with DCC-GARCH
In this part, we fit the DCC-GARCH model with multiple
series of data and find some evidence supporting our four
hypotheses.
1) Test of Hypothesis 1:
ρ(y, x, lag = k) =

E[(yt − Eyt )(xt−k − Ext−k )]
p
V ar(yt )V ar(xt−k )

In the example of Hainan, we find explicit features like
Right Volatility Bias, Short-time Negative Correlation, Longtime Positive Correlation. Hainan Province is located at the
southern tip of China. When the pandemic first broke out in
Hubei, the central government published an official document
in response, and the Hainan provincial government remained
in a wait-and-see state during the first 7 days. However, as
the pandemic intensified, public policy was transmitted from
central to local, so seven days later, the government published
a similar policy in response to the central order. Thus, the
curve of Hainan Province clearly shows the time lag of paper
documents between the central and local.

(5)

Co-correlation coefficient is calculated by the above formula. Larger the value it is, the correlation between two
series with a k-lag is more significant. Almost every policy
information takes time to be reflected in the economy and

When the k-lag co-correlation graph of
a specific province has more significant
volatility in the right part, there may a rule
that the volatility of the specific province
follows Central’s with a lag.
When lag ≤ 7, the co-correlation coefficient
is negative. It may be the case that Central posed so many file while the specific
province keep still at the beginning of pandemic.

When k > 7, we can explain that it follow

2) Test of Hypothesis 2:
We use 33 Policy Effectiveness Index series to fit different multiple Garch models, including DCC(E), DCC(T),
GO-GARCH(MVN), GO-GARCH(maNIG). To show regional
difference clearer, We define six groups, based on spatial
position, and plot the volatility seriesV-B2 by summing up
corresponding elements in the predicted covariance matrix
of GARCH. Different regions in China seems to respond to
COVID-19 in absolutely different manners. As can be seen in
Figure 4V-B2, six figures represent the volatility of the Policy
Effectiveness Index of central, Hubei, North, South, East, and
west regions of China. The speed of publishing documents
and the administrative power will affect the volatility. Based
on this cause, Hubei as the first outbreak of the pandemic in
China, the volatility fluctuated most violently. For example,
in March, Hubei entered the most stringent control of the
pandemic period, and the government took maximum efforts
to combat the COVID-19. This moment relatively presented
as the peak on the curve. From a geographical perspective,
the south region is closest to Hubei, and with convenient
transportation bringing large population movements, the South
region has a faster and stronger rate of publication of paper
documents than other regions.

Fig. 4. Six group volatility series predicted by DCC-GARCH and GOGARCH

3) Test of Hypothesis 3:
Indeed reflexibility is a common phenomenon in macroeconomy. In this part, we want to figure out how COVID19, Policy Effectiveness, and Stock Emotion react to each
other, from the perspective of volatility, by DCC-GARCH.
First we apply a AR(1) on each series and then we fit a
simple DCC-GARCH which only takes 1-lag information into
consideration. The estimate and t-test of our model are shown
in Table 5V. Each series contributes to volatility prediction
and the joint part gives us a direct estimate of overflow
effects. From the significant coefficients, it can be seen that
the issuance of central documents is often not influenced by
historical documents, but rather tends to take into account
external factors such as the previous national situation and the
development of the pandemic, while the pandemic has evolved

as a cumulative result of historical circumstances in addition
to other external factors. As for the stocks, it’s condition and
features are similar to the epidemic. The historical external
factors of the triad are significant in the overflow effects of
the triad interaction.

4) Test of Hypothesis 4:
For a visual test of our hypothesis, We plot the variance and covariance of the above three series predicted by
DCC-GARCH. As seen in Figure 5V-B4, in February, the
average of central-COVID-covariance is negative, this suggests that, in February of the outbreak, the volatility of the
policy effectiveness index is more stable, which means the
control power with the pandemic is weak. Lack of timely
and effective communication policies directly affect the next
stage of the pandemicas we can see in Figure 2V-A, the
COVID-29 achieved to the peak. Lessons learned, as the
paperwork followed the development situation of epidemic,
volatility covariance reverted to nearly zero. This explains
the interaction between the epidemic and official effectiveness
visually. The overflow effects of paper documents and the
stock market are the opposite. Also in February, the centralstock-covariance is positive. This means that the stronger the
paper document, the more volatile the stock market, that is,
the paper document stimulates the stock market. This may
be due to the government’s publication of more economic
policies related to releasing liquidity in the financial markets
and supporting returning to work.
VI. C ONCLUSION
A system of policy effectiveness index made by keywords
was constructed to extract data on the national public documents from January to April. It quantifies the effectiveness
of the documents by the volatility of the indicators. After
analysis, we empirically concluded that the policy effectiveness of central government documents is highly significant,
although the time lag and power between central and local
varies. The government has published six major policies on
”stringent Control”, ”Transparent information”, ”construction

50 Index and COVID-19 daily confirmed cases

innovation”, ”Social Safety” and ”Economic Support” to control the pandemic and stabilize the economy. Just a piece of
paper document can give the stock market a shot in the arm
from the social emotions and economic base, while attracting
the source of living water to the capital market.
