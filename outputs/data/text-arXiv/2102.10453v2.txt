THE ASSOCIATION OF OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS WITH THE
SPREAD OF COVID-19 IN THE UNITED STATES: COUNTY-LEVEL
PANEL DATA ANALYSIS
VICTOR CHERNOZHUKOV, HIROYUKI KASAHARA, AND PAUL SCHRIMPF

Abstract. This paper empirically examines how the opening of K-12 schools and colleges
is associated with the spread of COVID-19 using county-level panel data in the United
States. Using data on foot traffic and K-12 school opening plans, we analyze how an
increase in visits to schools and opening schools with different teaching methods (in-person,
hybrid, and remote) is related to the 2-weeks forward growth rate of confirmed COVID19 cases. Our debiased panel data regression analysis with a set of county dummies,
interactions of state and week dummies, and other controls shows that an increase in visits
to both K-12 schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case growth
rates. The estimates indicate that fully opening K-12 schools with in-person learning is
associated with a 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase in the growth rate of cases. We
also find that the positive association of K-12 school visits or in-person school openings
with case growth is stronger for counties that do not require staff to wear masks at schools.
These results have a causal interpretation in a structural model with unobserved county
and time confounders. Sensitivity analysis shows that the baseline results are robust to
timing assumptions and alternative specifications.

1. Introduction
Does opening K-12 schools lead to the spread of COVID-19? Do mitigation strategies such as mask-wearing requirements help reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at
school? These are important policy relevant questions in countries with low vaccination
rates, especially given the emerging variants of concerns with higher transmission rates. If
in-person school openings substantially increase COVID-19 cases, then local governments
could promote enforcing mitigation measures at schools (universal and proper masking, social distancing, and handwashing) to lower the risk of COVID-19 spread. Furthermore, the
governments could prioritize vaccines for education workers and elderly parents in case of
in-person school openings. This paper uses county-level panel data on K-12 school opening
plans and mitigation strategies together with foot traffic data to investigate how an increase
in the visits to K-12 schools is associated with a subsequent increase in COVID-19 cases in
the United States.

Data
We begin with describing our data and provide descriptive evidence. Our sample period
is from April 1, 2020, to December 2, 2020. Our analysis uses county-level panel data in
the United States. As outcome variables, we use the weekly cases and deaths as well as
their growth rates. The main explanatory variables of interest are the variable for school
openings with different teaching methods and mitigation measures from MCH Strategic
Data and per-device visits to K-12 schools from SafeGraph foot traffic data. We also use
the foot traffic data on stay-at-home devices and visits to full-time/part-time workplaces,
colleges/universities, restaurants, bars, recreational facilities, and churches. Our panel regression analysis uses the additional data on non-pharmaceutical policy interventions (NPIs)
and the number of tests.
The data on cases and deaths for each county are from the New York Times. SafeGraph provides foot traffic data based on a panel of GPS pings from anonymous mobile
devices. Per-device visits to K-12 schools, colleges/universities, restaurants, bars, recreational places, and churches are constructed from the ratio of daily device visits to these
point-of-interest locations to the number of devices residing in each county. Full-time and
part-time workplace visits are the ratio of the number of devices that spent more than 6
hours and between 3 to 6 hours, respectively, at one location other than one’s home location
to the total number of device counts. The staying home device variable is the ratio of the
number of devices that do not leave home locations to the total number of device counts.
MCH Strategy Data provides information on the date of school openings with different
teaching methods (in-person, hybrid, and remote) as well as mitigation strategies at 14703
school districts. We link school district-level MCH data to county-level data from NYT and
SafeGraph using the file for School Districts and Associated Counties at US Census Bureau. School district data is aggregated up to county-level using the enrollment of students
at each district. Specifically, we construct the proportion of students with different teaching methods for each county-day observation using the district-level information on school
opening dates and teaching methods. We define each teaching method’s county-level school
opening date by the weighted mean of district-level school opening dates of the corresponding teaching method with enrollment weights. We also construct a county-level dummy
variable of “No mask requirement for staff,” which takes a value of 1 if there exists at least
one school district. The measure of mask requirements for staff is highly correlated with
other mitigation measures, including mask requirements for students, prohibiting sports activities, and online instruction increases as shown in SI Appendix, Table S3.1 A substantial
fraction of school districts report “unknown” or “pending” for teaching methods and mask
requirements. We drop county observations from the sample if more than 50 percent of
students attend school districts that report unknown or pending teaching methods or mask
requirements for panel regression analysis with teaching methods or mask requirements.

MCH Strategic Data provides the school district level data on whether each school district adopts
following mitigation strategies: (i) mask requirements for staff, (ii) mask requirements for students, (iii)
prohibiting sports activities, and (iv) online instruction increases, among other measures. We decided to use
mask requirements for staff as the primary variable for school mitigation strategy because it has a relatively
lower number of missing values than other mitigation measures.

Our empirical analysis uses 7-day moving averages of daily variables to deal with periodic
fluctuations within a week. SI Appendix, Fig. S4 shows the evolution of percentiles of these
variables over time, while Tables S1-S2 present descriptive statistics and correlation matrix
across variables we use for our regression analysis. The data set contains the maximum
of 3144 counties for regression analysis using foot traffic data but some observations are
dropped out of samples due to missing values for school opening teaching methods and staff
mask requirements in some specifications.2 The analysis was conducted using R software
(version 4.0.3).

Notes: (a)-(b) plot the evolution of weekly cases or deaths per 1000 persons averaged across counties within each
group of counties classified by K-12 school teaching methods and mitigation strategy of mask requirements against
the days since K-12 school opening. We classify counties that implement in-person teaching as their dominant
teaching method into “In-person/Yes-Mask” and “In-person/No-Mask” based on whether at least one school district
requires staff to wear masks or not. Similarly, we classify counties that implement hybrid teaching into
“Hybrid/Yes-Mask” and “Hybrid/No-Mask” based on whether mask-wearing is required for staff. We classify
counties that implement remote teaching as “Remote.” (c) and (d) plot the evolution of the 7-day average of
per-device visits to K-12 schools and full-time workplaces, respectively, against the days since K-12 school opening

restaurants by teaching methods and separately for periods before and after K-12 school
openings. Standard errors for the means that are two-way clustered on county and date
are reported in parentheses. Here and in the event-study analysis, we classify counties into
three groups (in-person, hybrid, and remote) by the dominant teaching method under which
the highest proportion of students are learning within a county.
The school opening dates spread from the beginning of August to late September across
counties, where hybrid teaching is more common than remote or in-person teaching (SI

Appendix, Fig. S4(k)). Reflecting the steady increase in cases from late September to
November of 2020 in the U.S. (SI Appendix, Fig. S4(b)), the growth rates of cases and
deaths, as well as the number of weekly confirmed cases and deaths, are higher in the period
after the school opening compared to the period before. As shown in Table 1, this rise in
cases and deaths after the school opening is more pronounced in the counties with in-person
or hybrid teaching than those with remote teaching. The K-12 school and workplace visits
are also higher after the school openings than before, especially for counties with in-person
and hybrid school openings. On the other hand, the mean per-device restaurant visits do
not change much before and after the school opening, regardless of teaching methods.
Fig. 1 provides visual evidence for the association of opening K-12 schools with the
spread of COVID-19 as well as the role of school mitigation strategies. Fig. 1(a) and
(b) plot the evolution of average weekly cases and deaths per 1000 persons, respectively,
against days since school opening for different teaching methods and mask requirements for
staff. In Fig. 1(a), the average number of weekly cases starts increasing after two weeks of
opening schools in-person or hybrid for counties with no mask mandates for staff, possibly
suggesting that mask mandates at school reduce the transmissions of SARS-CoV-2. In Fig.
1(b), the number of deaths starts rapidly increasing after 3 to 5 weeks of opening schools
for counties that adopt in-person/hybrid teaching methods with no mask mandates. Alternative mitigation strategies of requiring mask-wearing to the student, prohibiting sports
activities, and promoting online instruction also appear to help reduce the number of cases
after school openings (see SI Appendix, Fig. S5(i)-(p)).
Fig. 1(c) shows that opening K-12 schools in-person or hybrid increases the 7-day averages of per-device visits to K-12 schools more than opening remotely, especially when no
mask mandates are in place. Fig. 1(d) and SI Appendix, Fig. S5(e)-(f) show that visits to
full-time and part-time workplaces increase after school openings with in-person teaching,
suggesting that the opening of schools allow parents to return to work.3 On the other hand,
we observe no drastic changes in per-device visits to restaurants, recreational facilities, and
churches after school openings (SI Appendix, Fig. S5(b)-(d)).

2. Event-Study Analysis
We further analyze how cases and deaths change over time after school openings by an
“event-study” analysis (e.g., Callaway and Sant’Anna, 2020; Goodman-Bacon, 2018; Sun
and Abraham, 2020). We divide the sample into three subsamples, where each subsample
contains the observation with similar school opening dates. Then, for each of the subsamples, we run the following regression with weekly dummies of leads and lags for three school
opening modes (i.e., in-person, hybrid, and remote) with county fixed effects but without
3Although the workplace visits appear to start increasing before school opens in Fig. 1(d), this reflects a

measurement error about school opening dates as well as the use of the 7-day average visits. SI Appendix,
Fig. S6(d) shows that a sharp increase in the daily visits to workplaces only happens on the day of school
openings without any increase before for a subset of counties such that the school opening date is the same
across all school districts within a county.

τ < 0) with teaching method p ∈ P := {in-person, hybrid, remote} in county i at day
t. The αi represents a county-county-specific baseline mean i. We consider the event
window of 8 weeks before the school opening and the maximum of 22 weeks after the school
opening, where the lag windows are different across subsamples given that our sample ends
on December 2, 2020.

Figure 2 graphs the estimated coefficients over time with 95 percent confidence intervals
with standard errors clustered by counties: the first subsample uses the county observations
which opened schools before Aug 23, 2020, the second consists of the counties that opened
schools between Aug 24 and Sept 6, and the third uses the counties with the school opening
dates after Sept 7, 2020. The results illustrate that the gap in weekly cases/deaths per 1000
between remote opening and full/hybrid opening grow overtime after the school opening
date for all three subsamples.
We also estimate the dynamic treatment effect of in-person or hybrid school openings, as
well as that of no mask mandates for staffs, relative to remote openings by the estimation
method of Callaway and Sant’Anna (2020) using their did R package. We define a group by
a set of counties with the same school opening date and then estimate the group-time specific
average treatment effect of in-person or hybrid opening using the“never-treated-units” and
“not-yet-treated-units” as the controls while excluding the “already-treated-units” from
the control group. Here, we take the counties with the remote opening plan as the “nevertreated-units.”4 Because almost all counties opened their schools by late September, the
estimated treatment effect for the lags primarily reflects the treatment effect of in-person
or hybrid openings relative to the counties with remote openings rather than the counties
that had not opened schools yet. We report the estimates for the average of the group-time
specific average treatment effects of in-person or hybrid opening against remote opening
across groups with different school opening dates. The result can be causally interpretable
under the group-by-group parallel trend assumption Callaway and Sant’Anna (2020).
Fig. 3 presents the estimated group-time average treatment effects with 95 percent
simultaneous confidence intervals. Fig. 3(a)-(h) show that cases and deaths in counties
with in-person or hybrid openings relative to those with remote openings increase after
school openings; furthermore, these increases are more pronounced for counties without
any mask mandate for staffs in Fig. 3(c)(d)(g)(h). Fig. 3(i)-(p) similarly indicate that
4As discussed in Goodman-Bacon (2018) and Sun and Abraham (2020), two-way fixed effects (TWFE)

regressions with both time fixed effects and unit fixed effects may lead to a biased estimator for the treatment
effect when treatment timings differ across units and, at the same time, the treatment effects are dynamic
and evolve over time. The bias arises because the treatment estimate under TWFE regression partly relies
on the wrong control units that have already been exposed to treatment under the staggered treatment
design.

the figures, the estimates in the pre-treatment period are flat and not statistically different
from zero, consistent with parallel trend assumption.
Consistent with the findings in Fig. 1(c)(d), Fig. 3(q)-(x) show that visits to K-12
schools and full-time workplaces increase after the opening of schools in counties with inperson/hybrid teaching relative to those with remote teaching. In contrast, SI Appendix,
Fig. S5 indicates no evidence for the association of the school opening date with the visits
to restaurants, bars, recreational facilities, and churches, suggesting that other unobserved
county-level confounders that affect people’s mobilities to these places (e.g., lockdown policies) may not be systematically related to the timing of school opening, teaching modes,
and mitigation measures.
Our finding is consistent with Lessler et al. (2021) who examine the data from a massive
online survey and find the association between in-person schooling and COVID-19-related
outcomes across counties and the importance of school-based mitigation measures for reducing transmission risks in the United States. In contrast, using an event-study design,
Isphording, Lipfert, and Pestel (2021) and von Bismarck-Osten, Borusyak, and Schönberg
(2020) find no evidence that fully opening schools increased case number within the 3-4
weeks of school openings in Germany. One possible reason for these contradictory findings
is that the mitigation measures in German schools may have been more effective in containing in-school transmissions than the measures adopted by the US schools with in-person
openings. Another important source of the difference is that the event window length of
3-4 weeks in Isphording, Lipfert, and Pestel (2021) and von Bismarck-Osten, Borusyak, and
Schönberg (2020) may be too short to identify the effect of school openings on the confirmed
cases because asymptomatic, undetected cases are prevalent among children (Leidman et al.,
2021).

3. Dynamic Panel Regression Analysis
While our event-study analysis provides important evidence, the parallel trend assumption might be at odds with the implications of the main epidemiological models that the
spread of cases is highly non-linear and that the current number of cases dynamically depends on the number of past infected individuals through the virus transmission, which in
turn is influenced by school openings, containment policies, and importantly people’s voluntary behavioral changes in response to information (Callaway and Li, 2021; Chernozhukov,
Kasahara, and Schrimpf, 2021). Furthermore, the validity of the parallel trend assumption is sensitive to the transformation of outcome variable Roth and Sant’Anna (2021).
Therefore, as an alternative approach, we analyze the effect of opening K-12 schools on
case growth by panel data regression under the uncounfoundedness assumption, where a
specification is motivated by the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) model.
3.1. Methods. SI Appendix provides the details for our research design which closely
follows Chernozhukov, Kasahara, and Schrimpf (2021). Fig. 4 is a causal path diagram
(see Pearl, 2009) for our model that describes how policies, behavior, and information
interact together:
• The forward health outcome, Yi,t+` , is determined last after all other variables have
been determined;
• The policies, Pit , affect health outcome Yi,t+` either directly, or indirectly through
mediators, human behavior Bit , which may only be partially observed.
• Information variables, Iit , such as lagged values of outcomes can affect human behavior and policies, as well as outcomes directly;
• The confounders Wit , which vary across counties and time, affect all other variables;
these include testing rates and unobserved but estimable county and state-week
effects.

The index i denotes the county i, and t and t + ` denotes the time, where ` represents
the time lag between infection and case confirmation or death. Our health outcomes are

OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19

11

various modes, mask mandates, ban gathering, and stay-at-home orders, while information
variables include lagged values of cases or deaths.
The causal structure allows for the effect of the policy to be either direct or indirect.
For example, school openings not only directly affect case growth through the within-school
transmission but also indirectly affect case growth by increasing parents’ mobility. The
structure also allows for changes in behavior to be brought by the change in policies and
information. The information variables, such as the actual recorded number of past confirmed cases, can cause people to spend more time at home, regardless of adopted policies;
these changes in behavior, in turn, affect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
To further motivate our panel regression specification, we consider the SIRD model:
S(t)
S(t)
β(t)I(t), İ(t) =
β(t)I(t) − γI(t),
N
N
Ṙ(t) = (1 − κ)γI(t), Ḋ(t) = κγI(t),
Ṡ(t) = −

(2)

where S, I, R, and D denote the number of susceptible, infected, recovered, and deceased
individuals in a given state. Each of these variables is a function of time and dots indicate
time derivative. N is the population, β(t) is the rate of infection spread, γ is the rate of
recovery or death, and κ is the probability of death conditional on infection. Confirmed
cases, C(t), evolve as
Ċ(t) = τ (t)I(t),
(3)
where τ (t) is the testing proportion (detection rate). Differentiating the logarithm of [14]
and substituting [11], we have
S(t)
C̈(t)
τ̇ (t)
=
β(t) − γ +
,
N
τ (t)
Ċ(t)

(4)

which indicates that the growth rate of cases depends on the rate of infection spread and
the change in detection rates.
Our empirical specification is a discrete-time analog of equation [15] by approximating
the case growth rate with the log difference in weekly confirmed cases and specifying S(t)
N β(t)
as a linear function of the variable for K-12 school visits, policies, past cases, county fixed
effects, and state-week fixed effects:
X
∆7 log Case it = β 0 Visit i,t−14 +
βy,τ log Case i,t−τ
τ =14,21,28
0

+ γ NPI i,t−14 + θTest it + αi + δs(i),w(t) + it ,

(5)

where i is county, t is day. The outcome variable ∆7 log Case it := log Case it − log Case i,t−7
is the log-difference over 7 days in reported weekly cases with Case it denoting the number
of confirmed cases from day t − 6 to t. For the observation with zero weekly cases, we set
the value of the log of weekly cases, log Case it , to be −1.
Visit i,t−14 includes per-device K-12 school visits and college visits lagged by 14 days from
the SafeGraph foot traffic data (SI Appendix, Fig. S4(c)(f)). The direct measure of K-12
school visits has advantages over that of school opening modes from the MCH data because

12

VICTOR CHERNOZHUKOV, HIROYUKI KASAHARA, AND PAUL SCHRIMPF

the latter is prone to measurement errors caused by unrecorded changes in teaching methods
and school closures beyond the information recorded in the MCH data. The measure of
K-12 school visits may also capture student density heterogeneity within the same opening
mode, especially for the hybrid teaching method.
As confounders, we consider a set of county fixed effects, αi , as well as state-week fixed
effects, δs(i),w(t) . County fixed effects αi control permanent differences across counties in
unobserved personal risk-aversion and attitude toward mask-wearing, hand washings, and
social distancing. The coefficient δs(i),w(t) on the interaction terms between statey dummy
variables and week dummy variables capture any change over time in people’s behaviors
and non-pharmaceutical policy interventions (NPIs) that are common within a state; they
also control for changes in weather, temperature, and humidity within a state. NPI i,t−14
includes county-level NPIs (mask mandates, banning gathering of more than 50 persons,
stay-at-home orders) lagged by two weeks that control for the effect of people’s behavioral
changes driven by county-level policies on case growths. NPI data on stay-at-home orders
and gathering bans is from Jie Ying Wu Killeen et al. (2020) while the data on mask policies
is from Wright et al. (2020). These NPI data contain information up to the end of July;
in our regression analysis, we set the value of these policy variables after August to be the
same as the last day of observations.
Test it is the growth rate of the number of tests recorded at the daily frequency for each
state to capture the changes in detection rates τ̇ (t)/τ (t) in [15]. This variable is important
to fill the gap between confirmed cases and actual infections.
Finally, the logarithm of past weekly confirmed cases denoted by log Case i,t−τ for τ =
14, 21, and 28 are included in [15] as important confounders representing information variables. First, because the timing and the mode of school openings are likely to be affected
by the number of lagged cases or deaths (e.g., the decision to reopen schools in California
and Oregon depended on trends in local case counts (Goldhaber-Fiebert, Studdert, and
Mello, 2020)), controlling for the past weekly cases is critical for the unconfoundedness assumption.5 Second, controlling for past confirmed cases is important because people may
voluntarily change their risk-taking behavior in response to the new information provided
by the confirmed cases rather than the actual, but unknown, number of infected individuals.
We also consider an alternative specification using the proportion of K-12 students attending schools with teaching method p ∈ {in-person, hybrid, remote} constructed from the
MCH data in place of the visits to K-12 schools from the foot traffic data. Furthermore, we
investigate the role of mitigation strategies at school on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
by examining how the coefficients of K-12 school visits and K-12 school openings depend
5Referring to the causal path diagram in Fig. 4, the information variables affect both policies (e.g.,

school openings) and the people’s behavior (see Chernozhukov, Kasahara, and Schrimpf (2021) and Table
3 for empirical evidence). Even if information variables do not affect outcome directly, they are important
confounders because in the terminology of Pearl Pearl (2009), they open a “backdoor” path from outcome to
policy, which creates a non-causal association between policies and outcomes. By controlling for information
variables (and other confounders), we block non-causal associations, revealing the association generated by
the causal effect of policies on outcomes. See our discussion in SI Appendix as well as Pearl (2009) for more
details.

OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19

on the mask-wearing requirement for staff with an interaction term between school opening
variables and a dummy variable for staff mask-wearing requirements.
For parameter identification, we assume that the error it in [5] is orthogonal to the
observed explanatory variables of school visits/openings, NPIs, test rates, and the past
log cases, county fixed effects, and state-week fixed effects. The estimated parameters for
school openings can be causally interpreted under the unconfoundedness assumption that
the variables related to school openings (school visits, opening dates, teaching methods) are
as good as randomly assigned after conditioning on other controls, county fixed effects, and
state-week fixed effects.
Because the fixed effects estimator with a set of county dummies for dynamic panel
regression could be severely biased when the time dimension is short compared to crosssectional dimension (Nickell, 1981), we employ the debiased estimator by implementing bias
correction (e.g., Chen, Chernozhukov, and Fernández-Val, 2019) although the fixed effects
estimator without bias correction gives qualitatively similar results. See SI Appendix, Table
S5 and Fig. S8 for the results from the fixed effects estimator without bias correction.

Result. Table 2 reports the debiased estimates of panel data regression. Clustered standard
errors at the state level are reported in the bracket to provide valid inference under possible
dependency over time and across counties within each state. The results suggest that an
increase in the visits to K-12 schools and opening K-12 schools with in-person learning mode
is associated with an increase in the growth rates of cases with two weeks lag when schools
implement no mask mandate for staff.
In column (1), that of per-device visits to K-12 schools is 0.47 (SE = 0.07). The change
in top 5 percentile values of per-device visits to K-12 schools between June and September
among counties is around 0.15 in SI Appendix, Fig. S4(c). Taking this value as a benchmark for full openings, fully opening K-12 schools may have contributed to (0.47×0.15=) 7
percentage points increase in case growth rates. Column (3) indicates that openings of K-12
schools with the in-person mode are associated with 5 (SE = 2) percentage point increases
in weekly case growth rates. It also provides evidence that openings of K-12 schools with
remote learning mode are associated with lower case growth, perhaps because remote school
opening induces more precautionary behavior to reduce transmission risk.
In column (2), the estimated coefficient of the interaction between K-12 school visits
and no mask-wearing requirements for staff is 0.24 (SE=0.07), providing evidence that
mask-wearing requirements for staff may have reduced the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
at schools. Similarly, in column (4), the coefficients on the interaction of in-person and
hybrid school openings with no mask mandates are positively estimated as 0.04 (SE=0.02)
and 0.05 (SE=0.02), respectively. These estimates likely reflect not only the effect of maskwearing requirements for staff but also that of other mitigation measures. For example,
school districts with staff mask-wearing requirements frequently require students to wear
masks and often increase online instructions.

14

VICTOR CHERNOZHUKOV, HIROYUKI KASAHARA, AND PAUL SCHRIMPF

Other studies on COVID-19 spread in schools have also pointed to the importance of
mitigation measures. In contact tracing studies of cases in schools, Gillespie et al. (2021)
found that 6 out of 7 traceable case clusters were related to clear noncompliance with
mitigation protocols, and Zimmerman et al. (2021) found that most secondary transmissions
were related to absent face coverings. Hobbs et al. (2020) find that children who tested
positive for COVID-19 are considerably less likely to have had reported consistent mask use
by students and staff inside their school.
The estimated coefficient of per-device visits to colleges is 0.14 (SE = 0.07) in column (1)
of Table 2. With the change in top 5 percentile values of college visits between June and
September as a benchmark for full openings, which is about 0.1, fully opening colleges may
be associated with (0.14×0.1=) 1.4 percentage points increase in case growth. Therefore,
the estimated association of opening colleges with case growth is much smaller than that
of opening K-12 schools. Furthermore, alternative specifications in columns (2) and (4)
of Table 2 and those in Fig. 5 yield smaller, and sometimes insignificant, estimates for
college visits. This sensitivity may be due to the limited variation in changes in college
visits over time across counties in the data, where the 75 percentile value of college visits
is consistently very low (SI Appendix, Fig. S4(f)). SI Appendix presents more discussions
on the association of opening colleges with the spread of COVID-19, where Fig. S2 and S3
provide descriptive evidence that opening colleges and universities may be associated with
the spread of COVID-19 in counties where a large public universities are located.
Consistent with evidence from US state-level panel data analysis in Chernozhukov, Kasahara, and Schrimpf (2021), the estimated coefficients of county-wide mask mandate policy
are negative and significant in columns (1)-(4), suggesting that mandating masks reduces
case growth. The estimated coefficients of ban gatherings and stay-at-home orders are also
negative. The negative estimates of the log of past weekly cases are consistent with a
hypothesis that the information on higher transmission risk induces people to take precautionary actions voluntarily to reduce case growth. The table also highlights the importance
of controlling for the test growth rates as a confounder.
Evidence on the role of schools in the spread of COVID-19 from other studies is mixed.
Papers that focus on contract tracing of cases among students find limited spread from
student infections (Zimmerman et al., 2021; Brandal et al., 2021; Ismail et al., 2020; Gillespie
et al., 2021; Falk et al., 2021; Willeit et al., 2021). There is also some evidence that school
openings are associated with increased cases in the surrounding community. Bignami-van
Assche et al. (2021) provides suggestive evidence that school openings are associated with
increased cases in Montreal neighborhoods. Auger et al. (2020) use US state-level data to
argue that school closures at the start of the pandemic substantially reduced the infection.
Three closely related papers also examine the relationship between schools and countylevel COVID-19 outcomes in the US. Goldhaber et al. (2021) examine the relationship
between schooling and cases in counties in Washington and Michigan. They find that inperson schooling is only associated with increased cases in areas with high pre-existing
COVID-19 cases. Similarly, Harris, Ziedan, and Hassig (2021) analyze US county-level
data on COVID-19 hospitalizations and find that in-person schooling is not associated with

OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19

15

increased hospitalizations in counties with low pre-existing COVID-19 hospitalization rates.
The outcome variable of our regression analysis is case growth rates instead of new cases or
hospitalizations. Consistent with Goldhaber et al. (2021) and Harris, Ziedan, and Hassig
(2021), our finding of a constant increase in growth rates implies a greater increase in cases
in counties with more pre-existing cases. Reinbold (2021) finds that counties with hybrid or
remote openings had fewer cases than those with in-person openings but finds no association
of teaching modes with deaths during the first three weeks of the school year in Illinois,.
Our finding on death rates does not necessarily contradict that of Reinbold (2021) because
the three weeks period is too short to identify the effect on deaths, whereas we examine the
effect on deaths after 3 to 5 weeks of openings.
We next provide sensitivity analysis by changing our regression specifications and assumptions about delays between infection and reporting cases as follows:
(1) Baseline specifications in columns (1) and (2) of Table 2.
(2),(3) Alternative time lags of 10 and 18 days for visits to colleges and K-12 schools as
well as NPIs.
(4) Setting the log of weekly cases to 0 when we observe zero weekly cases to compute
the log-difference in weekly cases for the outcome variable.
(5) Add the log of weekly cases lagged by 5 weeks and per-capital cumulative number
of cases lagged by 2 weeks as controls.
(6) Add per-device visits to restaurants, bars, recreational places, and churches lagged
by 2 and 4 weeks as controls.
(7) Add per-device visits to full-time and part-time workplaces and a proportion of
devices staying at home lagged by 2 weeks as controls.
(8) All of (5)-(7).
Because the actual time lag between infection and reporting cases may be shorter or
longer than 14 days, we consider the alternative time lags in (2) and (3). Specification (4)
checks the sensitivity of handling zero weekly cases to construct the outcome variable of the
log difference in weekly cases.
A major concern for interpreting our estimate in Table 2 as the causal effect is that a
choice of opening timing, teaching methods, and mask requirements may be endogenous.
Our baseline specification mitigates this concern by controlling for county-fixed effects,
state-week fixed effects, and the log of past cases. However, a choice of school openings may
still be correlated with time-varying unobserved factors at the county level. Therefore, we
estimate a specification with additional time-varying county-level controls in (5)-(8).
Fig. 5(a) takes column (1) of Table 2 as a baseline specification and plots the estimated
coefficients for visits to colleges and K12 schools with the 90 percent confidence intervals
across different specifications using the debiased estimator; the estimates using the standard
estimator without bias correction are qualitatively similar and reported in SI Appendix, Fig.
S8. The estimated coefficients of K-12 school visits and college visits are all positive across
different specifications, suggesting that an increase in visits to K-12 schools and colleges is
robustly associated with higher case growth. On the other hand, the estimated coefficients

Notes: Dependent variable is the log difference over 7 days in weekly positive cases. Regressors are 7-days moving
averages of corresponding daily variables and lagged by 2 weeks to reflect the time between infection and case
reporting except for test growth rates. All regression specifications include county fixed effects and state-week fixed
effects. The debiased fixed effects estimator is applied. The results from the estimator without bias correction is
presented in SI Appendix, Table S5. Asymptotic clustered standard errors at the state level are reported in bracket.

often become smaller when we add more controls. In particular, relative to the baseline,
adding full-time/part-time workplace visits and staying home devices leads to somewhat
smaller estimated coefficients for K-12 school and college visits, suggesting that opening
K-12 schools and colleges is associated with people returning to work and/or going outside
more frequently.

In Fig. 5(b), the estimated interaction terms of K-12 school visits and no mask-wearing
requirements for staff in column (2) of Table 2 are all positive and significant, robustly
indicating a possibility that mask-wearing requirement for staff may have helped to reduce
the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at schools when K-12 schools opened with the in-person
teaching method.
SI Appendix, Tables S6-S7 provide further robustness checks, showing that the results
are similar even when we use the log of weekly cases in place of the log difference of weekly
cases as the outcome variable.

3.2. Association between School Openings and Mobility. As highlighted by a modeling study for the United Kingdom (Panovska-Griffiths et al., 2020), there are at least two
reasons why opening K-12 schools in-person may increase the spread of COVID-19. First,
opening K-12 schools increases the number of contacts within schools, which may increase
the risk of transmission among children, parents, education workers, and communities at
large. Second, reopening K-12 schools allow parents to return to work and increase their
mobility in general, which may contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 at schools and
workplaces.
To give insight on the role of reopening K-12 schools for parents to return to work and
to increase their mobility, we conduct panel data regression analysis by taking visits to
full-time workplaces and a measure of staying home devices as outcome variables and use
a similar set of regressors as in Table 2 but without taking 2 weeks time lags.
Table 3 shows how the proportion of devices at full-time workplaces and that of staying
home devices are associated with visits to K-12 schools as well as their in-person openings.
In columns (1) and (2), the estimated coefficients of per-device K-12 school visits and
opening K-12 schools for full-time work outcome variables are positive and especially large
for in-person K-12 school opening. Similarly, the estimates in columns (3) and (4) suggest
the negative association of per-device K-12 school visits and opening K-12 schools with the
proportion of devices that do not leave their home. SI Appendix, Table S4 also provides
evidence that the visits to restaurants and bars are positively associated with the visits to
K-12 schools and colleges. This is consistent with a hypothesis that opening K-12 school
allows parents to return to work and spend more time outside. This result may also reflect
education workers returning to work. In columns (3) and (4), the positive coefficient of
current and past log cases suggests that people voluntarily choose to stay home when the
transmission risk is high.
Table 4 presents regression analysis similar to that in Table 2 but including the proportion
of devices at full-time/part-time workplaces and those at home as additional regressors,
which corresponds to specification (7) in Fig. 5. The estimates indicate that the proportion
of staying home devices is negatively associated with the subsequent case growth, while the
proportion of devices at full-time workplaces is positively associated with the case growth.
Combined with the estimates in Table 3, these results suggest that school openings may
have increased the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by encouraging parents to return to work
and to spend more time outside. This mechanism can partially explain the discrepancy
between our findings and various studies that focus on cases among students. Contract
tracing of cases in schools, such as Falk et al. (2021), Zimmerman et al. (2021), Willeit
et al. (2021), Brandal et al. (2021), and Ismail et al. (2020), often finds limited direct
spread among students. On the other hand, Vlachos, Hertegård, and B. Svaleryd (2021)
finds that parents and teachers of students in open schools experience increases in infection
rates.
In columns (1)-(2) of Table 4, the estimated coefficients on K-12 school visits remain
positive and large even after controlling for the mobility measures of returning to work and
being outside home, which are mediator variables to capture the indirect effect of school

OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19

19

openings on case growth through its effect on mobility. The coefficient on K-12 school visits
is approximately 75% as large in Table 4 as in Table 2, suggesting that that within-school
transmission may be the primary channel through which school openings affect the spread
of COVID-19.
Death Growth Regression. We also analyze the effect of school openings on the death
growth by estimating:
X
βy,τ log Death i,t−τ
∆21 log Death it = β 0 Visit i,t−35 +
τ =35,42,49
0

+ γ NPI i,t−35 + αi + δs(i),w(t) + it ,

(6)

where the outcome variable ∆21 log Death it := log Death it − log Death i,t−21 is the log difference over 21 days in reported weekly deaths with Death it denoting the number of reported
deaths from day t − 6 to t. The log of weekly deaths, log Death it , is set to be −1 when
we observe zero weekly deaths. We take the log difference over 21 days rather than 7 days
for measuring death growth because the time lag between infection and death reporting is
stochastic and spreads over at least 2 weeks.6
The explanatory variables in [6] are lagged by 35 days to capture the time lag of infection
and death reporting. Taking a longer time lag than 35 days may capture the effect of school
openings on deaths through the secondary infection better (e.g., an infection from children
to parents/grandparents); therefore, we also consider a lag length of 42 and 49 days.
Fig. 6 illustrates the estimated coefficients of visits to colleges and K-12 schools across
different specifications for death growth regressions. Fig. 6(a) shows that the coefficient
of visits to colleges and K-12 schools are positively estimated for (1) baseline, (2)-(3) an
alternative time lag of 42 and 49 days, (4) setting the log of weekly deaths to 0 when we
observe zero weekly deaths to compute death growth over 3 weeks, and adding more controls
in (5)-(8), providing robust evidence that an increase in visits to colleges and K-12 schools
is positively associated with the subsequent increase in weekly death growth rates. Fig.
6(b) corresponds to Fig. 5(b), showing that the association of K-12 school visits with death
growth is stronger when no mask mandate for staff is in place.
SI Appendix, Table S9 reports the baseline estimates while Table S10 shows those for
the specification with staying home devices and workplace visits. The estimated coefficients
on K-12 school visits remain positive and large even after controlling for the variables of
returning to work and being outside the home in Table S10, suggesting the possible role
of within-school transmission for a rise in deaths after school openings. These results are
consistent with our findings in case growth regressions.

6For deceased persons above 65 years old between March 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021, CDC estimates

that the interquartile range for the number of days from symptom onset to death is (9,25) days while the interquartile range from death to reporting is (4,59) days. See Table 2 of https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/
2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html.

4. Limitations
Our study has the following limitations. First, our study is observational and, therefore,
should be interpreted with great caution. It only has a causal interpretation in a structural
model under the unconfoundedness assumptions that might not hold in reality. While we
present sensitivity analysis with various controls, including county dummies and interactions
of state dummies and week dummies, the decisions to open K-12 schools may be endogenous
and correlated with other unobserved time-varying county-level factors that affect the spread
of COVID-19. For example, people’s attitudes toward social distancing, hand-washing, and
mask-wearing may change over time (which we cannot observe in the data). Their changes

OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19

21

may be correlated with school opening decisions beyond the controls we added to our
regression specifications.
Our analysis is also limited by the quality and the availability of the data as follows.
The reported number of cases is likely to understate true COVID-19 incidence, especially
among children and adolescents because they are less likely to be tested than adults given
that children exhibit milder or no symptoms. This is consistent with CDC data which shows
the lower testing volume and the higher rate of positive test among children and adolescents
than adults (Leidman et al., 2021). County-level testing data is not used because of a lack
of data, although state-week fixed effects control for the weekly difference across counties
within the same state and we also control daily state-level test growth rates.
Because foot traffic data is constructed from mobile phone location data, the data on K12 school visits likely reflects the movements of parents and older children who are allowed
to carry mobile phones to schools and excludes those of younger children who do not own
mobile phones.7
Because COVID-infected children and adolescents are known to be less likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID, the consequence of transmission among children and adolescents
driven by school openings crucially depends on whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
from infected children and adolescents to the older population can be prevented.8 Our
analysis does not provide any empirical analysis on how school opening is associated with
the transmission across different age groups due to data limitations.9 Vlachos, Hertegård,
and B. Svaleryd (2021) show that teachers in open schools experience higher COVID-19
infection rates compared to teachers in closed schools. They also show that this increase in
infection rate also occurs in partners of teachers and parents of students in open schools.
The impact of school openings on the spread of COVID-19 on case growth may be different
across counties and over time because it may depend not only on in-school mitigation
measures but also on contact tracing, testing strategies, and the prevalence of community
transmissions (Goldhaber-Fiebert, Studdert, and Mello, 2020; Ziauddeen et al., 2020). We
do not investigate how the association between school openings and case growths depends
on contact tracing and testing strategies at the county level due to data limitation.

7We also focus on limited Points-Of-Interest: K-12 schools, colleges and universities, restaurants, drinking
places, other recreational places including recreational facilities, and churches. We check the robustness by
including visits to assisted living facilities for the elderly and nursing care facilities as additional controls,
but the results are not sensitive to their inclusion.
8In the meta-analysis of 54 studies on the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Madewell et al. (2020),
estimated household secondary attack rate to child contacts was 16.8%. Miyahara et al. (2021) reports that
household secondary attack rate from children and adolescence to other family members was 23.8% and
higher than other age groups in Japan.
9CDC collects the data on the number of reported cases by age groups from each state whenever such
data is available. However, for many counties, the reported cases by age groups are missing or there exists a
substantial gap between the sum of cases across different age groups reported by CDC and the total number
of cases reported in NYT case data (see, for example, the case of Ingham, MI, in SI Appendix, Fig. S3).

22

VICTOR CHERNOZHUKOV, HIROYUKI KASAHARA, AND PAUL SCHRIMPF

The result on the association between school opening and death growth in Fig. 6 is
suggestive but must be viewed with caution. The time lag between infection and death
is stochastic and spreads over time, making it challenging to uncover the relationship between the timing of school openings and subsequent deaths. Furthermore, while we provide
sensitivity analysis for handling zero weekly deaths to approximate death growth, our construction of the death growth outcome variable remains somewhat arbitrary.
Finally, our result does not imply that K-12 schools should be closed. Closing schools
have negative impacts on children’s learning (Engzell, Frey, and Verhagen, 2021) and may
cause declining physical and mental healths among children and their parents (Takaku
and Yokoyama, 2021; Ford, John, and Gunnell, 2021; Gadermann et al., 2021). On the
other hand, there is emerging evidence of long-term harm on children’s health induced by
COVID (Parcha et al., 2021). The decision to open or close K-12 schools requires careful
assessments of the cost and the benefit by policymakers. However, given their relatively
low implementation costs, our findings strongly support policies that enforce masking and
other precautionary actions at school and prioritizing vaccines for education workers and
elderly parents/grandparents.

5. Supplementary Information Appendix
The Model and Methods.
The Structural Causal Model. Our approach draws on the framework presented in our previous paper Chernozhukov, Kasahara, and Schrimpf (2021). Here we summarize the approach
for completeness, highlighting the main difference (here we do not assume that all relevant
social distancing behavioral variables are observed).
We begin with a qualitative description of the model via a causal path diagram shown
in Figure 7, which describes how policies, behavior, and information interact together:
• The forward health outcome, Yi,t+` , is determined last, after all other variables have
been determined;
• The adopted vector of policies, Pit , affect health outcome Yi,t+` either directly, or
indirectly by altering individual distancing and other precautioanry behavior Bit ,
which may be only partially observed;
• Information variables, Iit , such as lagged values of outcomes and other lagged observable variables (see robustness checks) can affect human behavior and policies,
as well as outcomes;
• The confounding factors Wit , which vary across counties and time, affect all other
variables; these include unobserved though estimable county, time, state, state-week
effects.
The index i denotes observational unit, the county, and t and t + ` denotes the time, where
` represents the typical time lag between infection and case confirmation or death.

Figure 7. The causal path diagram for our model.

Our main outcomes of interest are the growth rates in Covid-19 cases and deaths and
policy variables include school reopening in various modes, mask mandates, ban gathering,

OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19

29

and stay-at-home orders, and the information variables include lagged values of outcome
(as well as other variables described in the sensitivity checks).
The role of behavioral variables in the model is two-fold. First, the presence of these variables in the model requires us to control for the information variables – even when information variables affect outcomes only through policies or behavior. In this case conditioning
on the information blocks the backdoor path (see, Pearl (2009)) creating confounding

Yi,t+` ←− Bit ←− Iit −→ Pit .
Therefore conditioning on the information is important even when there is no direct effect
Iit −→ Yi,t+` . This observation motivates our main dynamic specification below, where
information variables include lagged growth rates and new cases or new deaths per capita.
Second, while not all behavioral variables may be observable, we can still study as the matter
of supporting analysis, the effects of policies on observed behavioral variables (the portion of
time in workplace, restaurants, and bars) and of behavioral variables on outcomes, thereby
gaining insight as to whether policies have changed private behavior and to what extent
this private behavior changed the outcomes (for the analysis, of early pandemic data in this
vein, see our previous paper).
The causal structure allows for the effect of the policy to be either direct or indirect.
The structure also allows for changes in behavior to be brought by the change in policies
and information. These are all realistic properties that we expect from the context of
the problem. Policies such as closures and reopenings of schools, closures or reopening of
non-essential business, and restaurants, affect the behavior in strong ways. In contrast,
policies such as mandating employees to wear masks can potentially affect the Covid-19
transmission directly. The information variables, such as recent growth in the number of
cases, can cause people to spend more time at home, regardless of adopted policies; these
changes in behavior, in turn, affect the transmission of Covid-19.
The causal ordering induced by this directed acyclical graph is determined by the following timing sequence:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

information and confounders get determined at t,
policies are set in place, given information and confounders at t;
behavior is realized, given policies, information, and confounders at t;
outcomes get realized at t+` given policies, behavior, information, and confounders.

The model also allows for direct dynamic effects of information variables on the outcome
through autoregressive structures that capture persistence in growth patterns. We do not
highlight these dynamic effects and only study the short-term effects (longer-run effects get
typically amplified; see our previous paper Chernozhukov, Kasahara, and Schrimpf (2021)
for more details.)

Our quantitative model for causal structure in Figure 7 is given by the following econometric structural equation model:
Yi,t+` (b, p, ι) :=α0 b + π 0 p + µ0 ι + δY0 Wit + εyit ,
0
:=β 0 p + γ 0 ι + δB
Wit + εbit ,

Bit (p, ι)
Pit (ι)

:=p(η

0

(SEM)

ι, Wit , εpit ),

which is a collection of structural potential response functions (potential outcomes), where
the stochastic schocks are decomposed into an observable part δ 0 W and unobservable part
ε. Lower case letters ι, b and p denote the potential values of information, behavior, and
policy variables. The restrictions on shocks are described below.
The observed outcomes, policy, and behavior variables are generated by setting ι = Iit
and propagating the system from the last equation to the first:
Yi,t+` :=Yi,t+` (Bit , Pit , Iit ),
Bit

:=Bit (Pit , Iit ),

Pit

:=Pit (Iit ).

The orthogonality restrictions on the stochastic components are as follows: The stochastic
shocks εyit and εpit are centered and furthermore,
εyit

⊥ (εbit , Pit , Wit , Iit ),

εbit

⊥ (Pit , Wit , Iit ),

εpit

⊥
⊥

(O)

(Wit , Iit ),

where we say that V ⊥ U if EV U = 0. This is a standard way of representing restrictions
on errors in structural equation modeling. The last equation states that variation in policies
is exogenous conditionally on confounders and information variables.
The system above together with orthogonality restrictions (O) implies the following collection of stochastic equations for realized variables:
Yi,t+` = α0 Bit + π 0 Pit + µ0 Iit + δY0 Wit + εyit ,

εyit ⊥ Bit , Pit , Iit , Wit

0
Bit = β 0 Pit + γ 0 Iit + δB
Wit + εbit ,

εbit ⊥ Pit , Iit , Wit

(BPI→Y)
(PI→B)

As discussed below, the information variable includes case growth. Therefore, the orthogonality restriction εyit ⊥ Pit holds if the government does not have knowledge on future
case growth beyond what is predicted by the information set and the confounders; even
when the government has some knowledge on εyit , the orthogonality restriction may hold if
there is a time lag for the government to implement its policies based on εyit .
We stress that our main analysis does not require all components of Bit to be observable.
Main Implication. The model stated above implies the following projection equation:

OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19

Yi,t+` = a0 Pit + b0 Iit + c0 Wit + ε̄it ,

ε̄it ⊥ Pit , Iit , Wit ,

31

(PI→Y)

where
a0 := (α0 β 0 + π 0 ),

b0 := (α0 γ 0 + µ0 ),

0
c0 := (α0 δB
+ δY0 )

This follows immediately from plugging equation (PI → B) to equation (BPI → Y) and
verifying that the composite stochastic shock ε̄it obeys the orthogonality condition stated
in (PI→Y).
The main parameter of interest is the structural causal effect of the policy:
a0 = (α0 β 0 + π 0 ).
It comprises direct policy effect π 0 as well as the indirect effect α0 β 0 , realized by the policy
changing observed and unobserved behavior variables Bit . This coefficient a and b can
estimated directly using the dynamic panel data methods described in more detail below.
As additional analysis, we can estimate the determinants for the observed behavioral
mobility measures– the observed part of Bit .

Identification and Parameter Estimation. The orthogonality equations imply that the main
equation is the projection equation, and parameters a and b are identified if Pit and Iit have
sufficient variation left after partialling out the effect of controls:
Ỹi,t+` =a0 P̃it + c0 I˜it + ε̄it , ε̄it ⊥ P̃it , I˜it ,

(7)

where Ṽit = Vit −Wit0 E[Wit Wit0 ]− E[Wit Vit ] denotes the residual after removing the orthogonal
projection of Vit on Wit . The residualization is a linear operator, implying that (7) follows
immediately from the above. The parameters of (7) are identified as projection coefficients
in these equations, provided that residualized vectors have non-singular variance matrix:
Var(P̃it0 , I˜it0 ) > 0.

(8)

Our main estimation method is the fixed effects estimator, where the county, state, stateweek effects are treated as unobserved components of Wit and estimated directly from the
panel data, so they are rendered (approximately) observable once the history is sufficiently
long. The stochastic shocks {εit }Tt=1 are treated as independent across states and can be
arbitrarily dependent across time t within a state. In other words, the standard errors will
be clustered at the state level. When histories are not long, substantial biases emerge from
cit of Wit (known as the Nickel bias (Nickell, 1981)) and
working with the estimated version W
they need to be removed using debiasing methods. In our context, debiasing changes the
magnitudes of the original biased fixed effect estimator but does not change the qualitative
conclusions reached without any debiasing.

Formulating Outcome and Key Confounders via SIR model. Letting Cit denote
the cumulative number of confirmed cases in county i at time t, our outcome
∆7 log(∆7 Cit ) := log(∆7 Cit ) − log(∆7 Ci,t−7 )

(9)

approximates the weekly growth rate in new cases from t − 7 to t.10 Here ∆7 denotes the
differencing operator over 7 days from t to t − 7, so that ∆7 Cit := Cit − Ci,t−7 is the number
of new confirmed cases from day t and day t − 6.
We chose this metric as this is the key metric for policymakers deciding when to relax
Covid mitigation policies. The U.S. government’s guidelines for state reopening recommend
that states display a “downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period”
(White House, 2020). A negative value of Yit is an indication of meeting these criteria for
reopening. By focusing on weekly cases rather than daily cases, we smooth idiosyncratic
daily fluctuations as well as periodic fluctuations associated with the days of the week.
Our measurement equation for estimating equations (BPI→Y) and (PI→Y) will take the
form:
0
∆7 log(∆7 Cit ) = Xi,t−14
θ + δT ∆7 log(Tit ) + it ,

(M-C)

where i is county, t is day, Cit is cumulative confirmed cases, Tit is the number of tests over
7 days, ∆ is a 7-days differencing operator, it is an unobserved error term. Xi,t−14 collects
other behavioral, policy, and confounding variables, depending on whether we estimate
(BPI→Y) or (PI→Y), where the lag of 14 days captures the time lag between infection and
confirmed case (see MIDAS (2020)). Here
∆7 log(Tit ) := log(Tit ) − log(Ti,t−7 )
is the key confounding variable, derived from considering the SIR model below. We describe
other confounders in the empirical analysis section.
Our main estimating equation (M-C) is motivated by a variant of SIR model, where we
add confirmed cases and infection detection via testing. Let S, I, R, and D denote the
number of susceptible, infected, recovered, and dead individuals in a given state. Each of
these variables are a function of time. We model them as evolving as
S(t)
β(t)I(t)
N
S(t)
İ(t) =
β(t)I(t) − γI(t)
N
Ṙ(t) = (1 − κ)γI(t)
Ṡ(t) = −

Ḋ(t) = κγI(t)

(10)
(11)
(12)
(13)

where N is the population, β(t) is the rate of infection spread, γ is the rate of recovery or
death, and κ is the probability of death conditional on infection.
10We may show that log(∆ C ) − log(∆ C
7 it
7 i,t−7 ) approximates the average growth rate of cases from t − 7

to t.

OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19

33

Confirmed cases, C(t), evolve as
Ċ(t) = τ (t)I(t),

(14)

where τ (t) is the rate that infections are detected.
Our goal is to examine how the rate of infection β(t) varies with observed policies and
measures of social distancing behavior. A key challenge is that we only observed C(t) and
D(t), but not I(t). The unobserved I(t) can be eliminated by differentiating (14) and using
(11) as
S(t)
C̈(t)
τ̇ (t)
=
β(t) − γ +
.
N
τ (t)
Ċ(t)

(15)

We consider a discrete-time analogue of equation (15) to motivate our empirical specification
by relating the detection rate τ (t) to the number of tests Tit while specifying S(t)
N β(t) as a
linear function of variables Xi,t−14 . This results in
0

Structural Interpretation. The component Xi,t−14
θ is the projection
of βi (t)Si (t)/Ni (t) − γ on Xi,t−14 (including testing variable).

Our measurement equation for the growth rate of deaths is based on equation (16) but
account for a 35 day lag between infection and death as
0
∆21 log(∆7 Dit ) = Xi,t−35
θ + it ,

(M-D)

where
∆21 log(∆7 Dit ) := log(∆7 Dit ) − log(∆7 Di,t−21 )

(17)

approximates the weekly growth rate in deaths from t − 7 to t in state i. Sensitivity analysis
also provides results for the case of 28 and 35 lag.
Debiased Fixed Effects Dynamic Panel Data Estimator. We apply Jackknife bias
corrections; see Chen et al. (2020) and Hahn and Newey (2004) for more details. Here, we
briefly describe the debiased fixed effects estimator we use.
Given our panel data with sample size (N, T ), denote a set of counties by N = {1, 2, ..., N }.
We randomly and repeatedly partition N into two sets as N1j and N2j = N \ N1j for
j = 1, 2, ..., J, where N1j and N2j (approximately) contain the same number of counties. For

34

each of j = 1, ..., J, consider two sub-panels (where i stands for county and t stands for the
day) defined by
Sj1 = Sj11 ∪ Sj22 and Sj2 = Sj12 ∪ Sj21
with Sj1k = {(i, t) : i ∈ Nk , t ≤ dT /2e} and Sj2k = {(i, t) : i ∈ Nk , t ≥ bT /2 + 1c} for k = 1, 2,
where d.e and b.c are the ceiling and floor functions. Each of these two subpanels, Sj1 and
Sj2 , includes observations for all cross-sectional units and time periods.
We form the estimator with bias-correction as
J

βSj ∪Sj ,
βbBC := 2βb − βe with βe :=

where βb is the standard estimator with a set of N county dummies while βeSj ∪Sj denotes

empirical analysis, these two cross-over jackknife bias corrected estimators give similar result; in simulation experiments, the first form performed somewhat better, so we settled
out choice on it.
We report asymptotic standard errors with state-level clustering, justified by the standard
asymptotic theory of bias corrected estimators. The rationale for state-level clustering is
that the stochastic shocks in the model can be correlated across counties, especially within
the state. A simple way to model this is to allow for the arbitrary within-state correlation
and adjust the standard errors to account for this (state-level clustering).
Discussion on the Effect of College Visits with Cases and Deaths. Fig. 8 and 9
provide descriptive evidence that opening colleges and universities may be associated with
the spread of COVID-19 in counties where the University of Wisconsin(UW)-Madison,
the University of Oregon, the University of Arizona, the Michigan State University, the
Pennsylvania State University, the Iowa State University, and the University of IllinoisChampaign are located. What happened in Dane county, WI, is also illustrative. The left
panel of Fig. 8 presents the evolution of the number of cases by age groups, the number
of visits to colleges and universities, and the number of visits to bars and restaurants in
Dane county, WI. The first panel shows that the number of cases for age groups of 1019 and 20-29 sharply increased in mid-September while few cases were reported for other
age groups. The second to the fourth panels suggest that this sharp increase in cases
among the 10-29 age cohort in mid-September is associated with an increase in visits to
colleges/universities, bars, and restaurants in late August and early September. The fall

semester with in-person classes at the UW-Madison began on September 2, 2020, when
many undergraduates started living together in residential halls and likely visited bars and
restaurants. This resulted in increases in COVID-19 cases on campus; according to the
letter from Dane County Executive Joe Parisi to the UW-Madison Parisi (2020), nearly
1,000 positive cases were confirmed on the UW-Madison campus by September 9, 2020,
accounting for at least 74 percent of confirmed cases from September 1 to 8, 2020 in Dane
county. The UW-Madison offered no-cost testing to all students and the tests are mandatory
upon returning to campus for those who returned to residence halls (source 1 and source
2). Therefore, an increase in confirmed cases among college-age people in Dane County is
likely to be partly driven by an increase in the number of tests.
One likely reason why college openings may increase cases is that students go out for bars
(KA et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2021), where properly wearing masks and practicing social
distancing are difficult. Table 8 presents how visits to restaurants and bars are associated
with colleges/universities from panel regressions using per-device visits to restaurants and
bars as outcome variables. These results indicate that bar visits are positively associated
with college visits, consistent with a hypothesis that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may
be partly driven by an increase in visits to bars by students.

Notes: Based on observations from April 15, 2020 to December 2, 2020 for the maximum of 3142 counties. The
growth rates of weekly reported cases/deaths over 7 days are measured by the log-difference over 7 days in weekly
cases/deaths in (a) and (b) while the growth rates of weekly deaths over 21 days is measured by the log-difference
over 21 days in weekly cases/deaths in (c). For (a)-(e), the log of weekly cases and deaths is set to be −1 when we
observe zero weekly cases and deaths.

Notes: (a)-(h) plot the evolution of corresponding variables in the title before and after the day of school openings
and corresponding to figures reported in Fig. 1(c)(d) in the main text. (i)-(p) corresponds to Fig.(a)(b) and plot the
evolution of weekly cases or deaths per 1000 persons averaged across counties within each group of counties classified
by K-12 school teaching methods and different mitigation strategies (mask requirements for students, mask
requirements for staffs, allowing for sports activities, and increase in online instructions) against the days since K-12
school opening. In (i) and (m), counties that implement in-person teaching are classified into “In-person/Yes-Mask”
and “In-person/No-Mask” based on whether at least one school district requires students to wear masks or not. In
(k) and (o), counties that implement in-person teaching are classified into “In-person/Yes-Sports” and
“In-person/No-Sports” based on whether at least one school district requires students to allow sports activities or
not. In (l) and (p), counties that implement in-person teaching are classified into “In-person/No-Online” and
“In-person/Yes-Online” based on whether at least one school district answer that no increase in online instruction.
(q)-(x) are similar to (i)-(p) but classify counties by the volume of per-device K-12 school visits and take the
calendar dates instead of the days since opening schools as x-axis, where ”Low,” ”Middle,” and ”High” are
county-day observations of which 14 days lagged per-device K-12 school visits less than the first quartile, between
the first and the third quartiles, and larger than the third quartile, respectively. In (q) and (u), ”Low/No-Mask,”
”Middle/No-Mask,” and ”High/No-Mask” are a subset of low, middle, and high visits groups of counties for which
at least one school district does not require students to wear masks.

Notes: (c) and (d) plot the evolution of per-device visits to K-12 schools and full-time workplaces, respectively,
against the days since K-12 school opening. Here, we restrict our sample to a subset of counties for which the school
opening date is the same across all school districts within a county and the measurement of school visits and
workplace visits is a daily measure rather than 7-days moving average.

Notes: (a) plots the estimates and 95% simultaneous confidence intervals of the average dynamic treatment effect of
in-person openings relative to the counties with remote openings as well as the counties that have not opened yet on
per-devise restaurant visits using a subset of counties with either in-person opening or remote-opening, where we use
the estimation method of Callaway and Sant’Anna (2020) implemented by their did R package. Similarly, (b), (c),
and (d) plots the estimates of the average dynamic treatment effect of school opening with hybrid, in-persion/mask
mandates, and hybrid/mask mandates teaching methods, respectively, using a subset of counties with the
corresponding teaching method as well as remote-opening. (e)-(h), (i)-(l), (m)-(p), and (q)-(t) report the estimates of
the average dynamic treatment effect on drinking places, recreational facilities, churches, and colleges, respectively.

Notes: Dependent variable is the log difference over 7 days in weekly positive cases. Regressors are 7-day moving
averages of corresponding daily variables and lagged by 2 weeks to reflect the time between infection and case
reporting except that we don’t take any lag for the log difference in test growth rates. All regression specifications
include county fixed effects and state-week fixed effects to control for any unobserved county-level factors and
time-varying state-level factors such as various state-level policies as well as 2, 3, and 4 weeks lagged log of cases.
The standard fixed effects estimator without bias-correction is applied. Asymptotic clustered standard errors at the
state level are reported in the bracket. ∗ p<0.1; ∗∗ p<0.05; ∗∗∗ p<0.01

Notes: Dependent variable is the log of weekly positive cases. Regressors are 7-days moving averages of
corresponding daily variables and lagged by 2 weeks to reflect the time between infection and case reporting except
that we don’t take any lag for the log difference in test growth rates. Because the 2 weeks lagged log cases variable
is in the control, the estimated coefficients can be interpreted as the covariate’s association with case growth over 2
weeks. All regression specifications include county fixed effects and state-week fixed effects to control for any
unobserved county-level factors and time-varying state-level factors such as various state-level policies. The debiased
fixed effects estimator is applied. The results from the estimator without bias correction is presented in SI
