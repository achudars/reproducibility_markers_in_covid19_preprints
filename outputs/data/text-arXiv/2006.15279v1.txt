Abstract The first goal of this study is to quantify the magnitude and spatial
variability of air quality changes in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We focus on two pollutants that are federally regulated, nitrogen dioxide (NO2 )
and fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ). NO2 is emitted during fuel combustion
by all motor vehicles and airplanes. PM2.5 is emitted by airplanes and, among
motor vehicles, mostly by diesel vehicles, such as commercial heavy-duty diesel
trucks. Both PM2.5 and NO2 are also emitted by conventional power plants,
although PM2.5 almost exclusively by coal power plants. Observed concentrations at all available ground monitoring sites (240 and 480 for NO2 and
PM2.5 , respectively) were compared between April 2020, the month during
which the majority of U.S. states had introduced some measure of social distancing (e.g., business and school closures, shelter-in-place, quarantine), and
April of the prior five years, 2015–2019, as the baseline. Large, statisticallysignificant decreases in NO2 concentrations were found at more than 65% of
the monitoring sites, with an average drop of 2 parts per billion (ppb) when
compared to the mean of the previous five years. The same patterns are confirmed by satellite-derived NO2 column totals from NASA OMI, which showed
an average drop in 2020 by 13% over the entire country when compared to the
mean of the previous five years. PM2.5 concentrations from the ground monitoring sites, however, were not significantly lower in 2020 than in the past
five years and were more likely to be higher than lower in April 2020 when
compared to the previous five years.
The second goal of this study is to explain the different responses of these
two pollutants, i.e., NO2 was significantly reduced but PM2.5 was nearly unaffected, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis put forward is that
the shelter-in-place measures affected people’s driving patterns most dramatically, thus passenger vehicle NO2 emissions were reduced. Commercial vehicles
(generally diesel) and electricity demand for all purposes remained relatively

unchanged, thus PM2.5 concentrations did not drop significantly. To establish
a correlation between the observed NO2 changes and the extent to which people were actually sheltering in place, thus driving less, we use a mobility index,
which was produced and made public by Descartes Labs. This mobility index
aggregates cell phone usage at the county level to capture changes in human
movement over time. We found a strong correlation between the observed decreases in NO2 concentrations and decreases in human mobility, with over 4
ppb decreases in the monthly average where mobility was reduced to near zero
and around 1 ppb decrease where mobility was reduced to 20% of normal or
less. By contrast, no discernible pattern was detected between mobility and
PM2.5 concentrations changes, suggesting that decreases in personal-vehicle
traffic alone may not be effective at reducing PM2.5 pollution.

1 Introduction
Worldwide, about 91% of the population is exposed to poor air quality. The
World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that on average, 4.2 million people die each year from causes directly attributed to air pollution [45]. Nitrogen
dioxide (NO2 ) is one of a group of highly reactive gases known as nitrogen
oxides (NOx). NO2 can irritate the human respiratory system and is also
harmful to ecosystems by the formation of nitric acid and acid rain [35, 19].
PM2.5 is another harmful air pollutant that consists of microscopic particles
with a diameter smaller than 2.5 µm. These particles can pose a great risk
to human health because they can penetrate into human lungs and even the
bloodstream; PM2.5 is also often associated with poor visibility [36]. NO2 and
PM2.5 are both primary (i.e., they can be directly emitted into the atmosphere) and secondary (i.e., they can also form after chemical reactions in the
atmosphere) pollutants. High concentrations of both are not necessarily found
where their emissions are highest, due to processes such as chemical reactions,
transport, or diffusion. NO2 and PM2.5 are the main focus of this paper because they are among the seven “criteria” pollutants that are regulated at
the federal level by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) via the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
The novel coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, COVID-19 hereafter for brevity) was first identified in Wuhan, China, on December 30, 2019
[44, 7]. Cases started to spread initially in China but quickly expanded to
other countries across the world. COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic
in March 2020 [43]. At the time of this study, over 9 million people have been
affected by the virus, with over 470,000 deaths in 213 countries and territories [46, 16]. COVID-19 first reached the U.S. in February 2020 and since then
it has caused over 120,000 deaths in the span of a few months [6, 16]. The
death rate of COVID-19 is significantly higher among people with cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses [22], which are also strongly connected with air
pollution [15]. Furthermore, new studies suggest that higher concentrations of

Changes in air quality and human mobility in the U.S. during COVID-19

air pollutants result in a higher risk of COVID-19 infection [48] and mortality
[47].
In the U.S., social distancing measures were implemented state by state
with the goal of limiting the spread of the pandemic. In general, closure or nonphysical interaction options (e.g., delivery only) were implemented for schools,
restaurants, and public places of gathering. Businesses, workers, and types of
activities that were deemed essential during the pandemic either continued operating under strict protection measures (e.g., personal protective equipment
(PPE), masks) or switched to online work. Non-essential businesses requiring
physical presence and interaction closed completely (e.g., hair salons, bars,
gyms). The extent of social distancing measures, seriousness of the implementation, and the degree of compliance varied throughout the U.S. Most states
announced some level of social distancing orders starting in mid-March, 2020
[4], often including a mandatory quarantine for people diagnosed with or showing symptoms of the coronavirus. By the beginning of April, almost all states
had a mandatory shelter-in-place or lockdown order [21]. Hereafter, lockdown
and shelter-in-place will be used interchangeably. The social distancing measures have led to drastic changes in mobility and energy use and therefore
changes in emissions of pollutants.
Globally, the COVID-19 outbreak is forcing large changes in economic activities [42]. In China, following the strict social distancing measures, transportation decreased noticeably and, as a result, China experienced a drastic
decrease in atmospheric pollution, specifically CO [42], NO2 , and PM2.5 [49,
42, 24] concentrations in major urban areas. However, emissions from residential heating and industry remained steady or slightly declined [8]. Using
satellite data, Zhang et al. [50] and the National Center for Atmospheric Research [42] reported a 70% and 50% decrease in NOx concentrations in Eastern
China, respectively. Bao and Zhang [1] showed an average of 7.8% decrease
in the Air Quality Index over 44 cities in northern China. Bawens et al. [2]
and Shi and Brasseur [30] reported an increase in O3 concentrations in the
same region. Chen et al. [8], reported that NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations
were decreased by 12.9 and 18.9 µg/m3 , respectively. They estimated that
this improvement in the air quality of China avoided over 10,000 NO2 - and
PM2.5 -related deaths during the pandemic, which could potentially outnumber
the confirmed deaths related to COVID-19 in China [8]. Other researchers also
have proposed that the improvements of air quality during the pandemic might
have saved more lives than the coronavirus has taken [12, 5]. Likewise, Isaifan
[15] argues that the shutting down of industrial and anthropogenic activities
caused by COVID-19 in China may have saved more lives by preventing air
pollution than by preventing infection.
European countries, such as France and Italy, experienced a sharp reduction in their air pollution amid COVID-19 [13]. In Brazil, a significant decrease
in CO concentrations and, to a lower extent, in NOx levels was observed,
while ozone levels were higher due to a decrease in NOx concentrations in
VOC-limited locations [9, 23]. The same findings were observed in Kazakhstan
and Spain, respectively [17, 34]. Likewise, Iran [25] and India [20, 29] reported

4

noticeable improvements in air pollution during the pandemic. Le et al. [18]
looked into the impacts of the forced confinement on CO2 emissions and concluded that global CO2 emissions decreased by 17% by early April compared
to the average level in 2019. They believe that the yearly-mean CO2 emissions
would decrease by 7% if restrictions remain by the end of 2020.
In the United States, as a result of social distancing, states started to experience a dramatic decrease in personal transportation and mobility in general
[14]. Personal vehicle transportation decreased by approximately 46% on average nationwide, while freight movement only decreased by approximately 13%
[27]. Air traffic decreased significantly as well [31]. On-road vehicle transportation is a main source of NOx emissions [37]. Airports too are usually hot spots
for NO2 pollution [24].
The Houston Advanced Research Center (HARC) [3] analyzed the daily averages of hourly aggregated concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
and xylenes (BTEX) across six stations in Houston, USA. They reported a
decrease in BTEX levels in the atmosphere while an intensified formation on
PM2.5 in the region. Similarly, the New York Times reported huge declines in
pollution over major metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, Seattle, New
York, Chicago, and Atlanta using satellite data [28].
While a noticeable number of studies have looked into the correlation between lockdown measures amid COVID-19 and air quality in different countries, none has evaluated air quality for the entire United States. The goals
of this study are to investigate the magnitude and spatial variability of air
quality (NO2 and PM2.5 ) changes in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic
and to understand the relationships between mobility and NO2 changes. An
innovative aspect of this study is that we use an extensive database of ground
monitoring stations for NO2 and PM2.5 (Section 2.1) and a third-party highresolution mobility dataset derived from cellular device movement (Section
2.3). In addition, we included satellite-retrieved NO2 information to increase
the spatial data coverage (Section 2.2). Whereas most studies rely only on
a comparison to 2019, we consider five prior years (2015–2019) to provide a
more robust measure.

2 Data
2.1 Air quality data
Criteria pollutant concentration data, originally measured and quality-checked
by the various state agencies, are centrally collected and made available to the
public by the EPA through their online Air Quality System (AQS or AirData)
platform [38]. For NO2 , the reported concentrations are one-hour averages,
thus 24 records are reported daily (if no records are missing). For PM2.5 , the
reported concentrations are 24-hour averages, thus one value is reported per
day. The AQS pre-generated files are updated twice per year: once in June,
to capture the complete data for the prior year, and once in December, to

Changes in air quality and human mobility in the U.S. during COVID-19

5

capture the data for the summer. The daily files, containing daily-average and
daily-maximum of one-hour NO2 concentrations and 24-hour-average of PM2.5
concentrations, were downloaded for the years 2015–2019. At the time of this
study (May 2020), however, the pre-generated files for April 2020 were not yet
available.
For the year 2020 only, the data source was the U.S. EPA AirNow program
[39], which collects real-time observations of criteria pollutants from over 2,000
monitoring sites operated by more than 120 local, state, tribal, provincial, and
federal agencies in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. As stated on AirNow website, “these data are not fully verified or validated and should be considered
preliminary and subject to change.” Of the two types of files available from
AirNow, namely AQObsHourly and Hourly, AQObsHourly files were downloaded for March and April 2020 because of their smaller file size (they are
updated once per hour, as opposed to multiple times). Texas and New York
do not feed NO2 measurements to Airnow, thus their 2020 NO2 data were
downloaded directly from their state websites [32, 26].
The NAAQS for NO2 and PM2.5 are based on the comparison of a “design
value”, which is a specific statistic of measured concentrations over a specific
time interval, against a threshold value as follows:

– NO2 : annual mean of 1-hour concentrations may not exceed 53 parts per
billion (ppb);
– NO2 : 98th percentile of 1-hour daily maximum concentrations, averaged
over 3 years, may not exceed 100 ppb;
– PM2.5 : annual mean of 24-hour concentrations, averaged over 3 years, may
not exceed 12 µg/m3 ;
– PM2.5 : 98th percentile of 24-hour concentrations, averaged over 3 years,
may not exceed 35 µg/m3 .

Clearly it is not possible to calculate the design values as early as April
because neither the annual average nor the 98th percentile can be calculated
after only four months. As such, in this study we will use a simple monthly
average as the representative metric to compare the concentrations in April
2020 to those in the previous five Aprils.
An air quality station, whether measuring NO2 or PM2.5 , was used in this
study only if it reported both in 2020 (through AirNow) and in the five years
prior (through AQS). In addition, only air quality stations that were reporting
at least 75% of the time were retained. Note that not all NO2 -measuring sites
also measure PM2.5 , and vice versa. Of the 426 and 882 sites that measured
NO2 and PM2.5 , respectively, in April 2020, only 271 and 819 reported at least
75% of the time, and ultimately only 201 and 480 reported NO2 and PM2.5
also in April 2015–2019 for at least 75% of the time. These are the sites that
we will focus on in this study and that are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

2.2 Satellite data
Satellite observations for NO2 were acquired using the OMI instrument flying
onboard the NASA AURA satellite, and were downloaded using the NASA
GIOVANNI portal [40]. Specifically, the Nitrogen Dioxide Product (OMNO2d)
was used, which is a Level-3 global gridded product at a 0.25x0.25 spatial
resolution provided for all pixels where cloud fraction is less than 30%. The
product comes in two variants, the first measuring the concentration in the
total column and the second the concentration only in the troposhere. For this
work, the latter measurements were used.
The satellite-derived NO2 column totals at the pixels of the ground monitoring sites are well correlated with the NO2 concentrations recorded at the
ground monitoring sites in all years, with R-square values varying between
0.76 and 0.80. As an example, we show the correlation between the two in
2016 and 2020 in Figure 1. As such, we can use satellite-derived NO2 column
totals to: 1) confirm the results obtained from the ground monitoring sites and
2) analyze pixels where no ground monitoring sites are available.

2.3 Mobility data
Mobility measures aim to capture general patterns of observed movement and
most available data products today utilize mobile device activity as a proxy.
While policy makers set social distancing guidance, there are various policies enacted and various degrees to which policies are followed throughout the
country. We seek to observe actual patterns of movement by using a dataset developed by Descartes Labs [11] that provides an aggregated mobility measure
based on anonymized and/or de-identified mobile device locations. Mobility
is essentially a statistical representation of the distance a typical member of
a given population moves in a day. Descartes Labs calculated the farthest
distance apart recorded by smartphone devices utilizing select apps (with location reporting enabled) for at least 10 uses a day, spread out over at least
8 hours in a day, with a day defined as 00:00 to 23:59 local time [41]. The
maximum distance for each qualifying device is tied to the origin county in
which the anonymized user is first active each day. Aggregated results at the
county level are produced as a statistical measure of general travel behavior.
Mobility data are ultimately provided as percent of normal, i.e., the ratio
of aggregated mobility during each day of the COVID-19 pandemic over that
of the baseline (17 February–7 March 2020). Note that the baseline period is
in late winter 2020, whereas the period of focus in this paper is April 2020,
in spring. As such, a fraction of the differences in mobility may be due to
differences in weather and/or climate rather than to COVID-19 restrictions.
We did not attempt to correct for this type of bias. Another caveat, noted
by the the producers of the data [41], is that the raw data used to calculate
mobility are available for only a small fraction of the total number of devices
(a few percent at most), thus the resulting mobility may or may not truly

Changes in air quality and human mobility in the U.S. during COVID-19

represent the average behaviour in each county. Nonetheless, the effects of
these sampling errors are expected to be small. The mobility data are made
freely available by Descartes Labs at the U.S. county level [10].

3 Results
3.1 Observed air quality changes
In the rest of this paper, we will compare the monthly-average of the pollutant
of interest – NO2 or PM2.5 – during the month of April 2020 to the average of
the five monthly-averages during April of the years 2015 through 2019. There
are two reasons for this choice. First, using five years to establish a reference
is more meaningful than, say, using just the year 2019, because year-to-year
variability can occur regardless of the pandemic. In fact we found that, in
general, the year 2019 was relatively clean when compared to the previous five,
thus a comparison between April 2020 and April 2019 may under-estimate the
true impact of COVID-19. Second, although the monthly-average is not the
design value for either NO2 or PM2.5 , it is a value that is representative of the
overall air quality during the entire month of April. Alternative metrics, such
as the monthly maximum, are more representative of extreme circumstances,
like wildfires, that are not necessarily associated to COVID-19.
Starting with NO2 , the April 2020 averages were generally below the April
2015–2019 average at the ground monitoring sites, as most sites lay below the
1:1 line in Figure 2b. In addition, 65% of the sites were characterized by NO2
concentrations in 2020 that were lower than those in all of the previous five
years (for the month of April). Only a few sites (5 in total, < 2%) experienced
NO2 concentrations in 2020 that were higher than those in all of the previous
five years (for the month of April). The average drop in NO2 concentrations
was -2.02 ppb (Tables 1 and 3).
The same pattern is confirmed in the satellite-derived data. Out of the
227 pixels with ground monitoring sites, a total of 127 (56%) exhibited lower
NO2 in 2020 than in the previous five years and only 5% higher (Figure 2b).
Once all 14,706 pixels with valid satellite retrievals all over the country are
considered, a similar pattern of lower NO2 column totals in 2020 than in the
five previous years emerges from these data too (Figure 2c), but with 28% of
the pixels lower in 2020 than in the previous five years and 5% higher (for the
month of April, Table 3).
In terms of spatial variability, Figure 3 shows that, although NO2 reductions were recorded all over the country, the highest decreases were observed
in California and the Northeast, where the shelter-in-place measures started
earlier (March 11 for California, the earliest in the country, and March 22 for
New York, third earliest [21]) and lasted longer (both states still have major restrictions in place as of June 10, 2020 [33]). Noticeable exceptions were
North Dakota and Wyoming, where either no significant decreases or actual
small increases in NO2 concentrations were observed. North Dakota enforced

8

Cristina L. Archer1 et al.

no shelter-in-place measures and in Wyoming only the city of Jackson implemented a stay-at-home order as of April 20, 2020 [21]. However, as discussed
in Section 2.3, actual people’s mobility, as opposed to state ordinances, is a
better metric to understand the real effect of COVID-19 on air quality because
not everybody in all counties followed the state- or county-restrictions all the
time.
Figure 3 was useful because it included actual NO2 concentrations measured near the ground. However, the spatial coverage was sparse and urban
areas were over-sampled compared to rural areas. This weakness is addressed
via the NASA OMI satellite data, which are shown in Figure 5 as the difference between the monthly average of NO2 column total in 2020 and that in
2015–2019 for the month of April. The regions with low coverage of ground
concentration of NO2 and mobility in the Midwest are generally characterized
by near-normal NO2 column totals. The Northeast hotspot of low mobility is
also a hotspot of low NO2 , consistent with [2], although it is surrounded by
patches of above-normal values that were not detectable from the ground monitoring stations. The Los Angeles area is another hotspot of NO2 decreases,
as for low mobility. For PM2.5 , the ground monitoring stations depict a completely different response to COVID-19. Whereas most NO2 sites were laying
below the 1:1 line (Figure 2a), the majority of PM2.5 sites laid above it (Figure
2b), indicating an overall increase in monthly-average PM2.5 in the country
in April 20202 with respect to the previous five years. Only 18% of the sites
reported concentrations of PM2.5 that were lower in 2020 than in the previous five years (in the month of April), while 24% of the stations reported the
highest levels in 2020 compared to the previous five years (for the month of
April). The average increase in PM2.5 concentrations was small, +0.05 µg/m3
(Tables 2 and 3).
In summary, we report a large decrease (-2.02 ppb, or 27%) in monthlyaverage NO2 concentrations across the U.S. ground monitoring stations, confirmed by the satellite-derived NO2 column total decrease of 7.1 ×1014 molecules/cm2
(or 24%) at the pixels of the ground monitoring stations during April of 2020
when compared to April of the previous five years. When all the pixels with
valid data were included, a drop of 2.4×1014 molecules/cm2 (or 13%) during April of 2020 was observed when compared to April of the previous five
years (Table 3). The monthly-average of PM2.5 , however, increased slightly
on average (+0.05 µg/m3 when compared to the previous five-year average)
during the same period (Table 3). In the next Section 3.3, we try to explain
the reasons for these differences.

3.2 Observed mobility changes
Time series of mobility data at the counties with NO2 ground monitoring sites
are shown in Figure 6a and at the counties with PM2.5 ground monitoring sites
in Figure 6b. Only a few counties had both types of monitoring sites, thus the
counties included in the two figures are generally different. Yet, the patterns

Changes in air quality and human mobility in the U.S. during COVID-19

9

are very similar. First of all, mobility on average dramatically dropped starting
in the second half of March, reaching values around 20% by April, and then
started to recover in May, as some states reopened for business or relaxed the
shelter-in-place measures [33]. Second, a distinct minimum in mobility during
the month of April is clearly visible, which confirms that this month was the
most relevant for air quality impacts from COVID-19. There is some variability
around this general behaviour, but nonetheless only a few counties barely
reached normal mobility in April. Lastly, the typical traffic reduction during
the weekends is confirmed in the mobility data, regardless of the pandemic.
This adds confidence to the use of mobility data as proxies for people’s actual
behaviours.
In terms of spatial variability, changes in mobility during COVID-19 in
the U.S. were not uniform, although in general mobility was reduced in most
states (Figure 7a). Note the high count of non-valid data in many counties
in the Midwest (Figure 7b), possibly due to low population density. However,
the ground monitoring stations of both NO2 and PM2.5 are generally located
in counties with high data availability. In general, the strongest decreases in
mobility are found around large urban areas throughout the country, e.g., the
Northeast corridor from Washington D.C. to Boston; the San Francisco and
Los Angeles areas in California; Seattle in the Northwest; and Chicago. A
few isolated counties experienced increases in mobility (in red in Figure 7a).
Wyoming stands out as one of the few states with no significant decreases in
mobility, consistent with the lack of shelter-in-place measures [21].

3.3 Relationships between air quality and mobility changes
To better interpret the relationship between mobility and the air pollutant
of interest, either NO2 or PM2.5 , the mobility data were divided into bins,
based on the monthly-average (in April 2020) of the mobility in the county
where each ground monitoring site was located. For most cases, there was
only one ground monitoring site per county. But in some cases, such as Los
Angeles county in California for NO2 or Maricopa county in Arizona for PM2.5 ,
multiple monitoring sites were located in the same county and therefore they
were all paired to the same mobility value. The change in monthly-average
concentration of the pollutant between April 2020 and the five previous Aprils
was then calculated for each mobility bin.
Starting with NO2 , there is a clear relationship with mobility (Figure 8a).
Large and negative changes in NO2 concentrations, of the order of -4 ppb, were
found at locations where mobility was basically halted, i.e., where it was less
than 1% of normal in April 2020, as in full lock down. As mobility increased,
the NO2 benefits decreased, although not linearly. For example, decreases by
2–3 ppb in NO2 concentrations occurred where mobility was restricted but
not to a full lock down (i.e., between 1% and 20% of normal). Past 20%,
the changes in NO2 concentrations were still negative and significant, but not
large, less than 1 ppb on average. This suggests that NO2 responds modestly

10

Cristina L. Archer1 et al.

to changes in mobility that are not large, but then, if mobility is reduced
dramatically (i.e., by at least 80%, thus it is down to 20% of normal), large
decreases in NO2 can occur.
With respect to PM2.5 , there is no obvious relationship between the reductions in mobility and the observed concentrations (Figure 8b). Only for the
most extreme mobility reductions, i.e., the bin with <1% mobility, which indicates that the entire population was sheltering at home for the entire month
of April, PM2.5 concentrations decreased by about 1 µg/m3 . After the first
bin, as mobility increased, both increasing and decreasing concentrations of
PM2.5 were found, with large standard deviations and no discernible pattern.
We conclude that the changes in PM2.5 were not directly caused by changes
in people’s mobility.
How can we reconcile the clear relationship of NO2 with mobility with the
lack thereof for PM2.5 ? The hypothesis we put forward is that the shelterin-place measures affected mostly people’s driving patterns, thus passenger
vehicle – mostly fueled by gasoline – emissions were reduced and so were
the resulting concentrations of NO2 . Commercial vehicles (generally diesel)
and electricity demand for all purposes (often provided by coal-burning power
plants), however, remained relatively unchanged, thus PM2.5 concentrations
did not drop significantly and did not correlate with mobility. To test this
hypothesis, in a subsequent study we will use a photochemical model, coupled
with a numerical weather prediction model, which we will run with and without
emissions from diesel vehicles, while keeping everything else the same. The
difference between the concentrations of the pollutants in the two cases will be
attributable to diesel traffic alone. Similarly, we will be able to reduce emissions
from other sectors, to reflect the effect of COVID-19 on other aspects of life,
such as air traffic or business closures.

4 Conclusions and future work
This study analyzed the effects of COVID-19 on air quality, more specifically
NO2 and fine particulate PM2.5 concentrations, in the U.S. Although different
states introduced different levels of shelter-in-place and social distancing measures at different times, by the beginning of April 2020 all states but a few had
adopted some restrictions. As such, the analysis focused on the month of April
2020, which was compared to April of the previous five years, 2015–2019.
Two types of measurements were used, NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations from
the ground monitoring stations – maintained by the states – and satellitederived NO2 column totals in the troposphere. Although the two measurements are not identical, they are strongly correlated with one another because
the near-ground concentrations of NO2 are the dominant contributors to the
tropospheric column total.
To quantify social distancing, we used the mobility index calculated and
distributed by Descartes Labs. Their algorithms account for people’s maximum
distance travelled in a day by tracing the user’s location multiple times a day

11

while using selected apps. Mobility is represented as a percent value, such that
100% means normal conditions, i.e., those during the period of 17 February –
7 March 2020.
We found that NO2 levels decreased significantly in April 2020 when compared to April of the five previous years, by up to 8 ppb in the monthly average
at some locations. On average over all U.S. monitoring sites, the decrease in
NO2 levels was between 24% (from satellite) and 27% (from ground stations).
The decreases in NO2 were largest where mobility was reduced the most, with
a direct, although not linear, relationship between the two. In terms of spatial variability, hotspots of reduced NO2 concentrations in the Northeast and
California coincided perfectly with hotspots of reduced mobility. Vice versa,
states where social distancing measures were minimal experienced the smallest
reduction in NO2 , e.g., Wyoming and North Dakota.
By contrast, the concentrations of PM2.5 did not decrease significantly during the same period and even reached unprecedented high values at about a
fifth of the sites. In addition, changes in PM2.5 concentrations were not correlated with changes in people’s mobility, neither spatially nor as aggregated
statistics.
We propose that the different response to reduced people’s mobility between NO2 and PM2.5 could be explained by the fact that commercial vehicles (including delivery trucks, buses, trains), generally diesel fueled, remained
more or less in circulation, while passenger vehicles, gasoline fueled, dropped
dramatically due to COVID-19. PM2.5 emissions are much larger from diesel
than from gasoline vehicles. In addition, other sources of PM2.5 emissions, like
power plants, did not decrease. We plan to verify this hypothesis in a subsequent study using a photochemical model coupled with a numerical weather
prediction model, as described in Section 3.3.
As far as we know, this is the first study to use ground monitoring stations
to assess the effects of COVID-19 on air quality in the U.S. Satellite-derived
NO2 column totals have been used in a few previous studies, but none looked
at the correlation between the two types of NO2 measurements. Another innovation of this study is the use of mobility data, which are an excellent proxy
for actual people’s behaviour, as opposed to the state or county regulations,
which may or may not be fully followed by people.
This analysis has also numerous limitations. First of all, we paired mobility data and pollutant concentrations at the county level, thus we implicitly
assumed that the measured concentration and county-average mobility were
representative of the entire county. For large counties, especially those with
also low population density, this assumption may not hold. The second implicit assumption of our pairing is that local mobility affects local pollution
only and, vice versa, that local pollution is affected by local mobility only. In
other words, we are neglecting the effects of transport and chemical reactions,
which could cause either an increase or a decrease of pollution regardless of
the local mobility change in the county of interest. For example, consider the
case that the prevailing wind is such that a county is located downwind of an
airport. If the airport was shutdown during the pandemic, that county would

see a reduction of NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations even if no social distancing
measures were in place. Another limitation is that we looked at people’s mobility as the only factor explaining NO2 concentration changes, whereas NO2
emissions changed also in response to business and school closures, air traffic
reductions, among many others sources. Lastly, we focused on two pollutants
only, NO2 and PM2.5 , because of time constraints; future work will include
other regulated compounds, such as ozone and carbon monoxide.

Fig. 2 Scatter plots of: (a) NO2 and (b) PM2.5 observed concentrations at ground monitoring sites, and NO2 column totals from NASA OMI satellite at (c) pixels of the ground
monitoring sites and (d) all pixels during April of 2020 (y-axis) versus April of the previous
five years 2015–2019 (x-axis). Blue-filled markers represent sites for which the values in April
2020 were lower than in any April of 2015–2019; red-filled markers represent sites for which
the values in April 2020 were higher than in any April of 2015–2019.

Fig. 3 Difference in monthly-average NO2 concentrations (ppb) between April 2020 and
the five previous Aprils (2015–2019). Negative values (blue) indicate a decrease in NO2
concentrations in April 2020, vice versa positive values (red) indicate an increase.
