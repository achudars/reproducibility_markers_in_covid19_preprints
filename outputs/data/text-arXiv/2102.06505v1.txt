Abstract
During the first wave of Covid-19 information decoupling could be observed in the flow of news media
content. The corollary of the content alignment within and between news sources experienced by
readers (i.e., all news transformed into Corona-news), was that the novelty of news content went
down as media focused monotonically on the pandemic event. This all-important Covid-19 news
theme turned out to be quite persistent as the pandemic continued, resulting in the, from a news
media’s perspective, paradoxical situation where the same news was repeated over and over. This
information phenomenon, where novelty decreases and persistence increases, has previously been used
to track change in news media, but in this study we specifically test the claim that new information
decoupling behavior of media can be used to reliably detect change in news media content originating
in a negative event, using a Bayesian approach to change point detection.

Introduction
A peculiar behavior could be observed in news media when the first wave of Covid-19 virus
spread across the world. In response to this pandemic event, the ordinary rate of change in
news content was disrupted because every story became associated with Covid-19. On the one
hand, content novelty went down, because every story became more similar to previous stories,
but on the other hand, the Covid-19 association became more prevalent, resulting in, at least
initially, an increase in content persistence. A recent study [1] argues that this behavior is an
example of the news information decoupling (NID) principle, according to which information
dynamics of news media are (initially) decoupled by temporally extended catastrophes such
that the content novelty decreases as media focus monotonically on the catastrophic event, but
the resonant property of said content increases as its continued relevance propagate throughout
the news information system. The authors further argued NID can be used to detect significant
change in news media that originate in catastrophic events.
Previous studies have shown that variation in newspapers’ word usage is sensitive to the

dynamics of socio-cultural events [2, 3, 4], can detect event-driven shifts [5], and accurately
can model effects of change in comprehensive collections of newspapers [6]. Furthermore, the
associative structure of newspapers has been shown to accurately capture thematic development [7], and, when modelled dynamically, is indicative of the evolution of cultural values
and biases [3, 8]. Adaptive fractal analysis of word frequencies over time has been used to
discriminate between different classes of catastrophic events that display class-specific fractal signatures in, among other things, word usage in newspapers [9]. Several studies have
shown that information theoretical construct can be used to detect fundamental conceptual
differences between distinct periods [2], concurrent normative and ideological movements [10],
and even, development of ideational factors (e.g., creative expression) in temporally dependent
writings [11, 12, 13]. More specifically, a set of methodologically related studies studies have
applied windowed relative entropy to thematic text representations to generate signals that
capture information novelty as a reliable content difference from the past and resonance as
the degree to which future information conforms to said novelty [10, 11]. Three recent studies
have found that successful social media content show a strong association between novelty and
resonance [14], that legacy news media under normal conditions display a remarkably similar
medium to strong association between novelty and resonance across the political spectrum [1],
and, finally, that variation in the novelty-resonance association can predict significant change
points in historical data [15].
This study specifically tests the claim of [1] that NID-like behavior can provide input for
change point detection algorithms. Specifically, we propose to test the claim that two change
points are observable in news media during the first phase of Covid-19, Lockdown and Opening
respectively, using a Bayesian approach to change point detection.

Results
Figure 1 displays a prototypical example of NID during the first phase of Covid-19 [1]. Although
Covid-19 news items date back to December 2019, ‘W uhan’, newspaper content is not impacted
until the period after the first national outbreak (in this case in Denmark). ‘V irus‘. From
the phase 1 lockdown ‘Lockdown‘ to the opening, ‘Opening‘, the newspaper shows a valley in
novelty and, initially, a peak in resonance until both processes approximately return to normal
after the opening.

model, see Appendix A for methods. The first change point, ‘N ID Start‘ should separate prelockdown from lockdown centered on week 11, and the second lockdown, ‘N ID End‘ from post
opening (centered on week 16). Table 1 shows the estimated change points for six national
newspapers, two of which are T abloid newspapers (Class) and the remainder Broadsheet.
From the model, it can be observed that all broadsheet newspapers seem to support the NID
principle in novelty. The first change point is placed in weeks 10-11, the second, however, is
more a matter of contention. The opening change point lies within April and displays a month’s
delayed response. Finally, it can be observed that tabloid press shows no indication of NID
behavior. Table 2 and figure 2 show the posterior distributions, their means and highest density
intervals, for four broadsheet and one tabloid newspaper, clearly indicating that broadsheet
newspapers do conform to NID, while tabloids do not.

That novelty decreases during a catastrophic event is nevertheless only half the story. For
NID to be supported by the data, resonance should increase during the lockdown such that

the medium to strong association between novelty and resonance is momentarily weakened.
Following [1], we inspected the time-windowed linear fits of resonance on novelty, N × R, in
order to confirm this, see figure 3. All broadsheet newspapers display a slope decrease during
the lockdown, thereby conforming to the NID principle 3. Tabloids on the other hand, follow
an inverse pattern, such that the N × R slope increases during the lockdown period.

Concluding Remarks
In conclusion, this study sought to validate the news information decoupling (NID) principle
on a sample of six national Danish newspapers during the first phase of Covid-19. Using a
Bayesian approach to change point detection, we found that content novelty in broadsheet
newspapers does indeed display statistically reliable points of change during the Covid-19
lockdown. NID was further corroborated by the N × Rpre slopes that indicated a decoupling
of resonance from novelty during the lockdown. Several observations can be made from the

(middle row), and Politiken (lower row) during Covid-19 phase 1.

findings. First, the estimated change points for the ‘Pre-lockdown → Lockdown’ are spread
over a two week interval, which reflects that a lockdown could be reasonably predicted already
from the first Covid-19 incident in Denmark. Second, in a similar vein the ‘Lockdown →
Opening‘ change points are spread over an entire month from April 8 to May 8. The Danish
government during the period was center-left and model’s uncertainty in determining the opening may reflect political observations [1], where center-right newspapers (e.g., Berlingske and
Jyllands-Postern) were more sceptical towards the government’s implementation of an opening
than the center-left (e.g., Politiken). In other words, the center-right might have been more
reluctant to acknowledge the opening as a return to normal. Third, tabloid newspapers do not
show any indication of a news decoupling, on the contrary, their N × Rpre slopes momentarily
increases during the lockdown . This increase in slopes does, however, not provide much useful

information, because, as shown by the change point detection model, the periodization is not
meaningful to the two tabloid newspapers.
Validation of the NID principle is still needed for multilingual data and its value for crisis
management should be further tested. For change detection, the scope of the principle needs
additional testing; does NID generalize beyond a small set of negative events to, for instance,
temporally extended significant events (e.g., moon landing, fall of the Berlin Wall). Finally,
several comparisons already hinted that left vs. right-wing newspapers, tabloid vs. broadsheet newspapers, silly season and other seasonal effects, are interesting venues for media and
journalism researchers.

Appendix
A. Methods
Data and Normalization
The data set consists of all linguistic content (title and body text) from front pages of six
Danish national newspapers Berlingske, BT, Ekstrabladet, Jyllands-Posten, Kristligt Dagblad,
and Politiken. The newspapers were sampled during December 1, 2019 to July 1 2020. Content
not produced by the newspaper, e.g., advertisements, was excluded from the sample. In order
to normalize linguistic content, numerals and highly frequent function words were removed, and
the remaining data were lemmatized and casefolded. Subsequently, the data were represented
as a bag-of-words (BoW) model using latent Dirichlet allocation in order to generate a dense
low-rank representation of each article. Note that with a few modifications to equations (4) and
(5), the approach works for any probabilistic or geometric vector-representation of documents.
Novelty and resonance were estimated for in windows of one week (w = 7).

Novelty and Resonance
Two related information signals were extracted from the temporally sorted BoW model: Novelty as an article s(j) ’s reliable difference from past articles s(j−1) , s(j−2) , . . . , s(j−w) in window
w:
w
1 ∑︂
Nw (j) =
JSD(s(j) | s(j−d) )
w

d=1

and resonance as the degree to which future articles s(j+1) , s(j+2) , . . . , s(j+w) conforms to
article s(j) ’s novelty:
Rw (j) = Nw (j) − Tw (j)

(2)

where T is the transience of s(j) :
Tw (j) =

w
1 ∑︂
JSD(s(j) | s(j+d) )
w

(3)

d=1

The novelty-resonance model was originally proposed in [10], but here we propose a symmetrized and smooth version by using the Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD):

1

JSD(s(j) | s(k) ) = D(s(j) | M ) + D(s(k) | M )

with M = 12 (s(j) + s(k) ) and D is the Kullback-Leibler divergence:

Finally, in order to describe the information states before and after an events (e.g., Lockdown,
Opening), we fit resonance on novelty to estimate the N × R slope β1 in the specific time
windows:
Ri = β0 + β1 Ni + ϵi , i = 1, . . . , n.

Bayesian Change Point Detection
For the estimation of change points, a Bayesian approach was used. Following previous considerations, we assume that the time series contains two change points, τ1 and τ2 . Aside from
change points, the series is assumed to be stable and follow a normal distribution with varied mean, µi , and singular variance, σ. This gives us the following model given the observed
Novelty, Ni :
⎧
⎪
⎨N (µ1 , σ) for t < τ1
Nt = N (µ2 , σ) for τ1 ≤ t < τ2
(7)
⎪
⎩
N (µ3 , σ) for t ≥ τ2
for which we wish to estimate the location of the change points τi , means µi and variance
σ, i.e. the following posterior:
P (µi , σ, τi |Nt ) = P (µ1 , µ2 , µ3 , σ, τ1 , τ2 |Nt )
For estimation of the posterior, we have used NUTS sampling as implemented in pyMC3 [16]
using 4000 samples. The estimation was done using using naive to slightly conservative priors
assuming that the change points, τi , can be anywhere in the sequence (with τ2 > τ1 ) and that
the variance, σ, is stable across change points. Note that the half Cauchy prior distribution
has series of beneficial properties [17, 18] including its fat tail which allows for extreme values.
These assumptions were modelled using the following priors:
µi ∼ N (0, 0.5)
σ ∼ Half Cauchy(0.5)
τ1 ∼ Uniform(0, max(Nt ))
τ2 ∼ Uniform(τ1 , max(Nt ))
