Abstract
Forest fires impact on soil, water and biota resources has been widely researched. Although
forest fires profoundly impact the atmosphere and air quality across the ecosystems, much
less research has been developed to examine its impact on the current pandemic. The recent
West Coast forest fire in the United States (US) caused severe environmental and public
health burdens. As of October 21, nearly 8.2 million acres of forest area were burned, and
more than 25 casualties were reported so far. In-situ air pollution data were utilized to
examine the effects of 2020 forest fire on atmosphere and coronavirus (COVID-19)
casualties. The spatial-temporal concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) were collected from August 1 to October 30 for 2020 (fire year) and
2019 (reference year). Both spatial (Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression) and
non-spatial (negative binomial regression) regression analysis was performed to assess the
adverse effects of fire emission on human health. The in-situ data-led measurements showed
that the maximum increases in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations (µg/m3) were clustered
in the West Coastal fire-prone states during the August 1 – October 30 period. The average
concentration (µg/m3) of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 was increased in all
the fire states affected badly by forest fires. The average PM2.5 concentration (µg/m3) over the
period was recorded as 7.9, 6.3, 5.5, and 5.2 for California, Colorado, Oregon, and
Washington in 2019, which was increased up to 24.9, 13.4, 25, and 17 in 2020. Both spatial
and non-spatial regression models exhibited a statistically significant association between fire
emission and COVID-19 incidents. A total of 30 models were developed for analyzing the
spatial non-stationary and local association between the predictor and response factors. All
these spatial models have demonstrated a statistical significant association between fire
emissions and COVID counts. More thorough research is needed to better understand the
complex association between forest fire and human health.

1. Introduction
Forest fire is now becoming an increasing global environmental threat across the
ecosystem and caused severe public health burdens due to the upsurges of smokes and
particulate matter concentration into the lower atmosphere (B. et al., 2011; Bowman and
Johnston, 2005; Fowler, 2003; Goldammer et al., 2008). Amongst the causal factors, the
climate change and associated factors (rising temperature, long dry spell, lack of soil
moisture, the abundance of flammable materials, etc.) have augmented the severity, intensity,
and length of forest fire season and eventually increases the exposure to hazardous air
pollutants in the area under forest fire threats (Aponte et al., 2016; Flannigan et al., 2000;
Mateus and Fernandes, 2014; Meira Castro et al., 2020; Michel Arbez et al., 2001). Forest
fire has been significantly associated with the increases in gaseous, i.e. Carbon (Aragão et al.,
2018; Lazaridis et al., 2008; Lü et al., 2006), Smoke (Fromm and Servranckx, 2003; Johnston
et al., 2014; Mott et al., 2002), black Carbon (Badarinath et al., 2007; Jeong et al., 2004),
aerosol (Pio et al., 2008; Randerson et al., 2006), fine (Ikemori et al., 2015; McLean et al.,
2015; Sapkota et al., 2005), coarse particulate matter (Henderson et al., 2008; Juneng et al.,
2009), Nitrogen oxides (McEachern et al., 2000; Spichtinger et al., 2001), and other
pollutants (NO, O3, VOC) (Cheng et al., 1998). In Greece, forest fire emission was found to
be the most significant contributor to the air pollution problem during the fire occurrence
period (Cheng et al., 1998). Through long and short-range atmospheric transport, forest fire
emissions impacted a large region from its source (Lazaridis et al., 2008). The effects of
forest fire emission on air pollution could be easily detected in rural areas where
3

anthropogenic emission is limited (Cheng et al., 1998). In the rural region of Edmonton
(Canada), the hourly NOx, O3 concentration was recorded 50–150% higher than the seasonal
median values, which can be attributed to the forest fire and resulted in emission (Cheng et
al., 1998). However, the forest fire emitted pollutants can travel thousands of kilometres with
the help of upper atmospheric circulation and exacerbate the problem of local air pollution in
the heavily polluted regions (Sapkota et al., 2005). The deterioration of air quality in
Baltimore city (located nearly 1100 km away from the fire source region) due to 2002
Canadian forest fires has once again proven the fact that forest fire emission is not only
posing threats to the nearby communities, but the same can have substantial public health
impact to the regions located far away from the fire-affected areas (Sapkota et al., 2005).
Several earlier research has utilized many available resources, i.e. satellite estimates
(Konovalov et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2006), in-situ measurement (Konovalov et al., 2011), lowcost sensor measurements (Delp and Singer, 2020; Sayahi et al., 2019), air pollution models
(Watson et al., 2019) to examine the detrimental impact of forest fires on air quality across
the ecosystems. Wu et al. (2006) noted that the concentration of PM10 was increased up to
160 μg/m3 due to the 2003 southern California forest fires and resulted in the emission of
particulate matter. (Hodzic et al., 2007) study on 2003 European forest fires documented a
drastic increase (20 to 200%) of air pollutants, especially PM10, due to the emission of
gaseous compounds during the fire period.

Forest fires were also found to be highly

associated with the increases of fine particulate matter (<

2.5µm)

(Jaffe et al., 2008; Matz et

al., 2020; Sullivan et al., 2008). Though there has been strong and clear evidence that forest
fires have a strong negative impact on air quality, still, there are several other confounding
factors, such as the description of fire emissions, atmospheric dispersion of smoke, and the
chemical transformations of smoke, etc., needs to be evaluated comprehensively in order to

4

understand the association between forest fire and air quality in a better way (Martins et al.,
2012).
Several studies have reported the association between short/long term exposure to air
pollution and incidents of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 - 2019 (SARSCoV-2 – COVID-19) in many regions across the world (Ogen, 2020; Sciomer et al., 2020;
Shen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Amongst the key air pollutants, the
concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and its association with COVID
casualties has been the central focus in these studies. Zhu et al. (2020) study has performed
Generalized Additive Model (GAM) after considering COVID-19 incidences of 120 cities in
China and found that a10 µg/m3 increases PM2.5 and PM10 was associated with a 2.24% and
1.76% increase in daily COVID-19 confirmed cases. Zhu et al. found that per 10 µg/m3
increase of NO2 was associated with a 6.94% increase in daily COVID-19 confirmed cases.
(Yao et al., 2020) study analyzed the linkages between air pollution and COVID incidences
in 49 cities in China using a multiple linear regression model and found that per 10 µg/m3
increase in PM2.5 and PM10 was associated with a 0.24% (0.01% - 0.48%) and 0.26% (0.00%
- 0.51%) increase in the daily COVID-19 fatality rate. (Wu et al., 2020) observation
considered 3000 counties of the USA and performed a zero-inflated negative binomial model
to examine the linkages between the concentration of PM2.5 and COVID death rate during the
January to April 4, 2020 period. They have reported that a 1 µg/m3 long-term exposure
increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 15% increase in COVID-19 death rate. In England,
(Travaglio et al., 2021) study had found a strong association between PM2.5 concentration and
COVID incidents (an increase of 1 µg/m3 in the long-term average of PM2.5 was associated
with a 12% increase in COVID-19 cases).

The unprecedented and record-breaking forest fire events in 2020 in the West Coast states
(California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado) in the USA can cause severe health burdens,
especially at the time of the COVID pandemic. As of October 21, 2020, nearly 8.2 million
acres (33,000 km2) of forest area were burnt, and 46 casualties have been reported so far
(https://www.fire.ca.gov/). The economic cost attributed to these events can be as much as
$2.707 Billion in 2020 unit price. The air quality during the fire periods has become
extremely poor and reached very unhealthy to hazardous level in many fire-affected regions.
Though the air quality has improved in some parts of the area due to lockdown measures, it
still remains hazardous in the areas poorly affected by the forest fire. Since it has been proven
that forest fire contributes substantially in adding gaseous and particulate matter
concentration into the lower and upper atmosphere, the coexistence of two extreme events,
i.e. the 2020 forest fire, which has declared as the most intense forest fire in the USA since
2003, and COVID-19 pandemic, which is also announced as one of the worst pandemics in
the history of human civilization, has not been discussed thoroughly. Therefore, the
synergistic association between these two rare events (West Coast forest fire and COVID
casualties) and their combined effects on human health should be examined so that the same
would allow us to understand how climate change led extremities can exacerbate the crisis of
public health. The objectives of this are: (1) examine the air quality levels during the fire
period (August 01 to October 30) in fire year (2020) and reference year (2019), (2) measures
the changes in air quality due to forest fire; (3) analzying the association between fire
emission and COVID incidences using spatial regression models.

2.1 Data source and processing
6

The Western states of the USA, mainly California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho,
Colorado, have witnessed the record-breaking (surpassed the last 18 years fire severity
records in terms of forest area burnt and damages of property and structures) forest fires that
started early in August 2020. As of Mid October 2020, 8.2 million acres (33,000 square
kilometres) were burned, and at least 46 casualties have been reported so far (National
Interagency Fire Center). Many factors, including climate change, led to an extremely higher
temperature, lack of surface moisture due to below-normal precipitation in the preceding
seasons, extended dry spell and associated heat waves, higher wind speed, abundant fuel
load, etc. have exacerbated the severity and length of the forest fires in these regions (Balch
et al., 2017; Collins et al., 2019; Kane et al., 2017).
In-situ air pollution measurements were retrieved from OpenAQ1. OpenAQ is a nonprofit organization aiming to retrieve, harmonize, share open-air quality information to
citizens and organizations, and provide an up-to-date status of clean air, which would
eventually help prevent air pollution led health burdens across the world. The OpenAQ
platform retrieved the latest and up-to-date air quality data from multiple sources such as
government/institution air quality monitoring stations and low-cost open-air quality sensors.
All the data were collected from August 1 to October 30 period for comparative assessment
and subsequent interpretation.
Daily COVID-19 cases and death data were collected from USAFacts2. The
USAFacts collects COVID counts data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), State and local-level public health agencies. The county-level data for each States
collects and verified with the local and State agencies. The daily cumulative sum of deaths
and cases reports for each administrative units were recorded through manual entry or web

scraping (USAFacts, 2020). For California and Texas, USAFacts gather COVID data from
each county’s public health website. Currently, the presumptive positive cases considered as
confirmed cases, which is in line with CDC’s COVID reporting. Daily and cumulative sum
counts of cases and deaths were analyzed to find its association with forest fire emissions.
More details about the COVID data collection process, quality assurance, data collection
assumptions, flag detection and reporting, etc., can be found on the USAFacts website.
The fire emission was measured for the study region using Global Fire Emission
Database Explorer v4.1 (GFEDv4s3) (Akagi et al., 2011; Andreae and Merlet, 2001; Giglio et
al., 2013; Randerson et al., 2012; van der Werf et al., 2017, 2017). Time series GFED data
was incorporated into the assessment to estimate particulate matter and greenhouse gas
emissions from forest fires. GFED data has contained 1440 columns and 720 rows with 0.25°
spatial resolution and available from 1997 to the current date. In this study, GFED estimates
were utilized for the 1997 – 2020 period. GFED emission data comes with a three-time scale,
i.e. annual emissions, monthly emission, and daily emission of gaseous and particulate matter
components. Each raster layer consists of three main datasets: the spatial extent of the burned
area, monthly emissions and fractional contributions of different fire types, and daily / 3hourly emission records at a specified spatial scale. Since the earlier version of the GFED has
not considered the small fire details, the present study utilized the most updated GFED4.1s
(with small fire) statistics for analysis and subsequent interpretation. Both emissions and
burned area information were used to calculate fire-led emission for the 1997 to 2020 period.
Fires that have been recorded over varied landscapes also considered for the analysis.
GFED4.1s offers detailed statistics of LULC specific small fire information. Among the
regions, fire emissions data for the Temperate North America (TENA) regions were
considered for this analysis.

2.2 Regression analysis
2.2.1 Non-spatial regression model
Two regression models, i.e. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Negative Binomial
Regression was performed to examine the association between forest fire emission and
COVID incidences at the county scale. For regression analysis, only fire States were
considered. OLS measures the interaction and association between the sets of dependent and
independent factors (Maiti et al., 2021; Mollalo et al., 2020; Oshan et al., 2019; Sannigrahi et
al., 2020b, 2020a). Additionally, OLS fits a line based on the characteristics of the dependent
and independent observations in the bivariate data framework to minimize the squared
distance of each data points from the fitted line (Kilmer and Rodríguez, 2017; Sokal et al.,
1995). The OLS can be formed as follows

yi = a +  xi +  i

(1)

Where a is the intercept,  vector of regression coefficients, xi is the vector of selected air
pollutants at county i,  i is the error term.
In addition to the standard OLS estimates, the negative binomial (NB) regression
method was also applied for analyzing the association between forest fire emission and
associated COVID case/death counts during the fire period (Copat et al., 2020; Wu et al.,
2020). The NB regression model was used in the present research to minimize overdispersion
in statistical estimates. Among the several link function, the log has been used as a link
function to carry out the NB regression analysis. The NB regression with Poisson parameter
can be expressed as follows:

9

n (i ) =  0 +  k =1  k X ik + i
p

(2)

Where the Poisson parameter ( i ) represents the expected estimates of observation i,  0 ,

 k are the model input parameters, X ik is the kth number of the independent variable for
observation i, i is the gamma-distributed error (e) term with mean and variance considered
as 1 and α (Chang, 2005; Wang et al., 2021).

2.2.2 Spatial regression model
In the present study, a modified version of Geographically weighted regression
(GWR) – MGWR, developed by Oshan et al. (2019), has been used for exploring the
spatially varying association between the fire emission and COVID counts at county scale in
the contiguous US. The GWR is a local spatial regression approach conceptualized upon the
assumption of spatial heterogeneity and spatial non-stationarity among the parameters in a
feature space. Unlike global regression, which assumes a spatial homogeneity and constant
relationship among the features, the GWR often increases the model fit by reducing residuals
of spatial autocorrelation in parameter estimates. GWR is also sensitive to bandwidth and
kernel selection and parametrization, which seeks special attention while designing the spatial
models to explain any spatial varying relationship between parameters.
Recently, an extension to the existing GWR frameworks known as multiscale GWR
(MGWR) allows exploring the locally varying association between the parameters at a unique
spatial scale which eventually helps to understand the multiscale analysis of spatial
heterogeneity and spatial non-stationarity. MGWR that eliminates the assumption and
limitation of the existing GWR that all spatial association vary uniformly at all spatial scale
10

could reduce the model overfitting, spatial auto-correlation and uncertainty that mainly
originates from the scale-dependent approximation of parameters. In the present study, the
MGWR model incorporated into the spatial analysis framework to explore the spatial
association between forest fire emission and COVID counts at the lowest spatial in the
contiguous USA. The mgwr python package, which has many dependencies, such as NumPy,
SciPy, pandas, matplotlib, libpysal, and spglm, was used to run the MGWR model. A
standard GWR model can be expressed as:


yi =  i 0 +   ik xik +  i
k =1

(3)

Where yi is the dependent variable (COVID case/death in this study) for location i, i 0 is the
intercept coefficient of location i, ik is the local regression coefficient of k th explanatory
variable at location i, xik is the kth independent variable at location i,  i is the random error
term at location i.
In the MGWR model, the scale or bandwidth dependent spatial assumption in the GWR
model has been respecified by incorporating scale variant association between the parameters
in feature space as follows:
k

y =  f j + i
j =1

Where

fj

(4)

is the smoothing function introduced in MGWR model, which applied to the jth

independent variable and allowed to explore the association at distinct spatial
scale/bandwidth.

2.3 Experimental Design
Different approaches have been adopted in each segment of the analysis, which
collectively demonstrates how forest fire emission can cause severe real-time and lagged
impact on the atmosphere and public health. The entire analysis was performed through many
successive steps: first, the fire affected States, i.e. California, Oregon, Washington, and
Colorado, were demarcated based on the number of active fire events statistics and National
Fire Emergency Report. These States have been grouped together and named as fire States
(short name used as FireStates). The remaining States assumed to have fewer fire effects
have been marked as ExFireStates (Excluding fire States). Accordingly, the air pollution
assessment was performed for the (a) fire States (FireSates), (b) ExFireStates, and (c) all
States (considered both FireStates and ExFireStates), from August 1 to October 30 in both
reference year (2019) and fire year (2020). 2019 was chosen as a reference year as this year
has comparably lower active fire events than the preceding years. Moreover, OpenAQ air
pollution data is available from 2018; this could be another reason for choosing 2019 as a
reference year and 2020 as a fire year. 2018 has not been considered in the analysis as there
had been high fire events recorded across the Western States of the USA, especially in
California and surrounding regions (Enders et al., 2021). Since the first forest fire incident
occurred sometime in the last week of July and the first week of August, August 1 has been
considered the starting date for the analysis. Second: the active fire events and their geocoded information were extracted from Soumi-NPP and NOAA-20 fire products from August
1 to October 30. Other auxiliary information such as FRP, brightness temperature, etc., has
also been retrieved from the source data. Instead of taking the weekly period, daily active fire
events data was utilized for generating FRP hotspots over the space using the kernel density
method. Third: sensor location information for PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 was retrieved from the
OpenAQ data platform. Stations with no data (or have irregular data such as missing values
12

or very high/low observation) were discarded from the analysis. Using the approach stated
above, a total number of 274, 70 and 61 ground air pollution monitoring stations have been
identified for PM2.5, PM10, and NO2. For few monitoring stations, data was found irregular or
not available for either year. These stations have also been removed from the final evaluation.
The default unit (ppm) of NO2 was converted to µg/m3 unit to make it comparable with other
pollutants. Fourth: The mapping of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 was done in two different ways. In
the first step, the state-wise average PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration were measured
using the spatial join function in ArcGIS Pro software. The State-wise average concentration
of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 in the reference year (2019) was provided in supplementary tables.
Before putting the pollution estimates into the analysis for spatial mapping and subsequent
interpretation, data was checked thoroughly for eliminating outliers and irregular
measurements. In the second step, the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) kriging was
performed using the station's pollution measurements and accordingly, a continuous raster
surface was prepared for both fire year and reference year. Fifth: The daily concentration of
PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 in the FireStates and ExFireStates from August 1 to October 30 was
also incorporated in the assessment to examine the impact of forest fire on air quality of the
regions and to assess statistical significant changes in air pollution concentration during the
fire period. The distribution and ranges of the air pollution concentration were measured
using minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum distributions of
parameters. Linear trend analysis was also performed for assessing the changes in PM2.5,
PM10, and NO2 concentration during the study period. Linear trend fit and statistical
significance of the change estimates were also measured at different probability levels for the
defined period for both 2019 and 2020. Daily PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 values have been used
for the linear trend assessment. Daily COVID-19 cases and deaths counts have also been
incorporated into the change assessment analysis to examine the association between air
13

pollution concentration and COVID incidents in the fire-prone States of the USA. All the
statistical analysis was performed in R statistical software. Multiscale Geographically
Weighted Regression (MGWR) was done using the MGWR Python package and MGWRv4
software.

3. Results
3.1 Forest fire emission and its impact on air pollution
The spatial-temporal changes and variation of different air pollutants, i.e. PM2.5,
PM10, and NO2, were measured using in-situ monitored air pollution data collected from
OpenAQ controlled stations. Fig S1 shows the spatial location and distribution of PM2.5,
PM10, and NO2 ground monitoring stations. Using the spatially distributed monitoring data,
the raster map of different air pollutants have been prepared (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. S2,
Fig. S3). A drastic change and upsurges of air pollution concentration (µg/m3) are evident in
the Western part of the USA that mainly caused by the 2020 West Coast forest fire events.
The maximum PM2.5 (µg/m3) concentration is recorded as ~80, ~250, and ~160 in August,
September, and October in 2020, while the same was recorded much lower in concentration,
i.e. ~25, ~65, ~45 during the same period in 2019 (Fig. 2). A similar changing pattern is
observed for PM10 and NO2 concentration during the study period (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). PM10
concentration (µg/m3) is reached up to ~260 in 2020 in the Western states of the USA. In
contrast, the concentration of PM10 is recorded as much lower in 2019. In addition to the
raster based-analysis, the State averaged pollution concentration (µg/m3) is also measured for
both 2019 and 2020 (Fig. S2). In order to save space, only 2020’s map has been given in this
paper. The state-averaged concertation values of different air pollutants are found comparably
higher in the Western states than the rest of the states of the USA. Moreover, the state14

averaged change statistics also suggesting a noticeable percentage increases in PM2.5, PM10,
and NO2 concentration during the study period. Among the pollutants, the changes are
measured highest for PM2.5, followed by PM10, and NO2, respectively (Fig. S3 and Fig. S4).
Additionally, a high percentage of increases are observed in the fire-affected States, i.e.
California, Colorado, Washington, Nebraska, etc. (Fig. S4). While the other States have
shown a negligible to negative (air quality index increases in 2020 due to full/partial COVID
lockdown in most of the States) changes in air pollution concentration (µg/m3) during August
1 to October 31 period in non-fire (2019) and fire year (2020).
The temporal changes in air pollution concentration during the August 1 to October
30 period is evaluated for both 2019 and 2020 and presented in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8,
Table. 1, Table. S1, Table. S2, Table. S3, Table. S4, Table. S5, Table. S6. Fig. 5 and
Table. S1 shows the monthly averaged concentration (µg/m3) of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 in
August, September, and October months. Only fire states (California, Oregon, Washington,
and Colorado) were considered for calculating the monthly statistical distribution of air
pollutants in 2019 and 2020. Monthly averaged PM2.5 concentration (µg/m3) in 2019 was
measured as 7.41, 6.79, 5.49, and 5.96 for California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington,
while the same was measured as 20.95, 14.50, 6.46, and 5.09 in 2020, respectively (Table.
S1 and Fig. 5). For PM10, the monthly averaged values (µg/m3) were increased in the fire
affected states (Table. S1). However, for NO2, a decreasing monthly averaged concentration
(µg/m3) was observed during the study period (Fig. 6 and Table. S1). Changes in air
pollution concentration due to forest fire are also examined and presented in Fig. 6, Fig. 7,
Table. 1, and Table. S2. During the entire study period (August 1 to October 30), changes in
PM2.5 was measured highest for Oregon, followed by Washington, California, and Colorado,
respectively (Table. S2). For PM10, the changes (positive) were highest in Washington, while
the same measured comparably low in California and Colorado states (Table. S2). Among
15

the three air pollutants, changes in percentage concentration were found lowest for NO2, as
many States have shown the declining status of NO2 concentration in 2020 (Table. S2). This
happened due to the partial/fully lockdown imposed in many states due to the outbreak of
COVID in 2020. In addition to this, the State-wise monthly averaged concentration of PM2.5,
PM10, and NO2 is also measured and presented in Fig. 6, Table. S3, Table. S4, Table. S5.
These tables and Figures collectively suggest that PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations were
increased in 2020, mainly due to the record-breaking forest fires in the West Coast regions of
the contiguous US in 2020. A linear trend curve is also fitted for three air pollutants for both
2019 and 2020 to examine the changes in daily PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration during
the study period. The daily averaged linear fit surface measured for both 2019 and 2020 was
found significantly high in 2020 than that of 2019. Additionally, the peak PM2.5 and PM10
concentration (µg/m3) have reached up to ~100 (for PM2.5) and 200 (for PM10), whereas the
daily concentration of the pollutants was measured much lower in 2019, reached maximum
up to 25 (for PM2.5) and 150 (for PM10), respectively (Fig. 7). Statistical non-parametric test
has been done to examine the mean difference in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration
between fire (2020) and reference (2019) year and presented in Table. 1. The mean
differences of all three air pollutants, i.e. PM2.5 (reported as model 1, 4, 7), PM10 (model 2, 5,
8) and NO2 (model 3, 6, 9) between fire and the non-fire year was found statistically
significant at significance level P<0.05 (Table. 1). In continuation to the comparison analysis
between the air pollution concentration in fire and non-fire years, the monthly averaged air
quality index (AQI) is also computed using EPA’s defined AQI threshold values. AQI has
been found to deteriorate in 2020 in California, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Wahington, etc.
(Table. S6). These States have been affected badly by the 2020 forest fire, and a considerable
amount of forest area (acres) has been lost that resulted in adding a substantial amount of fine
and coarse particulate matter into the atmosphere. The added concentration of PM2.5, PM10,
16

and NO2 that has been observed in this study could be entirely due to forest fire emission, as
most the States and large cities in the contiguous USA undergone strict lockdown in 2020 to
prevent the spread of COVID-19, which means the contribution of anthropogenic emission
that comes from traffic and industry is halted and therefore the same has negligible
contribution to the increases of air pollution concentration in 2020.
To analyze the national scale air pollution status in the entire USA during 2000 to
2019 and to compare the trend of changes during 2000 – 2019 period with 2020 forest fire
emission status, the linear trend plots have been drawn for both the key air pollutants (PM2.5,
PM10, and NO2) (Fig. S5), as well as for the fire determinant climatic variables, i.e. average
precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, etc. (Fig. S6). Fig. S5 shows the linear
temporal changes in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration in the entire USA (Fig. S6a),
Western region (Fig. S6b), and South Western region (Fig. S6c), respectively. PM2.5
concentration has been reduced significantly during the 2000 – 2019 period for all three
regions. However, since the Western part of the USA have frequently received large scale
forest fires periodically, the changes in PM2.5 concentration during 2000 - 2019 was found
much lower in the Western region (R2 = 0.72), while the same was measured comparably
higher at the National level (R2 = 0.96) and South Western region (R2 = 0.86), respectively
(Fig. S5). For PM10, the changes were measured much higher (R2 = 0.71) at the national
level, calculated as 104 (µg/m3) in 2000 and 56 (µg/m3) in 2019 than that of the Western
region (R2 = 0.63). However, simultaneously, the changes in PM10 concentration during 2000
– 2019 were found insignificant in the South Western region (Fig. S5). Additionally, NO2
concentration during 2000 – 2019 has been reduced significantly, found maximum changes
for the national level (R2 = 0.97), followed by Western (R2 = 0.95), and South Western region
(0.91), respectively (Fig. S5). The increasing pattern of both mean and maximum temperature
might have augmented the impact of forest fire in the West Coast region of the USA (Fig.
17

S6). Loess filter has been used to smoothen the data collected for the period 1895 – 2020 for
all three climatic variables. In addition to the temperature variables, average precipitation has
also been increased during the 1895 – 2020 period (Fig. S6, Table. S7). Apart from the key
air pollutants, the emission of other pollutants was estimated using the GFED. V4.1 database
(Table. S8, S9). Among the major biomes, only all fires and temperature biome fires were
considered for effective comparison analysis. Due to the massive forest fire events in 2020,
the emission of Carbon, Black Carbon, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, Nitrous Oxide,
Nitrogen Oxide, Particulate Matter, Sulphur dioxide, Total Particulate Matter, and Carbon
from total particulate matter was increased substantially, and the measured values were found
much higher in 2020 compared to the 1997 – 2019 period (Table. S8). The year-wise
summary values of different air pollutants were also measured and presented in Table. S9.
Emission of different air pollutants was measured comparably very high in 2020 than the
preceding years (Table. S9). The number of large forest fire events and associated emission
of Carbon and fine particulate matters could be the main reason for these exceptionally high
emission estimates that were evident in the Western part of the USA in mid to late 2020.
3.2 Forest fire led emission and its association with COVID counts
Fig. 8 shows how COVID new cases/death counts and the concentration of PM2.5,
PM10, and NO2 have changed on a daily scale during the study period. For California and
Colorado, a synergistic association between the daily PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration
and COVID numbers are observed. For the remaining two States, i.e. Oregon and
Washington, no such close association between the fire emission and COVID counts have
observed (Fig. 8). To further extend the correlation analysis, a correlation matrix has been
drawn consisting of month-wise distribution of air pollution estimates and COVID counts in
the fire States (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). Fig. 9 was illustrated using the COVID and air pollution
18

values individually for each of the four fire States, and Fig. 10 was plotted based on the
averaged values of COVID counts and PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration of the four fire
States. COVID cases and death were statistically significantly correlated with PM2.5 October,
PM10 October, NO2 September and NO2 October estimates (Fig. 9). However, considering
the average COVID-19 numbers and air pollution values of the four fire States, a moderate
association between the COVID counts and air pollution was found for all three months
considered in this study (Fig. 10, Table. 2).
The outcomes of the spatial regression analysis between the averaged (average of
three months, i.e. August, September, October) air pollution values and COVID-19 counts
are presented in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12. For all the test case experiments between COVID
counts and air pollution estimates, comparably high spatial R2 values are measured for the
State of Colorado and California counties. In contrast, lower spatial R2 values are measured
for the counties in Washington and Oregon (Fig. 11 and Table. 3). This implies a spatial
non-stationary and localized association between the explanatory (air pollution in the present
study) and response variables (COVID case and deaths) which can not be explained through a
global stationary regression model. A similar pattern of association was found between the
county averaged maximum PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations and COVID-19 counts (Fig.
12 and Table. 4). For the month-wise analysis, a total of 18 spatial models were developed
that covered both COVID cases and death and accompanied with relevant model diagnostics
tests, including AIC, BIC, adjusted t-test, to assess the statistical significance of the models at
different probability level and uncertainty estimates that are associated with different model
parametrization (Table. 3). To capture the overall local association between the explanatory
and response variables for the entire study period (August 1 to October 30), a total of 12
spatial regression models were developed by considering the averaged values of the COVID19 and air pollution estimates (both averaged and maximum values were considered) of the
19

studied fire States (Table. 4). Among the models, the highest local R2 are measured for
NO2max (R2 = 0.542 for cases and R2 = 0.556 for death) and NO2mean (R2 = 0.409 for cases
and R2 = 0.443 for death) (Table. 4). In addition to the spatial regression, the negative
binomial regression is also performed to examine the effect of dispersion into the modelling
outcomes (Table. S10 for COVID-19 case and Table. S11 for COVID-19 death). A total of
two NB models were performed to examine the association between the explanatory and
response variable with adjusted dispersion effects on the model. For both the models, the α or
the estimate of dispersion parameter are found greater than 0, which implies the presence of
overdispersion in the data. The positive coefficient values suggest that one unit increases of
the predictor variable lead to x unit change in the expected outcome of the response variable.
Among the model combinations, the positive coefficients values were found between the
PM2.5max, PM10mean, and NO2max with COVID19 cases Table. S10, S11. These suggest
that one unit changes in PM2.5max, PM10mean, and NO2max would increase the COVID-19
cases by 0.014, 0.078, and 0.251 units, respectively. While for the death factor, the
coefficient values are measured as 0.085 and 0.260 for PM10mean and NO2max (Table. S10,
S11).

Discussion
The drastic increases of air pollutants in the mid to late 2020 in the West Coast States
of the US indicates that the fires in 2020 not only caused severe impact on wildlife and
structural damages of properties, but they also added high amounts of gaseous and particulate
pollutants including smoke and ash into the atmosphere, raising health emergency amidst the
COVID-19 pandemic period. Though the clear connection between health effects and forest
fire smoke has not fully explored, there are substantial evidence that supports the strong
20

association between fire emitted smoke and ash concentration and severe health outcomes.
Research has also observed that such effects have often exhibited delayed/lagged
consequences, especially for cardiovascular and respiratory cause-specific diseases, and do
not usually disappear when air gets clear (Landguth et al., 2020). Due to forest fire and the
associated emission of particulate matter, a positive trend in PM2.5 and PM10 concentration
was observed in the North West and Western United States (the most fire-prone region in the
USA), compared to the other areas of the country for which a negative trend in PM2.5 was
recorded during the study period. This positive trend in PM2.5 concentration was mainly
associated with forest fire, black carbon emission and emission of smoke in the West Coast
region. The forest fire smoke emission above the boundary layer is often elevated into the
free troposphere through convective lofting where the highspeed winds help travel the smoke
to a long distance. The subsidence of this smoke layer occurs at the zone of high surface
pressure, which can contribute to the enhancement of surface concentration of fine particulate
matter (Miller et al., 2011).
There are many factors responsible for recurring forest fire events in the USA's West
Coast region. The current year has witnessed the above-normal heatwave (~54 °C
temperature recorded in some places in California in 2020), which triggered and created the
ideal condition for ignition's, which eventually led to massive forest fires. On the other hand,
the cold breezes from neighbouring states, Colorado, have supplied the winds that helped
grow the blazes across the region. In line with the previous studies, the present analyses
found a comparatively higher forest fire activity, mostly over Western regions of the US,
followed by a significantly uplifting PM concentration. At the same time, other parts of the
country exhibited a substantially lower concentration of atmospheric pollutants due to the
strict practice of lockdown. Additionally, despite being located in the Coastal region where
local wind breeze often subdues the high pollution concentration, the Western Coastal states
21

of the USA exhibited high spikes of particulate matter and NO2 concentrations amidst the
COVID lockdown period when the anthropogenic emission is partially or entirely switchedoff.

The unprecedented and abrupt increase of fine and coarse particulate matter in 2020
has mainly happened due to the forest fire emission. This added concentration in PM2.5 and
PM10 could pose serious health concerns to the residents living in this region. Forest fire
smoke causes 339,000 annual global premature mortality (interquartile range: 260,000–
600,000) (Johnston et al., 2012). An earlier study that analyzed 61 epidemiological studies
linked with a forest fire and human health across the world and reported that daily air
pollution levels recorded during or after forest fire events exceeded US EPA regulations (Liu
et al., 2015). In many cases, the average PM10 concentration during the forest fire period was
found 1.2 to 10 times higher than that of non-fire periods (Liu et al., 2015). Among the
diseases primarily attributed to forest fire, the respiratory disease was highly associated with
forest fire smoke concentration (Liu et al., 2015). In the USA, nearly 10% of the population
(30.5 million) stayed in the regions where the contribution of forest fire to annual average
ambient PM2.5 was high (>1.5 μg/m3). Nearly 10.3 million people experienced unhealthy air
quality for more than 10 consecutive days attributed to forest fire and resulted in emissions
(Rappold et al., 2017). People with the existing respiratory illness have found to be more
susceptible to forest fire air pollution effects, and the upsurges of the demand for rescue
medication have been linked to the average exposure time to forest fire smoke in Southern
California, USA (Vora et al., 2011). Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) has also been linked to
forest fire emission (particularly PM10 emission) as an elevated number of IHD related clinic
visits were reported during the forest fire seasons in California (Lee et al., 2009).

22

The statistically significant association between the fire emitted particulate matter and
COVID numbers measured from both spatial and non-spatial regression models indicated the
strong impact of forest fire and resulted in emission of air pollutants on human health. Since
the West Coast forest fire has begun in the mid to late 2020, this gives us a once in a century
opportunity to carefully examines the close connection between the two extreme events, i.e.
record-breaking forest fire in 2020 and the associated emission of air pollutants and its effects
on COVID-19 casualties. Since several studies have already established the fact that high
concentration of air pollutants, especially PM2.5, PM10, and NO2, can exacerbate the spread
and overall casualties of COVID-19 across the scale, it is expected that the added amount of
particulate matter and NO2 concentration will have a significant impact on the overall
COVID scenarios of the country. A table has been prepared that summarizes previous
research findings and shows how different air pollutants have affected COVID spread and
overall casualties caused by COVID-19. Among the studies, Wu et al. (2020) analyzed
COVID data from 3,000 counties in the USA and found that the increases in 1 µg/m3 PM2.5
were associated with increased COVID case by about 15% (Table. 5). The results of the
negative binomial regression of the present study have also indicated a similar association
between the predictors and response variables. This study found that both average and
maximum concentration of the key air pollutants are highly associated with the COVID cases
and deaths in the fire States considered in this study. More detailed analysis with updated
COVID-19 data and air pollution measurements will allow us to explore the actual and
lagged impact of the 2020 forest fires on both the atmosphere and COVID casualties.

Conclusion

23

The present research has evaluated the effects of forest fire on air quality and COVID-19
casualties in the West Coast states (California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington) in the
USA. In 2020, the West Coast forest fires broke the past forest fire records, and nearly 8
million acres forest areas were burned in California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington
states in the USA. To understand the adverse effects of forest fire emissions on air quality,
the concentrations of different air pollutants, i.e. PM2.5, PM10, and NO2, were measured using
in-situ monitored data for a fixed period (August 1 to October 30) for 2020 (fire year) and
2019 (reference year). Additionally, both spatial and non-spatial regression analysis is
performed using the county scale COVID-19 and air pollution data to better understand the
adverse effects of fire emission on human health. The concentration of particulate matter and
NO2 increased from three to five times during the fire period in 2020. The abundance of dry
fuel load and increasing surface and air temperature has portrayed the potential risk of large
scale fire events in the Western region of the USA. Due to the unprecedented forest fire and
particulate matter, and gaseous emissions, the average level of exposure to hazardous
pollutants has been increased significantly. This may cause severe health hazards if the fire
smoke persists over an extended period. The high-intensity fire events in West Coast regions
have been triggered by many causal factors, including heatwaves and a warming climate, the
abundant load of dry fuel and lack of soil moisture, cold breezes from nearby states and the
occurrence of hurricanes amid the fire events. The increased level of air pollution caused by
the West Coast forest fire in 2020 revealed a statistically significant positive association with
the COVID-19 casualties. This suggest that forest fire and resulted in gaseous and particulate
matter emission could play a major role if the same occurs together with an pandemic or
epidemic situation.

found new threshold levels of PM10 for
COVID-19: 29.6 μg/m3 (PM10) for Paris, 20.6
μg/m3 (PM10) for Lyon;22.04 μg/m3 (PM10) for
Marseille. In the city of Paris, an increase in
PM10 concentration beyond the 29.6 μg/m3
threshold could generate a 63.2% increase in
mortality (in a COVID-19 pandemic). For
Lyon, any value above 20.6 μg/m3 in PM10
would generate an increase in deaths of
56.12%.
Pearson r = 0.79 (last four weeks of the partial
lockdown) and 0.69 ( twelve weeks of the
partial lockdown) with total COVID-19
confirmed cases.
