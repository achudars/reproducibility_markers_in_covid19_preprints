Abstract
We propose an epidemiological model that includes the mobility patterns
of the individuals, in the spirit to those considered in Refs. [1–3]. We assume
that people move around in a city of 120×120 blocks with 300 inhabitants
in each block. The mobility pattern is associated to a complex network in
which nodes represent blocks while the links represent the traveling path of
the individuals (see below). We implemented three confinement strategies
in order to mitigate the disease spreading: 1) global confinement, 2) partial
restriction to mobility, and 3) localized confinement. In the first case, it was
observed that a global isolation policy prevents the massive outbreak of the
disease. In the second case, a partial restriction to mobility could lead to
a massive contagion if this was not complemented with sanitary measures
such as the use of masks and social distancing. Finally, a local isolation
policy was proposed, conditioned to the health status of each block. It was
observed that this mitigation strategy was able to contain and even reduce
the outbreak of the disease by intervening in specific regions of the city
according to their level of contagion. It was also observed that this strategy
is capable of controlling the epidemic in the case that a certain proportion
of those infected are asymptomatic.

1. Introduction
In the absence of a vaccine, strategies based on non-pharmaceutical interventions were proposed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing policies, specifically mobility restrictions and lockdowns, among others
were the more common ones. Such policies should be implemented for long
periods (typically months) to avoid re-emergence of the epidemic once lifted.
Therefore, quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of nonpharmaceutical interventions and their timings.
Many works analyze real-time mobility data in order to relate the changes
in the mobility patterns and the disease propagation. Ref. [4] reports a correlation between the mobility pattern and the reduction of new infections.
Besides, they found that it takes two to three weeks to see results due to the
incubation time of the disease. Also, Ref. [5] carries out a detailed study of
the effects of containment measures during the first 50 days of the COVID-19
epidemic in China. These researchers found that traveling restrictions and
social distancing measures (among others) were effective in the containment
of the disease. Ref. [6] analyzes real mobility datasets in many US metropolitan areas. They found that a small minority of “super-spreaders” places are
the responsible for the wide propagation of the infection.
The changes in the mobility patterns are a consequence of the implementation of different quarantines. Ref. [7] analyzes different quarantine types
considering a complex SEIR scheme. They suggested an alternative type of
quarantine to reduce the infection disease while allowing a socio-economic
activity. In a similar way, Ref. [8] proposes a cyclic schedule of 4-days work
and 10-days lockdown. Also, an improved version of this strategy can be
found in Ref. [9]. The influence of human behaviors on infectious disease
transmission [10], the effects of vaccination during a pandemic [11] and the
role of the “super-spreaders” [12, 13] are many other complex scenarios analyzed in the literature. However, a compressive and quantitative comparison
of the effectivenesses of different lockdown and their timing appears to be
lacking.
In this work we consider the spread of a disease mimicking the COVID19, assuming a spatio-temporal SEIR model of mobile agents. We simulated
and compared different confinement strategies in order to mitigate the disease

propagation. In Section 2 we describe the characteristics of the epidemiological model and the different mitigation strategies. Section 3 details the
simulation procedure. Section 4 displays the results of our investigation,
while Section 5 is dedicated to the discussion of the main results. The conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

2. The epidemiological model
There are three main ingredients in the description of the COVID-19
contagion and spatial spreading: the scenario where the process takes place
(Section 2.1), the mobility patterns of the individuals (Section 2.2) and the
epidemiological dynamics of the individuals (Section 2.3).

2.1. The stage
City
The simulation of the evolution of COVID-19 is performed in a schematic
city in which the basic unit is the block. The city is represented by an homogeneous urban area of 120 × 120 blocks placed in a square grid. The size
of each block is 100 m×100 m. The simulated grid corresponds to a big city,
like Buenos Aires, Argentina. Each block hosts 300 people but this quantity
may vary during the day (see next Section). The total population of the
simulated city is 4.32 M similar to the Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires’
population.

Network construction
The human mobility pattern between the blocks is accomplished by building a weighted and directed network. The nodes represent the blocks, while
the links represent the human mobility from one block to another one. We
consider two different links: short and long links.
Each node is linked with its first neighbors by a short link, as we illustrate in Fig. 1a. They represent the human mobility pattern between all
neighboring blocks. Notice that these links generate a connected graph. As
we will see later, this characteristic of the network will allow the disease to

3

reach all parts of the city (as long as it is not locked during the epidemic).
On the other side, recent investigation on human mobility shows that the
traveling lengths of the individuals follows a Levy distribution given by [14]
P (r) ∝ (r + r0 )−β

(1)

where P (r) stands for the probability that an individual reaches a distance
r, and r0 = 100 m and β = 1.75 correspond to empirical parameters.

(a) Network with only short links

(b) Network with only long links

Figure 1:
Schematic representation of a city network. The city is composed by
120 × 120 blocks placed on a square grid. They are linked by (a) four short links
connecting neighboring nodes and (b) long links connecting far away nodes (see text for
more details). The city corresponds to the union of these two sub-networks.

We built a network of long links following the Levy mobility pattern. This
network is illustrated in Fig. 1b. The procedure was as follows
1. We randomly chose a node.
2. We then select randomly (according to the Levy distribution) the length
r of the next link.
3. We link the node from step 1 to any (random) node located at the
distance r in any direction.
Notice that each node may have more than one long link. Recall that these
links are complementary to the short links connecting neighboring blocks
(say, four neighbors per block).

The total number of long links will depend on how many times we repeat
the above steps. Thus, we looped these steps until the geodesic path of the
network resembled the one expected for a “small world” network [1]. As a
general rule, we found that this condition was fulfilled after 25% of the nodes
had at least one long link. Table 1 summarizes the final set of parameter.
Finally, we stress the fact that the links between different blocks are assigned at the beginning of the simulation. Thereafter, the links remain fixed
until the end of the simulation.

2.2. Mobility pattern
We follow a similar scheme as in Ref. [1, 2] for the individuals’ mobility.
This means that we divide the population of each block into two groups: stationary and non-stationary individuals. The former is composed by infected
individuals while the latter is made up of susceptible, exposed and removed
individuals.
We will assume that stationary individuals stay in their original block. We
will further assume, in the spirit of Ref. [2], that 50% of the non-stationary
stay in their original block, while the other 50% is considered to be mobile during the simulation. In this sense, we assume that 60% of the nonstationary individuals travel (via short links) from their original block to the
neighboring block. And, the remaining 40% travel (via long links) from their
original block to far blocks as indicated in Fig. 2.

Figure 2: Schematic representation of the behavior of the population for a single block.
The population is composed by susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I) and removed (R)
individuals. Infected individuals stay at home during the simulation process while the
50% of the susceptible, exposed and removed individuals move to another blocks (see text
for more details).

Daily displacements of the individuals
Each moving individual is assumed to stay 1/2 of the day in its original
block while the other 1/2 of the day he (she) moves to another block. They
go to his (her) destination (work) everyday, and at the end of the day return
back to their original block (home). This mechanism is performed reversing
the direction of the links between blocks.
Fig. 3 shows a schematic representation of the human mobility pattern
during each day (we illustrate this by a small city of 4×4 blocks for a better
visualization). Recall from the last section that the links represent the mobility pattern between different blocks. Thus, moving humans travel through
the links from one block to another one.

2.3. Epidemiological dynamics of the individuals
In order to describe the time evolution of a given population when a
fraction gets infected, we resort to the SEIR compartmental models. These
models consider that the individuals can be in four successive states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I) and removed (R). Details on each state
can be found in Refs. [1, 2, 9, 15, 16]. The “exposed” state appears whenever
the disease undergoes an “incubation” period, as occurs in the context of the
COVID-19. The “removed” state includes either recovered and dead people.

24 o’clock those humans that traveled from home to work return back to home. At the
end of the day, the population of each block is the same as that in the beginning of the
day. The sequence (a-d) repeats every day until the end of the simulation.

where s(t) = S(t)/N , e(t) = E(t)/N , etc. correspond to the fraction of
people in each state. For the purpose of simplicity, we will consider the coefficients β, σ y γ as fixed parameters. The parameter β (infection rate)
depends on intrinsic ingredients like the infectivity of the virus under consideration and extrinsic ones like the contact frequency. Besides, the parameters
σ and γ depend exclusively on the illness under consideration.
The basic reproduction number R0 is defined at the beginning of the
propagation process as [17]
R0 =

7

β
γ

(3)

This quantity represents the number of individuals that are infected by
the first infected individuals (say, at the beginning of the disease). It is
straight forward that the infection will blossom if R0 is larger than 1. On
the contrary, if this quantity is smaller than 1 the infection vanishes.
Fig. 4 shows the time evolution of either the SEIR model for a single
block and for the whole mobility model (see caption for details). Notice that
the latter shifts the date for the maximum infection to approximately 150.
We will analyze this behavior in more detail in Section 4.

2.1). The plots are normalized with respect to the total population in the city: (a) 300 and
(b) 4.32 M (i.e. 300 individuals per block). In both cases, the disease spreads without any
kind of intervention strategy. The infection rate equals β0 = 0.75 all along the propagation
process. The simulation started with 20 infected individuals located in the single block
(a) and at the central block of the city (b). The rest of the individuals were assumed to
be in the susceptible state.

2.4. Lockdown types
In this section we define the proposed containment strategies which we
have found useful in order to mitigate the disease. We divide the different types of quarantine according to their level of real life implementation
difficulty
• Global lockdown
8

• Imperfect lockdown
• Local lockdown
Global lockdown scenario (GLs)
This type of lockdown consists in the isolation of each block. This means
that people remain in their “home” blocks. We stress the fact that, within
this strategy, society as a whole enters in lockdown. We illustrate this containment action in Fig. 5b.

Imperfect lockdown scenario (IGLs)
As in the previous case, the whole society adopts the same behavior.
But, in this mitigation strategy, we partially reduce the movement between
different blocks. Recall from Section 2.2 that 50% of the non-stationary individuals move from their original block to another one. In this strategy, we
reduce the level of mobility between blocks. Notice that the global quarantine
corresponds to a full reduction of the mobility. We scheme this containment
action in Fig. 5c.

Local lockdown scenario (LLs)
Unlike the other lockdown types, this applies to certain blocks and not to
the whole society. Only those blocks that have a certain number of infected
people are isolated. In this sense, the population of the isolated block are
prohibited to travel around the city. This is achieved in practice by “cutting”
the links to/from the infected blocks. We illustrate this containment action
in Fig. 5d.

3. Numerical simulations
We integrate the SEIR equations by means of the Runge Kutta 4th-order
method. The chosen time step was 0.1 (days). The SEIR equations were updated twice a day (after the people left their homes and after they returned
back (see Figs. 3a and 3c).

Figure 5: (a-d) Schematic representation of different types of mitigation strategies (exemplified by a 4×4 grid). The lines represent the human mobility pattern between blocks. (a)
People are allowed to evolve freely, equivalent to a “continuous activity” scenario. That is,
there is no intervention during the epidemic. (b-d) Before a given day, individuals move
freely from one block to another according to the mobility pattern. After that, (b) all
blocks are isolated, (c) the flow between blocks (represented by red arrows) is reduced but
the mobility pattern is unaffected, (d) those blocks with a number of infected individuals
greater than a certain threshold are isolated (labeled with a red flag). The other blocks
remain linked to each other (labeled with a green flag). See text for more details.

As mentioned in Section 2.3, the parameters σ and γ represent the incubation rate and the recuperation rate, respectively. Therefore, σ −1 and
γ −1 correspond to the mean incubation time and the mean recovery time,
respectively. According to preliminary estimations for COVID-19, we consider the following parameter values for the SEIR model: σ −1 = 3 days and
γ −1 = 4 days [5, 18–21].
Infected individuals remain at their “Home” until evolving into the removed state. Susceptible, exposed and removed individuals are able to move
from one block to another. The simulation started with 20 infected individuals located at the central block of the city, while the rest of the individuals
were assumed to be in the susceptible state.
According to preliminary estimations for COVID-19, the basic reproduction number R0 is (approximately) 3 [5, 22, 23]. This means that the infection
rate β0 is 0.75 (considering γ −1 = 4 days). The implementation of complementary health policies (use of mask, social distancing policies, among others) tends to reduce the contact frequency, and, therefore, the infection rate
(β). Thus, we will also examine situations accomplishing infection rates of a
fraction of β0 .

10

4. Results
We will examine three major scenarios affecting the human mobility:
1. The (global) lockdown scenario assumes that people remain confined
at home until the epidemic is almost over. See details in Section 4.1.
2. The scenario where the confinement recommendation is followed by a
fraction of the city inhabitants. We assume that the traveling individuals move around according to the Levy pattern explained in Section 2.
See further details on this scenario in Section 4.2.
3. Mobility is suppressed only for the inhabitants of “infected blocks”.
That is, common life mobility is sustained between blocks where no
symptoms of the disease appeared. See Section 4.3 for details.
This last scenario is the most cumbersome one since “non-symptomatic”
does not actually mean “non-infected”. We will explicitly introduce a set
of “non-symptomatic” individuals in this scenario, in order to understand
possible flaws to confinement.
4.1. Global lockdown scenario (GLs)
The GLs means that people remain confined within the block where she
(he) lives. It corresponds to a sudden break of the mobility around the city
in the context of our model. We assume, however, that people may still get
in contact within their own block.
In this case, we consider the mobility suppression as the only heath-care
policy. Additional health-care recommendations for the every day living (say,
masks, common rooms disinfections, etc.) are considered in Appendix A.
We will come back to this issue at the end of this Section.
Fig. 6a shows the number of new infected people along time for three
different lockdown periods (see caption for details). It is also shown the evolution for the case of no lockdown at all. The mobility cutoff prevents the
infection curves in Fig. 6a from growing almost immediately after the beginning of the lockdown. The disease, however, disappears (approximately) 50

days (or 7 weeks) after. This is the time it take the susceptible or exposed
individuals in each block to surpass the disease.
Fig. 6b exhibits the number of removed individuals as a function of time
(see caption for details). These correspond to those individuals that previously appear as infected in Fig. 6a. It can be seen that the number of removed
individuals increases since the outbreak of the disease, but it reaches a plateau
soon after the lockdown is established. The plateau level, however, depends
strongly on the starting date of the lockdown. Recall that the disease evolves
only within the infected blocks after the lockdown implementation. Thus,
the earlier the lockdown, the less number of infected (and removed) blocks
at the end of the disease.
We now turn to the city map, in order to get a more accurate picture of
the results so far. Fig. 7 displays the city as a square arrangement of blocks
(see caption for details). Each “pixel” corresponds to a block, and the pixel
color is associated to the corresponding scale on the left, which states the
number of infected and the normalized number of removed per block. The
snapshots capture the disease propagation from a single block located at the
12

center of the map. A complete lockdown occurs at day 100.

The successive snapshots display a seemingly symmetrical propagation
pattern, shortly after the outbreak. However, “secondary” focuses appear
around the main focus due to those long traveling individuals. Recall that
we assumed that human mobility follows a Levy-flight distribution (see Section 2.1).
Notice that the lockdown implementation (from day 100 onwards) somehow “freezes” the picture until the disease disappears (say, 50 days after).
People continue to get infected within each block during the “quaratine” period. Complementary health-care recommendations may be required for the
disease control within each block.
Fig. 8 shows the number of “infected blocks”, regardless of the number
of infected people in the block (see caption for details). These curves quantify the infection map displayed in Fig. 7, and resumes the effects of the full
lockdown.
We may conclude that the GLs appears as a reliable strategy for avoiding the disease propagation. But the main drawback is that “non-infected”
blocks will enter the “quarantine”. Appendix A further shows the effects of
complementary health-care policies.

4.2. The imperfect global scenario (IGLs)
In this case we model a situation in which the GLs cannot be implemented. We distinguish, however, two groups which cannot be kept confined:
workers from essential activities (say, health care, food supply or public order
services, etc.) or those who decide not to accept the confinement recommendation. The former are expected to follow complementary health-care recommendations, while the latter might not. For this reason, we will examine
relaxed confinement conditions and infection rates reduction.

corresponds to the scenario of no lockdown at all. The infection rate remains constant
along the simulation process and equals β0 = 0.75. That is, there is no complementary
health-care policies during the lockdown. The different lockdown implementation days are
indicated by vertical lines.

Fig. 9a shows how the infection curves change as the number of agents
which do not accept the movement restriction increases (see caption for details). The confinement starts at the vertical line. Notice that the propagation stops dramatically for the complete confinement situation. But the
possibility of stopping the outbreak vanishes if a fraction of people (as small
as 20%) still move around. A quick inspection of Fig. 9b confirms this point.
We also notice from Fig. 9b that the total number of removed people at
the end of the lockdown is the same for any IGLs. This appears to be in
disagreement with the stochastic point of view, where the mobility reduction
yields to the reduction in the probability of meeting people. We should remark that the meeting probability is somehow included in the infection rate
β within the SEIR model. Thus, for a complete picture of the IGLs, it is
necessary to explore different values of β, as described below.

of individuals that move around is:
0%,
20% and 50%.
corresponds to the
scenario of no lockdown at all (100% of moving people). We consider a partial break of
the mobility as the only heath-care policy. Thus, the infection rate equals β0 = 0.75 all
along the propagation process.

Fig. 10 examines the number of removed individuals (i.e. agents that
have undergone the complete cycle of the illness, and have either reached a
healthy state or have died) at the end of the epidemic in terms of the complementary health-care policies. Two startup days for the lockdown are shown
(see caption for details). We can see that the number of removed individuals
experiences a dramatic change at β/β0 ≈ 0.5 for the different moving people
situations, regardless of the startup day of the lockdown. This confirms the
necessity of proper policies when these situations are expected to occur.
We improved on the above results by displaying in Fig. 11 the contour
maps for different mobility situations, as a function of the lockdown date.
Notice that Fig. 10 corresponds to date 66 in both contour maps (see caption
in Fig. 10).
Fig. 11 expresses the fact that whenever the human mobility is suppressed,
the number of removed individuals depends (almost exclusively) on the timing of the lockdown implementation. That is, the earlier the lockdown, the
lower the number of removed. Besides, if mobility cannot be suppressed (say,

rate change from β0 = 0.75 to β. The city was composed by 120 × 120 blocks placed on a
square grid with 300 individuals per block.

50% of the people still move around), then complementary health-care policies should be heavily implemented, in order to avoid a massive contagion.
This appears as an essential issue for late lockdowns.
We close this section with the following conclusion: a complete mobility suppression appears as the most effective way of reducing the number of
casualties. Essential workers following strict health-care recommendations
(say, masks, behavioral protocols, etc.) that move around, however, will not
spread the disease to uncontrolled levels. But, a small fraction of people
moving around out of protocol can spoil the mitigation efforts.

4.3. Local lockdown scenario (LLs)
The local lockdown means that people remain confined within the block
where he (she) lives, depending on the infection level of their block. That is,
those blocks surpassing a certain “threshold” of infected people are immediately isolated, while the others remain “open”. As in the case of the GLs,
we assume that people from an isolated block may still get in contact within

blocks as the only heath-care policy. Thus, the infection rate equals β0 = 0.75 all along
the propagation process.

18

The local lockdown relies on the idea that the early detection of the infected can prevent the disease from spreading around the city. This idea
presumes insignificant or null detection flaws. But in practice, a few infected
individuals may not be detected due to wrong testings, or do not present
symptoms at all. Our concern is on these situations. We will assume that a
small fraction of infected people per block cannot actually be detected. This
means that the lockdown occurs after surpassing a “threshold” of infected
people (although not detected).
Fig. 12 represent the usual infection and passed over curves as a function
of time, respectively (see caption for details). A quick inspection of these
curves show that the disease decays almost immediately if the lockdown process occurs just after the first infected appeared in the block. Otherwise, the
number of infected people continues increasing until the day 150 (approximately).
Fig. 12 can be compared to its counterpart in the context of the IGLs,
that is, Fig. 9a. The time scales in both situations appear quite similar,
although the curves in Fig. 12a do not extend further than 200 days.

lockdown implementation day (100). Those blocks without infected individuals are represented in black, while those blocks with a number of infected people lower (greater)
than the threshold (see legend) are represent in orange (blue). Blue blocks were isolated
from the rest, while black and orange blocks were “opened”. The infection rate remains
constant along the simulation process and equals β0 = 0.75. The city was composed by
120 × 120 blocks placed on a square grid with 300 individuals per block.

The “threshold” of non-detected people is responsible for the time lapse
19

between the lockdown day and the end of the disease. This can be confirmed
through Fig. 13, that shows the contour maps for the infected blocks (see
caption for details). Notice that the non-detected blocks (say, the orange
ones) become more relevant as the “threshold” level increases.

isolate blocks/infected blocks

Fig. 14 exhibits the fraction of isolated blocks with respect to those blocks
attaining at least an infected individual. We can observe that half of the infected blocks are actually not detectable for a threshold as low as 5 individuals per block. This is a strong warning on the effectivity of the LLs. Public
health officers will lock down as many blocks as detected, but the undetected
will actually continue the propagation.

Whatever the efforts to detect infected, it seems that 40 − 45% of the
infected individuals do not experience noticeable symptoms [24]. We introduced this phenomenon into our simulations. Fig. 15 shows the overall
removed people for an increasing number of “non-symptomatic” individuals.
This confirms once more the lack of effectivity of the local lockdown if no
other policy is established.

Figure 15: Normalized number of removed individuals (at the end of the epidemic) as
a function of the percentage of asymptomatic individuals. The normalization was done
taking into account the city population. The LLs started at the day 100 after the first
infected was detected. The infection threshold is five individuals. From the lockdown
implementation day, the infection rate switches from β0 = 0.75 to β = 0.075 in , while
remains constant (β0 ) in .

A thoughtful policy should include either strategic testings and backward
tracing of the infected, from our point of view. We simulated this policy
by tracing back any infected people to where she (he) belonged before being
detected. The procedure in a nutshell is as follows:
• Test a random block. If infected, trace back all the individuals to the
block they visited before.
• Test all the blocks recognized as visited immediately before.
• Lock down any of the above if infected.
The results from these simulations are shown in Appendix C. The testing procedure exhibits a noticeable efficiency (say, a noticeable decay in the
number of removed people) if at least 80% of the blocks can be tested. The
back-tracing procedure further reduces this fraction significantly. Other complementary health-care policies (like masks, distancing, etc.) can also improve significantly the number of removed individuals (see Appendix C for
21

details). In summary, the simulation results confirm our intuition on the
effectivity of the back-tracing methodology.
We conclude from this Section that the effectivity of any LLs will strongly
depend on breaking off the mobility of infected people. If this fails (because
of asymptomatic or unreachable people), the disease will spread dramatically
throughout the city. The strategic testing and back-tracing of the infected
should be considered as an essential tool for the disease mitigation.

5. Analysis of the effects of the different strategies
In this Section we discuss the performance of the GLs, IGLs and LLs.
We limit our analysis to the following points
(a) The performance of the lockdown is actually associated to the mitigation of the disease. Smooth infection curves are preferred in order to
avoid stressing the medical care system.
(b) Lockdowns seriously damage the economy. The less disturbing and
shorter lasting actions on non-infected people are therefore preferred.

We propose a merit function in order to rate the performance of the different lockdown strategies above mentioned, with respect to conditions (a)
and (b). We will consider the fraction of the new infected people at any time
i(t) (or in at step n of the simulation) and the mobility µ(t) as the most
relevant quantities for building the merit function (see below for the precise
definitions). Thus, the merit function will be expressed as C = C(i, µ).
Notice from Section 4 that the maximum number of new infected people
is quite different for the examined scenarios (see, for example, Figs. 9 and
12). Our merit function will consider the new infected people (i) normalized
with respect to the maximum number of new infected when no lockdown is
carried out. Accordingly, we will consider the mobility fraction (µ) as the
amount of traveling people normalized with respect to the traveling people
before the lockdown.

22

The topic (a) concerns the infected people. The successful lockdown will
mitigate the overall number of infected people. Our first proposal would be
to rate the performance as the cumulative value of i along the lockdown period. This approach, however, does not consider the stressing of the medical
care system. For instance, it does not make any difference between sharp
infection curves and smooth ones, provided that the total number of infected
people are the same. We can therefore improve the proposed function by cumulating the fractions iα , for α > 1. The coefficient α introduces a penalty
to the sharp maximum (see below).
The topic (b) concerns the non-infected people. The lockdown breaks the
routine of the traveling fraction of people µ (1 − i), and consequently, the
economic activity. We propose rating the performance of the non-infected
motion as the aggregate of a linear function of µ (1 − i).
We express our merit function as follows

where n = 1...N stands for the day of the lockdown. The term (a) refers to
the medical care cost, and the term (b) refers to the economical cost.
Notice that in regular working days i = 0 and µ = 1. This yields a daily
economical cost equal to A + B, according to (4). We rate this cost as the
null cost (C = 0) for practical reasons. Thus, we set A + B = 0 to hold this
condition. The cost function then reads

This expression shows that an increase in the number of new infected people (although keeping µ = 1) yields an increase in the medical cost (a) and
the economical cost (b). The implementation of a strict lockdown (µ → 0)
further increases the economical cost (b) to its maximum value. The intermediate situations will be more or less costly according to the balance between
23

the medical care cost (a) and the economical cost(b) in expression (5). The
parameter A is the decisive parameter in the balance between the medical
care, and economical cost.
We stress that the proposed function (5) is limited to items (a) and (b),
while other presumably important arguments could have been left aside for
simplicity. We also fixed α = 2 for practical reasons, but we checked that C
behaves qualitatively the same for other values α > 1 (not shown).
The parameter A is actually the only free parameter in our cost function.
It stands as a weighting factor for the economical cost. We will discuss the
behavior of C for the lockdown strategies appearing in Section 4 while varying the values of A.
Let us first examine the medical care cost (a) and economical cost (b) separately. Fig. 16 plots these costs for the situations shown in Figs. 9 and 12,
respectively (see caption for details). The varying parameter is different on
each plot, that is, the horizontal axis corresponds to the mobility in Fig. 16a
and to the threshold level in Fig. 16b. The horizontal scale in Fig. 16a runs
from the most strict situation at the origin (µ = 0) to the normal moving
situation (µ = 1). Analogously, the horizontal scale in Fig. 16b runs from
the most early detection at the origin to a detection level of 10 individuals.
We present, however, both plots together in order to visualize the behavior
of the GLs, IGLs and LLs as the lockdown becomes more and more relaxed.
Fig. 16 resumes, indeed, the costs as a function of the lockdown strictness.
We notice from Fig. 16 that the medical cost, although different, shows a
quite similar behavior in the IGLs and the LLs (see green squares in there).
The economical costs, however, differ from each other when the lockdowns
are very strict. The mutual differences vanish for the relaxed situations, no
matter if the lockdown is global or local.
The dramatic increase of the economical cost (for the strict global lockdowns) is a matter of concern. Fig. 16a reports this phenomenon for small
mobility values (IGLs), although not for the null mobility situation (GLs).
The null mobility situation means that the disease remains confined to each
block. But if a few agents avoid the lockdown, they can additionally spread
the disease to other non-infected blocks. Thus, the perfect lockdown situa24

tion and the imperfect situation are quite different ones. This can be verified
by observing Fig. 9. The infection curve smoothens and widens as the mobility switches from 0% to 20%. For a mobility fraction of 50% the curve
narrows back again.
Either Fig. 9a and Fig. 16a point out that small mobility values induce a
slow spreading dynamics (i.e. no massive propagation). This does not stress
the medical care system, but yields long disruptions of the working routines.
Notice from the cost expression (5) that the term (b) is linear to N if µ ≈ 0.
Thus, the long lasting lockdowns are responsible for the increase in the economical costs.
The LLs isolates the infected blocks only. The mobility is locally suppressed, and the whole scene undergoes a mixture of blocks with full mobility
and blocks that are isolated. This is a dynamical process where the blocks
become isolated and are opened back again. The net result is that the overall
mobility is not significantly reduced along the lockdown, and therefore, the
spreading dynamic does not “slow down” completely, as already noticed in
Fig. 12a. Recall that the curves therein do not extend further than 200 days,
25

no matter the detection threshold. This prevents the dramatic increase in
the economic costs, as shown in Fig. 16b.

We turn now to the discussion of the different lockdown strategies performance. Fig. 17 shows the total cost C as a function of the weighting factor
A (see caption for details). Notice that although A can be chosen freely,
it seems unrealistic to allow values yielding to costs beyond the cost of nolockdown at all. We will consider the unlocked situation as the bounding
value to C, as shown in red in Fig. 17 (see caption for details).

simulation process and equals β0 = 0.75.

Fig. 17 reports the minimum cost situation in blue color ( ) for the GLs
and LLs. These correspond to either the most strict global lockdown (µ = 0)
or the most early detection for the local lockdown (say, the null threshold).
The latter attains a better performance with respect to the former for all the
explored values of A.
The economical cost (b) is responsible for the slope of the curves in Fig. 17.
The almost flat slope observed for the null threshold means that the daily
26

cost for this situation is negligible. This is in agreement with an early detection, where the fraction of infected people is quite small (i ≈ 0) and most of
the non-infected people are allowed to move around (µ ≈ 1). The reader can
check that this yields to vanishing values for the term (b) in our cost model
(5).
We further notice that the curves’ slope increases for increasing detection
thresholds in Fig. 17b. This occurs because of the increase in the daily economical cost, although the lockdown period remains close to N ≈ 200 days.
Interestingly, the lockdown curves in Fig. 17b meet the no-lockdown curve for
thresholds surpassing 2-3 infected people. This makes the lockdown curves
only valid for small values of A (say, below 0.7).
Recall that the IGLs experiences a dramatic increment of the economical
cost for small mobility fractions (see Fig. 16a). As a result, the lockdown
curves always meet the no-lockdown curve at some point (except for µ = 0),
as shown in Fig. 17a. This is quite a difference with respect to the local
strategy, since the lockdown curves are always limited to small values of A
(except for µ = 0).
Let us close the discussion with the following comments. We showed that
the most strict implementation of either the global or local lockdown leads to
the optimum performance (although the local one is preferred, as discussed
above). But we noticed that there is some space left for partially effective
lockdowns, if the most strict conditions are not attainable. The degree of
effectiveness depends on the balance between the medical care costs and the
economical costs, within this model.

6. Conclusions
This work concerns with the effect of human mobility in the context of a
model for the spatio-temporal evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak. People
move according to the Levy distribution and get into contact with each other
during their daily routine. The lockdowns prevent these contacts from occurring, and thus, mitigate the propagation of the disease. Our investigation
studies different lockdown scenarios and performs a careful evaluation of their
effectiveness. We draw some recommendations for the better performance of
27

the lockdown.
We assumed a SEIR compartmental model (with constant infection rates)
for the inhabitants of a block. Each block was considered as a node within
a square network of 120 × 120 nodes. People were allowed to travel twice
a day between blocks. The initial conditions for the simulations considered
20 infected individuals located at the central block of the network, while the
rest of the individuals were assumed to be in the susceptible state.
We focused on three scenarios: the full lockdown of all the blocks (perfect scenario), the partial lockdown of all the blocks (imperfect scenario), and
the lockdown of only the infected blocks (local lockdown). We sustained the
lockdown until the disease propagation was (almost) over.
We first noticed that the success of any control action depends strongly
on canceling the mobility around the city. But a small number of individuals may spoil the effectiveness of these actions if they do not follow the
confinement recommendations. This is, in our opinion, the major risk when
implementing any lockdown strategy.
We further built a cost function to rate the three strategies. We arrived
to the conclusion that full lockdowns, or, the (very) early detection and isolation strategy are the most effective ones. The local isolation strategy is
preferred, though, since it appears as the less costly in the context of our
model.
It is important to emphasize that strict lockdown policies also allow for
short periods of isolation. More relaxed lockdowns are less costly daily, but
cumulate large costs after an extended period of time.
The full lockdown looses effectivenesses if the mobility is not completely
canceled, as already mentioned. Our model shows that local lockdowns can
still be quite effective even if a small number of infected people is not detected
(and isolated). But the ultimate decision on whether to choose a global or
local lockdown on a specific circumstance will depend on the right balance
between the medical care cost and the economical cost due to routine disruptions. We will leave this discussion open to future research.

Appendix A. Global lockdown with complementary health policies
We analyze here the effects of complementary health policies during the
global lockdown. Fig. A.18a shows the number of new infected people along
time for three different infection rate (see caption for details). It is also shown
the evolution for the case of no lockdown at all. The mobility cutoff prevents
the infection curves in Fig. A.18a from growing almost immediately after the
beginning of the lockdown. In this sense, the more additional health policies,
the faster decrease of the new infected individuals.

corresponds to the scenario of no lockdown at all. In
the last case, the infection rate remains constant along the simulation process and equals
to β0 = 0.75.

Fig. A.18b exhibits the number of individuals that passed over the disease as a function of time (see caption for details). These correspond to those
individuals that previously appear as infected in Fig. A.18a. First, it can be
seen that the number of removed individuals increase since the outbreak of
the disease. Second, it reaches a plateau soon after the lockdown is established. The plateau level, however, strongly depends on the complementary
health policies. The more “intense” health policies (i.e. the lower infection
30

rate), the lower number of removed individuals.

Appendix B. Comparison between global and local lockdown
This appendix compare the global and local lockdown in terms of the
new infected individuals. Recall that the global lockdown “cutoff” the human mobility around the city. In this sense, all blocks are isolated from the
rest regardless of whether they are “infected” or not. On the contrary, the
mobility is suppressed (depending the infected threshold) only for the inhabitants of “infected blocks” in the local lockdown.

corresponds to the scenario of no lockdown at all. From the lockdown
implementation day, the infection rate switches from β0 = 0.75 to (1/3)β0 (in both cases).

Fig. B.19 shows the number of new infected people along time implementing a global and local lockdown (see caption for details). It is also shown
the evolution for the case of no lockdown at all. It can be seen that both
curves matches along time. This means that it is not necessary isolated all
blocks to reduce the infection. In this sense, as can be expected, only is
necessary isolated those infected blocks. Therefore, we can conclude that the
local lockdown is the ”efficient” case of the global lockdown.

Appendix C. Implementation of the testing & back-tracing strategy
We represent in this Section a possible testing procedure by means of a
probability p as follows:
1. We first chose (and test) a block at random with probability p.
2. If the chosen block is infected, we lock down the block until the disease
disappears. If not, the block remains “open”.
3. We trace back and test all the individuals who visited the infected
block.
4. We lock down any of the above blocks if infected.
5. We repeat this procedure every day.
Fig. C.20 shows the number of new infected people along time for three
different testing probabilities (see caption for details). It is also shown the
time evolution for the case of no lockdown at all. Notice that the propagation
decreases dramatically for the ideal tested scenario. But the possibility of
stopping the outbreak vanishes in a bad (or poor) testing scenario. As can
be seen in Fig. C.20 the back-tracing of the infected improves the mitigation
strategy.
Fig. C.21 shows the number of removed individuals at the end of the epidemic in terms of the testing probability p for three different complementary
health policies (see caption for details). It can be seen that, in a scenario
without complementary health policies (blue squares in Fig. C.21), a massive
testing (of more than 80%) is the only tool to avoid a wide spreading on the
population. Note that this percentage is significantly reduced to 60% if a
back tracing policy is also implemented.
Notice from Fig. C.21 that the implementation of strict complementary
health policies (such as the use of a mask and social distancing) improves
the mitigation of the disease.

Figure C.21: Normalized number of removed individuals at the end of the epidemic as a
function of the testing probability. The normalization was done with respect to the city
population. The local lockdown is applied when the number of new infected equals to 5k.
From the lockdown implementation day, the infection rate switches from β0 = 0.75 to:
β0 , (1/2)β0 and
(1/3)β0 (see text for more details). Dashed lines corresponds to
the scenario including back tracing of the infected individuals. Those infected blocks were
isolated until the infection within the corresponding block disappears.
