Abstract—The outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic results in
unprecedented demand for fast and efficient testing of large numbers of
patients for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Beside technical
improvements of the cost and speed of individual tests, pool testing
may be used to improve efficiency and throughput of a population
test. Dorfman pool testing procedure is one of the best known and
studied methods of this kind. This procedure is, however, based on
unrealistic assumptions that the pool test has perfect sensitivity and the
only objective is to minimize the number of tests, and is not well adapted
to the case of imperfect pool tests. We propose and analyze a simple
modification of this procedure in which test of a pool with negative result
is independently repeated up to several times. The proposed procedure
is evaluated in a computational study using recent data about dilution
effect for SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, showing that the proposed approach
significantly reduces the number of false negatives with a relatively small
increase of the number of tests, especially for small prevalence rates.
For example, for prevalence rate 0.001 the number of tests could be
reduced to 22.1% of individual tests, increasing the expected number of
false negatives by no more than 1%, and to 16.8% of individual tests
increasing the expected number of false negatives by no more than 10%.
At the same time, a similar reduction of the expected number of tests in
the standard Dorfman procedure would yield 675% and 821% increase
of the expected number of false negatives, respectively. This makes the
proposed procedure an interesting choice for screening tests in the case
of diseases like COVID-19.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Identification of infected patients is crucial for providing appropriate treatment and limit further transmission of COVID-19 disease.
Large number of infected or potentially infected patients results
in unprecedented demand for fast and efficient testing of large
populations. For example, the results of a recent simulation study
reported by Larremore et al. [16] demonstrate that effective screening
depends largely on frequency of testing and the speed of reporting
and could turn the COVID-19 tide within weeks. Some countries
have decided already to test the whole population. For example, in
October 2020 Slovakia decided to test all adults for SARS-CoV-2
[13]. However, due to the cost, availability, and efficiency of PCR
test, Slovakia’s government decided to use antigen tests which are
known to have lower sensitivity and specificity.
Beside technical improvements of the cost and speed of individual
tests, pool testing is an interesting option to improve efficiency and
throughput of a population test. Dorfman pool testing procedure is
one of the best known and studied methods of this kind [7]. In this
procedure, the subjects are grouped into a number of non-overlapping
pools and the specimens from the pool subjects are tested together. If
the result of a test for a pool is negative, all subjects are assumed to be
negative. Otherwise, all subjects from the pool are individually tested.
Since, the prevalence rate is usually much below 50%, many pools
may contain only negative subjects and may be efficiently identified.

supported by the statutory funds of the Faculty of Computing and Telecommunications, Poznan University of Technology.

Dorfman procedure procedure is, however, based on some assumptions that are not realistic in the context of COVID-19 and
many other diseases, and thus limit its practical applications. This
procedure assumes that the pool test has perfect sensitivity and the
only objective is efficiency usually expressed as minimization of the
number of tests. This assumption may seem justified in the case
of PCR tests, including tests for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA,
since in (reverse transcription) polymerase chain reaction the target
DNA is exponentially multiplied, thus theoretically even extremely
small amount of target DNA/RNA could be detected. In practice,
the sensitivity of pool test may become lower due to the dilution
effect [20], [25]. Indeed some recent studies confirm that dilution
significantly affects sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests [1], [5],
[23]. For example, Bateman et al. [5] estimated that pools of 5 (with
one positive subjects) lead to 93% sensitivity, pools of 10 lead to 91%
sensitivity, and pools of 50 lead to 81% sensitivity, while estimated
sensitivity for undiluted specimens is 99%. Thus, dilution effects are
significant and need to be appropriately taken into account.
With lower sensitivity of the pool test many subjects may be
false negative. Such situations are highly undesired in the context
of diseases like COVID-19 since they make impossible providing
appropriate treatment and limiting further transmission. Thus, test
efficiency should not be the only objective [19]. Although a number
of authors proposed improvements of Dorfman testing procedure
or other pool testing schemes, these modifications usually focus
on improving efficiency (number of tests) [15], [24], for example,
by using a hierarchy of sub-pools tested in more than two stages.
Hierarchical approach, however, even further increases the risk of a
subject being false negative, since a subject is assumed negative it
at least one of its (sub-)pool tests was negative. Other works take
into account only reduced specificity with the assumption of perfect
sensitivity [2], [8], [11]. There are relatively few studies taking into
account accuracy related objectives with imperfect sensitivity in pool
tests [4], [3], [14], [15]. Still, some of the approaches make the
assumption that the imperfect sensitivity is constant and the same for
both individual and pool tests [3], [9], [10], [15], [17], in other words,
they do not take into account the dilution effect. Some works taking
into account the dilution effect concern the problem of estimating
the prevalence rate [21], [22], [26], not the problem of identifying
positive/negative subjects. Furthermore, even the studies that consider
dilution effect with false negatives as (partial) objective [4], [14], [27]
do not propose modifications of the Dorfman test procedure that could
reduce the number of false negatives. In general, in our opinion, the
development of efficient and precise pool testing procedures did not
obtain sufficient interest from the research community, due to limited
practical interest before the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.
We show, that the standard Dorfman pool testing procedure is not
well adapted to the case of imperfect pool tests with the objective of
minimizing the number of false negatives and we propose a simple
modification of this procedure in which test of a pool with negative
result is independently repeated up to a given number of times. This
approach significantly reduces the number of false negatives with a
relatively small increase of the number of tests.
We present also a numerical study based on the recently reported

2

data about the influence of the dilution effect on the sensitivity of
SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests [5]. We show that the modified procedure
is better on both the expected number of false negatives and the
number of tests than the standard Dorfman procedure for a wide
range of parameters. We show also that the proposed procedure may
significantly reduce the expected number of tests with practically negligible increase of the expected number of false negatives compared
to individual tests.
Several authors proposed repeating test of pools (retesting) under
some conditions [9], [10], [17]. In particular our procedure could
bee seen as the special case of the procedure proposed by Graff and
Roeloffs [9] with r1 = 1 and r2 = r. Still there are some important
differences between these works and our approach, namely:
•

•

•
•

These works do not take into account dilution effect, which
significantly influences the analysis and performance of pool
testing.
The presented analysis differs from ours, in particular we use
Bayes’ theorem to update posterior probabilities.
We present a simulation study verifying the presented analysis.
We do not propose to repeat test of pools with positive results,
since although it could slightly reduce the number of false
positives, it increases the number of tests. At the same time,
the number of false positives has relatively low importance in
the context of diseases like COVID-19.

Furthermore, in [18] Nyongesa described a procedure in which a pool
with negative result is retested just once, however, this procedure was
analyzed only from the point of view of prevalence rate estimation
without dilution effect.
The contributions of this paper are:

A modified Dorfman pool testing procedure for pool tests with
dilution effect designed to improve the number of false negatives
at a moderate cost of increased number of tests is proposed.
Analytical formulas for the number of tests, the number of false
negatives and the number of false positives in the proposed
procedure are derived.
The analytical formulas are verified in a computational simulation study.
The practical contribution of the paper is that through a computational case study using recent data about SARS-CoV-2 PCR
tests sensitivity it is shown that the proposed procedure may be
highly beneficial in the case of diseases like COVID-19.

The paper is organized in the following way. In the next Section,
we define basic concepts and notation. Then, we present the analysis
of the standard Dorfman pool testing procedure from the point of
view of the number of tests, the number of false negatives and the
number of false positives. In Section four, we introduce the proposed
procedure and analyze its properties. In the fifth Section, we present
a computational case study for SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. Finally, we
present conclusions and directions for further research.
II. P RELIMINARIES
Let p = P (Ps = 1) be the probability of a subject being positive
(prevalence rate), where Ps ∈ {0, 1} is a random variable describing
that the subjects is positive (Ps = 1) or negative (Ps = 0). Let Sp be
the test specificity, i.e. the conditional probability that the outcome
of the test is negative given the subjects is negative. Let Se be test
sensitivity, i.e. the conditional probability that the outcome of the test
is positive given the subjects is positive.
Probability of a test being true negative in a given test is Sp (1−p).
Probability of a test being true positive in a given test is Se p.
Probability of a test being false negative in a given test is (1−Se)p.

Probability of a test being false positive in a given test is (1 −
Sp)(1 − p).
Let SpI and SeI denote specificity and sensitivity of an individual
test. If each subject is tested individually, the expected number
of false negatives E(F N ), the expected number of false positives
E(F P ), and the number of tests T per subject are:
E(F N ) = (1 − Se)p

(1)

E(F P ) = (1 − Sp)(1 − p)

(2)

T =1

(3)

Consider a pool of size n. The probability that there is at least one
positive subject in the pool (pool is positive) is
pP = 1 − (1 − p)n

(4)

Let SpP and SeP denote specificity and sensitivity of a pool test.
It is reasonable to assume that SpP = SpI = Sp, since in both cases
we deal with a sample containing no virus RNA.

probability of having k positive subjects in the pool of size n that
could be derived from binomial distribution. SeP is the same for
each pool assuming constant pool size and homogeneous subjects
(i.e. constant p). In practice SpP = SpI = Sp and SeI are close to
1. SeP , SeP (n, k) ≤ SeI and SeP (n, k) decreases with growing n
and increases with k.
Let T ∈ {0, 1} denote the random variable being outcome of the
pool test. The probability of a pool test being (true or false) positive
is:
P (T = 1) = SeP pP + (1 − Sp)(1 − pP )
(6)
and the probability of a pool test being (true or false) negative is:
P (T = 0) = (1 − SeP )pP + Sp(1 − pP )

IV. M ODIFIED POOL TESTING PROCEDURE

k=1

The weak point of pool tests is decreased sensitivity compared to
an individual test. In result, the number of false negatives may be
increased. This weak point could be, however, resolved by repeating
test for the same pool, if the results of the previous tests were
negative, until the last test was positive or a given number of tests
were negative. In other words, we assume that the pool test is positive,
if at least one result was positive and we assume that the pool test is
negative, if all results were negative. The decision tree of the repeated
pool test is presented in Figure 1. Note, that we assume that for each
pool test, different samples from each subject are used, so the results
of the repeated tests may be assumed to be independent.
Let T 00 ∈ {0, 1} denote the random variable being outcome of the
pool test (with potential repeats). The probability of a pool test being
(true or false) positive is:
P (T 00 = 1) = Se00P pP + (1 − Sp00 )(1 − pP )

(11)

and the probability of a pool test being (true or false) negative is:
P (T 00 = 0) = (1 − Se00P )pP + Sp00 (1 − pP )

(12)

Sp00P = Spr ≤ Sp

where:

P (T 00 = 1)
Lemma IV.2. With the same parameters, the modified procedure has
lower or equal expected number of false negatives than the standard
Dorfman test:
E(F N 00 ) ≤ E(F N 0 )
Proof. It is a direct consequence of Se00P (n, k) ≥ SeP (n, k), k =
1, . . . , n.
Lemma IV.3. With the same parameters, the modified procedure has
greater or equal expected number of individual tests and total number
of tests than the standard Dorfman test:
E(TI00 ) ≥ E(TI0 )
E(T 00 ) ≥ E(T 0 )
Proof. E(TI00 ) ≥ E(TI0 ) results from P (T 00 = 1) ≥ P (T = 1).
E(T 00 ) ≥ E(T 0 ) results from E(TI00 ) ≥ E(TI0 ) and the fact that
already the first iteration of pool tests in the modified procedure
requires the same number of tests as the first stage in the standard
procedure.
Lemma IV.4. The expected number of false negatives if greater or
equal than in the case of individual tests:
E(F N 00 ) ≥ E(F N )

is the repeated test specificity and

is the repeated test sensitivity (see Appendix B).
Lemma IV.1. P (T 00 = 1) ≥ P (T = 1) and P (T 00 = 0) ≤ P (T =

Proof. It is direct consequence of Sp00P ≤ Sp and Se00P ≥ SeP

and E(F N 00 ) achieves minimum equal to (1 − SeI )p = E(F N ), if
Se00P (n, k) = 1, k = 1, . . . , n.
Proof. Se00P (n, k)) ∈ [0, 1], k = 1, . . . , n and E(F N 00 ) in nonincreasing with Se00P (n, k)), k = 1, . . . , n, thus E(F N 00 ) achieves
minimum for Se00P (n, k) = 1, k = 1, . . . , n.

V. C OMPUTATIONAL CASE STUDY
We verify the presented analysis and evaluate the proposed procedure using recent data about the influence of the dilution effect on
the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests [5]. Since, however, the
authors presented results (values of Se(n, k)) only for some specific
values of n = 1, 5, 10, 50 and k = 1 we need to fit to the data a
model allowing calculation of Se(n, k) for other values of n and k.
We tried first the model proposed in [6] and used also in [4]:
n
Se(n, k) = 1 − Sp + (SeI + Sp − 1)( )α
(21)
k
with Sp ≥ 0.99, however, this model did not fit the data perfectly
(MSE = 0.000781). So, we decided to extend this model with a linear
term:
n
Se(n, k) = 1 − Sp + (SeI + Sp − 1)( )α + β k
(22)
k
This model fitted the data almost perfectly (MSE = 0.000026) with
α = 0.032482 and β = −0.001255. We hypothesize that the linear
term reflects PCR test dependence not only on the relative but also
on the absolute amount of virus RNA and remaining material.
We tested the proposed procedure for prevalence rates p = 0.001,
0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3. Our procedure involves
two parameters, pool size n and number of iterations of pool test r.
Since their values are integer and reasonable ranges of their values
are relatively small, all potential settings could be enumerated. We
used n = 2, . . . , 50 and r = 2, . . . , 5. We did not try higher numbers
of iterations, since they would be highly impractical and 5 iterations
was enough to assure the expected number of false negatives very
close to that of individual tests.
We performed two kinds of computational studies. First, we used
the analytical formulas presented above. Second, we simulated the
procedures for 100, 000, 000 subjects drawn randomly as either positive or negative with a given prevalence rate. By comparing results
of the analytical and simulation studies we verified the analytical
formulas. In Table I we present mean relative squared errors between
the analytical and simulation results for particular parameters and
methods. These results confirm very good agreement between the
analytical and simulation study.
We compare the proposed procedure to the standard Dorfman
procedure and to individual tests. Since false positives are much
less important than false negatives in the context of diseases like
COVID-19, we decided to use two main objectives i.e. the expected
number of false negatives and the expected number of tests. Thus,
we deal with a bi-objective optimization problem with two integer
variables defining feasible solutions (settings of parameters) [12]. For
each value of p, only Pareto-optimal solutions were preserved. A
solution is Pareto-optimal (non-dominated, efficient) if there exists
no other feasible solution better on one of the objectives and not
worse on other objective(s). For solutions that are not Pareto-optimal
it is possible to improve one objective without deteriorating other(s),
so they do not constitute reasonable parameters for pool tests.

All detailed numerical results and the source code used in this
computational study are available at dedicated web page 1 . In Figure 2
we present exemplary sets of Pareto-optimal solutions of the standard
Dorfman and the proposed procedure for selected values of p. The
results are presented relative to the results corresponding to individual
tests of all subjects. As it can be seen, the proposed procedure
performs especially well for low prevalence rates and is able to assure
much lower expected numbers of false negatives than the standard
Dorfman procedure with the similar expected number of tests. Note,
however, that if reduction of the number of tests is the main objective,
the standard Dorfman testing procedure could assure lower expected
number of tests than the proposed procedure.
Furthermore, the proposed procedure allows for a significant reduction of the expected number of tests with very low increase of
the expected number of false negatives compared to individual tests.
To analyze it more precisely, in Table II we present Pareto-optimal
solutions for the proposed procedure that assure no more than 1%,
10%, and 100% increase of the expected number of false negatives
with the minimum expected number of tests. Note, that for p = 0.2
and p = 0.3 no such solutions exist with the expected number of tests
lower than the number of tests in individual testing. These results
confirm that the proposed procedure may be highly beneficial with
low prevalence rates. For example, for p = 0.001 the number of tests
could be reduced to 22.1% of individual tests increasing the expected
number of false negatives by no more than 1%, and to 16.8% of
individual tests increasing the expected number of false negatives by
no more than 10%. At the same time, a similar reduction of the
expected number of tests (to 26.4% and 18.2%, respectively) in the
standard Dorfman procedure would yield 675% and 821% increase
of the expected number of false negatives, respectively.
Although, we treat the numbers of tests and of false negatives as the
main objectives, in Table III we report also the average numbers of
false positives for Pareto-optimal solutions in compared procedures.
As it could be observed, the number of false positives in the proposed

[4]. Another possibility would be to apply hierarchical approach [15]
in the case of pools tested positively that could perhaps further reduce
the expected number of tests.
In this study, we assumed that pool test is repeated with the same
pool. Another possibility would to re-shuffle the subjects from the
negative pools into new pools. It is yet to be established is such
approach could bring some benefits.
Note, however, that adding a hierarchical approach or pools reshuffling would increase complexity, while an advantage of the proposed procedure is relative simplicity which may be very important
for practical implementations.

After obtaining a pool test result, the posterior probability of being
positive should be updated for the subjects in this pool using Bayes’
theorem. If the test result was negative i.e. T = 0:

VI. C ONCLUSIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH
We have presented a modified pool testing procedure which could
significantly reduce the number of tests at a very low cost of
increasing the number of false negatives. We have derived analytical
formulas for the main objectives and verified them iscreening n a
simulation study. We have also shown that the proposed procedure
may be highly beneficial for SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening tests.
In this work we assumed a homogeneous population of subjects
with constant prevalence rate. An interesting research direction would
be to consider heterogeneous subjects with different prevalence rates

The expected number of subjects in negative pools that are not
individually tested is:
P (T = 0)
(30)
The probability that one of these subjects is false negative is P (Ps =
1|T = 0) Thus, the expected number of false negative subjects from
the pool testing stage is:
E(F NP0 )

A subject is individually tested if its pool test result was true or
false positive. The expected number of subjects individually tested in
the second phase is:
E(TI0 ) = P (T = 1)

(32)

So, the expected number of false negatives in the second stage is:

A PPENDIX B
M ODIFIED POOL TESTING PROCEDURE
In repeated pool test we need to update test specificity and
sensitivity for each value of k. As can be seen from the Figure 1
the repeated pool test specificity with r iterations is
Sp00P = Spr ≤ Sp

(37)

and the repeated pool test sensitivity is
Se00P (n, k) = 1 − 1 − SeP (n, k)

r

≥

SeP (n, k), k = 1, . . . , n

(38)

Obviously Se00P (n, k) > SeP (n, k), k = 1, . . . , n, if SeP (n, k) < 1.
Note that the sensitivity of the repeated pool test may be higher
than the sensitivity of an individual test if

Following the analysis presented for the standard Dorfman pool
testing procedure we can calculate the expected numbers of false
negatives in the first E(F NP00 ) and the second E(F NI00 ) stage, the
total expected numbers of false negatives E(F NI00 ), the expected
number of tests in the second stage E(TI00 ), and the expected number
of false positives E(F P 00 ):

E(TI00 ) = P (T 00 = 1)

To calculate the expected number of tests we add the number of
pool tests and the expected number of subjects tested individually in
the second phase:
E(T 0 ) =

To calculate the expected number of tests we need to take into
account that the pool test for a pool is repeated if all previous tests for
this pool were negative. Consider iteration number l. The probability
that a pool was true negative in iterations 1, . . . , l − 1 is:

1

+ E0 (TI ) = + P (T = 1)

(36)

(45)

To calculate the probability that a pool was false negative in iterations
1, . . . , l − 1 we need to consider each k = 1, . . . , n. This probability
for a given k is:
pP (1 − SeP (n, k))l−1
(46)
and for all k = 1, . . . , n:
