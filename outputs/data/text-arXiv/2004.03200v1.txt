The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and the disease it causes, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic
on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization. Since then, the disease has spread all over the
world, with the United States becoming the country with the highest number of cases. Governments
around the world have undertaken varying degrees of public safety measures, including
recommendations and ad campaigns for improved hygiene practices, enacting social distancing
requirements and limiting large public gatherings, and stay-at-home orders and lockdowns. In the
United States, while the response has varied greatly from state to state, we clearly see that the effect
of these public safety measures is significant and, if these measures continue to remain in effect, or
are expanded to a nationwide lockdown, the pandemic can be controlled and the disease likely
overcome with mitigated consequences. In this paper, we model the spread of the novel coronavirus
using a causal model. We find that, with continued lockdown measures, the United States can,
according to this model, limit the total number of infections to ~1.35 million and the total number of
deaths to ~72 thousand. A 60 day lockdown can save countless lives.

Introduction and Motivation

The United States has become the worst hit in
terms of the number of cases, and, as a result, has
enacted many of these public safety measures.
Though there is no nationwide lockdown, most
states have issued stay-at-home orders and have
closed all non-essential businesses, in addition to
social distancing measures.
The current social distancing and lockdown
measures are vital to our society‚Äôs survival and we
simply wished to provide a brief, simple analysis
to make it clear why that is and to implore people
to obey these measures. We further argue that
increased social distancing measures can serve to
further prevent this disease from getting
completely out of control.
We are not epidemiologists, but rather
engineers. The bulk of what is being pushed by
experts in the field, however, is proving
inaccurate due to the reliance on analogy to
previous outbreaks of similar viruses, and also
ineffective in making the case for the importance
of continued implementation and obedience of
these public health measures. As a result, we
intend to make this case in a clear, accessible
fashion in this short paper.
In this paper, we present a statistical
treatment of the COVID-19 outbreak in the
United States. This is implemented through the
use of a causal model to describe the effect of the

COVID-19 was first observed as a zoonotic
disease in a human in December of 2019 in
Wuhan. Because SARS-CoV-2, the virus that
confers COVID-19, has several methods of spread
and
because
of
its
relative
ease
of
communicability from human to human, this
disease has been spreading around the world at a
very high pace, having been declared a global
pandemic by the World Health Organization on
March 11, 2020.
Countries all around the world have been
working to try to combat the pandemic through
public safety measures, which predominantly
involve promoting improved hygiene practices,
like frequent and lengthy hand washing,
enactment of social distancing measures, such as
guidelines for keeping more than six feet apart
from others and cancellation of large events and
bans on gatherings of more than a few people,
and, stay-at-home or lockdown orders, requiring
the closing of non-essential businesses and
banning outdoor movement, except as it pertains
to health, sustenance necessities, or those
businesses deemed essential. This is in addition to
schools and universities having been closed, and
most workplaces shifting exclusively to a workfrom-home model.

public safety measures as enacted. This causal
model is used to describe the decreased growth
rate, in the days since strong public safety
measures have gone into effect in the country.
This model allows us to make reasonable,
indicative projections on the spread of the disease
and its impact in terms of hospitalizations and
deaths over time.
The paper is organized as follows: in Section
II, we introduce and justify our assumptions and
methodology for building our model, which is
constructed using the data available from the
COVID Tracking Project [1]. Next, in Section III,
we show the results of the projection of our model
forward in time for infections, hospitalizations,
and deaths, and highlight the impact of the public
safety measures. Lastly, we provide a discussion
of the primary takeaways of our findings and
conclude with some recommendations, as well as
acknowledge the limitations of the analysis
conducted herein.
II.

just how powerful the precautionary measures of
social distancing and stay-at-home orders are, and
how important it is that the public obey them.
We looked at the data in two segments: before
any relevant lockdown/stay-at-home measures
were implemented, and after they were
implemented in significant portions of the
country. We observed the direct data for the
period before the quarantine and modeled that as
an exponential growth curve (Malthusian model)
of the form:

ùëì(ùë•) = ùê¥ùëí ùëòùë°

(1)

where ùê¥ is the intercept, ùëò is the exponential
growth coefficient, and ùë° is time, in days. This
provided us with a benchmark model for
unmitigated spread of the virus. It should be noted
that we did not account for any damping effect as
larger portions of the population are infected. We
ignored the effect of the predator-prey-like
population damping, as this only becomes
significant as society approaches herd-immunity
levels, which are generally posited as being 60%+
of the population,[2] and we feel it would be
irresponsible to even model such a scenario, since
any competent society would fight tooth-and-nail
to avoid this, especially because of the high CFR
(Case Fatality Rate) of the disease, which is
estimated at 1.4% [3], though the reported CFRs
from the current data suggest a number that may
be much higher. For reference, the Spanish Flu of
1918 had a CFR of ~2.5% and resulted in more than
50 million deaths [4], so the 1.4% CFR of COVID19 is of grave concern, especially when coupled
with how freely transmissible it is. As a result, in
order to maintain justifiable accuracy, while
avoiding indicating scenarios that should not
occur in practice, we only project out the beforelockdown data a few days (well in advance of any
damping effect or predator-prey behavior takes
hold). The intent of projecting the no lockdown
data out is to demonstrate how significant the
impact of the lockdown and similar measures has
been and will continue to be, and this point is
sufficiently clear without the need to project out
to potentially cataclysmic levels of infection.
In addition, we applied a modified
exponential growth model for the after lockdown
period. This was done by treating the exponent as
not constant, but rather a function of time (meant
to represent the impact of the lockdown). This
function of time was implemented as a causal
model of exponential decay. As before, the only
damping force that was modeled was that of the

Methodology

The limited understanding of the virus
epidemiologically has limited the ability of
experts to apply science-derived models that
depend on knowing several key properties of the
virus and the kinetics and means of its spread, its
incubation period, and additional mechanistic
behavior about SARS-CoV-2. While we recognize
that these types of science-based models (which
may or may not be enhanced by statistical
learning) are generally very powerful and tend to
prove
superior
to
black-box
statistical
approaches, the current state-of-the-art sciencebased approaches in the field of epidemiology
have been relatively unsuccessful, in this
particular instance. The reason for this is that a lot
of early modeling was built by assuming some of
these sophisticated models apply, but using
properties analogous to other similar viruses, such
as SARS or MERS, for which there was ample data
available. However, this particular virus seems to
behave very differently from those previous
outbreaks, thus rendering those models
inaccurate.
Because these efforts have proven difficult,
due to the ad-hoc manner in which they must be
applied, we thought it best to demonstrate our
point through straightforward implementation of
statistical analysis: pure regression of a causal
model, with very limited assumptions. The
implementation is relatively straightforward and
is meant to provide an accessible explanation of
2

impact of the public safety measures, as the
projected levels of infection come nowhere near
the level at which herd-immunity and predatorprey-like damping becomes relevant.
This can be thought of as treating social
distancing and stay-at-home orders as analogous
to the addition of control rods to a nuclear
reaction. In the absence of the control rods, the
fission continues unobstructed, as there is no
shortage of particles, enabling extremely frequent
collisions. However, the introduction of the
control rods reduces the frequency of the
collisions, because the control rods absorb the
particles, reducing the number of free-moving
particles that can collide. In the same way, the
number of people freely moving who can spread
the disease, or unto whom the disease can be
spread, is greatly reduced by these social
distancing and lockdown measures, which is akin
to the reduction of collisions in our analogy.
Due to the noise in the data, which comes
largely as a result from the data being discretized
on a daily basis (and thus, a highly limited number
of data points are available) and due to the high
degree of variability of number of tests conducted
and inconsistent testing, we chose to smooth the
data as a three-day moving average of the growth
rate. This is what was actually modeled for the
exponential decay of the exponent.
This prediction model is constructed as
follows. The general assumption of an
exponential growth curve for the spread of the
virus is maintained. Therefore, the following
equation describes the growth is the same as
equation (1), except that ùëò is no longer treated as
a constant, as it was for the unmitigated growth

case. Rather, ùëò is described by a causal model to
account for the damping force of the public safety
measures, as follows:

Figure 1: The exponential growth fit of the cumulative
number of COVID-19 infections across the country, prior
to widespread adoption of lockdown.

Figure 2: The causal model fit of exponential decay to
inter-day growth rate of total COVID-19 infections across
the country, in the days since widespread adoption of
lockdown.

ùëò = ùê¥1 ùëí ‚àíùëêùë°

(2)

where ùê¥1 and ùëê are both positive valued constants
that are fit to the growth rate over time, and ùëò and
ùë° are the same as before.
This exponential decay function that was fit to
the exponent was then applied to the data as a
simple multiplicand between subsequent days and
projected out, as described in the following
recursion relation:

ùëìùëõ = (ùëìùëõ‚àí1 )ùëí ùëòùëõ

(3)

where the ùëõ and ùëõ ‚àí 1 subscripts indicate the
results on the ùëõùë°‚Ñé and (ùëõ ‚àí 1)ùë°‚Ñé day, respectively.
As an additional note, we also only used
country-wide data,[1] as the state-by-state data
lacks granularity for more meaningful analysis.
Further, the state-by-state data is far noisier, due
to local variations in testing rates, backlogs,
incomplete reporting, and inconsistent response
to the coronavirus pandemic. A more
macroscopic, country-wide view smooths out this
data and allows for more statistically significant
analysis.
It should be further understood that the
delineation between the prior to lockdown and
post-lockdown data is not very clear, due to
inconsistent implementation across states, plus
there is a lag factor due to several factors,
including the time between testing and obtaining
results.

Results
Our analysis of the unmitigated (prior to
lockdown effects) growth of infections (see Figure
1) produced the following model:

ùëì(ùë°) = 167.7ùëí 0.3208ùë°

(4)

Similarly, we acquired the following causal
model for the exponential decay of the growth
rate of the post-lockdown effect growth rate of
infections (see Figure 2):

for continued lockdown protocol, alongside real COVID-19
death data.

ùëò = 1.2207ùëí ‚àí0.079ùë°

(5)

From these models, we were able to construct
figures 3 and 4, which show the daily and
cumulative infections, respectively.

for continued lockdown protocol, alongside real COVID-19
death data.

In Figure 3, our model indicates that daily
infections, under continued lockdown protocols,
should peak on April 09, 2020 (day 37) at 39,329
new infections on that day. The rate of new
infections drops below 1,000 new cases per day
on day 96 (June 7, 2020).
In figure 4, our model indicates that the total
number of COVID-19 infections should plateau at
~1.35 Million cases, with fewer than 100 additional
daily cases on day 126 (July 7, 2020).
Due to the nature of an exponential growth
model with exponential decay of its exponential
coefficient, there is a very long tail to continuing
introduction of low levels of new cases. A real
world scenario would likely see a slightly more
rapid de-escalation than our model describes, in
the region that is well past the peak daily infection
rate.
To model the hospitalizations, we used the
number of hospitalizations in the COVID tracking
project to calculate a percentage of new cases
requiring hospitalization, as well as calculating the
mean cycle time for hospital stay (which ends in
either death or recovery). From this data, we
found that 13.24% of cases require hospitalization,
and that the mean hospital stay is 6 days, modeled
using Little‚Äôs Law. Thus, we modeled the active
case hospitalizations by building a recursive
relationship:

‚Ñéùëñ = ‚Ñéùëñ‚àí1 ‚àí ‚Ñéùëñ‚àí6 + .1324ùëêùëñ

of when each subset would have arrived at the
hospital), we continued with the same mean
hospital stay. We found that 40% of
hospitalizations end in death and used the mean
hospital stay of 6 days. Thus, we modeled the
death rate by building a recursive relationship:

ùëëùëñ = ùëëùëñ‚àí1 + .4‚Ñéùëñ‚àí6

(7)

From this, we constructed figures 6 and 7.
Figure 6 shows that the death rate, according to
our model, is expected to peak on April 15, 2020
(day 43) at 2083 daily deaths. This rate will drop
below 200 daily deaths on day 85 (May 27, 2020)
and below 100 daily deaths on day 95 (June 6,
2020).
As shown in Figure 7, our model indicates that
the total death rate will plateau at ~72,000 deaths,
as a result of COVID-19. While this is certainly a
very high number, it is a fraction of what would
occur if lockdown protocols are not continued. It
should also be noted that this prediction is a far
lower number than those of many existing studies,
most notably the numbers put out by the CDC and
White House Coronavirus Task Force [5].

Discussion and Conclusion

We do not subscribe to the notion that the
prevalence of the virus is much higher, as posited
by some researchers, to the level of herdimmunity. Even counting for asymptomatic cases,
the number of ill people testing as positive for
COVID-19 is relatively low (<20%). This is a clear,
statistically significant indication that, even if the
total tally is not capturing 100% of cases, we are
nowhere near herd-immunity levels. Beyond
rendering any analysis moot, such a notion (which
has no meaningful statistical or scientific basis) is
irresponsible and dangerous, as it promotes an
idea that it is safe to break lockdown.
While we could attempt to draw declarative
quantitative conclusions about exactly how many
deaths there will be, the ventilator and ICU bed
needs, the total number of cases, when we will hit
our peak, and when we will see the last case of
COVID-19, we choose to avoid falling for this trap.
There is significant noise in the data. There is high
sensitivity in the models. We have provided our
models and projections and they should be
thought as indicative of the number of cases,
deaths, hospital requirements, and peak and fall of
the pandemic, but not taken as declarative fact.
As another point, as mentioned earlier, the
model predicts a very long tail to the infection.

(6)

where ‚Ñé is the number of active case
hospitalizations, the subscripts represent the day,
and ùëê is the daily infection rate.
From this, we constructed figure 5, which
shows
that
our
model
predicts
that
hospitalizations should peak on April 11, 2020
(day 39) at 30,966 hospitalizations. Should this
prediction hold true, it will be a great relief, as it
would be manageable by our nation‚Äôs healthcare
system. However, as a note, since we are looking
at nationwide data, there is a possibility for
inequitable distribution of these hospitalizations,
such as may be the case in certain parts of New
York or New Jersey, where, locally, the system
may become overloaded.
From the hospitalizations, we similarly
extracted the death rate. We analyzed the
COVID-19 death data to determine a percentage
of hospitalizations that end in death and used the
same cycle time for hospitalization as determined
before. As a note, there is likely a difference in
terms of cycle time for recovery vs. cycle time for
death, but, for lack of granularity (no knowledge
5

this analysis would not have been possible. All figures
were generated in MATLAB R2019a.

While a long tail is generally expected for a
pandemic to end, the causal model implemented,
by its very nature, is a lot less aggressive in its rate
of descent as the infection rate falls to low levels
after the peak. A real world scenario would likely
be more aggressive in the latter stages than our
model indicates.
We also did not build a stochastic model and,
as such, do not have error bars on our projections.
The data, being discretized only on a daily basis,
was too limited to construct such a model. As
such, this is a limitation to our analysis.
What is very clear from this analysis, however,
is that the effect of the stay-at-home and
lockdown measures are profound and the
absence of them, or disobeying them, is
devastating.
Bootsma and Ferguson, in a paper studying
the impact of the United States public health and
safety measures taken in response to the outbreak
of the 1918 Spanish flu in Europe, found a
profound link between the speed with which such
measures are implemented, how long and
effectively they are maintained, and how effective
they are in mitigating the spread and death rate
caused by the pandemic [6]. As a result, the United
States did not suffer nearly as terrible of
consequences as Europe did during that
pandemic.
A 60 day nationwide lockdown would most
likely see us through the COVID-19 pandemic.
Maintaining of general social distancing practices
and use of face-masks, and improved hygiene
habits (washing hands frequently, avoiding
physical contact, etc.) for a period of time
thereafter, upon lifting of lockdown, would allow
us to transition back to a new normal, while
allowing us to limit the level of the overall
outbreak, as best we can. Ideally, this period of
continued social distancing and general
precautions would last until at least a vaccine has
been developed and is readily available, or,
similarly, an adequate anti-viral pharmaceutical
treatment or cure is on the market and accessible
to the masses. For more specificity on what that
should look like, we would defer to the
appropriate experts and authorities, namely the
CDC and the United States Federal Government
once we reach that juncture.
