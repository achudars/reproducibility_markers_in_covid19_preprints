ABSTRACT
COVID-19 has impacted the economy of almost every country in the world. Of particular interest
are the responses of the economic indicators of developing nations (such as BRICS) to the COVID19 shock. As an extension to our earlier work on the dynamic associations of pandemic growth,
exchange rate, and stock market indices in the context of India, we look at the same question with
respect to the BRICS nations. We use structural variable autoregression (SVAR) to identify the
dynamic underlying associations across the normalized growth measurements of the COVID-19
cumulative case, recovery, and death counts, and those of the exchange rate, and stock market
indices, using data over 203 days (March 12 ‚Äì September 30, 2020). Using impulse response
analyses, the COVID-19 shock to the growth of exchange rate was seen to persist for around 10+
days, and that for stock exchange was seen to be around 15 days. The models capture the
contemporaneous nature of these shocks and the subsequent responses, potentially guiding to
inform policy decisions at a national level. Further, causal inference-based analyses would allow
us to infer relationships that are stronger than mere associations.

INTRODUCTION
With the four fastest growing developing nations - Brazil, Russia, India, and China - an
organization termed BRIC in short was first brought together at Yekaterinburg, Russia in 2008 for
its first summit, the term having been in use since the beginning of the millennium (O'neill, 2001).
In 2010, South Africa joined in, and BRICS was formed (Nkoane-Mashabane, 2012). The BRICS
represents 41.42% of the total population in the world and contributes 24.10% of the world‚Äôs total
GDP, as in 2019, with a 16.25% export share (BRICS Policy Center, 2019). BRICS is unique in
that it is a successful international organization with developing nations from geographically
different parts of the world. The growth rate of population in the member nations of BRICS
combinedly decreased by 3.20% from 2010 to 2019 but the percentage share in GDP increases by
34.04% with an average increment of 3.80% yearly during the same period (Appendices 1-2) (The
World Bank, 2021). The BRICS countries were no exception in terms of being impacted by the
global COVID-19 pandemic in different socio-economic ways, and have been the epicentres of
recent research interest in quantifying those effects (Dash et al., 2021; Isheloke, 2020).
In a recent study, we explored the associations among the growth rates of infected COVID cases,
exchange rate, and SENSEX, in the context of India (Banerjee et al., 2020). Simple correlationbased analyses indicated that the growth rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases was positively
correlated with the growth of the exchange rate of Indian currency, but negatively correlated with
that of SENSEX. In a further dynamic analysis based on vector autoregressive models (VAR), the
associations were not found to be statistically significant but were suggestive, and a time-varying
pattern in the directions of the associations was observed, modulated by the non-pharmaceutical
interventions such as lockdowns and unlocks implemented by the government (Banerjee et al.,
2020). Another recent study focused on the role of the stock market in the Indian economy and the

correlation between the performance of the stock market and economic growth, suggesting that
the identification of factors affecting stock market is a necessity for government policymakers to
formulate and target decisions guiding the nation towards development (Salameh & Ahmad).
Several studies in the post-COVID research scene have attempted to answer the question of
dynamic shock response in exchange rates and/or stock markets focusing on different locations
such as Japan (Narayan et al., 2020), Indonesia (Syahri & Robiyanto, 2020), and Australia
(Narayan et al., 2021). Given the significance of the BRICS in the international context, as
discussed in the beginning of this section, these nations too deserve a closer investigation of their
economic repercussions to the COVID-19.
As a natural extension of our previous work focused on India, we formulate this study to explore
the associations among the pandemic and the economic indicators across the BRICS nations over
the span of March-September 2020. From a methods perspective, we replace the VAR models
used in our previous study by structural VAR (SVAR) models (Gottschalk, 2001). Added to the
joint dynamics of a set of variables represented by a VAR model, the structural form depicts the
underlying structural relationships, and offers two additional utilities. First, uncorrelated error
terms help in separating out the effects of potential economically unrelated influences in the VAR,
and further, the model allows variables to have a contemporaneous (rather than only immediate)
impact on other variables (Amisano & Giannini, 2012). Using publicly available COVID-19 and
economic data and open-source software packages, as described in the next section, we perform
our analyses and attempt to interpret the results and address their implications and limitations over
the remainder of this paper.
DATASETS AND METHODS
Data Sources

COVID-19 daily and cumulative confirmed case, recoveries, and deaths data were obtained from
the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at
Johns Hopkins University (Dong et al., 2020). Necessary corrections for Indian COVID-19
incidence data were performed based on the crowdsourced initiative COVID-19 India (COVID19 India, 2021). Historical stock market data for the BRICS nations were obtained from the Yahoo
Finance website (Verizon Media, 2020). Historical exchange rate data for the BRICS nations‚Äô
primary currencies were obtained from the Exchange Rates UK data dashboard (Exchange Rates
UK, 2020).
Data Processing Methodology
Our analyses are based on data starting from March 12, 2020, the first day after COVID-19 was
deemed a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Jebril, 2020), since this
announcement was potentially one of the initiators of the global market shock due to COVID-19,
and we used data until September 30, 2020 (ùëõ = 203). The alignment and clean-up of the COVID19 and economic data were performed using R 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2019). Three COVID-19
variables (cumulative counts of confirmed, deceased, and recovered cases) and two economic
variables (exchange rate with respect to US dollar, and stock market index) were used for the
analyses. Each variable was converted into day-to-day growth rates first (for a variable ùëã, growth
rate for day ùë° is computed as ùê∫+, = 100 √ó

,/ 0,/12
,/12

), and then these growth rates were normalized

using the R function scale to ensure balanced and reliable model fits and comparable magnitude
of the estimates. The five final variables were respectively called GrowthC, GrowthD, GrowthR,
GrowthER, and GrowthSV.
Implementation and Summarization of SVAR Models

The SVAR analyses were performed using the svars and vars packages in R (Lange et al., 2019;
Pfaff, 2008). Alongside the five variables already defined, an adjustment variable for the countryspecific effects not included in our data was included (categorical with five levels, included as an
exogenous variable). Choices of optimal lag using the VARselect function were obtained as 2 days
(Schwarz Criterion), 7 days (Hannan Quinn Criterion), and 13 days (Akaike Information Criterion
and Final Prediction Error). We fit a model with each of these lag choices to identify any variation
in the shock response patterns. The final SVAR models were fit using the id.ngml function utilizing
the non-Gaussian maximum likelihood procedure, since visual inspection of the variables
indicated deviation from normality (Lanne et al., 2017). Impulse response plots were created using
the irf function.
RESULTS
Figure 1 indicates that all three COVID growth variables were initially higher among all the
BRICS nations except China, which is intuitive since at the beginning of our data, China already
had a large cumulative number of cases unlike the others. GrowthER remained erratic throughout
the period considered, with South Africa and China experiencing higher scales of fluctuation than
the others. On the other hand, the fluctuation in GrowthSV was relatively higher for Brazil and
South Africa, while it was relatively milder for China. India initially experienced higher
fluctuation, which later got milder.

the principal 3 √ó 3 submatrix summarizes the associations within the COVID variables, and the
2 √ó 2 submatrix diagonal to it summarizes those within the economic variables. Since we are
primarily interested in the effect of COVID variables on the economic variables, we will focus
mostly on the (bottom-left) 2 √ó 3 submatrices summarizing these effects for the rest of this section.

Figure 4: Impulse response functions for the structural vector autoregressive model with lag
13. The variable acronyms are defined in the methods section.
Across the three different choices of lag, it can be observed that the absolute length of the deviation
from zero due to the shock is more or less similar, and the only feature that differs among these
three scenarios are the erratic patterns of the fluctuations captured within that timeframe (Figures

2-4). This is expected since higher lag length allows the model to capture the changes over time at
a more granular level. With a few exceptions, the GrowthC and GrowthD variables appear to
induce higher absolute magnitudes of shock to the economic variables than those induced by
GrowthR (Figures 2-4).
For GrowthER, the shock duration lies somewhere around 10 days across all three models from
all three COVID variables, with the post-10 days shocks being very close to zero in magnitude, as
captured in Figures 3-4. For GrowthSV, except for the case of lag 2 with GrowthR and GrowthD,
the shock duration appears to be relatively larger with stability being reobtained at around 15 days
or more, as can be observed in Figures 3-4. We performed further exploratory analyses using
possibly higher choices of lag such as 21 and 28 days and visualized the results for higher than 20
units of impulse response horizon (not included here). The resulting estimated response timeframes
did not appear to change significantly from those presented here, validating the estimations in these
models and indicating that our optimal lag-based models did not tend to underestimate the impulse
response durations by too much. We also did not plot the confidence bands associated with these
curves since they were quite sharp (as we had ùëõ = 203 days‚Äô worth of data) and would not
effectively change the inferences presented here based just on the estimated impulse response
curves.
DISCUSSIONS
The impact of COVID-19 on economic indicators and the post-COVID economic scenario of the
developing nations pose an intriguing set of questions before current researchers, and this paper
offers an amalgamation of these two research interests in context of BRICS nations using structural
variable autoregression models to identify underlying associations among COVID and economic
variables. Our models successfully captured the contemporaneous nature of the COVID shock

response of the exchange rate and stock market variables, indicating around one and a half to two
weeks of return windows. While direct validation of these results based on recent literature is
challenging given that most of the research on COVID-19 in BRICS countries have focused on
instantaneous or average effect estimations (Al-Awadhi et al., 2020; Dash et al., 2021) instead of
dynamic or time-varying effects, our results align with results from other studies based on the
impact of COVID-19 on other economic indicators (e.g. crude oil prices) in other developing and
developed parts of the world (Gil-Alana & Monge, 2020; Khurshid & Khan, 2021; Sharif et al.,
2020).
The strength of this study stems from several of its methodological features. First of all, our
analyses are based on a large sample (ùëõ = 203 days) and the confidence intervals/bands associated
with the estimated coefficients turned out to be extremely precise. The usage of normalized growth
variables allows the models to be more stable and the estimates to be less pathological and more
reliable. The non-Gaussian maximum likelihood-based model fitting procedure ensures that our
results are not impacted by mistaken assumptions, and the four different criteria used for lag
estimation ensure a broad coverage of the impact spectrum. The inclusion of the categorical
exogenous variable adjusting for country-level variations adjusts for inherent differences among
the five economies not otherwise captured in our data. One limitation of our approach is in that the
data, although a time series, is observational in nature, and the statistical methodology used only
looks for associations among the variables ‚Äì thereby not allowing us to make causal statements.
Some recent literature have been focused on usage of methods that can establish causal links
between COVID-19 and socio-economic variables, and application of such methods in context of
BRICS nations offer a potential window for future research (Mele & Magazzino, 2021).

Evidences confirming the impact of COVID-19 on economic indicators offer a valuable
information bucket for the policymakers. Governmental decisions to contain and mitigate the
pandemic automatically impact the financial scenario of a nation, and frameworks like ours which
provide estimates of the magnitude and duration of those impacts allow well-informed and planned
implementations of such decisions. The dynamic nature of the models allows them to be updated
with new incoming data, thus providing a continuous stream of literate guidance for policymaking.
