Abstract
This paper presents a data-based simple model for fitting the available data
of the Covid-19 pandemic evolution in France. The time series concerning the
13 regions of mainland France have been considered for fitting and validating the
model. An extremely simple, two-dimensional model with only two parameters
demonstrated to be able to reproduce the time series concerning the number of
daily demises caused by Covid-19, the hospitalizations, intensive care and emergency accesses, the daily number of positive test and other indicators, for the
different French regions. These results might contribute to stimulate a debate on
the suitability of much more complex models for reproducing and forecasting the
pandemic evolution since, although relevant from a mechanistic point of view,
they could lead to nonidentifiability issues.

1. Introduction
The Covid-19 pandemic spread affecting the whole world, causing several
millions of infected cases and thousands of deaths, attracted huge efforts of researchers from different scientific fields aiming at a better understanding of the
virus evolution features. Besides the epidemiologists and the medical researchers,
also the data scientists and the automatic control community mobilize, one of the
major issue being the inference and identification of the dynamical system ruling
the pandemic evolution. The virus evolution dynamics knowledge, in fact, would
allow to estimate the pandemic state and predict its future evolution and thus serve
as modelling tool to infer the effects of the containment measures and support the
health institutions choices. A recent survey, [1] offers a detailed overview on the
Preprint submitted to Annual Reviews in Control

July 23, 2020

recent scientific publications regarding modelling, forecasting and controlling the
evolution of Covid-19 pandemic based on data science and control theory.
Among the simpler and more popular epidemic compartmental models, recently used for fitting the data of the spread of Covid-19, there are the SIR model,
first formulated in the seminar work [2], and the SEIR model [3, 4, 5]. The SIR
model consists in simple differential equations representing the interaction between the populations of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, whereas,
the SEIR models, considers also the population of exposed individuals, for modelling the incubation period. Variations are presented in the literature to take into
account other populations involved in the Covid-19 epidemic disease evolution,
for instance in [6, 7, 8] that included also the asymptomatic individuals, and [9, 10]
that introduces the SIDARTHE model, compartmental Covid-19 model composed
by 8 populations and 16 parameters. Also spatial models [11], to model the geographical interconnection between regions, and network models [12] to represent
the social interaction between individuals and populations, have been formulated
to reproduce the epidemic evolution. Also data-based, model-free models have
been proposed to predict the Covid-19 spread evolution, [13].
Besides non-parametric approaches for model inference, [14, 18] for instance,
parametric model identification has been widely used. The problem of parametric identification for fitting the model with the available data is strongly affected
by several issues, such that the time variation of the parameters [15], the lack of
full access to the data concerning the populations [16], the presence of uncertainties affecting the model [17, 3]. These sources of uncertainties and lack of exact
knowledge may lead to the issue of nonidentifiability [18], that consists in practice in the existence of different sets of parameters that permits to reproduce the
available data. When this occurs, it is not possible to univocally identify the real
set of parameters, and then to discriminate them from all the other potential solutions of the identification problem. The consequence might be a low accuracy
and a poor forecasting power of the identified model. The use of simple models
[19, 18, 20] and the validation of the identified system on several sets of data [21],
from different regions for instance, are possible solutions to the nonidentifiability
issue.
This paper is guided by the Ockham’s razor, or law of parsimony, criterion,
which substantially claims that the simplest solution is most likely the right one
since based on less hypotheses. As stated above for the nonidentifiability problem,
2

indeed, the simpler is the model able to fit and reproduce the available data, the
higher is its reliability in terms of accuracy and forecasting power. Starting from
the available data concerning the Covid-19 pandemic evolution in the 13 regions
of mainland France, an extremely simple dynamical model has been formulated
with only two states and two parameters, common to all the regions. The model
has been identified on the measures of deaths caused by the Covid-19 and then
validated on several other time series, concerning hospitalizations, intensive care
accesses, emergency admissions etc. for all the 13 regions.
The paper is organized as follows: Section2 presents the time series concerning the excess of deaths due to Covid-19, used to identify the model; Section 3
deals with the model and its fitting to deaths excess data; Section 4 regards the
validation of the identified model on other times series. The paper terminates with
some conclusions.
2. Deaths excess data for fitting
Several datasets concerning the evolution of the Covid-19 in France are available that can be used to identify the dynamics parameters. The data are organized
by gender, by department, by age and by region. In this work focuses on the dynamics of the Covid-19 evolution within the different regions of mainland France,
aiming at identifying a single model, as simple as possible, that permits to fit and
reproduce the regional evolution of Covid-19 pandemic.
Concerning the number of demises due to the Covid-19, in particular, three
time series are available. Firstly, the INSEE, the French National Institute of
Statistics and Economic Studies, provides the data of all the daily demises occurred since January 1, 2018, in a single file, organized by region, in [22]. In
Fig 1 the evolution of deaths in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, concerning the
years 2018, 2019 and 2020 are represented. Besides the time series, the smoothed
series, computed by averaging over a 14-days-long window, are drown in bold,
together with the average of values of 2018 and 2019. The data concerning the 13
regions of mainland France are shown in Appendix A.
A measure of the daily deaths for Covid-19 is the difference between the daily
demises occurred in 2020 and the average of those of 2018 and 2019. This difference, in fact, is supposed to represent (via some correction that are mentioned

3

in the sequel) the excess of deaths occurred in the period of Covid-19 pandemic
spread in France and can be supposed to be the effect of the epidemic.

Other two time series are available that represent measures of the demises
caused by the Covid-19, in particular the number of deaths registered at the hospitals, incid_dc and the number of demises that have been electronically registered and transmitted to the Inserm1 institute. More details on these two time
series can be found in Section 4. For obtaining a reasonably reliable guess of the
number of deaths caused by Covid-19, these two signals have been smoothed by
averaging them over a 14-days-long time window.
The time series considered for model fitting, depicted in Fig. 2 for AuvergneRhône-Alpes region (see Appendix B for the other regions), are:
• the excess of deaths of 2020 with respect to the average of 2018 and 2019,
averaged over a 14-days-long window, denoted mean excess20;
• the average over a 14-days-long window of hospital demises time series
incid_dc, denoted mean incid_dc;

Inserm, averaged over a 14-days-long window, in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.

From the inspection of Fig. 2, and considering the excess of deaths of 2020 as
a reliable measure of the real amount of demises caused by Covid-19, it can be
inferred that:
• the cases registered in the hospitals and those certified to Inserm represent
a sub-estimation of the real number of demises due to Covid-19 in the first
weeks after the lockdown of March 17;
• the pandemic in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes might have been starting at the beginning of March, as the curve, although at negative values (i.e. deaths in
2020 below the average of 2018/2019), presents an exponentially increasing
behavior since the first days of March;
• the lockdown might have affected also the other causes of mortality (for instance due to the traffic reduction, working activity partial stop, etc.) leading
to values of excess around 0 in the last week of April and in May, when the
5

certified demises, both in hospitals and through electronic certification, are
higher than the mortality excess.
The last consideration, in particular, seems to indicate that the mortality excess
of 2020 represents an underestimation of cases of demises due to Covid-19, particularly in the last part of the period taken into account. To compensate this effect,
that can be observed in the data concerning many of the mainland France regions,
see the Appendix C, an heuristic criterion has been employed, to avoid that the
time series considered as a reliable measure of the deaths caused by Covid-19 is
lower than the number of observed cases.
In particular, a linear function of the time has been added to the time series
mean excess20 and the maximum between it and the signal mean incid_dc
is taken. The resulting time series mean excess20 corr in Fig 3 has been
employed to identify the system.

3. Model fitting the deaths excess
A first hypothesis is formulated to express the fact that the demises caused by
Covid-19 is proportional to the number of infected individuals.

6

Assumption 1. The number of daily deaths due to Covid-19 is proportional to
the number of infected individuals.
Consider the dynamics relating the number of Covid-19 deaths and the number
of infected cases employed in several epidemiological compartmental models:
dD(t)
= α I(t).
(1)
dt
Assumption 1 is equivalent to suppose satisfaction of (1), often employed in
the compartmental epidemic models, and then that the number of new demises
for Covid-19 is proportional to the value of the infected cases, with proportionality coefficient α . Thus, a reliable measure of the daily demises would provide a
scaled image of the Covid-19 infected cases.
Moreover, as a second hypothesis, the resulting signal mean excess20
corr in Fig. 2 is considered hereafter as a reasonably reliable guess of the amount
of daily demises due to Covid-19 infection.
Assumption 2. The time series mean excess20 corr, denoted f (t), is a reliable measure of the number of daily demises caused by Covid-19.
Under these assumptions, then, f (t) is a measured approximation of the value
of the function α I(t), from (1), in fact:
dD(t)
(2)
= α I(t) ≃ f (t).
dt
Given the time series f (t) that represents the evolution of the population of
Covid-19 infected individuals, multiplied by an known constant α , its dynamics
can be identified.
The simpler epidemic compartmental models, yet considered among the most
robust from the information theory point of view, see [19, 1], is the SIR model.
The SIR model, and its variation SEIR, have been recently used for fitting the
spread of Covid-19 [3, 4, 5]. In SIR (or SIRD) models, the populations of susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R) and dead (D) individuals (often the recovered
7

and dead individuals are considered in a single compartment R) are modeled by
the differential equations:
dS
= −β IS
dt
dI
= β IS − γ I − α I
dt
dR
= γI
dt
dD
= αI
dt
(3)

To pursue the aim of fitting the data with simple model, though, consider the
evolution of the state variable defined as f (t) in (2). From f (t) = α I(t) and the
dynamics of I(t) in (3), then
d f (t)
= β (t) f (t)S(t) − γ f (t) − α f (t) = δ (t) f (t)
dt

(4)

with δ (t) = β (t)S(t) − γ − α . Note that β (t), that is the coefficient of the rate
of infection, has been considered time-varying. In fact, the variation of susceptible individuals, i.e. the whole region population (more than 8 million people in
Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes ) at the beginning of the pandemic, might not be the cause
of the excess of deaths drastic decreasing. This demises drop should most likely
be caused by the containment measures, the lockdown in particular, that reduced
the rate of infection.
Concerning, the evolution of δ (t), related to the reproduction number, a first
analysis of the data showed a behavior typical of first order non-autonomous linear systems, evolving exponentially from positive values at the beginning of the
pandemic expansion to negative ones during its decreasing. Thus, denoting with

8

• F the set of indices of the 13 regions of mainland France2 ;
• fi (t) the time series of the corrected excess of deaths in 2020, obtained as
illustrated above, for the i-th region with i ∈ F;
• δi (t) the parameter of equation (4), for the i-th region with i ∈ F;
we shall prove that the following simple two-parameter model can quite nicely
accounts for the measurements concerning the 13 regions in the mainland France:

d fi (t)
= δi (t) fi(t)
dt
d δi (t)
= aδi (t) + u
dt
(5)

for every region i, with two common parameters, a and u. The objective of the
identification is to find the optimal values of a and u, common to the dynamical
systems of all the 13 regions of mainland France, and the initial conditions fi (t0)
and δi (t0), for every i-th region, such that the simulation of (5) fits the signal mean
excess20 corr.
Hence, denoting:
• k0 the initial day of the identification interval, i.e. the lockdown date of
March 17th;

(11), Grand Est (44), Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (84), Hauts-de-France (32),

Loire (52), Centre-Val de Loire (24), Bretagne (53), Normandie (28), Nouvelle-Aquitaine (75)
and Corse (94)

• k f the final day of the identification interval, April 28th;
the following problem is posed:

∑ ∑ qi( fˆi(k) − fi(k))2

s.t. fˆi (k + 1) = (1 + δi (k)) fˆi (k),
δi (k + 1) = (1 + a)δi (k) + u,
fˆi (k0 ) = fˆi,0 ,
∀i ∈ F,

δi (k0 ) = δi,0 ,

∀k0 ≤ k ≤ k f , ∀i ∈ F,
∀k0 ≤ k ≤ k f , ∀i ∈ F,

∀i ∈ F.
(6)

Problem (6) is a least-squared minimization problem with nonconvex constraints and 28 variables, that are:
• the two parameters a and u;
• the 26 initial conditions fˆi,0 and δi,0 , with i ∈ F, for the 13 regions.
Parameters qi are chosen to appropriately weight the errors of regions with
different values of excess of deaths in 2020.
To solve the nonconvex problem (6), first an initial suboptimal solution has
been obtained by solving a convex problem involving only the dynamics of δi ,
with variables a, u and δi,0 . This solution, together with an ad-hoc selection of
fˆi,0 , has been used as initial condition of the nonconvex optimization problem. In
particular, the Torczon algorithm has been employed, that is a derivative free nonconvex optimization algorithm and whose python implementation can be found at
[23].

The optimal values for the parameters a and u in (5) obtained are
a = −7.1139 · 10−2,

u = −6.2489 · 10−3,

(7)

and the optimal initial conditions are given in Table 1. Notice the initial condition of fi for the two regions most affected by the Covid-19 spread, i.e. Île-deFrance (11) and Grand Est (44), are around 40 units, much higher than those of
the other regions.

that the y axis in all the figures ranges between 0 and 200, except Île-de-France

3.1. Discussion on identifiability and forecast
Although the model that proved to reproduce the evolution of the Covid-19
spread in the 13 French regions is extremely simple, with only two parameters
and two states, the system involving the infected cases is nonidentifiable. In fact,
it is easy to see that every pair of time series Ii (t) and parameter α such that
fi (t) = α Ii (t)

for the i ∈ F region, leads to the same trajectory of system (5). Then, from the
observation of the 2020 deaths access only it is not possible to identify the real
value of α and, then, at the same time the time series of the infected population.

15

The perspective is even worse for what concerns the forecast power of system (5). Indeed, the state evolution depends on the value of δi (t), that can be
seen as a time-varying parameter. In the case under analysis, its evolution, caused
most likely by the containment measures, the lockdown application and the people habits adaptation, has been identified with satisfactory precision. This would
imply, then, that the effect of complete lockdown seems to be modelled by the
specific values of a and u, resulting from the optimization process. On the other
hand, it is not clear how to predict the future evolution of δi (t) for i ∈ F, whose
knowledge is unavoidable to forecast the evolution of the number of demises due
to the pandemic. Further knowledge, on historic data, epidemiology and clinical
data, as done for influenza pandemic for instance [24], might help to achieve this
crucial task.

4. Model validation on further data
In the previous sections, the model has been fitted with the data regarding the
daily deaths that can be considered as consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic.
As several other datasets are available from gouvernamental sources, though, that
might be related to the pandemic evolution, we aim at check whether simple relations between these data and the identified model exist. In the affirmative case,
this would validate the fitted model.
As said above, many time series regarding the Covid-19 daily evolution in
France are available. In particular, in [25], the daily data on the Covid-19 can be
found, between mid-March and mid-June 2020, regarding:
• the number of new hospitalizations, signal incid_hosp;
• the number of patients entering the intensive care services, denoted incid_rea;
• the number of patient demises, incid_dc;
• and the number of recovered patients, incid_rad.

16

Fig. 8 shows the evolution of the time series in the region Auvergne-RhôneAlpes, in thin lines the data from the files are depicted, while in bold the signals
smoothed by averaging the values over 5 days are drown.
Moreover, Fig.8 shows also the time series, [26], of the deaths for Covid19 that have been electronically certified by the CepiDc laboratory, which is the
Inserm laboratory in charge of elaborating the statistics regarding the medical
demises. This time series, denoted incid_inserm in Fig. 8, concerns the
deaths occurred in public or private hospitals, nursing homes, or other places,
that have been electronically registered. This time series considers also part of the
cases included in incid_dc. Recall that the average of time series incid_dc
and incid_inserm have been employed in the definition of the signal mean
excess20 corr, on which the model has been fitted, also see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.

At the site [28], files are available reporting, for every French region and every
day since mid-February, the data concerning the accesses to the hospital emergency services and the activity of SOS Médecins, an association of doctors providing emergency assistance. In particular, the data series regard:
• the overall number of admissions to hospital emergency services,
nbre_pass_tot;
• the number of admissions to emergency for presumed Covid-19 cases,
nbre_pass_corona;
• the number of hospitalizations among the admissions to emergency for presumed Covid-19 cases, nbre_hospit_corona;
• the overall number of medical acts of SOS Médecins, nbre_act_tot;
• the number of medical acts of SOS Médecins of presumed Covid-19 cases,
nbre_act_corona.

18

As can be noticed in Fig 10, the number of admissions to emergency and the
SOS Médecins, in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, dropped around the middle of
March, when the Covid-19 epidemic spread started in France and the lockdown
was imposed by the French health authorities, on March 17. Nevertheless, as
can be remarked from Fig 10, the number of presumed or overt Covid-19 cases
started consistently growing at the same time in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.
Analogous data evolution can be observed in several French regions, where the
Covid-19 pandemic spread relevantly.

Figure 10: Daily evolution of: admissions to emergency, nbre_pass_tot; admissions to emergency for Covid-19, nbre_pass_corona; hospitalizations among the admissions to emergency
for Covid-19, nbre_hospit_corona; medical acts of SOS Médecins, nbre_act_tot;
medical acts of SOS Médecins of Covid-19 cases, nbre_act_corona. In bold, the average
over a 5-days-long window.

Consider here the i-th region, the index is omitted for notation simplicity. Suppose that the number of hospitalizations, that is the time series incid_hosp in
Fig. 8 denoted here as H(t), is proportional to the number of infected individuals
at a previous instant:

H(t) = µ f (t − η ).

The time series f (t) being known, parameters µ and η can be identified by
simple least-squared minimization, repeated for different values of η . The same
19

can be done for the other time series illustrated in Section 2, that is
• new hospitalizations, incid_hosp;
• new intensive cares patients, incid_rea;
• daily patient demises, incid_dc;
• recovered patients, incid_rad,
• positive tested cases, pos,
• daily demises certified to Inserm, incid_inserm,
• admissions to emergency for presumed Covid-19 cases, nbre_pass_corona
(denoted pass_corona in the tables);
• new hospitalizations among the admissions to emergency for presumed Covid19 cases, nbre_hospit_corona (denoted hospit_corona in the tables);
• medical acts of SOS Médecins of presumed Covid-19 cases, nbre_act_corona
(denoted act_corona in the tables)
The results of the fitting for the three regions that experienced the most relevant pandemic spread, i.e. Île-de-France (11), Grand Est (44) and AuvergneRhône-Alpes (84) are shown in Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, respectively, those concerning the other regions can be found in Appendix D.

20

The optimal values of parameters η and µ for the three regions are given in
Tables 2 and 3. It can be noticed that the curves of the excess of deaths are reproduced, scaled and shifted in time, in the measured time series. A coherent
sequence of event could be inferred from the values of η . It seems, in fact, that
the peak of SOS Médecins acts occurred first, followed three days later by the
peaks at the emergency services; then the peaks at intensive care units happened
followed by the peaks of hospitalizations. Afterward, the peak of the excess of
deaths, i.e. of fi , occurred, while the peaks of the deaths registered at hospitals
and by Inserm came, few days later. Finally, the curve of recovered patients arrived.
It is also interesting to note that, while the temporal sequence are substantially the same for Île-de-France (11) and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (84), in Grand
Est (44) region, where the most important and early Covid-19 cluster revealed,
the events appear to be compressed in time, the peaks at the emergency units, for
SOS Médecins and for positive test occurred around 5 days before than the other
two regions.
Moreover, from the comparison between the values of µ parameters, that are
the proportionality coefficients between the evolution of excess of deaths and the
considered time series, interesting informations can be recovered, in particular on
the degree of stress and saturation of the regional health systems. Considering
for instance the acts of SOS Médecins, while there have been almost 2 acts for
every demise of Covid-19 in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes , in Grand Est the number
of deaths have been higher than the capability of the institution diagnosis, while
in Île-de-France the number of demises seems to be more than the double of the
SOS Médecins acts. Analogous conclusions can be drawn by other indicators:
the activity of the emergency units (pass_corona and hospit_corona);
the number of positive test; the hospitalization and intensive care accesses, in
the three regions. It appear evident the degree of overwhelming saturation of the
health systems of Grand Est and, even more dramatically, of Île-de-France region.

5. Conclusions
In this paper, the available data concerning the Covid-19 spread in the 13 different regions of mainland France have been considered to build and identify a
dynamical model. The aim was to fit the data with a model as simple as possible,
to prevent and overcome the possible problem of nonidentifiability. An extremely
simple dynamical system, with two states and only two common parameters for
all the regions, permitted to reproduce the considered time series, that are the
data concerning hospitalizations, intensive cares accesses, emergency and SOS
Médecins activity, Covid-19 testing. These results seem to indicate that, with the
available data only, more complex epidemiological models might incur in nonidentifiability and raise issues on their forecasting power. Exploiting additional
data and further knowledge could be a solution to this problem.
