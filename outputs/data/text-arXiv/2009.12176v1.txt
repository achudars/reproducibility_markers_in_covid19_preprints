Abstract—Millions of people have been infected and lakhs of
people have lost their lives due to the worldwide ongoing novel
Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. It is of utmost importance
to identify the future infected cases and the virus spread rate for
advance preparation in the healthcare services to avoid deaths.
Accurately forecasting the spread of COVID-19 is an analytical
and challenging real-world problem to the research community.
Therefore, we use day level information of COVID-19 spread
for cumulative cases from whole world and 10 mostly affected
countries; US, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Russia, Iran,
United Kingdom, Turkey, and India. We utilize the temporal data
of coronavirus spread from January 22, 2020 to May 20, 2020.
We model the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, and perform
prediction using ARIMA and Prophet time series forecasting
models. Effectiveness of the models are evaluated based on
the mean absolute error, root mean square error, root relative
squared error, and mean absolute percentage error. Our analysis
can help in understanding the trends of the disease outbreak, and
provide epidemiological stage information of adopted countries.
Our investigations show that ARIMA model is more effective for
forecasting COVID-19 prevalence. The forecasting results have
potential to assist governments to plan policies to contain the
spread of the virus.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected millions of
people worldwide since it emerged from China in December
2019. COVID-19 has very high mutating capability, and it can
spread very easily. Infected people from this virus suffer from
severe respiratory problems, and may develop serious illness
if suffering from chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease
or diabetes or having weak immune system or being older
in age [14]. World health organization (WHO) declared on
11th March, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic.
There are challenges to contain the disease because an infected
person shows symptom after a long time or no sign of the
disease. At present, no vaccination has been discovered for
COVID-19. In this situation, social distancing, identifying the
positive cases using testing at large scale, and containment of
infected person is the only option to prevent the spreading of
the virus [6].

The spread of COVID-19 can be classified [8] under three
major stages- 1. Local outbreak: at this stage, spreading chain
of the virus among the people can be tracked, and the source
of infection can be found out. The cases in this stage mostly
relate to within family or friends, or the local exposure. 2.
Community transmission: at this stage, source of the chain of
infected people cannot be found out. The infected cases grow
through cluster transmission in the communities. 3. Large scale
transmission: at this stage, the virus spreads rapidly to other
regions of a country due to uncontrolled mobility of people at
large scale.
Due to high scale community impact and easy spreading
worldwide, national governments imposed lockdown to control
the spread of corona virus. As of 20th May, 2020, 4996472
cases have been confirmed, 1897466 cases have recovered,
2328115 deaths have been reported, and 2770891 active cases
have been identified worldwide. The statistical data is collected
from [4], and the number of COVID-19 cases is calculated
between 22 Jan, 2020 to 20 May 2020.
As no vaccine has been discovered of the disease, so
motivation behind this paper is to model spreading of the
corona virus, and predict the impact to optimize the planning to manage the various services and resources for the
public by the governments. Some of the studies [10], [12],
[13], [17] have been published showing statistical analysis,
modeling, and artificial intelligence to contain the spread
of the virus, and highlight impacts in coming days. These
early studies are carried out using very limited information
available at early stage of the outbreak. Now, the virus has
spread at large scale, and much information is available for
the analysis. Predictive analysis of COVID-19 has become a
hot research area to support health services and governments
to plan and contain the spread of the infectious disease [3].
Modeling and forecasting the daily spread behavior of the
virus can assist the health systems to be ready to accommodate
the upcoming number of patients. Accurate forecasting of
the disease is a matter of concern because it may impact
governments policy, containment rules, health system, and
social life. Regarding this context, we explore the predictive

capability of the ARIMA [16], and Prophet [15] forecasting
models. The models are widely used and accepted due to
their more accurate forecasting capability. We use the day
level cumulative cases of COVID-19 worldwide and 10 mostly
affected countries; US, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Russia,
Iran, United Kingdom, Turkey, and India for our analysis
study.
The objective of this paper is to provide evaluative study of
prediction models using COVID-19 cases, and forecasting the
impact of the virus in the affected countries, and worldwide.
We present trend analysis of COVID-19 cases, and compared
the performance of the models using the metrics such as the
mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE),
root relative squared error (RRSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). We generate forecasting results for
COVID-19 confirmed, active, recovered, and death cases. The
results show that ARIMA outperformed the Prophet model.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II presents a literature survey. Section III provides trend
analysis of COVID-19 cases. Section IV describes overview
of time series forecasting models. Modeling framework and
used COVID-19 dataset are described in section V. Statistical
analysis and model evolution are presented in section VI.
Section VII concludes the paper.
II. L ITERATURE SURVEY
Intensive research work is going on to evaluate and contain
the worldwide disaster of COVID-19 on the human race.
Research studies include predictions about the future cases
[17], and analysis of the variables responsible for spread of
the coronavirus [11].
In the literature, time series forecasting problems have
been studied widely in which COVID-19 forecasting is an
emerging problem. Forecasting models can be used to forecast
the impact of the disease on the community which can help
to control the epidemic. In [13], authors have performed
forecasting evaluation study of the models using COVID-19
day level cases from 10 mostly affected states from Brazil.
According to the authors, the stacking ensemble and SVR
performed better as compared to ARIMA, CUBIST, RIDGE,
and RF models for the adopted criteria. In [5], the author
has developed ARIMA(p,d,q) model and studied the COVID19 epidemiological trend in the three most affected countries;
Spain, Italy, and France of Europe continent using the data
between 21 Feb to 15 April 2020. The author studied the
various orders (p, d, q) of the model, and selected best performing order based on lowest values of MAPE for the three
countries. He has suggested that ARIMA models are suitable
for forecasting the COVID-19 prevalence for the upcoming
days. Chintalapudi et al. [2], adopted seasonal ARIMA model
for forecasting of COVID-19 cases in Italy using the data
till 31st March 2020. They have analysed the impact of two
months lockdown in Italy, and observed decrement in the
confirmed cases and growth in the recovered cases due to
lockdown. Alabi et al. [1] have adopted the Facebook Prophet
model to forecast spread of COVID-19. They have performed

prediction for confirmed and death cases. Their forecasting
accuracy of Prophet was 79.6% for the data from WHO
between 7th April to 3rd May 2020. Parikshit et al. [9] have
presented medical perspective of COVID-19, and prediction
using Prophet model. They have recommended Prophet for
prediction due to open source algorithm, accuracy, and faster
data fitting. Using the Prophet model, they have predicted
infected cases worldwide as 1.6 million by the end of May
2020, and 2.3 million by the end of June 2020.
III. COVID-19 T RENDS
We have collected cumulative day level data of COVID19 cases from github repository [7] latest by 20 May, 2020.
The repository is supported by ESRI living atlas team, Applied
Physics Lab (APL), and maintained by the Center for Systems
Science and Engineering (CSSE), both at Johns Hopkins
University, USA. The repository contains worldwide COVID19 reported cases starting from 22 January, 2020 on day-today basis. We study COVID-19 confirmed cases, recovered
cases, death cases, and active cases for 10 adopted countries
and worldwide. The adopted countries are the badly affected
countries by the virus in the world latest by 20 May, 2020.
The impact of coronavirus in 10 adopted countries from 1st
March, 2020 to 20th May, 2020 is shown in Fig. 1. Trends
of confirmed, recovered, deaths, and active cases in adopted
countries show that impact of the virus from highest to lowest
is in the sequence of labeling order of the countries. The figure
clearly shows that US is the most affected country, it has
highest confirmed and death cases. Except US and Russia,
other countries are able to flatten the graphs after some level
of outbreak.

cases of COVID-19 in adopted countries.
Fig. 2 shows worldwide spread trend of coronavirus from 22
January, 2020 to 20 May, 2020. The trend explains that growth
of the virus is almost exponential after mid-March 2020.
Fig. 3 shows recovery rate of COVID-19 in the adopted
countries and worldwide from 22 Jan 2020 to 20 May 2020.
From the figure, we can say that highest recovery is done by

Fig. 2: Trend of COVID-19 cases worldwide.

Iran whereas Turkey shows exponential growth in the recovery
cases, and other countries follows the recovery pattern similar
to growth pattern of confirmed cases. Various studies [6],
[14], [17] show that the disease recovers automatically after
sometime but causes major health problem which can lead to
death, if not taken care.

A. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
ARIMA(p,d,q) [16] is composite of Autoregressive (AR)
model, Moving Average (MA) model, and 'I' stands for integration; where p is order of autoregression, d is order of
differencing, q is order of moving average.
The AR(p) model is defined as a linear process given as the
following equation.

zt = α + φ1 zt−1 + φ2 zt−2 + ... + φp zt−p + wt

(1)

where zt−1 , zt−2 , zt−p are the lags (past values);
φ1 , φ2 , ...φp are lag coefficients which are estimated by
the model; wt is the white noise, and α is defined as follows.

Fig. 4 shows fatality rate of COVID-19 patients worldwide
and in adopted countries from 22 Jan 2020 to 20 May 2020.
The figure shows that Iran faced highest death rate which was
later over taken by US along with France. Spain has also
shown significant death rate over the period of time. Other
countries were able to control deaths to some extent using
lockdowns or following social distancing etc. The virus has
taken lives of many people worldwide.
The historical data depicts that the COVID-19 badly affected the countries which do not impose lockdowns or do
not followed social distancing. Some variations in virus spread
rate, recovery rate, and death rate can be seen in different
countries based on population density, available health system
in a country, testing capability, and action taken to contain the
outbreak.

where µ is mean of the process.
The MA(q) model is defined as the following equation.

zt = α + wt + θ1 wt−1 + θ2 wt−2 + ... + θq wt−q

(3)

Where wt , wt−1 , ..wt−q are error terms of the model for the
respective lags i.e. zt , zt−1 , ...zt−q .
ARIMA is able to fit if the data is stationary i.e. data mean
and standard deviation is constant. The differencing parameter
d is the order of transformation to make dataset stationary.
Second order differencing is shown in the following equation.

zt = (Zt − Zt−1 )−(Zt−1 − Zt−2 ) = Zt −2Zt−1 +Zt−2 (4)

IV. T IME S ERIES FORECASTING MODELS
Time series forecasting models are used to predict the
futuristic outcomes based on historical information. We have
adopted ARIMA and Facebook Prophet (FBProphet) model
in our evaluative and forecasting study. An overview of the
models is given in the following sections.

Finally the equation for the ARIMA(p,d,q) is defined as
follows.

B. Facebook Prophet

B. Forecasting Framework

Taylor et al. [15] proposed the Facebook Prophet
(FBProphet) which uses several non-linear and linear methods
as components with time as a regressor. Prophet is developed
and released as open source software by data science team of
Facebook. The model ignores the temporal dependence of the
data, and training is framed just as curve-fitting exercise. So,
irregular observations are also allowed in a dataset. The model
offers various advantages like it can accommodate multiple
period seasonality; it can accommodate custom and known
holidays; it provides flexibility by offering two options for
trend: 1. a piecewise linear model, 2. a saturating growth
model; and the model fits very fast. The model includes one
more term holidays as the components of time series, so a
time series can be defined by the following equation.

Fig. 5 describes about the adopted framework for prediction
and analysis of the COVID-19 cases using ARIMA, and
FBProphet models. For the analysis, we have split the datasets
of confirmed, active, recovered, and death cases into training
and testing. We performed prediction after removing trends
wherever applicable, and used statistical measures to evaluate
the performance.

zt = Tt + St + Ht + t

(6)

where Tt is trend, St is seasonality, Ht is holiday, and t
is error term.
V. DATASET AND F ORECASTING FRAMEWORK
This section describes about the dataset we have used to
forecast COVID-19 cases of adopted countries, and worldwide. It also describes the modeling framework which we have
followed.

C. Performance Measures

A. Modeling Dataset
It is observed from the trends in section-III that rate of the
reported COVID-19 cases in each country increases with time
and flattens after sometime if large scale testing is performed,
lockdown is imposed, and containment is followed. For our
study, we disaggregated the available day level data of the
adopted 10 countries. We discarded the initial 5 days data for
each country in our study. The reason to discarding the initial
samples is that testing of the samples grows slowly in starting
phase which does not depict the actual rate of the spread. The
utilized samples detail is given in Table I. The end date of the
collected samples is 20 May 2020. In this study, we consider
80 percentage samples for training and 20 percentage samples
for testing the models for each country and worldwide data.

VI. R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The adopted framework is implemented in Python 3.8,
and we have used ARIMA and Prophet models from openly
available packages statsmodels and fbProphet respectively. We
have performed our experiments in Intel Core i5 processor
clocked at 2.40 GHz, 8 GB RAM, and 4GB NVIDIA GTX1650 GPU. In this section, we will discuss about forecasting
accuracy of adopted models for active, recovered, deaths, and
confirmed cases.

A. Forecasting of active cases
Active cases are the number of infected people who are
under medical supervision. Active cases are derived as shown
in the following equation.

Germany
Russia
Iran

Active = Conf irmed − Recovered − Deaths

(11)

We use ARIMA and FBProphet models to predict the future
cases. ARIMA can be used for prediction if data is stationary.
It is clear from the trends in section-III that data of active cases
is not in stationary form. So, we have applied techniques to
convert the data into stationary form for ARIMA evaluation.
We have applied square root scaling and one lag differencing
to convert the data into stationary form. We have performed
dicky-fuller test to check stationarity of the data. We also have
used PACF and ACF plots to identify appropriate values of q
and p order of ARIMA. The FBProphet is applied directly on
actual data. Forecasting accuracy results for active cases of
10 adopted countries and worldwide are shown in Table II.
We have mentioned order of ARIMA along with the accuracy
results in the tables. The mentioned ARIMA order performed
better to fit the model accurately. Best MAPE scores are 0.586
and 1.481 for US and UK data by ARIMA and FBProphet
respectively. From the results, we can clearly say that ARIMA
has far better performance as compared to FBProphet model
with respect to all types of error measures i.e. MAE, RMSE,
RRSE, and MAPE.

UK
Turkey
India

To predict and analyse the recovery rate of the disease, we
have performed evaluative study of the adopted models using
recovery data of the 10 adopted countries, and worldwide.
We can see from the trends in section III that recovery data
is also non-stationary. So, we have performed stationarity
techniques similar to as discussed in section-VI(A) to evaluate
the ARIMA model. We have applied FBProphet directly on
actual data to fit the model and generated the forecasting
results. Table III shows accuracy results of the models for the
recovered cases. Best MAE results are 78.19 and 69.11 for UK
data by ARIMA and FBProphet respectively. Results show that
ARIMA prediction almost matches the actual values whereas
FBProphet did not perform as well. We can see that maximum
MAPE value of ARIMA is 15.6 and minimum value is 2.5
which are very much acceptable to generate forecasting results,
whereas maximum and minimum MAPE for FBProphet are
31.822 and 3.759 respectively.

C. Forecasting of death cases
Coronavirus has taken many lives. So, it is necessary to
analyse the fatality rate of the virus, and forecasting to
highlight future cases which can guide governments to act
in advance. In this section, we have evaluated the forecasting models for death cases of the adopted countries, and
worldwide. We have converted the non-stationary fatality data
into stationary form to fit the ARIMA model similar to as
discussed in section-VI(A). FBProphet model is applied on the
actual data to forecast the prediction results. Table IV shows
prediction accuracy of the models for the fatality cases. We
can see that prediction errors of ARIMA are very less whereas

FBProphet prediction have high error factor in the results. The
results suggest that ARIMA can be used for actual forecasting
of the cases to plan the services accordingly.

and India by both the models ARIMA and FBProphet are
shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 respectively. We have shown
training and testing data split using vertical line in the figures.
Forecasted and actual data are plotted together to visualize
the fitting accuracy of the models. We can see that FBProphet
model is able to fit well in case of US data as shown in Fig. 6
whereas ARIMA is able to perform well in case of India data
as shown in Fig. 7. FBProphet adopts successively progression,
and avoid outliers during modeling and forecasting. The results
also depicts that FBProphet can fit well in case of less data
whereas ARIMA requires sufficient data to model and predict
the results.

D. Forecasting confirmed cases
In this section, we have highlighted the fitted accuracy of
the models using confirmed cases. For this analysis, we have
chosen only two countries; US and India. The results of US

VII. C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE WORK
WHO has declared COVID-19 as pandemic because it has
infected most of the countries, and it is a major threat to human
race. In this paper, we have done analysis and prediction
study of the disease using widely accepted forecasting models;
ARIMA and FBProphet. We have collected COVID-19 data
of 10 highly affected countries US, Spain, Italy, France,
Germany, Russia, Iran, UK, Turkey, India, and worldwide
latest by May 20, 2020. For the most of the countries data,
ARIMA has better performed compared to Prophet on scale
of MAE, RMSE, RRSE, and MAPE error matrices. The
trend analysis shows rapid growth in the infected cases, and
prediction study shows great rise in the expected active,
recovered, and death cases worldwide. However, lockdowns
and containment policies may affect the prediction results. The
adopted models have performed well but it limits our study to
the effectiveness of the models, which can be further improved

using ensemble of multiple prediction models. The obtained
forecasting results further can be improved by taking various
variables into account like population density, weather, health
system, patient history etc. using deep learning techniques, and
artificial intelligence.
