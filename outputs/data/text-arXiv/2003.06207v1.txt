A note on the paper: “Early epidemiological analysis of coronavirus disease 2019
outbreak using crowdsourced data: a population level observational study by Sun,
Chen and Viboud”
Giuseppe Arbia1
Abstract: Crowdsourcing data can prove of paramount importance in monitoring and
controlling the spread of infectious diseases. The recent paper by Sun, Chen and
Viboud (2020) is important because it contributes to the understanding of the
epidemiology and of the spreading of Covid-19 in a period when most of the
epidemic characteristics are still unknown. However, the use of crowdsourcing
data raises a number of problems from the statistical point of view which run the
risk of invalidating the results and of biasing estimation and hypothesis testing.
While the work by Sun, Chen and Viboud (2020) has to be commended, given
the importance of the topic for worldwide health security, in this paper we deem
important to remark the presence of the possible sources of statistical biases and
to point out possible solutions to them.

1. Introduction
The paper by Sun, Chen and Viboud (2020) (henceforth SCV) is an important example of the
use of crowdsourced data in monitoring the spread of COVID-19.
Indeed, crowdsourcing data can prove of paramount importance in monitoring and controlling
the spread of infectious diseases as it is also remarked e. g. by Leung and Leung (2020) among
the many others. The paper relies on an innovative source (potentially obtainable in real time)
derived from social media and news report collected in China from 13th to 31st of January 2020
during the first outbreak of the Corona virus epidemics. The data collected referred to 507
cases. In the paper the crowdsourced data, coming from different sources, are used to estimate
several epidemiological parameters of tremendous importance in the process of surveillance
and control of the diffusion of the disease such as: The relative risk by age group, the mean age
and skewness of infected people, the time of delays between symptoms and seeking care at
hospital, the mean incubation period. SCV also use the crowdsourced data to test theoretical
hypotheses using the Wilcoxon test and the Kruskal–Wallis test 2 These test lead them to
conclude that the delay between symptoms onset and seeking care at hospital or clinic
decreased significantly after January 18th and that the delay was significantly longer in Hubei
with respect to Tianjin and Yunnan and between international travelers and local population.
There are two main statistical problems connected with the use of crowdsourced data in general
and with those presenting a spatial configuration in particular (such as those employed by
SCV), namely:
1. The lack of a precise sample design
2. The presence of spatial/network correlation among the individuals in the sample
We will briefly discuss the two problems in more details in the following two sections.
2. Problems arising from convenience sampling

As is it well known the Wilcoxon test (or the Mann–Whitney U test) is a nonparametric test used to test the hypothesis of equality
between two independent samples. The Kruskal–Wallis test is also non-parametric which extends the Wilcoxon test in comparing two or
more independent samples of equal or different sample sizes and can be also seen as the non-parametric version of the one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA). See Wilcoxon (1945) and Kruskal and Wallis (1952)

A general characteristics of crowdsourced data,, likewise other unconventionally collected Big
Data3, is the lack of any precise sample design (Arbia, 2020). This situation is described in
statistics as a “convenience sampling”, in which case it is known that no probabilistic inference
is possible (Hansen et al, 1953). As Fisher (1935) says “If we aim at a satisfactory
generalization of the sample results, the sample experiment needs to be rigorously
programmed”.
Indeed, while in a formal sample design the choice of sample observations is guided by a
precise mechanism which allows the calculation of the probabilities of inclusion of each unit
(and, hence, probabilistic inference), on the contrary with a convenience collection no
probability of inclusion can be calculated thus giving rise to over- under-representativeness of
the sample units. The advantages of using a convenience sampling are the obvious ease of data
collection and cost-effectiveness. However, the disadvantages are that the results cannot be
generalized to a larger population because the under- (or over-) representation of units produce
a bias. Furthermore, convenience sampling-based estimates are characterized by larger
standard error and as a consequence by insufficient power in hypothesis testing.
In this situation the estimation of parameters (like mean, median, proportions) based on the
principle of analogy and the calculation of p-values to take decisions in hypothesis testing is
not theoretically motivated. SCV, indeed, acknowledge the fact that the collection criterion
used could have generated possible biases in their sample. They list problems like the fact that
a substantial proportion are travelers (who are predominantly adults), that data are captured by
the health system and so are biased toward more severe cases, that geographical coverage is
heterogeneous with an under-representation of provinces with a weaker health infrastructure.
However, they do not take any action to reduce such biases.
The problem raised by the convenience collection of data emerges dramatically in the Big Data
era when we increasingly avail data which, almost invariably, do not satisfy the necessary
conditions for probabilistic inference. In recent years researchers are becoming aware of this
problem trying to suggest solutions to reduce the distorting effects inherent to non-probabilistic
designs (Fricker and Schonlau, 2002). One possible strategy consists in transforming
crowdsourced datasets in such a way that they resemble a formal sample design. This procedure
has been termed post-sampling (Arbia et al., 2018) and represents a particular form of poststratification (Holt and Smith, 1979; Little, 1993).
To implement a post-sampling analysis, we need to calculate, in each geographical location
(e.g. the Chinese provinces), a post-sampling ratio (PS), defined as the ratio between the
number of observations required by a reference formal sample design (e.g. random stratified
with probability of inclusion proportional to size) and those collected through crowdsourcing.
More reliable estimations of population parameters can then be obtained by considering a
weighted version of the dataset using the post-sampling ratio as weights. Thus, crowdsourced
observations will have to be over-weighted if 𝑃𝑆! > 1 and, on the contrary, down-weighted
when 𝑃𝑆! < 1. This strategy has been adopted in Arbia et al. (2018) in order to estimate the
food price index in Nigeria using data crowdsourced through smartphones and in Arbia and
Nardelli (2020) to estimate spatial regression models. After post-sampling, estimates display
less bias and lower standard errors and the reduction in the power of the tests is moderated.
3. Problems related to spatial/network correlation

The dataset used by SCV refer to 507 individuals (364 from China and the rest from abroad).
Both in the estimation of the epidemiological parameters reported in Section 1 and in
hypothesis testing the authors treat their crowdsourced data as if they were independent.
Indeed, both the Wilcoxon and the Kruskal–Wallis test are based on the assumptions that all
the observations are independent of each other. However, even if data were collected obeying
a formal sample design, a further potential source of bias is the fact that the observational units
could display a certain degree of spatial/network correlation (Cliff and Ord, 1973; Arbia, 2006).
Observed units that are close in space or in network interaction, may display similar values in
the observed variables (e. g. age, incubation period, delays between symptoms and seeking
care at hospital) due to the interaction between individuals or/and to presence of some
unobserved latent variable with a geographical component. The effects of spatial correlation in
the geography of epidemics is well documented in the book by Cliff et al. (1981). When
observed data are not independent and display a positive spatial/network correlation, the
standard errors are underestimated leading to inefficient estimation of the various parameters
(mean, median, proportion etc.). But the consequence on hypothesis testing can be even worse.
Due to the underestimation of the standard errors, indeed, the statistical test become artificially
inflated leading to lower p-values and, as a consequence, to the rejection of the null hypotheses
more frequently than we should. As a result, the significance of the statistical test can become
very poor with very artificially high probability of type I error. This could explain the very low
levels of p-values (of the order of 10-4) reported in the SCV paper despite the relatively small
dataset used. Standard statistical textbooks like Shabenberger and Gotway (2004) and Cressie
and Wikle (2011) document how to calculate the level of spatial/network correlation between
geographically located individuals and how this parameter can be used in the process of
estimation and hypothesis testing in order to obtain more reliable inferential conclusions.
4. Concluding remarks
The work by Sun, Chen and Viboud (2020) has to be commended, given the absolute relevance
of the topic for health security and the timeliness with which results are presented in a period
of great uncertainty related to the worldwide diffusion of the new corona virus Covid-19. Their
results are of invaluable help in the process of surveillance, monitoring and control of the
disease. In this comment we draw the attention of the authors and of all the researchers and
health operators on the fact that the crowdsourced dataset they use can lead to biases in the
estimation of the epidemiological parameters and in hypothesis testing procedures.
We hope that this note may help future studies in the area, so as to obtain even more reliable
estimation and more grounded tests of theoretical hypotheses thus progressing rapidly and
rigorously in the knowledge about covid-19 and any possible future new epidemics.
