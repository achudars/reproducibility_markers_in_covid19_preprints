Abstract
Multiple small- to middle-scale cities, mostly located in northern China, became epidemic hotspots
during the second wave of the spread of COVID-19 in early 2021. Despite qualitative discussions of
potential social-economic causes, it remains unclear how this pattern could be accounted for from a
quantitative approach. Through the development of an urban epidemic hazard index (EpiRank), we
came up with a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon. The index is constructed from epidemic
simulations on a multi-layer transportation network model on top of local SEIR transmission dynamics,
which characterizes intra- and inter-city compartment population flow with a detailed mathematical
description. Essentially, we argue that these highlighted cities possess greater epidemic hazards due to
the combined effect of large regional population and small inter-city transportation. The proposed index,
dynamic and applicable to different epidemic settings, could be a useful indicator for the risk assessment
and response planning of urban epidemic hazards in China; the model framework is modularized and can
be adapted for other nations without much difficulty.

Despite the nation-wide successful implementation of control measures against COVID-19 (Kraemer et al.,
2020; Lai et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020), multiple small- to middle-scale cities in China became local epidemic
hotspots during the new wave of the pandemic in early 2021; the list includes Tonghua, Songyuan, Suihua,
Qiqihar, Heihe, and Xingtai etc. (Yew , 2021; Steven, 2021). Unlike their nearby capital cities (e.g., Shijiazhuang, Changchun, Harbin), these small cities are probably not known to many Chinese before they are
enlisted as “high-risk regions” after the local bursts, and it is indeed an unexpected phenomenon that they
are highlighted among the over 340 prefectural administrations in China. It is implied that the likelihood of
epidemic hazards is high in these regions. Many social-economic factors may account for this fact (Niu et
al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020): for example, social scientists may observe that these cities are all located in the
northeast part of China, where local economies are often underdeveloped, and local residents are often more
behavioral active than they are supposed to be in face of the epidemic (e.g., Shelach, 2006); other conjectures
may attend to the fact that since these are neither coastal cities nor metropolitans where imported cases
are more common, local control measures and regulations are different and somewhat relaxed, which led

to heedlessness of early signals (e.g., Ye et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021), or that these northern regions have
cold winters and also less residential housing space than the south, hence the hazard of severe infections
was harbored (e.g., Cao et al., 2020). Although these arguments are sound, it is desired that quantitative
explanations could be addressed to decipher why such small cities in China stand out as epidemic hotspots.
This points to the significant necessity of the quantification of urban regions’ epidemic hazards, desirably via
a constructed index that assesses the extent of potential risk. Such indices of potential epidemic risk can be
useful for effective decision analysis during epidemic response and planning (Morse et al., 2012; Hamele et
al., 2018), critical to the mitigation of sudden and potentially catastrophic impacts of infectious diseases on
society (Shearer et al., 2020). Indeed, although the exit of COVID-19 is still on the fly, both methodologically
and practically (Thompson et al., 2020), it is nevertheless prudent to start getting prepared for the next
pandemic (Liu et al., 2018; Neumann and Kawaoka, 2019; Simpson et al., 2020), both economically and
ecologically (Di Marco et al., 2020; Dobson et al., 2020), through comprehensive pandemic risk management
synthesis (Studzinski and Pasteur , 2020) and the upgraded implementation of digital technologies (Budd et
al., 2020)
Many successful attempts have been made to develop such epidemic risk indices from various angles. According to US CDC, the preparedness for influenza pandemics can be assessed with the Influenza Risk Assessment
Tool (Trock et al., 2012; Cox et al., 2014; Burke and Trock , 2018) through the Pandemic Severity Assessment
Framework (Reed et al., 2013; Holloway et al., 2014); for the same purpose, the Tool for Influenza Pandemic
Risk Assessment (WHO-TIPRA, 2016) is recommended by WHO; and there are miscellaneous other tools
developed for national-level pandemic planning, through either mathematical simulations (e.g., Eichner et
al., 2007) or scoring systems, in which case various social-economic factors are being considered (e.g., McKay
et al., 2019; Oppenheim et al., 2019; Grima et al., 2020).
However, it is suggested that currently a suitable public health evaluation framework for the assessment of
epidemic risk and response is still not full-fledge in scale (Warsame et al., 2020). Most proposed tools and
frameworks are subject to a few shortcomings: (1) assessments are in most cases from the supply side (i.e., the
preparedness) instead of the demand side (i.e., the actual risk); (2) assessment of pandemic potential is often
virus-specific (i.e., pathological), not sufficiently general-purpose, as the risk potential is also determined by
various societal factors (transportation, population (Copiello and Grillenzoni , 2020) etc.); (3) many indices
rely on expert scoring systems that often depend largely on subjectivity, and the calling for mathematical
models and algorithms for risk assessment and pandemic planning is compelling (Wu and Cowling, 2011);
(4) finally, many models focus on nation-wide evaluation, and there is relatively little concentration on subnation (e.g., city) level analysis, except for a few interesting attempts (e.g., Prieto et al., 2020; Boyce and
Katz , 2002; Zhu et al., 2020).
To deal with this problem, in this study we develop a novel epidemic hazard index for Chinese cities,
which quantifies the potential risk of epidemic spread at the over 340 Chinese prefectural administrations.
The index relies on a simulation model which integrates intra-city compartment dynamics and a detailed
mathematical description of inter-city multi-channel transportation. Calculation of the hazard index is based
on this dynamic system that simulates the domestic epidemic spread for user-specified diseases. In the model,
intra-city evolution is governed by the SEIR dynamics assuming no epidemic response taken place, such that
the constructed index serves as an early-warning indicator at early periods of epidemics, before the incidence
of any structural change in the population flow upon policy intervention (e.g., Schlosser et al., 2020; Li ,
2021); inter-city transportation is modeled with a multi-layer bipartite network (Li , 2020), which make
explicit considerations of various events during inter-city population flow, including transit, cross-infection
due to path overlap, as well as the different transmissivities on different transportation media.
Such a highlight on transportation (i.e., spacial patterns) is core to the city-specific risk assessment of
epidemics (Smith et al., 2002) and natural hazards in general (Greiving et al., 2006). Indeed, over the course
of the still on-going pandemic, it is acknowledged that transportation, at both the global and the domestic
level, plays a critical role during the spread of viruses and to a large extent may determine the severity of the
disease at different geological divisions (Christidis and Christodoulou, 2020; Liu et al., 2021). Essentially,
compared to regression models (Bo et al., 2014) or the machine-learning approach (Feng et al., 2021), the
highlight of transportation asks for epidemic risk analysis from a network perspective (e.g., Chu et al., 2020;

2

Ge et al., 2020; So et al., 2020), upon which the risk scores could then be computed from quantitative
approaches (So et al., 2020). An important precedent is the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) model,
which integrates sociodemographic and population mobility data in a spatially structured stochastic disease
approach to simulate the spread of epidemics at the worldwide scale (Balcan et al., 2010). GLEaM considers
the commuting on the airport network on top of local disease transmission, where transportation is modeled
via an effective operator; our model adopts a similar methodology yet constructs a more realistic multi-layer
mathematical description of inter-city transportation, comparing also to various recent studies in the same
line of research (Jia et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2021).

Model
The model is developed in Li (2020) and is briefed summarized here. Assume a bi-partite graph with cities
(nodes) classified as either central cities or peripheral cities. The network is multi-layer G = (V, EA/B/R/S ),
specifying four means of inter-city transportation (i.e., different layers have different connectivites between
nodes): Air (A), Bus (B), Rail (R) and Sail (S). At each node, the local urban population is divided into
four compartments: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), Recovered (R), and the intra-city epidemic
spread follows the standard SEIR dynamics (e.g., Sterman, 2000; Newman, 2010). We track the in- and
out-flow of the exposed, susceptible and recovered population at each node on the transportation network,
which determines the open-system SEIR dynamics (for a specific city i):

}
between pairs of cities (i, j) specified for each means of transportation q. During the inter-city flow, transit
events are considered, where only a certain proportion of flow (T Rc/p for central/peripheral cities, the same
for each layer) enter the local population, and the rest are directed to other destinations. Moreover, crossinfections during inter-city travels are modeled, which take place between a susceptible person and an exposed
person who share an overlapped travel path with the same destination. The strength of the cross-infection
spillover effect RTq various on different transportation media (e.g., Hu et al., 2020).

EpiRank
With the constructed model framework, essentially a simulator of the spread of epidemics, we are able
to simulate imaginary diseases of arbitrary epidemiological features originated from arbitrary epicenters.
Suppose an epidemic initiated at node i, with a certain set of epidemiological parameters R0 , DE , DI . It
is important to quantify the intensity of this epidemic, i.e., the extent of its spread on the domestic scale.
This points to a centrality measure of the node that characterizes nodes’ ability in spreading an epidemic.
Borrowing from the idea of PageRank (Page et al., 1999; Langville and Meyer , 2011), we construct this new
centrality score in a way similar to the eigenvalue centrality and term it as the EpiRank.
Start the simulator with the disease seeded at node i upon a given zoonotic force, specified with z(t) during
period tsz to tez . Consider a constant force z0 over such a period (whose length is ∆tz ), and the overall
zoonotic force Z is:

Z=
z(t)dt ∼

The simulation proceeds, during which the local disease spreads to the entire nation via the transportation
τ
network. After τ time steps, we obtain the number of infected cases at city j, denoted as Iij
, with the first

subscript indicating the epicenter. Similarly we obtain Rij , Eij etc. We define the normalized total infection

at city j as Uij

τ

applying a cutoff f (Uij ) = max(Uij − U0 , 0).

This score hi thus indicates the spreading intensity of epidemics at any node i, which is contributed by
(1) the city’s local severity of the epidemic, and (2) its ability of spreading the disease to other cities, with
the intensity scores of other cities contributing to its own score at particular weights. α ∈ [0, 1] is the
modulating parameter weighing over these two effects: a small α concerns more on the city-wide local spread
of the epidemic (α = 0 corresponds to a complete local index), while a large α puts more weight on the city’s
capability of spreading the disease out.

Results
Connectivities of each layer (i.e., transportation routes) are determined from public datasets and empirical
considerations; city information (population, GDP etc.) is obtained from public datasets; transportation
parameters (flowmap, transfer rate, cross-infection strength) are determined through fitting the early spread
of COVID-19 in China in January-February 2020, where the multi-parameter inversion is conducted via a
smart gradient method (see (Li , 2020) and Supplemental Materials). Transfer rate at central/peripheral
cities are T Rc = 0.4 and T Rp = 0.05; the cross-infection strength are {RTA , RTR , RTS , RTB } = {1.2, 1.5, 1.5, 3}
on the four transportation media; inter-city flows are different for different types of city pairs (centralA
R
central, central-peripheral, peripheral-peripheral), and are determined at fcc/cp/pp
= 1000/500/0, fˆcc/cp/pp
=
S
B
2000/200/500, fcc/cp/pp = 100/100/100, fcc/cp/pp = 0/3000/1000. These transportation parameters well fit
the early spread of COVID-19 in China; they are independent of epidemiological concerns and are fixed
throughout the simulations.
For epidemiological parameters, the zoonotic force z is assumed to be 5 persons/day at Day 1 and zero
afterwards, at a single epicenter (the simulator nevertheless allows for simultaneous bursts at multiple epicenters). The base-case disease is fixed at R0 = 2.5, DE = 6 days and DI = 3 days, i.e., a mild reproduction
of virus and a medium-range infection duration, close to the clinical parameters of COVID or SARS (e.g.,
Wu et al., 2020). Unintervened spread of this seeded disease to all Chinese prefectural districts is simulated
for 30 days, after which the ever-infected population (Ii + Ri ) in each city i are recorded and are used to
compute the hazard index h.

Figure 2: Urban Epidemic Hazard Index (EpiRank) of Chinese Cities (with population greater than 1
million). Assuming a simulated disease with R0 = 2.5, DE = 6 days, DI = 3 days, seeded by a 1-day
zoonotic force at the strength of 5 persons/day; α = 0.25. Table: Top 15 ranks. Among 300 cities, the six
ground-true cities are successfully indicated at high rankings (four in top 5% and all six in top 10%).
Cities having population larger than 1 million (300 out of 347) participate in the calculation of h under
equation (9). For a value of α = 0.25, the determined rankings of cities’ epidemic hazards are shown in
Figure 2 (top 40 in the graph and top 15 in the table). One sees that, quite strikingly, the six small cities
6

where the new bursts of COVID took place (Tonghua, Songyuan, Suihua, Qiqihar, Heihe, Xingtai) are
successfully highlighted by the computed hazard index. All six cities rank within or near top 10% in the
list, including four cities ranking within the top 15. Tests suggest that the result is robust; the high ranks
of the six denoted ground-true cities are largely invariant to fluctuations in both transportation parameters
and epidemiological parameters.
The hazard rankings are computed at different α, and correlation of the ranks is demonstrated via the
Spearman’s correlation coefficient (Figure 3; comparing top 30 entries of each rank). A stable ranking at
small values of α is identified, along with a second invariance at the larger end (Figure 3 center). Indeed, the
ranking is almost completely different at, for example, α = 0.1 vs. α = 0.8, with the latter having a new set
of cities ranked top in the list which are mostly located in the middle of China. This is consistent with our
theory, as a small/large α points to either of the two end-members of epidemic hazards: the city-wide local
spread, or the capability of spreading the disease to other locations. Therefore, cities ranking high at small
α are regions with mass population but relatively small transportation means, in which case local epidemic
bursts are severely harbored (Iacus et al., 2020) but not much spillovered to other cities. On the opposite,
cities ranking high at large α are regions where inter-city transportation is sufficiently viable with respect
to the humble local population; in this case, when seeded a virus, the city is less likely to become a closed
epidemic cluster than to enormously spread the disease out to other regions. The epidemic hazard index
thus also implies the condition of a city’s inter-city transportation infrastructures.

We initiated simulations for different sets of epidemiological parameters of the assumed disease (Figure 3),
with the combination of low/medium/high infectivity (R0 = 1.5/2.5/4) and short/medium/long infection
7

duration ((DE , DI ) = (2, 2)/(6, 3)/(9, 10) days). The invariance at small α is largely maintained across the
experiments, expect for a very severe virus with high infectivity and short duration (R0 = 4.0, (DE , DI ) =
(2, 2)). In this case, 30 days is sufficient for most population in most cities to get infected, and thus top
rankings lean instead on densely populated cities. The second invariance around high α is also identifiable,
although not as clear as the first one. In some cases there is a third cluster at intermediate values of α, but
its significance is not as high as the first two which have well-grounded interpretations. Overall, one is able
to conclude that the two end-options of the epidemic hazard index, using small or large α, hold meaningful
across different scenarios of epidemic onset.

compared to EpiRank (results in Figure 2); differences marked with green, red or black arrows and numbers.
The ratio is effective but less accurate than EpiRank in highlighting the six epicenters (with star marks).
Shear population or city GDP does not provide the same indication.

Discussion
From the model and results one deduces that, the high epidemic hazard of these small-scale cities computed
at low α, in which case hi draws heavily on a city’s own infection Uii , derives from the combined effect
of two factors: a relatively large local population, and a small inter-city transportation flow. Intuitively, a
serious epidemic cluster at the regional scale is going to develop, when the region is sufficiently populated,
and not much inter-city outflow is dispersing the infection out of the epicenter. This inspires the idea that
alternatively, we could compute the population/outflow ratio of each city and use this quantity to indicate
cities’ epidemic hazard. Results show that (Figure 4) similar to EpiRank, this ratio does serve as a good
hazard indicator, under which the six denoted cities are listed with high ranks; furthermore, by contrast,
shear population or city GDP, arguably two most considered social-economic indicators of urban regions
(Niu et al., 2020), are not valid to reflect the ground-true ranking. Conceptually, analysis on EpiRank
help us pin down these two quantities among various social-economic factors in establishing a promising
mathematical explanation of the observed phenomenon. For robust tests, we proportionally increased and
decreased values on the flowmaps; results suggest that the effectiveness of this ratio (and certainly the

8

effectiveness of EpiRank) in highlighting the six epicenters is largely invariant to changes in absolute flow
strength.
Nevertheless, it is seen that the simple population/outflow ratio, although still effective and easy to compute,
is not as accurate and informative as EpiRank. This time the six ground-true cities are overall lower
ranked, with only 2 out 6 in top 5%. This is because this ratio only considers a city’s own population and
transportation condition, whereas EpiRank takes a full account of the regional and then the entire national
picture, under the networked dynamics approach. Indeed, it is not empirically inconsistent to argue that
the six high-epidemic-risk cities are all located in the north, not only because they themselves have large
population and small inter-city outflow, but also because it is exactly that cities in northern China, with
which the six cities exchange most outflow population, all tend to have such features and therefore the effect
of local clusters is further locked in. The advantage of EpiRank is implied; certainly, the simple ratio is also
not able to reveal cities’ ability of spreading the disease out, as EpiRank can shed light on with high α.
Although a promising quantitative explanation for the researched phenomenon is developed, it is yet indiscreet to conclude that EpiRank is by any means a sufficiently accurate index of urban epidemic hazards.
The current dynamic network model draws little besides the two aspects, urban population and inter-city
transportation, and too many real-world factors are left out. Validation of EpiRank results is also difficult
to be conducted in a systematic and rigorous way, besides using the six epicenters as the ground truth.
Despite a mathematically consistent and empirically effective approach, the proposed simulation framework
and the constructed EpiRank index needs further analysis and extensive tests in various settings (e.g., to
investigate the situation in the US (e.g., Chang et al., 2021)), before their powers and shortcomings could
be substantially uncovered; this study only serves as a first attempt.
