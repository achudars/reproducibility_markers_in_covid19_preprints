Using a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) meta-population model of disease transmission, we
present analytical calculations and numerical simulations dissecting the interplay between stochasticity and
the division of a population into mutually independent sub-populations. We show that subdivision activates
two stochastic effects—extinction and desynchronization—diminishing the overall impact of the outbreak,
even when the total population has already left the stochastic regime and the basic reproduction number is
not altered by the subdivision. Both effects are quantitatively captured by our theoretical estimates, allowing
us to determine their individual contributions to the observed reduction of the peak of the epidemic.
Simple models for the spread of infectious diseases are useful for the quantitative characterization of an epidemic as well as for forecasting
future infection numbers and guiding decisionmaking for containment. Different extensions and
refined versions of these models have been created to extract various factors that may be critical for the dynamics and the prevention of epidemics. Although it is well-known that stochastic fluctuations can alter the dynamics as well,
they are often neglected at higher infection number levels, such that the contact rates and basic
reproduction number become the central quantities of interest. In contrast, we investigate a
situation in which stochastic effects can quantitatively change the course of an epidemic when
infection numbers are large and contact rates remain unaltered. We consider an extended SIR
model in which a large population is subdivided
into a certain number of sub-populations, each
containing only a few infected individuals. For
the limiting case of perfect isolation, i.e. when
the epidemic evolves independently in each subpopulation with no cross-infections, we derive analytical estimates for these stochastic effects that
together recapitulate the results of extensive numerical simulations. Our central quantity of interest is the peak total number of simultaneously
infected individuals, which we compare between
the subdivided population and a single large population with identical reproduction number. Our
analysis suggests that regional isolation can resurrect certain stochastic effects and thereby contribute to effective containment, regardless of the
initial distribution of infected individuals.

INTRODUCTION

Generic models such as the Susceptible-InfectedRemoved (SIR) model conceived by Kermack and
McKendrik1 are indispensable for characterizing the bulk
properties of epidemics and determining the influence of
crucial parameters on the dynamics. The contact rate
between individuals, which is proportional to the reproduction number R0 , usually plays a crucial role, as its
reduction through containment measures directly slows
the spreading of the disease. On a large scale (states
or countries), numbers of infections during the height
of an epidemic are usually large, such that deterministic mean-field descriptions are appropriate. These have
been widely used to track the course of epidemics and
the effect of interventions, for example for the current
spreading of COVID-192 .
While many details about the biology and modes of
infection of a specific disease are important for its dynamics in detailed models3 , even basic SIR models have
been extended in various conceptual directions. Besides
various general topologies of the underlying contact and
mobility networks4–6 , so-called meta-population models
have been used to separate the disease dynamics within
local environments from its spread between them7 . It
has been shown that it is possible to calculate effective
quantities for the whole population, such as reproduction
numbers (i.e. a threshold theorem)8 , the final attack ratio9 and criteria for persistence10 in deterministic models
of such subdivided populations.
Another important important deviation from simple
bulk behavior arises through stochasticity (see Ref. 11
and references therein). Stochastic versions of extended
SIR and related models have been used to calculate
corrections to the outbreak threshold12 , consequences
of stochasticity for contact tracing13 and other control
schemes14 , to only name a few. Stochastic effects are also
observed in agent-based15 and meta-population models16,17 . Here we seek to study the joint effect of subdivision and stochasticity on the overall magnitude of an

epidemic for a fixed initial number of infected individuals
in the total population. In general, subdivision can be
expected to artificially boost fluctuations, as the infection numbers in each sub-population can be small even
when the total number of infections in the entire population is large. We would like to quantify the ability of such
increased stochasticity to reduce the impact of the epidemic. We deliberately refrain from applying any form of
traditional containment in our model, such as further reductions in contact rate or contact tracing18 . In particular, we design the subdivision such that the deterministic
dynamics of the epidemic in the subdivided population
remains unchanged compared to a single large population, as outlined in section II. This allows us to compare
the peak number of infected individuals in the entire population for each scenario both analytically and numerically in order to extract the specific effects of stochasticity triggered by subdivision.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL

A.

Reaction system

We consider a population of N individuals with SIR
dynamics1
b/N

S + I −−−−→ I + I,

k

I −−→ R,

(1)

with S, I and R referring to susceptible, infected and removed individuals, respectively, where removal with percapita rate k happens due to recovery, quarantine or

death. The rate b corresponds to the number of contacts per unit time an individual has with a random other
individual in the population, multiplied by the probability that a contact between a susceptible and an infected individual leads to transmission. The total transition rate from S to I per unit time is therefore Nb S I.
The two rates b and k are related to the basic reproduction number R0 = b/k, which is independent of population size. The deterministic epidemic threshold above
which an outbreak occurs is R0 = 1, and we assume
R0 > 1 throughout this study. The population is subject
to the total constraint N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t), where
we denote the number of individuals in each state by the
same letters. For simplicity, all initial conditions assume
R(0) = 0, such that they are uniquely defined by N and
the number of initially infected I0 = I(0).
When a population of total size N is split up into Ns
sub-populations, we simulate Ns separate copies of the
system (1), with N , S, I and R replaced by Ni , Si , Ii
and Ri respectively, where the index i refers to the
P differentPsub-populations
and

Ii and R =
Ri refer to the population totals. The initial number of infected individuals
are distributed either uniformly or randomly across the
Ns sub-populations. All numerical results in this study
are obtained from stochastic simulations of Eq. (1) using the Gillespie algorithm19 . To account for the inherent stochasticity of the system, several realizations, i.e.
identical simulations with different random number generator seeds, are simulated for each parameter set. We
report the number of realizations as well as distributions,
averages and standard deviations across the results as appropriate. Our main figure of interest is the peak number
of infected individuals Imax or equivalently the peak infected fraction of the population γ = Imax /N . These
could be considered a measure for the impact of the epidemic and the strain on the health care system and public
health resources such as the agencies that perform contact tracing and testing.

which give rise to two regimes in the dynamics. During

peak value

where the approximation for the maximum fraction of infected individuals 0 < γ < 1 is valid as long as the entire
population is initially susceptible, i.e. S(0) ≈ N 20 . In
the secondary regime when the recovery dynamics dominates, I decays to zero exponentially, as the number of
susceptibles decreases below the value necessary to sustain spreading.
In this deterministic system, a subdivision into Ns
smaller sub-populations of size N/Ns will have no effect,
since Eq. (2) remains invariant when S, I, R and N are
scaled by the common factor 1/Ns . Relative to their
individual sub-population sizes Ni , the same dynamics
are therefore observed in all sub-populations
P and thePdynamics of P
the population totals S =
Si , I =
Ii
and R =
Ri are identical to those of a single large
population. The subdivision is therefore not analogous
to cutting links in a contact network but rather a redistribution of them, since we assume that the contact
rate b remains unchanged. This conservative assumption
means that individuals in each sub-population still have
the same number of contacts per unit time as they had
in the large population, despite the smaller number of
individuals to choose from. While, in reality, the contact
rate b might decrease in such a situation and deterministically reduce R0 and therefore Imax , we intentionally
keep it constant here to extract the effects of stochasticity.

tuations in timing happen early on, their effect is only
seen later during the saturation phase.
During the initial phase, we can assume that S ≈ N
and that I follows a simple birth-death process with rates
b for “birth” and k for “death”. We shall use this analogy
for derivations throughout this study and in the appendices. We briefly recapitulate one important result from
the theory of branching processes here, namely that an
exponentially growing population that starts from an initial condition of I(0) = 1 has a finite extinction probability of
P0 (t) =

k e(b−k)t − 1
·
b e(b−k)t − k/b

.

(4)

which asymptotically approaches k/b at long times; see
the derivation in Appendix A. This means that with
probability pext
= k/b the dynamics never enters the
1
exponentially growing deterministic regime, but decays
back to zero due to number fluctuations22 . For two independent lineages in the same population, the extinc2
tion probability is therefore pext
2 = (k/b) , and, similarly,
ext
n
pn = (k/b) , as long as the total population is sufficiently large such that the lineages do not interfere with
each other. We will use these extinction probabilities and
other statistics of the birth-death process to derive analytical approximations for the effects of extinction and
desynchronization on the stochastic dynamics.

Stochastic behavior

Deterministic behavior only applies if S and I are both
large, particularly only after the number of infected people I has risen to appreciable levels. If I is still low,
stochastic fluctuations determine whether I will “take
off” and develop exponential behavior, even if b > k.
This effect was already considered shortly after Kermack
and McKendrick introduced the original SIR model21 and
is now well-known. However, in a subdivided population,
it can significantly alter the course of the outbreak in the
total population if the initial number of infected individuals in a single sub-population is low enough (even
if the number is large in the total population). An example for populations of N = 1,000,000 individuals split
into Ns = 10 sub-populations is shown in Figs. 1a and
1b, along with the expected dynamics of a single large
population (red curve). In one example set of 10 subpopulations, only three sub-populations (blue, yellow,
and green curves) experience a significant outbreak, and
they are desynchronized with a broad distribution of individual peak times (1c). Spontaneous extinction and
desynchronization lead to an average behavior across 100
simulations with a significantly reduced peak (turquoise
curve). Note that, on average, both the undivided large
population and the sum of the smaller sub-populations
initially exhibit comparable exponential growth in the
number of infected individuals (Fig. 1b). This means
that, while extinction in some sub-populations and fluc-

Extinction

To obtain an estimate for the effect of extinction
and the distribution of infected individuals, we add up
the maximum numbers of infected individuals in the
sub-populations. Each of these peaks is approximately
γN/Ns , but only if the infection does not stochastically
become extinct during the initial stages. For large population sizes and values of b/k that result in a significant
peak, extinction usually happens well before the peak
is reached in other sub-populations (see Appendix B),
such that these populations do not contribute. Therefore, on average, the contribution of each sub-population
will be Is,max (n) = γ (1 − pext
n ) N/Ns , where n indicates
the number of initial infected individuals in the subpopulation and pext
is the probability that they go exn
tinct without entering deterministic growth as discussed
above. Therefore, the total peak number of infected individuals in all the
P sub-populations due to extinction is
ext
given by Imax
= n gn Is,max (n), where gn is the number
of sub-populations
P with n initially infected individuals.
Note that Ns = n gn . Combining the above equations,

where g1 = I0 is the total number of initially infected individuals in the large population (for this to make sense,

where the population was not split up, the peak number
of infected can therefore be reduced by increasing the
number of sub-populations Ns or by bringing b closer to
k. Note that this is in addition to a potential decrease in
the deterministic peak fraction γ of infected (cf. Eq. (3))
that would result if the subidivision also led to fewer contacts (i.e. a reduced rate b), which we have conservatively
assumed not to be the case here.

2.

Desynchronization

The independent summation of maxima in different
sub-populations is a conservative estimate, since fluctuations can lead to stochastic desynchronization and thus
to a further reduction of the peak value. The distribution of peak times in the sub-populations from the previous example is shown in Fig. 1c. The temporal shift
between the different sub-populations can be attributed
entirely to stochastic fluctuations in the initial phase of
the dynamics. Assuming that this time shift accumulates
while the dynamics can still be modeled as a pure birthdeath process without saturation effects, we can derive
the probability distribution for the deviation from the
mean peak time ∆tpeak ≡ tpeak − htpeak i as
P (∆tpeak ) = k(1 − k/b)[1 − (k/b)n ]

where n is the initial number of infected individuals in the

the exponential of the Euler constant (see Appendix C
for details). Note that n here was only used to incorporate the extinction probability, while the shape of the
distribution is based on a single initially infected individual. Nevertheless this result is in excellent agreement
with the measured distribution for randomly distributed
infected individuals (see dashed line in Fig. 1c).

Numerical results

We consider as an example a region with a population of 8,000,000 and 500 infected individuals (I0 /N ∼
6 · 10−5 ), and assume a removal rate of k = 0.14, corresponding to a realistic mean removal time of 1/k ≈ 7 days
for the recent epidemic23 (particularly if symptomatic individuals are quickly removed from the infectious pool
through quarantining). Let us further assume that the
infectious contact rate is b = 0.2 (> k). This corresponds
to a substantial reduction of R0 from its initial value of
2–2.524 through mild measures such as social distancing,
although the epidemic would still spread exponentially,
with infection numbers doubling about every 12 days.
If this population is allowed to mix homogeneously, the
dynamics will evolve according the deterministic prediction with a peak around 5% infected individuals (blue
data in Figs. 2). If instead, the population is split up and
the 500 infected people are distributed randomly across
the sub-populations, the peak percentage of infected individuals decreases to around 3% (for 100 sub-populations
of 80,000 people) or 1% (for 500 sub-populations of
16,000 people) on average (red and yellow, respectively).
In all cases, the analytical estimate which only considers the extinction effect, Eq. (6), is only an upper bound
for the peak percentage of infected individuals in the total population, while also considering desynchronization
according to Eq. (9) yields a good estimate the typical
peak values. The peak time distributions for the three
different ways of splitting up the population shown in
Fig. 2c also agree with the analytical estimate of Eq. (8).
Note that these distributions are not normalized since
a significant fraction of sub-populations experience extinction of the epidemic and therefore do not exhibit a
peak. There is also a subtle, non-monotonic effect on the

termination time of the epidemic (Fig. 2d), whose distribution is broader when the population is split up, but
does not change position appreciably. Note that the reduction for Ns = 500 sub-populations in Fig. 2 is comparable (or even slightly lower) than the case where the 500
infected individuals are not distributed randomly across
the sub-populations, but each sub-population contains
exactly one infected individual. In this case (see Fig. 3),
there are no sub-populations with initially zero infected
individuals, implying that the reduction in peak value
compared to the large homogeneous population is strictly
due to extinction and desynchronization, which are again
well predicted by the analytical estimates.
To examine the validity of our approximations across

6
different parameters, we varied the contact rate b and
carried out numerical simulations for values of R0 ranging between 1.14 and 2. We analyzed the resulting peak
magnitudes to extract the individual contributions of extinction and desynchronization, which are in excellent
agreement with our predictions of Eq. (6) and (9), as
shown in Fig. 4. The contribution of extinction alone
was estimated numerically by summing maxima in different sub-populations, regardless of their timing. Overall, the simulations confirm the relative importance of
the extinction effect, whereas the additional reduction
by desynchronization plays a smaller role. Figs. 4a and b
show the case where Ns = I0 = 100, i.e. number of subpopulations and initially infected individuals is the same,
and exactly one infected individual is placed in each subpopulation. This serves to demonstrate the maximum
effect of extinction, whereas in Fig. 4c, a large share of
the peak reduction is due to sub-populations containing
no infections, as I0 = 100 < Ns = 500. However, random
distribution of infected individuals for Ns = I0 = 500
(Fig. 4d) leads to a very similar result as in Fig. 4b,
although some of the reduction is due to the initial distribution (i.e. sub-population without any infections).
For a high number of sub-populations Ns as in Figs 4c
and d (and consequently smaller sub-population size),
deviations from the theory begin to appear towards low
values of b very close to k, as the time scale of the extinction process becomes comparable to that of the deterministic SIR dynamics. In this regime, the distinction
between an initial stochastic phase approximated by a
birth-death process and the onset of saturation effects
becomes increasingly blurred, as we show analytically in
Appendix B. In particular, this affects the estimation of
the extinction contribution (marked by black dots).

IV.

DISCUSSION

Reducing the infectious contact rate b or increasing the
removal rate k directly leads to a decrease of the deterministic peak fraction of infected, γ. The above analysis
shows that, even without changing R0 = b/k, the isolation of small sub-populations can reduce the overall peak
number of infected people in the ideal case of at most one
infected individual per sub-population by an additional
factor of up to I0 /Ns · (1 − k/b)/α when I0 /Ns < 1. One
contribution comes from the communities which have no
infections and are now protected (I0 /Ns ), while another
contribution comes from the possibility that an infection
chain in the local community stochastically ends due to
fluctuations (k/b). Stochastic desynchronization (1/α)
further reduces the peak by up to about 25% according
to Eq. (9). However, as shown by our estimates and confirmed by the numerical simulations, even outside this
ideal scenario, a reduction can be achieved, regardless of
the distribution of infected individuals across the subpopulations, and the reduction will be larger if b/k is
already close to 1. It is also worth noting that, in con-

trast to reductions in R0 = b/k, the time scale of the
outbreak is not increased.
The benefits of subdivision are obvious even from a
deterministic standpoint in the case where many regions
initially contain no infected individuals — in this case,
subdivision prevents spreading of the epidemic to diseasefree communities. However, our analysis shows that this
advantage persists due to stochastic extinction events
and desynchronization even if the sub-populations are so
large that many or all of them initially contain infections,
as long as I0 /Ns ∼ 1. Of course, increasing Ns further is
always beneficial due to the above-mentioned deterministic effect, with the trivial limiting case of one group per
household (an extremely strict lockdown). In contrast,
aiming at I0 /Ns ∼ 1 could still allow for a functioning
local socioeconomic life in fairly large sub-populations, if
I0 is not too large when the subdivision happens.
While extinction has been widely considered for SIRtype models11,21 and has been related to a minimum
number of infections necessary to cause a “major” outbreak14 , we have shown here that, even if the dynamics
in the large population is outside the stochastic regime,
it is possible to resurrect these effects by artificially subdividing the population. Because of the strong exponential dependence of the extinction probability on n
(see Eq. (5)) it is important to note that I0 denotes the
true number of infections, including undetected and/or
asymptomatic cases. Another aspect we have neglected
here is that of cross-infections: In reality, sub-populations
cannot be perfectly isolated, and so local extinction
might only be temporary, as has been seen in studies
of persistence10,16 . The calculated peak reduction would
be observed in the limit of small cross-infection rates. In
contrast to extinction, desynchronization does not reveal
itself on the level of a single population (except as a difference in timing) and is therefore an emergent property
of the subdivision scenario, which is likely to persist in
the presence of cross-infections. In the framework presented in section II A, these could be included (without
changing R0 ) by allowing a certain fraction ξ of contacts
across the entire population, and only restricting the remaining fraction 1−ξ to within each sub-population. We
set up such a model in a separate study25 to investigate
a potential realistic containment strategy.
In reality, individuals will not compensate for all
avoided contacts outside the local sub-population with
contacts within it, as we have a conservatively assumed
by keeping b constant upon subdivision. Instead, isolation will naturally lead to a reduction in b, akin to cutting
links in the spreading network5 , so that the effect of subdivision will be a combination of deterministic reductions
in R0 and the stochastic effects presented here. Subdivision of a population can be complementary to containment measures, such as social distancing and electronic
contact tracing13,23 , which still allow for a functioning
local public life. However, it also does not preclude the
activation of more drastic measures in regions beginning
to show deterministic exponential behavior25 .

Appendix A: Exact solution of the birth-death process

Consider a population of the infected individuals I that
can undergo the following two processes:
b

I →
− I + I,

k

I −
→ ∅,

(A1)

i.e., each I can give birth to another I with rate b, or, it
can die with rate k, at any time. Ignoring the stochasticity, the average behavior of the system is described by
exponential birth and death. The population n̄(t) can be
determined as follows:
dn̄(t)
= (b − k)n̄(t) ⇒ n̄(t) = e(b−k)t ,
dt

(A2)

where we have assumed that the initial size of the population is one. As this is a one-step process, the probability
of finding n copies of I in the sample at time t satisfies

8
which is a very interesting result. When k > b, n̄ → 0 at
long times, and we obtain P0 = 1. It is no surprise that

accuracy of maxima detection in sub-populations

Here, we derive quantitative estimates that allow us to
compare the time scale of the extinction process to that
of the deterministic peak in the SIR model. This is conceptually interesting in its own right, but it also allows
us to meaningfully differentiate between “real” maxima
and random transient peaks in the number of infected individuals in sub-populations that experience extinction.
In the pure birth-death process, the fraction of extinction events, 0 ≤ φx ≤ 1, that have already happened by
time t can easily be calculated from Eq. (A11) as
φx (t) =

This equation can be inverted to yield the time tx by
which a fraction φx of extinction events have happened:

On the other hand, we can also estimate the fraction of

(B3)

Evaluating φc (tx (φx ), nc ) therefore yields the fraction of
populations still below nc when a fraction φx of extinction
events have already happened. This expression can be
inverted to yield the simple relationship
nc (φx , φc ) = 1 +

log(1 − φc )
,
log φx

(B4)

giving the number of infected individuals below which
a fraction φc of non-extinct populations will still be, at
the time when a fraction φx of populations destined for
extinction have already reached the extinct state.
In order to estimate the effect of extinction in our numerical simulations (cf. Fig. 4), we detect the maximum

9
number of infected individuals in each sub-population
(independent of their timing), and compare the sum of
ext
these numbers to our estimate Imax
from the main text.
In the sub-populations that experience random extinction of the epidemic, the detected numerical maxima will
in reality be transient fluctuations before extinctions.
These contribute more and more as R0 = b/k → 1,
when the deterministic
peak value N γ = N 1 − (1 +

log R0 )/R0 20 decreases and the extinction probability
1/R0 increases. Using the estimates above, we can exclude these false maxima based on their timing, by only
considering those maxima for which

tmax > tx (φx ),

(B5)

and simultaneously ensuring that

nc (φx , φc ) < N γ,

(B6)

Appendix C: Analytical approximation of the relative peak
time distribution

The fact that the early phase of the dynamics in the
SIR model (when S ≈ N and I is small) corresponds
to a simple birth-death process also allows us to obtain
an analytical estimate for the peak time distributions of
the sub-populations. This can be readily adapted from a
similar calculation performed on an equivalent problem
in evolution, where the dynamics of a small mutant subpopulation with a given selective advantage can likewise
be understood as a birth-death branching process26 , for
which the transition from the initial stochastic regime
where extinction is still possible to the deterministic
regime of exponential growth corresponds to the establishment of the mutation in the population (which precedes fixation).
We obtain an approximation for the establishment
time distribution of the disease in a sub-population as


k −(b−k)τ
= k (1 − k/b) exp −(b − k)τ − e
,
b
(C1)
where we have corrected for an additional minus sign
missing from Ref.26 . The variation in the timing of the
later deterministic dynamics is due entirely to fluctuations in this initial stochastic phase. To compare this analytical approximation with our simulation results for the
peak time in the main text, we plot the non-normalized,
unconditional distribution
est

(τ )

is fulfilled. φx and φc play the role of accuracy parameters. The first condition ensures that false maxima are
excluded with probability φx , while the second one ensures that a pure birth-death process would not have
reached the deterministic SIR peak by the same time with
probability φc . Note that the latter is a conservative estimate, as growth in the SIR model is significantly slowed
before reaching its peak compared to a pure birth-death
process. In Fig. 4, we use a value of φx = φc = 0.99 to
exclude 99% of false maxima and still detect more than
99% of deterministic SIR maxima, except for the data
points marked as unreliable, for which Eq. (B6) is not
fulfilled and therefore the extinction process and the deterministic SIR peak are not clearly separated in time.
Conversely, this also means that for all other parameters
(i.e. larger R0 = b/k), extinction usually happens well
before the deterministic SIR dynamics reaches its peak.
It is worth emphasizing that, in the limit b → k
and small populations, the distinction between an initial
stochastic phase and a deterministic time course becomes
meaningless, since γ eventually becomes order ∼ 1/N
and the mean extinction time diverges. At this point,
the dynamics throughout will be dominated by random
growth of the number of infected individuals and stochastic fluctuations will continue to contribute, even as the
number of susceptibles decreases, eventually ending the
epidemic (i.e. during and beyond the maximum). In addition, the assumption that there is no depletion of susceptibles in the early phase (and thus the equivalence to a
pure birth-death process) breaks down. However, in this
study, we are interested in the regime where even subpopulations are still large, and while b is sufficiently close
to k to yield a significant extinction probability k/b, it
is large enough to lead to a significant deterministic outbreak peak. Therefore, we do not investigate this regime.

We note that simply shifting the mean of the distribution is justified because the dynamics is predominantly
identical in different sub-populations once they are
in the deterministic regime, while only lagging by a
random time span τ . This simple argument depends
on the assumption that stochastic fluctuations can be
ignored before deviations from exponential behavior
(i.e. saturation effects) have to be considered for the
deterministic dynamics. This is true for the scenarios we
consider in the SIR model, since our sub-populations still
consist of thousands of individuals and we are explicitly focusing on cases where b is not arbitrarily close to k.

Appendix D: Estimating the effect of sub-population
desynchronization

For estimating the peak reduction effect due to desynchronization of the sub-populations, it is convenient to
work with the normalized equations for s = S/N and
i = I/N , which read
ṡ = −bsi,

(D1a)

i̇ = bsi − ki.

(D1b)

When i reaches its peak γ = i(tpeak ), new infections and
recovery balance according to Eq. (D1b) and s(tpeak ) =
k/b. Based on this known value, we use the following
ansatz for s
s(t) =


k
1 + ε(t) ,
b

(D2)

with ε(tpeak ) = 0. Since we are interested in the regime
where there is a substantial extinction probability k/b,
s(tpeak ) is also still of order 1. Together with the fact
that i̇(tpeak ) = 0 by definition, we expect from Eq. (D1a)
that the lowest (linear) order of ε will suffice to describe
the dynamics around the peak, i.e. ε(t) ≈ ε1 · (t − tpeak )
(conversely, we expect this approximation to break down
when b  k). Substituting the ansatz into Eq. (D1a)
yields ε1 = −bγ, or
ε(t) ≈ −bγ(t − tpeak ).

(D3)

With this, we can obtain an approximation for i around
the peak. From Eq. (D1b), we know that
d log(i)
= bs(t) − k = kε(t),
dt

(D4)

which can easily be solved. Together with the condition
i(tpeak ) = γ, we obtain


1
2
i(t) ≈ γ exp − bkγ(t − tpeak ) .
(D5)
2

Note that (as compared to Eq. (C2)) we use here the normalized distribution, without the diminishing factor due
to extinction, in order to extract the reduction strictly
due to desynchronization. We have also set htpeak i to
0 without loss of generality, as a different value would
simply shift ī(t) by the corresponding time.
The integral in Eq. (D7) cannot be integrated in closed
est
form. We therefore replace PSIR
by a normal distribution
2
N (0, σ ) with the same variance σ 2 = π 2 /[6(b − k)2 ]. It
is useful to note that, as for the normal distribution, the
variance completely determines the shape of the Gumbel
distribution in Eq. (C1), which means that the systematic error introduced by this replacement is parameter
independent. Finally, we can calculate

The maximum of the resulting time course occurs at
t = 0 (due to our arbitrary choice of the mean for
tpeak ) and is ī(0) = γ/α. Since the expected peak value
without desynchronization is γ, desynchronization reduces this peak value by a factor of α−1 . According to
Eq. (D8), α itself depends on γ, which in turn is a function of R0 = b/k. Using the well known approximation
γ = 1 − [1 + log(R0 )]/R0 20 , which is valid as long as
S ≈ N initially, we rewrite α as

Now that we have an approximation for i(t) near the
peak, we can calculate how these time courses add up
across individual sub-populations, by assuming that they
all have the shape (D5), with the peak time tpeak stochastically distributed according to Eq. (C2). Defining

where each i(tjpeak ; t) represents a time course as in

sub-populations in the limit Ns → ∞:

(D10)
(D11)

exist. The first one signifies that there is no peak
reduction due to desynchronization for R0 → ∞,
consistent with the disappearance of the stochastic
phase at the beginning of the dynamics. The second
limit indicates a finite reduction by a factor ≈ 0.7407
towards R0 = b/k = 1. Since the time scales of both
the stochastic fluctuations and the deterministic peak
behavior diverge for R0 → 1 (and are ill-defined for
R0 = 1), this means that they must exhibit identical scaling behavior in order for neither of them to
dominate. In between the two extremes, 1/α increases
monotonically with R0 , which implies that the maximum
reduction that can be achieved by desynchronization

11
is about 26% and is reached close to R0 = 1. It is
important to note, however, that several assumptions
even about the deterministic time course (for example,
the value of γ) break down when R0 is so close to
1 that γ becomes of order 1/N , so a fully stochastic

treatment would be needed to fully capture this regime.
This does not limit the validity of the results in the
regime we are interested in, i.e. where sub-populations
still exhibit clear deterministic outbreaks (or extinction).
