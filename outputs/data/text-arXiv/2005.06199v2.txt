Abstract
The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS–coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has raised important questions about viral origin, mechanisms of zoonotic transfer to
humans, whether companion or commercial animals can act as reservoirs for infection, and
why there are large variations in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibilities across animal species.
Powerful in silico modelling methods can rapidly generate information on newly emerged
pathogens to aid countermeasure development and predict future behaviours.
Here we report an in silico structural homology modelling, protein-protein docking, and
molecular dynamics simulation study of the key infection initiating interaction between the
spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 and its target, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from
multiple species. Human ACE2 has the strongest binding interaction, significantly greater
than for any species proposed as source of the virus. Binding to pangolin ACE2 was the
second strongest, possibly due to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD)
being identical to pangolin CoV spike RDB. Except for snake, pangolin and bat for which
permissiveness has not been tested, all those species in the upper half of the affinity range
(human, monkey, hamster, dog, ferret) have been shown to be at least moderately permissive
to SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting a correlation between binding affinity and
permissiveness. Our data indicates that the earliest isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were
surprisingly well adapted to human ACE2, potentially explaining its rapid transmission.

Introduction
The devastating impact of COVID-19 infections caused by SARS–coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has stimulated unprecedented international activity to discover effective vaccines and
drugs for this and other pathogenic coronaviruses.1-4 It has also raised important questions
about the mechanisms of zoonotic transfer of viruses from animals to humans, whether
companion animals or those used for commercial purposes can act as reservoirs for infection,
and the reasons for the large variations in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility across animal species.57

Understanding how viruses move between species may help us prevent or minimize similar

events in the future. Methods that elucidate the molecular basis for differences in species
susceptibilities of may also shed light on why different human sub-groups exhibit differences
in susceptibilities.8
The most important features of SARS-CoV-2 are its spike protein (S protein) and a
functional polybasic cleavage site at the S1–S2 boundary.9 The SARS-CoV-2 spike monomer
consists of a fusion peptide, two heptad repeats, an intracellular domain, N-terminal domain,
two subdomains and a transmembrane region.10 The angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) was identified as the main receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, as it is for SARS
CoV, binding to which is a critical initiating event for infection. ACE2 is relatively
ubiquitous in humans, existing in cell membranes in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and
intestines. It consists of an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal
amino acid transporter domain.
Non-human species vary markedly in their susceptibility to SARS-Cov-27,11,12 and their
ACE2 receptor binding domains also differ substantially. The phylogenetic tree showing
relatedness of ACE2 proteins across selected animal species is illustrated in Supplementary
Figure 1. Several species, notably pangolin, bat and snake, have been postulated as a source
or intermediate host for SARS-Cov-2.11,13,14

denoted by the red bar in the sequence alignments

We and others15,16 postulate that variation in ACE2 structures between species will
determine the binding strength of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and suggest which species are
permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, the low binding affinity of SARS S
protein for mouse ACE2 has been postulated as the reason mice are largely non-permissive to
SARS infection. Direct measurement of the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to
ACE2 (e.g. using cell lines transfected with ACE2 proteins from different species) would be
very useful but is time consuming, and purified or recombinant ACE2 proteins from all
relevant animal species are not yet available.
Here we show how fast, efficient in silico structural modelling and docking algorithms
from structure-based drug design can be used to determine the relative binding affinities of
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein for ACE2, across multiple common and exotic animal species.1719

We provide novel insights into the species-specific nature of this interaction and impute

which species might be permissive for SARS-CoV-2 that may help elucidate the origin of
SARS-CoV-2 and the mechanisms for its zoonotic transmission.

Results and Discussion
The results of docking the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2
receptors of various species using the HDOCK server, refined by MD simulations, are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The calculated binding energies for the interactions of SARSCoV-2 with ACE2 from the species studied are summarized in Table 2, and the MMPBSA
binding energies are listed for comparison. The energies calculated by equation 1 and those
from the MMPBSA algorithm (see Materials and Methods) correlated strongly (r2=0.76) but
the energies correlated poorly with sequence similarity (r2=0.27). The Kendall tau rank
correlation for the two different methods of calculating binding energies was 0.94. Also
shown is the observed and predicted SARS-CoV-2 susceptibilities of the species from
analysis of phylogenetic clustering and sequence alignment with currently known ACE2s
utilized by SARS-CoV-2, as described by Qiu et al.20 (Supplementary Figure 4) For
comparison, we show the interaction energies of the S and ACE2 proteins for each species
calculated by Wu et al. using an automatic docking method, ICM-Pro21 (no subsequent MD
refinement), and observational in vivo data on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and disease
symptoms in the species, where this has been reported. The interaction energies calculated by
Wu et al., based only on docking calculations, predict that monkey, hamster, tiger and bat
have higher affinity than human ACE2 for the spike protein which is clearly not consistent
with the known infectivities of the species in Table 2. This suggests that more sophisticated
computational methods are required to obtain binding affinities more consistent with
observation, as in the work presented here and by others, e.g.22
While this paper was being prepared, Rodrigues et al. published a similar study that used
the docking method HADDOCK to estimate the relative strength of binding affinities of
SARS-Cov-2 spike protein for ACE2 proteins of 30 species.22 The docking experiments were
followed by short MD simulations. This study found 18 species had higher affinity than the
human ACE2, including dog, pangolin, ferret, Siberian tiger, horseshoe bat, civet, hamster
and guinea pig but also goldfish, sheep, cat, horse and rabbit. Goldfish (no known
permissiveness of infection with SARS-Cov-2) had the second highest affinity after dog. The
authors stated that, despite their method having some discrimination between species that are
susceptible and those that are not, their predictions were not entirely correct. For example,
they rank guinea pig ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 negative) as a better receptor for SARS-CoV-2
RBD than for human, cat, horse, or rabbit ACE2 (all SARS-CoV-2 positive species), despite
experiments showing that there is negligible binding between the two proteins.23 One

5

explanation may be that their MD simulations were short (simulation time not listed) and it
longer simulations like those used in this study are needed to obtain more accurate ranking of
the binding affinities.
Other relevant papers were also published while this paper was in preparation and
review. Recently, Damas et al. published an analysis of ACE2 sequences from 410 vertebrate
species, including 252 mammals, to study the probability that ACE2 could be used as a
receptor by SARS-CoV-2.15 They classed the species into five risk groups. Man, apes, and
monkeys were in the very high-risk group while Chinese hamsters, whales and porpoises
were prominent examples of species in the high-risk group.
Note added in proof: While this paper was undergoing review, a highly relevant paper
was published in Scientific Reports (5 Oct) by Lam et al.24 on the species specificity of spikeACE2 interaction. This provides validation of our computational approach and results we
obtained on the relative binding affinities of non-human species. As with our study they used
MODELLER to generate ACE2 structures for difference species and selected the best refined
model using DOPE scores. They calculated free energy differences, DDG, between human
ACE2 binding and that of non-human species ACE2 to SARS-Cov-2 spike using free energy
perturbation methods. However, energy differences they calculated are similar to those we
calculated. Unfortunately, Lam et al. did not report the DDG for the most important species,
pangolin, making our study significant in reporting this binding energy.

Golden hamsters, cattle and cats were members of the medium risk group and dogs, horses and
bats were in the low risk group. Pangolins, ferrets, mice, and minks were assigned to the very low
risk group in their analyses. The susceptibility predictions from these studies also do not correlate
well with observations, consist with the low correlation between binding energies and sequence
noted above.
Two additional, recent studies have some relevant to our study. Spinello et al. published a
detailed, microsecond molecular dynamics simulation of the key molecular interactions driving the
higher affinity/specificity of SARS-CoV-2 toward ACE2 as compared to SARS-CoV.34 However,
this study did not compare the affinities of non-human ACE2 proteins for the SARS-Cov-2 spike
protein. Subsequently, Wang and co-workers published a complementary MD study comparing the
interactions of SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov spike proteins with the human ACE2 protein with 200
ns simulations.35 They analysed the receptor binding of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of key electrostatic
interactions, networks of hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the RBD. Again, no
other species were considered in the study.
The key interacting residues of ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Table 1) were
broadly consistent with these previous studies 34-36. Conserved amino acids in ACE2 of most
species were largely those interacting with the S protein. PHE28, ASN330, ASP355 and ARG357
were conserved in all the species and all interacted with the spike protein. TYR41, LYS353,
ALA386 and ARG393 were conserved and interacting in all species except bat, mouse, ferret and
pangolin. Residues interacting with the S protein in ACE2 from Ophiophagus hannah (King cobra)
were least conserved, consistent with its low sequence similarity to human ACE2.
Computed binding affinities suggest that SARS-Cov-2 S protein is optimized for human ACE2
Identifying species permissive to SARS-CoV-2 is very important for identifying intermediate hosts
and potential source of the original virus, and for developing infection models for testing of
COVID-19 drugs and vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 traces back to the human, civet, and bat SARS CoV
strains, all of which use the ACE2 protein of each relevant species for cellular entry.37-39 The
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS CoV sequences have only 72% identity in the RBD regions showing they
are only distantly related, even though they bind the same ACE2 receptor. The closest coronavirus
to SARS-CoV-2 identified to date is the bat CoV, RaTG13, but it has a different spike protein that
lacks the polybasic furin cleavage site and uses a different RBD. The RBD of pangolin CoV is
most similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, meaning that much of early interpretation of the ancestry of
SARS-CoV-2 was based on this sequence analysis (Figure 1).
Our structure-based approach revealed some surprisingly results, contrasting with to those from
sequence based analyses. Conspicuously, the predicted binding between SARS-CoV-2 S protein
10

and ACE2 was strongest overall for humans than for any species studied. The predicted strength of
SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding to ACE2 being human > pangolin > dog > monkey > hamster >
ferret > cat> tiger > bat > civet > horse > cow > snake > mouse ACE2.
Spike protein mutations are rare, especially in the receptor binding domain (RBD) that interacts
with ACE2. For the SARS-Cov-2 S protein, only three mutational sites, V367F, G476S, and
V483A, have been identified within the RBD domain. Of these, only G476S occurs directly at the
binding interface of RBD and the peptidase domain of ACE2 and its incidence and geographic
spread is very small.40 This minimal mutation in the spike RBD during the history of the pandemic
suggests that the spike RBD was already optimally adapted to bind human ACE2. This finding is
surprising as, typically, a virus exhibits the highest affinity for receptors in its original host species,
presumed by most to be bat, with a lower initial affinity for the receptor of any new host species
such as humans. Then as the virus mutates and adapts to its new host species, the binding affinity
might be expected to increase over time. Since our calculations are based on SARS-Cov-2 S
sequences samples isolated in December and hence from very early in the outbreak, the finding that
the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein is higher for human ACE2 than for any other putative host
species was unexpected.
This very high affinity for human ACE2 was confirmed very recently (July 10) in a preprint by
Alexander et al.41 who also studied the RBD of spike-ACE2 for several species and reported that
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence is optimal for binding to human ACE2 compared to other species.
They also described this as a remarkable finding that underlies the high transmissibility of the SARCov-2 virus amongst humans. These results are also consistent with a recent report comparing
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that found a number of differences in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that
made it a much more potent binder to human ACE2 through the introduction of numerous hydrogen
bonding and hydrophobic networks35 helping explain the efficient and rapid transmission SARSCoV-2 through the human population, once a presumed cross-over event occurred in or around
November 2019.
Interestingly, as shown in Table 1, pangolin and human ACE2 are closest in binding energy
despite being structurally different and only sharing 10 of 16 interacting residues at the SARS-CoV2 RBD. This similarity of binding energy is interesting as pangolins have previously been imputed
as a potential intermediate host to explain the spill-over of a putative bat coronavirus to humans.
However, most of the pangolin ACE2 RBD differences are conservative replacements of residues in
the human ACE2 RBD viz. Q24E, D30E, D38E, L79I that are likely to make similar contributions
to the binding interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike. The main differences are the lack of S19
interaction and the replacement of H34 by S34 in pangolin ACE2. However, the MD structures

11

show that the OH moiety in the sidechain of S24 lies in the same region, and can make similar
interactions, as the NH moiety in the imidazole sidechain of H34.
Affinity of ACE2 from non-human species
SARS-CoV-2 also recognizes ACE2 from a variety of animal species, including palm civet,
the intermediate host for SARS-CoV.42 The calculated binding energies of SAR-CoV-2 S protein
with ACE2 from other species is in general agreement with the relatively limited amount of
published information on species infectivity. Predicted binding to monkey ACE2 is 2.4 kcal/mol
lower than for human ACE2, despite all 16 ACE2 binding residues being the same This relatively
small binding energy difference appears to reside in structural changes outside the RBD. Several
studies have reported the susceptibility of various animal species to SARS-CoV-25,43,44 with
susceptible species such as macaques, hamsters and ferrets used as animal models of SARS-CoV-2
infection.29,45,46
Infected young cynomolgus macaques expressed viral RNA in nasal swabs but did not develop
overt clinical symptoms, whereas aged animals showed higher viral RNA loads, some weight loss,
and rapid respiration associated with moderate interstitial pneumonia and virus replication in upper
and lower respiratory tract.46,47 Hamster ACE2 had a high predicted binding to the S protein,
similar to that for monkey ACE2, with hamster ACE2 sharing 14 out of 16 binding residues with
human ACE2. The model predicts that hamster should be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection
based on the strong binding of SARS-Cov-2 S protein for hamster ACE2 (Table 2). Syrian hamsters
have been shown to exhibit clinical and histopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2 that closely
mimic human upper and lower respiratory tract infections, with high virus shedding and ability to
transmit to naïve contact animals, 29 consistent with the model predictions. This high susceptibility
to SARS-CoV infection of Syrian hamsters makes them one of the best animal models of infection.
Ferrets are also permissive to SARS CoV infection, and our modelling data indicated that SARSCoV-2 has a similar binding energy to ferret and hamster ACE2 (Table 2). Consistent with our
model data, ferrets are permissive to infection with SARS-CoV-2, with high virus titre in the upper
respiratory tract, virus shedding, infected ferrets showing acute bronchiolitis although without
severe disease or death, and active transmission to naïve ferrets through direct contact.44,45
There is inefficient virus replication of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in mice making them
unsuitable as models to test SARS or COVID-19 vaccines or drugs. 48 Mice only became
permissive for SARS infection when made transgenic for human ACE2 e.g. Golden et al. recently
reported that transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 become highly susceptible to SARS-CoV2.49 Cat and tiger ACE2 were shown by our model to have similar binding affinity for SARS-CoV2 S protein and both these species have been shown to be permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
12

Similarly, our data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 binds with relatively high affinity to dog ACE2
suggesting that dogs may be susceptible to infection. In the case of companion animals that live in
close proximity to humans, Shen at al. found that that SARS-CoV-2 could be efficiently transmitted
in cats and dogs 50 while Shi et al. reported that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs,
chickens, and ducks, but that ferrets and cats were permissive to infection.31 Temmam et al. tested 9
cats and 12 dogs living in close contact with their owners, two of whom tested positive for SARSCoV-2 and 11 of 18 others showed clinical signs of COVID-19 but no antibodies against SARSCoV-2 were detectable in their blood using an immunoprecipitation assay.51 Goumeniu et al.
published an editorial querying the role of dogs in the Lombardy COVID-19 outbreak and
recommended use of computational docking experiments to provide evidence for, or against
infection of dogs.52 Our model data suggesting that dog ACE2 might be permissive for SARS-CoV2 binding and infection is therefore consistent with anecdotal reports of dogs being infected with
SARS-CoV-2. Genetic and other factors could underlie the apparent inconsistent reporting of
susceptibility of dogs to COVID-19 clinical infection.
Implications for the intermediate animal vector for SARS-Cov-2
Bats have been suggested as the original host species of SARS-Cov-2 infections in humans,
with pangolins acting as an intermediate animal vector. Bat CoV RaTG13 has the highest sequence
similarity to SARS-CoV-2, with 96% whole-genome identity (50)., but does not possess neither the
furin cleavage site or the pangolin RBD seen in SARS-CoV-2. Could SARS-CoV-2 be an as-yet
unidentified bat virus? Although bats carry many coronaviruses, no evidence of a direct relative of
SARS-CoV-2 in bat populations has so far been found. As highlighted by our data, the binding
affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for bat ACE2 is considerably lower than for human ACE2 and human
ACE2 has been shown to not to bind the RaTG13 spike 53. This suggests that even if SARS-CoV-2
did originally arise from a bat precursor, it must have spent considerable time in another host
wherein it adapted its S protein to bind better to the host ACE2. This also resulted in acquiring
higher affinity for human ACE2 while lowering its affinity to the original bat ACE2. There are
currently no known explanations for how or where this transition to generate the ultimate SARSCoV-2 spike protein could have occurred. Evidence of direct human infection by bat coronaviruses
or other viruses is rare, with transmission typically involving an intermediate host. For example,
SARS-CoV was shown to be transmitted from bats to civet cats and then to humans. The S protein
must acquire new mutations to enable this transition to occur, first to increase its affinity for civet
ACE2 and then to increase its affinity for human ACE2. To date, a virus directly related to SARSCoV-2 has not been identified in bats or any other non-human species, making its origins unclear.
Moreover, Wrobel et al. reported a structural biology study of the bat virus and SARS-Cov-2 and
13

reported the experimental binding affinities of human ACE2 for the S proteins of these viruses.53
They concluded that, although the structures of human SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13 S proteins
are similar, the human S protein has a more stable pre-cleavage form, and the human ACE2 binding
kD was 68±9 nM while RaTG13 bound human ACE2 with a kD >40 µM. They observed that
cleavage at the furin-cleavage site decreases the overall stability of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and
fosters the open conformation required for S to bind to the ACE2 receptor. They concluded that
their data indicate that a bat virus would not bind effectively to human ACE2 receptor and would be
unlikely to infect humans. Early in the COVID-19 outbreak it was suggested that snakes may also
be an intermediate vector. ACE2 of turtle and snake has very low homology to human ACE2 and
SARS-CoV-2 was shown not to bind to reptile ACE2, making snakes unlikely intermediate hosts
for SARS-CoV-2. 14
The pangolin ACE2, despite having lower sequence similarity to human ACE2 (86%) than
other tested species (e,g. monkey ACE2 - 97% similarity to human), had the most similar binding
affinity to that of human ACE2. However, the predicted binding strength of SARS-CoV-2 S protein
to pangolin ACE2 was lower than to human ACE2, with the difference being highly significant
(two-tailed p = 0.0013). All other binding affinities were substantially lower then human and
pangolin ACE2 and were significant at the >>99.99% confidence level. It was reported recently that
a coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins shared the same RDB sequence as SARS-CoV-2,
which raised the possibility that pangolins may have acted as the intermediate vector between bats
and humans. Although it has the same spike RBD as SARS-CoV-2, pangolin-CoV is not closely
related to SARS-CoV-2 overall, with <90% sequence similarity across its whole genome.

25

It is

noteworthy that the common spike RBD in both pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is able to bind
strongly to both pangolin and human ACE2, despite significant differences in the sequences of the
ACE2 RDB (only 63% of residues are common (Table 1)). Xiao reported a pangolin-CoV that has
100%, 98.6%, 97.8% and 90.7% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-2 in the E, M, N and S
proteins.26 They surprisingly reported the RBD of the pangolin S protein to be almost identical to
that of SARS-CoV-2 despite 4 of the 10 residues interacting with ACE2 being different viz. H34S,
L79I, M82N and G354H. They suggested pangolins as potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV2. Additionally, pangolin CoV isolated from Malayan pangolins from two different regions in China
showed differences in the residues interacting with human ACE2.25 Pangolin-CoV was detected in
17 out of the 25 infected Malayan pangolins that that showed clinical signs and histological
changes, and had antibodies against pangolin-CoV that also recognised the S protein of SARSCoV-2. Another origin possibility might be that a pangolin was simultaneously co-infected with a
bat ancestor to SARS-CoV-2 and a pangolin CoV. This could allow a recombination event to occur
whereby the spike RBD of the pangolin virus was inserted into the bat CoV, thereby conferring the
14

bat CoV with high binding for both pangolin and human ACE2. Such recombination events are
known to occur with other RNA viruses and can explain creation of some pandemic influenza
strains54. Nevertheless, such events are by necessity rare as they require coinfection of the one host
at exactly the same time. Most importantly, if such a recombination event had occurred in
pangolins it would be expected to have similarly triggered an epidemic spread of the new highly
permissive SARS-CoV-2-like virus among pangolin populations, such as we now see occurring
across the human population. Currently there is no evidence of such a widespread pangolin SARSCoV-2 like outbreak, making this scenario less likely. Of course, some pangolins might have been
protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection by the existence of neutralising antibodies cross-protective
against both pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given their close RBD similarity. Notably, all
pangolin coronaviruses identified so far lack the furin-like S1/S2 cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein that facilitates its rapid spread through human populations.
The high affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein for human ACE2 may be explicable if a
recombination event took place in the past between a SARS-CoV-2 progenitor virus and pangolin
CoV that resulted in insertion of the pangolin CoV RBD into the SARS-CoV-2 genome. However,
the SARS-CoV-2 genome was recently reported to exhibit no evidence of recent recombination,
arguing against this possibility.55 Also, as he pangolin-CoV S protein does not have the furin
cleavage site that is a prominent feature of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein,51 this argues against
pangolins being the intermediate vector for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans. The major
similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolin-CoV lies in the RBD residues in the S protein that SARSCoV-2 acquired by some unknown mechanism. As coronaviruses from nonhuman species with
similar ACE2 receptors have not been sampled extensively, it is possible that a direct or
intermediate animal source has yet to be found. This would preclude identification of evolutionary
changes immediately prior to or during the jump to humans.
Gain of function (GoF) mutations occur in viruses that can lead to pandemics. For example,
GoF mutations in influenza virus are associated with mammalian transmissibility, increased
virulence for humans, and evasion of existing host immunity.54 The conditioning of viruses to
humans as pandemics progress is well recognized. Phylodynamic analyses of the COVID-19
genomes estimated the date for the most recent common ancestor from the start to middle of
December, consistent with the earliest reported date 1st December 2019 for the initial cluster of
pneumonia cases.56 This study concluded, based on available genome sequence data, that the
current epidemic has been driven entirely by human to human transmission at least since December.
As the SARS-CoV-2 structure that we employed was obtained from viruses collected early in the
outbreak, it is not clear how these early strains of SARS-CoV-2 developed such a high affinity for
human ACE2. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD previously evolved by selection on a
15

human-like ACE2. Notably, pangolin ACE2 bears major differences in its RBD to human ACE2.
Therefore its is surprising that pangolin-CoV has a similar RBD to SARS-CoV-2 that forms the
basis for implicating pangolins directly or indirectly in the origins of SARS-CoV-2. The fact that
pangolin CoVs can use human ACE2 for cell entry suggests that pangolin CoVs could represent a
source of future human coronavirus pandemics if they were to gain the SARS-CoV-2 furin
cleavage site.
Given the seriousness of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is imperative that all efforts be
made to identify the original source of the virus. One question to be addressed is whether the virus
is completely natural and was transmitted to humans by an intermediate animal vector, or whether it
came from a recombination event that occurred inadvertently or intentionally in a laboratory
handling coronaviruses, with the new virus being inadvertently released into the local human
population. This is of key importance given the ability to use such information to help prevent any
similar outbreak in the future. The one positive to our observation that SARS-CoV-2 already has
optimised high binding to human ACE2, providing little selective pressure for mutations in the
spike RBD to further increase binding affinity. Thus, a vaccine that induces neutralising antibody to
the spike RBD may remain effective long-term, and not need to be modified regularly like influenza
vaccines to keep up with RBD mutations.

Materials and Methods
Homology modelling of S protein and ACE2 from multiple species. As no three-dimensional structure of
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was available at the commencement of the project, we generated a homology structure
the sequence retrieved from NCBI Genbank Database (accession number YP_009724390.1) in January 2020. A
PSI-BLAST search against the PDB database for template selection was performed and the x-ray structure of
SARS coronavirus S template (PDB ID 5XLR) was selected with 76.4% sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 S
protein. The sequence alignment and sequences of related bat and pangolin coronaviruses are shown in Figure 1.
The protein sequences of the ACE2 proteins for different species and full sequence alignment in are shown
in Supplementary Figure 2. The phylogenetic tree for ACE2 proteins from selected animal species is illustrated in
Supplementary Figure 1. Protein preparation and removal of non-essential and non-bridging water molecules for
docking studies and analysis of docked proteins was performed using the UCSF Chimera package
(https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/).57
The 3D-structures of the RBD of SARS-Cov-2 S and non-human ACE2 proteins were built using Modeller
9.23 (https://salilab.org/modeller/)58 using the SARS S protein template to generate the homology model of
SARS-Cov-2 S. The ACE2 receptors of selected species were similarly homology modelled using the following
template structures – 1R42 (human ACE2), 3CSI (human glutathione transferase) and 3D0G (ACE2 structure
from spike protein receptor-binding domain from the 2002-2003 SARS coronavirus human strain complexed with
human-civet chimeric receptor ACE2) (Supplementary Table 1). Template similarity is important for model
building the model; the sequence of Macaca fascicularis (monkey, accession number A0A2K5X283) was 97%

16

similar to that of human ACE2 while Ophiophagus hannah (king cobra) had a much lower similarity of 61% this
template. The quality of the generated models was evaluated using the GA341 score 59 and DOPE ((Discrete
Optimized Protein Energy) method scores60, and the models assessed using SWISS-MODEL structure assessment
server (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/assess).61 Structures with the lowest DOPE score were refined by MD
simulations (vide infra) and used for further analysis.
The modelled structures were also assessed for quality control using Ramachandran Plot and molprobity
scores in SWISSModel. The Ramachandran plot checks the stereochemical quality of a protein by analysing
residue-by-residue geometry and overall structure geometry and visualizing energetically allowed regions for
backbone dihedral angles ψ against φ of amino acid residues in protein structure. The Ramachandran score of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was 90% in the binding region and the molprobity score was 3.17. The
Ramachandran score of the percentage of amino acid residues in the various species ACE2 that fall into the
energetically favoured region ranged from 96-99% (Supplementary Table 2). The predicted ACE2 structures and
Ramachandran plots for each species are summarized in Supplementary Figure 3. The molprobity provides
evaluation of model quality at both the global and local level, this combines protein quality score that reflects the
crystallographic resolution of a model.62 It is a log-weighted combination of the number of serious atom clashes
per 1000 atoms, percentage Ramachandran not favoured, and percentage bad side-chain rotamers. A good
molprobity score is one that is equal to or lower than the crystallographic resolution. For reference, the
MolProbity score for the x-ray structures of the templates (PDB IDs) were: 1R42= 3.01; 3SCI=3.14; 3D0G=2.74
and 6M17=1.99. The Ramachandran and Molprobity scores show that all the built structures were of good quality
and suitable for use in further studies.
The structure of the SARS-Cov-2 S protein was published subsequently (e.g. PDB ID 6VXX and 6VYB). 63
Figure 2 shows the very high structural similarity of our homology modelled spike protein structure with the EM
structures (PDB ID 6LZG (RBD) and 6VYB (open state)) with RMSD of 0.36 Å.

Docking of SARS-Cov-2 S protein with ACE2 proteins. These homology modelled ACE2 structures were
docked against SARS-CoV-2 S protein structure using a state-of-the-art package HDOCK
(http://hdock.phys.hust.edu.cn/).64,65 This performs rigid-body docking by mapping the receptor and ligand
molecules onto grids. Molecular docking was performed on the homology modelled SARS-CoV-2 S protein and
human and animal ACE2 proteins using the hybrid docking method because attempts to use the template-free
docking method with the structures generated by Modeller were unsatisfactory. The hybrid method used the
structural template for the complex (PDB ID 6M17) to generate the results reported here. All docking poses were
ranked using an energy-based scoring function.
The hybrid docking procedure may potentially introduce bias into the structures of the S protein bound to
ACE2 from non-human species because it uses a human ACE2 complex x-ray structure as a template. To check
for possible bias, the ACE2 structures generated by HDOCK were compared with those generated independently
by Modeller. The Ca backbones of the ACE2 structures aligned with RMSD values between 0.5-0.8 Å (see
Supplementary Table 3), exhibiting very strong structural similarities. Additionally, complexes were subjected to
molecular dynamics simulation to wash out any template-induced bias.
Molecular dynamics simulation of docked complexes. The final docked SARS-Cov-2 spike/ACE2 protein
complexes were optimized using the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field in GROMACS2020
(http://www.gromacs.org/).66 Simulations were carried out using the GPU accelerated version of the program with
the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field and implementing periodic boundary conditions in ORACLE server. Docked
complexes were immersed in a truncated octahedron box of TIP3P water molecules. The solvated box was further
neutralized with Na+ or Cl− counter ions using the tleap program. Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) was employed to
calculate the long-range electrostatic interactions. The cut-off distance for the long-range van der Waals (VDW)
energy term was 12.0 Å. The system was minimized without restraints. We applied 2500 cycles of steepest
descent minimization followed by 5000 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization. After system optimization, the
MD simulations was initiated by gradually heating each system in the NVT ensemble from 0 to 300 K for 50 ps
using a Langevin thermostat with a coupling coefficient of 1.0/ps and with a force constant of 2.0 kcal/mol·Å2 on
the complex. Finally, a production run of 100 ns of MD simulation was performed under a constant temperature
of 300 K in the NPT ensemble with periodic boundary conditions for each system. During the MD procedure, the
SHAKE algorithm was applied to all covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms. The time step was 2 fs. The
structural stability of the complex was monitored by the RMSD and RMSF values of the backbone atoms of the
entire protein. Finally, the free energies of binding were calculated for all simulated docked structures.
Calculations were also performed for up to 500 ns on human ACE2 to ensure that 100ns is sufficiently long
for convergence. Multiple production runs with different starting random seeds were used to estimate binding
energy uncertainties for the strongest binding ACE2 structures – human, bat, and pangolin. All complexes
stabilized during simulation with RMSD fluctuations converging to a range of 0.5 to 0.8 nm. The RMSD values
for superimposition of the Ca backbones of each ACE2 structure before and after 100ns simulation was 1.2±0.1
Å, showing significant movement away from the initial HDOCK structures.
We found that the complex had stabilised after 50ns so considered that 100ns was an adequate simulation
time. We also compared 100ns simulated structures of the ACE2 proteins from all species against those generated
by homology modelling (most x-ray structures were not available) and found the RMSD values for Ca alignments

18

between 0.5-0.8 Å. This suggests that any memory of the human template has been removed or minimized. We
also compared the structures generated independently by homology (Modeller) and HDOCK (Supplementary
Table 3) and they agreed very well (RMSD< 1Å)

Calculation of binding free energies of complexes. The binding free energies of the protein‐protein complexes
were evaluated in two ways. The traditional method is to calculate the energies of solvated SARS-CoV-2 S and
ACE2 proteins and that of the bound complex proteins and derive the binding energy by subtraction.
ΔG (binding, aq) = G (complex, aq) –G (spike, aq) –G (ACE2, aq)

(1)

We also calculated binding energies using the molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) tool in GROMACS that is derived from the nonbonded interaction energies of the complex.67,68 The method
is also widely used method for binding free energy calculations. The binding free energies of the protein
complexes were analysed during equilibrium phase from the output files of 100 ns MD simulations. The
g_mmpbsa tool in GROMACS was used after molecular dynamics simulations, the output files obtained were used
to post-process binding free energies by the single-trajectory MM-PBSA method. Specifically, for a non-covalent
binding interaction in the aqueous phase the binding free energy,
ΔG (bind,aqu) = ΔG (bind,vac) + ΔG (bind,solv)

(2)

where ΔG (bind,vac) is the binding free energy in vacuum, and ΔG(bind,solv) is the solvation free energy change
upon binding: –
ΔG (bind,solv) = G (R:L, solv) - G (R,solv) - G (L,solv)

(3)

where G (R:L,solv), G (R,solv) and G (L,solv) are solvation free energies of complex, receptor and ligand,
respectively.69
Free energy decomposition analyses were also performed by MM-PBSA decomposition to get a detailed
insight into the interactions between the ligand and each residue in the binding site. The binding interaction of
each ligand–residue pair includes three terms: the van der Waals contribution, the electrostatic contribution, and
the solvation contribution.
As the simulations are very lengthy, we only ran multiple simulations for the species proposed as
intermediate hosts and potential sources of the original virus, human, pangolin, bat and snake to estimate the
uncertainty in the binding energies. As the ACE2 proteins for all species were extremely similar, we expected that
these simulation error estimates would be of the same order for all other species. The predicted binding energies
for these other species were significantly lower than those of human ACE2. We also used a statistical test to
calculate the probability of the pangolin and human ACE2 affinities being different.

Trobe University and Flinders University.
