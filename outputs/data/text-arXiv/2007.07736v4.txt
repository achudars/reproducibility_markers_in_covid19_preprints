Abstract
3CL-Pro (or M-Pro) is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, acting as a homodimer, is responsible for the
cleavage of the large polyprotein 1ab transcript in proteins acting on viral growth and replication. 3CLPro has been one of the most studied SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the subject of therapeutic
interventions, targeting its catalytic domain. A number of drug candidates have been reported,
including some natural products. Here, we investigated in silico, through binding and molecular
dynamics simulations, the natural product space for the identification of candidates of 3CL-Pro
dimerization inhibitors. We report that fortunellin (acacetin 7-O-neohesperidoside), a natural
flavonoid O-glycoside, is a potent inhibitor of 3CL-Pro dimerization. A search of the ZINC natural
products database identified another 16 related molecules, including apilin and rhoifolin, with
interesting pharmacological properties. We propose that fortunellin and its structural analogs might
be the basis of novel pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements against SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID19 disease. Our findings are supported by the experimental literature.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December 2019,
and is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It became a global pandemic,
threatening the lives of millions of people belonging to sensitive health groups. Intense scientific effort
worldwide resulted in the identification of SARS-CoV-2 genomic structure, viral protein sequence and
structure and disease characteristics.[1,2] 3CL-Pro (or Mpro), the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, plays
a key role in polyprotein processing. This enzyme plays a vital role in cleaving the large polyprotein
1ab (replicase 1ab, ∼790 kDa) translated by the virus RNA, at 11 different sites, liberating proteins
indispensable for viral replication and proliferation, with a unique specificity, not found in any human
protease.[3] Therefore, it represents a preferential target for the development of a series of not toxic
inhibitors. The individual monomers of SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro are inactive; thus, inhibitors of its
dimerization are needed. The chemical space of natural products, and especially that of polyphenols,
has provided valuable candidate lead molecules in a number of diseases, including COVID-19.[4] Here,
we have interrogated this resource, in view of identifying potential candidates inhibiting the
dimerization of SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro. Herein, Fortunellin (acacetin 7-O-neohesperidoside), a natural
flavonoid O-glycoside, isolated from the fruits of Citrus japonica var. margarita (kumquat),[5] was
found as a lead compound, which, together with a series of 16 structurally related analogs, including
apilin and rhoifolin, could be used as the basis for the design of novel antiviral compounds.

Material and Methods
The Swiss Model Biospace contains 110 crystal structures of 3CL-Pro (July 2020), bound or not to
ligands, and deposited to the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/) with high structural
similarity (Table S1 in the Supplemental Material). Here, we base our docking study on the crystal
with reference 6YB7, in the absence of a ligand. For the study, ligands and their analogs were
retrieved from the ZINC database (http://zinc.docking.org/).[6] Fully flexible ligand binding on 3CL-

4
Pro by the GalaxyWeb server (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/), was performed as described previously.[7]
Molecular Dynamics (MD) studies were based on two unligated crystals (6YB7, 6LU7) [8] to increase
phase space sampling. Classical MD simulations of the 3CL-Pro monomer (60μs) described by the
Amber03 force field were performed in GROMACS 2020. Retrieved trajectories were further
analyzed by Markov state modeling (MSM).[9] Time-structure independent components analysis
(tICA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of our data, in PyEMMA. MSM gave the conformational
phase space of MPro, in two Collective Variables (CV-1/ CV-2) determined by the torsional angles of
residues 3, 4, 5, 6, 84, 135, 141, 164, 167, 171, 175, 178, 179, 180, 190, 195, 217, 284, 285, 286, 290,
291, 300, and 301. Please, refer to the Supplemental Material for a detailed description of the
methods used in this study and the detailed conformational space functions out of the MSM
analysis.

Results and Discussion
The Classical MD of the homodimer of 3CL-Pro (10μs), followed by 20μs enhanced sampling (parallel
tempering metadynamics at the well-tempered ensemble, PTmetaD-WTE method)[10], on the above
CV phase space, revealed three conformations (Figure 1A), at the minima of the free energy surface
(FES). The first conformation (C1) corresponds to the crystal structure of the dimer (monomer
distance 1.72-1.78 Å), while the other two (C2-C3) correspond to looser dimer structures with higher
(1.86-1.93 Å) distances among monomers, resulting in weakened monomer-monomer interactions.
The monomer distances have been calculated based on the minimum distances between residues on
the monomer-monomer interface (4, 10, 11, 14, 28, 139, 140, 147, 290, 298).[11]
We utilized the FTMap server [12] to identify binding hot spots, determine drugability and provide
information about fragment-based drug discovery on 3CL-Pro. The results of FTMap permit us to
design a minimal structure of a potential 3CL-Pro dimerization inhibitor. Interrogating the ZINC
database of natural products with this minimal structure, we have identified fortunellin (ZINC4349204,

5
Figure 1B) as a potential natural inhibitor of 3CL-Pro dimerization. Binding of fortunellin on the 3CLPro monomer (Figure 1C) revealed a high affinity binding (ΔG -13.9 kcal/mol) using the fully flexible
GalaxyWeb server, and strong interactions with 3CL-Pro amino acids (Leu32, Asp33, Asp34, Val35, Tyr37,
Gln83, Lys88, Tyr101, Lys102, Phe103, Val104, Arg105, Asp108, Phe159, Cys160, Asp176, Leu177 and Glu178). Despite
the fact that fortunellin does not bind at the dimerization interface, as defined by the residues 4, 10,
11, 14, 28, 139, 140, 147, 290, and 298, the binding might allosterically inhibit, or weaken the
formation of the active dimer, as indicated by the large-scale classical and enhanced sampling MD
simulations (see below). To increase the statistical significance of the docking studies, we have also
used the different poses of the monomeric 3CL-Pro MD solutions for 60 μs, at 1 ns interval (poses
were retrieved every 3 μs) as scaffolds for fortunellin binding. As shown, the affinity of fortunellin is
fluctuating around -12.3 kcal/mol (SD ±1.005 kcal/mol), and, after initial fluctuations, preceding
significant changes of the dimerization domain, as expressed by changes of the local RMSD value, as
compared to the crystal structure of 3CL-Pro, it stabilizes after 30 μs (see Supplemental Material Table
S2).
In Figures 1D-E, we present the MSM analysis of the equilibrium dynamics of MPro in the presence
and absence of fortunellin, respectively on the MSM refined CV phase space (CV-1/ CV-2). The C1-C3
minima are assigned in these graphs based on structural feature comparison with Figure 1A. Based on
MSM, we calculated that the transitions between the different states (C1-C3) occur at the average
time scales of 37.6ns (slow processes) and 3.5ns (fast processes) in the absence of fortunellin (Figure
1F). However, the average transition time scale in the presence of fortunellin drops to 1.42ns with
only fast transitions (Figure 1G). This significantly smaller time-interval results in greater energy
changes faster in the presence of fortunellin, blocking the trapping at certain states, and inhibiting the
formation of the dimer by sampling non-favorable monomer conformations, i.e. with greater distance
among monomers, that favor its dissociation. We note that the C1 minimum that is associated with
the crystal structure (active for dimerization) in Figure 1D, it is absent in Figure 1E, indicating that

6
fortunellin disfavors this state. Instead, C1 is replaced by an alternative protein state, indicated by the
purple area in Figure 1E.

comparison with Figure 1A. F-G. The transition times between the C1 to C3 minima are calculated in the absence (F) and in
the presence (G) of fortunellin.

The 3CL-Pro C44-P52 loop has been proposed to host mutations, however only at the T45, S46, E47,
L50 positions.[13] The latter are not listed as important residues in the 3CL-Pro/ fortunellin dynamics
analyzed by MSM (see Supplemental Material). This gives us confidence that fortunellin can target
3CL-Pro, even when 3CL-Pro is mutated. It appears therefore that the natural polyphenol fortunellin
is a good drug (or dietary supplement) candidate for combatting COVID-19 disease. The bulk of the

7
scientific effort targeting 3CL-Pro focuses on the discovery or repurposing of inhibitors of its enzymatic
activity. [14]. Here, we have instead directed our efforts toward the identification of (natural)
compounds, which could inhibit the dimerization of the enzyme. Previous studies have implicated
fortunellin as an activator of anti-oxidant enzymes (HO-1, SOD and CAT), through a direct action on
Nrf2 and AMPK pathways, considered as important to protect against oxidative stress.[15] In addition,
fortunellin was implicated as a cardioprotective factor in diabetic animals.[16] Here, we extend the
actions of this agent, by reporting a direct effect of fortunellin, impairing the dimerization of 3CL-Pro
SARS-CoV-2 protease, and therefore inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication and proliferation. Searching the
ZINC database for natural products with fortunellin as a bait, we have retrieved 16 natural compounds
with similar molecular properties, presented in Table S3 (Supplemental Material). Their absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) characteristics were evaluated in the SwissADME site,
and the results are shown in Supplemental Material Table S4. It derives that they are all water-soluble
compounds, with limited enteric and skin absorption, but they are non-toxic, as they are not predicted
to interact with the CYP drug metabolizing enzymes. Among them, apiin (ZINC3983878) and rhoifolin
(ZINC3978800) have been previously studied for their biological effects. For further information please
refer to the Supplemental Material section “Natural product Properties: the fortunellin – analogs”.
Our in-silico strategy identified a series of natural flavonoids – polyphenols (fortunellin, apiin,
rhoifolin), which, in the form of drugs or dietary supplements, might be an effective strategy against
the devastating SARS-CoV-2 infections, in humans.

Methods
Molecular Docking
SARS-CoV-2 main protease MPro and Ligand Preparation
The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 main protease MPro, in fasta format, was retrieved from the NCBI
protein database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/) and introduced to the Swiss Model
Biospace (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive).[1] The main SARS-CoV-2 protease MPro have
many available crystal structures and the system, presented in Supplemental Table 1. Codes
correspond to data stored in the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/).[2] In this work, we have
used the 6YB7 unliganded crystal, analyzed with X-ray diffraction. Monomers were extracted, using a
text editor.
Ligands were retrieved from the ZINC database (http://zinc.docking.org/),[3] in a canonical smiles
format. Novel molecules were designed in ChemBioDraw (v12.0, Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, free for
Academic use from the University of Cambridge). Then, pdb or mol2 files of the ligands were created
with the Open Babel program (http://openbabel.org).[4]

Ligand-MPro docking
SARS-CoV-2 main protease (in pdb format) and ligand(s) (in mol2 or pdb formats) were uploaded to
the GalaxyWebserver (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/) and a fully flexible docking (involving the receptor
and the ligand) was performed.[5–10] The server uses an algorithm, based on the GalaxyDock2
docking,[11] which, after an automatic prediction of the ligand binding pocket, permits a full
ligand/receptor flexibility during binding simulation. This step is followed by optimization and
subsequent refinement, through a specific algorithm named GalaxyRefine,[6,12] which permits a
protein-ligand structure refinement, by applying iterative side chain repacking and overall structure
relaxation.[6,13] The best solution (usually denoted as “Model 1”) was retained. The corresponding
pdb file (containing the MPro-ligand complex) was retrieved. The 3D structures of the liganded and
unliganded MPro were compared, using the UCSF Chimera 1.11.2 program,[14] available from
https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/. The same program was used for comparisons of the retrieved
solutions with available crystals

Simulation of MPro dimerization
1) Dimerization of MPro: The active form of the MPro SARS-CoV-2 main protease, is a homodimer,[15]
as a Cyclic-C2 (Global Symmetry) Homo-2-mer A2 (Global Stoichiometry).[16–19] Here, we used two
different docking programs to simulate the active dimer and we compare the obtained solutions with
the crystal 6YB7:
(1) We used the GalaxyWEB server, routine HOMOMER (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgibin/submit.cgi?type=HOMOMER) for the MPro protein oligomer structure prediction from a
monomer sequence or structure (Ologomeric state = 2). The server carries out template-based
modeling, ab initio docking or both, depending on the availability of proper oligomer templates, until
5 models are generated.[5]
(2) We used the Hex 8.0.8 program (http://hex.loria.fr/).[20,21] Hex 8.0.8, a specialized, locally
executed, program, for protein-protein, or protein-nucleic acid interactions, based on spherical

rotated protein complexes, taking into account both surface shape and electrostatic charge. Hex
returns, through a graphical user interface, a set of >100 solutions, with the corresponding ΔG values.
The input files for Hex 8.0.8 program are pdb files of MPro with or without ligand and the output file
is a pdb file that contains the simulated MPro dimer. The 3D structures of the monomer and dimer
structure of MPro from experimental crystal structures, GalaxyWEB server and Hex 8.0.8 program
were compared, using the UCSF Chimera 1.11.2 program. The same program was also used to
determine the dimerization interphase of the monomers.

Molecular Dynamics computational protocol
Model setup
The crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 main protease MPro, or 3CL-PRO (pdb codes 6LU7[22]
and 6YB7) were used as initial coordinates to build the models. The pdb structures refer to
one monomer without and with inhibitor, respectively. For consistency, the inhibitor was
removed from the crystal structure of MPro (6LU7).[22] Our choice of coordinates was based
on the completeness of the resolved MPro sequence and the quality of chains (at least 90%).
To build the MPro dimer, we structurally aligned either two 6lu7, or two 6yb7 monomers on
a reference dimer.[23] The protonation states of titratable residues were simulated at neutral
pH, thus all Glu, and Asp residues were left deprotonated, except Glu-290 which was
protonated, in accordance also with the PDB2PQR (propka 3.0 method, pH 7.3)
predictions.[24] His-41, His-163, His-172 and His-246 were protonated only at the Nε site. The
rest of His residues were protonated only at the Νδ sites, to maintain the hydrogen bonding
network within the crystal structures. All crystallographic water molecules are retained within
each crystal structure. Four samples were, thus prepared, in a consistent way (two
monomers, two dimers). The all-atom models, as defined previously, were embedded in
triclinic boxes of around 7.2nm x 11.2nm x 8.0nm (monomer), or 12.3nm x 12.3 nm x 12.3 nm
(dimer) in the x, y and z dimensions, respectively. Up to around 57000 TIP3P water
molecules[25] were used to hydrate each protein. Ion (K+, Cl-) concentration was set at the
value of 150 mM to mimic the physiological salt content for the monomer or dimer models,
in addition to zero, or excess concentrations of KCl, NaCl, CaCl2 at 0, 150, 300, 400 and 500
mM only for the monomer models. The various anionic strengths were only employed to
indirectly ‘enhance’ the sampled conformational space of the MPro. A surplus of K+ was also
added to neutralize the protein charges in each sample, resulting in simulation unit boxes of
62400 (monomer), or 181800 (dimer) atoms. The Amber03[26] protein force field was used
for the residues and ions. The Amber03 parameters for the natural products were derived
based on ACPYPE algorithm.[27]
Equilibration-Production Molecular Dynamics setup
The equilibration-relaxation for the all-atom systems is employed based on a published
protocol for water-soluble proteins.[28] This contains a steepest descend energy
minimization with a tolerance of 0.5 kJ mol-1 for 1000 steps, and a sequence of isothermal
(nVT), isothermal-isobaric (nPT) runs with the gradual relaxation of the constraints on protein

heavy atoms (from 104 in steps1-2 to 103 kJ mol-1 nm-2 in step-4) and Cα atoms (from 103 in
step-5, to 102 in step-6, 10 in step-7, 1 in step-8 and 0 kJ mol-1 nm-2 in step-9) for around 30
ns, with a time step of 1.0 fs (steps 1-4) and 2.0 fs (steps 5-9). In detail: (step-1) Constant
density and temperature (nVT) Brownian dynamics (BD) at 100 K for 50 ps that employs the
Berendsen thermostat,[29] with a temperature coupling constant at 1.0 fs. (steps 2-3) Two
short constant density (nVT) and constant pressure (nPT) runs for 100 ps each, with a weak
coupling Berendsen thermostat and barostat[29] at 100 K employing time coupling constants
of 0.1 ps for the temperature and isotropic 50.0 ps coupling for the pressure with a
compressibility of 4.6x10-5. (step-4) Heating from 100 to 250 K in a constant density ensemble
(nVT) for 3 ns employing the v-rescale thermostat,[30] with a time coupling constant of 0.1
ps. (step-5) Heating from 250 to 310K in a constant pressure ensemble (nPT) for 2 ns,
employing the v-rescale thermostat[30] and Berendsen barostat,[29] with time coupling
constants of 0.1 ps for the temperature and 2.0 ps for the pressure, removing also all but the
Cα-atom protein position restraints. (step-6) Equilibration at 310K (0.1 ps temperature

Equilibration at 310K (0.5 ps temperature coupling constant) for 5 ns (nPT, 1 atm, 2.0 ps
coupling constant for pressure). (step-9) Equilibration at 310K (0.5 ps temperature coupling
constant) for 10 ns (nPT, 1 atm, 2.0 ps coupling constant for pressure). The barostats –
thermostats employed for steps 6-9 were the same as in the production trajectories that
follow.
For the production all-atom classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), the Newton’s equations of
motion are integrated with a time step of 2.0 fs at 310K. All production simulations are run
with the leap-frog integrator in GROMACS 2020[31] for 3.0 μs each. They were performed at
the constant pressure nPT ensemble, with isotropic coupling (compressibility at 4.5x10-5)
employing the v-rescale thermostat[30] (310K, temperature coupling constant 0.5) and the
Parrinello-Rahman barostat[32] (1 atm, pressure coupling constant 2.0). Details for
parameters can be found in earlier work.[28] The first 500 ns were considered further
equilibration from each independent trajectory per sample, and were disregarded in the
analysis. Van der Waals interactions were smoothly switched to zero between 1.0-1.2 nm with
the VERLET cut-off scheme. Electrostatic interactions were truncated at 1.2 nm (short-range)
and long-range contributions were computed within the PME approximation.[33,34]
Hydrogen bond lengths were constrained employing the LINCS algorithm.[35]
Markov State Model Analysis
We obtained a series of MD equilibrium trajectories of the MPro monomers (60μs) of SARSCoV-2 main protease under different salts/ ionic strengths, without inhibitors. These should
have explored a major part of the MPro conformational phase space. We combined the allatom MD simulations with Markov state model (MSM) theory[36–38] in order to enable the
extraction of long-time-scale individual monomer dynamics from rather short-time-scale MD
trajectories of different states. The application and accuracy of the powerful MSM theory has
been presented in many cases also by experiments that include protein−protein, or protein-

drug binding kinetics, as well as protein folding rates and protein dynamics.[39–42] Our
objective was to approximate the slow dynamics in a statistically efficient manner. Thus, a
lower dimensional representation of our simulation data was necessary. In order to reduce
the dimensionality of our feature space, we employed the time-structure independent
components analysis (tICA) which yields a representation of our molecular simulation data
with a reduced dimensionality and can greatly facilitate the decomposition of our system into
the discrete Markovian states necessary for MSM estimation. The conformations of the
system were projected on these slowest modes as defined by the tICA method, then the
trajectory frames were clustered into 100 cluster-centers (microstates) by k-means clustering,
as implemented in PyEMMA.[43] Conformational changes of a system can be simulated as a
Markov chain, if the transitions between the different conformations are sampled at long
enough time intervals so that each transition is Markovian. This means that a transition from
one conformation to another is independent of the previous transitions. Therefore, an MSM
is a memoryless model. The uncertainty bounds were computed using a Bayesian
scheme.[44,45] We found that the slowest implied timescales converge quickly and are
constant within a 95% confidence interval for lag times above 50ns. The validation procedure
is a standard approach in the MSM field., a lag time of 50 ns was selected for Bayesian model
construction, and the resulting models were validated by the Chapman-Kolmogorov (CK) test.
Subsequently, the resulting MSMs were further coarse grained into a smaller number of three
metastable states or microstates, using PCCA++ as implemented in PyEMMA.[43] The
optimum number of microstates (three) was proposed based on the VAMP2-score.[46] Both
the convergence of the implied timescales, as well as the CK test confirm the validity and
convergence of the MSM. The CK test indicates that predictions from the built MSM agree
well with MSMs estimated with longer lag times. Thus, the model can describe well the longtime-scale behavior of our system within error. The tICA method identified the torsional
angles of the following MPro residues: 3, 4, 5, 6, 84, 135, 141, 164, 167, 171, 175, 178, 179,
180, 190, 195, 217, 284, 285, 286, 290, 291, 300, and 301 as the most important features, by
setting a series of thresholds for the coefficients in the tICA vectors. At first, we set a threshold
of 0.09. We continued by setting a threshold of 0.04 for the coefficients in the tICA vectors of
the filtered data and afterwards a threshold of 0.085. Finally, we set a threshold of 0.075 and
thus we concluded in the previously referred MPro residues. For the selection of these
thresholds we checked for different thresholds the VAMP2-score and the states projected
onto the first two independent components. We report the exact functions of the first two
tICA components, as a linear combination of cosine/ sine functions of the associated
torsionals:

The residues that seem to affect the MPro-fortunellin dynamics are derived based on the
same MSM/ tICA protocol described before in the absence of the inhibitor. These include: 44,
48, 53, 82, 83, 84, 111, 112, 118, 137, 138, 139, 141, 159, 182, 238, 239, 240, 286, 287, 288,
289, 291. At first, we set a threshold of 0.075. We continued by setting a threshold of 0.12 for
the coefficients in the tICA vectors of the filtered data, a threshold of 0.18, a threshold of
0.065 and afterwards a threshold of 0.135. Finally, we set a threshold of 0.125 and thus we
concluded in the previously referred residues. However, the MPro states in the presence of
fortunellin, reported in Figure 1E of the main manuscript, are derived based on the projection
of the Mpro-fortunellin trajectory data on the aforementioned phase space of the CV1, CV2
functions.

Enhanced Molecular Dynamics Sampling
To enhance the conformational sampling on the MPro dimer we employed the parallel
tempering metadynamics in the well-tempered ensemble (PTmetaD-WTE) method.[47–50]
Nine replicas per sample were run at 310, 320, 330, 341, 352, and 363K, 375K, 387K and 400K
in which only the potential energy (PE) was initially biased (bias factor 120) to achieving large
fluctuations in PE and replica overlaps. Replicas were allowed to exchange every 1000 steps
for 0.2μs each, which gave an exchange probability around 20% in the WTE. The obtained bias
was saved and used for the subsequent PTmetaD production runs for another 0.5μs per
sample/ replica. Nine replicas were again considered at the same temperatures. Including the
equilibration time at reach replica, a cumulative simulation time of 10μs was achieved. An
exchange was attempted every 1000 steps, that gave an exchange probability between
replicas at around 20%, consistent with the large sample sizes. The Collective Variables (CVs)
chosen for the PTmetaD runs were the first two tICA vectors presented above (CV1/ CV2). A
combination of the GROMACS 2020/ PLUMED 2.5[51] engines was employed. A bias factor of
25 at the well-tempered ensemble, along with Gaussians of 1.2 kJ/mol initial height, and
sigma values (width) of 0.25 in the CV space, deposited every 2 ps, was employed. The grid
space for both CVs is defined between -4 to 4 at a resolution of 0.05. Four different PTmetaDWTE runs were performed for the pdb 6yb7/ 6lub7 -based dimers at 150mM KCl without
inhibitor.

Natural product properties: the fortunellin – analogs
Apiin (apigenin-7-apioglucoside), is a natural flavonoid, a diglycoside of the flavone apigenin, isolated
from leaves of Apium graveolens var. dulce (celery) and Petroselinum crispum (parsley). Apiin
extracted from celery exhibited anti-inflammatory properties, as apiin showed strong inhibitory
activity on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitrite (NO) production when added
before LPS stimulation of J774.A1 cells.[52] In mice models, apiin had a remarkable scavenging activity
on maleic dialdehyde (MDA) and lipofuscin (LPF), promoted total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) and
significantly enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)
and catalase (CAT),[53] by exerting a radical scavenging activity greater than that of absorbic acid[54]
and Vitamin E.[53] Apiin also showed a marked antihypertensive effect in experimental pulmonary
hypertension in dogs [55] and anti-influenza virus activity in vitro through inhibition of neuraminidase
(NA).[56] Besides, the role of apiin cardiovascular activity as antiarrhythmic and anti-ischemic agent
has also been reported.[57] In view of our results, apiin might therefore be a strong drug candidate,
as it inhibits SARS-CoV-2 virus and tackling also COVID-19 major disease symptoms.
Rhoifolin (apigenin 7-O-neohesperidoside), is a neohesperidoside, a dihydroxyflavone and a
glycosyloxyflavone, was first isolated from plant Rhus succedanea (Sumac or wax tree, originating from
Asia, but also found in Australia and New Zealand).[58] Resently, rhoifolin was found to efficiently
block the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL-Pro,[59] with a methodology similar to that used in the
present study. In addition, rhoifollin was reported to inhibit CVB3 infection, a primary cause of viral
myocarditis in humans. In addition, it was found to decrease inflammation, by significantly decreasing
prostaglandin E2 and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6).[60,61]
Rhoifolin isolated from Citrus grandis leaves was beneficial in metabolic diseases, including type II
diabetes, by enhancing adiponectin secretion, tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor-β and
GLUT4 translocation.[62] Rhoifolin also caused a decrease of mean aortic pressure, of the arterial and
pulmonary capillary pressure and of heart rate in the dog.[63] Moreover, previous study has

demonstrated that rhoifolin can have an inhibitory effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
activity, which plays a key role in the regulation of arterial blood pressure.[63]
