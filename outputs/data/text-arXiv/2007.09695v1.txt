Introduction
In late 2019, a sudden new coronavirus (hereafter referred to as COVID-19) swept through

Wuhan. Soon the epidemic spread rapidly throughout China. Until June 29, 2020, there were 10
million cases and nearly 500,000 deaths[1] of COVID-19 have now been reported globally. The
COVID-19 epidemic has become a major safety and health threat worldwide. One of the key steps
to curb the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic is effective screening of suspected infected persons
to prevent the virus from spreading further among the population. The most accurate screening
method for new coronary pneumonia is nucleic acid detection, that is, reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection is taken from nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and
other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, and stool samples[2]. Although RT-PCR testing is the
gold standard for COVID-19 screening, RT-PCR testing is a very complicated, time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. Not all health institutions in all regions have such testing conditions. At the
beginning of the outbreak, the number of RT-PCR detection reagents is very limited. In the
background of the global epidemic, some countries and regions still do not have a sufficient number
of RT-PCR testing kits.
After the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, the National Health Comission of the People's

Republic of China in the "New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program
(Trial Fifth Edition)"[3] for the first time included suspected cases with chest imaging features into
clinical diagnosis cases, that is The suspected cases of new coronary pneumonia can be diagnosed
based on imaging features. The first and main imaging test for the diagnosis of new coronary
pneumonia is High Resolution Computerized Tomography(HRCT) of the chest. Considering that
the testing capacity and human resources of health care institutions in some regions are limited, and
the cost of HRCT testing is relatively high, the radiation is relatively large, especially for patients
who are suspected of being infected with new coronary pneumonia but are ultimately
undiagnosed(maybe other infection like bacterial pneumonia or other virus infection). This is
undoubtedly a great price for patients. Therefore, for these areas where medical resources are
insufficient or the medical resources have been saturated during the epidemic, it is of great
significance to use Chest X-ray (CXR) for the initial screening of the COVID-19. This project
designs and implements a deep convolutional neural network to classify CXR images, which can be
used as an auxiliary method to help artificial X-ray imaging rapid screening of the COVID-19.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the COVID-19 imaging features and the
related work of deep learning in COVID-19 imaging diagnosis; Section 3 introduces the dataset
source of this project and the main research and optimization methods, then proposes a deep
convolutional neural network model; Section 4 introduces the experimental environment that the
project depends on and the evaluation index results of the model on the training set and testing set;
Section 4 summarizes the project and its shortcomings, and expounds the outlook for future work;
Finally section are the references of this paper.

Research on COVID-19 imaging diagnosis

2.1 COVID-19 imaging features
According to the description of the imaging diagnosis in the "New Coronavirus Infected
Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program (Trial Seventh Edition)"[2], the chest imaging of
patients infected COVID-19 “In the early stage, there are multiple small patch shadows and
interstitial changes, with obvious extrapulmonary zone. Then it develops multiple ground glass
shadows and infiltration shadows of the lungs. In severe cases, lung consolidation may occur, and
pleural effusions are rare.” According to the analysis of the recently published literature by Deng et
al[4], milled glass shadow and solid change shadow are the most common imaging signs, and lesion
It is mainly located peripherally and subpleurally, along the bronchovascular bundle, and is diffusely
distributed in both lungs as the disease progresses. A Normal chest X-ray image has been shown in
Figure 1, and a chest X-ray image of a COVID-19 patient has been shown in Figure 2, some COVID19 imaging features can be observed in comparison with Figure 1 and Figure 2 .

2.2 Related work of deep learning in COVID-19 imaging diagnosis
In recent years, artificial intelligence, especially deep learning technology, with its powerful data
analysis and feature recognition capabilities, has become prominent and clinically recognized in the
diagnosis and recognition of lung diseases such as chest X-ray quality control, lung nodule
segmentation and detection, and lung cancer screening[5]. The study shows that AI has a sensitivity
of 71%, specificity of 95%[6] and far better recognition speed than humans in distinguishing normal
from abnormal chest radiographs on CXR image classification.
In the middle of the epidemic in China , Alibaba DAMO Academy cooperated with Alibaba
Cloud and then developed a set of new AI diagnostic technology for clinical diagnosis of COVID19, which can accurately interpret CT images of suspected cases of COVID-19 within 20 seconds
and the accuracy of analysis results reached 96%[7], and the system first landed in Xiaotangshan
Hospital Zhengzhou, China on February 16 for auxiliary clinical diagnosis. The effectiveness and
usefulness of AI in medical imaging is evident, providing strong technical support to contain the

spread of the epidemic.
The current imaging diagnosis of COVID-19 is mostly based on CT images, due to the high rate
of misses on chest X-rays for early lesions or predominantly milled glass density changes. The
advantages of CT especially HRCT, are its high spatial resolution, freedom from interference from
structures beyond the level, and multi-planar, multi-directional display of lesion detail through postprocessing techniques. Xu et al[8]. proposed a 3D deep learning model to segment candidate
infection domains from the lung CT image set and further calculate confidence scores using a
regional attention mechanism model, capable of accurately screening COVID-19 by lung CT images.
The Section 1 in this paper mentions the continued importance of x-ray images for screening for
COVID-19, El-Din Hemdan et al[9]. proposed a deep learning classifier framework called COVIDXNET for diagnosing COVID-19 in CXR, the paper also validated seven different DCNN models
such as VGG19 and Densenet201 and found that VGG19 and DenseNet classification performed
better. Wang Linda and Wong Alexander[10] presented a deep convolutional neural network named
COVID-Net to detect COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images and analyzed how COVID-Net
makes predictions using interpretable methods, in order to gain insight into the key factors
associated with COVID-19 cases that can help clinicians perform better screening.

Methods

3.1 COVID-19 CXR Dataset
As of today, the number of publicly available COVID-19 image datasets remains small. Some
middle COVID-19 dataset like Joseph Paul Cohen et al[11]. provide in their paper. This paper
proposes an open source COVID-19 dataset named COVID-19 CXR Dataset, which can be obtained
from this Github link(https://github.com/ZY-ZRY/COVID19-CXR). COVID-19-CXR-Dataset has
a total of 6,354 CXR images, including test set and training set, divided into three categories:
COVID-19, Normal and Pneumonia. Category COVID-19 are CXR images of patients infected
COVID-19; Category Normal are normal CXR images; Category Pneumonia are CXR images of
patients infected other kinds of pneumonia. The distrubution of the category in the COVID-19 CXR
Dataset is shown in Table 1.
The CXR images in COVID-19-CXR-Dataset are obtained from these open source and public
datasets:

COVID-19 CXR Dataset catagory distribution

3.2 Data pre-processing, data augmentation and category balance
During to the CXR images in COVID-19 CXR Dataset are obtained from a few of public and
open source datasets, the image format, image size, and location of the chest range image capture
(anterior/posterior/sideways) in the dataset are inconsistent, some images even have distinct lesion
labeling information, which interfered significantly with image recognition. So before training, I
have pre-processed the image data firstly, remove the CT images in the dataset and the CXR images
with lesions. In addition, the number of CXR images taken on the side is small, and they are also
removed. Then I convert the CXR images into jpeg/jpg format. Finally the images are uniformly
resized as 80×80 before they are imported into the model.
There are only 6,354 CXR images in COVID-19 CXR Dataset, the data is not rich enough.
From the chart statistics in Table 1, we can see that there are obvious data imbalances in the three
categroies of CXR images in the training set. In view of the lack of data, some data enhancement
methods were used in the project, for example, random horizontal flip (vertical flip is meaningless
for medical images), random brightness adjustment, random contrast adjustment, random saturation
adjustment and random cropping, etc. These methods could enrich the dataset, reduce the situation
of overfitting the model, and enhance the robustness of the model. In view of the imbalance of data
categories, the gradient descent of the loss function of the project during training introduces class
weights, which makes the categories with less data have greater losses in training. So the model
would pay more attention to the categories with less data.

3.3 Deep convolutional neural network model in this paper
Deep convolutional neural network is an intuitive and powerful network architecture in deep
learning, and is widely used in pattern recognition and image classification tasks. In recent years,
with the further development of deep learning technology, more and more efficient DCNN models
have been proposed one after another, like VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet etc. These
DCNNs perform well in image classification tasks, making it possible for computers to perform
better than humans in visual classification.
VGG[15] networks only use small convolution kernels and increase the number of network layers
to improve the accuracy in the classification tasks. There is no doubt that increasing the depth of the
network allows the model to better fit complex data with higher dimensions, and the use of small
convolution kernels can greatly reduce the number of parameters. Shallow networks usually have
rich semantic information, but VGG does not make the most of this semantic information.
This paper proposes a deep convloutional neural network model based on the VGG16. Limited
by my poor device(only have 2GB graphic card memory), I have reduced the number of layers and
filters to make sure my graphic card memory won’t explode(After that I seem to find that increasing
the number of network layers and filters does not significantly improve the metrics). In order to
make full use of the semantic information of the network, I also made some other changes, like add
GlobalAveragePooling layer after Maxpooling and concatenate these independent neurons.
The model This model mainly consists of four sets of convolution-pooling networks, a
concatenate layer and two flatten layers. The model has 63,148,835 parameters, and its complete
structure is shown in Figure 3.

3.4 Loss function and metrics
During the training, I used CategoricalCrossentropy as my loss function, For every input sample
𝑖𝑖 and its category label 𝑗𝑗, has

𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 = − � 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 log (𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 )
𝑗𝑗

where 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is the label for sample 𝑖𝑖 , indicating that the category of sample 𝑖𝑖 is 𝑗𝑗；𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is the

probability that sample 𝑖𝑖 is predicted to be category 𝑗𝑗.

In particular, for one-hot encoding labels in single-label classification problems, the label 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗

for each sample 𝑖𝑖 has only one element of one and the rest are zeros, then the loss function becomes
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 = −log (𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 )

so the overall loss function is

𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 = −

1
� log (𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 )
𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖

where 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is the probability that sample 𝑖𝑖 is predicted to be sample 𝑖𝑖's actual category 𝑗𝑗.

To better evaluate the validity of the model, this project uses a diversity of evaluation metrics.

First of all, the concept of a confusion matrix is first introduced here, and the composition of the
confusion matrix is shown in Table 2.
Confuse Matrix
Actually Positive
Actually Negative

Predict Positive

Predict Negative

True Positive (TP)
False Positive (FP)

False Negative (FN)
True Negative (TN)

Table 2

Confuse Matrix

The confusion matrix consists of the following four indicators:


True Postive (TP): the number of correctly classified samples as positive category



False Negative (FN): the number of wrongly classified samples as negative category but
actually belong to postive categroy



False Positive (FP): the number of wrongly classified samples as positive categroy but actually
belong to negative category



True Negative (TN): the number of correctly classified samples as negative category
With the four indicators of the confusion matrix, three evaluation indicators Accuracy, Precision,

and Recall (also called Sensitivity) can be defined:
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 =

𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃 + 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 + 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 + 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 + 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 =
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 =

𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 + 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹

𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 + 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹

3.5 Optimizer and optimization tricks
During the training I used Adam, Nadam and SGD optimizers, but finally I prefered to use Adam
and it helped obtained a not bad result(see Table 3).
For CXR images and COVID-19 CXR Dataset, in addition to the data preprocessing and data
augmentation methods mentioned in Section 3.2, other optimization methods such as Warmup and
label smoothing are also used.
Warmup is a learning rate warm-up method mentioned by He Kaiming et al[16]. Since the weights
of the model in the initial epochs of training are randomly initialized, if using a large learning rate,
the model may be unstable. Therefore, I used the Warmup method, using a small learning rate in the
first few epochs or steps of the training, and then using the preset learning rate for training after the
model is relatively stable, which makes the model convergence speed faster and more effective.
In the later stage of training, the loss of the model is reduced to a low level. At this time, if the
original larger learning rate is still used, it may cause "oscillation". In order to reduce the model
gradient to the local minimum as soon as possible, the learning rate should be gradually
attenuated(Decay).
In combination with Warmup and Decay, I used a three-stage learning rate when training the
model, that is, a smaller learning rate is used in the initial stage, and a larger preset learning rate is
used in the intermediate stage after the model is stabilized, and at the later stage of training, in order
to help the model further converge, a smaller learning rate is used.
In view of the obvious overfitting of the model during the training process, I also used label
smoothing during training. Label smoothing was first proposed by Szegedz et al[17]. It is a
regularization strategy. In Section 3.4 this paper ever introduced the cross entropy loss function for
every sample 𝑖𝑖 with one-hot encoding label:

𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 = − log�𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 �

①

after using label smoothing, the one-hot encoding label will add an error term 𝜀𝜀, so the label change

to

1 − 𝜀𝜀
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = � 𝜀𝜀
𝑁𝑁 − 1

the loss function for every sample 𝑖𝑖 change to

𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 == 𝑦𝑦
𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ! = 𝑦𝑦

𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 = − log�(1 − 𝜀𝜀) 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 � − � log �
𝑘𝑘≠𝑗𝑗

②

𝜀𝜀
𝑝𝑝 �
𝑁𝑁 − 1 𝑖𝑖,𝑘𝑘

③

where 𝑁𝑁 is the total number of classification categories, 𝜀𝜀 is a small value hyperparameter, and
𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is the probability that the sample 𝑖𝑖 is predicted to be category 𝑗𝑗.

Comparing ① and ③, it can be found that after using label smoothing, the loss of a single

sample 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 increases, so the global Loss will also increase accordingly, That is, a little penalty

is imposed on the model classification, so the model is more robust. If the model want to achieve

the loss level as before using label smooth, it must be closer to the global optimal/local optimal.

It can be seen from Table 3 that the test set has an accuracy rate of 87.3%, an accuracy rate of

correctly classified, and the recall rate and accuracy rate reached 97%. As far as evaluation metrics
are concerned, the model still has space for improvement.
To show whether the model is valid or not, I write the mean and the confidence interval under
95% confidence of the predicted probability of the three types of samples in the test set in Table 4.

Category prediction probability of Test Set under 95% confidence interval

It can be seen from Table 4 that under the condition of 95% confidence interval, the model has
a prediction probability of more than 81% for COVID-19 samples. Based on this, it can be

considered that the model is effective in identifying COVID-19, and the model has a high degree of
confidence in the classification of COVID-19.
Comparing to COVID-19 samples, the model has lower confidence in classfication of the
Normal and Pneumonia samples. Table 5 is the confusion matrix of the test set and Figure 4 is the
visualization of the confusion matrix, which can partially explain the reason for this situation.

Visualization of The Confusion Matrix in Table 5

From Table 5 and Figure 4, it can be seen that the model has a lot of confusion for the Normal
samples and Pneumonia samples, the percentage of misjudgments with each other exceeded 11%.
One of the possible reasons is that the class weight setting is too biased towards COVID-19. Using
more reasonable class weights may further improve the performance of the model.
In addition, model has far less missed detection samples than the number of false positives
samples on the COVID-19 category. Considering in real life, the cost of a false positive for COVID19 is much less than the cost of a missed detection, therefore the model works well in COVID-19

classification.

4.3 Qualitative Analysis

Observing the curve, it can be seen that as the training progresses, the loss function gradually
converges, and the accuracy of the model shows an upward trend. However, the accuracy of the
model on the training set and the test set has a certain distance, which shows that the model still has
overfitting. So the model has a lot of space for improvement.

Conclusion
The COVID-19 epidemic situation has not been completely contained, and the adverse effects

on people's lives and transportation are still continuing. During the research process, I was restricted
by the research conditions, so I can only use a small image size as 80×80 to training the model,
and the model has a lot of space for improvement. This paper proposed a open source COVID-19
dataset named COVID-19 CXR Dataset, and proposed a DCNN model achieved 87.3% accuracy,
89.67 % precision, and 84.46% recall, and correctly classifies 98 out of 100 COVID-19 x-ray images
in the test set. This paper can be used by other researchers to conduct more in-depth research based
on this paper. I hope to work with other researchers to make small contributions to contain the
epidemic and industry development. Finally, I hope the epidemic will end soon and return to normal
life!
