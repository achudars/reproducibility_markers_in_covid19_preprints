To increase situational awareness and support evidence-based policy-making, we
formulated two types of mathematical models for COVID-19 transmission within a
regional population. One is a fitting function that can be calibrated to reproduce an
epidemic curve with two timescales (e.g., fast growth and slow decay). The other is a
compartmental model that accounts for quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, a nonexponentially distributed incubation period, asymptomatic individuals, and mild and
severe forms of symptomatic disease. Using Bayesian inference, we have been calibrating
our models daily for consistency with new reports of confirmed cases from the 15 most
populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States and quantifying uncertainty in
parameter estimates and predictions of future case reports. This online learning approach
allows for early identification of new trends despite considerable variability in case
reporting. We infer new significant upward trends for five of the metropolitan areas starting
between 19-April-2020 and 12-June-2020.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1), was detected in the United States (US) in January
2020 (2). In February, COVID-19-caused deaths were detected (3). Thereafter, surveillance
testing expanded nationwide (4). These and other efforts revealed community spread across the
US and exponential growth of new COVID-19 cases throughout most of March with a doubling
time of 2 to 3 d (5), similar to that of the initial outbreak in China (6). This situation led to
government mandates closing schools, prohibiting public gatherings, and restricting commercial
activities, as well as broad adoption of social-distancing practices, such as working-from-home,
curtailing of travel, and face mask-wearing (7). Although the US became a hot spot of the
COVID-19 pandemic, detection of new cases peaked in late-April and steadily declined until
mid-June (4), suggesting that public-health mandates and social-distancing practices were
effective at slowing COVID-19 transmission. Attempts to quantify the impacts of these measures
suggest substantial benefits in terms of reduction of disease burden (8, 9).
At present, the number of new daily cases in the US is again increasing (4). It is imperative
that we effectively monitor ongoing COVID-19 transmission, so that dangerous upticks in cases
can be responded to as quickly as possible.
To contribute to situational awareness of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, we developed
two distinct mathematical models for the regional COVID-19 epidemic in each of the 15 most
populous US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) (10). The two models are 1) a fitting function,
which can reproduce the shape of an epidemic curve having two timescales (e.g., fast growth and
slow decay), and 2) a compartmental model. The latter model is composed of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) characterizing the population dynamics of susceptible,
presymptomatic, symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered populations and various
subpopulations, including mixing and protected-by-social-distancing populations, individuals
who are quarantined or self-isolated, individuals incubating virus without symptoms at multiple
stages of disease progression, and individuals with mild and severe forms of disease. The model
also tracks hospitalizations and deaths.
In an ongoing online-learning effort, we are calibrating our models for regional COVID-19
epidemics on a daily basis for consistency with historical case reports. We have also been
applying Bayesian methods to quantify uncertainties in predicted detection of new cases. In the
face of variability in case detection, this approach allows for early objective identification of new
epidemic trends beyond what can be reasonably explained by a well-calibrated model that is
consistent with historical case reporting, enabling an evidence-based response by policy makers.
Methods
Data Used in Online Learning
The COVID-19 surveillance data used to parameterize models—reports of new confirmed
cases, the earliest widely available indicators of local trends—are obtained daily (at variable

times of day) from the GitHub repository maintained by The New York Times newspaper (11).
This repository aggregates reports from US State and local health agencies. We aggregate
county-level case counts to obtain case counts for each of the 15 most populous US MSAs.
These MSAs encompass the following cities: New York City; Los Angeles; Chicago; Dallas;
Houston; Washington, DC; Miami; Philadelphia; Atlanta; Phoenix; Boston; San Francisco;
Riverside, CA; Detroit; and Seattle. We will use these city names to refer to the MSAs. The
political entities comprising each MSA, which are almost always counties1, are those delineated
by the federal government (10).
Models for COVID-19 Transmission and Model Parameters
In ongoing work, each day, for the regional COVID-19 epidemic in each of the 15 MSAs of
interest, we parameterize a curve-fitting model—a fitting function—and a compartmental model
for consistency with all daily reports of new confirmed cases that are available at the time.
The form of the curve-fitting model is defined by Equations (2)–(4) in the Appendix. This
form was chosen because of its ability to generate asymmetrically shaped curves (Figure 1). The
curve-fitting model is taken to have four adjustable parameters (Table 1): 𝑁, the total number of
infected individuals who will be detected over the entire course of the local epidemic; 𝑡! , the
start time of the local epidemic; and 𝑘 and 𝜃, the shape and scale parameters of a gamma (Γ)
distribution. Inference of adjustable parameter values is based on a negative binomial likelihood
function, given by Equation (31) in the Appendix. The dispersal parameter 𝑟 of the likelihood is
taken to be adjustable; its value is jointly inferred with those of 𝑁, 𝑡! , 𝑘, and 𝜃. The inferred
parameter values are inference-time-dependent and region-specific. Inferences are conditioned
on the model and fixed parameter estimates for 𝜇 and 𝜎 (Table 1), which characterize the waiting
time from infection to onset of symptoms (12), which is taken to be a log-normally distributed
random variable.
The compartmental model was formulated to capture populations and processes important in
COVID-19 transmission (Figure 2). Appendix Figure 1 provides a more detailed illustration of
the model. In the model, the susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and removed (R)
populations of the classic SEIR model are all considered but are divided into subpopulations. An
important feature of the model, introduced to capture the effects of social distancing, is that
susceptible and infectious individuals are divided into mixing and protected subpopulations. In
the mixing population, individuals interact with others as they would normally (i.e., without
taking special precautions to prevent COVID-19 transmission), whereas in the protected
population, individuals practice social distancing, which is taken to slow COVID-19
transmission. The model consists of 25 ordinary differential equations (ODEs), defined by
Equations (5)–(26) in the Appendix. Each state variable of the model represents the size of a
population (or in other terminology, the population of a compartment). In addition to the 25
ODEs, we consider an auxiliary 1-parameter measurement model, which relates state variables to
expected case reporting (see Equations (27) and (28) in the Appendix). The model is formulated

so as to allow consideration of multiple periods of social distancing with distinct setpoints for the
protected population size. In the model, there is always an initial period of social distancing. The
number of additional social-distancing periods is indicated by 𝑛. Here, we only consider two
cases: 𝑛 = 0 and 𝑛 = 1.
For 𝑛 = 0 (i.e., only one social-distancing period), the compartmental model and auxiliary
measurement model have a total of 20 parameters. We take six of these parameters to have
adjustable values (Table 2) and 14 to have fixed values (Table 3). In the Appendix, we describe
each parameter and explain the fixed parameter settings, which are based on information in Refs.
(12)–(20) and assumptions. The adjustable model parameters are as follows: 𝑡! , the start time of
the local epidemic; 𝜎 > 𝑡! , the time at which social distancing begins; 𝑝! , which establishes a
setpoint for the quasi-stationary fraction of the total population practicing social distancing; 𝜆! ,
which establishes a timescale for adoption of social-distancing practices; and 𝛽, which
characterizes the rate of disease transmission in the absence of social distancing. The
measurement-model parameter, 𝑓" , represents the time-averaged fraction of new cases detected,
which is related to the intensity of local surveillance efforts. As for the curve-fitting model,
inference of adjustable parameter values is based on a negative binomial likelihood function
(Equation (31) in the Appendix). The dispersal parameter 𝑟 of the likelihood is taken to be
adjustable; its value is jointly inferred with those of 𝑡! , 𝜎, 𝑝! , 𝜆! , 𝛽, and 𝑓" . All inferred
parameter values are inference-time-dependent and region-specific. Inferences are conditioned
on the model and fixed parameter estimates.
For 𝑛 > 0 (i.e., 𝑛 distinct social-distancing periods following an initial or first-phase socialdistancing period), the compartmental model has three additional adjustable parameters for each
additional period of social distancing considered beyond the initial period. For one additional
period of social distancing (𝑛 = 1), the additional adjustable parameters are as follows: 𝜏# > 𝜎,
the onset time of second-phase social-distancing; 𝑝# , the second-phase quasi-stationary setpoint
parameter; and 𝜆# , which determines the timescale for transition from first- to second-phase
social-distancing behavior. If adherence to effective social-distancing practices begins to relax at
time 𝑡 = 𝜏# , then 𝑝# < 𝑝! .
Statistical Model for Noisy Case Reporting
The curve-fitting and compartmental models are both deterministic, despite COVID-19
transmission being a stochastic process. We interpret each model to predict the expected number
of new confirmed COVID-19 cases reported daily by the relevant public health authorities. In
other words, we assume that the number of new cases reported over a 1-d period is a random
variable and its expected value follows a deterministic trajectory. We further assume that day-today fluctuations in the random variable are independent and characterized by a negative binomial
distribution, which we will denote as NB(𝑟, 𝑝). We use NB(𝑟, 𝑝) to statistically model noise in
reporting (and case detection, which influences reporting) because its support—the non-negative
integers—is natural for populations and, in addition, its shape is flexible enough to recapitulate a

wide range of unimodal empirical distributions. With these assumptions, we obtain a likelihood
function (Equation (31) in the Appendix) taking the form of a product of probability mass
functions of NB(𝑟, 𝑝). Formulation of a likelihood is a prerequisite for standard Bayesian
inference2.
Online Learning of Model Parameter Values through Bayesian Inference
We use Bayesian inference to learn adjustable model parameter values consistent with the
time-series of daily MSA-specific reports of new COVID-19 cases available up to the point of
inference. Inferences with both models are performed daily for each MSA of interest. In each
inference, we assume a uniform prior and use an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithm (21) to generate samples of the posterior distribution for the adjustable parameters. A
full description of our inference procedure is provided in the Appendix.
The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of a parameter value is the value of the parameter
corresponding to the mode of its marginal posterior, where probability mass is highest.
Forecasting with Quantification of Prediction Uncertainty: Bayesian Predictive Inference
In addition to inferring parameter values, we quantify uncertainty in predicted trajectories of
daily case reports. A predictive inference of the expected number of new cases detected on a
given day is derived from a model by parameterizing it using a randomly chosen parameter
posterior sample generated in MCMC sampling. The number of these cases that are detected is
then predicted by adding a noise term, drawn from a negative binomial distribution NB(𝑟, 𝑝),
where 𝑟 is set at the randomly sampled value—recall that the value of 𝑟 is jointly inferred with
adjustable model parameter values—and 𝑝 is set such that the mean of NB(𝑟, 𝑝) corresponds to
the predicted number of new active cases, i.e., the value of 𝑝 is set using Equation (30) in the
Appendix. A full description of our predictive inference procedure is provided in the Appendix.
Predictions of the curve-fitting model are obtained by evaluating the sum in Equation (2) in
the Appendix. Predictions of the compartmental model are obtained by using LSODA (22) to
numerically integrate Equations (5)–(21) and (27) in the Appendix; the initial condition is
defined by the inferred value of 𝑡! (Table 2) and the fixed settings for 𝑆! and 𝐼! (Table 3).
The 95% credible interval for the predicted number of new case reports on a given day is the
central part of the marginal predictive posterior capturing 95% of the probability mass. This
region is bounded above by the 97.5 percentile and below by the 2.5 percentile
Results
The objective of our ongoing study is to detect significant new trends in new COVID-19
cases as early as possible by 1) systematically and regularly updating mathematical models
capturing historical trends in regional COVID-19 epidemics through Bayesian inference and 2)
making forecasts with rigorously quantified uncertainties through Bayesian predictive inference.

An important aspect of how we are analyzing COVID-19 data is our focus on the populations
of US cities and their surrounding areas (i.e., MSAs) vs. the regional populations within other
political boundaries, such as those of the US States. The boundaries of MSAs are defined on the
basis of social and economic interactions (10), which suggests that the population of an MSA is
likely to be more uniformly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than, for example, the
population of a State. In accordance with this expectation, daily reports of new COVID-19 cases
for New York City (Figure 3, panel A) are more temporally correlated than for the US State of
New York (Figure 3, panel B), New Jersey (Figure 3, panel C), or Pennsylvania (Figure 3, panel
D). New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are the three States encompassing the New York
City MSA.
For each of the 15 most populous MSAs in the US, we parameterized a curve-fitting model
and a compartmental model using MSA-specific surveillance data, namely, aggregated Countylevel reports indicating the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases within a given MSA each
day. Bayesian parameterization and forecasting with uncertainty quantification (UQ)—predictive
inference—are now being performed daily for each of the 15 MSAs, with both models.
Results of Bayesian predictive inference are exemplified in Figure 4. Predictions are obtained
in the form of a predictive posterior distribution and are based on all case reports available at the
time of inference. In Figure 4, the entire shaded region indicates the 95% credible interval of the
predictive posterior as a function of time. In other words, this band indicates where 95% of
predictions of daily case reports fall at the times indicated. Predictions vary because of the
uncertainties in adjustable model parameter estimates, which are characterized quantitatively
through Bayesian inference. The colors within the shaded band indicate other credible intervals
(10%, 20%, etc.) and also the median of all predictions as a function of time.
Predictive inferences for all 15 MSAs of interest are shown in Figures 5 and 6. The
predictions of Figure 5 are conditioned on the curve-fitting model, and the predictions of Figure
6 are conditioned on the compartmental model. These results demonstrate that the curve-fitting
and compartmental models are each capable of reproducing empirical epidemic curves for
multiple MSAs, which vary in shape. However, the curve-fitting model is less flexible, as can be
seen by comparing its predictions to those of the compartmental model for the Atlanta MSA,
where there is high variability in the daily number of new cases detected. Although there is no
clear downward trend in the data, the curve-fitting model nevertheless predicts a peak in lateApril/early-May and a downward trend ever since. This prediction is obtained because the
model, by design, is only capable of generating single-peaked epidemic curves that rise and then
fall. Hereafter, we will focus on the compartmental model.
Recall that predictive inferences are made daily. In Figure 7, we show predictive inferences
for New York City and Phoenix made over a series of progressively later dates. These results
illustrate that accurate short-term predictions are possible but continual updating of parameter

estimates is required to maintain accuracy. In Videos 1 and 2, daily predictions for New York
City and Phoenix, respectively, are shown as animations.
In practice, we find that the adjustable parameters of the compartmental model have
identifiable values3, meaning that their marginal posteriors are unimodal. This finding is
illustrated in Figure 8, which displays a 7 × 7 matrix of 1- and 2-dimensional projections of the
7-dimensional MCMC posterior samples underlying predictive inferences for New York City.
Plots of marginal posteriors are shown on the diagonal extending from top left to bottom right.
The other 2-dimensional plots reveal correlations between pairs of parameter estimates (if any).
The significance of identifiability is that, despite uncertainties in parameter estimates, we can
expect predictive inferences of daily new-case reports to cluster around a central trajectory.
How does learning the region-specific adjustable parameter values of the compartmental
model and a subsequent predictive inference (i.e., a forecast with UQ) improve situational
awareness? In the vast majority of cases, when we forecast with UQ, the empirical new-case
count for the day immediately following our inference (+1), and very often for each of several
additional days, falls within the 95% credible interval of the predictive posterior. When the
reported number of new cases falls outside the 95% credible interval and above the 97.5%
percentile, we interpret this event, which we will call an upward-trending rare event, to have a
probability of 0.0275 or less assuming the model is both explanatory (i.e., satisfactorily
consistent with historical data) and predictive of the near future. If the model is predictive of the
near future, the probability of two consecutive rare events is far smaller, less than 0.001. Thus,
consecutive upward-trending rare events, which we will refer to as an upward-trending anomaly,
can be reasonably taken as a sign that the model is not in fact predictive. Indeed, an anomaly
suggests that the rate of COVID-19 transmission has increased beyond what can be explained by
the model.
For New York City, anomalies are not seen, as illustrated in Figure 9, panel A. However, for
Phoenix, there are several recent anomalies, which preceded rapid and sustained growth in the
number of new cases reported per day in June (Figure 9, panel B).
In an attempt to explain the anomalies, we allowed the compartmental model to account for a
distinct second social-distancing period, i.e., we increased the setting for 𝑛 from 0 to 1. With this
change, the number of adjustable parameters increases from 7 to 10, because in the model, each
distinct social-distancing period is characterized by 3 parameters, which must be inferred. Recall
that these parameters are an onset time, rate parameter, and setpoint parameter. The value of the
setpoint parameter determines the quasi-stationary fraction of the total regional population that is
adhering to effective social-distancing practices. In the model, 𝑝! is the setpoint parameter of the
initial social-distancing period starting at time 𝑡 = 𝜎 > 𝑡! , and 𝑝# is the setpoint parameter of a
distinct subsequent social-distancing period starting at time 𝑡 = 𝜏# > 𝜎. As can be seen by
comparing the plots in Figure 10, panels A and B, the compartmental model with two socialdistancing periods (Figure 10, panel B) better explains the Phoenix surveillance data available

than the compartmental model with just one social-distancing period (Figure 10, panel A)4.
Furthermore, the MAP estimate for 𝑝# (~0.38) is less than that for 𝑝! (~0.49) (cf. panels C and
D, Figure 10), and the marginal posteriors for these parameters are largely non-overlapping
(Figure 10, panel D). These findings suggest that the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in
Phoenix can be explained by relaxation in social distancing, which is quantified by our estimates
for 𝑝! and 𝑝# . The MAP estimate of the start time of the second period of social distancing
corresponds to 24-May-20205. Intriguingly, 8 of the 9 anomalies noted in Figure 10, panel B
occurred after this period, with the first of these occurring on 02-June-2020.
We considered the hypothesis that a one-time event (viz., a mass gathering) generating
1000’s of new infections might trigger a new upward trend in COVID-19 transmission.
Simulations for New York City and Phoenix do not support this hypothesis (Appendix Figure 2).
Besides Phoenix, four other MSAs have recent trends explainable by relaxation of social
distancing (Appendix Figure 3 and Appendix Table 1). Upward-trending anomalies were
detected for these MSAs (Appendix Figure 4, panels A–D), but not for three of four other MSAs
having epidemic curves consistent with sustained social distancing (Appendix Figure 4, panels
E–H). Daily predictions for the MSAs considered in Appendix Figure 4 are shown in Videos 3–
10.
Discussion
Daily online learning of model parameter values from real-time surveillance data is feasible
for mathematical models for COVID-19 transmission. Furthermore, predictive inference of the
daily number of new cases reported is feasible for the regional COVID-19 epidemics occurring
in multiple US metropolitan areas. Our model-based analyses are ongoing and daily forecasts are
being disseminated (23).
We have suggested how our predictive inferences can be used to identify harbingers of future
growth in COVID-19 transmission rate. Two consecutive upward-trending rare events (i.e.,
instances where the number of new cases reported is above the upper limit of the 95% credible
interval of the predictive posterior) seem to indicate potential for increased transmission in the
future. This signal of future growth is perhaps especially strong when anomalies are
accompanied by increasing prediction uncertainty, as is the case for Phoenix (Figure 9, panel B).
We find that the recent increase in rate of transmission of COVID-19 in the Phoenix
metropolitan area can be explained by a reduction in the percentage of the population adhering to
effective social-distancing practices6 (Figure 10, panel D), from ~49% to ~38%. Relaxation is
inferred to have begun around 24-May-2020 (Figure 10, panel B). Recent upward trends in the
rate of COVID-19 transmission in the Houston, Miami, San Francisco, and Seattle metropolitan
areas can also be explained by relaxation of social distancing (Appendix Figure 3 and Appendix
Table 1). These findings are qualitatively consistent with earlier studies indicating that social
distancing is effective at slowing the transmission of COVID-19 (7, 8), and encouragingly, they

suggest that the future course of the pandemic is controllable, especially with accurate
recognition of when stronger nonpharmaceutical interventions are needed to slow COVID-19
transmission.

For the metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) of interest, the number of political units (viz.,
counties and independent cities) comprising an MSA ranges from 2 (for the Los Angeles and
Riverside MSAs) to 29 (for the Atlanta MSA); the median (mean) number of Counties is 7 (10).
The number of States encompassing an MSA ranges from 1 (for eight of the 15 MSAs) to 4 (for
Philadelphia); the median (mean) number of encompassing States is 1 (2).

It should be noted that some related methods, typified by approximate Bayesian computation
(ABC), do not rely on a likelihood.

We do not have a mathematical proof of identifiability.

This conclusion is supported by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) values we calculated for the two scenarios (Appendix Table 1).
Although AIC and BIC are crude model-selection tools, because the posteriors here are nonnormal, we deem them to be adequately discriminatory. Each strongly indicates that the model
with two social-distancing periods is more explanatory of the data than the model with just one
social-distancing period.

The 95% credible interval places the start date within the period beginning on 20-May-2020
and ending on 28-May-2020.

Unfortunately, our study sheds no light on which social-distancing practices are effective at
slowing COVID-19 transmission.

*Estimates of the adjustable parameters (𝑁, 𝑡! , 𝑘, 𝜃, and 𝑟) are region-specific and inferencetime-dependent. Inferences are performed daily. Here, we report the maximum a posteriori
(MAP) estimates inferred for New York City using all confirmed COVID-19 case-count data
available in the GitHub repository maintained by The New York Times newspaper (11) for the
period starting on 21-January-2020 and ending on 21-June-2020 (inclusive dates). Time 𝑡 = 0
corresponds to 0000 hours on 21-January-2020. **Estimates of the fixed parameters 𝜇 and 𝜎 are
those of Lauer et al. (12). These parameter estimates define a log-normal distribution that
reproduces the empirical distribution of waiting times for the onset of symptoms after infection
with SARS-CoV-2. ***The value of 𝑝 is constrained, i.e., its reporting-time-dependent value is
determined by a formula, which is given by Equation (30) in the Appendix.

*All estimates listed in this table are taken to apply to all regions of interest except for 𝑛, the
number of distinct social-distancing periods that follow an initial social-distancing period, and
𝑆! , the region-specific initial number of susceptible individuals. The value given here for 𝑆! is
the US Census Bureau-estimated total population of the New York City metropolitan statistical
area. **We assume 𝑛 = 0 unless stated otherwise.

Figure 1. Illustration of shapes that can be produced by the fitting function that we are using to
capture trends in regional COVID-19 epidemic curves. The curve-fitting model is formulated such
that it has the capacity to reproduce the shape of an epidemic curve having two timescales.

Figure 2. Illustration of the populations and processes considered in a mechanistic compartmental
model for the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. The model accounts for susceptible (S),
exposed (E), asymptomatic (A), symptomatic (I), hospitalized (H), recovered (R), and deceased
(D) populations. It also accounts for social distancing, which establishes mixing and protected
subpopulations, quarantine driven by testing and contact tracing, and self-isolation spurred by
symptom awareness. The incubation period is divided into 5 stages, which allows the model to
reproduce an empirically determined Erlang distribution of waiting times for the onset of
symptoms after infection (12). The exposed population (consisting of individuals incubating virus)
includes presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The 𝐴-populations consist of true
asymptomatic individuals in the immune clearance phase. The gray background indicates the
populations that contribute to disease transmission. An auxiliary measurement model (Equations
(27) and (28) in the Appendix) accounts for imperfect detection and reporting of new cases.

Figure 3. Temporal correlations in surveillance data. Shown here are time-series of fractional (i.e.,
normalized) case counts. We define the fractional case count for a county on a given date to be the
reported number of cases on that date divided by the total reported number of cases in the county
over the entire period of interest. The panels in this figure show fractional case counts for (A) the
23 counties comprising the New York City metropolitan statistical area (MSA), (B) the 62 counties
comprising the State of New York, (C) the 21 counties comprising the State of New Jersey, and
(D) the 67 counties comprising the State of Pennsylvania. Within each plot, a different color is
used for the data points from each distinct county. As can be seen, time-series for the counties of
the New York City MSA are more temporally correlated than for the State-level time-series. Daily
case counts for New Jersey are similar to those for New York City because the two populations
overlap considerably: ~74% of New Jersey’s population is part of the New York City MSA and
~32% of the population of the New York City MSA is part of the State of New Jersey.

Figure 4. Illustration of Bayesian predictive inference. We forecast future daily reports of new
COVID-19 cases with rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) through online Bayesian learning
of model parameters. Each day, using all daily case-reporting data available up to that point, we
perform Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the posterior distribution for a set of
adjustable parameters. Subsampling of the posterior samples then allows us to use the relevant
model to generate trajectories of the epidemic curve that account for both parametric and
observation uncertainty. The entire shaded region indicates the 95% credible interval for
predictions of daily case reports. In other words, the central 95% of all predictions lie within the
shaded region. The color-coded bands within the shaded region indicate other credible intervals,
as indicated in the legend.

*ΔAIC ≡ AIC ,-! − AIC ,-# and ΔBIC ≡ BIC ,-! − BIC ,-# , where AIC ,-! and AIC ,-# are the
Aikake information criterion (AIC) (24) values calculated for the 𝑛 = 0 and 𝑛 = 1 versions of the

(BIC) (24) values calculated for the 𝑛 = 0 and 𝑛 = 1 versions of the compartmental model. As
recommended by Burnham and Anderson (24), we interpret ΔAIC>10 to indicate “no support for
𝑛 = 0” and ΔAIC<-10 to indicate “no support for 𝑛 = 1.” There are five MSAs for which ΔAIC
and ΔBIC are both greater than 10: Houston, Miami, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Seattle. There is
one MSA for which ΔAIC and ΔBIC are both less than −10: Boston. **The first entry in each row
of this column is the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate. The next entry, a pair of numbers

within parentheses, indicates the 95% credible interval. In this analysis, we used data available
from 21-January-2020 to 26-June-2020 (inclusive dates).

Appendix Figure 1. Detailed diagram of the populations and processes considered in the
mechanistic compartmental model. In this illustration of the compartmental model, the labels
attached to arrows indicate the parameters and variables that affect the rates of the processes
represented by the arrows. There is a one-to-one correspondence between arrow labels and terms
on the right-hand sides of Equations (5)–(21). The diagram is otherwise the same as that shown in
Figure 2.

Appendix Figure 2. We evaluated the potential impact of a one-time mass gathering that causes
50,000 and 5,000 individuals to become newly infected on 30-May-2020 in (A) the New York
City metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and (B) the Phoenix MSA, respectively. As can be seen,
such an event will step the epidemic curve up without significantly changing the slope of the curve.
According to the model, the trend in the slope of the curve is determined by the sustained level of
adherence to effective social-distancing practices. We conclude that the recent trajectory of the
epidemic curve of the Phoenix MSA cannot be explained by a one-time mass gathering.

Appendix Figure 3. Predictive inferences conditioned on the compartmental model with either
(A)–(E) one or (F)–(J) two distinct social-distancing periods. We consider five metropolitan
statistical areas (MSAs), which according to Appendix Table 1, have epidemic curves better
explained by the compartmental model with two social-distancing periods than by the
compartmental model with just one. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates for 𝜏# indicate that
the second social distancing period began on 27-May-2020 for Houston, 19-April-2020 for Miami,
24-May-2020 for Phoenix, 12-June-2020 for San Francisco, and 07-June-2020 for Seattle. In this
analysis, we used the data available from 21-January-2020 to 26-June-2020 (inclusive dates).

reports for (A) Houston, (B) Miami, (C) San Francisco, (D) Seattle, (E) Los Angeles, (F) Chicago,

have epidemic curves that are better explained by the compartmental model with two socialdistancing periods vs. just one (Appendix Table 1). Upward-trending anomalies were detected for
each of these MSAs. Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, and Washington, DC have epidemic curves
better explained by the compartmental model with just one social-distancing period vs. two
(Appendix Table 1). Upward-trending anomalies were not detected for three of these MSAs. The
exception is Chicago. Two anomalies were detected for Chicago near the end of the period
considered in the analysis.

Appendix Text
Full Description of the Curve-Fitting Model
For each metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of interest, we assume that there is an infection
curve 𝑄(𝑡) describing the number of individuals who become infected at time 𝑡 with SARSCoV-2 and who will later be detected in local COVID-19 surveillance efforts. Furthermore, we
assume that this curve has a shape that can be generated/reproduced by 𝜌. (𝑘, 𝜃, 𝑡), the
probability density function (PDF) of a gamma distribution Γ(𝑘, 𝜃). In other words, we assume
that 𝑄(𝑡) = 𝑁𝜌. (𝑘, 𝜃, 𝑡), where 𝑁 is a scaling factor that we can identify as the number of
individuals who will be detected over the entire course of the local epidemic. The shape of a
gamma distribution is flexible and determined by the values of its two parameters: 𝑘, which is
called the shape parameter, and 𝜃, which is called the scale parameter. The functional form that
we assume for 𝑄(𝑡) allows the curve-fitting model to reproduce the shape of an epidemic curve
having two timescales. Many empirical COVID-19 epidemic curves appear to have two
timescales: an initial period during which new case reports increase relatively quickly from day
to day followed by a period during which new case reports decrease relatively slowly from day
to day.
We do not take the infection curve 𝑄(𝑡) to correspond directly to the number of new
COVID-19 cases reported on the date encompassing time 𝑡, because only symptomatic
individuals are likely to be detected in COVID-19 surveillance testing (to a first approximation).
This situation complicates our model as there is known to be a potentially lengthy, variable delay
in the onset of symptoms after infection (12). We assume that the waiting time 𝜏 − 𝑡 for the
onset of COVID-19 symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection at time 𝑡 is distributed according to
a log-normal distribution. Let us use 𝜌'/ (𝜏 − 𝑡; 𝜇, 𝜎) to denote the PDF of the waiting-time
distribution modeled by a log-normal distribution with parameters 𝜇 and 𝜎 set to the values
estimated by Lauer et al. (12). Let us use 𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ) to denote the predicted number of new
COVID-19 cases reported within a period beginning at time 𝑡0 ≡ 𝑡! + 𝑖 d and ending at time
𝑡01# , where 𝑡! > 0 is the start time of the local epidemic. We assume that surveillance testing for
SARS-CoV-2 infection starts prior to time 𝑡! , and we take time 𝑡 = 0 to correspond to 0000
hours on 21-January-2020, the date on which detection of the first US COVID-19 case was
widely reported (3). Under the aforementioned assumptions, 𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ) is given by a convolution
of integral functions. Namely, 𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ) is given by the following expression:
𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ) = 𝑁 W

W 𝜌'/ (𝜏 − 𝑠; 𝜇, 𝜎) 𝜌. ( 𝑠 − 𝑡! ; 𝑘, 𝜃) d𝑠 d𝜏
3!

It should be noted that 𝑠 in this expression is a dummy variable of integration.
Equation (1) can be evaluated through numerical quadrature, but this procedure is
computationally expensive. To overcome this limitation, we replace the double integral in

(1)

Equation (1) with a sum, and we calculate 𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ) using the following expression instead of
Equation (1):
0

𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ) = 𝐾! 𝑄0 + 𝐾# 𝑄04# + ⋯ + 𝐾04# 𝑄# + 𝐾0 𝑄! = [ 𝐾045 𝑄5

and
𝑄5 = 𝑁 W

3&#$

3&

In Equation (2), the 𝐾045 terms are weighting functions (i.e., kernels) that account for the
variable duration of the incubation period, and the 𝑄5 terms represent cumulative numbers of
new detectable infections occurring over discrete 1-d periods. In Equation (3), each 𝐹'/ term
denotes a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a log-normal distribution, and in Equation
(4), each 𝐹. term denotes a CDF of a gamma distribution. In other words, 𝑄5 is the cumulative
number of individuals infected in the period (𝑡5 , 𝑡51# ) who will eventually be detected, and 𝐾045
is the probability that one of these individuals becomes symptomatic and is detected in the period
(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ), where 𝑡0 ≥ 𝑡5 .
The functional form of our curve-fitting model is defined by Equations (2)–(4), which are
derived from Equation (1). As can be seen by inspecting Equation (1), the curve-fitting model
has six parameters: 𝑁, 𝑡! (which is hidden in the definition of 𝑡0 ), 𝑘, 𝜃, 𝜇, and 𝜎. As noted
earlier, estimates are available for 𝜇 and 𝜎 from Lauer et al. (12). These parameters characterize
the variable duration of the incubation period, which starts at infection and ends at the onset of
symptoms. Thus, we take 𝜇 and 𝜎 to have fixed region-independent values. We take the
remaining parameters—𝑁 (a population size/scaling factor), 𝑡! (the start time of the local
epidemic), and 𝑘 and 𝜃 (the parameters that determine the shape of the infection curve 𝑄(𝑡))—to
have adjustable region-specific values. In our daily inferences, we consider one additional
region-specific adjustable parameter, the dispersal parameter of the likelihood function (see
Equation (31) below). The value of this parameter, 𝑟, is inferred jointly with the values of 𝑁, 𝑡! ,
𝑘, and 𝜃.

where 𝛽, 𝑆! , 𝑚$ , 𝑘' , 𝑘( , 𝑗( , 𝑓& , 𝑓) , 𝑓* , 𝑐& , 𝑐+ , and 𝑐) are positive-valued time-invariant
parameters. (It should be noted that parameter names are unique but only within the namespace
of a given model.) Each ODE in Equations (5)–(21) defines the time-rate of change of a
(sub)population, i.e., the time-rate of change of a state variable. There are 25 state variables, one
for each ODE. Note that Equations (9), (10), and (12) define 4, 4, and 3 ODEs of the model,
respectively.
The initial condition is taken to be 𝑆6 (𝑡! ) = 𝑆! , 𝐼6 (𝑡! ) = 𝐼! = 1, with all other populations
(𝑆7 , 𝐸#,6 , … , 𝐸<,6 , 𝐸#,7 , … , 𝐸<,7 , 𝐸;,( , … , 𝐸<,( , 𝐴6 , 𝐴7 , 𝐴( , 𝐼7 , 𝐼( , 𝐻, 𝐷, and 𝑅) equal to 0. The
parameter 𝑆! denotes the total region-specific population size. Thus, we assume that the entire
population is susceptible at the start of the epidemic at time 𝑡 = 𝑡! >0, where time 𝑡 = 0 is 0000
hours on 21-January-2020. The parameter 𝐼! , which we always take to be 1, denotes the number
of infectious symptomatic individuals at the start of the regional epidemic.
Subscripts attached to state variables are used to denote subpopulations. The subscripts 𝑀
and 𝑃 are attached to variables representing mixing and protected populations, respectively. For
example, the variables 𝑆6 and 𝑆7 denote the population sizes of mixing and protected individuals
who are susceptible to infection. Individuals in a protected population practice social distancing;
individuals in a mixing population do not. The approach that we have taken to model social
distancing is similar to that of Anderson et al. (30).
The incubation period is divided into five stages. The numerical subscripts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
attached to 𝐸 variables indicate progression through these five stages. Exposed individuals in the
incubation period, except for those in the first stage, are taken to be infectious. They are also
taken to lack symptoms. They are either presymptomatic (i.e., individuals who will later develop
symptoms) or asymptomatic (i.e., individuals who will never develop symptoms).
The subscript 𝑄 is attached to variables representing populations of quarantined individuals.
The state variable 𝐼( is a special case; it accounts for symptomatic individuals who are
quarantined as well as individuals who are self-isolating because of symptom awareness.

The parameter 𝑘( characterizes the rate at which infected individuals move into quarantine
because of testing and contact tracing. The parameter 𝑗( characterizes the rate at which
symptomatic individuals self-isolate because of symptom awareness. We recognize that
susceptible individuals may enter quarantine (through contact tracing) but we assume that the
size of the quarantined population is negligible compared to that of the total susceptible
population and that susceptible individuals entering quarantine leave quarantine as susceptible
individuals.
The parameters 𝛽 and 𝑚$ < 1 characterize transmission of disease: 𝛽 characterizes the rate
of transmission attributable to contacts between two mixing individuals, 𝑚$ 𝛽 characterizes the
rate of transmission attributable to contacts between one mixing and one protected individual,
and 𝑚$; 𝛽 characterizes the rate of transmission attributable to contacts between two protected
individuals. Infectious individuals taken to contribute to COVID-19 transmission include those
in the following pools: 𝐸;,6 , … , 𝐸<,6 and 𝐸;,7 , … , 𝐸<,7 , 𝐴6 and 𝐴7 , and 𝐼6 and 𝐼7 . Recall that we
do not consider individuals in the first stage of the incubation period (i.e., individuals in 𝐸#
pools) to be infectious. The assumption is that these individuals are not shedding enough virus to
be infectious (or detectable in surveillance testing).
The variables 𝐸#,6 , … , 𝐸<,6 and 𝐸#,7 , … , 𝐸<,7 denote the population sizes of mixing and
protected exposed individuals in the five stages of the incubation period. The variables
𝐸;,( , … , 𝐸<,( denote the population sizes of quarantined exposed individuals in the five stages.
There is no 𝐸#,( population, as we assume that individuals in the first stage of the incubation
period are unlikely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 or to be reached in contact tracing efforts
before leaving the 𝐸# state. The parameter 𝑘' characterizes disease progression, from one stage
of the incubation period to the next and ultimately to an immune clearance phase. Individuals
leaving the 𝐸< pools enter the immune clearance phase, meaning that they become eligible for
recovery. An individual leaving an 𝐸< pool with symptom onset enters an I pool, whereas an
individual leaving an 𝐸< pool without symptom onset enters an A pool. Individuals in 𝐼 pools are
considered to have mild disease (with the possibility to progress to severe disease).
The dynamics of social distancing are characterized by three step functions (i.e., piecewise
constant functions having only finitely many pieces): 𝑈8 , Λ2 , and 𝑃2 . The subscripts attached to
these functions denote times: 𝜎 is a particular time, whereas 𝜏 is a set of times, as discussed later.
The value of 𝑈8 switches from 0 to 1 at time 𝑡 = 𝜎 > 𝑡! , the start of an initial social-distancing
period. As discussed later, the function Λ= defines a timescale for change in social-distancing
practices for one or more distinct periods of social distancing, and the function 𝑃2 establishes a
setpoint for the fraction of the total population of susceptible and infectious, nonquarantined/non-self-isolated/non-hospitalized individuals adhering to social-distancing practices
for one or more distinct periods of social distancing.

The parameter 𝑓& denotes the fraction of infected individuals who never develop symptoms
(i.e., the fraction of all cases that are asymptomatic). The variables 𝐴6 and 𝐴7 denote the sizes of
the populations of mixing and protected individuals who have been infected, progressed through
the incubation period, are currently in the immune clearance phase, and will never develop
symptoms. The parameter 𝑐& characterizes the rate at which asymptomatic individuals recover.
The variable 𝑅 tracks recoveries of asymptomatic individuals, symptomatic individuals with
mild disease, and symptomatic (hospitalized) individuals with severe disease. All individuals
who recover are assumed to have immunity.
The variables 𝐼6 and 𝐼7 denote the sizes of the populations of mixing and protected
symptomatic individuals with mild disease. The parameter 𝑐+ characterizes the rate at which
symptomatic individuals with mild disease recover or progress to severe disease. The parameter
𝑓) is the fraction of symptomatic individuals who progress to severe disease requiring
hospitalization. As a simplification, we assume that all individuals with severe disease are
hospitalized. The variable 𝐻 represents the population size of hospitalized individuals, which are
taken to be quarantined. Thus, the model does not consider nosocomial transmission.
The parameter 𝑓* denotes the fraction of (hospitalized) individuals with severe disease who
recover. The parameter 𝑐) characterizes the hospital discharge rate, i.e., the rate at which
hospitalized individuals with severe disease either recover or die. The variable 𝐷 tracks deaths.
The time-dependent terms 𝜙6 (𝑡, 𝜌) and 𝜙7 (𝑡, 𝜌) appearing in Equations (5)–(8) represent
the effective population sizes of infectious individuals in the mixing and protected
subpopulations, respectively. These quantities are defined as follows:
𝜙6 (𝑡, 𝜌) ≡ 𝐼6 + 𝜌% ^𝐸;,6 + 𝐸>,6 + 𝐸?,6 + 𝐸<,6 _ + 𝜌& 𝐴6

(22)

𝜙7 (𝑡, 𝜌) ≡ 𝐼7 + 𝜌% ^𝐸;,7 + 𝐸>,7 + 𝐸?,7 + 𝐸<,7 _ + 𝜌& 𝐴7

(23)

where 𝜌 = (𝜌% , 𝜌& ), 𝜌% is a constant characterizing the relative infectiousness of presymptomatic
individuals compared to symptomatic individuals and 𝜌& is a constant characterizing the relative
infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals compared to symptomatic individuals. Recall that we
assume that individuals in the first stage of the incubation period (i.e., individuals in either the
𝐸#,6 or 𝐸#,7 population) are not infectious. We also assume that the individuals in these
populations cannot be quarantined until after transitioning to the 𝐸;,6 or 𝐸;,7 population
(because they are assumed to test negative and because contact tracing is assumed to be too slow
to catch individuals in the transient first stage of incubation). Recall that individuals in the 𝐴6 ,
𝐴7 , and 𝐴( populations are defined as individuals who became infected, passed through all five
stages of the incubation period, are currently in the immune clearance phase, and will never
develop symptoms. Thus, individuals in the exposed 𝐸 populations include both presymptomatic

individuals (i.e., individuals who will enter the 𝐼 populations) and asymptomatic individuals (i.e.,
individuals who will enter the 𝐴 populations).
The time-dependent terms 𝑈8 (t), 𝑃2 (𝑡), and Λ2 (𝑡) appearing in Equations (5)–(10), Equations
(13) and (14) and Equations (16) and (17) are step functions defined as follows:
𝑈8 (𝑡) = q

where 𝜎 > 𝑡! is the time at which widespread social distancing initially begins, the integer 𝑛 ≥ 0
is the number of societal (major/widespread) shifts in social-distancing practices after the initial
onset of social distancing, each 𝑝0 < 1 is a parameter characterizing the quasi-stationary fraction
of susceptible individuals practicing social distancing during the (𝑖 + 1)th period of social
distancing, each 𝜆0 is a constant defining a timescale for change in social-distancing practices
during the (𝑖 + 1)th period of social distancing, 𝜏 = {𝜏! , … , 𝜏,1# }, 𝜏! ≡ 𝜎, 𝜏,1# ≡ ∞, and
𝜏01# > 𝜏0 for 𝑖 = 0, … , 𝑛 − 1. The value of 𝑃2 (𝑡) defines a setpoint for the quasi-stationary size
of the protected population of susceptible individuals: 𝑃2 (𝑡) × 100% of the total susceptible
population. The value of Λ2 (𝑡) determines how quickly the setpoint is reached. As indicated in
Equations (25) and (26), we only consider step-changes in the values of 𝑃2 (𝑡) and Λ2 (𝑡), a
simplification. Thus, for a period during which social-distancing practices are intensifying
(relaxing), we increase (decrease) the value of 𝑃2 (𝑡) at the start of the period in a step-change
and then hold it constant until the next step-change, if any.
Full Description of the Auxiliary Measurement Model
To determine how consistent a particular parameterization of the compartmental model is
with available COVID-19 surveillance data, we need to define a quantity—a model output—that
corresponds to daily reports of the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases. Case reporting
by public health officials is typically daily. We expect that the vast majority of cases are detected
because of symptom-driven (vs. random) testing and/or presentation in a clinical setting.
Accordingly, as a simplification, we assume that individuals detected in surveillance are
symptomatic. To define a model output comparable to the number of new cases reported on a
given day, we start by considering the predicted cumulative number of presymptomatic
individuals who become symptomatic while evading quarantine (because of contact tracing) until

at least the onset of symptoms, which we will denote as 𝐶@ . According to the model, the time rate
of change of 𝐶@ is given by the following equation:
𝑑𝐶@
= (1 − 𝑓& )𝑘' (𝐸<,6 + 𝐸<,7 )
𝑑𝑡

(27)

The right-hand side of this equation gives the rate at which non-quarantined presymptomatic
individuals exit the incubation period and enter the immune clearance phase, in which they are
symptomatic and therefore taken to be detectable in local surveillance efforts.
Equation (27) and the ODEs of the compartmental model form a coupled system of
equations, which can be numerically integrated to obtain trajectories for the state variables and
𝐶@ , the expected cumulative number of symptomatic cases. From the trajectory for 𝐶@ , we obtain
a prediction for 𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ), the expected number of new COVID-19 cases reported on a given
calendar date 𝒟A , from the following equation:
𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ) = 𝑓" [𝐶@ (𝑡01# ) − 𝐶@ (𝑡0 )]

(28)

where 𝑓" is taken to be an adjustable region-specific parameter characterizing the time-averaged
fraction of symptomatic cases detected. Equation (28) completes the formulation of our
measurement model. 𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ) is the model output that we compare to 𝛿𝐶0 , the number of new
cases reported on calendar date 𝒟A .
The Adjustable and Fixed Parameters of the Compartmental Model and Auxiliary Measurement
Model
The parameters of the compartmental model (Equations (5)–(26)) and the auxiliary
measurement model (Equations (27) and (28)) are taken to have either adjustable or fixed values.
The adjustable parameter values are estimated (daily) through Bayesian inference on the basis of
surveillance data (i.e., reports of newly detected cases). The fixed parameter values are held
constant during inference; they are based on non-surveillance data and/or assumptions, which are
discussed in the section below. In this section, we simply delineate the parameters with
adjustable and fixed values. The compartmental model formulated for a given regional epidemic
has a total of 16 + 3(𝑛 + 1) parameters. The value of 𝑛 is structural; it sets the number socialdistancing periods considered.
The value of n corresponds to the number of periods of distinct social-distancing behaviors
that follow an initial period of social distancing, which we take to begin at time 𝑡 = 𝜎 > 𝑡! .
Here, we take 𝑛 = 0 or 1 for all regional epidemics of interest. Usually, we set 𝑛 = 0. In cases
where we set 𝑛 = 1, this setting was motivated by second wave-type dynamics suggested by the
surveillance data, which we take to indicate a relaxation of social-distancing practices at time
𝑡 = 𝜏# > 𝜎. The parameters of the initial social-distancing period are 𝜎, 𝑝! , and 𝜆! . The

parameters of the second social-distancing period, if considered, are 𝜏# , 𝑝# , and 𝜆# . Thus, there
are 3(𝑛 + 1) social-distancing parameters, all of which are taken to be adjustable.
In addition to the 3(𝑛 + 1) social-distancing parameters, we have 16 other parameters. Three
of these define the initial condition: 𝑡! , 𝑆6 (𝑡 = 𝑡! ) = 𝑆! , and 𝐼6 (𝑡 = 𝑡! ) = 𝐼! , where 𝑡! is the
time at which the epidemic begins, 𝑆! is taken to be the total population of the region of interest,
and 𝐼! (the initial number of infected individuals) is always taken to be 1 (an assumption). We
take 𝑡! to be adjustable and 𝑆! and 𝐼! to be fixed. The value of 𝑆! is set on the basis of population
estimates by the US Census Bureau for the metropolitan statistical areas of interest (13), which
are delineated by the US Office of Management and Budget (10).
There is only one more adjustable parameter of the compartmental model: 𝛽, which
characterizes the rate of disease transmission attributable to contacts among individuals within
the mixing population. In the period before the onset of social distancing, from 𝑡! to 𝜎, when
𝑆6 /𝑆! ≈ 1, the instantaneous rate of disease transmission is 𝛽𝜙6 (𝑡, 𝜌), where 𝜙6 (𝑡, 𝜌) is the
effective number of infectious individuals at time 𝑡, a weighted sum of the numbers of
symptomatic, presymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals determined by 𝜌 = (𝜌% , 𝜌& ). We
assume that exposed individuals after the first stage of disease incubation are infectious, as are
asymptomatic individuals in the immune clearance phase who have passed through all 5 stages
of disease incubation and who will never develop symptoms.
The remaining 12 parameters of the compartmental model, which are taken to have fixed,
region-independent values, are as follows: 𝑚$ , 𝜌% , 𝜌& , 𝑘' , 𝑘( , 𝑗( , 𝑓& , 𝑓) , 𝑐& , 𝑐+ , 𝑓* and 𝑐) . Our
estimates for these parameters are discussed in the section immediately below. It should be noted
that settings for 𝑓* and 𝑐) do not affect predictions of new cases because these parameters
characterize recovery/morbidity of hospitalized individuals. The parameter 𝑓* is the fraction of
hospitalized individuals who recover, and the parameter 𝑐) characterizes the hospital discharge
rate. Although nosocomial disease transmission is a significant concern, we assume that
hospitalized individuals are effectively quarantined such that the overall rate of disease
transmission in a given region is insensitive to the number of hospitalized individuals in that
region.
Estimates of 12 Fixed Parameter Values of the Compartmental Model
Here, we summarize the rationale/justification for each of our estimates for the values of the
following 12 parameters of the compartmental model: 𝑚$ , 𝜌% , 𝜌& , 𝑘' , 𝑘( , 𝑗( , 𝑓& , 𝑓) , 𝑐& , 𝑐+ , 𝑓* ,
and 𝑐) . These estimates are assumed to apply to all regions, i.e., we take these parameters to
have region-independent values.
The parameter 𝑚$ characterizes the effects of social distancing on disease transmission.
Without social distancing, all contacts responsible for disease transmission are between mixing
individuals (i.e., between individuals in the 𝐼6 and 𝑆6 pools) and the rate of transmission is

characterized by 𝛽. With social distancing, there are contacts involving 1 individual in a mixing
population and 1 individual in a protected population (e.g., between individuals in the 𝐼6 and 𝑆7
pools or in the 𝑆6 and 𝐼7 pools) and also contacts involving 2 individuals in protected
populations (e.g., between individuals in the 𝐼7 and 𝑆7 pools). In the model, the rates of
transmission associated with these types of contacts are characterized by 𝑚$ 𝛽 and 𝑚$; 𝛽,
respectively. We can be confident that social distancing is protective (i.e., 𝑚$ < 1) but there is
little information available to suggest the magnitude of the effect. We arbitrarily set 𝑚$ = 0.1,
which can be interpreted to mean that a susceptible individual practicing social distancing has a
10-fold smaller chance of becoming infected than a susceptible individual that is not practicing
social distancing. In exploratory analyses, wherein we allowed 𝑚$ to be a free parameter, we
found that its inferred value is positively correlated with the extent of social distancing, which is
determined by the relevant social-distancing setpoint parameter (viz., 𝑝! ). Thus, we interpret the
inferred quasi-stationary value of 𝑆7 to be an effective population size. If our estimate for 𝑚$ is
too high (i.e., we underestimate the protective effect of social distancing), the effective size will
be larger than the true size. Conversely, if our estimate for 𝑚$ is too low, the effective size will
be smaller than the true size.
The parameters 𝜌% and 𝜌& characterize the relative infectiousness of individuals without
symptoms during the incubation period and the immune clearance phase, respectively.
Infectiousness is compared to that of a symptomatic individual. Using a one-step real-time
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay to quantify viral RNA
abundance in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples, Arons et al. (14) determined rRT-PCR
threshold cycle (Ct) values for 17 symptomatic and 24 presymptomatic individuals. The former
group of individuals had typical symptoms, and the latter group of individuals lacked symptoms
at the time of testing but later developed symptoms (within 1 week after testing). At the time of
testing, the median Ct values for symptomatic and presymptomatic individuals were 24.8 and
23.1, respectively. (NB: Ct value is inversely proportional to abundance.) Based on these results
and an assumption that infectiousness is proportional to viral load, we estimate that 𝜌% = 1.1. An
estimate for 𝜌% greater than 1 is consistent with the findings of He et al. (25), who inferred that
viral load is maximal 0.7 d before the onset of symptoms from an analysis of temporal viral load
data and information available about infector-infectee transmission pairs. Over a period of 19 d,
Nguyen et al. (15) performed daily rRT-PCR assays for viral RNA in nasopharyngeal samples
from 17 symptomatic and 13 asymptomatic individuals. Ngyuen et al. (15) developed a curvefitting model for each group to characterize their viral decay kinetics. These models indicate that
the mean Ct value for symptomatic individuals was roughly 90% of the mean Ct value for
asymptomatic individuals over the first week of the study, after which most individuals tested
negative or had a Ct value near the threshold of detection, 40. Thus, we estimate that 𝜌& = 0.9.
The parameter 𝑘' characterizes the duration of the incubation period. In the model, the
incubation period is divided into 5 stages (for reasons explained shortly). The waiting time for
completion of all 5 stages is described by an Erlang distribution with a shape parameter 𝑘 = 5

and a scale parameter 𝜇 = 1/𝑘' . Lauer et al. (12) estimated times of exposure and symptom
onset for 181 confirmed cases and found that the median time between SARS-CoV-2 infection
and onset of COVID-19 symptoms is 5.1 d. Lauer et al. (12) also found that the empirical
distribution of waiting times is fit by an Erlang distribution with 𝑘 = 6 and 𝜇 = 0.88 d. This
latter finding suggests that the empirical waiting time distribution can be reproduced by dividing
the incubation period into 6 stages and setting 𝑘' = 1.14 d4# . However, an Erlang distribution
with 𝑘 = 5 and 𝜇 = 1.06 d has a nearly identical shape. Because simulation costs are reduced by
dividing the incubation period into 5 instead of 6 stages, we considered 5 stages in the model.
The distribution of waiting times estimated by Lauer et al. (12) is reproduced by our model when
we set 𝑘' = 0.94 d4# .
The parameters 𝑘( and 𝑗( characterize testing-driven quarantine and symptom-driven selfisolation. We assume that testing is random. Thus, the number of infected individuals moving
into quarantine per d is the number of infected individuals subject to quarantine times the
fraction of the total population tested per d times a multiplier capturing the effect of contact
tracing. We take the multiplier to be average household size, 2.5 (US Census Bureau). Thus,
based on approximately 500,000 tests per d in the US (https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily)
and a total population of 330 million (https://www.census.gov/popclock/), we estimate 𝑘( =
0.0038 d4# . We assume 𝑗( = 0.4 d4# . With this setting, the median waiting time from onset of
symptoms to initiation of self-isolation is approximately 40 h. A faster timescale for selfisolation is probably not realistic despite general awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic, because
as considered in the study of Böhmer et al. (26), for any given individual, there may be a
prodromal phase of ~1 d marked by non-COVID-19-specific symptoms other than fever and
cough.
The parameter 𝑓& is the fraction of infected individuals who never develop symptoms. We
estimate 𝑓& on the basis of information about the COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess
cruise ship, as recounted by Sakurai et al. (17). Before disembarking, 3,618 passengers and crew
members were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 410 of 712 individuals testing positive for
SARS-CoV-2 were without symptoms at the time of testing. The Ministry of Health, Labour, and
Welfare of Japan (16) reported that 311 (76%) of these individuals remained asymptomatic over
>##

the course of long-term follow-up. Thus, we estimate that 𝑓& = B#; ≈ 0.44. This estimate is
consistent with the results of other studies. Lavezzo et al. (27) estimated that 43% of all
infections are asymptomatic. In the study of Gudbjartsson et al. (28), 7 of 13 individuals detected
to have SARS-CoV-2 infection in random-sample population screening did not report symptoms;
43% of all SARS-CoV-2-positive participants in the study were symptom-free.
The parameter 𝑓) is the fraction of symptomatic individuals progressing to severe disease.
We set 𝑓) such that our model predicts a uniform infection fatality rate (IFR) consistent with that
determined by Perez-Saez et al. (18) from serological survey results and death incidence reports:
0.0064 (~0.64%). For a discussion of other IFR estimates, which tend to be similar, see Grewelle

and De Leo (29). According to our model, IFR is given by (1 − 𝑓& )𝑓) (1 − 𝑓* ). This quantity is
the fraction of all infected individuals predicted to develop symptoms and then to progress to
severe disease (and hospitalization) and finally a fatal outcome. Thus, based on our estimates for
!.!!D?

𝑓& (0.44) and 𝑓* (0.79) and the empirical IFR (0.0064), we set 𝑓) = !.<D ×!.;# ≈ 0.054.
The parameter 𝑐& characterizes the duration of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals in
the immune response phase. For each of 89 asymptomatic individuals, Sakurai et al. (17)
reported the time between the first positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and the first of two serial
negative PCR tests. The mean duration of this period was ~9.1 d. We assume that this period
coincides with the period of infectiousness and that this period encompasses both the incubation
period and the immune response phase. According to our model, the mean duration of the
incubation period is 5/𝑘' for both presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Based on our
earlier estimate that 𝑘' = 0.94 d4# , the mean duration of the incubation period is estimated as
5.3 d. Accordingly, the mean duration of the immune clearance phase for asymptomatic
#

individuals is estimated as 9.1 d − 5.3 d = 3.8 d, and it follows that 𝑐& =
≈ 0.26 d4# .
>.G d
If 𝑓) ≪ 1, the parameter 𝑐+ characterizes the duration of infectiousness of individuals who
develop mild COVID-19 symptoms (i.e., symptoms not severe enough to require
hospitalization). Wölfel et al. (20) attempted to isolate live virus from clinical throat swab and
sputum samples collected from 9 patients at multiple time points after the onset of mild COVID19 symptoms. Roughly 67%, 38%, and 0% of attempts to isolate virus were successful at 6, 8,
and 10 d after infection, respectively. Assuming that a negative culture coincides with loss of
infectiousness, we estimate that 𝑐+ = −

IJ(!.>G)
Gd

≈ 0.12 d4# .

The parameters 𝑓* and 𝑐) characterize the hospital stays of the severely ill. These parameters
affect predictions of COVID-19-caused deaths and hospital resource utilization but do not affect
the predicted transmission dynamics, because we assume that hospitalized patients are
effectively quarantined and do not contribute significantly to disease transmission, i.e., there is
no 𝐼) term in 𝜙6 or 𝜙7 (see Equations (22) and (23)). The parameter 𝑓* is the fraction of
hospitalized patients who recover, and the parameter 𝑐) characterizes the rate at which patients
are discharged (as either recovered or dead). Richardson et al. (19) reported that the overall
median length of hospital stay for 2,634 discharged patients (alive or dead) was 4.1 d. Thus, we
estimate that 𝑐) =

IJ(;)
?.# d

≈ 0.17 d4# . Among the discharged patients, 553 (21%) died. Thus, we

estimate that 𝑓* = 0.79.
Likelihood Function Used in Inference of Model Parameter Values
We assume that the likelihood of a set of adjustable parameter values 𝜃M given a report of
𝛿𝐶0 new cases on calendar date 𝒟0 , which we will denote as ℒ0 (𝜃M ; 𝛿𝐶0 ), is given by the
following equation:

ℒ0 (𝜃M ; 𝛿𝐶0 ) = nbinom(𝛿𝐶0 ; 𝑟, 𝑝0 ) = c

𝛿𝐶0 + 𝑟 − 1 N
d 𝑝0 (1 − 𝑝0 )OP"
𝛿𝐶0 − 1

(29)

where 𝛿𝐶0 is a non-negative integer (the number of new cases reported), 𝑖 is an integer indicating
the date 𝒟0 or the period (𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ); nbinom(𝛿𝐶0 ; 𝑟, 𝑝0 ) is the probability mass function of the
negative binomial distribution NB(𝑟, 𝑝0 ), which has two parameters, 𝑝0 ∈ [0,1] and 𝑟 > 0; and
𝜃M is a model-dependent ordered set of feasible (i.e., allowable) values for the adjustable model
parameters (e.g., 𝑁, 𝑡! , 𝑘, and 𝜃 in the case of the curve-fitting model) augmented with a feasible
value for 𝑟. Recall that 𝑡0 ≡ 𝑡! + 𝑖 d, where 𝑡! > 0 is 0000 hours of 𝒟! , the start date of the local
epidemic. We take the dispersion parameter 𝑟 of NB(𝑟, 𝑝0 ) to be date/time-independent and infer
the value of 𝑟 jointly with the values of the model parameters. Because the deterministic models
are designed to capture the mean behavior of the random reporting numbers, we have to impose
the constraint 𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ) = 𝔼[NB(𝑟, 𝑝0 )] = 𝑟(1 − 𝑝0 )/𝑝0 , which leads to the date/time-dependent
parameter 𝑝0 of the negative binomial distribution:
𝑝0 =

𝑟
.
𝑟 + 𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# )

(30)

If 𝑚 + 1 daily case reports are available, from date 𝒟! to date 𝒟Q , we assume that each
likelihood ℒ0 (𝜃M ; 𝛿𝐶0 ) given by Equations (29) and (30) is independent. Thus, we have
Q

where ℒ(𝜃M ; {𝛿𝐶0 }Q
0-! ) is the likelihood of 𝜃M given all available case reports {𝛿𝐶0 }0-! . Recall
that 𝛿𝐶0 is the number of new cases reported on date 𝒟0 and 𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ) is the model prediction of
𝛿𝐶0 . Furthermore, recall that 𝜃M is defined as a model-dependent ordered set of feasible
adjustable model parameter values augmented with a feasible value for the likelihood function
parameter 𝑟. The identity of 𝜃M depends on whether we are using Equation (31) to make
inferences conditioned on the curve-fitting model or the compartmental model (i.e., we use
Equation (31) in both cases but the identity of 𝜃M depends on the model being considered). The
ordering of parameter values within the set 𝜃M is consistent but arbitrary.

Bayesian Inference and Online Learning
We chose the Bayesian inference framework to parametrize the models with uncertainty
quantification. In Bayesian inference, given a set of data 𝐷, the probability of each set of the
parameters, denoted in 𝜃M is constrained by the Bayes formula
ℙ{𝜃M |𝐷} =

ℙ{𝐷|𝜃M } ℙ{𝜃M }
.
∫R ℙ{𝜃M ′|𝐷 } ℙ{𝜃M ′} d𝜃M ′

(32)

Here, the ℙ{𝜃M } is the prior parameter distribution, which represents our belief of how the model
parameters should distribute in the parameter space Ω, and ℙ{𝐷|𝜃M } is the likelihood of the
parameter set 𝜃M given the dataset 𝐷, that is, ℒ(𝜃M ; {𝛿𝐶0 }Q
0-! ) in Eq. (31). In general, evaluating
the posterior parameter distribution ℙ{𝜃M |𝐷 } is a difficult computation, mainly because of the
high-dimensional integration of the term ∫R ℙ{𝜃M ′|𝐷} ℙ{𝜃M ′} d𝜃M ′, a term often referred to as the
evidence. Thus, for high-dimensional models, one relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
techniques to sample the posterior parameter distribution ℙ{𝜃M |𝐷 }.
In contrast of many modeling analyses which focus on identifying the parameter
distributions, we are interested in projections of the models, whose parameters are inferred by
past data, into the future. To this end, we evaluate the model with a probabilistic parameter set
distributed by the obtained posterior distribution ℙ{𝜃M |𝐷}. Formally, we denote the prediction of
the confirmed cases between future day 𝑡0 and 𝑡01# by our deterministic model with a set of
parameters 𝜃M by 𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ; 𝜃M ). Recall that this deterministic prediction represents the mean of
the fundamentally random new confirmed cases reported in a future interval (𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ). If there
was only parametric uncertainty which propagates through the deterministic model, the
confirmed cases reported in a future interval (𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ) would be distributed according to
∫R 𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ; 𝜃M ) ℙ{𝜃M |𝐷 } d𝜃M . However, there is also observation noise, which we model by a
negative binomial distribution. The observation noise also needs to be injected into the prediction
to quantify the full uncertainty. The full prediction accounting for parametric uncertainty is a
random variable distributed according to
W nbiom c𝑖; 𝑟,

In practice, the above random variable is resampled from the posterior chain derived from the

MCMC sampling. We denote the MCMC posterior chain by q𝜃M , 𝜃M … 𝜃M

Ž. We sample the

posterior chain and denote the resampled parameter set by 𝜃MS and the deterministic prediction of
that resampled parameter in interval (𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ) by 𝐼(𝑡0 , 𝑡01# ; 𝜃MS ). Then, we generate a negative
binomial random number with the first parameter of the negative binomial distribution set as
𝑟S /(𝑟S + 𝐼(𝑡01# , 𝑡0 ; 𝜃MS )) where 𝑟S is the resampled 𝑟 which is also a free parameter in 𝜃MS and is
inferred in the MCMC. We repeat the resampling procedures and use the generated samples to
compute the percentile of the past history and future prediction.
Our aim is to perform the Bayesian inference daily as soon as a new regional confirmed case
number is reported. Although the Bayesian framework allows a sequential analysis, that the
previous derived posterior distribution is used as a prior and the new inference problem involves
only one new data point, in practice, such an analysis is difficult if the posterior distribution
cannot be emulated or interpolated from the discrete posterior chain. Our analysis shows that in
some regions, the posterior is far from Gaussian, making accurate interpolation or emulation
difficult. Thus, we are not adopting this workflow, and instead, we perform the inference with all

the data points collected up to the time of inference. Nevertheless, we warm-start the MCMC
chain from the maximum a posteriori estimator estimated from the previous derived chain, and
we also use the previously derived chain for estimating the optimal covariance matrix for the
proposal of the normal symmetric random-walk Metropolis sampler. This approach allows an
online learning of the optimal proposal which significantly reduces the mixing time.

Technical Details of Approach and Numerical Methods Used in Bayesian Inference
Because the variability of the data due to the regional and temporal differences, it is difficult
to identify a universal sampling strategy (the proposal kernel). Thus, we adopted an adaptive
Metropolis algorithm, specifically Algorithm 4 in Andrieu and Thoms (21) to accommodate the
regional and temporal differences.
For all the model parameters, we assume their priors are uniformly distributed, whether they
are proper or improper. Denote the 0:00 of the calendar date of the first confirmed case in a
specific region by 𝑡TAUVW and the total population of that region by 𝑆! . For the curve-fitting model,
we assume the parameters are bounded by 𝑁 ∈ (0, 𝑆! ), 𝑡! ∈ (𝑡TAUV3 − 21, 𝑡TAUV3 ), 𝜇 ∈ (0, ∞), 𝑘 ∈
(0, ∞), 𝜃 ∈ (0, ∞). For the compartmental model, we assume that the parameters are bounded by
𝑡! ∈ (0, ∞), 𝜎 ∈ (𝑡! , ∞), 𝛽 ∈ (0, ∞), 𝜆 ∈ (0,10), 𝑓7 ∈ (0,1), 𝑓" ∈ (0,1). We assume 𝑟 ∈ (0, ∞)
for both models. We adopted rejection-based sampling to assure the parameter values are
sampled in the hypercube.
We start inference with an isotropic proposal kernel, that randomly perturbs the parameter
values by independent Gaussian proposals whose standard deviations are set to be 5% of the
parameter values. We carry out the standard Metropolis–Hastings algorithm for 5 × 10?
iterations first to identify local minimum. Then, we turned on the adaptive Metropolis algorithm
to calculate the covariance matrix on-the-fly, for another 5 × 10? iteration, when we turned on
an on-the-fly learning for optimal proposed increment, i.e., 𝜆 in Algorithm 4 of Andrieu and
Thoms (21). Because the weight for learning the proposed increment decays 1/iteration (21),
the proposed increment stabilizes after about 10> more iterations. We began to collect the
statistics from 1.5 × 10< iteration, until the simulation finishes at 6 × 10< iterations.
Except for the first time of the procedure (i.e., online learning and day-to-day operation), we
warm start the simulation from the previously obtained best-fit (maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimator) and with the previously obtained covariance matrix and proposed increment. We carry
out standard Metropolis–Hastings algorithms for 2.5 × 10? iterations first to identify a local
minimum, noting that it is often not far away from the previously identified MAP. We then turn
on the adaptive MCMC algorithm to calculate the covariance matrix on-the-fly, again for another
5 × 10? iteration. We then use another 2.5 × 10? iterations to calculate the optimal proposed

increment. We start to collect statistic from 10< iteration to 4 × 10< iteration when the
simulation finishes.
