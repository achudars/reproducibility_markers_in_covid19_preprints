Breaking a complex bio-social phenomenon (epidemic) into its components, considering
the processes that determine its dynamics, formalizing the accepted hypotheses in mathematical
equations, selecting appropriate experimental and statistical material, and constructing a
mathematical model – those are typical tasks of scientific research. A specific data processing
method (balanced identification) and appropriate information technology made it possible to
consider a number of models, determine the general biological laws of the virus-human
interaction (common to all populations), and the country specific social features of epidemic
management in the countries (or cities) under consideration. As the initial data, only new cases
are used. Data from different countries is taken from official sources and processed in a uniform
way. The obtained estimates of the number of undetected infected are lower estimates.
Keywords: mathematical modeling, COVID-19, balanced identification, bio-social system

INTRODUCTION
The dynamics of epidemics (including COVID-19) is determined both by biological
characteristics of the human body vs. virus interaction, and by social aspects of the interaction
between man and society.
Biological features determine:
• “potential” number of people infected by one person,
• the probability of recovery (without isolation),
• “visibility” of symptoms (for identification and subsequent isolation).
Society can manage an epidemic in two ways:
• limit contacts (self-isolation) or make them safer (distancing, masks, etc.),
• identify and isolate those infected.
The paper uses population-based models of the virus spreading in human population
(such as “host-parasite” or “predator-prey”). Particular attention is paid to the (clear) separation
of the purely biological processes of interaction between the predator (virus) and the prey
(human) and the purely social mechanisms of society counteracting an epidemic. When
modeling the dynamics of the epidemic in different countries, biological functions are assumed
to be the same and constant in time, while social functions can differ from country to country
and vary in time.
The epidemic dynamics determined by undetected infected people (UDI) – those
identified are isolated (more or less carefully) by the society, and those not identified continue to
infect others. So, only the population of UDI is considered.

The typical time from infection to the moment when it is contagious (latent period) is
about 4-5 days for COVID-19 (this estimate is not used in the study below), the typical modeling
time is about 100 days. The characteristic times are comparable. Therefore, to describe the
dynamics of UDI, it is necessary to divide the population into groups according to the time
elapsed since the infection, which we will call the duration of infection (DI). Models of this type
have long been known (see reviews by Svirezhev, Logofet, 1978; Hansen, 1986) and are widely
used in demography, ecology and epidemiology.
A singe type of statistical information is used to build (identify) the models – the standard
official data on the number of new (detected per day) cases of infection. Data is used “as is”
without pre-processing. Countries with abnormal data (for example, China) are ignored. The
number of countries present (7 populations) was determined by the limits of showing the
simulation results in one figure clearly. Meanwhile the technology of balanced identification
allows to increase the number several times. The constructed model considers 7 populations –
the populations of Great Britain (Gbr), Germany (Deu), Italy (Ita), Spain (Esp), France (Fra),
Russia excluding the city of Moscow and the Moscow Region (Rus-mos) and the city of
Moscow including the Moscow Region (Mos). The division of Russia into two parts is caused by
the significant difference in the dynamics.
The model under consideration was selected as the one that best fits the quantity and
quality of the selected statistics. The balanced identification method used (Sokolov, Voloshinov,
2018; Sokolov, Voloshinov, 2019) allowed us to quantify how much the accepted set of
hypotheses about the functioning of an object (bio-social system) corresponds to the available
factual material (statistics).
STATISTICAL INFORMATION USED
The model is based on statistics on new cases (of infection):
• UK, Germany, Italy and France – https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data.
• Russia and Moscow – https://www.rospotrebnadzor.ru/about/info/news_time/
• Spain - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Spain
The statistics are normalized in time – for each country, the last date with the number of
infected less than 100 was adopted as 0: for Great Britain analyses starts on 2020.03.05,
Germany – 2020.02.29, Italy – 2020.02.23, Spain – 2020.03.02, France – 2020.02. 29, Russia
(without Moscow and Moscow Region) and Moscow with Moscow Region – 2020.03.20.
Let’s denote the entire array of statistics (dataset)

DS: { nCt,p, , t ∊ [0,Tp]; p∊ [0,P], P=6 },
where nCt,p is the number of new infections at time t in a population (country or city)
with number p.
The initial data for Moscow and the region are illustrated in Figure 1.

DYNAMICS MODEL OF A POPULATION OF UNDETECTED INFECTED PEOPLE
WITH DISTRIBUTION BY DURATION OF INFECTION
This section is concerned with a difference model (such as the Leslie matrix; Svirezhev,
Logofet, 1978; Hansen, 1986), its verbal description, and the discussion of accepted hypotheses.
In parallel with the difference model in curly brackets without explanation, similar equations of
continuous formulation are given. You can restrict yourself to a difference model or even just the
verbal description of the accepted hypotheses. In addition, the Appendix provides a fragment of
the formal model description in the task file, which is used to identify unknown model functions
using balanced identification technology.
The model describes the dynamics of 7 UDP populations. For each population p, its own
submodel is considered. The submodel is characterized by the functions Fp(t) and Ip(t), which
describe social management. Common biological functions are b(τ), µ(τ) and f(τ).
Hypotheses.
The virus does not change. There are no mutations. The functions (b (τ), µ (τ), f (τ)) that
determine the interaction of the virus with the human body do not change over time.
Immunity is not taken into account. Only UDI are considered, the rest of the population is
not taken into account in any way. While the percentage of those who have been ill is small, we
can assume that the virus spreads in an endless population.
Identified infected do not infect further. Quarantine and isolation work: the number of
those infected by identified infected (at the time of infection) is not large and can be neglected,
taking into account the error of the initial data. Although among the medical staff there are a lot
of cases.
There is no migration. Isolated populations are considered. It is assumed that infection
occurs once at the initial moment and migration is not significant compared with the number of
secondary infected. Apparently, the statement is questionable for the beginning of the modeling
interval.
The time step of the model. A time step of 1 day corresponds to the statistical data update
rate.
Maximum DI. max = 16 days. We assume that any UDI stops being contagious after 16
days. It corresponds to the quarantine time (2 weeks).
Population. A population of UDI is considered. The individuals of population can differ
from each other at each time (t) by a single parameter – the time elapsed since the infection (DI),
τ. Sex and age structure, location, liability to disease, immunity etc. are not considered.
The number of UDI at time t with a DI value of  is denoted by n(t,).
The dynamics of such population consists of “DI parameter shift”. For example, the number of
people with a DI equal to 7 days on May 24 equals the number with a DI of 6 days on the
previous day, May 23, minus recovered and identified (put into isolation, quarantined). Thus, for
each of the 7 considered populations p,
np(t+1,τ+1) = np(t,τ) - µ(τ) * np(t,τ) - Fp(t) * f(τ) * np(t,τ)

Figure 2 shows an example – the density of UDI for Moscow.

n(t,) as of May 29
Recovery. The recovery of UDI (and the cessation of the virus spread) is one of the
causes for the decline in population. The number equals µ(τ)*np(t,τ), where µ(τ) ≤ 1 is the
probability of recovery for (DI) . The first two days, the probability of recovery is 0:
µ (0) = 0; µ (1) = 0
{ µ(𝜏) = 0 , 𝜏 ∈ [0,2] }.
Case detection. Another reason for the decrease in the UDI population is case detection
and isolation Fp(t)*f(τ) * np(t,τ), where Fp(t) * f(τ) ≤ 1 is the detection probability, f(τ) is the
biological factor (common for all countries), and Fp(t) is social detection management – a factor
that differs from country to country and varies over time.
The first two days, the probability of detection is 0:
f(0)=0; f(1)=0
{ 𝑓(𝜏) = 0 , 𝜏 ∈ [0,2] }.
Every day, society efforts lead to a greater (or equal) detectability
𝑑𝐹
Fp(t+1)≥ Fp(t)
{ 𝑑𝑡 ≥ 0 }.
For definiteness, we normalize one of the factors:

{ ∫ 𝑓(𝜏 ′ ) 𝑑𝜏 ′ = 1 }

Infectiousness (addition to the UDI population). The number of new UDI (“born” with
zero duration of infection) is determined by the equation
𝜏𝑚𝑎𝑥

16

𝑛𝑝 (𝑡 + 1,0) = 𝐼𝑝 (𝑡) ∑ 𝑏(𝜏 ′ )𝑛𝑝 (𝑡, 𝜏 ′ )

{ 𝑛𝑝 (𝑡, 0) = 𝐼𝑝 (𝑡) ∫ 𝑏(𝜏 ′ )𝑛𝑝 (𝑡, 𝜏 ′ ) 𝑑𝜏 ′ }

𝜏′ =0

0

where Ip(t) * b(τ) is the number of new infected from one UDI with DI equal to τ (contagiousness
or infectiousness of the undetected infected at time t with the duration of infection τ), b(τ) is the
biological factor of the emergence of new infected (general), and Ip(t) is social infectiousness
management – a factor that differs from country to country and varies over time. The first two
days and on the last one (16th) the probability of recovery is 0:
b(0)=0; b(1)=0
{ 𝑏(𝜏) = 0 , 𝜏 ∈ [0,2] }
b(16)=0.
For definiteness, we normalize one of the factors:
16

∑ 𝑏(𝜏 ′ ) = 1
𝜏 ′ =0

𝜏𝑚𝑎𝑥

{ ∫ 𝑏(𝜏 ′ ) 𝑑𝜏 ′ = 1 }
0

Summing up. The accepted hypotheses and their mathematical formalization determine the
model, which for given:
• general biological functions b (τ), µ (τ), f (τ),
• (country-specific) social administrations Ip(t), Fp(t),
4

• a given initial distribution of the UDI np(0,τ)
allows for each of the populations under consideration to calculate np(t,τ) – the temporal
dynamics of the UDI distributed over the DI.
BALANCED IDENTIFICATION
The identification problem consists of finding unknown common biological functions
b(τ), µ(τ), f (τ) and the population specific functions Fp(t), Ip(t), p∊ [0,P], P=6, so that the model

Obviously, the statement is too vague and not correct. So we use the method of balanced
identification (Sokolov, Voloshinov, 2018; Sokolov, Voloshinov, 2019). We define the
procedure for selecting the entire set of unknown functions by minimizing the functional
depending on the vector of regularization parameters α

defines the curvature of the y(x) function.
The first term of the functional is a measure of the model’s fit to measurements (standard
deviation), addends 2-6 are regularizing additives, the measure of complexity of the model,
which is the curvature of the function (the square of the second derivative) b(τ), µ(τ), f(τ), Fp(t)
and Ip(t). Finally, the last addend minimizes the total number of UDI, so that the solution found
is as small as possible (lower bound).
The regularization parameters α are selected by minimizing the mean square error of
cross-validation.
MODELING RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As a result of the model (7 populations) identification based on data on new cases, the
general biological functions (b (τ), µ (τ), f (τ)) were determined, and for each population social
controls (Ip(t), Fp(t)), the solution itself (np(t, τ)) and a number of additional indicators
convenient for analyzing the results were found.

The maximum of infectiousness (7 days) corresponds to modern theories about COVID19. Apparently, it is also approximately at this time that the maximum manifestation of
symptoms is observed, which corresponds to the maximum of detection.
Social management (results for different populations. For each population (except
Russia excluding Moscow and the region), the last point with the number of infected less than
100 was taken as 0. Since different countries use different calculation methods, only a qualitative
comparison of the corresponding results is possible.

total amount of UDI decline as a percentage of the total number of the UDI. The difference gives
an increase in percent. The intersection points are zero growth. As of May 30.
The local maximum of the increase of the UDI population in Moscow and the region near
point 40 corresponds to May 1. A similar maximum is observed in Fig. 7.
All the estimates above are lower estimates. This is due to the fact that the number of
undetected infected people is not measured, but is the product of the identification problem
solution, and the optimization criterion for the choice of the solution (the last summand) lowers
the average number of UDI.
Additional information, such as antibody screening results, can be used to estimate the
actual amount of UDI. Assuming that 14% of the Moscow population have antibodies (as per
screening results), i.e. had been or are UDI and formalizing this assumption in the form of an
additional identification condition, the number of UDI will increase tenfold (see Fig. 12), and
the maximum value of UDI will reach 450 thousand (May 5). Under this assessment, by May 5
every 25th Moscow resident was undetected infected, and by May 30 – every 50th.

CONCLUSION
The combination of knowledge about the interaction of the virus with human and human
with society, with experimental data based on the balanced identification method, made it
possible to choose a model with complexity corresponding to the volume and quality of the
experimental material. The resulting functions are consistent with current ideas on the processes
that determine the dynamics of the epidemic.
The authors did not set themselves the task of predicting the dynamics of the epidemic
(such task involves a separate study, with another modified identification procedure). However,
the obtained results suggest the possibility of a forecast for 5-7 days, provided that (for this
period) I(t) and F(t) trends are preserved. Moreover, in this case, it seems possible to estimate the
error of such prediction.
Comparison of possible models (and the choice of a model that is in good agreement with
available observations) was carried out in a very short time (essentially, in a few days). This was
made possible through the use of balanced identification (SvF) technology (Sokolov,
Voloshinov, 2019)1, and the SSOP2 service designed to solve sets of independent optimization
problems on computing resources connected to the optimization modeling subsystem
https://optmod.distcomp.org, deployed on the platform Everest (Sukhoroslov O. et al., 2015).
The technology of balanced identification supports the (evolutionary) modification of the
model – a new (usually more complex) model is built on the basis of the previous one, while the
previously found solution is used as an initial approximation in finding a solution for a new
model. For example, when new data or knowledge appears, it seems justified to change the
accepted hypotheses, primarily taking immunity into account and dividing the population into
additional groups. This approach has already been used to modify the model to take screening
data into account (see Fig. 12).
