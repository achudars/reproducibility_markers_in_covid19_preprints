We employ the Google and Apple mobility data to identify, quantify and classify different degrees of social distancing and characterise their imprint on the
first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and in the United States. We
identify the period of enacted social distancing via Google and Apple data, independently from the political decisions. Interestingly we observe a general
decrease in the infection rate occurring two to five weeks after the onset of
mobility reduction for the European countries and the American states.
COVID-19 has disrupted our way of living with long lasting impact on our social behaviour
and the world economy. At the same time, differently from earlier pandemics, a very large
amount of data has been collected (1–3) thanks, also, to our smartphone dominated society.
1

Smartphones run mobility applications, such as Google and/or Apple Maps, that help humans
navigate. The mobility information stemming from these apps has been harvested by Google
and Apple, which have subsequently made it publicly available on the following websites:
Google and Apple.
In this paper we mine these data to quantify and characterise the effects of social distancing measures enacted by various European countries and American states. An early study of
mobility effects on the pandemic evolution in China can be found in Ref. (4). The Google mobility data, in Google wordings, show movement trends by region, across different categories
of places. As categories we will use “Residential” and “Workplace”, which best describe the
change in people’s behaviour after the implementation of social distancing measures with respect to a baseline day. The latter is defined, according to Google, as the median value from the
5-week period from the 3rd of January to the 6th of February, 2020, predating the wide spread
of the virus in Europe. The data show how visitors to (or time spent in) categorised places
changed with respect to the baseline day. For Apple, the available mobility data represent a relative volume of direction requests per country/region, sub-region or city, compared to a baseline
volume defined on the 13th of January, 2020. We will be using, from Apple, information about
“Driving” and “Walking”, assuming they represent the time spent by people away from home.
For the United States (US), only “Driving” data are available.
Another set of data relevant for this work is related to the virus spreading dynamics, which
we take from the website https://ourworldindata.org/. We normalise the data of each country as
cases per million inhabitants.
The data relative to the total number of infected cases are effectively parameterised using the
High Energy Physics inspired formalism introduced in (5), dubbed epidemic Renormalisation
Group (eRG). The approach has been generalised to take into account the spreading dynamics
across different regions of the world in (6) and the evolution of the second wave pandemic
2

across Europe in (7). The advantage of the eRG formalism resides in the limited number of
coefficients needed to classify the spreading dynamics for each country. More complicated
models have been used in the literature to study the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions,
including mobility, for Europe (8) and the US (9–13), with the latter mostly focusing on local
communities.
Without further ado, following (5, 6), we introduce α(t) below
α(t) = ln (I(t)) ,

(1)

where I(t) is the total number of infected cases per million inhabitants in a given region and ln
indicates its natural logarithm. The function α(t) turns out to be well described by the following
logistic function:
α(t) =

aeγt
.
b + eγt

(2)

Here, a represents the logarithm of the final number of infected cases per million inhabitants,
b denotes the temporal shift from the start of the pandemic and γ measures the flatness of the
curve of the number of new infected cases. Here, and in the following, we will measure the
time t in weeks, so that γ is measured in inverse weeks. It was argued in (5, 6) that, aside from
the trivial temporal shift provided by b and for the first wave of the pandemics, two numbers
are sufficient to characterise the evolution of the number of infected cases per each region, i.e.
a and γ. This fact helps studying the correlation between mobility data and the virus spreading
dynamics for each region. By going beyond the previous parameterisation, we will discover
a finer temporal structure directly related to the effects of the imposed lockdown and social
distancing measures in the different regions.
In this work we focus on a selection of European countries and all of the US states. In
Europe, we considered countries with more than 3 million inhabitants and for which the data
were available. Note that we will only consider the period during which the first wave of the
3

COVID-19 was raging in Europe and in the US.
Using Google and Apple data, we provide a rationale to identify the timing of the social
distancing measure actualisation in each region. European countries and US states adopted different degrees of social distancing measures during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Moreover the severity of the measures changed during the spreading of the epidemic within
each region of the world. This is why we defined the beginning of the impact of social distancing measures in terms of the reduction in the mobility of individuals, rather than on political
decisions.
We mine Google’s Residential and Workplace mobility data since they show movement
trends across different places compared to a reference period before the implementation of any
measure. The Residential and Workplace data are best suited to quantify when and to what
extent people reduced their mobility and increased social isolation. Similarly, for Apple, we
choose Driving and Walking data for Europe and Driving for the US states, expressing them in
terms of a percentage reduction. Note that the Apple data refer to variations in the number of
searches done on the Maps app, more details to be found on the website Apple.
We define an immobility indicator M
 , as described in the section Methods in the supplementary material, in terms of an average mobility reduction in the chosen categories. The average
is taken over six weeks after the beginning of social distancing. This indicator allows to sort
the European countries and the American states based on the hardness of social distancing. We
also define regions with the highest rate of mobility reduction (low mobility, LM) and regions
with the least reduction (high mobility, HM), for Europe and the US separately. The results are
shown in Fig. 1, were we indicate the LM regions in cyan and the HM regions in red, with a
colour gradient representing different shades of mobility being proportional to the value of the
indicator. For Europe, the countries with the smallest mobility grossly correspond to those that
imposed a lockdown, while the highest mobility country is Sweden, where no measures were

Figure 1: The COVID-19 Mobility Map for Europe and the US. The two maps represent
respectively the European and US states with different shades of mobility from the highest (HM)
in bright red to the lowest (LM) in cyan. At the bottom of the figure there are three tadpolelike plots showing correlations between the four mobility reduction categories: Residential and
Workplace from Google, Driving and Walking from Apple. The head of the tadpoles correspond
to the average over 6 weeks after social distancing begins, while the tail indicates a 8 week
average. The colour code in the three plots reflects the maps one. The maps are drawn with
Wolfram Mathematica.
imposed. Nevertheless, even for Sweden the mobility data show a significant variation that allows us to define the beginning of social distancing despite the political decisions. Similarly for
the US states, the lowest LM corresponds to states in the North-East, California and Hawaii,
which imposed lockdown measures. We also noticed that the beginning of the measures, as

5

defined by the mobility data in the US, corresponds to the dates when the schools were closed
in each state (1).
To validate our conclusions, at the bottom of Fig. 1 we show the correlations between
Google and Apple mobility data for Europe (left and central plot) and the US (right plot).
Each region is represented by a tadpole-like symbol, with the head corresponding to the 6-week
average and the tail to the 8-week average. We label each country and state by using the same
colour code as in the maps. The plots show a clear correlation between the percentage change
in each category. We also checked that the same correlation persists when comparing Google
to Apple categories.
We now analyse possible correlations between mobility data and the parameters of the logistic function α(t) such as the infection rate γ and the log of the total number of infected cases a.
To our surprise we find that γ is uncorrelated to the degree of mobility reduction. This implies
that mobility changes have little impact on the velocity of diffusion of the disease. Of course,
mobility data only capture one aspect of the social distancing, thus they do not offer a complete
picture of the situation in various regions. This surprising finding can be interpreted in various
ways. On the one hand, the result may imply that the main factor behind a reduction of γ could
lie in the behaviour of individuals in social occasions (mask wearing, proximity, greeting habits,
to mention a few); on the other hand, it is quite possible that the value of γ does not represent
the effect of the social distancing measures, as it derives from a global fit over a wide timescale.
In other words, the fit values include both the measure and the pre-measure periods.
To push further the analysis, we now explore whether social distancing measures (as defined
via the Apple/Google mobility data) lead to distinct temporal patterns in the European countries
under study and the American states. In the eRG approach, γ is the natural parameter to use for
this task. We assume that, after the measures are enacted, there are two distinct temporal regions
describing the time dependence of the number of infected cases. These two regions, B and C
6

in the illustrative plot in Fig. 2e, are naturally described by two different gammas. We confirm
that such an analysis is possible via a MonteCarlo analysis. We then move to the actual data
and discover that two distinct temporal regions with their own gammas do emerge for several
regions. In Fig. 2 we show the outcome of the fit to the data in terms of the time interval ∆t
between the beginning of social distancing and its effects measured when the infection rate γ
changes. We discover that most countries display a similar ∆t. By fitting the distributions in
Fig. 2c to a gaussian, we find that to the two sigma level we have ∆t = 2.7 ± 1.7 weeks for
Europe and ∆t = 3.3 ± 1.6 weeks for the US. The high compatibility of the two ranges shows
the emergence of a universal time scale for social distancing to be effective.
Another important result is the general and strong reduction of the infection rate measured
within and after ∆t both for Europe and the US, as shown in the left panels of Fig. 2 and
summarised by the red histograms of Fig. 2d.

Discussion
We analysed the mobility data released by Google and Apple to quantify the effects of social
distancing on the COVID-19 spreading dynamics in Europe and in the US. We were able to
classify different shades of social distancing measures for the first wave of the pandemic. After
identifying the countries according to their level of immobility, we observed a strong decrease
in the infection rate occurring two to five weeks after the onset of mobility reduction for the
countries studied here. Another important result is the discovery of a universal time scale after
which social distancing starts showing its impact.
We have also provided an actual measure of the impact of social distancing for each region,
showing that the effect amounts to a reduction by 20% − 40% in the infection rate for most
countries in Europe and 30% − 70% in the US. This is, to the best of our knowledge, a first
global and direct measure of the impact of social distancing. Interestingly, even countries that

Figure 2: Temporal anatomy of COVID-19 social distancing effects. In panel a), we show
∆t and the percentage variation ∆γ in the infection rate for the European countries considered
in this study. In panel b), we show the same for all the US states. In panels c) and d) we display
the same results in the form of histograms, for Europe and the US separately, highlighting that
∆t clusters around similar values. In panel e), we illustrate the subdivision of the first wave

data occurs, B until an effect is observed in the epidemic curve as a change in γ, and C covering
the later times. ∆t equals to the duration of the period B.
did not impose political measures, like Sweden, show a reduction of the infection rate similar to
the ones experiencing a lockdown, suggesting that a certain degree of social restrain occurred
regardless of the political decisions. Our results are compatible with early analysis of local
social distancing measures taken in China (4), where mobility data inter-cities from Baidu was

8

used within a compartmental model.
Using smartphone based open-source mobility data, we showed that it is possible to provide
a temporal anatomy of social distancing. We discovered the emergence of a characteristic time
scale related to when social distancing effects have a measurable impact. This timing can also
be used to quantify the impact of social distancing by determining the variation in infection
rate per country. Finding similar reduction, however, does not imply that the countries have a
similar number of infected cases per million inhabitants. It simply means that there has been a
change in social behaviour. The result of this study, based on the simple eRG approach, lays the
basis for an effective tool for the authorities to evaluate the timing and impact of the imposition
of social distancing measures, in particular related to movement restrictions.

Materials and Methods
Immobility indicator. European countries and US states adopted different degrees of social
distancing measures during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover the severity of
the measures changed during the spreading of the epidemic within each country or state. Rather
than classifying the countries based on their political choices, we use the mobility data provided
by Google and Apple as indicators of the effective hardness of the measures.
To find a measure for the immobility of a given population during the social distancing
period, we define an average percentage variation for each of the four categories: Residential
and Workplace for Google and Driving and Walking for Apple (only Driving is available for
US states). For both mobility datasets, the percentage variations are defined with respect to a
reference date or period predating the exponential growth of the infection cases. The data are
typically very jugged, as illustrated in Fig. 3, mainly due to strong variations over the weekend.
Furthermore, the mobility data feature a sharp decrease followed by a slow return to the preCOVID-19 average. Taking into account this behaviour, it is necessary to define an average
over several weeks, which would allow us to associate a single number to each category and
region.
Firstly, one needs to properly define the beginning of the social distancing period for each
region: we choose to identify it with the time when Google Workplace percentage first drops
by 20% (at this time, typically, all mobility indicators have shown a significant variation). The
ending of the measure period is harder to identify, as the social distancing measures have always
been lifted progressively (3): this appears in the mobility data, as the curves gradually return

to zero, i.e. to the reference period levels, or even above. Thus, we decided to fix the same
averaging period for all the regions we considered. To test the robustness of our conclusions,
we determine the outcome for two choices: 6 and 8 weeks after the effective beginning of
the measures. The tadpole-like plot at the bottom of Fig.1 in the main text demonstrate that
the duration of the averaging period, while changing the value of the mobility reduction, does
preserve the overall trend. In the following, therefore, we will use the 6-week average as our
benchmark.
To be able to classify the countries based on their immobility, we further define an immobility indicator as
M
 (region) =

X |pj (region)|
,
max[|pj |]
j=cat.

(3)

where |pj (region)| is the absolute value of the percentage variation in each category (labelled
by j). For each category, we divide by the maximal value observed in the pool. Note that
for European countries we have 4 categories, so that M
 < 4, while for the US states we have
3 categories, so that M
 < 3. We use this indicator to rank the European countries and the
American states from the ones with high mobility (HM) – small M
 – to the one with low mobility
(LM) – large M
 . The values of the immobility indicator we obtain for the European countries
under study and US states are shown in Fig. 4. The colour code ranges from the highest mobility
region in bright red to the lowest mobility one in cyan, with gradient proportional to the value
of the immobility indicator.

Comparing the virus spreading parameters with mobility data. The epidemic evolution
of the first wave of the CODIV-19 pandemic can be effectively characterised by two parameters:
the infection rate γ and the logarithm of the final number of total infected cases a (5 ), measured
per million inhabitants. We remark, however, that it is risky to compare the number of infected
for different regions due to the different procedures used when identifying the positive cases,

and the different testing rates and strategies. Thus, we assign more physical meaning to the
infection rates γ, which give an accurate temporal characterisation of the epidemic diffusion in
each region.
It is, therefore, natural to hypothesise that regions with higher mobility may have a faster
diffusion rate of the infection, i.e. larger values of γ. To test this hypothesis, in Fig. 5, we show
the Workplace, Residential and Driving reductions versus the infection rates for the European
countries in this study and the US states. To each country or state is associated a racecar-like
symbol: the pilot seat (dot) corresponds to the 6-week average, while the tail to the 8-week
average. Furthermore, the side bars indicate the error from the fits of the epidemic data. The
colour codes match the immobility indicator defined above. The data used to generate the plots

in Fig. 5 are reported in Tables 1 and 3, where we only report the mobility averages over 6
weeks.
Surprisingly, the data do not reveal any particular correlation between the values of γ and
the mobility data. As explained in the main text, this result can be interpreted in various ways.
One possibility, which we will test in the following section, is that the γ from the fit of the first
wave is not the most appropriate measure, as it averages over the infection diffusion before and
after the mobility reduction occurs.

We subdivide the period of the virus diffusion in 3 parts,

as illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 6. Region A extends up to the time when the social distancing starts, t = 0, as defined from the mobility data; at this point Region B begins extending for
a duration ∆t; finally Region C starts at t = ∆t. As the beginning of Region B is determined
by the Google/Apple mobility data, we can probe the existence of a change in γ by fitting the
data in Region B+C with the following function:

that depends on 5 parameters: a, b, γB , γC and ∆t. We then extract the values of the 5 parameters by fitting to the data.
We first test the effectiveness of our method by generating a mock set of data based on the
function in Eq. (4), where we fix γB = 0.7, γC = 0.35 and ∆t = 20 days. An example of the
generated data, overlaid to the generating function, is shown in the right panel of Fig. 6: the

Table 1: First wave fits and average mobility reductions in Europe. Values of the fit for a, b
and γ for the first wave in the 21 European countries considered in this study, together with the
95% CL error. Six week average mobility reduction for Google and Apple categories.

where Ni is the number of cases per day as predicted by the generating function. We generated
100 independent sets of mock data and fitted them to Eq. (4). We found that we can determine
the value of ∆t within a range of two weeks. Furthermore, we define the percentage variation
of the infection rate as
∆γ =

γC − γB
.
γC

(5)

Having acquired confidence in the method, we now apply it to the real data. The results of
the fits are reported in Tables 2 and 4.
