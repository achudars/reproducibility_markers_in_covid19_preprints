Abstract
Governments around the world have implemented preventive measures against the spread
of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this study, we consider a multivariate discrete-time
Markov model to analyze the propagation of COVID-19 across 33 provincial regions in China.
This approach enables us to evaluate the effect of mobility restriction policies on the spread
of the disease. We use data on daily human mobility across regions and apply the Bayesian
framework to estimate the proposed model. The results show that the spread of the disease in
China was predominately driven by community transmission within regions and the lockdown
policy introduced by local governments curbed the spread of the pandemic. Further, we
document that Hubei was only the epicenter of the early epidemic stage. Secondary epicenters,
such as Beijing and Guangdong, had already become established by late January 2020, and the
disease spread out to connected regions. The transmission from these epicenters substantially
declined following the introduction of human mobility restrictions across regions.

Introduction

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses a threat to public health and
has disrupted economic activities globally. Although there are limited policy tools available to
stem the disease spread, restricting human mobility though lockdown or border closure policies
was identified as an effective measure. Simply put, the virus itself cannot move anywhere without
assistance. In many countries, mobility restriction led to the containment of the virus’s spread.
Given the importance of mobility restriction as an effective policy, it is critical to quantify its
effects.
In this study, we consider a multivariate discrete-time Markov model to analyze the propagation
of COVID-19 across 33 provincial regions of China. Thereby, we allow for heterogeneous disease
transmission both within and across regions.1 Our model takes into account human mobility as a
key driver of disease transmission across regions and identifies epicenters of disease propagation,
as well as the effect of mobility restrictions on infection rates. We extract information on daily
human mobility across regions from January 11 to March 15, 2020, from the Baidu-Qianxi (2020)
database and apply the Bayesian framework to estimate the model. The sampling period in use
for our analysis exhibits substantial exogenous variations in human mobility rates due to the high
number of movements around Chinese New Year (January 25) and a sudden decline in movements
after policy interventions were introduced. We evaluate the effect of mobility restrictions on the
disease spread between regions by comparing outcomes under actual and counterfactual human
mobility, which is extracted from the 2019 data.
Our empirical results document substantial heterogeneity in the rate of infection across regions.
The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the lockdown policy in curbing the spread of the
pandemic. The transmission mechanism of the disease in China is found to be predominately
community transmission within all regions. Further, our analysis based on the 2019 mobility data
suggests that the external transmission would not have been suppressed if people had continued
to be allowed to move freely across provincial borders as usual. Interestingly, our results show
that Hubei is not the only epicenter of the early epidemic stage. Other epicenters, such as Beijing
and Guangdong, had already become established by late January 2020. The pandemic radiated
out to the subordinate regions of these cities with varying degrees of severity. Our approach sheds
light on the evolution of the transmission network over time and provides useful insight into the
formulation of lockdown policies amid the pandemic.
The methodological part of the paper draws on and contributes to several literatures. First,
since the outbreak of COVID-19, many studies have provided simulations and predictions using a
deterministic susceptible-infective-recovered (SIR) model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927). The
SIR model divides a well-defined population into three compartments, namely susceptible, infec1

regions (Hong Kong and Macao). Through the paper, we use “region” for the provinces and special administrative
regions.

tive, and recovered individuals, and characterizes disease transmission as individuals’ transition
between these compartments (e.g., Held et al., 2019). As Allen (2017) discusses, however, stochastic modeling of epidemics is essential when the number of infectious individuals is small, and the
transition between the compartments depends on demography and the environment. We consider
a variation of a stochastic SIR model for the 33 regions in China.
Second, the most critical feature of our model is that it captures the impact of human movements on spatio-temporal disease transmission. The quantitative modeling of human movements
has a long-standing history in fields like transportation, tourism, and urban planning. The
use of the gravity model has been popular in these fields (Wilson, 1974; Haynes et al., 1984;
Erlander and Stewart, 1990) as well as in the field of economics (Anderson, 2011; Head and Mayer,
2014). In the epidemiology literature, the gravity model was first applied by Murray and Cliff
(1977). Gravity-type models are also widely adopted in more recent studies (Xia et al., 2004;
Viboud et al., 2006; Balcan et al., 2009; Jandarov et al., 2014). Alternatively, the radiation model,
proposed by Simini et al. (2012), is used to predict spatial disease transmission (Tizzoni et al.,
2014; Kraemer et al., 2019). Both the gravity and radiation models treat the transition probabilities of individuals from one place to another as a function of population sizes and geometric
distances, both of which are almost invariant on a daily basis. By contrast, this study uses known
information on daily human mobility to characterize disease transmission across regions and evaluate the dynamic impact of mobility restrictions.
Third, there is a growing body of literature dedicated to the study of the spread of infections
in China. Wu et al. (2020) study the transmission of COVID-19 from Wuhan to other cities,
combining monthly and daily human mobility data up to January 28, 2020.2 Kraemer et al.
(2020) use human mobility information from Baidu-Qianxi and analyze the disease spread from
Wuhan to other regions between January 1 and February 10, 2020. They predict daily case counts
in the early phase of disease spread using three different models: Poisson, negative binomial, and
log-linear regression. Both Wu et al. (2020) and Kraemer et al. (2020) document the significance
of human mobility from Wuhan in causing the spread of the disease in the early phase. Both
authors also underscore that the effect travel restrictions in Hubei had on containing the spread
of the disease. In our study, we estimate a model that accounts for disease transmission across all
regions, using data spanning from the beginning of the epidemic until the end of the first wave in
China. Our result is consistent with the existing findings, in that we show that Hubei is the earliest
epicenter. However, we also show that additional regions became epicenters in an early phase of
the pandemic in China. Thus, our results suggest that local government interventions, such as
lockdown in Wuhan, cannot fully explain the containment of the disease. Mobility restriction
across regions is essential. Our research complements the existing research by providing a more

complete understanding of the spread of the disease using a broad and well-defined framework.
Lastly, we contribute to the large body of literature that analyzes infection control in epidemiology (Wickwire, 1977; Sethi, 1978) and in economics (Wiemer, 1987; Philipson, 2000; Gersovitz and Hammer,
2004; Rowthorn and Toxvaerd, 2012). The economic literature theoretically analyzes the optimal
control of infection from the perspective of a social planner and discusses how public policies, such
as subsidies or taxes, can provide individuals with the required incentives to achieve the social
planner’s first-best solution. Our empirical results underscore the importance of coordination between central and local governments. In the presence of human mobility across regions, regional
epicenters can quickly become established and transmit the disease to connected regions. Thus,
if the primary goal is to eliminate the disease entirely, the central and local governments must
implement preventive measures simultaneously.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces a variation of the stochastic SIR model and details the model specifications. Section 3 explains the data in use and the
estimation method. Section 4 presents the estimation results and Section 5 concludes.

Model

This section first introduces the variation of the susceptible-infective-recovered (SIR) model applied in this study. Subsequently, it explains the specification of internal and external disease
transmission in the model.

2.1

Stochastic SIR Model with Spatial Effects

We apply a variation of stochastic SIR model to describe the evolution of three variables: Sjt , Ijt
and Rjt , which denote the number of susceptible, infective, and recovered individuals in region j
at time t, respectively. Also, let Djt denote the cumulative number of deaths by t and let Nj be
the total population in region j. Then, we have the following identity: Nj = Sjt + Ijt + Rjt + Djt .
We observe regional panel data of (Ijt , Rjt , Djt, Nj ) for region j = 1, . . . , J and time t = 0, . . . , T
with J and T denoting the sample size of regions and time periods, respectively. In what follows,
we use Ft to denote the available information set at time t.
We denote by ∆Ij,t+1 the number of transitions from susceptible to infected states in region j
at time t + 1. The number of newly infected individuals ∆Ij,t+1 is assumed to be a random variable
following the Poisson distribution conditional on Ft , with the conditional mean given by
E[∆Ij,t+1 |Ft ]


 I

+ λjt Sjt .
= βjt
Nj

(1)

At its core, the equation above follows the Bass model (Bass, 1969), which was originally proposed
for describing the diffusion of new products. The key feature of the Bass model is that the accep4

tance of a new product is driven by either internal influences, such as contagious adopters to which
other individuals are connected, or external influences, such as mass media or commercials. The
distinction between internal and external influences is adopted by Fibich (2016) in a deterministic
SIR model. Similarly, we can interpret the term βjt Ijt /N as region j’s internal infection rate,
which depends on the proportion of infected individuals Ijt /N and the internal transmission rate
βjt . Further, we consider the term λjt as the external infection rate, which reflects the rate of
infection attributable to transmission from outside of region j. If the border to region j is closed,
the external effect λjt equals zero and the model becomes the standard stochastic SIR model (e.g.,
Allen, 2008).
To describe the state transition from the infected state, we use a Markov chain model in which
infected individuals either remain infected or move to another state: recovery or death. More
D
specifically, let ∆R
j,t+1 := Rj,t+1 − Rjt and ∆j,t+1 := Dj,t+1 − Djt be changes in the number of
recoveries and deaths, respectively. We assume that the transition probability from the infected
state at time t follows a multinomial distribution conditional on Ft , satisfying that E[∆R
j,t+1 |Ft ] =
γIj,t and E[∆D
j,t+1 |Ft ] = δIj,t . Here, the parameters γ and δ are used to represent the recovery and
death rates, respectively. Given the stochastic transition among all states, the number of infected
and susceptible individuals at time t + 1 are given by the following state equations:

2.2

D
Ij,t+1 = Ijt + ∆Ij,t+1 − ∆R
j,t+1 − ∆j,t+1 ,

(2)

Sj,t+1 = Sjt − ∆Ij,t+1 .

(3)

Internal Transmission

The internal transmission rate βjt measures to what extent contacts between an infected individual
and the susceptible population at time t leads to the transmission of the pathogen. Thus, it can
be interpreted as the number of “effective” contacts. We allow for βjt to vary per region and across
time. This is because the contact frequency depends on region-specific characteristics, such as
population density, as well as time-varying factors, such as policy intervention (e.g. contact tracing
and forced quarantine) and behavior changes (e.g. better hygiene practices and social distancing).
In China, almost all local governments declared the top-level state of emergency in the early phase
of the pandemic (January 23-25, 2020), which effectively induced changes in individuals’ behavior.
Thus, we assume that intervention by local governments affects internal transmission gradually.
Specifically, we consider the following specification:
log βjt = log βj,t−1 + αj Xj,t−h ,

(4)

where Xj,t−h is an observed dummy variable taking the value of 1 if the local government in region
j has activated the top-level health emergency response at time t − h and 0 otherwise. This Xj,t−h

5

reflects the implementation of various intervention policies that we collectively call the lockdown
policy. We consider a lag h > 0 to account for lagged effects of the policy intervention and set four
days (h = 4) for our estimation.3 The parameter αj is allowed to be heterogeneous across regions,
reflecting different measures taken by local governments and regional characteristics. The timevarying parameter βjt in (4) depends on the initial value βj,0 and the response to the intervention
αj .4 We specify a hierarchical structure for the transmission parameters across regions, by using
a bivariate normal distribution: (log βj,0, αj )′ ∼ N(µ, Σ) with mean µ := (µβ , µα )′ and variance
matrix Σ. Under this specification, the average of the internal transmission rate without any
control is given by E[βj,0 ] = exp(µβ + 1/2Σ11 ) with Σ11 denoting the (1,1)-element of Σ, while the
effect of intervention on average is given by E[αj ] = µα .

2.3

External Transmission

Using Baidu’s daily mobility data, we construct a measure of the “intensity” of the disease transmission between regions. The mobility data includes an outflux mobility index for all regions and
out
details the proportion of travelers between regions. We use Mkt
to denote the outflux mobility
index in region k at time t and we use Pkjt to represent the proportion of travelers from region
out
k to region j at time t. The mobility index Mkt
represents a relative strength measure of the
outflux, which is scaled by Baidu’s proprietary method, rather than the numbers of outflux. This
out
index is comparable across regions and time. The change of Mkt
from its standard level reflects
mobility restrictions, which we discuss in the supplementary material. Additionally, we observe the
proportion of daily travelers Pkjt between the 31 mainland regions in the sample of 33 provincial

regions, which means Hong Kong and Macao are excluded. We impute the entries for Hong Kong
and Macao based on the radiation model (Simini et al., 2012). In our supplementary material,
we demonstrate that the prediction of influx based on the imputed Pkjt value traces the index of
human influx well. It also outperforms the prediction using only the radiation model.
out
We use Mkt
Pkjt to measure the (scaled) flux from origin k to destination j and then construct
out
an “intensity” of infected flux from origin k to destination j at time t by Mk,t−h
Pkj,t−h (Ikt /Nk ) with
a lag h > 0 in the mobility measure. As there is a time lag between getting infected and showing
symptoms, our formulation takes into account that travelers from origin k at time t − h face case

counts Ikt , which are recorded at t. Given the “intensity” of daily infected flux, we consider the
3

In the existing literature the mean incubation period of COVID-19 is estimated as roughly 5 days (see Li et al.,
2020; Kraemer et al., 2020, among others).
4
Our specification allows βjt to approach zero in consideration of the draconian measures adopted in China and
the suppression of the disease in the first wave. Alternatively, βjt could be set to approach a non-zero value as in
Fernández-Villaverde and Jones (2020). Their dynamics can be considered as a special case of the transfer function
model in Box and Tiao (1975) for intervention analysis.

λjt =

Ikt
θt X out

Nj k6=j
Nk

(5)

The time-varying parameter θt reflects the strength of external transmission and also normalizes
out
the unit because the index Mkt
is a scaled measure. As in the specification for βjt , we allow θt to
respond to policy intervention gradually, i.e., log θt = log θt−1 + ρXj,t−h , where ρ is a parameter.

Data and Estimation Method

3.1

Data

We use the daily data on COVID-19 infection and individuals’ mobility from January 11 to March
15, 2020. The daily data of the infection, death, and recovery cases for each region are obtained
from the National Health Commission of China and its affiliates.5 The human mobility data is
obtained from Baidu Migration (Baidu-Qianxi, 2020). The data provides a daily outflux index for
each of the 33 regions as well as the destinations of the outflux. For our counterfactual analysis, we
use the mobility data set of 2019 from Baidu-Qianxi matched according to the Chinese New Year.
The plots of the outflux in both 2020 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. The outflux indices before
the Chinese New Year in both 2019 and 2020 are dominated by provinces such as Guangdong,
Zhejiang, and Beijing. It is expected that most workers would be leaving these areas to return for
their home provinces for the holiday. For Hubei, the outflux was moderate in both years. The
outflux reduced to a negligible level at the time when the lockdown policy prevailed.

3.2

Estimation Method

We adopt a Bayesian framework for estimation. Given the information on infection, recovery and
death cases, we can estimate our model separately for the infection and the recovery and death.
In our model, the number of recovered and death cases follows a multinomial distribution. Thus,
the likelihood of the parameters of recovery rate γ and death rate δ has an analytic form. We use
a standard random-walk Metropolis sampler with uninformative prior.
For the new case counts following the Poisson distribution, we simulate the posterior distribution using the algorithm in Chib et al. (1998), which is based on data augmentation and a
Metropolis-Hastings-within-Gibbs sampler. We divide the set of parameters into J + 2 blocks:
{(log βj,0, αj )}Jj=1, (µ, Σ), and (log θ0 , ρ), and then sample sequentially using their conditional posteriors. For each block of {(log βj,0 , αj )}Jj=1, we use a multivariate-t proposal density whose mean
and covariance are computed from the mode and Hessian of the conditional posterior. For (µ, Σ),

we specify a Gaussian-inverse Wishart prior, NIW (µ∗ , κ∗ , Λ∗ , ν ∗ ), with µ∗ = (−1, −0.1)′ , κ∗ = 1,
Λ∗ = diag(1, 0.05), and ν ∗ = 10. This prior is weakly informative in µ and moderately informative
in the variance matrix Σ . Lastly, the block (log θ0 , ρ) is updated using a Gaussian prior N(π, Ω)
with π = (0.1, −0.1)′ and Ω = diag(0.1, 0.1). As the posterior of (log θ0 , ρ) depends on all J × T
observations, the contribution of the prior is minimal.

Empirical Results

This section first presents the estimation result for the heterogeneous internal infection rate and the
effect of the regional intervention. We then compare the results of internal and external infection
and provide additional findings based on a transmission network between regions.

4.1

Transmission Parameter across Regions

In Figure 2, we present the estimation result of internal transmission rates. Panel (a) of Figure 2
shows the posterior means of the initial transmission parameter, βj,0 . The significant heterogeneity
in the initial infection rate is evident here. Hubei has the highest value with a very tight posterior
8

credible interval. Panel (b) of Figure 2 reports the transition of posterior means of the internal
transmission rate βj,t, which depicts the effects of policy intervention. The top-level health emergency response was activated for January 23-25, 2020, in all regions, except Xizang, which went
into the state of emergency on January 30, 2020. As in equation (4), the number of new infections
is shown to be affected by the policy implemented five days before. In Figure 2, the effect of the
intervention is evident but not immediate; it shows that for most regions, it took 4 to 7 days for
βjt to decrease to half of its original value. The posterior mean of recovery rate γ is 4.15% with a
95% credible interval (4.11%,4.18%). The posterior mean of death rate δ and 0.213%, with a 95%
credible interval (0.206%,0.220%).

Transmission Rates: External versus Internal

In combination with the lockdown policy, it is important to specifically study human mobility
in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis decomposes the expected number of
9

infections into infections resulting from internal and external transmission for all regions. Figure
3 presents results for four regions, each of which represents a different region, but all have similar characteristics. Namely, we consider megacities (Beijing), the neighboring regions of Hubei
(Hunan), the secondary epicenters (Guangdong), and the special administrative regions outside
mainland China (Hong Kong).

Notes: The blue area represents the expected number of infections due to the external infection and the pink area
represents the expected number of infections due to internal infection.

Internal transmission in Beijing and Guangdong follows a similar pattern with an exponential
increase from the beginning of the outbreak, which dominates the external transmission influence.
In these regions, there is an initial peak during the Chinese New Year (January 24 - February
2, 2020). This finding is empirical evidence that the pandemic had already expanded outside
of Wuhan as early as late January 2020. By this time, other major cities can be considered to
have been suffering from localized outbreaks already. On the other hand, the dominating form of
transmission in Hunan is external until January 27. Similarly, in Hong Kong, external transmission
dominates as the source of infection until February 5. Both internal and external transmission
subsequently exhibit an exponential decrease due to unprecedented policy interventions, such as
stay-at-home instructions and extended public holidays. The only exception to this observation is
the evidence of internal transmission in Hong Kong, which still increased substantially following
February 5 until it stabilized on February 15.
10

Figure 4 presents the expected number of infections from external transmission in all regions.
It is not surprising to see relatively high external infections in Hunan, an area that shares a border
with Hubei. External transmissions peaked during the holiday periods across most regions and
reduced to a negligible level by February 15. Guangdong shows the highest external infection rate,
which also peaked later than most regions. This can be attributed to the large numbers of migrant
workers returning from their hometown following the Chinese New Year.

Notes: The expected number of infections due to external transmission is reported for all regions, and lines for the
four representative cities are highlighted.

To shed further light on these observations, we also conduct an analysis that applies 2019
mobility data. Specifically, the lockdown effect is maintained but the 2020 mobility data is replaced
with the 2019 data to isolate interactive fixed effects of mobility across regions and time, following
Bai (2009).6 The results are reported in Figure 5. The first conclusion which can be drawn from
this analysis is that the lockdown policy is effective. This is clear because the exponential decay of
the external transmission is still evident across all 33 regions. However, if mobility is maintained at
its usual level as indicated by the interactive fixed effects, the exponential decay would be delayed,
resulting in much more significant external transmission rates across regions, except for Hong
Kong. Hong Kong is an exceptional case because most of its external transmission originated from
Guangdong (its only neighbor). Outflux from Guangdong in 2020 was significantly higher than its
usual level in January. This led to a higher influx in Hong Kong during this time. Consequently,
this abnormal influx in 2020 resulted in a high number of external transmissions in Hong Kong at
the early stage of the outbreak.
6

For the counterfactual analysis, we first match the periods of 2019 and 2020 data according to the Chinese New
Year and then extract interactive fixed effects from the 2019 data. This approach decomposes daily human mobility
across regions into daily and regional factors in a flexible yet parsimonious manner. More details are provided in
the supplementary material.

4.3

Transmission Network

The transmission network between the regions of China is observed to evolve on each day of the
pandemic. Kraemer et al. (2020) focuses on the transmission from Wuhan to the rest of China and
they conclude that the propagation of COVID-19 in China during the early stage of the outbreak
was mostly explained by human mobility originated from Wuhan. However, the authors did not
consider the mobility network among the rest of China’s geography, and thus, the scope of analysis
of the transmission channels is limited. The main advantage of the model developed in this study is
that it enables the transmission network to be analyzed on a more granular level. This means that
the sources of external transmission and their respective intensities can be identified. Specifically,
based on (5), we can obtain the rate of external transmission from region k to region j,

Following the literature on network theory (e.g., Aldous and Wilson, 2003), we can interpret the
square matrix consisting of Ajkt for j, k = 1, . . . , 33 as an adjacency matrix of a directed graph
P
with weighted directions Ajkt from k to j at time t. The sum j6=k Ajkt represents the diseases
12

transmissions which originated from region k and moved to the other regions at time t.
P
Figure 6 presents the heatmap of j6=k Ajkt , thus clarifying the top 10 most influential regions,

that is, the regions which were the source of the most transmissions, over time. Hubei stands out as
the primary exporter of the infection during the Chinese New Year holidays, though results show
that secondary epicenters, such as Beijing, Guangdong, and Shanghai, started being a significant
source of transmission from around January 22. The outflux from epicenters, including the primary
one, Hubei, gradually diminished following the enactment of policy interventions.

Notes: The horizontal axis shows days from January 16 to February 4 and the vertical axis shows ten regions,
which arePthe origins of the ten highest external daily transmission to the other regions. The heatmap reports
values of j6=k Ajkt for each origin k.

To examine the transmission network more closely, we present a section of the transmission
network on January 27, 2020, in Figure 7. All the regions in the network are depicted in the
figure according to their geographic location. The arrows reflect transmission directions. The
lines display transmissions with Akjt greater than two, whereby the line width is proportional to
the transmission strength. Figure 7 shows that Hubei is the primary epicenter, particularly for
geographically proximate provinces (e.g., Henan and Hunan), but also that secondary epicenters
such as Beijing, Guangdong, and Shanghai, have already developed on this date. The dynamic
migration between the secondary epicenters—which are cultural and economic centers—and the
rest of China accelerated the propagation of the disease. Regions such as Shandong and Guangxi
are only influenced by secondary epicenters, whereas regions such as Sichuan evidence disease
transmission originating from both the primary epicenter and the secondary epicenters.

Notes: Regions are located geographically. The arrow indicates the direction of transmission, the lines display
external transmissions that are greater than two. The line widths are proportional to the external transmission in
the indicated direction and the size of the nodes are proportional to the total export from a region.

Conclusion

We analyze the propagation of COVID-19 among 33 provinces and special administrative regions
in China. We develop a spatial model to estimate the transmission network and evaluate the
effect of the policy interventions of lockdown and mobility restrictions on the disease spread. Our
empirical results suggest that secondary epicenters developed at a very early stage of the epidemic
and that mobility restriction across provinces prevented further spread of the disease. Thus, the
observed pandemic propagation in China could be re-contained to localized outbreaks. Community
transmission was observed to be the primary source of infection, and regional policy intervention
stemmed the spread of the disease. Our empirical findings suggest that the coordination of central
and local government policies is essential to suppress the spread of infectious diseases.
