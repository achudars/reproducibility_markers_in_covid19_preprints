Abstract
We propose a new method to estimate the time-varying effective (or instantaneous) reproduction number of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The method is based on a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental
model that describes the virus transmission. A two-stage estimation method,
which combines the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate reported state
variables (active and removed cases) and a low pass filter based on a rational
transfer function to remove short term fluctuations of the reported cases, is used
with case uncertainties that are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Our
method does not require information regarding serial intervals, which makes
the estimation procedure simpler without reducing the quality of the estimate.
We show that the proposed method is comparable to common approaches, e.g.,
age-structured and new cases based sequential Bayesian models. We also apply
it to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Sweden, and
Norway, where we see a delay of about four days in predicting the epidemic
peak.
Keywords: COVID-19, estimation theory, reproduction number.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), i.e., a disease outbreak of atypical
pneumonia that originated from Wuhan, China [1], has caused globally at least 6
million confirmed cases, including an estimated 370,000 deaths in approximately
200 countries by the end of May 2020 [2]. The World Health Organization
declared the COVID-19 crisis a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [3].

In modelling the disease’s transmission as well as to inform and evaluate control policies, it is particularly important to estimate its reproduction number.
Early estimates for COVID-19 basic reproduction number R0 , that denotes the
transmission potential of infectious disease when introduced to a completely susceptible population, ranged from 1.4 to 6.49 [4]. The effective (or instantaneous)
reproduction number Rt , on the other hand, reflects the extent of transmission
in the presence of population immunity or intervention. Thus, the estimation
of Rt is important for evaluating public measure success.
However, estimation of Rt is sensitive to the model structure and parameter
assumptions [5]. As a case in point, due to incorporation of more individual case
information and travel data, the estimate for R0 in Wuhan was revised upward
from 2.2-2.7 to 5.7 [6]. On the other hand, data inavailability or poor quality
often hinders the use of certain estimation methods, such as serial interval data
that are usually needed to estimate Rt (e.g., Fraser [7], Wallinga and Teunis
[8], Cauchemez et al. [9], White and Pagano [10]).
In the course of calculating the exact value of Rt , especially when the data
has not yet reached its peak, precise assumptions and data estimates are needed.
Nishiura et al. [11] discussed a likelihood-based approach to estimate Rt from
early epidemic growth data. Using the compartmental Susceptible-InfectiousRecovered (SIR) model, Bettencourt and Ribeiro [12] use the incidence data
to estimate R0 and Rt . In this paper, based on the Susceptible-InfectiousRecovered-Dead (SIRD) model as a reference, we develop a novel approach to
estimate Rt of COVID-19. It uses information on the number of infected or
active (I), recovered (R), and death (D) cases, which are readily available for
all affected countries [13], so that they can be accessed rather easily.
The reproduction number is estimated from reported cases under uncertainties using a two-stage estimation method based on the Extended Kalman Filter
(EKF) and a low-pass filter. The method not only considers the nominal number of reported cases, but also its daily pattern. To show our method’s practical
ability, we apply it to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian countries, i.e., Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and compare the results with two commonly used
Bayesian methods due to Bettencourt and Ribeiro [12] and Cori et al. [7, 14].
We show that the results are indeed comparable.
Our paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the mathematical
model that will base the method. We then discuss the two-stage estimation
method in Section 3. In Section 4 we apply the method to estimate the effective
reproduction number of COVID-19 in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. We also
compare the results with R0 and Rt calculated using the methods of [12] and
[14], respectively. We conclude our work in Section 5.

2. A Discrete-Time Stochastic Augmented Compartmental Model
Our estimation method is based on the compartmental SIRD model that
can be written as the following first-order nonlinear differential equations

βI(t)S(t)
=
− (γ + κ)I(t)

where S denotes the number of susceptible individuals, N is the total population,
β is the average number of contacts per person per time, γ and κ are the recovery
and death rate, respectively. Remark that the value of β is time-varying due
to intervention, i.e., β=β(t). To use the model, we require information on the
average infectious time Ti and the case fatality rate CFR, so that
γ=

(5)

For COVID-19, we take Ti = 9 as the infectious period on average lasts for 9
days (i.e., 7-11 days with 95% CI) [16]. CFR are taken based on the information
from [13]. The time-varying effective reproduction number is then given by


β(t)
S(t) β(t)
≈
Rt (t) =

(6)
N

γ+κ
The approximation is under the assumption that government intervention is
taken at an early stage so that the susceptible is relatively the same over time
as the total population. This is the case especially for emerging diseases. We
modify the SIRD model by augmenting the following two equations into the
system:
˙
DR(t)

= (γ + κ)I(t) − DR(t),

Ṙt (t) = 0.

(7)

The former equation takes into account the daily number of reported new cases
DR [17], while the latter one says that the effective reproduction number Rt
is assumed to be a piece-wise constant function with jump every one day time
interval.
Discretizing the model using the forward Euler method, we obtain the fol-

Our method computes a new estimate of Rt based on new reported cases. Since
their frequency is low (could be once a day), the reported data can be interpolated using, e.g., a modified Akima cubic Hermite interpolation, such that it fits
with the time step ∆t. In our simulation, the time step ∆t is chosen as 0.01,
i.e., 100 time discretization within one day interval. The confidence interval
of our estimated Rt is determined by computing the reproduction number for
different values of the infectious period Ti within a certain interval.
To simplify the presentation, we define the augmented state vector


S(k + 1)
 I(k + 1) 


 R(k + 1) 

x(k + 1) = 

 D(k + 1) 


DR(k + 1)
Rt (k + 1),

and as such, the discrete-time augmented SIRD model (8)-(13) can be written
as follows
x(k + 1) =

f (x(k)) + w(k),

(15)

where f is the nonlinear term written in the right hand side of (8)-(13) and w
is introduced as an uncertainty to model the inaccuracies due to simplification
in the modelling. The uncertainty is assumed to be a zero mean Gaussian white
noise with known covariance QF . In practice, QF can be considered as a tuning
parameter for the EKF. Thus, the transmission model becomes a discrete-time
stochastic augmented SIRD model.
Reported cases, such as the number of active cases and the cumulative numbers of recovered and death, can be incorporated into the model using the
following output vector
y(k + 1) =

Cx(k) + v(k).

(16)

Here, v denotes uncertainties due to false testing results. We also assume the
uncertainty to be a zero mean Gaussian white noise with known covariance RF .
As well as QF , RF can also be considered as a tuning parameter. Following the

3. A Two-Stage Filtering Method
A two-stage filtering method is used to estimate the daily reproduction number Rt . The method consists of the EKF and a low-pass filter. In the first stage
of estimation, the EKF is used to estimate the state variables and the value of
Rt under uncertainties in the number of reported cases. Afterwards, the low
pass filter is used to remove short term fluctuations of the reported cases that
can be caused by delays in the reporting. For example, suddenly in Denmark
there were 893 recovered patients reported on 1 April 2020, in contrast to the
previous days from 16 February 2020 onwards when there was no recovery reported at all. Such an accumulated delay can cause a falsely decreasing value
of Rt .
The EKF is an extension of Kalman filter for nonlinear systems. The Kalman
filter itself is based on a recursive Bayesian estimation and is an optimal linear
filter. The idea of EKF is to linearize the non-linearity around its estimate.
Due to that linearization, the optimality and stability of the EKF cannot be
guaranteed. However, if the non-linearity is not severe, the EKF can give a
reasonably good estimate.
Let us denote x̂(k) as an estimated vector state from the EKF. Applying
first-order Taylor series expansion to f at x̂(k), we obtain
f (x(k)) = f (x̂(k)) + Jf (x̂(k))(x(k) − x̂(k)),
where Jf (x̂(k)) is the Jacobian matrix of f ,

The EKF consists of two steps: predict and update. The discrete-time
stochastic augmented SIRD model is used to predict the next state and covariance and update them after obtaining new data/measurement. The EKF can
be considered as one of the simplest dynamic Bayesian networks. While the
EKF calculates estimates of the true values of states recursively over time using
incoming measurements and a mathematical process model, recursive Bayesian
estimation calculates estimates of an unknown probability density function recursively over time using incoming measurements and a mathematical process
model [18]. Let x̂(n|m) denotes the estimate of x at time n given observations
up to and including at time m ≤ n. The Kalman filter algorithm is given as
follows [19]
Predict
x̂(k + 1|k) =

f (x̂(k|k))

(26)

P (k + 1|k) =

Jf (x̂(k|k))P (k|k)Jf (x̂(k|k)) + QF (k)

(27)

⊺

Update
ỹ(k + 1) = y(k + 1) − C x̂(k + 1|k)

(28)

K(k + 1) = P (k + 1|k)C (CP (k + 1|k)C + RF (k))
⊺

⊺

−1

x̂(k + 1|k + 1) = x̂(k + 1|k) + K(k + 1)ỹ(k + 1)
P (k + 1|k + 1) = (I − K(k + 1)C) P (k + 1|k)

(29)
(30)
(31)

Here P (k|k) denotes a posteriori estimate covariance matrix. In the second
stage, a low pass filter based on a rational transfer function is used to remove
short term fluctuation at time step k, and is given by
ŷ(k) =

1
(x̂(k) + x̂(k) + · · · + x̂(k − yn + 1))
yn

where yn is a window length along the data. In our case, we choose yn =

∆t .

To evaluate the quality of the estimate, we calculate Relative Root Mean
Square Error (RRMSE) between the estimated and reported cases. The RRMSE
is defined as
!2
Nd
1 X
Xi − X̂i
RRMSE =
(33)

where Nd is the number of observed days and X ∈ {I, D, R, DR}.
4. Case study: Scandinavian countries
In this section, we apply our method to study viral transmission of COVID19 in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. All datasets and MATLAB code are available on GitHub (https://github.com/agusisma/covid19). As the country of
residence of the corresponding author, Denmark has a high estimated percentage of reported symptomatic COVID-19 cases, i.e., 61% (42%-87% of 95% CI)
[20]. Norway is at 73% with 43%-98% of 95% CI [20]. On the contrary, Sweden
only has 15% (11%-19% of 95% CI) [20]. The countries also have a different
approach in their public measures in responding to COVID-19, i.e., Sweden did
not implement a strict lockdown, unlike its Nordic neighbouring countries.
We plot the observed incidence of COVID-19 in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway in Fig. 1. We also plot in the same figure estimated numbers computed
using our method, where good agreement is obtained. For all estimation, the
process and observation covariance matrices are considered as tuning parameters
and are chosen as QF = diag(10 10 10 10 5 0.2) and RF = diag(100 10 10 5 1),
respectively. These parameters are chosen such that the RRMSE between the estimated and reported data are sufficiently small. In our case study, the RRMSE
are shown in Table 1.

In applying our method, we also compare it with two commonly used methods to estimate transmission parameters, namely the sequential Bayesian method
of Bettencourt and Ribeiro [12] that provides an approximation of the basic
reproduction number, and the instantaneous method by Fraser [7] that is implemented with a Bayesian analysis [15, 14]. The former method exploits the
new reported incidence, while the latter one uses the distribution of the serial
interval.
First, we compare our method with that of Bettencourt and Ribeiro [12],
that allows sequential estimation of the basic reproduction number at the initial

stage, i.e., when the growth is still exponential. While the two methods are based
on the SIR model, Bettencourt and Ribeiro [12] rather use new incidence data,
which in here need to be smoothed out using a five-day moving average filter. In
Fig. 2, we plot the comparison and summarise the basic reproduction numbers
that are taken to be the maximum of the curves in Table 2. It is interesting to
note how the methods give rather similar estimations. This indicates that our
method gives comparable results to those of [12].
Finally, we plot the time-varying effective reproduction number in Fig. 3.
Here, we compare our results with those using Cori et al. [14]. The method
of [14] utilises the disease serial interval, which we approximate using a shifted
Gamma distribution [14] with mean 4.7 and standard deviation 2.9 [21]. The
prior belief for the value of Rt is taken to be Gamma function with mean and
standard deviation 5. We do not average out the data of daily new cases, but
instead take the likelihood estimation of a new case at one day to depend also
on the estimation of the previous three days.

In Fig. 3 we obtain that the two methods give the plot of Rt with the same
trend, indicating that our method is also comparable with [14]. There is a delay
of about four days in the trend, especially with the time when the reproduction
number curve crossed the horizontal axis. The delay is caused by the peaks of
new daily cases and active ones that also differ by about the same days.
A different trend especially at later times between the methods appears in
Fig. 3(c) for Norway. The curve from our method is quite smooth, while it is
rather fluctuating in that using Cori et al. [14]. The discrepancy is caused by
the active and recovered cases that apparently were not updated regularly, in
contrast to the new positive cases needed by the method of [14]. The unreported
recovery cases were all released at once on May 22, 2020, see Fig. 1(c).
5. Conclusions and Future Work
Many mathematical models have been developed to estimate several types
of reproduction numbers during epidemic outbreaks. We here provide a novel
method exploiting reported active, recovered and death cases using the SIR
model as an underlying approach. This new method offers several advantages,
from the modeling point of view, the resulting Rt value can follow the dynamics
of the model suggested, so it is possible to develop it further if the model chosen
has a higher complexity, besides that the estimation approach used can still
be expanded in terms of statistical view. In the case that the data provided
in time series do not change much or instead have drastic changes, such as
accumulating at a certain time, the resulting Rt value will show the same spikes
and serrations. As a result, the latest information from data dynamics can be
more elaborated.

By applying the method to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian countries
and comparing the results to commonly used methods due to [12] and [14],
we showed that our model is comparable, which expectedly will allow for fast
assessment of the reproduction number in new outbreaks.
Using the method to forecast and critically assess incidence data in countries
with high under-reporting, such as Indonesia, is addressed for future work.
