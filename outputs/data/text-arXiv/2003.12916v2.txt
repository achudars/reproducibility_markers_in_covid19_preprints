Abstract
Significant research has shown that UV-C exposure is an effective disinfectant for a range of
bacteria and viruses, including coronaviruses. As such, a UV-C treatment in combination with a
chemical wipe, such as EPA hydrogen peroxide, is a common cleaning protocol in a medical
setting, and such disinfection protocols have gained in importance during the current COVID-19
pandemic due to the need to reuse PPE. However, given the substantial increase in patient
volume, the quantity of materials requiring disinfection exceeds the UV-C equipment throughput
capabilities at many medical facilities. Therefore, there is a need for a UV-C disinfection system
that can be rapidly deployed. In response to this demand, we designed, constructed, and
validated a UV-C disinfection system from readily accessible components; specifically, a plastic
bin, UV-C light bulb and conventional light housing. To further improve the performance, the
interior of the tub was spray-painted with chrome paint, forming a low quality-factor (Q) fabryperot optical cavity. As part of this work, a set of modular design criteria which allows for
flexibility in component selection without degradation of UV-C dose performance is established.
This flexibility is critical given the current fluctuating availability of source materials. The
disinfection capabilities of the system are validated using Bacillus cereus, a gram-positive
endospore-forming bacteria.

Introduction
Highly infectious microbial and viral diseases are a major challenge to global health, and, as
such, are also a significant risk to global financial stability and security. While vaccines play a
key role in preventing viral epidemics and pandemics, once an outbreak has occurred, the
implementation of disinfection measures to limit spread becomes paramount. As a result,
numerous methods of disinfection have been developed, including chemical (e.g. EPA hydrogen
peroxide), radiation (ozone, UV-C, microwave), and thermal.1–6 Among these different types,

UV-C disinfection has gained favor due to its efficacy against a broad range of microbial and
viral agents in a variety of environments.3,7,8
The UV-C wavelength band covers 100nm-280nm, and it directly overlaps with the peak
absorption of DNA and RNA (~260nm). The inactivation mechanism is straight-forward. Upon
UV-C absorption, the pyrimidines in the RNA or DNA are converted to pyrimidine (6–4)
pyrimidone photoproducts and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers.9 If the population of dimers is
sufficiently high, transcription errors occur, ultimately resulting in inactivation of the bacteria or
virus. As such, UV-C is a nearly universal disinfection method for bacteria, and its effectiveness
in viral disinfection is not correlated with virus size, but with pyrimidine concentration.
Previous works have shown 3 log inactivation using UV-C of a range of viruses including MMV,
PPV, PRV, BVDV, and H1N17–10. However, this previous work relied on large commercial
systems that can be challenging to procure, particularly in the midst of a pandemic or in a low
resource environment. Thus, given the universality of UV-C as a disinfection method, designing
and validating a system that can be constructed from easy to procure components has
significant societal impact.
In this work, we demonstrate a home-built UV-C disinfection system based on commonly
available components, including a plastic bin, UV-C light bulb, and standard light housing
(Figure 1). To improve the intensity of the UV-C light inside the box, a low-Q Fabry-Perot cavity
is formed by coating the box interior with a reflective coating using chrome spray paint. The
efficacy is validated using Bacillus cereus as a test organism. B. cereus is an aerobic, rodshaped, gram-positive bacteria that can quickly multiply at room temperature. It can cause
several illnesses primarily due to its production of several tissue-destructive exoenzymes. B.
cereus can form endospores that can withstand harsh conditions including UV exposure.11,12

Theory
The most important element of the system is optical power delivered by the UV-C source. As
simple guidelines, the dose delivered by the UV-C source is dependent on the distance the
object is away from the source (l), the source wattage and efficiency, and the exposure duration.
In other words, a lower wattage source can be used in place of a higher wattage source, if the
exposure duration is increased. Previous work has shown that UV-C doses in the 10mJ/cm2 are
capable of a 3 log reduction in bacteria growth8. In a virus sample, an order of magnitude higher
dose is typically required to achieve the same reduction.
Given that access to components may be highly variable, it is desirable to create a
generalizable expression governing the UV-C intensity and intensity distribution inside of the
UV-C system. This expression can then be used to calculate the impact of different bulbs on
UV-C dose, accelerating re-design when needed.

The UV-C bulb is treated like a linear light source, where each point on the bulb is a point light
source with isotropic radiation. The cumulative UV-C dose created by the bulb is an integration
of the dose generated by all the point light sources on the bulb.

Figure 2: Schematic showing key variables used to calculate cumulative UV-C dose.

As is shown in Figure 2, assuming we have an enclosure with length L, width W and height H.
The bulb is placed on the side wall above the floor of the box by a height of h, and it has an
optically active length of ℓ and is centered on the wall horizontally. Given this configuration, for

any point source on the bulb, the location of the point source is (𝑋𝑋, 𝑊𝑊, ℎ), where 𝑋𝑋 ∈ [
2
For any point (𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦, 𝑧𝑧) in the box, the distance between the point light source and the detection
point is:
𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 = �(𝑋𝑋 − 𝑥𝑥)2 + (𝑊𝑊 − 𝑦𝑦)2 + (ℎ − 𝑧𝑧)2
Assuming the UV-C wattage power of the bulb is 𝑃𝑃 (unit: Watt), then the power of the point
source is 𝑃𝑃/ℓ. As the point source radiates isotropically in a sphere, the radiation intensity on
point (𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦, 𝑧𝑧) would be:

4𝜋𝜋 ((𝑋𝑋 −

𝑥𝑥)2

𝑃𝑃/ℓ
+ (𝑊𝑊 − 𝑦𝑦)2 + (ℎ − 𝑧𝑧)2 )

By integrating all the point sources on the bulb, we get the intensity generated by the whole
bulb:

The intensity calculated above is for the situation where there is no reflection from the box.
However, in the system developed in the present work, the interior is coated with a reflective
chrome paint. To simplify the reflection calculation, we only take the first order of reflection into
consideration. In other words, the reflection of the reflected light is not considered. The initial
calculation of intensity generated by the reflection is similar to the previous one with a slight
modification. To account for the reflection, a series of “virtual light bulbs” with a power of 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼,
where 𝛼𝛼 is the reflection rate, are located on the walls counter to the primary light source. The
intensity generated by each mirrored bulb can also be calculated using the integration method.
The only difference is that the distance between point (𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦, 𝑧𝑧) and the mirrored bulb is different
from the previous calculation. By adding the reflection caused by all the walls (including ceiling
and floor) together, we get the intensity of the UV-C light inside the box. The intensity can be
expressed in the following equation:

In the system shown in Figure 1, L = 78.74 cm, W = 50.8 cm, H = 35.56 cm, h = 25.4 cm, and ℓ
= 43.18 cm. The wattage of the UV-C light bulb is 15 W, and, considering a 35% conversion
efficiency, the UV-C wattage 𝑃𝑃 = 5.25 W. By putting all these parameters into the equation, we
can calculate the intensity at any point in the box (unit: W/cm2). To determine the UV-C dose,
this value should be multiplied by the time that the system is on.
Figure 3 shows a series of calculations for an exposure time of 3 minutes. The wall reflectivity is
varied between 0% and 50%. While the system is able to exceed the 10mJ/cm2 target dose with
the 3 minute exposure throughout the box in all three systems, with a 50% reflectivity, the dose
delivered is several orders of magnitude higher. This increase would allow for a substantial
decrease in exposure duration, accelerating throughput of the system.

system. Three different wall reflectivity values are modeled: (a) 0%, (b) 25%, and 50%.

Results
As can be seen in Figure 4, the B. cereus samples that were not exposed to UV-C readily
formed colonies after 24 hour incubation time indicating that all preparation methods were
correct. The baseline counts of Petri dish organism films ranged from 1 to 3 x 106 colony forming
units (CFU). In contrast, this growth was dramatically eliminated when the samples were
exposed to the UV-C, even with only 1 minute exposure (Figure 4, inset).
At 1 minute UV-C exposure, all organism counts were nil except for one of three replicates in
which 800 CFU remained. At 3 and 6 minute UV-C exposure times, organism counts were
reduced to undetectable levels except for one of three replicates in which 100 CFU remained.
Directly irradiated organisms on blood agar plates demonstrated no growth of organisms at 3
and 6 minute exposure times but growth of 700 CFU/mL after 1 minute exposure, whereas
baseline count was >3 x 105 CFU/mL (Figure 4).

Figure 4: Summary of results. (a) In both control samples, over 106 colony forming units (CFUs) grew
during the 24 hour incubation period. In contrast, the majority of the exposed dishes were unable to
support colony formation, indicating a 6 log reduction. (b) Control sample of B. cereus not exposed to UVC formed colonies after 24 hour incubation time. (c) In contrast, this growth was dramatically eliminated
after 1 minute exposure of identical sample preparations to the UV-C.

In addition to achieving >3 log reduction, the exposure times compare favorably to commercial
UV-C disinfection systems which typically have disinfection protocols between 1-2 minutes. The
alignment between the current build-at-home approach and the conventional commercial
systems is possible because the cumulative dose delivered is the same, as shown in Figure 3.
However, the proposed system offers numerous advantages. Specifically, the design can be
adapted to use any UV-C bulb length, it is portable and significantly lighter, and it is less
expensive.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed and validated a simple to construct UV-C disinfection system.
It uses readily available, inexpensive components to create the UV-C chamber. The efficiency of
the system is further improved by turning the chamber into a low-Q Fabry-Perot cavity by
coating the interior with a reflective material. As a result, the intensity of the UV-C optical field is
amplified, allowing shorter exposure times to be used. Over 3 log reduction in CFUs is
confirmed using B. cereus as a model bacteria. This approach will find use during the current
COVID-19 pandemic where PPE is in short supply as well as in the future in low resource
environments.
Methods
Before presenting the methods, the authors would like to emphasize that exposure to UV-C has
been directly and indirectly linked to several diseases and life-threatening conditions. Therefore,
it is critically important to avoid indirect or direct exposure to the UV-C source.
Box fabrication: The interior of a 17 gallon plastic tote (Home Depot) was first cleaned with
Acetone and then coated with chrome spray-paint (Rustoleum, Bright coat Metallic Chrome,
Home Depot). The UV-C source was an 18” Philips UV-C bulb (G-15T8, 15W, McMaster). Two
holes were drilled in the side of the tote to mount an under-counter light fixture (Home Depot)
which held the UV-C source. Power was supplied to the light fixture via a power cord which was
run through a third hole, located in the corner. To control the light externally, the power cord was
plugged into a power strip with an on/off switch.

Bacteria growth/sample preparation protocol: A B. cereus isolate previously isolated from
routine clinical culture was selected for this study. After subculture on sheep blood agar and
overnight incubation at 35°C, a 4.0 McFarland suspension was prepared in sterile 0.45% saline
solution. For analysis of UV-C irradiation of plastic surface, 100 µL aliquots were dispensed onto
sterile polystyrene Petri dishes (100 mm diameter) over an approximately 1 x 2 cm area, then
allowed to completely dry at 35°C, up to 30 minutes. Three replicates were included for each
exposure time. For analysis of direct irradiation of agar media, sheep blood agar plates were
inoculated with 1 µL and 10 µL of the 4.0 McF suspension prior to UV-C exposure. Baseline
counts were obtained for each experiment and prepared in the same manner as experimental
samples.
Directly after UV-C exposure of organism films on Petri dishes, each dish was flooded with 10
mL of 0.45% saline and scraped to completely resuspend the film. For baseline counts, 100 µL
of 1:100 and 1:10,000 dilutions were plated in duplicate. For UV-C irradiated organism counts,
100 µL of neat, 1:100, and 1:10,000 dilutions of each sample were plated in duplicate.
Organism counts were performed after 24 hr incubation of culture plates at 35°C in 5% CO .
