Twitter discussions and emotions about COVID-19 pandemic: a machine learning
approach
Abstract
Background: Public response to the COVID-19 pandemic is important to be measured. Twitter
data are an important source for the infodemiology study of public response monitoring.
Objective: The objective of the study is to examine coronavirus disease (COVID-19) related
discussions, concerns, and sentiments that emerged from tweets posted by Twitter users.
Methods: We analyze 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a
list of 25 hashtags such as "coronavirus," "COVID-19," "quarantine" from March 1 to April 21
in 2020. We use a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify
popular unigram, bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected Tweets.
Results: Popular unigrams include "virus," "lockdown," and "quarantine." Popular bigrams
include "COVID-19," "stay home," "corona virus," "social distancing," and "new cases." We
identify 13 discussion topics and categorize them into five different themes, such as "public health
measures to slow the spread of COVID-19," “social stigma associated with COVID-19,”
“coronavirus news cases and deaths,” “COVID-19 in the United States,” and “coronavirus cases
in the rest of the world. Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of
coronavirus are anticipation that measures that can be taken, followed by a mixed feeling of trust,
anger, and fear for different topics. The public reveals a significant feeling of fear when they
discuss the coronavirus new cases and deaths than other topics.
Conclusion: The study shows that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged
for infodemiology study by studying the evolving public discussions and sentiments during the
COVID-19. As the situation evolves rapidly, several topics are consistently dominant on Twitter,

such as “the confirmed cases and death rates,” “preventive measures,” “health authorities and
government policies,” “COVID-19 stigma,” and “negative psychological reactions (e.g., fear).”
death. Real-time monitoring and assessment of the Twitter discussion and concerns can be
promising for public health emergency responses and planning. Already emerged pandemic fear,
stigma, and mental health concerns may continue to influence public trust when there occurs a
second wave of COVID-19 or a new surge of the imminent pandemic.

Introduction
Eight million people have been confirmed positive of COVID-19 across 110 countries as of midJune 2020, and the death toll has reached close to 435,000 [1]. The widespread utilization of social
media, such as Twitter, accelerates the process of exchanging information and expressing opinions
about public events and health crises [2-5]. COVID-19 is one of the trending topics on Twitter
since January 2020 and has continued to be discussed to date. Since quarantine measures have
been implemented across most countries (e.g., the Shelter-in-Place order in the United States),
people have been increasingly relying on different social media platforms to receive news and
express opinions. Twitter data are valuable in revealing public discussions and sentiments to
interesting topics, and real-time news updates in global pandemics, such as H1N1 and Ebola [69]. Chew and Eysenbach’s study shows that Twitter can be used for real-time “infodemiology”
studies, a source of opinions for health authorities to respond to public concerns [6]. In the current
COVID-19 pandemic, many government officials worldwide are using Twitter, as one of the main
communication channels, to regularly share policy updates and news related to COVID-19 to the
general public [10].
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, a growing number of studies have collected Twitter data to
understand the public responses to, and discussions around COVID-19 [11-16]. For instance, AbdAlrazaq and colleagues adopt topic modeling and sentiment analysis to understand main discussion
themes and sentiments around COVID-19, using Tweets collected between February 2 and March
15, 2020 [11]. Budhwani and Sun compare Tweets discussions before and after March 16, 2020,
when President Trump tweeted the “Chinese virus,” and find a significant increase use of “Chinese
virus” in people’s Tweets across many states in the United States [14]. Mackey and colleagues
analyze about 3,465 tweets collected between March 2 and 20, 2020, using a topic model to explore
users’ self-reported experiences with COVID-19 and related symptoms [16]. Ahmed and

colleagues conduct social network analysis and content analysis of the collected Tweets between
March 27 and April 4, 2020, to understand what may have driven the misinformation that linked
5G towers in the United Kingdom to the COVID-19 pandemic [12]. As conversations on Twitter
continue to take place and evolve, it is worth continuing to use tweets as a source of data to track
and understand what the salient topics discussed on Twitter in response to the COVID-19
pandemic and track their changes in different time periods are.
To expand the literature on public reactions to the COVID-19, the present study aims to examine
the public discourses and emotions about the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing more than 4
million Tweets collected between March 7 and April 21, 2020.

Methods
Research design
We used a purposive sampling approach to collect COVID-19 related Tweets published between
March 7 and April 21, 2020. Our Twitter data mining approach followed the pipeline displayed in
Figure 1. Data preparation included three steps (1) sampling, (2) data collection, and (3) preprocessing the raw data. The data analysis stage included unsupervised machine learning,
sentiment analysis, and qualitative method. The unit of analysis was each message-level tweet.
Unsupervised learning is one approach in machine learning, and used to examine data for patterns,
and derives a probabilistic clustering based on the text data. We chose unsupervised learning
because it is commonly used when existing studies have little observations or insights of the
unstructured text data [17]. Since a qualitative approach has challenges analyzing large-scale
Twitter data, unsupervised learning allows us to conduct exploratory analyses of large text data in
social science research. In the present study, we first employed an unsupervised machine learning
approach to identify salient latent topics. Using the topics, we used a qualitative approach to

develop themes further, as a qualitative approach allows a deeper dive into the data, such as
through manual coding and inductively developing themes based on the latent topics generated by
machine learning algorithms.
Figure 1. Twitter data mining pipeline

Sampling and Data collection
We used a list of COVID-19 related hashtags as search terms to fetch Tweets, such as
“#coronavirus,” “#2019nCoV,” “#COVID19,” “#coronaoutbreak,” and “#quarantine,” (Appendix
1). Twitter’s open application programming interface (API) allowed us to collect updated Twitter
messages that are set open by default. From March 7 to April 21, 2020, we collected about 35
million (n=35,204,604) Tweets during this period, shown Figure 2. After removing non-English
Tweets, 23 million (n=23,817,948) Tweets remained. After removing the duplicates and Retweets
(i.e., only reposts the original message without adding any more words), we have more than 4
million (n=4,196,020) Tweets in our final dataset. We collected and downloaded the following
features for each Tweet, including (1) Tweet full text, (2) the numbers of favorites, followers, and
friends, (3) user' geolocation; and (4) user' description/self-created profile.

Figure 2. Tweets pre-processing chart

Pre-processing the raw data
Shown in Figure 1, we used Python to clean the raw data. The process was as follows [18],
(1) We removed the hashtag symbol, @users, and URLs from the Tweets in the dataset.
(2) We removed non-English characters (non-ASCII characters) because the present study
focuses on Tweets in English.
(3) We removed special characters, punctuations, and stop-words listed in [19] from the
dataset as they do not contribute to the semantic meanings of the messages.
Data analysis
Unsupervised machine learning
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [20] is one of the widely used unsupervised machine learning
approaches allowing researchers to analyze unstructured text data (e.g., Twitter messages). Based

on the data itself, the algorithm produces frequently mentioned pairs of words, the pairs of words
co-occur together, and the latent topics and their distributions over topics in the document [21].
Existing studies have indicated the feasibility of using LDA in identifying the patterns and themes
of the Tweets texts related to COVID-19 [11 22].
Qualitative analysis
To triangulate and contextualize findings from the LDA model, we employed a qualitative
approach to develop themes further. Specifically, using Braun and Clarke's [23] six steps of
thematic analysis: (1) getting familiar with the keyword data, (2) generating initial codes, (3)
searching for themes, (4) reviewing potential themes, (5) defining themes, and (6) reporting. Since
the thematic approach relies on human interpretation, a process that can be significantly influenced
by the personal understanding of the topics and a variety of bias, we had two team members
conduct the first five steps independently. Then, the two members reviewed all identified themes
and resolved disagreements together. Finally, we finalized themes corresponding to each one of
the 13 topics.
Sentiment analysis
We used sentiment analysis, a natural language processing (NLP) approach, to classify the main
sentiments of a given twitter message, such as fear and joy [24]. In the study, we used the NRC
Emotion Lexicon, which consisted of eight primary emotions: anger, anticipation, fear, surprise,
sadness, joy, disgust, and trust [25]. We followed the four steps to calculate the emotion index for
each twitter message, including (1) removing articles, pronouns (e.g., "and," "the," or "to"), (2)
applying a stemmer by removing the predefined list of prefixes and suffixes (e.g., “running” after
stemming becomes "run") [26], and (3) calculating the emotion index. We only kept one emotion

with the maximum matching counts if one sentence has multiple emotions; and (4) calculating the
scores for each eight-emotion type. We discussed the four steps in detail in the previous study [18].

Results
Descriptive results
A total of four million (n=4,196,020) Tweets consisted of our final dataset after pre-processing all
raw data. We identified the most popular tweeted bigrams (pairs of words) related to COVID-19.
Bigrams captured “two concessive words regardless of the grammar structure and semantic
meaning and may not be self-explanatory” [27], including “covid 19,” "stay home," "social
distancing," "new cases," "don't know," "confirmed cases," "home order," "New York," "tested
positive," "death toll," and "stay safe." Popular unigrams included virus, lockdown, quarantine,
people, new, home, like, stay, don't, and cases. We presented the most popular unigrams and
bigrams related to COVID-19 in Table 1 and visualized them using the word clouds in figure 3
and figure 4.

COVID-19 related topics
Our approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), produced frequently co-occurred pairs of words
related to COVID-19 and organized these co-occurring words into different topics. LDA allowed
researchers to manually define the number of topics (e.g., ten topics, twenty topics) that we would
like to generate. Consistent with the previous studies, we used the coherence model – gensim [28]
to calculate the most appropriate number of topics based on the specific data itself. For this dataset,
the number of topics (n=13) returned by LDA had the highest coherence score as well as the
smallest topic number. For example, the numbers of topics (n=19 or n=20) had higher coherence
scores than the number of topics (n=13), but they represented larger topic numbers, shown in
Figure 4.
Figure 5. The number of topics based on the coherence model

We further analyzed the document-term matrix and obtained the distributions of 13 topics with the
chosen thirteen topics. We presented the results of the identified 13 salient topics and the most
popular pairs of words within each topic in Table 2. For example, Topic 3 had the highest

distribution (8.87%) among all 13 common latent topics. The bigrams were associated with Topic
3, including “tested positive,” “coronavirus outbreak,” “New York,” “shelter place,” and “mental
health.” These pairs of words frequently co-occurred together, and therefore the LDA model
assigned them to the same topic.

Sentiment analysis of each latent topic
We presented the results of the sentiment analysis for each of the thirteen latent topics in Table 3.
We also ran a one-tailed z test to examine if each of the eight emotions is statistically significantly
different across topics. The p-value smaller than .01 was set as a threshold for significance. For
example, statistical significance for anticipation in Topic 2 indicated that it was very likely (p
< .001) that the anticipation emotion is more prevalently expressed in Topic 2 (21.7%) than all
other topics.

Figure 5 presented eight emotions of trust, anticipation, joy, surprise, anger, fear, disgust, and
sadness. Results showed that across all 13 topics, anticipation (dark blue line) dominated 12 topics,
and followed by fear (orange line), trust (grey line), and anger (yellow line). For example, about
23.8% of Tweets in Topic 8 revealed feelings of anticipation that “necessary steps and precautions
will be taken” [18 29]. The emotion fear for the impacts of the virus took 18.8% of the Tweets in
Topic 10, which was statistically different from the fear expressed in other topics.

Figure 6. Sentiment analysis for each of the 13 latent topics

COVID-19 related themes
The qualitative content analysis approach allowed users to categorize these topics into different
distinct themes. Two team members discussed these bigrams and generated Tweets samples in
each topic and then categorized the identified 13 topics into 5 different themes. To protect the
privacy and anonymity of the Twitter users, we did not present any user-related information, such
as users’ twitter handles or other identifying information; therefore, sample Tweets shown in Table
4 were excerpts drawn from original Tweets.

We organized thirteen topics into five themes, including “public health measures to slow the spread
of COVID-19 (e.g., facemasks, test kits, vaccine),” “social stigma associated with COVID-19 (e.g.,
Chinese virus, Wuhan virus),” “coronavirus news cases and deaths (e.g., new cases, deaths),”
“COVID-19 in the United States (e.g., New York, protests, task force),” and “coronavirus cases in
the rest of the world (e.g., UK, global issue).” For example, theme “public health measures to slow
the spread of COVID-19” included relevant topics of “facemasks,” “quarantine,” “test kits,”
“lockdown,” “safety,” “a need for the vaccine,” and “U.S.’s shelter-in-place.” In addition, “home
quarantine,” “self-quarantine” were two of the most commonly co-occurred words under topic
quarantine.

Discussion
Principal results
In this study, we address the problem of public discussions and emotions using COVID-19 related
messages on Twitter. Twitter users discuss five main themes related to COVID-19 Between March
7 to April 21, 2020. Topic modeling of the Tweets is effective in providing insights about
coronavirus topics and concerns on Twitter. The results show several essential points. First, the
public is using a variety of terms referring to COVID-19, including "virus," "COVID 19,"
"coronavirus," "corona virus." In addition, coronavirus has been referred to as the "China virus"
that can create stigma and harm efforts to address the COVID-19 outbreak [14]. Second,
discussions about the pandemic in New York are salient, and its associated public sentiments are
anger. Third, public discussions about the Chinese Communist Party (PPC) and the spread of the
virus emerge as a new topic, which is not identified in a previous study [18], suggesting the
connection between the COVID-19 and politics is increasing to be circulating on Twitter as the
situation evolves. Fourth, public sentiment on the spread of coronavirus is anticipation for the

20

potential measures that can be taken and followed by a mixed feeling of trust, anger, and fear.
Results suggest that the public is not surprised by the rapid spread of growth. Fifth, the public
reveals a significant feeling of fear when they discuss the coronavirus crisis and deaths. Lastly,
results show that trust for the authorities no longer remain as a prominent emotion when Twitter
users discuss COVID-19, which is different than an early study [18] showing that people hold trust
for public health authorities based on a sample of Tweets posted from January 20 to March 7, 2020.
Comparison with prior work
Our findings are consistent with previous studies using social media data to assess the public health
response and sentiments for COVID-19, and suggest that public attention has been focusing on the
following topics since January 2020, including
(1) the confirmed cases and death rates [11, 18, 30];
(2) preventive measures [11, 18, 30];
(3) health authorities and government policies [10, 18];
(4) an outbreak in New York [18];
(5) COVID-19 stigma by referencing the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” [11, 14].
(6) negative psychological reactions (e.g., fear) or mental health consequences [11, 31, 32]

Compared with the study examining public discussions and concerns for COVID-19 using Twitter
data from January 20 to March 7, 2020, we find that several salient topics are no longer popular,
including (1) Outbreak in South Korea; (2) Diamond princess cruise; (3) economic impact [11 33];
and (4) supply chains [18]. Given the preventive measures, washing hands is no longer a prevalent
topic. Instead, quarantine has become dominant.

21

In addition, our study identifies new discussion topics around the COVID-19 between March 7 to
April 21, such as (1) a need for a vaccine to stop the spread; (2) quarantine and shelter-in-place
order; (3) pretests against the lockdown; (4) coronavirus pandemic in the United States. The new
salient topics suggest that Twitter users (English) are focusing their attention to the COVID-19 in
the United States (e.g., New York, protests, task force, millions of confirmed cases) rather than
discussions about global news contents (South Korea, Diamond princess cruise, Dr. Li Wenliang
in China).

Limitations
First, we only sample a trending of 20 hashtags as the key search terms to collect Twitter data
(Appendix 1). New hashtags keep coming up as the situation evolves. For example, a hashtag may
become widely used after a related topic becomes more popular, such as the official name,
COVID-19, for the virus. Second, Twitter users are not representative of the whole population
globally, and topics of Tweets only indicate online users' opinions about and reactions to COVID19. However, the Twitter dataset is still a valuable source allowing us to examine real-time Twitter
users’ responses and online activities related to COVID-19. Third, non-English Tweets are
removed from our analyses, and hence the results are limited to users who posted in English only.
Future studies are recommended to include other languages, such as Italian, French, Germany, and
Spanish, for COVID-19 analyses.

Future research
First, future research could further explore public trust and confidence in existing measures and
policies, which is essential. Compared to prior work, our study shows that Twitter users reveal a
feeling of joy when talking about “herd immunity.” We also find sentiments of fear and
anticipation related to topics of quarantine and shelter-in-place. In addition, future studies could

22

evaluate how government officials (e.g., President Trump) and international organizations (e.g.,
WHO) deliver and convey messages to the public, and its impact on the public opinions and
sentiments. Third, future studies could examine the spread of anti-Chinese/Asian sentiments social
media and how people use social media platforms to resist and challenge COVID-19 stigma.
Fourth, our findings do not show that misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic is a
prominent theme. An existing study shows that 25% (n=153) of sampled Tweets contained
misinformation [35]. They also find that the term “COVID-19” has lower rates of misinformation
than that associated with the terms of “#2019_ncov” and “Corona.” Future research is suggested
in the investigation of misinformation and how it expands on social media. Finally, the study finds
that trust is no longer prominent when people tweet about confirmed cases and deaths. Instead,
fear has replaced trust to be the dominant emotion. Future research is suggested to examine the
changes in trust over time.

Conclusions
The study shows that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for
infodemiology study by studying the evolving public discussions and sentiments during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings facilitate an understanding of public discussions and concerns
about COVID-19 pandemic among Twitter users between March 7 and April 21, 2020. Several
topics were consistently dominant on Twitter, such as “the confirmed cases and death rates,”
“preventive measures,” “health authorities and government policies,” “COVID-19 stigma,” and
“negative psychological reactions (e.g., fear).” As the situation evolves rapidly, new salient topics
emerge accordingly. Anticipation for the potential measures that can be taken to stop the spread of
COVID-19 is still significantly prevalent across all topics. However, Twitter users reveal fear

23

when tweeting about COVID-19 new cases or death rather than trust [18]. Real-time monitoring
and assessment of the Twitter discussion and concerns can be promising for public health
emergency responses and planning. Hearing and reacting to real concerns from the public can
enhance trust between the healthcare systems and the public as well as prepare for a future public
health emergency.
