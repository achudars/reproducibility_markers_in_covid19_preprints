This paper investigates the relationship between the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic,
the state of community activity, and the financial index performance across 20 countries.
First, we analyze which countries behaved similarly in 2020 with respect to one of three
multivariate time series: daily COVID-19 cases, Apple mobility data and national equity
index price. Next, we study the trajectories of all three of these attributes in conjunction
to determine which exhibited greater similarity. Finally, we investigate whether country
financial indices or mobility data responded quicker to surges in COVID-19 cases. Our
results indicate that mobility data and national financial indices exhibited the most similarity
in their trajectories, with financial indices responding quicker. This suggests that financial
market participants may have interpreted and responded to COVID-19 data more efficiently
than governments. Further, results imply that efforts to study community mobility data as a
leading indicator for financial market performance during the pandemic were misguided.

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
COVID-19 has resulted in a global pandemic with severe human, social and financial costs.
To mitigate the spread of new cases, governments have implemented a multi-level approach
involving social distancing, business closures and movement restrictions. Given the ubiquity
of mobile devices, the effects of such restrictions on community activity and movement may
be observed through Apple mobility data.1 This mobility data provides a timely representative of the current state of community movement and activity, with some limitations. In
addition, it has been hypothesized that these restrictions would have a deleterious effect on
the global financial system.2 This raises the question: did financial markets or community
mobility, as an approximate representative of the current level of government restrictions,
exhibit an earlier crash in March 2020? This may suggest whether market participants or
governments responded more quickly to the pandemic. This paper addresses this by analyzing COVID-19 cases, community mobility data and financial markets in conjunction and
on a country-by-country basis. We observe substantial similarity between countries’ mobility and financial trajectories as a whole, and determine that markets generally reflected the
pandemic more promptly than community mobility.

I.

INTRODUCTION
Throughout the pandemic, there has been extensive debate on the merits and necessity of

measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Policymakers have had to balance the ramifications
of business closures, movement restrictions and lockdowns against prioritizing public health. To
inform the decision-making process, there has been consistent interest in studying the impact
of COVID-19 cases and deaths on various measures of community and financial activity in any
candidate country. While COVID-19 counts and financial data are typically available on a daily
basis, traditional economic metrics such as unemployment and GDP, which may measure whether a
community is thriving or in decline, are generally only available on a monthly or quarterly basis.
Both financial markets and new waves of the pandemic may change at a much greater rate than
updates to these data may be available.
For a more granular and up-to-date analysis during the pandemic, many investors have used
alternative data sources as an indicator of the community’s activity and normalcy in various
countries.3 We follow this trend, using daily Apple mobility data as an indicator of such activity. On
2

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
a country-by-country basis, this mobility data reports various community movement indicators such
as walking, driving and public transport. As varying indicators are available in different locations,
we average the indicators of any candidate country to form a single mobility time series for each
country. We provide a more detailed description of the data in Section II.
This paper is inspired by the substantial heterogeneity that countries across the world experienced
in 2020 with respect to their COVID-19 cases and deaths, government responses, community
activity, and financial market performance. Government restrictions on movement, businesses
and community activity varied substantially, both from country to country and over time. Some
countries acted more aggressively in closing borders4 and implementing contact tracing programs,5
while other nations and states did not implement sufficient restrictions or implemented them too
late.6,7 These varied responses led to substantial differences in case and death counts,8 community
activity during lockdowns and reopening,9,10 and financial market performance throughout 2020.11
Amid this heterogeneity, studying the relationship between cases, community activity and
market performance on a country-by-country basis and over time may reveal some key relationships
between community and market activity during the pandemic. First, we aim to understand which
countries behaved most similarly with respect to each individual characteristic. Similarity as
well as differences between countries may provide the opportunity to learn from more successful
countries in the future and attribute better or worse outcomes to certain responses. Next, we wish
to understand which of the three data attributes behaved most similarly as a whole. This may
provide insights into which factors (epidemiological, behavioral, and financial) are likely leading
vs lagging. Finally, it is worth investigating whether governments or financial markets acted more
efficiently during the pandemic, and which governments acted most (and least) efficiently. We study
financial markets via country equity index prices, while government actions such as restrictions on
businesses and movements are related to community mobility data. Given the substantial variance
among government responses, one can highlight the most (and least) responsive governments.
There has been a litany of work examining the impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of
conventional financial markets.12–20 In addition to equities, significant research has addressed shifts
in cryptocurrency behavior during this period.21–29 The study of market crises, and in particular
the COVID-19 market crisis, has attracted significant interest from the nonlinear dynamics and
econophysics communities.30–34 Building upon prior studies of COVID-19 in general and analyses
of mobility data,35–37 we believe this is the first paper to simultaneously and quantitatively address
the heterogeneous evolution of community activity and financial markets among a wide collection
3

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
of countries, and examine the responsiveness of community mobility vs financial markets to
COVID-19.
For this purpose, we use new and existing methods to study COVID-19, mobility and financial
time series on a country-by-country basis. Within epidemiology, time series analysis has been
used to study a variety of diseases such as Ebola,38,39 Zika,40,41 and more recently, COVID-19.
Methods used by nonlinear dynamics researchers to study COVID-19 are numerous, including
innovations based on SIR models,42–50 power-law models,51–53 distance analysis,54,55 network
models,56–59 analyses of the dynamics of transmission and contact,60,61 forecasting models,62
Bayesian methods,63 clustering64,65 and many other works.66–70
This paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we describe the data sources used in this
paper and perform an initial analysis on the Apple mobility data. In Section III, we analyze
epidemiological, community mobility and financial data independently, identifying structural
similarity among the 20 countries under consideration with respect to each attribute. In Section IV,
we study all trajectories in conjunction to determine which data attributes display more homogeneity
as a whole. In Sections III and IV, we first use hierarchical clustering to gain insights into the
structure of the collection of time series, and then follow with a closer analysis of their dynamics,
using both new and existing methods. In Section V, we introduce a new approach to investigate
whether the impact of COVID-19 was felt by mobility or financial data first. This analyzes the extent
of coincidence of COVID-19 peaks and mobility and financial troughs among different countries,
and may suggest whether governments or financial markets were more efficient at responding
during the pandemic. We summarize our findings and limitations regarding COVID-19 cases,
community mobility and financial market performance in Section VI.

DATA
The countries included in this study are the following: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada,

Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
Russia, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the United States (U.S.).
Excluding China, where mobility data is not available, this list contains most of the top 20 economies
in the world by nominal GDP.71 For each country, we analyze three time series: COVID-19 new
cases, averaged Apple mobility data across available indicators, and country financial index price.
As financial data is only available on weekdays (and COVID-19 and mobility data are consistently
4

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
reduced on weekends), we restrict our analysis only to trading days. Our data spans 01/13/2020 to
12/30/2020, a period of 234 trading days.
Apple mobility data provides aggregated counts of requests for directions via Apple Maps for
various countries and regions. Although the data records requests, rather than distances actually
travelled, many analysts have used this data throughout the pandemic as a guide into people’s
movements.3 Apple mobility data is available across 63 countries, with the notable omission of
China. Each country has up to three indicators - walking, driving and transit - with available
indicators varying across countries. This may provide a challenge to fairly comparing different
countries’ mobility activity. In this section, we perform an initial analysis of the different constituent
indicators of each country’s mobility data. Our aim is to show high correlation between these
constituent indicators. Therefore, it is appropriate to average available indicators and yield one
representative mobility time series for each country. As each constituent indicator is highly
correlated, this averaged data represents each individual indicator well. One can then compare the
single averaged mobility time series on a country-by-country basis.
j

Each country (i = 1, ..., 20) has either two or three mobility indicators µi (t), j = 1, 2, 3. For
each country, we compute the average of the non-trivial correlations, namely

ρiav =

i

(1)

A value close to 1 indicates that all available indicators for that country are highly correlated. We
record these average correlations for each country in Table I. In addition, we display all correlations
between constituent indicators of any country in Figure 1. In Table I, we can see clearly that the
average correlations of mobility indicators for each country are overwhelmingly high, ranging from
0.59 to 0.99 and a median of 0.86. This is also reflected in the entries of Figure 1, where individual
correlation coefficients between mobility indicators of the same country are almost all close to 1.
This justifies our averaging approach, as the single averaged mobility time series for each country
represents every available indicator quite well. Henceforth in this paper, we will only examine
averaged mobility data in order to fairly compare country to country.
We conclude this section with a brief outline of possible bias in using the mobility data to
measure community activity. If the requests that the data counts were substantially different to

people’s actual movements, the data may not provide the optimal depiction of community mobility.
One instance of such potential bias could be people’s checking travel distances to restaurants, as
a means of estimating food delivery time; in such circumstances, people may not subsequently
proceed with any journey. Further interpretations and limitations of this data, including existing
research on the utility of mobility data, are discussed in Section VI.

COUNTRY SIMILARITY WITH RESPECT TO COVID-19, MOBILITY AND

FINANCIAL DATA
In this section, we study the behaviors of COVID-19 cases, community mobility activity and
financial index prices among our countries of interest. Our analysis uses data starting 01/13/2020 and
finishing 12/30/2020, a period of 234 trading days. Across n = 20 countries, let xi (t), µi (t), pi (t) be

the multivariate time series of each country’s new daily COVID-19 cases, averaged Apple mobility
data, and daily closing equity prices, t = 0, ..., T and i = 1, ..., n. T = 233 gives 234 trading days.

A.

Methodology and overview
First, we analyze countries’ COVID-19 cases relative to each other. Considering the new case

T1
counts of a single country gives a function xi ∈ RT +1 . Let ||xi || = ∑t=0
|xi (t)| be its L1 norm. We

can define a normalized case trajectory by fi =

xi
||xi || .

These vectors highlight the relative changes of

new case counts within the entire period. We then define a trajectory distance matrix with respect
to cases, DCij = ||fi − f j ||, i, j = 1, ..., n.
Next, we can do the same for mobility and price data. To ensure comparably normalized
trajectories, we must linearly adjust these by subtracting their minimum value. That is, let µ̃i (t) =
µi (t) − mint µi (t) for each country, analogously for p̃i (t). We define normalized mobility and price

||µ̃i ||

and hi =

p̃i
||p̃i || ,

respectively. Analogously as before, we define trajectory

P
distance matrices with respect to mobility and prices, DM
i j = ||gi − g j ||, Di j = ||hi − h j ||. We note

that COVID-19 cases exhibit their minimal value as zero, so do not need to be linearly adjusted.
In Figures 2, 3 and 4, we display hierarchical clustering on the matrices DC , DM , DP , respectively,
and proceed to interpret these results. Hierarchical clustering provides a convenient, accessible
and visual means of identifying structural similarity in a collection of time series, such as which
countries are most similar to each other. It provides a high-level understanding of the data, which
may then be followed by more specific, targeted analysis. We supply additional analyses of the
time series dynamics throughout the paper.

B.

Results for COVID-19 time series
First, the cases trajectory dendrogram (Figure 2) is comprised of 2 clusters, a large predominant

cluster and a small cluster of outlier countries - Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. The
common theme among the latter countries is their low total number of cases throughout the year
and their suppressed new cases towards the end of 2020, as can be seen for Singapore in Figure 5a.
The larger cluster is characterized by new case trajectories exhibiting multiple waves of new cases,
with many countries experiencing significant growth in cases towards the end of 2020, as can be
seen for the U.S. in Figure 5b.
To confirm our findings, we implement a simple analysis to quantify whether countries exhibited
the majority of their cases earlier or later in the year. Given a country’s new case time series xi (t),
we treat the case counts as a distribution over t = 0, ..., T and calculate its median. Specifically,
(i)

we determine the minimal T1/2 such that ∑0≤t≤T (i) xi (t) ≥ ∑T (i) <t≤T xi (t). We record the values of
1/2

expressed in terms of their corresponding calendar dates, in Table II. We confirm what we

initially observed in Figure 2, that New Zealand, Singapore and Australia have earlier values of
(i)

T1/2 than the remainder of the collection, explaining their nature as outliers.

C.

Results for mobility time series
Next, the mobility trajectory dendrogram (Figure 3) is comprised of 2 comparably-sized clusters.

The first cluster includes Argentina, Australia, Brazil, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and
Singapore. Mobility trajectories within this cluster experience a sharp dip early in the year, then a

quick partial recovery, followed by a consistent marginal increase (or flattening off) throughout
the rest of the year. These trajectories are representative of countries that experienced surges of
COVID-19 cases earlier in 2020, imposed restrictions to reduce case counts, and gradually reopened
their economies, such as Singapore (Figure 5c). The second cluster consists of Canada, Denmark,
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, the U.K. and the
U.S. Countries within this cluster exhibit the same sharp dip early in the year, followed by almost a
complete recovery in mobility, but then declining trajectories for the rest of the year. As seen for
the U.S. (Figure 5d), this trajectory reveals a near-complete reopening and reduction of restrictions
during the middle of the year, followed by further waves of cases that prompted the reinstatement
of restrictions. Indeed, almost every U.S. state had reduced restrictions by May,72 and subsequently
had to reimpose them as cases rose once again. Interestingly, the two clusters exhibit striking
geographical affinity. The first cluster consists of countries in South America and Oceania, while the
second cluster comprises European and North American countries. This highlights the similarity in
the timing of lockdowns among many countries in proximal geographies and could reflect common

approaches among the policymakers of these respective countries.
Having observed this striking split into two clusters, we implement a new analytical method
to further study this distinction quantitatively. Essentially, we wish to determine, on a country-bycountry basis, the total length of time that each mobility time series was increasing vs decreasing.
µ

First, we note that every mobility time series µi (t) experienced its global minimum Ti at approximately the same time, in March/April. The primary distinction between the two cluster behaviors
µ

occurs after this global minimum. Thus, we restrict attention to the period t ≥ Ti .
Our approach adopts the flexible algorithmic framework of Ref. 73 to analyze the mobility time
µ

series over the period t ≥ Ti . We begin by smoothing out each truncated (and minimum-adjusted)
µ

time series to yield a new series νi (t),t = Ti , ..., T . Then, we have two approaches, one relatively
simple and one novel, to determine periods of increase and decrease. For the naive approach,
µ

let Ai be the number of “ascending” days t = Ti , .., T − 1 such that νi (t) ≤ νi (t + 1). This is
determined with the smoothed time series, so as not to be influenced by daily perturbation in the
data surrounding the true signal. Our novel method, fully described in Appendix A, identifies
10

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
non-trivial turning points in each time series νi (t), both local maxima and minima, beginning with
µ

a minimum at Ti . Every day following a local minimum or maximum is counted as an increasing
or decreasing period, respectively, until the next turning point is observed. With this definition,
let Bi be the number of days of increasing periods. Results from both the naive approach (Ai ) and
novel method (Bi ) are recorded in Table II.
The results from our additional experiment confirm and quantify our observations from the
hierarchical clustering in Figure 3, and characterize a clear difference in the dynamics of these
mobility time series. As discussed before, hierarchical clustering identifies two distinct groups.
Ordering countries in Table II by their increasing value of Bi yields Spain, Russia, Denmark, the U.S.,
Canada, Netherlands, the U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, and then Japan, New Zealand,
Singapore, India, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, Brazil. We observe that each previously observed
cluster is an unbroken interval with respect to ordering by Bi . This suggests that the observed cluster
split in Figure 3 can be largely explained by this difference in periods of increase or decrease. One
cluster features countries where mobility time series exhibited decrease for much of the year, while
the countries of the other cluster exhibited many more days of increase. The naive method obtains
similar results, ordering the countries as Denmark, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, the
U.K., Italy, Spain, Russia, the U.S., Switzerland, Japan, France, New Zealand, Mexico, Australia,
Singapore, Argentina, Brazil, and India. This almost exactly corresponds to the two clusters in
Figure 3, with the switching of France and Japan. The similarity of the two approaches supports
the robustness of our analysis.

D.

Results for financial index time series
Third, the financial trajectory dendrogram (Figure 4) consists of 2 clusters, a primary cluster and

a smaller anomalous cluster, consisting of Mexico, Singapore, Spain and the U.K. These countries
share similar financial index trajectories: there is a large drop in March, a subsequent drop until
November and a moderate recovery during the latter half of November and December, as can be
seen for Singapore (Figure 5e). All of these countries’ financial indices finish the year lower than
their pre-COVID position. The dominant cluster, which consists of the remaining countries, exhibits
far less uniform trajectories. Broadly speaking, countries in the dominant cluster experienced more
substantial recoveries than the anomalous cluster. For instance, New Zealand and the U.S., which
possess highly similar financial trajectories, both exhibit consistent gains after their precipitous

drops in March, as can be seen for the U.S. in Figure 5f.
The preceding analysis highlights several noteworthy points regarding the consistency in country
cluster behaviors:
1. There is little consistency in cluster structure among COVID-19 cases, mobility data and
financial index performance. The size of the clusters is highly variable. However, in all
dendrograms, there are 2 main clusters.
2. There is little consistency in cluster composition. In both the COVID-19 cases and financial
index dendrograms, there is a small, anomalous cluster, but limited intersection between the
countries in each anomalous cluster. This highlights a lack of consistency in how countries
group under different metrics.
3. There is clearly no relationship between countries’ financial index performance and their
mobility or COVID-19 trajectories. The most obvious example of this is Singapore. Hier12

archical clustering highlights that Singapore managed COVID-19 cases anomalously well,
while its financial index performance was anomalously poor. By contrast, the U.S. leads the
world in COVID-19 cases and deaths, but exhibited robust financial index performance after
the initial drop in March.

COLLECTIVE TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS

In this section, we seek to determine collective similarity among the three attributes under
consideration. Specifically, we wish to measure the similarity of relative moment between new
cases, changes in mobility, and market price. For this purpose, we define a symmetric 60 × 60

is a normalized inner product that takes values in [0, 1]. Two time series f and g have maximal
similarity < f , g >n = 1 if and only if f = kg for a constant k > 0 - this is an important property for
our application. The matrix M uses this pairing to measure similarity between all three attributes
and is defined as follows:

First, we explain why we use this pairing rather than the more standard correlation or distance
correlation metrics. Two new case time series xi and x j have maximal correlation or distance
correlation 1 if xi = kx j + b for constants k > 0 and b. This property is unsuitable for uncovering
similarity between time series regarding movement relative to itself. For example, if the cases of
one country xi change linearly from 0 to 100 and return to 0, this would be maximally correlated
with the cases of another country x j that change linearly from 1000 to 1100 and return to 1000 over
the same time period. Clearly, these countries differ substantially in their changes in new cases
relative to themselves, with x j exhibiting a much flatter trajectory and less movement relative to
itself. The same reasoning applies for mobility and price trajectories.
We perform hierarchical clustering on M in Figure 6, and observe substantial structure in this
15

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
dendrogram. Financial and mobility trajectories are highly similar both across different countries
and to each other, while COVID-19 case trajectories are significantly less similar. Both the mobility
and financial index trajectories exhibit similar shapes: there is generally a sharp drop around
March, followed by a subsequent recovery in community mobility and market price later in the
year. COVID-19 cases, on the other hand, exhibit more heterogeneous trajectories. Indeed, due
to the infectious nature of the virus and differing government approaches, COVID-19 case counts
may change substantially over time and form different waves of the outbreak, constituting multiple
peaks and troughs throughout the year.

We can quantify the level of heterogeneity between the three data attributes by further examining
the matrix M. Restricting M to its first 20 × 20 rows and columns yields a matrix Mcase that
describes the similarity between countries’ case trajectories. We can similarly produce Mmob and
Mfin . Given an n × n matrix A, define its (normalized) L1 norm by ||A|| =

1
n2

∑ni, j=1 |Ai j |. Applied

to Mcase , Mmob and Mfin , these norms quantify the total (average) similarity within these matrices.
We see that ||Mmob || = 0.93, indicating an average similarity of 0.93 between all the mobility
trajectories, while ||Mfin || = 0.77 and ||Mcase || = 0.61. This reveals the strongest self-similarity
between mobility trajectories, followed by financial and then case trajectories. Indeed, mobility
trajectories exhibit substantial homogeneity, with only slight differences described between the 2
clusters of Figure 3.

Figure 6 also contains numerous insights pertaining to specific countries. For example, the
case trajectories of Australia, New Zealand and Singapore are identified as highly anomalous, as
observed previously in Figure 2. Singapore and Spain’s financial trajectories, while somewhat
similar to other financial indices, are revealed as moderately anomalous, as discussed in Figure 4.
Australia and New Zealand have highly similar mobility trajectories, reflecting the two government’s
similarly aggressive responses in limiting public movement.74 Even with the substantial similarity
between mobility and financial trajectories as a whole, there is no tendency for trajectories to be
grouped based on country. For example, neither Singapore nor the U.S.’ COVID-19 cases, mobility
or financial index trajectories cluster similarly.

TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF COMMUNITY AND FINANCIAL RESPONSE TO

COVID-19

In this section, we analyze the collective similarity between mobility data and financial indices
in more detail. In particular, we investigate mobility activity or financial indices responded first to
the pandemic - and whether this varied among countries. Our analytical approach uses the same
three multivariate time series of the previous section as proxy data sets: COVID-19 cases, averaged
mobility data and country financial indices. Observing these time series, we can see that most
countries experienced their first peak in COVID-19 cases, signifying the height of the first wave, at
a similar time as the first troughs in mobility and price data. We pay particular attention to these
first critical points in the time series. In order to remove outlier points, we smooth out all time
series in the proceeding analysis. Applying the flexible algorithmic framework of Ref. 73, detailed
in Appendix A, let TiC be the time at which the first peak (local maximum) in (smoothed) cases
occurred for country i = 1, ..., n. Analogously, let TiM and TiP be the times at which the global

minimum in smoothed mobility and prices occurred, for i = 1, ..., n. For every mobility and price
time series other than Singapore’s price index, this global minimum coincides with the first trough
(local minimum) in smoothed mobility and prices, respectively. That is, except for Singapore as
an anomaly, the times TiM and TiP are the first troughs in (smoothed) mobility and prices, and are
thus appropriate to compare with TiC . We can then define a critical point distance matrix between
countries as follows:

critical distance between these critical points for any candidate country. With q > 0 a fixed

These values are appropriately normalized for comparison as the parameter q varies. If q = 1,
this simplifies to 23 (max{TiC , TiM , TiP } − min{TiC , TiM , TiP }). When q < 1, this internal distance
becomes smaller when the middle critical value is closer to one of the end points and thus rewards
(via a smaller total value) less equally distributed points. When q > 1 the reverse occurs - diint
penalizes equally distributed points. The values of diint for all 20 countries and varying values of q
are recorded in Table III.

TABLE III: Internal critical distances between critical points TiC , TiM , TiP for every country and
various parameters q.

Viewed in conjunction, Figure 7 and Table III reveal notable anomalies in the timing of the
critical points of COVID-19 cases, mobility data and financial indices. The countries with the
five greatest internal distances, as recorded in Table III, for any value of q, are Argentina, Brazil,
India, Mexico and Singapore. All of these also appear as outliers in Figure 7. Singapore is a lone
outlier due to a financial minimum occurring late in the year, much later than any other country.
If we were to change the definition of TiP to be the first trough, Singapore would disappear as an
outlier. We choose to document it as it is, noting its unique status in having a second and more
substantial minimum in (smoothed) index price later in the year (Figure 5e). Argentina, Brazil,
India and Mexico occur as an outlier cluster in Figure 7. All four of these emerging economies
exhibit similar early troughs in mobility activity and financial indices when compared with the
other countries under consideration. They are anomalous due to their much later first peaks in
COVID-19 cases, as seen in Figure 8. Brazil and Mexico, which form a subcluster pair, exhibit
their first peak in smoothed cases near the start of August (Figures 8b and 8d respectively). India
20

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
and Argentina, which also form a subcluster pair, exhibit their first peaks in cases in September and
October, respectively (Figures 8c and 8a, respectively). That is, COVID-19 cases were consistently
and uniformly rising throughout almost the whole year in these countries.

On the other hand, the countries with the lowest internal critical distances (both for q = 1/2
and q = 1) are, in order, Italy, France, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Spain, and the U.K. Once again, we observe substantial similarity in these countries - all are wealthy
European nations. Together with similarly developed countries Australia and New Zealand, these
form a subcluster of close similarity in Figure 7. This reveals that all these countries behaved
similarly relative to COVID-19 counts, mobility data and financial indices early in the year, with an
early COVID-19 peak, mobility trough and financial trough in March. Of course, the latter half of
2020 featured substantial differences between, for example, Australia and New Zealand and the
aforementioned European countries, as shown in Figure 2 and analyzed further in Table II.

Nowhere in the preceding analysis do we determine whether TiM or TiP occurred first; we only
consider the absolute distances in these values between each other and other countries. We conclude
this section with an inner product-based optimization framework that computes an offset between
the mobility and financial time series for each country. This considers all data points in the time
series (not just the critical points) to identify whether mobility data lags financial performance
or vice versa. Specifically, we wish to determine the offset τ ∈ {−30, −29, ..., −1, 0, 1, ..., 29, 30}
for each country i that most appropriately aligns the function p̃i (t) with the translated function
µ̃i (t + τ). If τ > 0, this means the values of µ̃i (t + τ) most resemble those of p̃i (t), and hence that
mobility data is lagging prices. We allow τ to be both positive or negative, so our approach remains
flexible to the possibility of either time series lagging the other. We define our normalized inner
product in full generality as follows: let p̃ and µ̃ be the minimum-adjusted price and mobility time
series, respectively, of a given country (see Section III) and define

using the same notation. We document the optimal offset values in Table IV. We record the absolute
value |τ| of each offset, as well as the interpretation of whether mobility lags (when τ > 0) or price
lags (when τ < 0).
We summarize several findings revealed therein:
1. In general, mobility trajectories lag financial index trajectories. In fact, only 3 of the 20
countries possess trajectories where their mobility activity reflects COVID-19 case data more
22

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
quickly than the respective financial index.
2. There is significant variability in the offset among countries. The range of offsets is 21
days, with Japan’s mobility data lagging 18 days behind its price index, while Denmark and
Italy’s mobility data lead 3 days ahead of their price indices. Spain and Switzerland have the
smallest absolute offsets of only 2 days, indicating substantial concurrence of mobility and
financial data.
3. In general, the extent of mobility lagging suggests that communities were overwhelmingly
slower to respond to the impact of COVID-19 than financial markets. In particular, using
community activity and mobility data to predict financial movement is likely to be systematically flawed, as financial markets reacted well before such data was available. We believe that
the mobility data reflects government restrictions as well, because imposed restrictions, such
as movement restrictions or business closures, may have an immediate impact on people’s
queries regarding walking, driving and transit to nearby destinations in their community. We
further discuss such interpretations in Section VI.

VI.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have analyzed 20 countries with significant financial economies, examining
their Apple mobility and financial data in relation to their COVID-19 counts. The mobility data
is a useful representative for the current level of community activity and hence, we will argue,
the current level of government restrictions imposed on the community. In our analysis, we have
demonstrated that there is little consistency in cluster membership when examining the trajectories
of COVID-19 cases, mobility activity and financial index performance. Explored in more detail in
Figure 7, we saw there is no tendency for specific countries’ features to be clustered together. This
is most clearly evidenced by Singapore, who managed its COVID-19 case numbers particularly
well but had uniquely weak performance in its financial index. By contrast, the United States
experienced huge COVID-19 case and death counts, while the national equity index experienced
strong performance after the market crash in March.
In addition, we investigated the varying heterogeneity of COVID-19 cases, mobility and financial
data across our collection of countries. Both qualitatively, in the descriptions of Figures 2, 3 and 4
as well as quantitatively, by examining ||Mcase ||, ||Mmob || and ||Mfin ||, we have observed the highest
23

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
homogeneity in mobility trajectories. Even where mobility trajectories split into two clusters in
Figure 3, the difference in behavior between the two clusters was relatively mild, and could largely
be explained by differing periods of increase and decrease in Table II. On the other hand, COVID-19
cases exhibited the most substantial heterogeneity between countries, consistent with the natural
history of COVID-19 varying substantially around the world.
Examining the mobility and price trajectories in a temporal analysis revealed that most developed
countries experienced a small lag between the first trough in mobility and financial data, around the
same time as their first peak in cases. However, emerging economies Argentina, Brazil, India and
Mexico experienced their first peak in cases much later, especially for Argentina and India. The
finding that mobility data lagged financial data is significant for two reasons. First, it shows that an
analysis of such mobility data to predict financial market performance during the pandemic (both
in the past and going forward) is likely to be misguided, as financial time series consistently led the
mobility time series. Secondly, it suggests that governments, whose restrictions were arguably the
main cause of dips in mobility data, were less efficient in reacting and imposing restrictions than
market participants.
There are numerous strengths, possible interpretations, and limitations to this article, and our
results could be of interest to various different entities, including economists, behavioral researchers,
and governments. One potential interpretation of the mobility data is a proxy for certain aspects and
sectors of the community’s real economy, as distinct from a country’s financial economy. Indeed,
researchers have consistently aimed to study the impact of the pandemic on the real economy, but
have experienced difficulties, as traditional economic metrics such as GDP and unemployment are
typically available on an infrequent basis. During the pandemic, various market participants have
attempted to use mobility data as a means to detect a revival in the real economy.3 This makes
sense, as community activity, while not associated with all sectors or aspects of the economy, may
be closely associated with certain sectors such as retail, hospitality, and transport.
Next, Apple mobility data has a relationship with the current level of government restrictions
imposed on a community. Indeed, Apple mobility data has been used previously by researchers
to measure the current impact of and adherence to social distancing, one of the most commonly
enacted government regulations.35 We do not study government response as an explicit variable, as
this is difficult to quantify for the purposes of time series analysis. Instead, we rely on mobility data
as a related, but not perfect, proxy. Previous research36 has shown a close relationship between
stay-at-home orders and mobility, demonstrating that the decline in mobility data observed in
24

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
March/April actually preceded government restrictions in certain locations. That is, government
response was even slower than mobility data (which we have shown, in turn, was slower than
financial markets). The same work also found that trip requests in certain locations increased after
lockdown interventions were lifted. Thus, there is certainly a considerable association between
mobility data and government restrictions, though they are not identically aligned.
Therefore, our analysis of the dynamics of financial indices and mobility data may complement
existing research well, showing broadly speaking that financial markets preceded the change in
community mobility, which preceded government actions, at least in imposing restrictions in
March/April of 2020. Our research may therefore be of use to market analysts, those interested in
community activity, and governments. Other strengths of this article include the fact that mobility
is analyzed across 19 countries, rather than existing studies that have studied just several cities, and
mobility data is analyzed in comparison with financial data. In addition, we have determined not
just broad trends between mobility data and financial indices, but determined which time series
lagged and by how much for every country under consideration.
Drawing such interpretations from Apple mobility data and comparing its dynamics with
financial indices carries numerous limitations and avenues of improvement in future research. First,
we lack a control group, so can make no claims on the causality of certain time series moving before
others.75 Thus, we can only suggest, but not definitively state, that COVID-19 cases impacted
financial markets before community activity. Second, financial markets are a complex system, and
may contain dynamics that our analysis may not be privy to. Third, in order to compare different
countries, we have had to average mobility indicators. While we have demonstrated these were
highly correlated, this may reduce specific insights. For example, walking and driving are likely to
be more associated with the retail sector, while the transit indicator is much more representative
of the transport sector of the economy. The strength of the hospitality sector may be associated
with both the walking and driving indicators (representing the patronage of locals) and the transit
indicator (representing the patronage of tourists). Fourth, Apple mobility data includes any lookup
of directions, and does not correspond exactly to community movement. These all make the Apple
mobility data an imperfect representative of community mobility or the current level of government
restrictions.
Financial markets are notorious for their complexity, with many variables and interrelationships
making it near impossible to extract clear causal relationships. This is often the reason many statistical learning algorithms, when applied to problems in financial markets, exhibit low signal:noise
25

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
ratios. It is virtually impossible to engineer parametric models with complexity sufficient to model
the true data generating process of financial market behaviors, without over-fitting. Our approach
allows for reasonable inference on which time series led and lagged in a complex, high dimensional
system, where devising sufficiently complex algorithms is a difficult task. Our approach yields key
descriptive findings, even though a full description of the dynamics and interplay of mobility and
financial time series would be extremely challenging and is an ongoing goal of the field.
Future research could address these limitations in various ways. Rather than averaging all
available mobility indicators, a closer analysis of individual indicators could provide more insights.
For example, public transportation is more directly responsive to shifts in government restrictions,
while car transportation may closer represent autonomous community movement. Our analysis
of country financial indices could be replaced with a finer analysis on a sector-by-sector basis to
determine the sectors with the most responsive market participants. In particular, some financial
sectors may be more responsive to or impactful on mobility data, including individual indicators.
Alternatively, one could study the behavior of other asset classes and the underlying relationships
with mobility data. Asset classes such as fixed income, cryptocurrencies, and commodities such as
gold and oil may all exhibit varied relationships with mobility data. Finally, instead of analyzing
daily mobility data, one could examine other daily data that represents the current activity of the real
economy or level of government restrictions, or even incorporate traditional economic metrics that
are less frequently available. Due to the infrequent nature of traditional metrics, market participants
are always on the lookout for such indicators.
Overall, this manuscripts presents several findings regarding the structure and dynamics of
COVID-19 cases, Apple mobility data and financial indices across 19 countries. We have combined
existing techniques such as hierarchical clustering with new analytical methods to provide visual
inference regarding countries’ similarity relative to these attributes, followed by more quantifiable
details. Our principal findings are that mobility time series exhibited more homogeneity among
countries than case or financial time series, and usually lagged behind financial indices. Our paper
complements existing research and offers several avenues for further study.

Appendix A: Turning point methodology
In this section, we provide more details for the identification of turning points of a smoothed
time series, which we utilize twice in the body of the paper. In Section III, we apply this procedure
to smoothed truncated mobility time series to calculate the parameter Bi ; in Section V, we apply it
to a new case time series xi (t) to isolate the first non-trivial trough TiC . In both cases, smoothing is
necessary due to noise and irregularities in the data sets. We apply a Savitzy-Golay filter, which
combines polynomial interpolation and a moving average computation, to perform the smoothing.
The initial steps are as follows. Given a mobility time series µi (t), we identify its global
µ

minimum Ti , which occurs in March/April 2020 for every country. We form the minimumµ

adjusted time series µ̃i (t) and truncate it to the period t = Ti , ..., T . This series is non-negative
µ

everywhere, beginning with a zero value at its initial value t = Ti . Then, we perform the smoothing
to produce a smoothed truncated time series νi (t) ∈ R≥0 , beginning with an initial value of zero.
Given a new case time series xi (t), we simply apply smoothing immediately to yield a smoothed
time series x̂i (t). We proceed by describing our methodology on both time series: let ẑ(t) be an
arbitrary smoothed time series, beginning with a minimal value of 0 at its initial value, which we
label t = 0.
Following Ref. 73, we apply a two-step algorithm to ẑ(t). The first step produces an alternating
sequence of troughs and peaks, beginning with a trough at t = 0, where the time series exhibits
its global minimum. The second step refines this sequence according to chosen conditions and
parameters. The most important conditions to initially identify a peak or trough, respectively, are
the following:
ẑ(t0 ) = max{ẑ(t) : max(0,t0 − l) ≤ t ≤ min(t0 + l, T )},

(A1)

ẑ(t0 ) = min{x̂(t) : max(0,t0 − l) ≤ t ≤ min(t0 + l, T )},

(A2)

where l is a parameter to be chosen. Following Ref. 73, we select l = 17, originally inspired by the
14-day incubation period of the virus.77 Defining peaks and troughs according to this definition
alone has some flaws, such as the potential for two consecutive peaks.
Instead, we implement an inductive procedure to choose an alternating sequence of peaks and
troughs. Suppose t0 is the last determined peak. We search in the period t > t0 for the first of two
cases: if we find a time t1 > t0 that satisfies (A2) as well as a non-triviality condition ẑ(t1 ) < ẑ(t0 ),
27

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
we add t1 to the set of troughs and proceed from there. If we find a time t1 > t0 that satisfies (A1)
and ẑ(t0 ) ≥ ẑ(t1 ), we ignore this lower peak as redundant; if we find a time t1 > t0 that satisfies (A1)
and ẑ(t1 ) > ẑ(t0 ), we remove the peak t0 , replace it with t1 and continue from t1 . A similar process
applies from a trough at t0 .
At this point, the time series is assigned an alternating sequence of troughs and peaks. However,
some turning points are immaterial and should be removed. Let t1 < t3 be two peaks, necessarily
separated by a trough. We select a parameter δ = 0.2, and if the peak ratio, defined as

ẑ(t3 )
ẑ(t1 )

< δ , we

remove the peak t3 . If two consecutive troughs t2 ,t4 remain, we remove t2 if ẑ(t2 ) > ẑ(t4 ), otherwise
remove t4 . That is, if the second peak has size less than δ of the first peak, we remove it.
Finally, we use the same log-gradient function between times t1 < t2 , defined as
log-grad(t1 ,t2 ) =

log ẑ(t2 ) − log ẑ(t1 )
.
t2 − t1

(A3)

2)
The numerator equals log( x̂(t
x̂(t ) ), a "logarithmic rate of change." Unlike the standard rate of change
1

given by

ẑ(t2 )
ẑ(t1 )

− 1, the logarithmic change is symmetrically between (−∞, ∞). Let t1 ,t2 be adjacent

turning points (one a trough, one a peak). We choose a parameter ε = 0.01; if
| log-grad(t1 ,t2 )| < ε,

(A4)

that is, the average logarithmic change is less than 1%, we remove t2 from our sets of peaks and
troughs. If t2 is not the final turning point, we also remove t1 .
We conclude with an alternating sequence of peaks and troughs, beginning with a trough at the
initial value. From here, we may extract the parameters that we use in the body of the text. First,
consider the minimum-adjusted smoothed truncated time series νi (t). Let
µ

(A5)

µ

(A6)

Ai = |{t : Ti ≤ t ≤ T − 1, νi (t) ≤ νi (t + 1)}|;
Bi = |{t : Ti ≤ t ≤ T − 1, the turning point immediately preceding t is a trough}|.

We refer to Ai and Bi as the naive and novel approaches to count the number of increasing days.
The second approach counts periods of more essential increase, whereas Ai is more vulnerable
to insubstantial day-to-day fluctuations in the data, even after smoothing. Both these counts are
recorded in Table II. Finally, consider a (smoothed) new case time series x̂i (t). We simply define
28

Efficiency of communities and financial markets during the 2020 pandemic
TiC to be the first trough after t = 0, which exists for every country. This marks the end of the first
wave.
