India is one of the worst affected countries by the Covid-19 pandemic at present. We studied
publicly available data of the Covid-19 patients in India and analyzed possible impacts of quarantine and social distancing within the stochastic framework of the SEQIR model to illustrate the
controlling strategy of the pandemic. Our simulation results clearly show that proper quarantine
and social distancing should be maintained from an early time just at the start of the pandemic
and should be continued till its end to effectively control the pandemic. This calls for a more
socially disciplined lifestyle in this perspective in future. The demographic stochasticity, which
is quite visible in the system dynamics, has a critical role in regulating and controlling the pandemic.

Introduction
The peculiar nature of Covid-19 disease is the special form of pneumonia it causes and its fast spreading in the
entire population. This dreaded Covid-19 disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the disease outbreak was
announced as a pandemic of special health attention by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March, 2020.
As of June 2, 2020 (10:06am CEST), there is a total Covid-19 confirmed case of 6,140,934 with 373,548 deaths all
over the world [1]. India is one of the countries which is now seriously affected by this pandemic. As of June 2,
2020 (7:45pm IST), there are a total of 2,01,341 confirmed cases with 99,135 active cases and 5,632 deaths in India
[2]. The present situation of the outbreak is alarming since there is no vaccine/drug so far to cure this disease. The
Indian Government, both at the central and state levels, has taken up special measures such as quarantine, social
distancing and lockdown to prevent/intervene this pandemic across the country.
Mathematical epidemic models play important roles to study and predict disease dynamics as well as to implement
necessary intervention strategies to control disease outbreak. Classic compartmental models such as the SI, SIS,
SIR [3], SEIR and their derived/extended models [4] have long been successfully used to study various disease
transmission dynamics for different viruses such as H1N1 virus [5], Ebola virus [6], SARS-CoV [7], MERS-CoV
[8], etc. With special reference to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, there have been attempts using statistical
methods, deterministic compartmental modeling, large scale simulation to study the Covid-19 disease dynamics
in order to assist in mitigating the disease outbreak in several countries across the world. There have also been
various studies in India regarding this Covid-19 outbreak in the country using various mathematical models which
are mostly deterministic models [9–20]. On the other hand, to capture the qualitative as well as quantitative
real dynamical situations to intervene disease outbreak, stochastic approach needs to be employed. With the
increasing capacity of modern computers, stochastic methods are gaining popularity because of being a powerful
means to study and predict any complex dynamical system inherent with various environmental fluctuations/noise.
In this work, we study the Covid-19 disease dynamics in India and some of its states using the classic SEQIR
model from stochastic dynamics approach. Using stochastic numerical simulation, we illustrate in a very simplified
manner the important impacts of social distancing and quarantine on the disease spreading mechanism specially in
India and few states. We also highlight the importance of demographic stochasticity in the disease spreading dynamics.

Methods
The classical SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered) model [4] was extended with another sensitive
compartment called quarantine and the model is known as SEQIR model [16] as shown in Fig. 1. In this model,
the total population is sub-divided into five sub-populations (compartments) such as susceptible (S); exposed and
infected but not detected by testing (E); self and/or institutional quarantined (Q); confirmed/reported/hospitalized
infected population (I) and disease-recovered as well as population living in secured zone not affected by the Covid19 outbreak (R). We assume uniform mixing or homogeneity in the large population and also assume the total
population at any instant of time is, N = S(t) + E(t) + Q(t) + I(t) + R(t). Further, the change in population is

in discrete integer amounts and the process of changing is a stochastic Markov process. Hence, the time evolution
of each variable in the model should be considered in discrete and stochastic fashion [21]. In stochastic formalism
of the model system [Fig. 1 and set of coupled differential equations (1)-(5)], the population state vector at any
instant of time can be represented by, X = [S, E, Q, I, R]−1 , which undergo M = 15 reaction channels defined by,

molecules respectively, and {k} is the set of the classical rate constants. Further, the classical rate constants, kj can
be related to the stochastic rate constants, cj by cj = kj V 1−ν , where ν is the stoichiometric ratio and V is the system
size [21, 23]. This incorporates the idea of correlating fluctuations in the dynamics of the system [21–23]. Now, the
reaction channels can be translated as,

where, α is the rate of disease transmission from the Susceptible to the Exposed and infected but not detected by

If the system is subjected to a certain temperature T , the trajectory of any variable in X suffers a set of random
molecular events given by the set of reactions (1) and follows Brownian motion [21–23]. Further, every time any one
of the reaction sets is encountered, creation and annihilation of the molecular species will take place and hence, the
state vector X will get changed as a function of time. Consider the state change from state X to another state X′
during the time interval [t, t + ∆t], then the time evolution of the configurational probability of state change P (X; t)
is given by the following Master equation constructed from the detailed balance equation [24–26],

The Master equation (2) for complex multivariate systems is generally difficult to solve except for simple ones.
However, the Master equation of any complex system can be solved numerically using the stochastic simulation
algorithm (SSA) which is discussed briefly here. SSA is generally known as Doob-Gillespie algorithm, formulated
by Gillespie [21, 22] based on the theoretical foundations developed by Doob JL [27, 28] and originally proposed by
Kendall [29]. It is a Monte-Carlo type of algorithm, which is a non-spatial individual based analog of the Master
equation incorporating all possible interactions in the system [21]. The SSA is built on two independent processes
which are random viz. firing reaction and reaction time. These independent processes are realized by the generation
of two uniform random numbers
X r1 and r2 which are statistically independent. The reaction time is computed using
τ = − a10 ln(r1 ), where, a0 =
ai , where ai is the ith propensity function given by ai = hi ci , where, hi is the number
i

of possible molecular combinations of ith reaction. The j th reaction will fire when it satisfies,

Results and Discussion
We present below the simulation results of the model proposed, discuss the analysis and provide possible prediction
of the Covid-19 pandemic in India and few states which are affected seriously. In population dynamics, one can

express V as , V = N/V
= N
D ; where, N is the total population in the geographical area, and D is the population

.
density. Taking N as constant, we can correlate the change in V as change in the D by, V ∝ D
Scenario 1 (India): We numerically simulate the time-evolution of the infected population I(t) in India using SSA
under different conditions. The rate constants values and initial values for the simulation are taken from [16] by
verifying to the present data from March 21, 2020 to May 31, 2020 [2]. The population of Covid-19 infected people
in India, I(t), is greatly effected by population density D [Fig. 2 (a), (b)], and is not homogeneously distributed
over India. From the simulation results, dynamics of I for various values of V (or D), it is observed that at values
N
of V < 1.7 [D > 1.7
], I(t) is increased exponentially indicating monotonic increase in infection if the density of
population D increases (Malthusian law [30] in the increase in infected population). The curves start flattening
N
(Gompertz-Winsor nature [31]) around V ≥ 1.7 [D ≤ 1.7
], which is the signature of endemic [Fig. 2 (b)], and the
fluctuations in the dynamics due to D playing important role in intervening the disease spreading. Hence, from these
results it can be predicted that the controlling population density could lead to the endemic of Covid-19 pandemic
in India. In other words, the strategy to decrease in D could be isolation of susceptible and exposed from infectious
people either by quarantine them (at home or isolated place) or lockdown of socially interacting places (academic
institutions, offices, festivals etc).
In Fig. 2 (c), the sensitivity of the model is studied with respect to the parameter α, which is the disease
transmission rate from S to E population Fig. 1, at a particular value V = 0.7. As the value of α increases,
the population I(t) increases sharply. This corresponds to the fact that for a certain demographic region, as
the transmission rate increases, due to homogeneous mixing of population, more S population gets exposed and
then infected with the disease. Further, we studied the impact of the quarantine rate, β2 on I(t), where, the
1
. In Fig. 2 (d), we see that as the quarantine rate increases
quarantine rate is given by, β2 ∼ delay in quarantine
or delay in quarantine decreases, I(t) also starts decreasing sharply. When there is no quarantine or β2 = 0.0,
the I(t) ∼ O(104 ). However, when β2 = 0.2 (quarantine in 5 days), I(t) starts flattening around ∼ O(103 ). This
result illustrates the important effect of quarantine on I(t) indicating quarantine of population E needs to be done
as quickly as possible and for longer time also for intervening the disease spreading. We know that flattening the
curve can prevent the burden on hospitals and health care facilities which in turn will keep the pandemic under control.
We again perform numerical simulation of the evolution of the infected population I(t) with respect to time t in five
Indian states namely, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Kerala, Maharashtra and West Bengal. These states are comparatively
highly affected by Covid-19 pandemic and densely populated states among other Indian states. The rate constant
values and initial values for the simulation of all five states are taken from [16] after verification with the present case.
Scenario 2 (Uttar Pradesh): It is observed in Fig. 2 (e), that at around t = 20 days, I(t) ∼ O(105 ) (V = 5 [D =
N
N
N
N
4

5 ]), I(t) ∼ O(10 ) (V = 7 [D = 7 ]), I(t) ∼ O(10 ) (V = 10, [D = 10 ]). When V ≈ 100 [D ≈ 100 ], the I(t)
curve √
starts flattening
indicating the intervention of the pandemic. Hence, the demographic stochasticity measured
√
by 1/ V ∝ D can control the time evolution of I(t), and consequently intervene disease spreading. Again,
in Fig. 2 (f) and (g), we studied the effect of quarantine on I(t) evolution for two values, V = 1.0 [D = N ]
N
]. In Figure 2 (f), at V = 1 [D = N ], quick quarantining E population (in hours)
and V = 100 [D = 100
is needed to prevent the disease outbreak and fast transmission of the disease. From Fig. 2 (g) for V = 100.0,
it can be seen that if the exposed E population is quarantined in ten days, the disease outbreak is relatively controlled.
Scenario 3 (Delhi): From the simulation results of the dynamics of I(t) for different values of V , it is seen that
the magnitude of I(t) varies drastically with the values of V . When V = 1 [D = N ], I(t) ∼ O(106 ), but when
V ≈ 5 [D ≈ N5 ], I(t) ∼ O(102 ). We also observe that the flattening of the curve is achieved at earlier times of the
disease outbreak if the values of V is increased. This could be due to the fact that the number density n of the
population decreases when V is increased as the total population N is fixed. The decrease in n may be considered
due to policy like social distancing, isolation etc. Our simulation study also clearly shows that social distancing
plays a crucial role in early times of the epidemic for proper intervention. Again, in Fig. 3 (b) and (c), the time
evolution of I(t) is studied at different quarantine rates at two different values V = 1 and V = 5 [D = N5 ]. For the
same parameter values, at V = 1 [D = N ], I(t) shows an exponential increase whereas when it is at V = 5 [D = N5 ],
I(t) already starts flattening and decreasing (also see 3(a)). In Fig. 3 (b) and (c), the magnitudes of I(t) at both
values of V are seen to decrease as the quarantine rate β2 increases. If the quarantine process of E population is

4
carried out as early as in two days, the disease spreading is greatly controlled (roughly 50 infected population in
our simulation of the model in consideration). This highlights the importance of quarantine as early as possible in
densely populated places during an epidemic. Hence, the simulation results based on the data indicates that the
disease spreading in Delhi is still not controlled properly and needed to take up serious precautions in the state, such
as, proper quarantine, social distancing, lockdown etc.
Scenario 4 (Kerala): The results of Kerala are quite different from others [Fig. 3 (d), (e), (f)]. The dynamics of
I(t) for different values of V show that the population I(t) decreases with increased in V . When V = 1 [D = N ],
I(t) ∼ O(106 ), whereas, for V ≈ 5 [D ≈ N5 ], I(t) ∼ O(102 ). We observed an overall decline in I(t) for all
V ≥ 1 [D = N ] leading to proper control of pandemic by monitoring infected population density D as discussed in
the above cases. We also found the effect of decreasing the number density n of the population (may be due to policy,
such as, social distancing as mentioned earlier) at early times of the epidemic could be a strategy for intervening the
pandemic. Again, in Fig. 3 (e) and (f), we studied the impact of quarantine (β2 ) on the time evolution of I(t) for
two different values V = 1 [D = N ] and V = 5 [D = N5 ]. In Fig. 3 (e) and (f), the magnitudes of I(t) at both values
of V decrease as the quarantine rate β2 increases. In Fig. 3 (e), if the quarantine process of E population is carried
out in ten days, then the I(t) curve becomes flatten, and, if the quarantine process is introduced in two days, then
the I(t) curve shows a decreasing trend. Further, in Fig. 3 (f), if the quarantine process of exposed E population is
carried out in two days, then the disease spreading is immensely controlled. This again highlights the importance of
quarantine as early as possible during a disease outbreak. Hence, disease spreading in Kerala is quite controlled as
compared to other Indian states.
Scenario 5 (Maharashtra): Now, Fig. 4 (a) shows the dynamics of I(t) for different values of V , and found that
I(t)to is decreased with V . When V = 1 [D = N ], peak I(t) ∼ O(107 ) indicating Malthusian character. However,
when V ≈ 5 [D ≈ N5 ], peak I(t) ∼ O(103 ) showing flattening of the curve, such that for V ≥ 5 [D ≤ N5 ], the
disease spreading is quite controlled. We, further, observed the effect of increasing the value of V or decreasing the
number density n of the population in controlling the number of infected populations I(t). Again, in Fig. 4 (b)
and (c), the time evolution of I(t) is again studied at different quarantine rates for two fixed values V = 1 [D = N ]
and V = 5 [D = N5 ]. The results showed that for small values of β2 , the dynamics of I(t) follow Malthusian law,
whereas, for significantly large values of β2 , the curves just start flattening indicating pandemic controlled behavior.
As obtained before, if the quarantine process of exposed E population is carried out as early as possible during a
disease outbreak, then the number of I(t) can be systematically controlled. But still the condition of Maharastra
state is alarming as compared to other state, and proper strategy needed to be taken up.
Scenario 6 (West Bengal): In the case of simulation results of West Bengal based data [Fig. 4 (d)], it is found that
when V = 1 [D = N ], peak I(t) ∼ O(108 ). However, for V ≈ 5 [D ≈ N5 ], we observed that peak I(t) ∼ O(102 )
indicating flattening of the curve, and for V i5 [Dh N5 ] the I(t) curves show decreasing nature which is the signature of
controlling of disease spreading. Further, in Fig. 4 (e) and (f), we studied the effect of quarantine on I(t) evolution
for two fixed values V = 1 [D = N ] and V = 5 [D = N5 ]. From the results we observed that if proper quarantine of
the exposed population (small values of β2 h0.5) increase in population I(t) is quite large and curve flattening takes
long time (100-200 days). But proper quarantine of population E is done (large values of β2 ≥ 0.5), the dynamics of
I(t) became decreased, and pandemic can be controlled. The data based simulation indicates that the scenario of
West Bengal is also still alarming as compared to other Indian states.
Disease spreading pattern: We, then, studied the how Covid-19 spread in the parameter space (α, β2 , I) as shown in
Fig. 5. The dynamics of I(t) for all the five Indian states at one particular value of V = 1000 for thirty realization
each show that the trajectories show peaks around 50 days [Fig. 5 left panel] and start declining. The dynamics
show that Covid-19 spreading in Kerala state is quite controlled as compared to other states. Then we calculated
I(t) after simulating hundred days in the parameter space (α, β2 , I) for India and her five states [Fig. 5 (a)-(f)].
From the plots, we observed that the population I is relatively large for a large value of α and small value of β2 . As
the value of β2 increases, the I population drops, and stochastic fluctuations can be seen in these heat maps. Hence,
in order to control the Covid-19 pandemic, the parameters α and β2 need to be optimized.

Conclusion
We have studied the stochastic SEQIR model in the context of Covid-19 disease dynamics in India and its five
comparatively worse affected states using stochastic methods. Our numerical simulation results show that policies like
social distancing and quarantine have important roles in controlling the disease outbreak and we propose to optimize
these two parameters to effectively intervene in the disease transmission. An important consequence of employing a

5
stochastic method is the importance of demographic fluctuations, which are quite visible in the simulation results, to
affect the disease dynamics and even in intervening the disease spread. This demographic stochasticity is generally
neglected in its deterministic counterpart which is quite important in regulating any system dynamics. Hence, our
stochastic simulation method could capture the demographic stochasticity which is non-negligible. We would like to
mention that we do not intend to give quantitative predictions here. One limitation of the model under consideration
is that by construction, populations from S and E compartments make transitions to the Q compartment where they
are assumed to interact homogeneously. This may give rise to a more infected population and we do not see the trends
of I(t) converging near zero over relatively less 300 days in our simulation. This also points out that policies such as
social distancing and quarantine of the exposed population are not sufficient enough to end the COVID-19 disease
outbreak. Other policies like complete lockdown and more testing of susceptible populations should be considered
and must be incorporated systematically in mathematical models.
