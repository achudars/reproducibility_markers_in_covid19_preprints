Abstract
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected most of the countries on Earth. It has
become a pandemic outbreak with more than 24 million confirmed infections and above
840 thousand deaths worldwide. In this study, we consider a mathematical model on
COVID-19 transmission with the prosocial awareness effect. The proposed model can
have four equilibrium states based on different parametric conditions. The local and
global stability conditions for awareness free, disease-free equilibrium is studied. Using
Lyapunov function theory and LaSalle Invariance Principle, the disease-free equilibrium
is shown globally asymptotically stable under some parametric constraints. The existence of unique awareness free, endemic equilibrium and unique endemic equilibrium is
presented. We calibrate our proposed model parameters to fit daily cases and deaths from
Colombia. Sensitivity analysis indicate that transmission rate and learning factor related
to awareness of susceptibles are very crucial for reduction in disease related deaths. Finally, we assess the impact of prosocial awareness during the outbreak and compare this
strategy with popular control measures. Results indicate that prosocial awareness has
competitive potential to flatten the curve.

1. Introduction
The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARSCoV-2 virus, a highly contagious virus, has been a massive threat for governments of
many affected countries. COVID-19 is causing obstacles for public health organizations
and is affecting almost every aspect of human life. The outbreak was declared a pandemic of international concern by WHO on March 11th , 2020 [1]. The virus can cause a

range of symptoms including dry cough, fever, fatigue, breathing difficulty, and bilateral
lung infiltration in severe cases, similar to those caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
infections [2; 3]. Many people may experience non-breathing symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea [4]. Chan et. al [5] confirmed that the virus spreads through
close contact of humans. It has become an epidemic outbreak with more than 24 million
confirmed infections and above 840 thousand deaths worldwide as of August 28th , 2020
[6].
Since first discovery and identification of coronavirus in 1965, three major outbreaks
occurred, caused by emerging, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, namely the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in mainland China [7; 8], the 2012
outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia [9; 10], and the
2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea [11; 12]. These outbreaks resulted in SARS and
MERS cases confirmed by more than 8000 and 2200, respectively [13]. The COVID-19
is caused by a new genetically similar corona virus to the viruses that cause SARS and
MERS. Despite a relatively lower death rate compared to SARS and MERS, the COVID19 spreads rapidly and infects more people than the SARS and MERS outbreaks. In spite
of strict intervention measures implemented in various affected areas, the infection spread
around the globe very rapidly. Due to nonavailability of vaccines and specific medications, non-pharmaceutical control measures such a social distancing, lockdown, use of
mask, use of PPE kits, awareness through media are studied using different theoretical
frameworks [14].
Mathematical modeling based on differential equations may provide a comprehensive
mechanism for the dynamics of the disease and also to test the efficacy of the control
strategies to reduce the burden of COVID-19. Several studies were performed using
real-life data from the affected countries and analyzed various features of the outbreak
as well as assess the impact of intervention such as lockdown approaches to suppress
the outbreak in the concerned countries [15; 16; 17; 18; 19]. There has been a few
mathematical models to assess the impact of awareness campaigns against COVID-19
[20; 21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26]. These research articles mainly incorporate the awareness
through media campaigns. The media effect is modelled in two ways: by adding media
compartment to COVID-19 model [22; 23; 25; 21; 24] and through reduction in incidence
function due to media campaigns [20; 26]. However, there is a scope of investigating prosocial awareness on the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. The idea is that the aware
susceptible persons will pass the information (regarding use face mask, social distancing,
mortality due to COVID-19 etc.) to the unaware susceptible individuals. The unaware
people become aware by contacting the aware susceptible and practice the self-protection
measures.
As a case study, we use daily notified cases and deaths in Colombia. With over

2

50 million inhabitants Colombia is the third-most-populous country in Latin America.
On March 6th , 2020, Colombia reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19. On
17th March, President Iván Duque spoke to the Colombians and declared the state of
emergency, announcing that he would take economic measures that were announced the
following day. The first measure taken seeking the protection of the elderly is to decree
mandatory isolation from 20th March, 2020 to 31st May, 2020 for all adults over 70 years
of age. They must remain in their residences except to stock up on food or access health
or financial services. Government entities were instructed to make it easier for them to
receive their pensions, medicines, healthcare or food at home. On the evening of 20th
March, President Iván Duque announced a 19-day nationwide quarantine, starting on
24th March at midnight and ending on 12th April at midnight [27]. As of August 28th ,
2020, there were more than 590 thousand confirmed cases (currently, the world’s 7th
highest) and above 18 thousand confirmed deaths [6]. As the outbreak of COVID-19 is
expanding rapidly in Colombia, real-time analysis of epidemiological data are required to
increase situational awareness and inform interventions. Mathematical modeling based on
dynamic equations [28; 29; 30] may provide detailed mechanism for the disease dynamics.
A few studies were based on the Colombia COVID-19 situation [31; 32; 33; 34]. These
studies have broadly suggested that control measures could reduce the burden of COVID19. However, none of the studies has considered awareness as a control utilizing recent
epidemic data from the Colombia.
The main objectives of this study are to (i) propose and analyze a compartmental
model incorporating prosocial awareness, (ii) use available current COVID-19 epidemic
from Colombia and calibrate the proposed model and (iii) compare prosocial awareness
with other popular control measures in Colombia.
Rest of the paper is organized as follows: A mathematical model which incorporates
the prosocial awareness is described in Section 2. The equilibrium points of the model
and their stability along with related conditions are presented in Section 3. In Section 4,
the transcritical bifurcation phenomenon is presented between multiple equilibria. Next
in 5, we fit the proposed model to daily new COVID-19 cases and deaths from Colombia.
The impact of prosocial awareness and comparison with other control strategies is also
studied. Finally in Section 6, we discuss the results from our study.
2. Model formulation
A compartmental differential equation model for COVID-19 is formulated and analyzed. We adopt a variant that reflects some key epidemiological properties of COVID19. The model monitors the dynamics of six sub-populations, namely unaware susceptible (Su (t)), aware susceptible (Sa (t)), exposed (E(t)), un-notified infected (I(t)),
notified infected (J(t)) and recovered (R(t)) individuals. The total population size is
3

N(t) = Su (t) + Sa (t) + E(t) + I(t) + J(t) + R(t). Our model incorporates some demographic effects by assuming a proportional natural death rate µ > 0 in each of the
six sub-populations of the model. In addition, our model includes a net inflow of susceptible individuals into the region at a rate Π per unit time. This parameter includes
new births, immigration and emigration. Instead of constant awareness rate, we consider
that the awareness will induce a behavioral response in the person and this person will
transmit the knowledge to other hosts [35; 36]. Thus, unaware suscptibles can become
aware through contact with aware susceptibles. The functional response in this regard is
assumed to be αSNu Sa .
The flow diagram of the proposed model is displayed in Fig. 1.

Both susceptible populations decrease due to infection through successful contact with
infectives who may be notified or un-notified. Note that un-notified class contains both
asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals. We assume that the transmission
co-efficient is less for notified individuals as they are kept in special observations. Thus,
[37]. On the other hand
a reduced risk for notified COVID-19 patients is modelled as βνJ
N
for un-notified individuals, the standard mixing force of infection is formulated as βI
[38].
N
By making successful contact with infectives both susceptible group members become exposed to the disease. The exposed population may become notified or un-notified at a
rates pγ and (1 − p)γ respectively. The recovery rate of un-notified and notified infected
individuals are σ1 and σ2 respectively. The un-notified COVID-19 patients become notified at a rate η. The mortality rates related to COVID-19 are assumed to be δ1 and
4

δ2 for un-notified and notified persons respectively. From the above considerations, the
following system of ordinary differential equations governs the dynamics of the system:

3. Model analysis
3.1. Positivity and boundedness of the solution
This subsection is provided to prove the positivity and boundedness of solutions of
the system (2.1) with following initial conditions
(Su (0), Sa (0), E(0), I(0), J(0), R(0))T ∈ R6+ .

(3.1)

Proposition 3.1. The system (2.1) is invariant in R6+ .
Proof. Consider initial conditions (3.1) and let Su becomes zero at time t1 before other
state variables become zero, then
dSu
|S =0 = Π + θSa ≥ 0,
dt u
at t1 . This shows that Su is a non-decreasing function of time at t1 . Hence it follows
that Su stays non-negative (similar argument is employed in Theorem 3.1 of Sun et al.

Thus we obtain non-negativity of all the six state variables and it follows that R6+ is an
invariant set for the model (2.1).
Proposition 3.2. The system (2.1) is bounded in the region
Ω = {(Su , Sa , E, I, J, R) ∈ R6+ |Su + Sa + E + I + J + R ≤ Πµ }
6

Proof. Adding all the equations of the model (2.1), total human populations satisfy the
following equations,
dN
= Π − µN − δ1 I − δ2 J ≤ Π − µN
dt
Since dN
≤ Π−µN, it follows that dN
≤ 0 if N ≥ Πµ . Thus, by using standard comparison
dt
dt
theorem, it can be shown that N ≤ N(0)e−µt + Πµ (1 − e−µt ). In particular, N(t) ≤ Πµ if
N(0) ≤ Πµ . Thus, the region Ω is positively-invariant. Further, if N(0) > Πµ , then either
the solution enters Ω in finite time, or N(t) approaches Πµ asymptotically. Hence, the
region Ω attracts all solutions in R6+ .
3.2. Equilibrium points, threshold quantities and stability analysis
The system (2.1) has four type of equilibrium points: awareness-free disease-free
equilibrium (AFDFE), disease free equilibrium (DFE), awareness-free endemic equilibrium (AFEE) and endemic equilibrium (EE). The awareness free, DFE is given by
E0 = ( Πµ , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).

free, DFE E0 of system (2.1) is locally asymptotically stable

Let λ be the eigenvalue of the matrix JE0 . Then the characteristic equation is given
by det(JE0 − λI) = 0.
Clearly, −µ, −µ and α − (µ + θ) are three eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix JE0 .
The other three eigenvalues are given the following cubic equation

Proof. The system (2.1) can be represented as

where X = (Su , Sa , R) ∈ R3+ (uninfected classes of people), V = (E, I, J) ∈ R3+ (infected
classes of people), and E0 = ( Πµ , 0, 0, 0, 0) is the awareness free, DFE of the system (2.1).
The global stability of E0 is guaranteed if the following two conditions are satisfied:
1. For

where B = DV G1 (X ∗ , 0) is a Metzler matrix and Ω̂ is the positively invariant set with
respect to the model (2.1). Following Castillo-Chavez et al [48], we check for aforementioned conditions.

The basic reproduction number R0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases

population. The basic reproduction number R0 of (2.1) given in 3.3.
Using Theorem 2 in [49], the following result is established.
Lemma 3.2. The disease-free equilibrium ε0 of system (2.1) is locally asymptotically
stable whenever R0 < 1, and unstable whenever R0 > 1.
Remark 3.1. Note that the threshold quantities R1 and R0 are linearly dependent by the

(E(t), I(t), J(t)) → (0, 0, 0) as t → ∞

Since lim supI(t) = 0 and lim supJ(t) = 0 (from 3.4), it follows that, for sufficiently

small ξ1 > 0, ξ2 > 0, there exist constants L1 > 0, L2 > 0 such that lim supI(t) ≤ ξ1 for

all t > L1 and lim supJ(t) ≤ ξ2 for all t > L2 .
t→∞
Hence, it follows that,

Therefore using comparison theorem [51]
R∞ = lim supR(t) ≤

Therefore, as (ξ1 , ξ2 ) → (0, 0), R∞ = lim supR(t) ≤ 0

Similarly by using lim inf I(t) = 0 and lim inf J(t) = 0, it can be shown that

R∞ = lim inf R(t) ≥ 0

Thus, it follows from above two relations

Hence lim R(t) = 0

4. Numerical bifurcation analysis
In this section, various possibilities of forward transcritical bifurcations are examined
based on the stability analysis of the four equilibrium points of the model (2.1). To do
the numerical experiments, the initial conditions are assumed to be,
N = 10000, Su(0) = 0.9 × N,
Sa (0) = 100, E(0) = 100,
I(0) = 10, J(0) = 10, R(0) = 0.
The fixed parameters used in this section are as follows: Π = µ×N, ν = 0.05, γ = 0.1,
η = 0.01, σ1 = 0.05, σ2 = 0.01, p = 0.2, δ1 = 0.01 and δ2 = 0.003.
From the stability analysis of the equilibia E0 and E1 , it can be inferred that the E0
will become unstable after a certain threshold of α namely µ+θ whenever R1 < 1. In this
region when α > µ + θ, the DFE will become LAS whenever R0 < 1. This phenomenon is
depicted in Fig. 2(a). This type of phenomenon is called forward transcritical bifurcation
where the two equilibrium points switch their stability at a critical value.
Further, the forward transcritical bifurcation between the equilibria E0 and E2 is
depicted in Fig. 2(b). The reason behind this result is that the existence of E2 depend
on the threshold quantity R1 of E0 . This result indicate that depending on parameter
values, the awareness free, DFE can become unstable and one of E1 or E2 will become
stable.
Furthermore, the forward transcritical bifurcation between the equilibria E1 and E3
is depicted in Fig. 2(c). The reason behind this result is that the existence of E3 depend
on the threshold quantity R0 of E1 . This result indicate that depending on parameter
values, the DFE can become unstable and E3 will become stable.

5. Case study on Colombia COVID-19 data
5.1. Data description
As of August, 28th 2020, there were more than 590 thousand cases and above 18
thousand deaths in Colombia. Daily COVID-19 notified cases and deaths of Colombia
for the time period March 19th , 2020 to August 24th , 2020 is considered for our study.
These 159 days COVID-19 notified cases and deaths were collected from [6]. We use the
first 149 data points to calibrate the unknown model parameters. In this time period,
COVID-19 cases and deaths both display a upward trend for Colombia. This is an
alarming situation as the pandemic continue to affect the country. This is why we chose
Colombia for the case study. However, we use the remaining 10 data points to check the
accuracy of the fitted model. The demographic parameter values and initial conditions
for fitting the proposed model to data are given in Table 3.

5.2. Model calibration
We fit the model (2.1) to daily new notified cases of COVID-19 for Colombia. Fixed
parameters of the model (2.1) are given in Table 1. The demographic parameters related
to Colombia and initial condition are reported in Table 3. We estimate three unknown
model parameters such as: (a) the transmission rate of infected individuals (β), (b) (α)
and (c) (δ2 ) by fitting the model to newly daily reported cases. Additionally, two initial
conditions of the model (2.1) were also estimated from the data, namely initial number of
exposed individuals E(0) and initial number of un-notified individuals I(0). During the
specified time period, nonlinear least square solver lsqnonlin (in MATLAB) is used to fit
simulated daily data to the reported COVID-19 cases and deaths in Colombia. We used
Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis algorithm [53] to generate the 95% confidence
region. An explanation of this technique for model fitting is given in [54]. The estimated
parameters are given in Table 4. The fitting of the daily new notified COVID-19 cases
and deaths of Colombia is displayed in Fig. 3.

Figure 3: Model (2.1) fitting to daily notified COVID-19 cases and notified deaths due to COVID-19 in
Colombia. Daily notified cases (deaths) are depicted in red dots and purple curve is the model simulation.
The blue dots are test data points in both panels. Grey shaded region is the 95% confidence region.

Using test data points (August 15th , 2020 to August 24th , 2020), we calculate two
accuracy metrics for these 10 test data points: Root mean squared error (RMSE) and
mean absolute error (MAE). For the case fitting, we found that RMSE=2031.5 and
MAE=1491.1. On the other hand for fitting COVID-19 deaths, RMSE=137.08 and
MAE=125.05 are found. This indicate that the fitting are quite good for both scenarios.
Finally, we estimate the basic reproduction number (R0 ), for the proposed model (2.1).
We draw 1000 samples of the estimated parameters from their posterior distribution
obtained from the MCMC run and put them in the expression of R0 . All the fixed
parameters are taken from the Table 1 and Table 3. Estimated values of R0 is found to
be 0.7815 with 95% confidence interval (0.7633 – 0.8014).
5.3. Sensitivity analysis
We performed global sensitivity analysis to identify most influential parameters with
respect to the total deaths due to COVID-19 in 6 months time frame (starting from
March, 19th 2020). Let us denote by Dtotal the total number notified and un-notified
deaths due to COVID-19. Partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCCs) are calculated
and plotted in Fig. 4. Nonlinear and monotone relationship were observed for the
parameters with respect to Dtotal , which is a prerequisite for performing PRCC analysis.
Following Marino et. al [55], we calculate PRCCs for the parameters β, α, θ, ν, ǫ, δ1 , δ2
and η. The following response function is used to calculate the PRCC values
Z T
Dtotal =
[δ1 I(t) + δ2 J(t)]dt,

where T=180 days (chosen arbitrarily). The base values for the parameters β, α and
δ2 are taken as the mean of estimated parameters reported in Table 4. The other base

Colombia. Parameters with significant PRCC indicated as ∗ (p-value < 0.05). The fixed parameters are
taken from Table 1.

values are taken as the fixed values displayed in Table 1. For each of the parameters,
500 Latin Hypercube Samples were generated from the interval (0.5 × base value, 1.5 ×
base value).
It is observed that the parameters β, ν, δ1 , θ and δ2 have significant positive correlations with Dtotal . This indicates that transmission rate of COVID-19 will increase
the total number deaths related to COVID-19. Besides, modification factor for notified
patients and death rate of un-notified patients are positively correlated with Dtotal . On
the other hand, the learning factor related to aware susceptibles has significant negative
correlation with the response variable. These results reinforces the fact that β, ν and α
are very crucial for reduction of COVID-19 cases in Colombia.
5.4. Future projections and control scenarios
In this section, we focus on four controllable parameters namely learning factor related
to aware susceptibles (α), transmission rate (β), modification factor for notified patients
or equivalently the efficacy of notified case containment (ν) and reduction in transmission
co-efficient for aware susceptibles (ǫ). Transmission rate of COVID-19 can be reduced by
social distancing, face mask use, PPE kit use and through use of alcohol based hand wash
[40; 4]. The parameters ν and ǫ can also be reduced through effective management of
notified cases and through increased behavioral changes by aware susceptible respectively.
On the other hand, α should be increased to reduce the burden of COVID-19 in the
18

society. It can be increased if the aware people show more pro-social activities. However,
the results from global sensitivity analysis suggest that β is most effective in terms of
reduction in total COVID-19 related deaths. The parameters α and ν were also found
significant with respect to the response function. Now we visualize the impacts of these
four parameters on the un-notified and notified COVID-19 cases in Colombia. Using
the estimated parameters (see Table 4) we predict un-notified and notified infections in
the coming 5 months (150 days) starting from August 15th , 2020. The baseline curve
is determined by simulating the model with fixed parameters from Table 1 and mean
values of estimated parameters from Table 4. For different values of α, β, ν and ǫ, the
case reduction in COVID-19 cases is depicted in Fig. 5 and 6.

It can be observed that all the four controllable parameters show similar trends in case
reduction. However, β and ǫ are showing sharp decay in cases. Note that the scales of case
reductions in the Figs. 5 and 6 are similar, but we cannot quantify the effectiveness of
the parameters. Therefore, we calculate percentage reductions in un-notified and notified
COVID-19 cases in Colombia, Table 5. The fixed parameter values are taken from Table

From Table 5, it can be argued that β is most effective in reduction of COVID-19
cases. Maximum reduction in ǫ (=0.1) can reduce notified COVID-19 cases upto 45.65%.
Learning factor related to aware susceptibles (α) also has competitive potential to reduce
the COVID-19 cases in the community.
6. Discussion and conclusion
This paper provides a deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of COVID19 outbreak incorporating prosocial behaviour. The model, which adopts standard incidence functions in a realistic way, allows COVID-19 to be transmitted by un-notified and

notified individuals. To gain insight into its dynamic features, the model was rigorously
analyzed. The findings obtained are as follows. There are four type of equilibrium points
of the proposed model: awareness free, disease free equilibrium (E0 ), disease free equilibrium (E1 ), awareness free endemic equilibrium (E2 ) and endemic equilibrium point
(E3 ). The awareness free, disease free equilibrium is found to be globally asymptotically
α
stable under a parametric condition ((max{R1 , θ+µ
} < 1)). The basic reproduction number (R0 ) for the proposed model is calculated using the next-generation matrix method.
The model has a locally-stable disease-free equilibrium whenever the basic reproduction
number is less than unity. The global stability condition for the DFE is also presented
using Lyapunov function. The existence and stability criterion of these four equilibria
are presented in Table 2. Further, the two threshold quantities R1 and R0 are linearly
dependent on each other by the relation R0 = m3 R1 . Using a hypothetical parameter
set, we show the stability switch or transcritical bifurcation between E0 and E1 (see Fig.
2(a)). Also, transcritical bifurcations are observed between the equilibria E0 and E2 (see
Fig. 2(b)) and between E1 and E3 (see Fig. 2(c)).
We calibrated the proposed model parameters to fit Colombia’s daily cases and death
data during the time period of March 19th , 2020 to August 14th , 2020. Using test data
points (August 15th , 2020 to August 14th , 2020), we found that RMSE=2031.5 and
MAE=1491.1 for notified case fitting and for fitting COVID-19 deaths, RMSE=137.08
and MAE=125.05 are found. Thus, the fitting is pretty good for actual data in the
study period. Using estimated parameters, the basic reproduction number is found to
be 0.7815 with 95% confidence interval (0.7633 – 0.8014). Which indicate the success
of Colombian government in containing this deadly disease. This is also reflected on
21

the current decreasing phase of the notified cases of COVID-19 in Colombia. Global
sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to the total number of COVID-19 related
deaths. Results indicate that transmission rate (β), modification factor (ν) and learning
factor related to awareness of susceptibles (α) are very crucial for reduction in disease
related deaths. We have also investigated the impact of four controllable parameters
on the prevalence of un-notified and notified COVID-19 cases. From Fig. 5 and 6, it
can be observed that different level of controls can significantly reduce the burden of
COVID-19 from community. However, to better quantify the impacts, we calculate the
percentage reduction using a simple formula. This reveals that reduction in transmission
rate is most effective in reducing un-notified and notified COVID-19 caese (see Table 5).
Increase in the learning factor (α) has competitive potential to flatten the curve. This
finding reinforces the need for amplified campaigns and awareness made by individual
aware susceptible persons. Prosocial behavior is needed to combat this highly infectious
pandemic disease. Along with verified control strategies, the governments should promote
prosocial awareness by aware people. This will definitely benefit the case reduction as
well as management of future COVID-19 cases.
