In this paper, we introduce an optimization problem posed by the Music Building Eindhoven (MBE) to
deal with the economical consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for theatre halls. We propose a model
for maximizing the number of guests in a theatre hall that respects social distancing rules, and is based on
trapezoid packings. Computational results show that up to 40% of the normal capacity can be used for a
single show setting, and up to 70 % in case artists opt for two consecutive performances per evening.
Key words : Integer programming; COVID-19

Prologue

All around the world, the corona-crisis has hit the cultural sector hard. Festivals are cancelled, orchestra’s are at the brink of bankruptcy, choirs have stopped performing, and
theatres are struggling to survive. Different countries, or regions, have imposed different
rules in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. We do not aim here to overview the
precise (dynamic!) contents of all these rules, and their impact on the cultural sector;
a number of descriptions of such rules and their impact can be found on governmental
websites (e.g. [Australia (2020)], [Germany (2020)], [Sweden (2020)], [UK (2020)] and
[USA (2020)]), and in other contributions (such as [Jacobs (2020)]).
The situation in the Netherlands is not atypical from other countries or regions. Starting
March 12, 2020 until June 1, 2020 all performances were cancelled or suspended. From June
1 onwards, a relaxation of the rules has allowed performances with at most thirty guests,
as long as non-family members were seated at least 1.5 meters apart. The upper bound on
the number of guests for indoor performances was eventually increased to one hundred on
July 1, 2020; a description of the current rules can be found at [The Netherlands (2020)].

Clearly, these rules have a dramatic impact on the operation of any theatre, and despite
governmental efforts theatres are struggling to survive. As a consequence, many employees
in this sector risk losing their jobs.
Indeed, for many theatres, the challenge is to find a way to welcome their guests while
satisfying the distance rules, and still be commercially viable. Many creative efforts have
resulted in a number of ideas that are being experimented with (see, for example, the use of
a so-called nebulizer device, see [Berliner Ensemble (2020)]). Here, we focus on the question
to what extent large audiences can still be accommodated in a theatre when distance rules
must be satisfied. We describe a mathematical model that, given the layout of the seats in
a theatre and the distribution of the demand, computes a safe seating arrangement that
attains the maximum occupation of the theatre.
The Music Building Eindhoven (MBE), located in the city of Eindhoven in the Netherlands, features a “Grand Room” (1250 seats) and a “Small Room” (400 seats). This theatre
has served as a motivation for this study, and all our computational efforts are based on
its two rooms. Our findings have been implemented by the MBE, allowing them to remain
open.
In Section 2 we give a precise problem description, and in Section 3 we phrase the
problem in terms of packing of trapezoids. In Section 4 we give our model, and in Section 5
we show solutions of the model on instances coming from the MBE. Upper bounds are
discussed in Section 6, and we conclude in Section 7.

Problem description

Here, we describe the crucial ingredients of our problem. Seats, distances and forbidden
zones are discussed in Section 2.1, and target profiles are explained in Section 2.2. This
allows us to arrive at a problem statement given in Section 2.3.
2.1.

Seats, distances and forbidden zones

When a theatre wants to offer a corona-proof experience to its customers, a few constraints
need to be taken into account. Obviously, safety is of utmost importance and therefore,
the subset of seats that could be used for reservations needs to be chosen according to the
guidelines provided by the government. We realize that these guidelines vary for different
countries. However, a common denominator between different countries is that members of
distinct families (or bubbles) should keep a prespecified distance from each other to prevent

the spread of the COVID-19 virus. In the Netherlands, two people should be seated at
least 1.5 meter apart (unless they are members from the same household), as established
by the Dutch Government [The Netherlands (2020)].
Figure 1 shows a sketch of four consecutive seats, viewed from the front and from above,
and the corresponding interseat distances of seats in the MBE.

consecutive rows is 0.31m, due to acoustics and visibility reasons.

Due to the exception of the distance rules for family members, another relevant factor
is the size t ∈ T of a family, with T ⊂ Z+ the set of allowed family sizes. In particular, we
will call a family of size 1 a singleton, of size 2 a pair, of size 3 a triple, and a family of size
4 a quad. Guests from the same household are allowed to sit next to each other, within the
1.5m bound; in fact, we assume that a family of size t occupies t consecutive seats. Based
on the distances in Figure 1, it follows that whenever a certain seat is occupied, there is
a “ring” of seats around it that are forbidden for use by a member of another family. The
forbidden ring corresponding to a pair is depicted in red in Figure 2.
Consider a theatre, and let S denote the set of seats of the theatre. Each seat is specified
by its row r, and its position s in row r. Formally, a seat is a pair of integers (r, s) ∈
Z × Z and the set of seats is a collection S ⊆ Z × Z. Typically, the seats in each row are
numbered starting with s = 1, 2, 3, . . ., so that the relative position of the seats (r, s) and
(r0 , s) will depend on where rows r and r0 start. For the description of our model it will be
convenient to assume that the seats in each row are numbered such that for each s ∈ Z,
the seats {(r, s) ∈ S : r ∈ Z} are in a straight line. Figure 2 also illustrates this convention
for {(r, 3) ∈ S : r ∈ Z}.

Again, in a typical theatre (such as MBE), consecutive rows are shifted relative to each
other (for reasons of visibility), so that the four seats (r + 1, s − 1), (r + 1, s), (r − 1, s), (r −
1, s + 1) form the corners of a rectangle with center (r, s). This seat renumbering method
is illustrated in Figure 2 for (r, s) = (3, 3).
When we denote the distance between the centers of adjacent seats in a row by a, and
the spacing of consecutive rows is denoted by b, then the distance between the centers of
seats (r, s) and (r0 , s0 ) is
s
2
1
0 0
d((r, s), (r , s )) =
(s − s0 + (r − r0 ) a2 + (r − r0 )2 b2 .

Assuming that members of different families may not be seated within distance c, the
‘forbidden zone’ for members of other families surrounding a person in seat (0, 0) is
F := {(r, s) : d((r, s), (0, 0)) < c}.
Taking distances a = 0.51m and b = 0.95m as in Figure 1, and a forbidden distance of
c = 1.5m, a calculation reveals that F is a collection of 13 seats: the occupied seat itself,
two seats on each side in in the same row, and four nearby seats in each adjacent row. In
general, the forbidden zone for a family of size t consists of 13 + 2(t − 1) = 2t + 11 seats.
In Figure 2, we indeed see that the forbidden zone of a pair consists of 15 seats, as there
is an extra forbidden seat in both adjacent rows.
Figure 2

The red seats cannot be occupied whenever the green seats are occupied by a pair. The seats with seat
number 3 in consecutive rows are situated on a straight line. This example is based on the measures
of the MBE.

The forbidden zone surrounding each other seat (r, s) is just a shifted version of this
forbidden zone around (0, 0):
Fr,s := {(r, s)} + F = {(r + r0 , s + s0 ) : (r0 , s0 ) ∈ F}.

Members of the same family are allowed to be in each other’s forbidden zone, but the
union of their forbidden zones is forbidden for members of other families. A family of size
t located at (r, s) will occupy the seats Sr,s,t := {(r, s + i) : i = 0, . . . , t − 1)} and will have a
forbidden zone
Fr,s,t := Sr,s,t + F = {(r + r0 , s + s0 + i) : i = 0, . . . , t − 1, (r0 , s0 ) ∈ F}.
(Notice that we use the Minkowski sum when adding two sets A and B, i.e. A + B =
{a + b : a ∈ A, b ∈ B}.) A subset A ⊆ S × T is a seating arrangement if each (r, s, t) ∈ A
indicates a possible location of a family of size t at (r, s), i.e. if Sr,s,t ⊆ S for each (r, s, t) ∈ A
and Sr,s,t ∩ Sr0 ,s0 ,t0 = ∅ for each distinct pair (r, s, t), (r0 , s0 , t0 ) ∈ A.
Definition 1. A seating arrangement A is safe if
Sr,s,t ∩ Fr0 ,s0 ,t0 = ∅
for each distinct pair (r, s, t), (r0 , s0 , t0 ) ∈ A.
Thus, a seating arrangement A is safe if no member of a family is in the forbidden zone of
another family.
For any seating arrangement A, let nt (A) := |{(r, s, t) ∈ A : (r, s) ∈ S}| capture the number of families of size t in A, t ∈ T .
Definition 2. The size of a seating arrangement A is

P

t∈T

t · nt (A).

Thus, the size of a seating arrangement corresponds to the number of customers present.
2.2.

Target profiles

Apart from providing a safe environment for the audience while enjoying a performance,
a theatre needs to consider its booking strategy. In general, multiple factors play a role
when deciding upon such a strategy (see Baldin and Bille [Baldin and Bille (2018)], and
the references contained therein). One option is to sell the individual seats (perhaps after
segmentation into classes) chosen by customers in a first-come first-serve manner. The risk
of such a strategy is that customers choose seats that do not lead to a maximum occupancy.
Another option is to simply sell tickets, and only reveal very shortly before the start of
the performance which particular seats are assigned to which individual customers. This
allows the theatre flexibility to find a maximum occupancy, yet customers might find it
unattractive not to be able to choose their specific seats. Without going into details of

the various considerations, we have opted, in collaboration with the MBE for a policy
that (i) allows customers to choose their seats, and (ii) uses a so-called target profile to
take the size of families visiting the performance into account. Indeed, prior information
on the distribution of the customers over singletons, pairs, triples and quads is valuable
information and can serve as a proxy for customer behaviour.
Definition 3. A target profile for a seating arrangement A is a vector p~ = (pt )t∈T ∈
P
[0, 1]T such that t∈T pt = 1.
Each entry pt indicates a targeted proportion of the reservations corresponding to families
of size t, i.e. we aim for a seating arrangement A for which

P

nt (A)
≈ pt ,
t0 ∈T nt0 (A)

∀t ∈ T.

(1)

A target profile can be determined through statistical analysis or machine learning models applied on historical data. We show in Section 2.3 how we formalize this aim.
2.3.

Problem statement

When we use the target profile to proxy customer behaviour as input, we can describe the
problem in the following way:

Problem: MAXIMUM PROFILED SEATING ARRANGEMENT
Instance: a tuple (S, T, p~, ) consisting of a set of seats S ⊆ Z × Z, a set of allowed family
sizes T ⊂ N+ , a target profile p~ = (pt )t∈T and  ∈ (0, 1].
Goal: Find a safe seating arrangement A of maximum size such that the following
conditions hold:
(pt − )

X
t0 ∈T

nt0 (A) ≤ nt (A) ≤ (pt + )

X

nt0 (A),

∀t ∈ T.

t0 ∈T

Notice that there is no unique way to model a condition as provided in Equation (1).
One alternative is to consider strict lower bounds on the number nt (A) of families of size t.
Furthermore,  is used as a multiplicative threshold parameter, but one could also use it as
an additional parameter instead. In the following section, we describe a nontrivial connection between finding a safe seating arrangement and the problem of packing a maximum
weight set of trapezoids.

Trapezoid packings

We describe in Section 3.1 a nontrivial connection between finding a safe seating arrangement and the problem of packing a maximum number of trapezoids in a polygonal shape,
and in Section 3.2 we prove a bound on the number of families that fit in a theatre. In
Section 3.3 we analyze, as an intermezzo, a theatre with an infinite number of rows having
each an infinite number of seats, and in Section 3.4 we discuss the occupation density of
seating arrangements in large theatres.
3.1.

From safe seating arrangements to trapezoid packings

Given the structure of the forbidden zone F, we are able to formulate a model based on
trapezoids. The trapezoid based at (0, 0) is the collection of seats
T := {(0, −1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, −1), (1, 0)}.
The trapezoid based at (r, s) then is
Tr,s := {(r, s)} + T = {(r + u, s + v) : (u, v) ∈ T },
and the trapezoid of a family of size t located at (r, s) is
Tr,s,t := Sr,s,t + T = {(r + u, s + v + i) : i = 0, . . . , t − 1, (u, v) ∈ T }.

The trapezoid T is chosen so that
F = T + (−T ),

where T + (−T ) := {(u, v) − (u0 , v 0 ) : (u, v), (u0 , v 0 ) ∈ T }. This key property will allow us to
show:

Theorem 1. Let A ⊆ S × T be a seating arrangement. Then A is safe if and only if
{Tr,s,t : (r, s, t) ∈ A}
is a collection of pairwise disjoint trapezoids.
Theorem 1 forms the basis of the integer programming models in Section 4, which solve
the main problem of this paper for the MBE, and which in principle apply to theatres S of
any given shape or irregular form. Theorem 1 also enables us to analyse, in the remainder
of this section, the limiting behaviour of optimal arrangements for large ’square’ theatres.
The proof of Theorem 1 takes the form of 2 lemma’s.
Lemma 1. Let (r, s), (r0 , s0 ) ∈ S. Then (r, s) ∈ Fr0 ,s0 ⇐⇒ Tr,s ∩ Tr0 ,s0 6= ∅.
Proof. Necessity: Suppose (r, s) ∈ Fr0 ,s0 . Since Fr0 ,s0 = (r0 , s0 ) + F = (r0 , s0 ) + T + (−T )
by (2), it follows that there are (u, v), (u0 , v 0 ) ∈ T so that (r, s) = (r0 , s0 ) + (u0 , v 0 ) − (u, v).
Then
Tr,s 3 (r, s) + (u, v) = (r0 , s0 ) + (u0 , v 0 ) ∈ Tr0 ,s0 ,
so that Tr,s ∩ Tr0 ,s0 6= ∅, as required.
Sufficiency: Suppose Tr,s ∩ Tr0 ,s0 6= ∅. Then (r, s) + (u, v) = (r0 , s0 ) + (u0 , v 0 ) for some
(u, v), (u0 , v 0 ) ∈ T . Then (r, s) = (r0 , s0 ) + (u0 , v 0 ) − (u, v) ∈ (r, s) + T + (−T ) = Fr0 ,s0 , as
required. 
Lemma 2. Let (r, s, t), (r0 , s0 , t0 ) ∈ S × T . Then
Sr,s,t ∩ Fr0 ,s0 ,t0 6= ∅ ⇐⇒ Tr,s,t ∩ Tr0 ,s0 ,t0 6= ∅.
Proof. We have Sr,s,t ∩ Fr0 ,s0 ,t0 6= ∅ if and only if there are i ∈ {0, . . . , t − 1}, i0 ∈ {0, . . . , t0 −
1} so that (r, s + i) ∈ Fr0 ,s0 +i0 . By the previous lemma, this is equivalent to
Tr,s+i ∩ Tr0 ,s0 +i0 6= ∅ for some i ∈ {0, . . . , t − 1}, i0 ∈ {0, . . . , t0 − 1}.
In turn, this is equivalent to Tr,s,t ∩ Tr0 ,s0 ,t0 6= ∅. 
By this lemma, we may replace the asymmetrical condition Sr,s,t ∩ Fr0 ,s0 ,t0 = ∅ in the
definition of a safe arrangement by the equivalent symmetrical condition Tr,s,t ∩ Tr0 ,s0 ,t0 = ∅.
This proves Theorem 1.

A volume bound

Under normal circumstances, it is clear how guests of a theatre use the available resources:
each guest needs one seat. With social distancing rules, it is not immediately clear to what
extent guests claim the resources. There will be many empty seats in any safe seating
arrangement, and it is not obvious which guest to blame or charge. Theorem 1 is helpful
in this sense, as it makes clear that each family with t members at (r, s) blocks the seats
Tr,s,t ∩ S, and so is responsible at least for the emptiness of these seats. If (r, s) is sufficiently
far away from the boundary of the theatre, so that Tr,s,t ⊆ S, this amounts to blocking
|Tr,s,t | = 2t + 3 seats. Ignoring the boundary effect, this gives a rough upper bound on the
number of families of size t that can fit the theatre safely: |S|/(2t + 3).
The following consequence of Theorem 1 describes how we may take the boundary of a
collection of seats S into account when estimating the capacity of a theatre.
Theorem 2. Let A be a safe seating arrangement in S. We have:
∞
X

(2t + 3)nt (A) ≤ |S + T |.

t=1

Proof. For each (r, s, t) ∈ A, the family of size t which is located at (r, s) will occupy
the seats Sr,s,t ⊆ S and hence for the corresponding trapezoid we have
Tr,s,t = Sr,s,t + T ⊆ S + T .
By Theorem 1, each seat of S + T is in at most one of trapezoids {Tr,s,t : (r, s, t) ∈ A}, and
hence
|S + T | ≥

|Tr,s,t | =

(r,s,t)∈A

as required.

Note that the set (S + T ) \ S consists of a rim of seats adjacent to the boundary of S in
Z × Z.
For large theatres with a relatively simple boundary, the collection S + T of the theorem
is only marginally larger than S. For example, let S k be a block of k rows of k seats each,
then |S k | = k 2 and |S k + T | ≤ (k + 1)(k + 2). Then

as k → ∞.
We analyse the limiting case of this sequence in Section 3.3, and then we return to
safe arrangements in large theatres S k in Section 3.4. Though the square theatre S k is
perhaps artificial, very large venues such as sport stadiums are sufficiently similar to merit
comparison.

Intermezzo: the Hilbert theatre

Inspired by the famous thought experiment of Hilbert on the concept of infinity, the Hilbert
theatre has seats S ∞ = Z × Z: it is an infinite sea of regularly spaced seats.
For each family size t, the seating arrangement

At := {u(2, −1) + v(1, t + 1) : u, v ∈ Z}

is such that the corresponding collection of trapezoids {Tr,s,t : (r, s, t) ∈ At } covers each seat
in S ∞ exactly once.

We cannot hope to attain a better density than dt in any arrangement with families of size
t. This shows that in the Hilbert theatre, the maximum density when packing families of
size t is dt ; notice that this value increases with t and will never exceed 12 . The following
table shows the density dt and its reciprocal 1/dt for small family sizes t.

The occupation density of large theatres

Finite theatres tend to approximate the Hilbert theatre as they become larger. For a seating
arrangement A in a finite theatre S, we formally define the occupation density as
P

d(A) :=

(r,s,t)∈A

In our square theatre S k , there is a seating arrangement of families of size t which arises
by restricting At to the locations available in S k :
At,k := {(r, s, t) ∈ At : Sr,s,t ⊆ S k }.
k
Then each row of S k will see at least b 2t+3
c families in At,k , and hence At,k attains an

overall density of occupied seats of at least

k
Evidently, this lower bound on the density tends to dt as k → ∞.
For an upper bound on the occupation density of any arrangement A in S k consisting
families of size t only, we may bound the number nt of families in A by applying Theorem 1.
This gives
(2t + 3)nt ≤ |S k + T | ≤ (k + 1)(k + 2).
Since each family has t members and the total number of seats in S k is k 2 , we obtain an
upper bound on the occupation density of

So the occupation density of such A may marginally exceed the density dt of At for low
values of k, but the upper bound tends to dt as k → ∞. In particular, we find that the
density of At,k tends to dt as k → ∞, since both lower and the upper bound converge to
this value. So, the upper bound from Theorem 2 ultimately dictates the maximum density
of arrangements in sufficiently large theatres. This extends to arrangements where the
relative proportion of families of size t is restricted, in the following precise sense. For an
arrangement A of S, let p(A) : N → R record the relative proportion of families of size t:
p(A) : t 7→ nt (A)/|A|.
P
For any p : N → R+ , put D(p) := t pt dt .
Theorem 3. For any safe arrangement A of S, we have
|S + T |
.
d(A) ≤ D(p(A))
|S|
P
Moreover, for any p : N → R+ such that t pt = 1, there exists a sequence of arrangements
Ak of S k such that p(Ak ) → p and d(Ak ) → D(p) as k → ∞.
We omit the proof, noting that it is a straightforward extension of the argumentation
above.

Remark on special seating arrangements The highest possible occupation densities are

attained by arrangements where there are families placed in each row of the theatre (see
Section 5). For comparison, it is interesting to consider safe seating arrangements in S k
where each occupied row is sandwiched between two empty rows. If A is such an arrangement with families of size t, then A is safe if and only if there are two empty seats between
any two families in the same row. Restricting to such simpler arrangements may have
practical advantages. It will be easier to guide guests to their seats, and in fact it becomes
possible to rearrange the order in which families take place in their row on the fly. This may
translate to a lesser need for personnel hosting guests. Also, since safety of an arrangement
depends only on a condition within each row, finding safe arrangements becomes so easy
that it can be done manually or with software applying straightforward strategies. Without
the need to incorporate a ’black box’ advanced solver in the process of selling seats, the
flexibility of this process may be greatly increased.
Let us analyze the densities d0t that can be obtained for such special seating arrangements
for a fixed t. Since A will have dk/2e occupied rows, we have
d0t (1 − o(1)) =

1 k k+2

as k → ∞, where d0t := t/(2t + 4). This is worse than dt = t/(2t + 3), but not by much.
To assess the loss of density when using these special seating arrangements, we include
a table with the densities d0t , the inverse densities 1/d0t , and the relative densities d0t /dt .

Remark on a shorter safe distance The above analysis can be straightforwardly adapted to

a safe distance of 1 meter. Then the forbidden zone becomes
F := {(−1, 0), (−1, 1), (0, −1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, −1), (1, 0)}.
Taking T := {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)} we will again have F = T + (−T ), i.e. (2). Then Theorem
1 holds, and we obtain |Tr,s,t | = 2t + 1 for each t ∈ N and

There are safe seating arrangements in the Hilbert theatre that attain this density, and
Theorem 3 remains valid. For suboptimal seating arrangements with empty rows between
t
occupied rows, we obtain the densities d0t = 2t+2
.

We have so far used our model to investigate a square and sufficiently large theatre
S k . We will next explain how our model yields a computational strategy to find optimal
packings for any specific theatre.

An integer programming model to maximize the size of a seating
arrangement

We describe our model in Section 4.1, and in Section 4.2 we show how the concept of
multiple shows can be embedded in the model. In Section 4.3 we indicate how we speed
up the solution process of the model.
4.1.

Building the model

With any collection A ⊆ S × T , where T ⊆ N+ is a finite collection of allowed family sizes,
we can associate a characteristic vector y ∈ {0, 1}S×T with yr,s,t = 1 if and only if (r, s, t) ∈ A.
Then A is a seating arrangement in S if and only if
yr,s,t = 0

whenever Sr,s,t 6⊆ S.

(3)

This seating arrangement A is safe if and only if
X

yr0 ,s0 ,t0 ≤ 1,

for all (r, s) ∈ S + T .

(4)

(r0 ,s0 ,t0 ):Tr0 ,s0 ,t0 3(r,s)

From a geometric point of view, constraints (4) ensure that each seat (r, s) ∈ S + T is
covered by at most one of the trapezoids it is contained in. Finally, A accommodates nt
families of each size t ∈ T if
X

yr,s,t = nt ,

for each t ∈ T.

(5)

(r,s):Sr,s,t ⊆S

Thus, the feasibility of a safe seating arrangement that simultaneously accommodates nt
families of size t for t ∈ T translates to an integer linear feasibility problem in variables
yr,s,t and nt . However, without a priori conditions on the number of families of each size t,
the optimal solutions of this problem will tend towards including many large families and
few small families. This is intuitively clear, since a family of t together ’wastes’ a trapezoid

of 2t + 3 seats, so that 2 + 3/t(= 1/dt ) seats are taken per person in a family of size t. In
the extreme case that T includes large enough sizes to fill entire rows of seats with a single
family, then a solution where the even rows are empty and each odd row is filled with a
single family is feasible, and similar for leaving the odd rows empty and filling the even
rows. One of these solutions then is optimal, and uses at least half of the seats in S. Indeed,
now that we are letting our imagination roam free, we can fill the entire theatre with a
single large enough family if we also let go of our restriction that families must be seated
in the same row. To ensure that we find safe seating arrangements that approximately
correspond to the typical sizes of families that book seats for a performance, we use the
target profile, as introduced in Section 2.2. Recall from the problem statement that the
target profile imposes the condition
(pt − )

X

nt ≤ nt ≤ (pt + )

X

t∈T

nt ,

for each t ∈ T.

(6)

t∈T

In this way we obtain an integer linear program that maximizes the size of a seating
arrangement over all safe seating arrangements in S:

max

(
X

)
tnt : (3), (4), (5), (6), y ∈ {0, 1}S×T , n ∈ ZT

.

(7)

t∈T

Notice that the LP relaxation of (7) gives an upper bound which, by the safety constraints (4), is informed that each family of size t occupies at least 2t + 3 seats from S + T .
Evaluated with  = 0, the LP relaxation will be at least as good as the bound of Theorem
3.
4.2.

Consecutive shows

One of the ideas that the MBE has implemented to remain commercially viable is to
perform the same show during the same evening twice, each time for a different audience.
We refer to this phenomenon as consecutive shows. Clearly, this puts a burden on the
performing artist(s); in many cases however, this is a realistic option. The MBE, however, is
not able to clean the seats in between the shows. This creates an interdependence between
the two seating arrangements for each individual show as each seat can be used at most
once in each of the two seating arrangements.

16

However, it is relatively straightforward to extend our model to find k consecutive seating
arrangements Av for v ∈ V = {1, . . . , k}, k ∈ Z+ , so that no seat is used in two different
arrangements, i.e. if v, v 0 ∈ V are distinct, then
Sr,s,t ∩ Sr0 ,s0 ,t0 = ∅
for all (r, s, t) ∈ Av and (r0 , s0 , t0 ) ∈ Av0 .
To model the problem of finding such consecutive seating arrangements, we use binary
variables y ∈ {0, 1}S×T ×V , and integer variables n ∈ ZT . The condition that each Av is a
seating arrangement of S becomes
yr,s,t,v = 0,

whenever Sr,s,t 6⊆ S.

(8)

Safety of each Av is modelled by
X

yr0 ,s0 ,t0 ,v ≤ 1,

for all (r, s) ∈ S + T , v ∈ V.

(9)

(r0 ,s0 ,t0 ):Tr0 ,s0 ,t0 3(r,s)

We also need to ensure that no seat is used more than once.
X

X

yr0 ,s0 ,t0 ,v ≤ 1,

for all (r, s) ∈ S.

(10)

v∈V (r0 ,s0 ,t0 ):Sr0 ,s0 ,t0 3(r,s)

Letting the nt count the overall number of families of size t is accomplished by writing
X X

yr,s,t,v = nt ,

for each t ∈ T.

(11)

v∈V (r,s)∈S

The profiling condition (6) need not change at all.
Maximizing the number of guests in consecutive arrangements in S, whilst respecting a
profile p ∈ RT up to a fixed  > 0, is then modelled as the following ILP:
)
(
X
max
tnt : (6), (8), (9), (10), (11), y ∈ {0, 1}S×T ×V , n ∈ ZT .

(12)

t∈T

This model is rather flexible: many additional wishes can be formulated. For instance,
upper bounds on nt for some t ∈ T , or a balance between the distribution in different shows,
or specific (monetary) weights to maximize the revenue that could be gained, seats can all
be arranged through standard modifications of the integer linear program.

Speeding up the solution process

For some instances of ILP formulation (12), the corresponding LP relaxation leads to long
running times of the solver. Hereunder we propose two methods that ameliorate solver
performance, namely (i) adding a class of valid inequalities to strengthen the LP relaxation
and (ii) using a symmetry breaking method for formulation (12).
Strengthening the linear relaxation

The ILP formulations (7) and (12) only take into account for each individual seat (r, s) ∈ S
the trapezoids Tr0 ,s0 ,t0 that contain (r, s). Using the adjacency of seats, Lemma 3 finds a set
of new valid inequalities.
Lemma 3. Let (r, s) ∈ S such that X = {(r, s), (r + 1, s − 1), (r + 1, s)} ⊆ S. Then, for
each t ∈ T :
X

yr,s,t,v ≤ 1,

v ∈ V.

(13)

(r,s,t):|Tr,s,t ∩X|≥2

Notice that X consists of three seats. Thus, from all trapezoids that contain at least two
seats from X, one can select at most one.
To show that inequalities (13) are valid for nontrivial theatres, consider the example
in Figure 6, where T = {1}, p1 = 1, and V = {1}. The theatre consists of a set S of five
seats, represented by the non-white squares, with the rim of virtual white seats around
it. Each of these four dark grey seats is contained in at most three trapezoids. so the LP
solution with each of the four trapezoids chosen with 1/3 is feasible for (7), with value 4/3.
However, a safe seating arrangement A can clearly contain at most one seat.
Figure 6

A valid inequality for this example is y1,1,1 + y1,2,1 + y2,1,1 + y2,2,1 + y2,3,1 ≤ 1. It separates the previously
feasible LP solution ( 31 , 31 , 13 , 0, 13 ).

Symmetry breaking techniques

The presence of symmetry in a (mixed) integer programming formulation often
poses a computational challenge, see e.g. Margot [Margot (2010)] and Hojny and
Pfetsch [Hojny and Pfetsch (2019)]. Indeed, naive implementations can be unsuccessful, as

18

Blom, Pendavingh, and Spieksma: Filling a theatre in times of corona
Article submitted to INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics; manuscript no. (Please, provide the manuscript number!)

many equivalent problems need to be solved in the branch-and-bound procedure to ensure
optimality.
Consider now a sequence of consecutive safe seating arrangements (Av )v∈V . Then, for
an arbitrary permutation σ ∈ Sym(|V |), the sequence (Aσ(v) )v∈V is again feasible. The
choice of permutations can even be done independently for each segment of the theatre,
i.e. the ground floor and its separate balconies. The following lemma provides a class of
inequalities that drastically reduces the feasible region by removing symmetries caused by
these permutation groups.
Proposition 1. Let a segment ` = 1, . . . , n in a theatre have a set of seats S ` ⊂ S. Let
≺ be the standard lexicographic ordering relation on S. For each (r0 , s0 ) ∈ S ` , v 0 ∈ V , a class
of symmetry breaking inequalities is
X
t0 ∈T

X

X

(r,s)∈S `
(r,s)≺(r0 ,s0 )

t0 ∈T

yr0 ,s0 ,t0 ,v0 ≤

yr,s,t0 ,v ,

∀v ∈ V : v < v 0 .

(14)

Suppose we are given a seat (r0 , s0 ) ∈ S ` , v 0 ∈ V and v < v 0 . The left hand side considers
families of size t starting on seat (r0 , s0 ) for show v 0 . The inequality tells us that we can only
place at family starting at (r0 , s0 ) for show v 0 whenever in an earlier show v < v 0 a family
was placed starting on some seat (r, s) ≺ (r0 , s0 ). Most importantly, we claim without proof
that it is a correct symmetry breaking method.
Lemma 4. There exists an optimal solution to (12) that satisfies inequalities (14).

5.

Computational results

We implemented the models (7) and (12) above in Julia 1.3.0, using the modelling language
JuMP to build the optimization model, with Gurobi as the lower level LP and MIP solver.
Experiments were run on a computer equipped with an Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.8
GHz with 32 GB of RAM. For our experiments we considered four different target profiles
p~ = (pt )t∈T , with T = {1, 2, 3, 4}, based on requests made by the MBE:
• Historical data on reservations: mge1 : p~ = (0.18, 0.7, 0.06, 0.06),
• Pairs only: mge2 : p~ = (0, 1, 0, 0),
• Singletons and pairs: mge3 : p~ = (0.2, 0.8, 0, 0),
• Pairs and quads: mge4 : p~ = (0, 0.5, 0, 0.5).

We solve the integer programming models in (7) and in (12) both for the Grand Room
and the Small Room, where we considered two scenarios for the set of consecutive shows:
V = {1} (single show) and V = {1, 2} (double show). Both the basic versions of both models (vanilla), and the versions with the speedup techniques (speedup) are considered and
compared. The speedup version is implemented by adding all inequalities described in
Section 4.3 to the ILP formulations. We set ε = 0.02 for the constraints in (6), as we empirically observe this choice for ε to give a suitable tradeoff between solver performance and
solution structure with respect to target profiles. The same forbidden areas are considered
for both theatre rooms, as the interseat distances coincide for both rooms. Additionally, we
adapt the Gurobi parameters Symmetry, Cuts and Presolve to their aggressive settings.
Table 1 and Table 2 provide the densities d(A(~
p)) for the Grand Room and the Small
Room respectively, where A(~
p) is an optimal safe seating arrangement with respect to an
indicated target profile p~, both for the single show and double show case.

Let us first comment on the densities found in Tables 1 (Grand Room) and 2 (Small
Room). For each of the four target profiles, the differences in density between the Grand
Room and the Small Room are small, both for the single show and for the double show
situation. This is to be expected as the interseat distances from Figure 1 apply to both

20

rooms. Also, in case of a single show, the densities found are rather similar for the four
different target profiles, with the exception of mge4. Target profile mge4 has a relatively
large fraction of families of size 4 (the largest family size considered), which is beneficial for
finding seating arrangements with a large density (see the discussion in Section 4.1). However, in case of a single show, all profiles allow a density of around 33% - this corresponds
to a setting with 1/3 of the seats being occupied in a single show.
When analyzing the outcomes for a double show, we observe that the presence of large
families (mge4) leads to better densities - this effect is more pronounced compared to
a single show. Another interesting observation is that the densities almost double when
compared to a single show. Hence, the effect of the constraint that a seat can be used
at most once in two shows is negligible; in other words, the model is able to find two
single show seating arrangements with no seats in common such that the numbers of seats
occupied in both shows is (almost) balanced. For the target profile based on historical data,
mge1, the model is able to find seating arrangements that use almost 2/3 of the available
seats. This is an important finding as it gives the MBE an idea of the consequences of
having consecutive shows.
Let us now comment on the computation times. In particular, we see that adding a
second show to the model drastically increases the computation time of the solver, which
can probably be explained by the fact that additional symmetries are introduced in the
problem by adding a second show and that the number of variables and constraints both
increase linearly in |S|. Furthermore, the choice for the target profile also largely influences
the running time of the algorithm. It is striking to see that the instances for which the
algorithm has the worst performance are also the ones for which the target profiles are
further away from intuitively optimal, i.e. relatively large proportions of small families and
relatively small proportions of large families. For the instances on the Grand Room, we see
that the impact of adding the speedup techniques is rather large. This can be explained
by the fact that these instances have a rich variety of symmetries.
Real life implementation: alternating empty rows

Recall that in Section 3.3, we analyzed a setting where in each show, seats in row r could
be occupied by guests whenever row r − 1 and r + 1 (if existent) were empty, for any row
r.

Tables 3 and 4 report the optimum densities of safe seating arrangements A0 (~
p) that have
the property of using only one of two consecutive rows at a time per show, for the Grand
Room and the Small Room respectively. For the double show case, this means in the first
show, all odd-numbered rows are used, and all even-numbered rows in the second. We only
report computation times for the vanilla descriptions, as these speedup techniques now
only yield redundant inequalities. The column called “Loss (%)” indicates the percentual
loss of occupied seats, which can be seen as a proxy for the loss in revenue.

Clearly, as the results in Tables 3 and 4 correspond to a more restricted setting of our
problem, the realized densities are always smaller than those achieved for the setting where
all rows can be used for all shows. Indeed, we observe that for all instances, especially the
ones based on the Small Room, the percentual loss of occupied seats is rather significant,
with no percentual loss smaller than 5.7% of occupied seats.
Computation times for this setting are much smaller. This is caused by the much smaller
size of the resulting instances and much fewer dependencies between the variables.
The solutions that correspond to the occupancies for the target profile mge1 given in
Tables 1 to 4 are provided in the appendices. We used the color red to indicate that those
seats are forbidden for use by guests and the color green (and blue for two consecutive
shows) to indicate seats that can be occupied by guests.

Upper bounds for the occupancy in MBE

In Table 5, we list the number of seats |S| and the number of virtual seats (the “rim”)
|(S + T ) \ S|, in each of the two rooms of the MBE. By applying Theorems 2 and 3 to the
rooms of the MBE, we can find upper bounds on the achievable occupancy.

From Theorem 2, we can deduce the following bound for a single safe seating arrangement
A for the Small Room:
X

(2t + 3)nt (A) = 5n1 (A) + 7n2 (A) + 9n3 (A) + 11n4 (A) ≤ 400 + 135 = 533.

Analogously, we have for the Grand Room
5n1 (A) + 7n2 (A) + 9n3 (A) + 11n4 (A) ≤ 1250 + 458 = 1708.
We consider these volume bounds on the realized safe seating arrangements Amax corresponding to the data in Table 1 and Table 2 on the single show setting, for the Grand
Room and the Small Room respectively. The following table provides the left hand sides on
these volume bounds to illustrate the strength of these bounds. Recall the right hand sides
for the Grand Room (1708) and Small Room (533). The interpretation of the numbers

by a trapezoid. The gap on the volume bound can be explained by the fact that the trapezoid forms do not allow for a perfect packing of seats, and this effect is amplified by the
inclusion of target profiles, which further restrict the set of possible trapezoid packings.
Secondly, we consider the bound given by Theorem 3. Now, we consider the upper bound
for occupation densities d(A(~
p)) of this bound corresponding to maximum safe seating
arrangements in the model of (12). For convenience, we include the results on the realized
occupation densities for the single show setting using all rows again in Table 7.

We observe that the realized optimal densities are not very far away from the respective
upper bounds in Table 7. Nevertheless, the bound of Theorem 3 is based on perfect tilings
of trapezoids of one family size in a suitable chosen theatre architecture, which is not the
case for typical inputs. This is a possible explanation for the gap between the bound and
the realized density

Conclusion

The 1.5 meter constraint has a huge impact on the occupancy when filling a theatre. In
case of the MBE, when performing a single show on an evening, occupancy will not exceed
40% (both for the Grand Room and the Small Room). However, allowing two shows per
evening, it is possible to reach an occupancy of 70% while satisfying the constraint that no
seat is sold twice. A more logistically suitable solution is to use alternating empty rows,
but this comes at the cost of losing at least 5% on the number of occupied seats. The
corresponding solutions, together with other innovations, may offer some hope to theatres
to remain competitive.
