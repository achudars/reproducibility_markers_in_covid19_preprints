ABSTRACT
The objective of this work is to explore popular discourse
about the COVID-19 pandemic and policies
implemented to manage it. Using Natural Language
Processing, Text Mining, and Network Analysis to
analyze corpus of tweets that relate to the COVID-19
pandemic, we identify common responses to the
pandemic and how these responses differ across time.
Moreover, insights as to how information and
misinformation were transmitted via Twitter, starting at
the early stages of this pandemic, are presented. Finally,
this work introduces a dataset of tweets collected from
all over the world, in multiple languages, dating back to
January 22nd, when the total cases of reported COVID19 were below 600 worldwide. The insights presented in
this work could help inform decision makers in the face
of future pandemics, and the dataset introduced can be
used to acquire valuable knowledge to help mitigate the
COVID-19 pandemic.

INTRODUCTION
The Coronavirus Disease of 2019, known as
COVID-19, is a rapidly spreading disease caused by the
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV2). The COVID-19 is now considered a
pandemic that has affected countries in all inhabited
continents. Since the first cases of COVID-19 reported
in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the number of
fatalities worldwide has increased rapidly. Due to its
high infection and death rate, governments have
implemented a wide range of policies aimed at
mitigating the spread of this virus and its impact. Such
actions began with the Chinese government order to
quarantine Wuhan on January 23rd, 2020, to, most
recently, multiple countries declaring state of emergency
and implementing strict quarantine and social distancing
measurements (e.g., US, Italy, Argentina, Spain).

Most government leaders have implemented
measures to incentivize, and in some cases enforce,
“social distancing” to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
These measures have resulted in the cancelled
entertainment events, closures of schools and colleges,
and businesses reducing hours of operation, implement
telecommuting, or close altogether. There is no doubt the
pandemic and the measures set in place to mitigate it
have and will continue to drastically impact the lives of
millions. As this pandemic and the responses to it are
unprecedented, however, we are likely to be surprised by
how people respond.
Since the early stages of the disease, people have
expressed their opinion and shared information, as well
as misinformation, about it via social media platforms,
such as Twitter. As COVID-19 spreads to other countries
and governments try to mitigate its impact by
implementing counter measures, people have also used
social media platforms to express their opinion about the
measures themselves, the leaders implementing them,
and the ways their lives are changing. The use of social
media, such as Twitter, as platforms to express opinions
and share information about COVID-19, will only
continue to grow, precisely because of the “social
distancing” measures set in place to mitigate it.
Policymakers could mine this social media data to
explore popular discourse about the pandemic and the
measures set in place to mitigate it. We plan to analyze a
corpus of tweets that relate to COVID-19 with the
objective of identifying common responses to the
pandemic and how these responses differ across time,
countries, and policies. Moreover, insights as to how
information and misinformation about this pandemic and
the polices are transmitted are presented. Finally, we
introduce and share with the research community a
dataset of tweets collected from all over the world, in
multiple languages, dating back to January 22nd when
the total cases of reported COVID-19 were below 600
worldwide. Here, we describe and present descriptive

statistics of this dataset, and explain our data collection
methods and intended analyses.
DATASET DESCRIPTION
The dataset presented is being continuously
collected using the Twitter API. The dataset presented
here (v1) covers 22 January to 13 March 2020 and
contains 6,468,526 tweets. The keywords used for search
tweets are: virus and coronavirus since 22 January,
ncov19 and ncov2019 since 26 February, and covid since
7 March 2020.
The average daily number of tweets collected on
dataset
v1
was
208,662.1
(SD=100,448.7,
Mdn=243,087). The number of tweets collected
increased every month from 724,877 in January,
3,084,729 in February, to 2,658,920 in just the first 13
days of March. Table 1 show the summary statistics for
the daily number of tweets collected each month and on
the first 13 days of March.

While the dataset contains tweets from 66
languages, only English-language tweets were collected
from 22 January to 30 January 2020. English-language
tweets remain the most prominent in the dataset
accounting for 63.4% of the total. Figure 1 presents the
distribution of collected tweets by language.

Information about retweets and likes was also
collected. Figure 2 below presents the distribution of
collected tweets’ retweets over the observed period.
While the overall level of retweeting appears to have
declined in February, retweets rose abruptly as the crisis
ramped up in Europe in late February and early March.

In addition to language, a relatively small
percentage of the collected tweets contain geolocations.

DATASET ACCESSIBILITY
The dataset v1 was realized on 23 March 2020. The
dataset
is
available
on
Github
at
:
https://github.com/lopezbec/COVID19_Tweets_Dataset
The dataset is released in compliance with the Twitter’s
Terms & Conditions. Hence, only the tweets-IDs are
made available to researchers. However, using the
Tweeter API the tweets can be “rehydrate” and the data
of tweets that have not been deleted can be accessed
(more details on the GitHub page). This dataset is still
being continuously collected and routinely updated. If
you have technical questions about the data collection,
please contact the corresponding author.

FUTURE WORK
This research note’s main objective was to introduce
and share with the research community a dataset of
tweets related to the COVID-19. We are continuously
collecting and routinely updating the dataset. Similarity,
we will be using Natural Language Processing and Text
Mining, and Network Analysis to analyze the corpus of
tweets to identify common popular responses to the
pandemic and how these responses differ across time.
Moreover, with this dataset we will explore to how
information and misinformation about COVID-19 is
transmitted via Twitter.
