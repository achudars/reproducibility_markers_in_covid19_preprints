A BSTRACT

Motivated by the importance of individual differences in risk perception and behavior change in
people’s responses to infectious disease outbreaks (particularly the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic),
we propose a heterogeneous Disease-Behavior-Information (hDBI) transmission model, in which
people’s risk of getting infected is influenced by information diffusion, behavior change, and disease
transmission. We use both a mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the
dynamics of the model. Information diffusion influences behavior change by allowing people to
be aware of the disease and adopt self-protection, and subsequently affects disease transmission by
changing the actual infection rate. Results show that (a) awareness plays a central role in epidemic
prevention; (b) a reasonable fraction of “over-reacting" nodes are needed in epidemic prevention; (c)
R0 has different effects on epidemic outbreak for cases with and without asymptomatic infection;
(d) social influence on behavior change can remarkably decrease the epidemic outbreak size. This
research indicates that the media and opinion leaders should not understate the transmissibility and
severity of diseases to ensure that people could become aware of the disease and adopt self-protection
to protect themselves and the whole population.

1 Introduction
People’s responses to infectious diseases could greatly affect the transmission patterns of diseases, and information
about the transmissibility and severity of the disease conveyed through the media and opinion leaders plays a central
role in raising awareness and influencing people’s decision-making on whether or not to adopt self-protection (i.e.,
taking recommended practices to reduce the risk of infection, such as wearing a mask and washing hands with hanitizer
in the COVID-19 context [1]) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Here, opinion leaders refer to individuals whose opinions are widely
accepted by other people [8, 9].
Many studies [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] used mathematical models to investigate how disease awareness affects
the outbreaks of diseases. Most approaches [17, 18] explored this problem by modifying the parameters in standard
epidemic models. Funk et al. [19] first incorporated the effect of awareness into classic epidemic models and found
that the spread of awareness could substantially reduce the epidemic outbreak size. Gross et al. [20] studied epidemic
dynamics on an adaptive network, in which susceptible nodes avoid contact with infected nodes by rewiring their
connections. Wu et al. [21] modeled the effect of three forms of awareness: global awareness, local awareness, and
contact awareness. They showed that only global awareness cannot decrease the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak.
Chen [22] examined how the amount of information affects behavior change, and showed that increasing the amount
of information that people possess may lower the likelihood of disease eradication.
Multiplex (also named multilayer) networks [23, 24] have been developed to model the dynamic interactions between
the spread of information and infection. The spreading of information and infection is represented by multiple network
layers. For example, Granell et al. [25] proposed the susceptible-infected-susceptible unaware-aware-unaware (SISUAU) model that can capture the critical point of the disease outbreak determined by the topological structure of the
virtual information diffusion network. It can be extended to many model variants, such as the multiple-information
model [26] that incorporates more than one type of information; the local awareness controlled contagion spreading
model [27], in which the awareness transition is further influenced by the extent of the awareness of all neighbors;
and the susceptible-infected-recovered unaware-aware (SIR-UA) model [28] that also considers the recovered state. In
addition to information diffusion and disease transmission, the transmission of protective behavior has been simulated
[29].
Recent studies examined the effect of the media on infectious disease epidemics [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37].
Liu et al. [32] proposed a mechanism to illustrate the effect of the media by incorporating the reported numbers of
infectious and hospitalized individuals into classic epidemic models. Wang and Xiao [33] used a threshold model
where the media can exhibit its effect only when the number of reports reaches a certain value. Dubey et al. [34, 35]
discussed the optimal amount of information that can not only suppress the transmission of disease but also prevent
“media-fatigue." Song and Xiao [36, 37] further considered the delay of media effects on people’s responses.
To summarize, existing studies indicate that the interplay between awareness and social network structure could greatly
influence the transmission of infectious diseases. However, few studies have considered individual differences in
people’s responses to messages conveyed through the media and opinion leaders during epidemics. People’s responses
are not only influenced by the transmissibility and severity of the disease, but also the personal risk perception [38, 39,
40]. Here, risk perception refers to the subjective judgment about the risk of the disease. Similar to smart nodes in
information diffusion [41, 42], individuals who are more fearful of being infected actively engage in self-protection
and information sharing. We label these people as “over-reacting" as compared with “under-reacting" people who have
a relatively low risk perception. This classification can also be applied to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic,
in which a clear disparity in risk perception causes the diverse reactions of individuals regarding control measures
[43, 44, 45, 46]. Lessons from the COVID-19 outbreak in many countries imply that people responding properly to
the disease is more important than simple awareness.
Motivated by the importance of individual differences in risk perception and behavior change in people’s responses
to infectious disease outbreaks (particularly the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), we propose a heterogeneous DiseaseBehavior-Information (hDBI) transmission model, which consists of information diffusion, behavior change, and disease transmission. This model aims to describe how different types of nodes (“over-reacting" versus “under-reacting")
influence the prevalence of protective behavior and the epidemic outbreak. The contribution of this study is threefold: First, this is the first quantitative study that examines the incorporation of risk perception and disease-behaviorinformation transmission on a multilayer network. Second, we consider individual differences in the responses to
disease-related information originating from variations in the distribution of risk perception among people. Third, we
study analytically and numerically the effect of such differences on the epidemic.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we describe the model details in section 2. Second, we adopt the
mean-field method [47] to formulate the problem mathematically in section 3. Third, we perform extensive experi2

ments with Poisson degree distribution-based Erdős–Rényi networks and explore the effects of different parameters
on the epidemic outbreak in section 4. Lastly, we conclude the paper with discussions of future work in section 5.

2 Model
We propose a three-layer network model, namely, the heterogeneous Disease-Behavior-Information (hDBI) transmission model, to incorporate information diffusion, behavior change, and disease transmission. Here, nodes may become
aware of the risk of getting infected and then change their behavior by adopting self-protection, which will further affect the disease transmission. We first introduce the details as shown in Fig. 1. All layers in the model contain the
same set of nodes.
On the bottom layer, namely, the Information Diffusion Layer, edges represent the social contacts through which nodes
can share the disease-related information. The sources of the information are the media and opinion leaders. Nodes
are divided into three classes on this layer: Ignorants, Spreaders, and Stif lers denoted by IG, SP , and SF ,
respectively. Ignorants are those who are unaware of the disease-related information and can become Spreaders
(with a probability α) or Stif lers (with a probability 1 − α) if at least one neighbor is a Spreader. Spreaders and
Stif lers are those who are aware of the disease. We assume that the states of Spreaders and Stif lers do not change
for simplification. Once a Spreader, the node will keep spreading the information to all its neighbors in each period.
Stif lers, on the other hand, do not further spread the information. We present the scheme mentioned above in panel
(c) of Fig. 2.
Each piece of information has an alarming level y, which represents the transmissibility and severity of the disease
conveyed through the media and opinion leaders. Each node on the network has a personal risk perception, a constant
3

parameter xi for node i. By comparing the values of y and xi , we classify nodes into two sets: {i | y ≥ xi },
“over-reacting", and {i | y < xi }, “under-reacting". “Over-reacting" nodes have a higher probability to spread the
information as follows

αo y ≥ xi
α=
(1)
αu y < xi
where 0 ≤ αu < αo ≤ 1.
On the middle layer, namely, the Behavior Change Layer, edges represent the social contacts through which a node
can observe other nodes’ states of behavior change. Nodes on this layer have two states: adopted self-protection
(A) and not adopted self-protection (N ). Ignorants on the Information Diffusion Layer are always in the N state
on the Behavior Change Layer because they are unaware of the risk. Spreaders and Stif lers have a tendency p
to change the behavior by adopting self-protection, and “over-reacting" nodes have higher behavior change tendency
than “under-reacting" nodes as follows

po y ≥ xi
p=
(2)
pu y < xi
where 0 ≤ pu < po ≤ 1.
The probability of a node to change behavior is not only dependent on p, but also the behavior of its neighbors. The
behavior change result can be determined in two steps. First, we use the tendency p to determine if the node changes
the behavior independent from the social influence. If the node does not change the behavior, then the model further
checks its neighbors’ states. If more than half of the nodes in its ego network (the node and all its neighbors) have
changed behavior, then the node will be influenced to change as well. Let k denote the degree of a node and z denote
the number of its neighbors who have already changed behavior, we use ϕ to summarize all neighbors’ states as follows
ϕ=

1 z >k−z+1
0 z ≤ k − z + 1,



(3)

the smallest integer value of z satisfying ϕ = 1 is ⌈ k+2
2 ⌉, thus the overall behavior change probability is as follows
P = p + (1 − p)W,

(4)

where W = P (ϕ = 1) = P (z ≥ ⌈ k+2
2 ⌉). We present the scheme mentioned above in panel (b) of Fig. 2.
The top layer, Disease Transmission Layer, is modeled by the generalized Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered
(SEIR) model. Edges represent the physical contacts through which diseases may transmit. The susceptible, exposed,
infectious, and recovered nodes are denoted by S, E, I, and R, respectively. A susceptible node can be infected
by either an infectious node with an infection rate βI or an exposed node with an infection rate βE . In the classic
SEIR model, exposed nodes are infected but do not develop symptoms nor become infectious. Here, we allow the
transmission from exposed nodes to model the widely reported asymptomatically-infected cases in the COVID-19
pandemic and other similar disease outbreaks [48, 49, 50]. If we set βE = 0, then this layer is identical to the classic
SEIR model. For simplicity and consistency with previous work [51, 52], the hDBI model ignores the transition
from asymptomatically-infected to recovered. However, the model is flexible in incorporating various asymptomatic
scenarios.
The infection rate β (including βI and βE ) is a constant value only related to the disease. The actual infection rate could
vary because of different self-protection outcomes. Considering an edge connecting two nodes, we use n ∈ {0, 1, 2}
to denote the number of nodes who have adopted self-protection. The actual transition rate is η n β, where η is the
ineffectiveness of self-protection behavior. η ∈ [0, 1]. η is 0 if the self-protection behavior is fully protective, and 1
if the self-protection behavior is entirely useless. An exposed node has a transition rate σ to become infectious, so
the incubation period is 1/σ. An infectious node has a transition rate γ to become recovered and immune to the same
disease. All possible state transitions are shown in panel (a) of Fig. 2.

3 Theoretical analysis
We adopt the mean-field approximation approach to analyze the dynamics of the hDBI model. This technique assumes
independence among the random variables and helps us study the complex stochastic model with a simpler model
[53, 54, 55]. For simplicity, we consider a three-layer network with the same topological structure. We consider an
Erdős–Rényi network of N nodes with a Poisson degree distribution P (k), where k denotes the degree of a node.
On the Information Diffusion Layer, ρIG (t), ρSP (t), and ρSF (t) denote the fraction of Ignorants, Spreaders, and
Stif lers, at time t, respectively. Thus, ρIG (t) + ρSP (t) + ρSF (t) = 1. An Ignorant remains unaware only if none

nodes, and αu and pu for “under-reacting" nodes, respectively.

of its neighbors are Spreaders. Hence, the probability that an IG node with degree k not being informed by any
neighbor is (1 − ρSP (t))k . Thus, the transition rate for a randomly selected IG node being informed by neighbors is
h(t) = 1 −

P (k)(1 − ρSP (t))k ,

where kmax denotes the maximum degree of the network.
Assuming a standard normal distribution of the risk perception xi , we can calculate the fraction of “over-reacting"
nodes by evaluating the corresponding cumulative distribution function at the alarming level y, denoted by a. Thus,
those who are aware of the disease will become Spreaders with a probability aαo + (1 − a)αu or become Stif lers
with a probability a(1 − αo ) + (1 − a)(1 − αu ).
On the Behavior Change Layer, let ρA (t) denote the fraction of nodes having adopted self-protection at time t, then
the probability for a node with degree k choosing to protect itself because of the social influence from neighbors is

which is equal to the probability that at least ⌈ k+2
2 ⌉ neighbors have adopted self-protection, thus the

changing behavior due to the social influence from neighbors for a randomly selected node is W = k=0 P (k)Wk .
Therefore, the probability of changing behavior is po + (1 − po )W for “over-reacting" nodes, and pu + (1 − pu )W for
“under-reacting" nodes [according to Eq. (4)]. Besides, Ignorants will never adopt self-protection, thus, the fraction
of nodes who might adopt behavior change at time t + 1 is ρSP (t + 1) + ρSF (t + 1). So we can get the fraction of
nodes having adopted self-protection at time t + 1 as follows:
ρA (t + 1) =[ρSP (t + 1) + ρSF (t + 1)] {apo + (1 − a)pu
+[a(1 − po ) + (1 − a)(1 − pu )]W },
Therefore,
ρN (t + 1) = 1 − ρA (t + 1),
which is the fraction of nodes having not adopted self-protection at time t + 1.

(6)
(7)

On the Disease Transmission Layer, the fraction of nodes in one of the four health states at time t is denoted by
ρS (t), ρE (t), ρI (t), and ρR (t). ρS (t) + ρE (t) + ρI (t) + ρR (t) = 1. For a single edge between a susceptible
node and an infected one, the probability that both have adopted self-protection is [ρA (t)]2 , and the corresponding
actual transition rate is η 2 β. The probability that both nodes have not adopted self-protection is [1 − ρA (t)]2 and
the corresponding actual transition rate is η 0 β. The probability that only one of them has adopted self-protection is
1 − [ρA (t)]2 − [1 − ρA (t)]2 and the corresponding actual transition rate is η 1 β. Thus, the actual infection rate l(β) is

l(β) =[ρA (t)]2 η 2 β + [1 − ρA (t)]2 η 0 β + 1 − [ρA (t)]2
(8)
−[1 − ρA (t)]2 η 1 β = β[1 + (η − 1)ρA (t)]2 .
For a node of state I, the infection propagates to its S neighbors with probability lI = l(βI ). For an exposed node who
is asymptomatically-infected, the corresponding probability lE = l(βE ). For a node of degree k with bE neighbors in
states E and bI neighbors in state I, the probability of being infected is qbE ,bI = 1 − (1 − lE )bE (1 − lI )bI , where
(1 − lE )bE (1 − lI )bI is the probability that the node is not infected by any infected neighbors. Thus, the transition

Then, we can obtain the following equations to describe the dynamics on the Disease Transmission Layer and the
Information Diffusion Layer in Fig. 1
ρS (t + 1) − ρS (t) = −c(t)ρS (t),
ρE (t + 1) − ρE (t) = −σρE (t) + c(t)ρS (t),
ρI (t + 1) − ρI (t) = −γρI (t) + σρE (t),
ρR (t + 1) − ρR (t) = γρI (t),
ρIG (t + 1) − ρIG (t) = −h(t)ρIG (t),
ρSP (t + 1) − ρSP (t) = h(t)ρIG (t)[aαo + (1 − a)αu ],
ρSF (t + 1) − ρSF (t) = h(t)ρIG (t)[a(1 − αo ) + (1 − a)(1 − αu )].

(11)

The dynamics on the Behavior Change Layer are described by Eq. (6) and Eq. (7). Information diffusion influences
the behavior change by determining the fraction of individuals who are being aware of the disease and adopting selfprotection accordingly [From Eq. (6)]. Disease transmission is subsequently affected by changing the actual infection
rate based on the outcome of behavior change [From Eq. (8)].

4 Results
We perform extensive Monte Carlo simulations to validate the mean-field approximation results obtained by Eq. (11).
For simplicity, we assume that αo = po = 0.99 and αu = pu = 0.01, indicating an extremely high probability to
inform others and to change behavior for “over-reacting" nodes and a much lower probability for “under-reacting"
nodes.
We present the comparison between the Monte Carlo simulation and the mean-field approximation results in Fig. 3 for
a three-layer network of 2,000 nodes with a mean degree of 15. We adopt the synchronous updating method [56] in
the Monte Carlo simulations to mimic the discrete-time transmission processes in our model. All nodes are selected
to update their states simultaneously in each time step. The time step is set as 1. At the beginning of each simulation,
we randomly select a node to be the initially infected node and another to be the first Spreader. The updating process
stops when there is no infected node in the network. Each point in Fig. 3 is obtained by averaging 50 Monte Carlo
simulations. As illustrated in Fig. 3, we observe a high R2 of 0.990 for the top panel (the fraction of susceptible
nodes at the stationary state ρS (∞)), and 0.994 for the bottom panel (the fraction of Spreaders at the stationary state
ρSP (∞)). This finding validates that the equations in Eq. (11) can effectively capture the dynamics of the model.
Here, the stationary state refers to the state at t → ∞. Moreover, the fraction of “over-reacting" nodes a has a linear
effect on ρSP (∞) but a sigmoid effect on ρS (∞).
We examine the degree to which the “over-reacting" nodes influence the disease dynamics under different situations.
Analytical solutions for Eq. (11) are difficult to obtain. Thus, full phase diagrams are used to illustrate the results. We
adopt the same three-layer network mentioned in the aforementioned Monte Carlo simulations.
First, we focus on the diseases without asymptomatically-infected cases (i.e., βE = 0). When βE = 0, the Diseases
Transmission Layer is essentially an SEIR model and has similar patterns with the standard models given fixed values
of a [57, 58]. The fraction of susceptible nodes at the stationary state ρS (∞) is shown in Fig. 4 concerning the
infection rate βI and the fraction of “over-reacting" nodes a. Similar to Fig. 3, a has a sigmoid effect on ρS (∞) as
shown in Fig. 4. We find that ρS (∞) generally has three phases: When a is small, ρS (∞) is close to 0, and when a is
large, ρS (∞) is close to 1. A threshold triggers the rapid increase in ρS (∞). The exact value of the threshold cannot
be analytically obtained. This indicates that by increasing the fraction of “over-reacting" nodes through highlighting
the transmissibility and severity of the disease, we can largely prevent the disease outbreak. As long as the fraction of
“over-reacting" nodes reaches the threshold, further highlight this fraction is not necessary. This finding shows that the
disease outbreak is preventable when the media and opinion leaders are playing effective roles of the whistle-blower.
More specifically, when βI is extremely small, all possible values of a yield to the fully prevented scenario (blue). As
βI increases, the range of a rapidly increases and yields the full outbreak scenario (red). When βI keeps increasing,
the range of a yielding to full outbreak scenario gradually increases. We define the critical value of βI as the value
leading to the basic reproduction number R0 = βI /γ = 1, below which the epidemic is under control. As shown in
panel (a) of Fig. 7, where a is fixed, the higher the recovery rate γ, the larger the critical value of βI . Given the same
βI , we can observe an increase in ρS (∞) with a longer incubation period 1/σ or a smaller R0 (larger γ), see panel (a)
of Fig. 7. It might be because a longer incubation period can provide more time for the awareness to be transmitted
among people, and a smaller R0 means a less transmissible disease. Thus, a smaller fraction of “over-reacting" nodes
is needed to prevent the full outbreak.

between the fraction of susceptible nodes at the stationary state ρS (∞) and the fraction of “over-reacting" nodes a
(top panel), and the relationship between the fraction of Spreaders at the stationary state ρSP (∞) and a (bottom
panel). βI = 0.5, βE = 0, σ = 0.8, γ = 0.5, η = 0.1, αo = po = 0.99, αu = pu = 0.01.
Second, we consider the diseases with asymptomatically-infected cases. Given that not all exposed individuals are asymptomatically-infected, and the asymptomatically-infected cases are often not more infectious than
symptomatically-infected cases [48, 49, 50, 59], we denote the asymptomatic infection rate as βE = µβI , where
µ ∈ (0, 1). We report the fraction of susceptible nodes at the stationary state ρS (∞) in Fig. 5 where µ ∈ {0.2, 0.4, 0.8}.
The values of other parameters are the same as those in panel (b) of Fig. 4, where the asymptomatic infection is not
considered. We find that when asymptomatic infections exist, the range of a yielding to the full outbreak scenario
is larger, and the effect becomes more significant with a larger value of µ. In the extreme case when µ → 1, the
Disease Transmission Layer essentially becomes an SIR model with longer infectious period than the original SEIR
model. These results indicate that asymptomatic infections make it harder, sometimes even impossible, to control the
epidemic by only increasing the value of a (panel (c) of Fig. 5).
Furthermore, we explore the effects of “over-reacting" nodes with various parameter settings on the Disease Transmission Layer (representing different diseases) in Fig. 6. Compared with the cases where βE = 0, the existence of
asymptomatic infections reduces the critical values of βI and the values of ρS (∞), indicating that epidemic control is
more difficult (see Fig. 7). With the existence of asymptomatically-infected cases, R0 = βI /γ + βE /σ [60]. We find
that not only the higher recovery rate γ but also the shorter incubation period 1/σ can increase the critical value of βI .
A smaller R0 does not always lead to a larger ρS (∞) in such cases. As illustrated in panel (b) of Fig. 7, given the same
βI , when γ increases to 0.8 from 0.2, R0 drops to 1.5 from 3. Thus, ρS (∞) increases for a less transmissible disease.
However, when σ increases to 0.8 (shorter incubation period), R0 decreases to 2.25 from 3 (less transmissible). Counterintuitively, ρS (∞) decreases to 0.05 from 0.096. That is because a larger σ not only leads to a smaller R0 but also
indicates a shorter incubation time for the awareness to spread out; therefore, fewer people are aware and protected.

Third, we further clarify the effect of “over-reacting" nodes on epidemic control for different values of α and p in Fig. 8.
For simplicity, we assume αu = 21 αo and pu = 21 po . Fewer nodes will be infected when α and p increase. When
the value of a increases, the epidemic is easier to control (a larger blue region in the figure). A small transitioning
space occurs between controlled (blue) and outbreak (red) scenarios, indicating that the epidemic can either be well
contained or will likely to infect the majority of people in the population.
Finally, we examine the fraction of susceptible nodes at the stationary state ρS (∞) in two scenarios: with and without
social influence on behavior change. Here, the scenario without social influence is modeled by setting W = 0
regardless of the behavior of the node’s neighbors. We consider two diseases with different parameter settings in Fig.
9. With the social influence on behavior change, we can achieve the fully controlled result (ρS (∞) → 1) with a lower
value of a for both diseases, indicating that we can effectively utilize the social influence among people to enhance the
disease prevention.
To further clarify such a significant effect on ρS (∞), we focus on one specific disease setting mentioned in Fig. 9 and

influence from neighbors (W ) over time in Fig. 10. Here, we consider two scenarios, where a = 0.2 and a = 0.4,
respectively. We observe that W increases rapidly over time and reaches an equilibrium state for both cases. Larger
a leads to a higher value of W at the equilibrium state. Assuming that the Information Diffusion Layer reaches the
equilibrium state at time tI , W reaches the equilibrium state at time tW , set T = max{tI , tW }, we obtain
ρA (T ) =[ρSP (T ) + ρSF (T )] {apo + (1 − a)pu +
[a(1 − po ) + (1 − a)(1 − pu )]W }
=[ρSP (T ) + ρSF (T )][apo + (1 − a)pu ] + [ρSP (T )
+ ρSF (T )][a(1 − po ) + (1 − a)(1 − pu )]W

(12)

from Eq. (6), indicating that the fraction of people who have adopted self-protection, ρA (T ), can be increased with
the help of social influence. In addition,
ρIG (T ) = ρIG (T )[1 − h(T )],

(13)

which indicates that ρIG (T ) = 0 or h(T ) = 0. h(T ) = 0 only if ρSP (T ) = 0 according to Eq. (5). We can derive
that if k[aαo + (1 − a)αu ] > 1, where k is the mean degree of the network, then information can always spread out
(ρSP (T ) > 0) [41]. In such cases, h(T ) 6= 0, thus, ρIG (T ) = 0, indicating that ρSP (T ) + ρSF (T ) = 1. Therefore,
Eq. (12) can be simplified as follows
ρA (T ) = apo + (1 − a)pu + [a(1 − po ) + (1 − a)(1 − pu )]W,

(14)

if k[aαo + (1 − a)αu ] > 1.
When a = 0.2, the value of W at t = T is small, indicating that social influence has little effect on the behavior
change. In such cases, k[aαo + (1 − a)αu ] = 3.09 > 1, then ρA (T ) ≈ apo +(1 − a)pu = 0.206, which is

small, indicating that the epidemic cannot be well contained. However, when a = 0.4, W reaches 1 rapidly, and
k[aαo + (1 − a)αu ] = 6.03 > 1, then ρA (T ) = 1. Thus, the actual infection rate l(β) = βη 2 is close to 0 for small η
according to Eq. (8). As a result, the transition probability for a susceptible node being infected is c(T ) → 0 according
to Eq. (9), indicating that the epidemic is approaching the end. Since ρS (t) is decreasing over time, the earlier c(t)
becomes 0, the fewer people are infected. Therefore, the fraction of susceptible nodes tends to remain high since
t = T with the existence of social influence, which happens earlier than that without social influence (panel (d) in
Fig. 10). These results indicate that social influence on behavior change can significantly accelerate behavior change
and lead to a smaller epidemic outbreak.

5 Conclusion
In this study, we develop a heterogeneous Disease-Behavior-Information (hDBI) transmission model to characterize
the heterogeneous processes of information diffusion, behavior change, and disease transmission on social networks.
We adopt the mean-field approximation approach to obtain analytical results and perform extensive Monte Carlo
simulations to examine the patterns of disease transmission in the presence of information diffusion and behavior
change among people. We find that (a) disease awareness plays a central role in preventing the disease outbreak; (b)
a reasonable fraction of “over-reacting" nodes are needed to effectively control the epidemic; (c) a smaller R0 always
leads to a smaller epidemic outbreak without symptomatically-infected cases. This scenario would have different
effects with asymptomatically-infected cases because a smaller R0 might result from a shorter incubation time. As a
result, people have a shorter period to become aware and adopt self-protection; (d) social influence on behavior change
can significantly decrease the outbreak size.
In practice, with the absence of vaccines and stringent control measures, the epidemic can still be well contained when
people are aware of the disease and adopt proper self-protection. The media and opinion leaders play a key role in
people’s disease awareness. If transmissibility and severity are understated by them, then more people will remain
“under-reacting" and thus will be infected eventually. However, if they state unreasonably high transmissibility and
severity of the disease, the “crying wolf" effect could result in people losing confidence in the public health system.

Further research is needed to identify the optimal degree of transmissibility and severity stated by the media and
opinion leaders. This research has limitations. In the current model, we assume an unchanged topological structure of
the multiplex network, but uninfected nodes might break connections with infected nodes and form new connections
with other uninfected nodes to avoid being infected during epidemics. Incorporating the adaptive network schemes
into the current model by introducing a rewiring probability for uninfected nodes will be our future work. In the
COVID-19 context, many countries have seen protests against the lockdown measure, indicating that Stif lers could
even become another type of competing Spreaders that influence Ignorants to become Stif lers. Modeling the
competing behaviors during epidemics is an interesting topic for further exploration.
