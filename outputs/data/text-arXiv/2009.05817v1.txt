Abstract—Country image has a profound influence on international relations and economic development. In the worldwide outbreak of
COVID-19, countries and their people display different reactions, resulting in diverse perceived images among foreign public.
Therefore, in this study, we take China as a specific and typical case and investigate its image with aspect-based sentiment analysis on
a large-scale Twitter dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore country image in such a fine-grained way. To perform
the analysis, we first build a manually-labeled Twitter dataset with aspect-level sentiment annotations. Afterward, we conduct the
aspect-based sentiment analysis with BERT to explore the image of China. We discover an overall sentiment change from
non-negative to negative in the general public, and explain it with the increasing mentions of negative ideology-related aspects and
decreasing mentions of non-negative fact-based aspects. Further investigations into different groups of Twitter users, including U.S.
Congress members, English media, and social bots, reveal different patterns in their attitudes toward China. This study provides a
deeper understanding of the changing image of China in COVID-19 pandemic. Our research also demonstrates how aspect-based
sentiment analysis can be applied in social science researches to deliver valuable insights.
Index Terms—Country image, aspect-based sentiment analysis, social media.

OUNTRY image refers to the public perception of a
particular country, involving the attitudes of several aspects, such as politics, economy, diplomacy, and culture [1],
[2], [3]. Numerous studies have revealed that country image
plays an important role in international relations [4], [5] and
marketing [6], [7].
The image of a country often changes when global public
events happen, such as warfare, epidemic, and worldwide
sports events [8], [9], [10]. Recently, COVID-19 broke out
over the world and was declared as a pandemic by the
World Health Organization (WHO)1 . By June 21, 2020, more
than 8.8 million cases have been reported to WHO with
more than 465, 000 deaths2 . Maintaining livelihood in the
epidemic involves a balance between public safety, economy, and personal liberty and privacy, as well as all sectors
of the society. To lock down the city or keep the bars open?
To recommend facial masking or tell people the other way?
To enforce epidemic tracking apps or view the trace of
patients as privacy? These are all questions for governments
to answer. Different answers to these questions have led
to different situations of COVID-19 and greatly affected

foreign public perceptions at the same time. In addition, collective actions taken by the public also have their influence
on a country’s image. Therefore, we are dedicated to the
studying of the influence of COVID-19 pandemic on country
image, which is formulated as public sentiments toward
different aspects of a specific country in this work (Fig. 1).
Owing to its early outbreak and special role in COVID-19,
we regard China as a typical and special representative and
focus on the study of China’s country image in COVID-19
pandemic.
Most existing works study country image in news media
and view it as a news framing problem of a specific country [1], [11], [12]. With the great growth of social media3 ,
such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, country image can

be directly investigated from public expressions. Xiang [2]
first studies China’s image in social media by collecting
thousands of tweets posted by social media users as samples
and manually analyzing the topics of the tweets. Afterward,
Xiao et al. [13] adopt machine learning methods to analyze the aspects and overall sentiments toward China with
large-scale data from Twitter. However, these works ignore
the analysis of aspect-level sentiments, which is important
given the complexity of country image. The analysis of
aspect-level sentiments contributes to a deeper insight into
country image by discovering not only the aspects about
which the public are concerned but also their attitudes toward each of the aspects. As shown in Fig. 1, users in social
media usually express diverse sentiments toward different
aspects of a country, such as positive sentiment toward antiepidemic measures but negative sentiment toward politics.
Besides, previous studies lack the analysis of diverse user
accounts in social media, such as members of different
political parties, news media, and even non-human social
bots, who are likely to differ in aspect preferences and
sentiments about a specific country.
To address these issues, we focus on fine-grained mining
of country image in COVID-19 pandemic with aspect-based
sentiment analysis for large-scale data in social media. Due
to the absence of aspect-level sentiment dataset of country
image in social media, we manually build a fine-grained
Twitter dataset on China’s country image, in which each
tweet is labeled with the involving aspects and corresponding sentiments4 . As far as we know, this is the first aspectlevel sentiment dataset of country image. Based on the
dataset, we apply BERT [14] to aspect-based sentiment analysis of country image in a two-stage process with an aspect
detector and a sentiment classifier. Through the aspectbased sentiment analysis on large-scale tweet data from
diverse users, we obtain many insightful results, with the
following as the most prominent.
•

•

•

The total discussions on China about COVID-19 decrease over time, while the proportions of ideological
aspects, namely politics, foreign affairs, and racism,
remain high or even increase inversely.
The overall sentiment toward China grows negative
over time, with the sentiments of the factual aspects
in COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. epidemic situation and
anti-epidemic measures, are mainly non-negative,
while the sentiments of ideological aspects, such
as politics, foreign affairs, and racism are mainly
negative.
For the members of the U.S. Congress, both the
Democratic and the Republican members are concerned about politics and foreign affairs of China,
while for the Democrats the most mentioned aspect
is racism. As for sentiment, the Republican members
are more negative than the Democratic members.
However, the proportion of negative sentiment of the
Democrats has been increasing since April.
Between the media and the public, the mutual
aspect-level agenda-setting exists in most aspects
with the exceptions of politics and foreign affairs,

while the mutual sentiment-level agenda-setting is
only observed in the sentiment of anti-epidemic measures. The overall sentiment of media toward China
is mainly non-negative while the negative sentiment
is non-trivial.
Compared with the general users, the social bots
are more likely to discuss the politics and the antiepidemic measures, and express more negative sentiments in epidemic situation, anti-epidemic measures,
and racism toward China.

DATASET

In this section, we will first introduce the COVID-19-related
Twitter dataset and its collection process. Afterward, we will
present the manually labeled aspect-level sentiment dataset
of China’s image in detail.
2.1

COVID-19-related Twitter Dataset

The COVID-19-related Twitter dataset we utilize is based
on the dataset built by Chen et al. [15], which is collected by
tracking certain COVID-19-related keywords and accounts.
We use the tweets posted from January 22 to May 21, 2020,
with 40 percent sampled each day for our analysis. We keep
the tweets whose language attributes are marked as English
by Twitter API and filter them with a set of China-related
keywords, resulting in 6, 598, 146 tweets discussing China
in the pandemic. Note that the collection of the original
dataset went down several times, each for some hours, and
stopped for a whole day on February 23.
2.2

Aspect-level Sentiment Dataset of China’s Image

In order to conduct a fine-grained analysis of China’s image
in COVID-19 pandemics, we manually build an aspect-level
sentiment dataset of China’s image based on the COVID-19related Twitter dataset in Section 2.1.
Specifically, we first sample 10, 000 tweets posted from
January 22 to April 23 with the same sample rates kept each
day. Afterward, we annotate each tweet with the involved
aspects and the corresponding sentiments. Based on the
overview of COVID-19-related Twitter dataset, we define
seven different aspect categories, namely politics, economy,
foreign affairs, culture, epidemic situation, anti-epidemic
measures, and racism toward China. Note that each tweet
can be annotated with multiple labels of aspect. The detailed
descriptions of these seven aspects are as follows:
•

•

•

Politics. This includes judgments over China’s ideology, political system, human right status, capabilities
of the government, etc., as well as the relationship
between Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong and
Taiwan.
Economy. This refers to the impact of COVID-19
on Chinese economy. For instance, tweets expressing concern over foreign companies retracting from
China due to the pandemic are related to economy.
Foreign affairs. This includes all sorts of foreign
affairs whose practitioner is China, such as COVID19-related information opening, foreign aids, conspiracy theories, manipulation over the World Health
Organization, etc.

Culture. This includes culture-related contents that
are involved in the pandemic. Prominent examples
are the myths of Chinese wildlife consumption and
personal hygiene habits of Chinese people.
Epidemic situation. These tweets reflects the situation of the epidemic in China, including statistical
data, stories about individuals in the epidemic, etc.
Anti-epidemic measures. This includes the measures
taken by the Chinese government or Chinese people in order to contain the virus, be it compulsory
or voluntary. Travel restrictions, mask wearing, and
vaccine development all fall into this aspect.
Racism. This includes those names of COVID-19
virus and epidemic with a racist color, such as
“Wuhan virus.” In addition to that, racist feelings
toward China or Chinese and discussion about this
phenomenon are included as well.

For each of the aspects that appears in a tweet, the sentiment
is labeled into one of the three classes: negative, neutral, or
positive. Besides, the overall sentiment is also annotated for
each tweet into the same three classes if the tweet is relevant.
The labeling process consists of two phases. In the first
phase, each tweet is labeled by two annotators, who are
required to read a manual providing guidelines and go
through a test before labeling. If the two annotators disagree
on any aspect of the tweet, it will enter into the second

phase of labeling. In the second phase, tweets with disagreements are assigned to more senior annotators, who major in
journalism and communication and are well trained before
labeling as well. The final labels are determined if two
out of three annotators reach an agreement. Those tweets
without agreements are discarded. The final aspect-level
sentiment dataset of China’s image consists of 8, 019 tweets.
The detailed statistics of the tweets are shown in Table 1.

A SPECT- BASED S ENTIMENT A NALYSIS M ETHOD

In this section, we will introduce our aspect-based sentiment
analysis method, which aims to detect the aspects and classify the corresponding sentiments. First, we will formalize
the aspect-based sentiment analysis problem. Afterward, the
basic framework BERT in our method will be described.
Then the details of our two-stage process for aspect-based
sentiment analysis will be discussed. At last, we will present
the performance of our method.
3.1

Problem Formalization

Given the text of a tweet x, we aim to detect the series
of involved aspects a = a1 , a2 , . . . , an together with the
corresponding aspect-level sentiments y = y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ,
where n denotes the number of aspects discussed in the
tweet. Note that the aspect in our method is from a fixed set
A defined in section 2.2, with the sentiment derived from
the set Y .
3.2

Basic Framework with BERT

BERT, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a language model for pre-training which utilizes
a bidirectional encoder to learn the text representation. It has
been widely used for a variety of downstream tasks, such
as text classification, question answering, natural language
inference [14], [16], [17], [18]. Therefore, we use BERT as our
basic framework to obtain the representations of tweets.
Specifically, in our work, we insert a special [CLS] token
to the beginning of the tweet text x first, then feed the
text with the token into BERT. The output of the [CLS]
token can be viewed as a representation of the whole text.
Therefore, the final hidden state h of [CLS] is extracted as
the representation of the tweet:

h = BERT([CLS, x]).
Note that we learn two representations of each tweet. ha
is used for the aspect detection and hy is for sentiment
classification.
3.3

Two-stage Process

The whole process of our method breaks down into two
stages, the aspect detection stage and sentiment classification stage.
In the aspect detection stage, the model focuses on
detecting the aspect discussed in the tweet, which can be
regarded as a multi-label classification task. Specifically, we
view the tweet representation ha learned from BERT as
features and use a non-linear layer to project it into the target
space of aspect:

pa = σ(Wa ∗ ha + ba ),

where σ(·) is sigmoid non-linearity and pa denotes the
probabilities. Note that the dimension of pa is equal to the
size of aspect set |A|. The loss function is further defined in
a binary cross entropy form:
X
La = −
[tai log(pai ) + (1 − tai )log(1 − pai )],
ai ∈A

where tai and pai stand for the binary target and the
prediction of a single aspect ai , respectively. By minimizing
the loss, the model learns to detect the aspects in a tweet.
In the sentiment classification stage, the model aims to
classify the sentiment referring to the specific aspects. We
take a similar approach to the first stage to get the sentiment
distribution py :

py = σ(Wy ∗ hy + by ).
The only difference lies in the loss function:
X
Ly = −
[tyi log(pyi ) + (1 − tyi )log(1 − pyi )].
yi ∈y

The sentiments not in the list y of the specific tweet but in
the set Y are masked in the loss.
During inference, this model first detects the involved
aspects and then classifies the sentiments according to the
detected aspects.
3.4

Performance

To verify the performance of our two-stage BERT-based
model, we conduct experiments on the aspect-level sentiment dataset of China’s image.
Due to data scarcity shown in Table 1, we discard the
“economy” aspect and the “culture” aspect, which are unimportant in China’s image in COVID-19 pandemic. Neutral
class and positive class of sentiment are merged on account
of the high imbalance in dataset, resulting in a two-way
sentiment classification, negative or non-negative. We then
split the processed dataset into a training set, a development
set, and a test set, the sizes of which follow an 8 : 1 : 1 ratio.
Besides, to augment our training data, we train an extra XGBoost [19] model to infer the aspects and the corresponding
sentiments of unseen tweets. We sample up to 300 tweets
with no less than 90% confidence in each aspect respectively

and ask the senior annotators to label these samples, which
are then added to our training dataset.
We compare our BERT-based model with a support
vector machine (SVM) [20] with unigrams as features in
both aspect detection and sentiment classification stage,
and with VADER [21], a lexicon and rule-based sentiment
analysis tool specifically tuned for social media texts, in
the sentiment classification stage. We also compare with a
state-of-the-art model (NLI-M) [16] that solves the problem
jointly without breaking it down into two stages by turning
it into a question answering or natural language inference
problem with an auxiliary sentence.
The performance of our model is shown in Table 2. From
the table we can observe that: (1) Our BERT-based aspect
detection model consistently outperforms SVM model in
every aspect both on Macro F1 and Micro F1 scores. (2)
Our BERT-based sentiment classification model performs
better in most aspects on Macro F1 and Micro F1, compared
with VADER. (3) Our model achieves better performance to
the joint NLI-M model in most aspects, with other aspects
similar. Note that the results in politics aspects are less
persuasive as the number of non-negative tweets involving
politics in the test set is very limited, although SVM and the
joint model outperform our model on Micro F1.

C HINA ’ S IMAGE IN COVID-19 PANDEMIC

In this section, we will explore the fine-grained China’s
image in COVID-19 pandemic with regard to diverse users
on Twitter, which adopt our aspect-level sentiment analysis method. First, we will analyze China’s image among
general public. Afterward, the concerns and attitudes of
U.S. congress members, both the Democratic Party and the
Republican Party, will be discussed toward China. At last,
we will investigate China’s image presented by English
media and social bots on Twitter, and compare them with
the general public.
4.1

Image among General Public

Before analyzing China’s image, we calculate the daily
number of tweets involving China in COVID-19 pandemic
in Fig. 2. As shown in the figure, we can observe an overall
decline of the China-related numbers after the initial burst

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015

in late-January, as the epidemic gets gradually contained in
China and starts to break out globally. Besides, one peak
can be discovered in early March when the World Health
Organization upgraded the risk of COVID-19 to “very high”
and the U.S. Federal Reserve cut the interest rates by 0.5%.

Fig. 2: Number of daily tweets related to China in COVID-19
pandemic. The number is averaged in 7-days to be smooth.
Aspect Distribution
Fig. 3 shows the daily proportion of tweets related to each
of the aspects. Two different types of patterns emerge from
the figure: (1) For those aspects that are closely related to
an ideological dimension, namely politics, foreign affairs,
and racism, their proportions either stay at a relatively high
level or climb up over time. Specifically, the proportions of
politics-related tweets undergo a decrease in late-February,
but turn up again in the middle of March. The proportions
of foreign-affairs-related tweets display relatively stable
increases throughout the span of our dataset, with midMarch as an accelerating point. For racism, the proportion
keeps rising from early-March to mid-March, followed by
decreasing in late-March while it is consistently higher than
that before mid-March. One of the reasons of the huge
change in March is that the U.S. President Donald Trump
used the term “Chinese Virus” in his tweet 5 and triggered
rising discussions of racism on Twitter. (2) In the aspects of
epidemic situation and anti-epidemic measures, which are
more factual dimensions of China, the proportions related
declined over the months. One interpretation is that China’s
efforts took effect and the epidemic in China were gradually
under control. Another possible explanation is the English
world was facing increasing hardship in their own countries. Both of the two reasons shift public attention away
from China to their domestic affairs.
Aspect-level Sentiment Distribution
Fig. 4 depicts the overall aspect-level sentiment distribution
from January to May among general public. As we can see,
in the aspects related to ideology, including politics, foreign
affairs, and racism, negative tweets are high in quantity
than non-negative ones. However, in the aspects related to
factual affairs, namely epidemic situation and anti-epidemic
measures, non-negative tweets outweigh the negative ones.
Fig. 5 displays the proportions of negative/non-negative
sentiments in each aspect over time. From the Fig. 5(f),

(e) Racism

Fig. 3: Daily proportion of tweets related to each aspect. The
lines are smoothed by taking a 7-day average.

Fig. 4: Overall aspect-level sentiment distribution from January to May among general public.
we can observe that the overall sentiment turns from a
non-negative-leading pattern into a negative-leading one.
From the other subgraphs of Fig. 5, we can find that the
negative sentiments keep to be the main ones along time on
politics, foreign affairs, and racism aspects, while the nonnegative sentiments take the lead on the epidemic situation
and anti-epidemic measures aspects. Combined with Fig. 3,
we can explain the overall sentiment change, where overall
non-negative sentiments dip as the proportions of epidemic
situation and anti-epidemic measures drop, and overall
negative attitudes rise as the proportion of politics, foreign
affairs, and racism aspects turn up.

the voices from the two major political parties of the United

communication process as an opinion flow that originates
from the government to the public with media and opinion
leaders in between [22]. It is without doubt that a closer look
at where the opinions originate from would be valuable
for our purpose. Therefore, in this section, we explore the
aspects and sentiments of the tweets from the U.S. Congress
members.
Tweet Collection for Congress Members
For the members of the U.S. Congress, we are only interested
in those who are affiliated with the two major parties. We
search names of the congress members on Twitter to locate
their accounts. Some of them have multiple Twitter accounts
for different purposes. We include all accounts related. This
results in 78 Democratic senator accounts, 102 Republican
senator accounts, 415 Democratic representative accounts,
and 350 Republican representative accounts. We collect their
tweets posted during the desired time span with the Python
package GetOldTweets3. To find those tweets related to
both the pandemic and China, we follow the same way the
original dataset is collected and filtered. After that, we apply
our aspect-based sentiment analysis model to the tweets of
interest.
Aspect Preferences of the Two Parties
We first look at the aspect preferences of the congress members from the two parties. It can be concluded from Table 3
that both Democratic and Republican congress members
take Chinese politics and foreign affairs as their top agendas.
But for democrats, racism is even a more salient aspect than
the two above. In terms of quantity, Republican congress

States. The lines were smoothed with 7-day average.
members tweet much more on China in COVID-19 than
their Democratic counterparts.
By taking a closer look at the chronological tendencies of
aspect mentions, as in Fig. 6, we find that racism regularly
appears in Democrats’ agendas, but only greatly rise in
March for Republicans, when it becomes a controversial
topic. In addition, Republicans show a sharp growth in
their mentions of Chinese politics and foreign affairs, as is
the case with the public. However, unlike the public, the
U.S. politicians do not show a great interest in the epidemic
situation and anti-epidemic measures of China even at the
beginning of the time span.
Sentiments of the Two Parties
Heterogeneity also emerges when we look at the sentiments
of tweets from the two parties, as shown in Fig. 7. For
democrats, the non-negative sentiment is mostly above the
negative, but starts to occasionally give way to the negative
since mid-April. For republicans, the negative sentiment is
almost always stronger than non-negative. The comparison
between the two parties, to some degree, display the polarization.
Polarization arises in the nature of the western democracies where multiple parties compete with each other for
votes and has been observed in many studies [23] [24] [25].
Our analysis confirms this polarity in the case of China-

since it is also one of the most followed media Twitter accounts in the U.S. However, it only posts hyperlinks leading
to their website without texts in their tweets and regularly
deletes old tweets, making it infeasible to analysis. We use
GetOldTweets3 to fetch the tweets posted from January 22
to May 21 by these accounts in the same way as the tweet

related issues during COVID-19 pandemic. For Republicans,
it may be an effective way to blame the domestic damage of
the epidemic on China. Meanwhile, democrats appears to
be more neutral or even positive when it comes to China
since they are not in charge of the White House.
Despite the polarity of their sentiments toward China,
since Republicans have been dominating the voice from the
congress on Twitter, the overall sentiment from the congress
has been mostly negative on the social media platform. The
growing negative sentiment toward China is in line with
what we have seen in the public.

Aspect Preferences in Media Tweets
We first explore which of the aspects are of the most interest
in the media. From Table 4, we find that both country’s
media pay more attention to the epidemic situation and antiepidemic measures in China.

(a) U.S. media

Image in English Media

Media is believed to have a great power of shaping people’s mind about the outside world [26]. That explains
why, traditionally, country image studies are conducted by
analyzing the contents of news media [27]. Assuming the
tweets posted by media can summarize their perspectives
in their regular channels, we investigate China’s image in
the English media by analyzing their tweets.
Tweet Collection for English Media
U.S. and U.K. media are unarguably dominant in the English media world due to their roles in the two waves
of globalization. Since we are only concerned about the
portrayal of China in English, we hand-pick four U.S. media
accounts and five U.K. media accounts to include into our
analysis. For the U.S. media, we choose ABC (@ABC), New
York Times (@nytimes), Washington Post (@washingtonpost), and Wall Street Journal (@WSJ). For their U.K. counterparts, BBC Breaking News (@BBCBreaking), BBC News
(World) (@BBCWorld), The Guardian (@guardian), Financial Times (@FinancialTimes), and Sky News (@SkyNews)
are chosen. The accounts chosen are those related to our

We further investigate the dynamics of the media’s aspect preferences in Fig. 8. As the epidemic gets gradually
contained in China, we observe a decline in the media’s
reporting of Chinese epidemic situation. Coverage of antiepidemic measures decreases over time in U.S. media as
well. A growing proportion of foreign affairs coverage in
U.K. media can be discovered since April. These tendencies
are in line with what we observed in the case of general
Twitter users.

Sentiments in Media Tweets
From Fig. 9, we see that for both U.S. and U.K. media,
non-negative sentiments are the majority of the sentiments
in their news reporting. However, as the non-negative reporting shrinks in number, the negative tweet counts stay
stable, leading to an increase in the proportion of negative
coverage. This is alarming as news professionalism requires
objectivity and neutrality, which is not what we see in their
China reporting.

on Twitter. This is crucial to understanding how country
image is constructed. Despite the fact that our research is
conducted on a social media platform, the role of media
cannot be neglected in the shaping of country image and it
is of interest to understand how traditional media and users
of social media interact with each other, shaping another
country’s image together.

media’s and the public’s tweet aspects. We restrict the
causality lag to one day. The greater the F statistic is, the
smaller the p-value, the more significant the effect is.

We employ Granger causality tests [32] to capture this
bidirectional agenda-setting effect on Twitter quantitatively.
Granger causality tests are a type of hypothesis tests that
determine if a time series is useful for forecasting another. It
has been successfully applied to agenda-setting researches
on Twitter [33]. We perform the test on each of the aspects
and the aspect-level sentiments, which corresponds to the
object agenda-setting and attribute agenda-setting, respectively. In this study, we only test in U.S. media because they
are presumably more influential than the British counterparts in the English Twitter world.

Agenda-setting Between the Media and the Public
As we have seen previously, the media’s aspect preferences
share some common characteristics with the public’s. This
drives us to think about the relationship between news
reporting and the public’s attention.
Agenda-setting is one of the most well-known theories
in the field of communication. First identified in the 1968
U.S. Presidential election, the theory predicts that the media
has the power to decide what the audience think about [28].
Since then, numerous studies have tested the theory in
different political, social, and cultural environments [29]
and even broadens its meaning by stating that the media not
only decides what we think about, but also decides how we
think of them [30]. These two levels of agenda-setting are
called object agenda-setting and attribute agenda-setting,
respectively.
The advent of social media has greatly transformed the
way people receive information as well as how they shape
their understanding of the world. Agenda-setting still exists
in social media, but occurs in both directions [31]. In other
words, the media is still setting the audience’s agenda, but
the audience is also setting that of the media. However,
the study only investigates U.S. domestic affairs, which is
largely different from the case in our research. Therefore, we
test how agenda-setting functions in COVID-19 pandemic

Table 5 and Table 6 show the results of Granger causality
test. From Table 5, we can find that the public is successful in
setting the media’s agendas in all six aspects. In comparison,
the media fails to set the public’s agenda in Chinese politics
and Chinese foreign affairs. We interpret the common patterns shared by these ideology-related aspects as a result of
the current prevalence of populism in the West [34]. From
table 6, we discover that the agenda-setting effects disappear
for many aspects when it comes to sentiment transferal.
Only in the aspect of anti-epidemic measures do we observe
a bidirectional agenda-setting effect that happens for both
negative and non-negative sentiments. To make a conclusion, the public and the media still share a mutual flow
of object agendas, but when it comes to sentiment, that is
attribute agendas, a gap lies between them.
These findings help reach a deeper understanding of
how the image of China is constructed in English Twitter
world. The public tends to retrieve factual knowledge from
the media about the epidemic in China and, in return,
decides what the media reports in both ideological and
factual dimensions. Meanwhile, the media’s and the public’s
opinions toward the aspects of China do not persuade each
other, but rather form their own opinions about certain
things, except in the aspect of anti-epidemic measures. This
also justifies the necessity of our study, which investigates
country image directly from the public’s opinion rather than
merely from the reporting of the media.

Image among Social Bots

Social bots on Twitter have long been an important topic in
social media research as they are known to “spread spam”,
“illicitly make money”, or “try to influence conversations”
on Twitter [35]. Previous studies reveal that social bots are
more likely to post politics-related contents when it comes
to China [36]. How do bots behave in COVID-19? In this
section, we offer a series of analysis to answer that question.
Bot Identification
Before analyzing the bots’ behaviors, we identify bots with
Botometer [37]. Botometer is an online Twitter bot detection
service that has been widely used in studies to identify
social bots [38], [39], and [36]. We sample 120, 000 users who
have posted tweets about China in the epidemic from our
dataset. By testing them with Botometer, we identify 4, 902
(4.09%) bot accounts. It should be noted that 4, 388 accounts
in the sample are set to “protected”. Thus we are unable to
judge whether they are bots or not.
Aspect Preference Comparison Between Bots and General Users
We first investigate bots’ aspect preferences by comparing
the percentages of different aspects discussed by bots with
those of general users. As shown in Table ??, social bots are
more likely to post about Chinese politics and its measures
against the epidemic than general Twitter users, according
to t-tests.
Sentiment Comparison Between Bots and General
Users
Next, we compare the sentiments of each aspect between
bots and general users. We also perform t-tests to discover
the aspects that bots have significantly different sentiment
polarities from general users. As in Table ??, social bots
are more negative than general Twitter users in terms of

epidemic situation, anti-epidemic measures, racism, and
overall polarity.

R ELATED W ORK

In this section, we will introduce two sides of related work,
country image, and aspect-based sentiment analysis.
5.1

Country Image

Country image is an issue that has been widely studied in
social sciences. Here, we will focus on three major topics, the
theories behind country image studies, the image of China,
and the relationship between epidemics and country image.
Traditionally, inquiries into country image are mainly
done by analyzing the media’s portrayal of the country. One
reason is that the reportings of media are believed to be a
representation of the world. Another reason is the framing
theory, which believes that people share a mental structure
that helps them make sense of the world, and, at the same
time, the media leverages this structure to provide news
stories to their audience [40].
As for China, Liss [41] and Peng [1] are among the
first to explore its image in American media since the new
century. Afterward, Zhang [42] studies China’s image in
British newspapers. To summarize their researches, since
China’s adoption of the Reform and Opening-up strategy
and China’s relationship with the world grows tighter,
western media has been paying more coverage to Chinarelated contents and displays a diversity of dimensions in
China, as opposed to the “Red China” stereotype. However,
as the overall national power of China grows, “China threat”
is also gaining popularity [43].
The advent of social media has provided the convenience
of measuring public opinions directly. As mentioned in
Section 1, Xiang [2] was among the first to explore China’s
image on social media. Social media users showed an even

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015

more diverse perspective when posting about China than
traditional media. However, they are still repeating the
stereotypes of China’s political system and ideology. Later
study uses more sophisticated computational methods to
explore the topics and sentiments expressed on Twitter and
finds that politics is still the most discussed topic about
China [13].
Next, we will discuss the relationship between epidemics
and country image. On the one hand, the way a government
handles such situations may have a direct influence on its
country image, as suggested by Lin [9]. On the other hand,
the naming of a new disease may also carry judgments over
a country and have influence on those who are exposed
to these namings. Vigs [44] analyzes the different unofficial
names of A(H1N1), such as “Mexican Flu”, “Swine Flu”,
“Novel Flu”, and reaches the conclusion that “naming is
framing”. Schein et al. [45] also studies the naming of this
disease, and argues that inappropriate naming of the disease
can lead to racism and xenophobia.
Therefore, our study analyzes China’s country image
in COVID-19 pandemic with Twitter data since it is both
typical and special, and prone to change. In addition, none
of the studies mentioned above conducts an aspect-level
sentiment analysis. To our best knowledge, this is the first
study that looks into country image in such a fine-grained
manner.
5.2

Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis

Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) attempts to analyze the sentiments of a text on different aspects of an
object. It has long been studied and has developed into
several variations. Two main categories are the one where
the aspects are expected to appear in the text and the one
where they are classes instead of terms.
For the first category where the aspect terms are in
the text, many researchers have applied the deep neural
network to this task because of its strong ability in representation learning. Fan et al. [46] introduce a multi-grained
attention network that captures the interaction between
aspect and context. Sun et al. [47] use a convolution over the
dependency tree. Chen and Qian [48] employ capsule network to incorporate document-level knowledge. In addition
to these works where aspects are predefined words, He et
al. [49] design a message passing architecture that enables
the model to extract the aspects from text and detect the
sentiment simultaneously. Xu et al. [50] first employ BERT
to solve the problem. Different from them, in our study, the
aspect terms may not appear in the text, which falls into the
second category of ABSA.
In the second category, the aspects are fixed classes.
Brun et al. [51] and Mohammad et al. [52] adopt traditional
feature-engineering based methods to solve this variation of
ABSA. These methods can be met with obstacles dealing
with tweets, which may include grammar and spelling
errors [53], as well as complex social constructs. As mentioned before, pretrained language models such as BERT has
achieved state-of-the-art performance in many downstream
tasks. Sun et al. [16] utilize BERT and convert it into a
sentence-pair classification task, which achieves state-of-theart performance. Inspired from them, we apply BERT to

10

learn the text representation and propose a two-stage model
to detect the aspect and classify the sentiment, respectively,
which achieves better performance in the exploration of
country image as shown in Table 2. Apart from these,
a series of studies [54], [55], [56] go further to extract
multiple targets before analyzing their aspect-level sentiments, known as targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis
(TABSA), while we focus on the investigation of China’s
image in this study.

C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK

In this study, we examine China’s image in COVID-19 pandemic on the aspect level with data from Twitter. The image
among several different groups of Twitter users, namely
the public, the U.S. Congress members, the English media,
and social bots on Twitter are investigated by analyzing
their aspect preference and sentiment distributions. What’s
more, by identifying the chronological causality between the
public and the media, we further discover how the country
image is constructed and find that the public perception of
China shapes and is shaped by the news coverage of China
at the same time. This study also demonstrates how aspectbased sentiment analysis can be applied in social science
studies, with the study of country image as a case.
For future works, we will continue to explore the images
of other countries as well as the implications of country
image in international communication and foreign relations
during the pandemic and in the post-COVID-19 world. We
will also explore more sophisticated aspect-based sentiment
analysis methods as well as create larger labeled datasets to
achieve better performance and more convincing results.
