Abstract—Epidemic models play a key role in understanding
and responding to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. Widely
used compartmental models are static and are of limited use to
evaluate intervention strategies with the emerging pandemic.
Applying the technology of data assimilation, we propose a
Bayesian updating approach for estimating epidemiological
parameters using observable information for the purpose of
assessing the impacts of different intervention strategies. We adopt
a concise renewal model and propose new parameters by
disentangling the reduction of instantaneous reproduction
number 𝑹𝒕 into mitigation and suppression factors for quantifying
intervention impacts at a finer granularity. Then we developed a
data assimilation framework for estimating these parameters
including constructing an observation function and developing a
Bayesian updating scheme. A statistical analysis framework is
then built to quantify the impact of intervention strategies by
monitoring the evolution of these estimated parameters. By
Investigating the impacts of intervention measures of European
countries, the United States and Wuhan with the framework, we
reveal the effects of interventions in these countries and the
resurgence risk in the USA.

I. INTRODUCTION

n response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have
taken non-pharmaceutical intervention measures. Common
measures include travel restriction, school and non-essential
business closure and social distancing, as well as early isolation
of confirmed patients. Recently, as the first-wave epidemic
peak has faded away in many countries, the accumulated
observations of epidemic growth [1] and corresponding
intervention policies [2] shed more insights on how the
interventions worked. Meanwhile, many governments have
switched into the phase to reopen economic and social
activities, with attention on tamping down possible resurgences.
However, the recent second-wave outbreak in some countries
and regions (e.g. the United States, Hong Kong) alerts us to
monitor the epidemic evolution carefully while intervention
measures are being relaxed.

Mathematical models play a key role in understanding and
responding to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic [3]–[5].
Compartmental models (e.g. SIR, SIER) and time-sinceinfection models (i.e. renewal process-based models) are the
two well-known approaches describing the underlying
transmission dynamics [6], [7]. The compartmental models
describe the transmission among sub-populations while the
renewal process-based approach starts from the inter-individual
transmission. Despite different nomenclatures and applications,
each model contains parameters characterizing the epidemic
dynamics. One of the most well-known parameters is the
reproduction number 𝑅, which represents the average number
of secondary cases that would be induced by an infected
primary case [8]. This key parameter is related to the final
epidemic size of infectious disease [9]. Intervention measures
aim to maintain the reproduction number under one so that the
epidemic can be contained along with time. Thus, estimation of
time-varying 𝑅 will reflect the impacts of intervention.
The basic reproduction number 𝑅! is the reproduction
number at the beginning of the epidemic outbreak, when the
susceptible population is approximately infinite and without
intervention measures. When various intervention measures are
being introduced, the instantaneous reproduction number 𝑅"
(also called effective reproduction number) is of greater
interest. To gain insights into epidemic evolution, most existing
studies such as [3], [10] focus on estimating time-varying
instantaneous reproduction number 𝑅" . 𝑅" is defined as the
average number of secondary cases that would be generated by
an infected primary case at a time 𝑡 when conditions remained
the same thereafter [8], reflecting the real-time transmission
dynamics. This could help governments to monitor the
evolution of COVID-19 and update intervention policies
accordingly [11].
However, the nowcasting of 𝑅" from reported data is not an
easy task. Several approaches have been proposed to estimate
𝑅" with different advantages [12]–[14], but the timeliness and
accuracy are still of concern. Nowcasting results are affected by
different factors, such as assumptions of the epidemic models,
statistical inference methods and uncertainty of data resources.
Inappropriate interpretation or imprecise estimation of 𝑅" are

criticized for providing misleading information [15]. For
example, the nowcasting from reported confirmed cases will
fall behind the nowcasting from onset data because there is a
delay from symptom onset to case report. We hypothesize that
more detailed characteristics of the time-varying infectiousness
profile could be estimated from the publicly available reports
(e.g., death data, confirmed data, onset data and laboratory data)
and help better understand and evaluate the efficiency of
interventions.
In this study, we propose a comprehensive Bayesian updating
scheme for reliable and timely estimation of parameters in
epidemic models. The transmission dynamics are modelled as
a concise renewal process with time-varying parameters. To
monitor the evolving impacts, more fine-grained modelling of
the transmission dynamics is required. Instead of the wellknown 𝑅" , we introduce two complementary parameters, the
mitigation factor ( 𝑝" ) captures the effect of shielding
susceptible population (e.g. through social distancing), and the
suppression factor ( 𝐷" ) captures the effect of isolating the
infected population (e.g. through quarantine) to stop virus
transmission. We propose a novel method to estimate these
parameters by taking the data assimilation approach of using
Bayesian updating methods. We use daily reports of confirmed
cases as the observation. A deconvolution method is used to
build an observation function to estimate the infection cases by
adjusting the incubation time and report delay. The evolution of
the time-varying infectiousness profile (i.e. 𝑝" and 𝐷" ) is
estimated from the adjusted epidemic curve through a Bayesian
approach of assimilation. Such a fine-grained infectiousness
profile enables us to quantify the impacts of various
intervention measures in a comprehensive way.
The paper is structured as follows: We introduce the related
work in Section II. In section III, we present the overview of a
time-varying renewal process model where the two parameters
𝑝" and 𝐷" are proposed. In section IV, we present in detail the
Bayesian updating scheme for estimating the dynamic
parameters. In section V, we develop a statistical analysis
method of assessing the intervention impacts based on the
estimated results and the report of intervention policies. In
section VI, as applications of our approach, we investigate the
impacts of intervention measures of European countries, the
United States and Wuhan to illustrate the importance of this
development.
II. RELATED WORK
At the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China,
compartmental models (e.g. SIR, SEIR model) have been used
to investigate the epidemic dynamics [16]–[18], where the
basic reproductive number was estimated from the models with
static parameters. With the spread of COVID-19 worldwide,
renewal process-based models (i.e. time-since-infection model)
are also being widely used in the study of COVID-19. The R
package ‘EpiEstim’ [12], [13] is the most widely used in
estimating the time-varying 𝑅" with a sliding window. In [10],
‘EpiEstim’ was applied to infer 𝑅" via the discrete renewal
process for policy impact assessment. Similar work has been

done in [3] to infer 𝑅" using ‘EpiEstim’ from laboratoryconfirmed cases in Wuhan and hence evaluated the impact of
non-pharmaceutical public health interventions. The work in
[11] has pointed out that the infection data is usually not
available and death data was used as observation for 𝑅"
updating. Instead of simply applying ‘EpiEstim’, they estimated
𝑅" by employing the renewal equation as a latent process to
model infections and connecting the infections to death data via
a generative mechanism. However, the estimated 𝑅" is in a
piecewise form and the number of changing points was
assumed to be determined by the imposed interventions. [19]
estimates 𝑅" from the death data as well while linking the
disease transmissibility to mobility using the renewal equation.
In general, [11] and [19] explicitly formulated the 𝑅" ’s updating
function by introducing external factors (e.g. interventions and
mobility). Thus, the estimated 𝑅" curve is largely constrained
by the factors that are considered in the model.
Data Assimilation [20] lends itself naturally to this problem
since it provides a framework to enable dynamically updating
the model states and parameters when new observations
become available while also taking into account model and
observation uncertainty. Data assimilation technologies, such
as Kalman filter and variational method [21], have been widely
used in signal tracking, oceanology, environment monitoring
and weather forecasting where physical models and observation
data are assimilated to produce accurate prediction. Data
assimilation for epidemiological modelling was first proposed
in [22] where compartment models were used as the underlying
model for assimilation. In [25] and [26], estimating timevarying parameters in the compartment models was further
investigated. To the authors’ best knowledge, our work is the
first study of applying data assimilation to the renewal processbased model.
III. EPIDEMIC MODELLING OF COVID-19 TRANSMISSION
In this section, we propose a time-varying renewal process
with two complementary parameters 𝑝" and 𝐷" to model the
evolving infectiousness profile. We adopted a time-varying
renewal process for epidemic modeling. The renewal process
[8] of infectious disease transmission is:
#

𝐼(𝑡) = + 𝐼(𝑡 − 𝜏) 𝛽(𝜏)𝑑𝜏
!

(1)

where 𝐼(𝑡) is the incident infection on time 𝑡 and 𝛽(𝜏) is the
infectiousness profile. The infectiousness profile means a
primary case who was infected 𝜏 time ago (i.e. with the
infection-age 𝜏) can now generate new secondary cases at a rate
of 𝛽(𝜏) , describing a homogenous mixing process. The
infectiousness profile 𝛽(𝜏) is related to biological, behavioral
and environmental factors. We can calculate the reproduction
number 𝑅 as the area under curve of 𝛽(𝜏), which is the overall
number of secondary cases infected by a primary case. Further,
𝛽(𝜏) can be rewritten as:
𝛽(𝜏) = 𝑅 ∙ 𝑤(𝜏)
(2)
where the unit-normalized transmission rate 𝑤(𝜏) is the
probability density function of generation time, i.e. the interval
between the primary infection and the secondary infection. In

3
the early stage without intervention, the infectiousness profile
remains time-independent as the baseline 𝛽! (𝜏) which
describes the transmission dynamics when the susceptible
population is infinite. The corresponding 𝑅 is the well-known
basic reproduction number 𝑅! . In reality, the infectiousness
profile 𝛽(𝜏) will evolve with time 𝑡, therefore we introduce
𝛽" (𝜏) to address the change in its distribution caused by
intervention measures.
To quantify the impacts of intervention measures to the
evolution of 𝑅" , we propose two factors: suppression and
mitigation to disentangle the intervention effects. Here we use
two complementary metrics 𝑝" and 𝐷" modelling the
suppression and mitigation factors respectively, as illustrated in
Figure 1.

Fig. 1. Disentangling the reduction of reproduction number into mitigation
and suppression factors.

The suppression effects mainly shorten the infectious period
of the infected population, corresponding to the truncation of
𝛽(𝜏) along the horizontal axis. We use a time-varying
parameter 𝐷" to denote the effective infectious window induced
by suppression. The mitigation effects attenuate the overall
infectiousness by shielding the susceptible population,
corresponding to the scaling on the vertical direction. We
introduce another time-varying parameter 𝑝" to describe this
attenuation effect induced by mitigation. Formally, we
parameterize the evolution of the infectiousness profile as:
𝛽 (𝜏) ∙ 𝑝"
𝜏 < 𝐷"
𝛽" (𝜏) = 4 !
(3)
0
𝜏 ≥ 𝐷"
Accordingly, the instantaneous reproductive number 𝑅" can
be derived:

𝑅" = 𝑝" ∙ + 𝛽! (𝜏)𝑑𝜏

IV. ADAPTIVE PARAMETER ESTIMATION
We aim to develop a comprehensive framework to estimate
parameters of renewal process models using Bayesian updating
approach of data assimilation, especially the three key
parameters: < 𝑅" , 𝑝" , 𝐷" >. The estimation is essential for
quantify the impacts of different interventions through
monitoring the evolution of < 𝑅" , 𝑝" , 𝐷" >. This framework
contains building an observation function to map observations
to model state, modelling and Bayesian updating as shown in
Figure 2 and 3. By applying the observation function, we
reconstruct the number of daily infections from reports of
confirmed cases, taking into account the incubation time and
report delay with a deconvolution algorithm. Then <𝑅" , 𝑝" , 𝐷" >
is estimated through a Bayesian approach of data assimilation.
A. Reconstruction of daily infection from reported cases
In data assimilation, model states and parameters can be
updated using new observation data. It is important for
parameter estimation that proper observation is chosen, and an
observation function can be built which maps observations to a
state variable (usually regarded as the output of the model).
In this study, the observations we have chosen are from the
reported number of confirmed cases. The model output is daily
infection incidence through the renewal process. However, such
observations experience an inevitable time delay between the
actual infection time and the reporting date (Figure 2). This
includes an incubation time (i.e. the period between infection
and onset of symptoms) and confirmation period (i.e. the period
between onset and officially reported after being tested). The
confirmed cases reported on time 𝑡 were actually infected
within a past period and the reported number is the convolution
result of the historical daily infection.

Therefore, the impact of intervention measures on
𝑅" reduction is disentangled: mitigation factor 𝑝" attenuates the
overall infectiousness through shielding the susceptible
population and suppression factor 𝐷" shortens the infectious
period through isolating the infected population. It is noted that
the 𝑅" can be derived from 𝑝" and 𝐷" which provide more

deconvolution algorithms. The time delay between the infection and onset and
report is demonstrated (top). The estimated distribution between infection and
report is presented which is used for deconvolution (bottom).

Here, we define an observation function to reconstruct the

4
daily infection instances from the confirmed cases using the
deconvolution technique with Richardson-Lucy (RL) iteration
method [25]. We use the incubation period calculated by
Ferretti et al.[5], which is a lognormal distribution with a mean
of 5.5 days and a standard deviation of 2.1 days. We use the
confirmation period previously reported by Leung et al. [10],
which is a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.9 days and a
standard deviation of 3.3 days. Sampling from these two
sequential distributions, we estimated the discrete interval
distribution 𝑠(𝜏) for 𝜏 ∈ {0, 𝑑} from infection to report (Figure
2). Denoting the epidemic curve of reported infection cases
𝐼?%:' = {𝐼?% , 𝐼?( , … , 𝐼?" } and the epidemic curve of confirmed cases
𝐶%:' = {𝐶% , 𝐶( , … , 𝐶" } , the reported infection with an
observation process of past infections can be modelled as a
Poisson process:

where 𝑁 is the total number of data points. It is of note that
the reported number of confirmed cases constitute the lower
bound of the real infection due to the lack of mass test and the
existence of asymptomatic cases. However, as long as the
detection rate remains consistent, the scaling of reconstructed
data does not affect the following inference of transmission
dynamics.
B. Bayesian Updating for Parameter Estimation
Following the Bayesian updating approach of data
assimilation, we propose an instantaneous estimation method.
For the defined epidemiology renewal process, the daily
incident infection 𝐼" is the state variable and can be assimilated
from the reconstructed infection data from observation. The
evolution of the state 𝐼" is governed by the renewal process with
the time-varying infectiousness profile 𝛽" (𝜏) , parameterized
with 𝑝" and 𝐷" . Here we present a Bayesian framework to
monitor the evolution of 𝑝" and 𝐷" using the daily reports of
confirmed cases (Figure 3).

Fig. 3. Illustration of the Bayesian updating framework for estimating
suppression and mitigation factors. We employ a two-level hierarchical model:
For each time step, the low-level model (i.e. renewal process) provides the
likelihood of 𝑝! , 𝐷! (green). The posterior (orange) is calculated through the
element product of the likelihood and the prior (blue) from the previous time
step. To generate the prior for next time step, we use the high-level model (i.e.
the transformation T) to induce the evolution of parameters. The high-level
model is a piecewise gaussian random walk process where the fluctuations of
𝑝! and 𝐷! differ before and after an intervention time. The instantaneous
reproduction number 𝑅! can be derived from the posterior distribution of 𝑝!
and 𝐷! .

Our updating scheme employs a two-level hierarchical
model for the inference of time-varying parameters [26]. Let us
denote the observed daily incidence of infection till time step 𝑡
as 𝐼?%:' = {𝐼?% , 𝐼?( , … , 𝐼?" }. Suppose pT𝛉')% |𝐼?%:')% W is the estimated
distribution of 𝛉 = [𝑝, 𝐷]1 at time step 𝑡 − 1 . Under the
assumption of consistent detection rates, the observed daily
incidence 𝐼?" also satisfies the renewal process. The low-level
model predicts the observation (i.e. reconstructed daily
infection) given a parameter set through the renewal process:
")%

pT𝐼?' Z𝛉' , 𝐼?%:')% W ~ 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 = J 𝛽" (𝑘; 𝛉' )𝐼?")* ) (8)
*2%

where a Poisson process of observing the infected cases is
assumed. This describes the likelihood of observing the new
incidence data given history observations and parameter value
𝛉' . The high-level model describes the evolution of the model
parameters 𝑝" and 𝐷" through transforming the joint
distribution:
pT𝛉' Z𝐼?%:')% W = T ∘ pT𝛉')% Z𝐼?%:')% W
(9)
where T(. ) is a transformation function defining the
temporal variations of the 𝛉. The prior knowledge of parameter
distribution is transferred to the next time step 𝑡 by the highlevel model T. Under the scenario without interventions, the
parameters 𝑝" and 𝐷" fluctuate around the baseline values.
Therefore, we can assume a random walk of 𝛉 in the parameter
space as the high-level model. The update of joint parameter
distribution is by convoluting with a Gaussian kernel with
variance 𝜎% . When the intervention is introduced on time 𝑑, the
random walk of 𝛉 is altered where the variance of the Gaussian
kernel will become 𝜎( . The transformation T(. ) is defined as:

5
p(𝛉) ∗ K 3" (𝛉)
𝑡<𝑑
T ∘ p(𝛉) = a
(10)
p(𝛉) ∗ K 3# (𝛉)
𝑡≥𝑑
where K 3" (𝛉) and K 3# (𝛉) are the Gaussian kernels before
and after the deployment of intervention at time 𝑑. This highlevel model includes three hyperparameters: variances before
and after intervention: 𝜎% and 𝜎( , and the change-point time 𝑑.
Let us denote the hyperparameters 𝜼 = [𝜎% , 𝜎( , 𝑑]1 . After seen
the latest observation 𝐼?' , the posterior estimation of 𝛉 is update
by the Bayes rule:
T ∘ pT𝛉')% Z𝐼?%:')% W ∙ pT𝐼?' Z𝛉' , 𝐼?%:')% W
pT𝛉' Z𝐼?%:' W =
(11)
pT𝐼?' Z𝐼?%:")% W
This step reflects the Bayesian principle in the key updating
step in Kalman filtering [21]. Unlike the Kalman filtering
method where uncertainty is explicitly modelled through a
covariance matrix under the Gaussian assumption, we directly
use posterior probability to capture the uncertainty of
estimation. The posterior is usually intractable but can be
approximated through grid-based methods. Given a set of
hyperparameters 𝜼- , the hybrid model evidence can be
calculated as [26]:
pT𝐼?%:' Z𝜼- W = + pT𝐼?%:' , 𝛉' Z𝜼- W𝑑𝛉'

(12)

Finally, the posterior estimation pT𝛉' Z𝐼?%:' W can be averaged
across the hyperparameter grids weighted by the hybrid model
evidence. The posterior mean and confidence intervals of 𝑝"
and 𝐷" as well as the corresponding 𝑅" are obtained in a
dynamic manner. The prior of 𝑅! at the first timestep is set
uninformative as a uniform distribution with the pre-set lower
and upper limits (e.g., the upper limit for the European countries
is set to 8 in the experiment). The shape of 𝛽! (𝜏) is adapted
from the distribution of generation time interval 𝑤(𝜏) reported
by Ferretti et al.[5] We applied the above framework to infer
the epidemic evolution in 14 European countries, states in the
US and Wuhan city, China in Section VI. The codes of the our
framework is released as an open-source package
(https://github.com/whfairy2007/COVID19_Bayesian).
V. EVALUATION OF INTERVENTION MEASURES
With the estimated results from the above Bayesian updating
scheme, now we can perform statistical analysis between the
evolution of the transmission dynamics and the implementation
of intervention measures. The whole framework containing
data reconstruction, dynamic modelling, Bayesian updating,
statistical analysis is presented in Figure 4. In this section, we
introduce the quantification of intervention measures and the
statistical method.
A. Data Source
For the observations, we use the aggregated data of publicly
available daily confirmed cases of 14 Europe countries
(Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland
and the United Kingdom) and 52 states of the United States
from John Hopkins University database [1]. The data include
the time series of confirmed cases from January 22nd to June
8th 2020 (accessed on June 9th 2020). Six states with

accumulated confirmed cases less than 1,000 are excluded from
the analysis. The daily number of onset patients in Wuhan is
adopted from the retrospective study by Pan et al. [3].

Fig. 4. Components of the quantification framework. The evolution of
mitigation and suppression factors are estimated using the infection data
reconstructed from the daily reported confirmed cases. Given the history of
government responses, the impacts of intervention measures are quantified by
correlating the inferred epidemic parameters to response levels.

The data of intervention measures in European countries are
collected from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response
Tracker [2], reporting the overall stringency index 𝑆" of
intervention measures during the analysis period (accessed on
June 9th 2020). This overall stringency index is calculated based
on the policy quantification of eight intervention measures (i.e.
School closing, Workplace closing, Cancel public events,
Restrictions on gatherings, Close public transport, Stay-athome requirements, Restrictions on internal movement and
International travel controls) and one health measure (i.e. public
info campaigns) to indicate the government response level of
intervention.
According to the normalized stringency index by Oxford
report [2], we categorized the dates into five response levels
(Level 0: 𝑆" ≤20%, minimal response for reference; Level 1:
20%<𝑆" ≤40%, soft response; Level 2: 40%<𝑆" ≤60%, strong
response; Level 3: 60%< 𝑆" ≤ 80% and Level 4:
80%< 𝑆" ≤ 100%, emergent responses). The representative
intervention measures for each response level were identified
based on the contribution to the stringency index 𝑆" .
B. Calculation of intervention policy indices
We categorize the dates within our analysis period in
European countries into five different response levels, based on
the overall stringency index 𝑆" . To identify the representative
measures of each response level, we calculate the quantification
indices of the eight intervention measures. Descriptions of the
eight intervention measures and the quantification methods are
provided in [2]. For each intervention measure, the Oxford
report provides an ordinal scale quantification 𝑣4," of the
strength of j-th policy implementation and a binary flag 𝑓4,"

6
representing whether it is implemented in the whole country on
time 𝑡. Following similar practice use in the Oxford report, we
normalize the implementation of each intervention measure as
max (0, 𝑣4," + 0.5𝑓4," − 0.5)
𝑃4," =
× 100%
(13)
𝑁4
where 𝑁4 is the maximum value of the indicator 𝑃4 . To assign
a label of response level to each measure, we calculate the
change of mean policy indices across different response levels.
The response level with the largest increase is considered as the
level that the measure belongs to (i.e. the measure is a
representative measure of this response level). For example, the
mean index of school closure showed the largest increase from
Level 0 to Level 1, so we consider this is a representative
measure of Level 1. The representative measures of each
response level are listed in Table 1.
C. Regression analysis of the intervention impacts
We performed a retrospective analysis of the time-varying
transmission dynamics during different response levels in
Europe countries. First, the evolution history of 𝑅" and the
overall stringency index 𝑆" are obtained using the above
framework. The stringency index 𝑆" is categorized into five
response levels. We fit a log-linear mixed-effect model, where
the logarithm of 𝑅" is the outcome variable and categorical
stringency index is the predictor. The logarithm is used to
obtain the intervention impacts on the relative change of 𝑅"
[27]. We performed a partial-pool analysis by assuming the
impacts of intervention measure (slopes) shared across all
selected European countries while the basic reproduction
number 𝑅! (intercept) varies due to environmental and social
factors. The regression formula is written as:
6

ln 𝑅4," = 𝑏! + J 𝑏* ∗ 𝐷4,* + 𝛾4 + 𝜖 𝑗 = 1,2, … ,14 (14)
*2%

where 𝑅4," is the estimated reproduction number of j-th
country, 𝑏! is the fixed effect term of ln 𝑅! and 𝑏* is the fixed
effects of interventions in response level 𝑘. 𝐷4,* is the dummy
variable that takes the value 1 if and only if the response status
is at Level k. 𝛾4 is the random effect term following zero-mean
Gaussian which explains the difference of ln 𝑅! across
countries and 𝜖 is the Gaussian error term. Equation 14
associates the relative changes in 𝑅 to the fixed effects of
response levels, and can be rewritten into its marginal form as:
6

𝑅 − 𝑅!
ln(1 +
) = J 𝑏* ∗ 𝐷*
𝑅!
*2%

(15)

Therefore, the relative change of 𝑅 due to the intervention
measures in k-th response level can be derived from 𝑏* (i.e.
∆𝑅/𝑅! = 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑏* ) − 1 ). Country-specific ln 𝑅! can be
estimated as 𝑏! + 𝛾4 at the Level 0. The statistical analysis is
performed using the R package ‘lme4’. The fixed effect is
considered significant with P value<0.05. The 95% confidence
intervals (CI) are estimated using bootstrap method. The
assumption of normality is checked by inspecting the quantilequantile plot of the residuals. The same procedure is also
applied to the analysis of 𝐷" and 𝑝" to quantify the suppression

and mitigation factors,
demonstrated in Table 1.

VI. RESULTS
A. Validation on simulated data
We simulated an artificial epidemic outbreak with a timevarying infectiousness profile using renewal process. The
generation time intervals were adapted from Ferretti et al.[5].
The simulation period includes 50 days and an intensive
intervention measure is induced on day 35 altering the
transmission dynamics. Before the intervention, the groundtruth 𝑅" followed Gaussian random walk with a mean of 2.5.
After the intervention (50% 𝑝" reduction and 67% 𝐷"
reduction), the mean of 𝑅" was reduced to 0.5 (black line).

Fig. 5. Validation of the proposed Bayesian updating scheme.

We validate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing the
sudden change of 𝑅" evolution induced by interventions, which
is hard to be detected by traditional sliding window-based
methods (Figure 5). We compared the results using our
approach (red line with 95% confidence intervals) to the results
computed by the R package ‘EpiEstim v2.2’ [12] (blue) which
is a sliding window-based method widely used for 𝑅"
estimation. We observed that the ground-truth 𝑅" is well
estimated within our confidence interval. In particular, the
sharp change of 𝑅" caused by the intervention is captured
immediately by our approach while there is a lag using the
sliding window-based method.
B. Evaluation of Intervention measures in Europe Countries
In this part, we applied the proposed framework to analyze
the epidemic evolution in the 14 European Countries and also
Wuhan. With the inferred <𝑅" , 𝑝" , 𝐷" >, we can then assess the
impacts of intervention measures.
Figure 6 demonstrates the reconstruction of daily infections
in the UK from the reported confirmed cases. The infected-toreport delay between report and infected time is composed of
the incubation period (a lognormal distribution with a mean of
5.5 days and a standard deviation of 2.1 days [5]) and the onsetto-report period (a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.9 days
and a standard deviation of 3.3 days [10]). The blue bars in
Figure 6 indicate the number of confirmed cases. After
deconvolving the confirmed numbers using infected-to-report
delay, we got the infected curve, which is colored in red in

7
Figure 6. To check the reliability of the deconvolution results,
we convolve the inferred infected curve (in red) with the
infected-to-report delay to recover the confirmed curve (in
black). We can see that the black curve matches well to the
original blue bars and is much smoother. With the above
observation, we can see the effectiveness of the infected curve
inference. Figure 7 shows the results of estimating 𝑅" of the UK
from the infected curve. The missing values in the infected
curve are replaced by the average mean of the neighbouring

incremental suppression effect. This observation shows a
consistency with the aim of representative intervention
measures on this level (e.g. cancelling public events,
restrictions on gathering and internal movements) to reduce the
contact rates among the population.
The emergent response (Level 3) shows substantial relative
reduction of reproductive number ( 𝑅" reduction 71%) with
suppression (𝐷" shortening 37%) and mitigation (𝑝" reduction
67%) effects, correlated to the intensive measures (e.g.
workplace closure and stay-at-home requirements). A similar
degree of reductions is found for Level 4 (𝑅" reduction 74%; 𝐷"
shortening 40%; 𝑝" reduction 70%) while the stringency of
intervention measures is higher. We find that our estimated
evolving patterns of 𝑝" and 𝐷" correspond well to the serial
strategies taken by some European countries, such as the
‘contain-delay-lockdown’ route taken in the UK.

deconvolution method.

To quantitatively show the impacts of different strength
levels of interventions, Table 1 summarizes the statistical
analysis results of 14 European countries. It shows different
reduction rates of <𝑅" , 𝑝" , 𝐷" > for different response levels.
The relative reduction of <𝑅" , 𝑝" , 𝐷" > compared to the minimal
response (Level 0 where 𝑅" is set to 𝑅! ) was estimated for each
response level. With soft response (Level 1), the corresponding
intervention measures (e.g. school closure, quarantine of
international arrivals from high-risk regions) are correlated with
a relative reduction of 𝑅" by 35% showing both strong
suppression effect (𝐷" shortening 22%) and mitigation effect
(𝑝" reduction 29%). With strong response (Level 2), the relative
reduction of 𝑅" increases to 60% with a strong mitigation effect
(𝑝" reduction 56%). But the suppression effect (𝐷" shortening
26%) is similar to that of Level 1, indicating marginal

Apart from the results of 14 European Countries, Figure 8
also shows the results of applying our method to the data from
Wuhan, where the greens bars indicate the posterior mean of 𝑅"
during the outbreak of COVID-19. We can see that at the early
stage of the pandemic, the 𝑅" levels are above 1. After the
lockdown intervention has taken effect, 𝑅" has experienced a
sharp decrease from 23rd Jan. When the centralized quarantine
policy has been enforced from the beginning of February, the
𝑅" values then largely remain below zero (the spike around 14th
Feb is due to misreporting).
Figure 9 compares the reductions in < 𝑅" , 𝑝" , 𝐷" > for
different response levels between European Countries and
Wuhan. From the analysis of Wuhan data, the strong impact of
lockdown is clearly demonstrated with the immediate relative
reduction of 𝑅" by 58%. We also observed that the combination
of lockdown, centralized quarantine and immediate admission
of confirmed patients starting from Feb 2nd in Wuhan was
associated with a more substantial relative reduction of 𝑅" with
strong suppression and mitigation effects.

limitations. Firstly, the reporting protocols and standards of
confirmed cases, as well as the detection rates, vary among
countries. However, as long as the reporting bias is consistent
over time, the inference results of 𝑝" , 𝐷" and 𝑅" should not be
affected. We also note that the implementation of multiple
intervention measures within a short interval makes it
challenging to quantify the impact of a single measure which
needs further statistical analysis.

C. Resurgence risks in United States
We also used the proposed framework to estimate the
epidemic evolution in different states of the United States. We
observed that, as of the week ending May 31st, the averaged
reproduction number 𝑅" in 30 states exceeds 1 (Figure 10).
These could be related to the recent lift of government
restrictions and alert us to take a close monitoring on the
epidemic evolution.
At the time of preparing this paper (June 18th 2020), 29 out
of the 30 states we alerted on 9th June 2020 have experienced
an increased number of daily confirmed cases compared to that
of May 31st, and 14 states have recorded all-time high after May
31st. When we prepare the final version in early August, this
alarming prediction of a second wave outbreak is unfortunately
proven true for all the states listed.
So far, the application of the framework to many countries
and the retrospective impact analysis of intervention measures
in European countries indicate the effectiveness of our
approach in monitoring 𝑅" . This can be further validated by
predicting the evolution of 𝑝" , 𝐷" and 𝑅" and projected
infections in future study. Our current study has several

In conclusion, we propose a comprehensive Bayesian
updating approach to timely estimate parameters of COVID-19
epidemic models. The disease transmission dynamics is
modelled by renewal equations with time-varying parameters.
Instead of purely focusing on estimating instantaneous
reproduction number 𝑅" , we introduce two complementary
parameters, the mitigation factor (𝑝" ) and the suppression factor
(𝐷" ), to quantify intervention impacts at a finer granularity. A
Bayesian updating scheme is adopted to dynamically infer
model parameters. By monitoring and analyzing the evolution
of the estimated parameters, impacts of intervention measures
in different response levels can be quantitatively assessed. We
have applied our method to European countries, the United
States and Wuhan, and reveal the effects of interventions in
these countries and the resurgence risk in the USA. Our work
opens a promising venue to inform policy for better decisionmaking in response to a possible second-wave outbreak.
