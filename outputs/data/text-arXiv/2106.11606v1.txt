Abstract
The current Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has exemplified the need for simple
and efficient prevention strategies that can be rapidly implemented to mitigate infection risks.
Various surfaces have a long history of antimicrobial properties and are well described for the
prevention of bacterial infections. However, their effect on many viruses has not been studied
in depth. In the context of COVID-19, several surfaces, including copper (Cu) and silver (Ag)
coatings have been described as efficient antiviral measures that can easily be implemented to
slow viral transmission. In this study, we detected antiviral properties against Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) on surfaces, which were coated with Cu
by magnetron sputtering. However, no effect of Ag on viral titers was observed, in clear contrast
to its well-known antibacterial properties. Further enhancement of Ag ion release kinetics based
on an electrochemical sacrificial anode mechanism did not increase antiviral activity. These
results clearly demonstrate that Cu and Ag thin film systems display significant differences in
antiviral and antibacterial properties which need to be considered upon implementation.

1. Introduction
Cu and Ag are known as antimicrobial agents for centuries, however, in the medical field these
metals have experienced a renaissance over the last years due to the increasing emergence of
antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Beside applications of these metals in numerous consumer
products they are used in various biomaterials or healthcare settings to prevent bacterial
colonization of implants and devices or to support hospital hygiene procedures to reduce
hospital-acquired infections. Both, Cu and Ag, exert broad antimicrobial activities (bacteria,
fungi and viruses) and show a low incidence to induce microbial resistance as both attack a
broad range of targets in microorganisms.[1–3] Especially the pandemic spread of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the disease COVID-19 has
exemplified the requirement for effective public health intervention strategies that contribute to
2

controlling virus transmission. However, the development of antiviral surfaces which are able
to inactivate adherent virus particles and thereby hinder virus transmission from contaminated
surfaces is challenging due to the different inherent properties of microbes compared to viruses.
The antibacterial activity of Ag is strongly related to the release of Ag ions (Ag+) which are
formed by oxidative dissolution, while in contrast, zero valent Ag (Ag0) exerts no comparable
antibacterial activity. [2,4–6] Ag+ ions interact with a variety of biomolecules within a cell such
as cell membrane and cell wall components, thiol ligands, e.g., sulfhydryl groups of metabolic
enzymes, or nucleic acids, and others. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
generated due to Ag+ ions which leads to harmful oxidative stress effects.[2,7,8] In general,
consequences are biomolecule damage and subsequent cellular dysfunctions which finally
inhibit bacterial proliferation up to bactericidal effects. The antibacterial efficiency of Ag can
be enhanced by an increase in the Ag+ releasing surface area by using e.g., Ag nanoparticles.[9]
In addition, recently, we presented a concept to enhance Ag+ release kinetics based on an
electrochemical sacrificial anode mechanism.[10–12] By combination of Ag with a more noble
metal (Au, Pt, Pd, or Ir) within an electrolytic environment (such as biological fluids) the less
noble Ag corrodes in favor of the more noble part (it is “sacrificed”). We have demonstrated
that such sacrificial anode surfaces exert much higher antibacterial effects compared to pure Ag
surfaces with much higher total Ag+ due to the electrochemically driven enhanced dissolution
of Ag. Based on these results we aimed at analyzing the antiviral properties of surfaces coated
with Cu or Ag as well as several Ag-based sacrificial anode surfaces including combinations of
Cu and Ag for possible synergistic effects and compare antiviral against antimicrobial
performance.

2. Results
The results were achieved using different sputtered thin film surfaces (for details see
Experimental Methods): (I) continuous and dense thin films of Ag and Cu (thickness 50 nm)
and (II) nanostructured surfaces with high surface areas. The latter were synthesized by (a)
sequentially depositing Ag on Pt, Cu on Ag or (b) by co-sputtering Ag and Pt as well as Cu and
Ag. We call the resulting surface structures “nanopatches”, i.e., nanoislands which are formed
by the two metals. In case of sequential sputtering (Ag on Pt, Cu on Ag) the elements tend to
be more separated as compared to co-sputtering which tends to mix the elements on the atomic
scale (Ag&Pt, Cu&Ag) and rather forms an alloy (forced solid solution) compared to the coexistence of elemental films (Ag on Pt, Cu on Ag). The latter is expected to have better
sacrificial anode properties. We synthesized nanopatches of two different thicknesses, which
offer different volumes of material (e.g., thin Ag/Pt vs. thick Ag/Pt) for releasing metal ions
(Table 1).
In order to qualitatively compare antimicrobial and antiviral properties of sputtered Ag and Cu
surfaces, we first evaluated the antibacterial properties of thin Ag/Pt and Ag/Cu sacrificial
anode nanopatches. Bacterial tests were performed with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)
using a drop-based experimental setup allowing analysis of planktonic and adherent bacteria.
Planktonic bacteria within the drop were quantified by plating on blood agar plates, while
adherent bacteria on the sample surface were visualized by fluorescence microscopy.
Pure Ti thin films as well as thin nanopatches of pure Pt, Ag, and Cu served as controls and
exhibited no significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus (Figure 1A). Similarly, bacterial
growth was not affected by co-deposited thin Ag/Pt nanopatches indicating the absence of a
sacrificial anode effect (Figure 1B). In contrast, sequentially-deposited thin Ag/Pt nanopatches
as well as thin Ag/Cu nanopatches both co- and sequentially-deposited, effectively prevented
bacterial growth after 24 h of incubation (Figure 1B).

As it is generally accepted that the antibacterial activity of Ag und Cu is strongly related to the
release of ions and their interaction with cellular components and processes, solutions of silver
acetate (AgAc) and copper sulfate (CuSO4) were used as ionic controls for the antibacterial
activity of Ag and Cu towards the gram positive bacteria S. aureus.[13,14] Significant
antibacterial effects were detected for AgAc at concentrations ≥ 1.0 µg/mL, whereas CuSO4
provoked significant effects starting at concentrations ≥ 5.0 µg/mL (Figure 2).
These results indicate that the absence of antibacterial effects of pure Ag and Cu nanopatches
are due to an insufficient ion release from these structures, while the combination of Ag and Pt
as well as Ag and Cu leads to enhanced antibacterial activity based on electrochemically driven
enhanced dissolution of Ag and Cu, respectively (Figure 1). Previously, we demonstrated such
sacrificial anode effects for nanoparticular and nanostructured Ag/Pt systems.[10,12,15] Regarding
the Ag/Cu system, in addition to a possible sacrificial anode effect of Ag on Cu, a combination
effect of the two antibacterial metals might be considered. [10,12]
After demonstrating antibacterial effects of sputtered Ag and Cu surfaces as well as ionic Ag
and Cu solutions, in accordance with previous results, we aimed in a next step at analyzing
potential antiviral effects of these surfaces against SARS-CoV-2. Viral contamination was
mimicked upon inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 onto surfaces for either 1 h or 24 h, before viral
titers were determined as TCID50/mL (Figure 3). While Ag nanopatches did not affect viral
infectivity, nanopatches with a thick layer of Cu reduced viral titers by 1 log10 when incubated
together with SARS-CoV-2 for 24 h (Figure 3A). An even more pronounced antiviral efficacy
was observed for thin Cu films sputtered on Si/SiO2 pieces after 1 h and 24 h of incubation
reducing viral titers for 3 log10 and 4.5 log10, respectively, whereas Ag films did not reduce viral
titers (Figure 3B). Interestingly, Cu&Ag and Cu on Ag nanopatches reversed the antiviral
properties of solely Cu, with almost no antiviral effect after 1 h and reduced antiviral activity
after 24 h incubation. While thin films reduced viral titers by 2.2 log10, thick films increased
virus inactivation resulting in reduction factors of 3.9 log10 (Figure 3C). This demonstrates that
5

pure Cu films offer the highest antiviral effect (Figure 3B). In contrast, co-deposited and
sequentially deposited Ag-Pt nanopatches did not reduce viral infectivity within 1 h incubation.
A mild antiviral effect (1 log10 reduction of viral titers) was observed after 24 h incubation with
thin Ag&Pt and thin Ag on Pt nanopatches (Figure 3D). In order to explain the observation
that Ag-coated surfaces do not affect viral infectivity, we used silver acetate solutions (AgAc)
as a reference to test antiviral properties of Ag at higher ion concentrations as compared to what
can be released from a thin film surface. We included concentrations ranging from 1 µg/mL up
to 50 µg/mL Ag and inoculated the solution with SARS-CoV-2 containing supernatant for 1 h
or 24 h before determining viral infectivity as TCID50/mL. Only concentrations equal to or
higher than 25 µg/mL displayed antiviral properties and completely abolished infectivity of
SARS-CoV-2, however, only upon prolonged incubation of 24 h (Figure 3E). In contrast, virus
exposure towards CuSO4 solution in a similar experimental setup had no effect on viral titers
(Figure 3F). In conclusion, we demonstrate a clear antiviral effect of Cu-coated surfaces
against SARS-CoV-2 within 1 h exposure, whereas Ag did not influence viral infectivity.

3. Discussion
Rapid and effective prevention measures are urgently needed in order to combat microbial and
viral diseases. Fomite transmission via contaminated surfaces was described for a variety of
microbes, including several viruses and has been discussed in the context of COVID-19. Even
though surfaces are believed to play a minor role for the spread of SARS-CoV-2, public health
intervention strategies still rely on disinfectant procedures in order to reduce viral transmission.
Various surface coatings exhibiting topographically and/or chemically induced antimicrobial
activity have been suggested, including nanostructured materials as well as materials containing
antimicrobial agents (e.g. antibiotics, antiviral drugs, nanoparticles) such as commercially
available antibacterial/antiviral foils, textiles, paints, and many more.[16,17] Although
disinfection can be effective in the prevention of infection spread, the biologically active agents
6

of many widely used surface and hand disinfectants might also be hazardous to humans and the
environment, especially at prolonged application or misuse. In particular, skin and ocular
irritation as well as chemical burns to the respiratory track might occur. Disruption of the
normal skin flora, which normally represents a protection barrier to harmful agents, can even
enhance the risk of infection.[18]
In line with van Doremalen et al., SARS-CoV-2 was less stable on sputtered Cu surfaces
compared to all other thin films of this study, although partially detectable after 24 h of
incubation.[19] A thicker film led to a more pronounced antiviral effect. However, combining
Cu with Ag by either co-sputtering or sequentially depositing Cu on Ag, reduced antiviral
effects monitored by limited dilution assays. Thin films of pure Ag or Ag-based sacrificial
anode nanopatches (Ag in combination with Pt) displayed no capacity to inactivate SARS-CoV2 (Figure 3 B-D). Only silver acetate solutions with concentrations ≥ 25 µg/mL resulted in a 4log reduction of viral titers when incubated for 24 h. Reducing the silver acetate concentration
or incubation period completely abolished any antiviral effects (Figure 3E). This means that
only very high concentrations of Ag ions have an effect on SARS-CoV-2.
These results clearly indicate differences between antiviral and antibacterial activities of Ag.
For inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 about 10-fold higher concentrations of Ag ions are required
compared to efficient antibacterial concentrations. The reason may be related to the difference
in the nature of viruses vs. bacteria. As living organisms, bacteria offer much more Ag-sensitive
metabolic processes such as energy generation or cell proliferation compared to a virus particle.
Furthermore, some bacteria such as S. aureus exhibit a significant inherent tolerance of growth
at high Cu concentrations.[20] However, a copper sulfate solution up to 50 µg/mL did not
inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3F). In our study the ionic Ag and Cu solutions had similar
concentration up to 50 µg metal/mL to allow direct comparison. Whereas ionic Ag is
antibacterial at concentrations of ≥ 1 µg/mL, ionic Cu is required at much higher concentrations
to inhibit bacterial growth (e.g. 10 mM CuSO4).[20,21] Huang et al. (2008) observed similar
7

differences in antibacterial efficiency between Ag and Cu ions, however, at lower total ion
concentrations due to the water test medium.[22] Thus, at equimolar concentrations Ag ions
shows better antibacterial performance compared to Cu ions. Virus inhibition by soluble Cu
ions might require higher concentrations above the used maximal values (50 µg/mL) in our
experiments.
In contrast to ionic species, antibacterial and antiviral activities of solid Ag and Cu sputtered
surfaces have led to different results. Nanopatches of pure Ag neither exhibit antibacterial nor
antiviral activities. Obviously, Ag ion release is insufficient under these experimental
conditions. To overcome this limited Ag ion release, the more active ion-releasing sacrificial
anode surfaces can be used as they exhibit much better antibacterial efficiency even at lower
total Ag content [10,12] as was also observed here for Ag/Pt samples (Figure 1). However, even
these antibacterial Ag/Pt samples failed to induce any antiviral effect which indicates again the
need of higher Ag ion concentrations to reach antiviral activity.
Remarkably, our study shows that solid-state Cu either as a dense film or as nanopatches is able
to induce antiviral activity, but not solid-state Ag. The antiviral effects are dependent on the
total Cu amount (thickness of the sputtered Cu) and on the time of sample exposure.
It was reported that solid-state cuprous compounds exhibit efficient antiviral activities, whereas
those of solid-state Ag are markedly lower.[23] In particular the inactivation of influenza virus
HA and NA surface proteins are affected by the exposure to Ag and Cu.[24] Solid-state Ag is
less susceptible than solid-state Cu to surface oxidation under the experimental conditions to
release ionic species.[25] It is known that several metabolic products of Cu such as cuprous oxide
(Cu2O), sulfide (Cu2S), or chloride (CuCl) exhibit high antiviral activities and Cu surfaces
retain their anti-infective properties even after oxide formation.[23,26]
Although there are numerous reports on antibacterial and antiviral effects of Ag or Cu and their
related compounds, a direct comparison of Ag and Cu is rarely found and a high variability of
the reported study methods makes such direct comparison difficult.[27]
8

Taken together, biocidal surfaces could provide constant antiviral and antibacterial efficacy
against reoccurring contamination, thus reducing the spread of certain pathogens, given that the
surface stays clean and is not used up, whereas surface disinfection has to be reapplied with
every contamination.[28] The antimicrobial activity of Cu-based materials and surfaces was
demonstrated against different pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, MRSA (meticillin-resistant
S. aureus), VRE (vancomycin resistant enterococci), and other nosocomial microbes, while
techniques such as cold-spray coating or Cu-impregnation would circumvent the need to
completely replace existing surfaces.[29–32] However, incubation periods greater than 1 h are not
applicable for many administrations and prevention measures should therefore be critically
evaluated with respect to the targeted pathogen.

4. Experimental Methods
Sputter deposition of thin films
Thin film samples were prepared by direct current magnetron sputtering in Ar atmosphere (0.5
Pa) at room temperature on thermally oxidized Si substrates (Si/SiO2, 4.4 mm x.4.4 mm), which
were placed on a rotating substrate plate. Sputter targets, 2-inch diameter, of Cu (purity 99.99%,
EvoChem), Ag (99.99%, EvoChem) and Pt (99.99%, ESG Edelmetall Services) were used.
Data on all films are listed in Table 1. The nominal thickness of the films was calculated from
the pre-determined sputter rates of the used elements and the indicated power levels.

Antibacterial tests
Bacterial tests were performed with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, DSMZ 1104) obtained
from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany).
S. aureus cultures were grown overnight in brain-heart infusion broth (BHI broth, bioMerieux,
Lyon, France) at 37 °C using a shaking water bath (JULABO GmbH, Seelbach, Germany) and
bacterial concentrations were determined by turbidity measurements (Densichek turbidity
photometer, bioMerieux). The adhesion and proliferation of S. aureus on the different
nanopatch samples were analyzed using a drop-based experimental setup as reported previously
[M. Köller 2015, M. Köller 2017].[10,11] Briefly, 30 µl of a bacterial solution in BHI broth
containing 104 cells per mL (CFU/mL) were placed in the middle of each test sample followed
by incubation for 24 h in a humid chamber (water saturated atmosphere) under cell culture
conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2). Subsequently, the drops were aspirated, serially diluted (1:104)
and plated on Columbia blood agar plates (bioMerieux) for quantitative analysis of planktonic
bacteria. Qualitative analysis of the adherent bacteria was performed by SYTO-9 staining
(Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and detected by fluorescence microscopy
(BX61 microscope, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany).
Silver acetate (AgC2H3O2, AgAc) and copper sulfate (CuSO4) solutions were used as ionic
controls for the antimicrobial activity of Ag and Cu, respectively. Each solution was prepared
in sterile ultrapure water and normalized to the total metal content (i.e., for example 100 µg/mL
AgAc contains 100 µg/mL Ag). Different bacterial concentrations (103, 104, 105 CFU/mL) of
S. aureus were incubated in BHI for 24 h with different concentrations of AgAc and CuSO4
solutions (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 25, 50 µg/mL) in 96-well microplates at a total sample volume
of 200 µL under cell culture conditions. Subsequently, quantification of viable cells was
performed by the AlamarBlue assay. Therefore, the bacterial suspensions were incubated with
20 µl of the AlamarBlue reagent (Invitrogen) until visible color change and the fluorescence
14

intensity was analyzed at 590 nm by a microplate reader (FLUOstar Optima, BMG LABTECH
GmbH, Ortenberg, Germany). The data of the treated cultures (mean ± SD) are given as
percentage of the untreated controls (bacteria cultured without AgAc or CuSO4).

Antiviral tests
To evaluate the inactivation capacity of thin films sputtered on Si/SiO2 pieces (see Sputter
deposition of thin films), 25 µl of SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Germany/BY-Bochum-1/2020;
GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_1118929; 8.8×10^6 TCID50/mL) was spotted in the middle of
each test sample and incubated for 1 h and 24 h at room temperature. Virus was recovered by
adding 225 µl of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, supplemented with 10 % (v/v)
fetal calf serum (FCS), 1 % (v/v) non-essential amino acids, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL
streptomycin and 2 mM L-Glutamine). Subsequently, viral titers were determined by an
endpoint dilution assay performed on Vero E6 cells (kindly provided by C. Drosten and M.
Müller) seeded at 5×10^4 cells/mL in DMEM one day prior titration. The remaining TCID50
was calculated according to Spearman and Kärber.
According to the antimicrobial tests silver acetate and copper sulfate solutions were used as
ionic controls. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 was spiked with different concentrations of AgAc and
CuSO4 solutions (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 25, 50 µg/mL) and was incubated for 1 h and 24 h at room
temperature. Remaining viral titers were again quantified by an endpoint dilution assay
followed by TCID50 calculation.

Statistics
Statistical analysis of antibacterial effects was performed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni
post hoc test. Statistical analysis of antiviral effects was performed by two-way ANOVA in a
mixed-effects analysis with Dunnet’s multiple comparison. p-Values ≤ 0.05 were considered as
statistically significant.
