Abstract
We introduce a new probabilistic model to estimate the real spread of the novel
SARS-CoV-2 virus along regions or countries. Our model simulates the behavior
of each individual in a population according to a probabilistic model through an
inverse problem; we estimate the real number of recovered and infected people
using mortality records. In addition, the model is dynamic in the sense that
it takes into account the policy measures introduced when we solve the inverse
problem. The results obtained in Spain have particular practical relevance: the
number of infected individuals can be 17 times higher than the data provided
by the Spanish government on April 26 th in the worst case scenario. Assuming
that the number of fatalities reflected in the statistics is correct, 9.8 percent
of the population may be contaminated or have already been recovered from
the virus in Madrid, one of the most affected regions in Spain. However, if we
assume that the number of fatalities is twice as high as the official numbers, the
number of infections could have reached 19.5%. In Galicia, one of the regions
where the effect has been the least, the number of infections does not reach 2.5
%. Based on our findings, we can: i) estimate the risk of a new outbreak before
Autumn if we lift the quarantine; ii) may know the degree of immunization of the
population in each region; and iii) forecast or simulate the effect of the policies
to be introduced in the future based on the number of infected or recovered
individuals in the population.

Introduction

The spread of the Coronavirus is generating an unprecedented crisis worldwide.
In Europe, for example, it is considered to be the most significant challenge
that the continent has faced since World War II. In the light of this situation
of emergency, the governments must work quickly to avoid the collapse of the
healthcare system, reduce the mortality associated with the virus, and avoid
the possible effects of an economic recession [1, 2].
Given the strong capacity of the virus to spread and the lack of preventive
measures, many countries have been systematically forced to lockdown the population temporarily. Although these policies may be useful in controlling the
spread of the virus in the immediate future, they are unsustainable over time
from an economic point of view. In this regard, forecasting the evolution and
consequences of the pandemic based on the exposure of the population becomes
a critical factor in decision-making [3, 4]. However, to rigorously predict these
effects, it is necessary to assess the current spread of the epidemic, which is
often unknown.
At the beginning of the XX century, the first mathematical models to study
the dynamics of an epidemic were introduced. Probably the most well-known
is the susceptible-infected-recovered model (SIR). SIR models and its variations
[5, 6] divide the population into compartments, and using differential (deterministic) equations, the number of individuals in each of the compartments over
time is estimated. Since then, many new variations of these models have been
introduced in the literature (see for review [7, 8, 9, 10] or more contemporary
examples [11, 12]).
However, those approaches suffer from a critical shortcoming. In essence,
they focus on explaining the dynamics of the epidemic at the population level
and exclude the complex interactions that occur at the microscopic level between
individuals [13, 14, 15]. Furthermore, these models tend to be adjusted with
fixed parameters that are not updated over time, according to how the epidemic
evolves and the different policies introduced.
In the current era of precision medicine, where more efficient solutions are
being sought that optimize the health of the individual [16], it is surprising not
to find in the current state of the art models of epidemic spread that follow more
individual approaches [17, 18], as is rightly pointed out in [19]. Precisely in [19],
the authors propose to adopt new models that exploit the enormous individual
information recorded by biosensors [20] and other devices.
A crucial aspect to consider in the success of mathematical modeling is the
need to adjust the parameters of the models with accurate data. However, this is
difficult to achieve in practice, because governments are often overloaded, and
information is only recorded on patients with symptoms. The observational
nature of this data [21], together with a delay or errors in the recording of
information [22], requires specific techniques to correct the biases related to the
data [23].

1.1

Main contributions and results

Motivated by the need to developed new models that overcome these drawbacks
and that estimate the expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 in a realistic way in Spain,

2

we introduce a new probabilistic model. The contributions and most significant
results of this paper are introduced below.
• To the best of our knowledge, we propose one of the few probabilistic
models that estimate the evolution of an epidemic from each individual
of the population. This model combines the finite Markov model, along
with continuous probability distributions and a dynamic Poisson model.
• The model is designed in such a way that it does not need to use statistics
on the number of infections that have a significant measurement error,
and uses mortality records instead.
• The model estimates for each day the number of susceptible, contaminated, recovered, and fatalities. For this, we solve an inverse problem,
and we introduce biological expert knowledge related to the SARS-CoV-2
disease into the probabilistic model about the time each individual spends
in the different states and the transition of probabilities.
• Using the data from several regions of Spain, we estimate the real number
of infections as of April 26st. The results show a higher proportion of
infections than that provided by the Spanish government.
• The effect of the Coronavirus has been uneven among regions of Spain.
In Madrid, more than 10 percent of the population was infected, or it
recovers from the virus, while in Galicia, this percentage is less than 2.5.
• These results highlight differences between regions; i) the degree of immunity of the population can be different; ii) the number of recovered people
who can return to normality is also different; iii) based on this analysis,
a reasonable strategy to be considered could be to lift the quarantine on
a case-by-case basis based on the degree of exposure of each region to the
virus.
• Finally, we repeat the estimations assuming that the number of fatalities
is twice than reported by the official records. In this case, the number of
infections can increases between 40 y 110 percent by region. However, we
must interpret these results with caution.

Outline

The mathematical details of the model are relegated to the end of the article,
to facilitate the readability for a general target audience. The structure of the
article is as follows: First, we describe the evolution of Coronavirus in Spain,
together with some demographic and economic characteristics of the Spanish
population. Subsequently, we fit our model in different scenarios, and we show
the evolution of susceptible patients, infected and recovered ones over time.
Next, we discuss the results and limitations of the model. Finally, we introduce
the mathematical content of our model and the computational details of the
implementation and parameter optimization.

COVID-19 in Spain

Spain was one of the first countries in the world to experience the effects of
COVID-19 after China and Italy. However, despite the delay in the start of
the outbreak, with respect to these countries, the consequences are now more
dramatic. To give a better context to the evolution of Coronavirus in Spain and
to compare it with other countries, we introduce some historical background:
• January 31st. The first positive result was confirmed on Spanish territory
in La Gomera. At that time, there were around 10, 000 confirmed cases
worldwide.
• February 12th. The Mobile World Congress, one of the most remarkable
technological congresses in the world to be held in Barcelona, was canceled.
• March 8th. Multitudinous marches were celebrated in Spain. Also, sports
competitions and other events were held as usual.
• March 13th. Madrid reported 500 new cases of Cov-19 in one day (64
deaths total). Wuhan had gone into lockdown with 400 new cases per day
(17 deaths total).
• March 14th. With the increase in the outbreak of infections, the government declared a quarantine throughout the country.
• March 21st. Due to an overloaded health system, the first patients started
to arrive at new makeshift hospitals.
• April 3rd. Spain accounts for a total of 117, 710 confirmed cases, surpassing Italy for the first time.
• April 6th. Spain becomes the country in the world with more deaths per
million inhabitants.
• April 9th. The FMI forecasts that 170 countries are going to be into
recession this year in the worst crisis since the Great Depression.
• April 18th. The Spanish government changes protocols for the daily statistics of COVID-19.
• April 21th. The president of the United States, Donald Trump, declared:
”It’s incredible what happened to Spain, it’s been shattered.”.
Figure 1, shows accumulated number of cases and deceases respectively in
the previous periods in Spain, Italy, China, United Kingdom and the United
States according to the data supplied by the different governments.
Following the statistics of the Population Reference Bureau, Spain is the
20th country with the world’s oldest population [26]. The country demographic
structure, poverty rates, and epidemiological profiles is essential to compare
mortality between countries. In the Coronavirus disease, relative and absolute
case-fatality risk (CFR) [27] increases dramatically with age and with comorbidity, as evidenced by the current literature. Relative risk can increase by more
than 900% in patients over 60 [28].

Table 1: Demographic and socioeconomics characteristics of the Spanish population throughout some regions: Galicia, Paı́s Vasco, Castilla y León, Cataluña,
Madrid [25].
Subsequently, we perform a descriptive analysis in the regions of Spain that
we analyze in this paper: Galicia, Paı́s Vasco, Castilla y León, Madrid, Cataluña.
Table 1 contains the essential demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of
these regions. We can see that Castilla y León is the region with the highest
proportion of elderly people. At the same time, Castilla y León has the most
delocalized population centers, and the Paı́s Vasco is the region with the lowest poverty rate. Spain is a multicultural country where there are significant
economic, geographical, social, and demographic differences throughout the regions. All these peculiarities make Spain an interesting country to extrapolate
the effects of the spread of the Coronavirus to other regions and countries.
Finally, in Figure 2, we show the evolution of infections and fatalities among
the regions under consideration. As we can see, Madrid is the most affected
region, while Galicia is the least affected, despite its older population. However,
it is important to note that the outbreak began later, and the containment was

Results

Next, we show the estimation performed with the model until April 26st in
Galicia, Paı́s Vasco, Castilla y León, Madrid, Cataluña, assuming that these
two scenarios hold:
1. We assume that the number of real deaths due to Coronavirus is the one
reflected by the official records.
2. We assume that many people have died of Coronavirus, but they have not
been included in the records because a diagnostic test was not performed.
In particular, we shall suppose that the number of deaths is twice as high
as those indicated in the official records each day.
We graphically represent along time the result of estimating how many individuals belong to each of the following states:
• I1 (t): Number of infected individuals who are incubating the virus on day
t.
• I2 (t): Number of infected people who have passed the incubation period
and do not show symptoms on day t.
• I3 (t): Number of infected people who have passed the incubation period
and do show symptoms on day t.
• R1 (t): Number of recovered cases which are still able to infect on day t.
• R2 (t). Number of recovered cases which are not able to infect anymore on
day t.
6

• M (t): Number of deaths on day t.
In addition, to understand the meaning of the results, we show: i) the number
of people who may be contaminated or who have already transmitted the virus
as a percentage of the population size; and ii) the rate of new infections each
day.
Finally, we introduce confidence bands of our estimations 1 .

Analysis of results

The most relevant results are described below:
• Madrid is the most affected the region by COVID-19. 19.5 % of the population could have been infected or recovered from the virus if we assume
that the number of deaths is double that reported by the Government. At
present, there may be 120, 000 patients recovered.
• Galicia is the region which suffered the mildest effects. The percentage of
infected people is less than 2.5 %.
• Castilla y León, Pais Vasco, Cataluña could have suffered the effects of
COVID-19 with a proportional magnitude. The percentage of infections
could be between 6 − 10 % of the population.
• The peak of new infections has probably occurred at the start of quarantine, while the peak of people who can contaminate took place between
March 17-24.
• The number of new infections have been dramatically reduced after the
introduction of containment measures. Now, it seems that the situation
is back under control.

Discussion

The Coronavirus pandemic is causing an unprecedented crisis in health, economic, and social terms throughout the world. To help designing better politicies in the future, estimating the number of people who were infected by the
virus is a crucial priority. To address this issue, we have proposed a new probabilistic model to estimate the spread of an epidemic by simulating the behaviour
of each individual in a population.

COVID-19 in Spain
The predictions obtained over several regions of Spain have practical relevance.
The results reveal that the number of infections is much higher than what is
reported by the Spanish government. Two factors may explain these discrepancies: i) The tests were carried out in a limited way among the general population;
and ii) no random sampling was done among the different regions throughout
the territory shading the real magnitude of the pandemic. It is also worth noting that its impact was uneven across regions. Madrid was the most affected
region, while Galicia was the least affected. However, according to our model,
in Cataluña, Castilla y León, and the Paı́s Vasco, the effects were surprisingly
similar, even though the outbreak of infections theoretically started at different
time points. In addition, the geographical dispersion of Castilla y León is more
significant (see Table 1). Perhaps the older population of Castilla y León (see
Table 1) has a higher case fatality rate than the other communities, and our
model is overestimating the number of infected people in that region. As previously mentioned, taking into account the demographic structure of the regions,
together with the epidemiological profiles and other socioeconomic characteristics, is fundamental in the analysis of results.
More deaths than those reported in the official records
Even though many patients die due to the virus, this is not the official cause
of death. This problem occurs due to a lack of diagnostic tests. Spanish and
International press echoed this problem in the current Coronavirus crisis, and
more than twice as many deaths than those officially announced have been
reported in certain regions. A recent study reported that the actual number of
deaths might be even three times higher in Italy [29].
Due to this fact, it is vital to take into account this uncertainty present in
the models to perform an accurate estimate of the number of actual infections.
However, this uncertainty is not probabilistic. To alleviate this problem, we
have assumed that there could be up to twice the number of official deaths.
If we consider this correction, the number of infected increases from 40 to
110 percent by region.
Practical considerations of this results
These findings allow us have a better sense of the degree of exposure to the
virus of the population and to design a restoration to normality based on the
following factors.
• The degree of immunity of each population.
21

• The number of people who might contaminate today.
• The number of recovered patients.
In this sense, it is vital to gradually de-escalate the confinement and always
proceed according to the individual characteristics of each region.
For the moment, there is no available vaccine for use with humans, and there
is uncertainty about treatments. Therefore it is advisable to take measures such
as social distancing [30] to prevent the infection rate from skyrocketing and to
avoid another outbreak.
The notorious peak
Wondering about when the peak of infection would have been reached was a
hot topic in mass media. However, such peak can be i) the maximum peak of
new infections. ii) the maximum peak of people who can contaminate. In the
first case, our models prove the existence of this peak between 9 − 16 March,
while in the second case, it was estimated to be in March 17 − 24.
From a perspective of virus containment, the most important is the second
one from as it indicates the number of potential transmitters.

Methodological aspects of epidemic modeling
From a methodological standpoint, indeed, there are already simulators that
work at the individual level [31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. However, from our point of view,
the models analyzed have some of the following potential limitations: i) some
models use fixed parameters without prior optimization according to the target
population; ii) the parameters do not usually evolve dynamically according to
the policies introduced; and iii), many of these models were designed without
adding biological expert knowledge.
More generally we can find two philosophies when addressing epidemic forecasting in the literature (see [18]): i) Mechanistic models: Using an epidemiological approach, these models explain the evolution of an epidemic from the
causal mechanisms of transmissionc [13]; ii) Phenomenological models: From
entirely data-driven approaches such as regression models or time series, the
development of epidemics is predicted using historical data [18].
Phenomenological models can be an appropriate solution in the case of epidemics such as influenza [36], for which there exists long-term data collected on
hospitalization and mortality rates. Additionally, the etiology, together with the
previous incidence rates, are better characterized. With all this, extrapolations
of the real impact of the epidemic in the whole population can be done from
data-driven approaches. In addition, current evidence indicates that influenza
incubation times are shorter than those of COVID-19, which reduces an individual’s potential exposure to the virus. For all these reasons, we believe that
in the case of the new COVID-19, it is necessary to use Mechanistic models as
our proposal.
Often, defining a clear boundary between Mechanistic models and Phenomenological models may not be simple, and even both methods can be seen as
complementary approaches. For example, SIR models and their variants from
a theoretical point of view try to explain the effects of an epidemic from the
mechanisms of transmission, however they are often used as time series [37].
22

At this point, we would like to point out that the underpinning assumptions
of these models are often unrealistic [5]. Moreover, from the perspective of
Epistemology and Epidemiology, the epidemic spread is based on the complex
interactions between individuals, which these models cannot capture due to
their population-based nature [18].
The use of individual models should be an aspiration in the development of
new methods. In the current era of big data, in developed countries, a substantial part of the population is geolocalized through mobile devices. Moreover,
it is increasingly common to use biosensors that monitor patient health [20].
Knowledge about interactions between individuals and patient health can provide a more realistic picture of the spread and evolution of the epidemic [38].
However, in this context, it is necessary to systematically apply techniques that
correct the biases that appear in the observational nature of these data. At the
same time, it is also important to preserve the privacy of the citizens.
The absence of reliable information is one of the main problems with the
COVID-19 pandemic. To alleviate this problem, when fitting model parameters, it is important to understand the social, economic, and demographic
characteristics along with the epidemiological profiles of the region to introduce
expert knowledge into the model and reduce uncertainty in statistical learning.
Also, with this strategy, we reduce the computational demands and we increase
model interpretability.

Collaborative attitude
Information is one of the most valuable weapons in combating a pandemic of
this magnitude. Understanding the mechanisms of virus transmission [39, 40],
the prevalence of asymptomatic patients in the population [41], risk and prognostic factors [22] are topics that can reduce the number of deaths. Due to the
absence of prior knowledge of all these factors, a collaborative approach between
countries and institutions to share their knowledge should be a top priority.
At an international level, we could highlight the initiative promoted by Eran
Segal from Israel, to which several countries have joined [42]. Segal and his team
designed a survey in which anonymous volunteers participated to estimate the
real evolution of the Coronavirus in Israel [43]. This questionnaire was adapted
and applied in other countries. There is now an international consortium in
action to share the results of these surveys, together with other clinical information from patients. However, it is important to note that the data obtained
from the questionnaires do not represent a random sample of the population,
which limits the quality of the data collected.

Expert knowledge in parameter fitting
From a general perspective of inverse problems and statistical learning, the
estimation of the model parameters is an ill-posed problem [44, 45, 46, 47, 48,
49]. In the case of epidemic spread models, these difficulties are even more
significant (see, for example, [50, 51]). In practice, the evolution of several
compartments is predicted simultaneously, and usually, there is only information
about the actual growth of one of the compartments.
In this regard, it is vital to follow Ockham’s Razor rule: the simplest solution
is most likely the right. Reducing the number of variables to be fitted in the
23

models and introducing expert knowledge into these models guided by current
biological evidence is for ill-posed estimation problems.
In the case of COVID-19, the current epidemiological evidence is inconsistent. It is especially noteworthy about the case fatality rate (CFR) and the
proportion of asymptomatic patients [52]. In the first case, variations between
0.4 and 15 percent have been reported in the literature. Meanwhile, with asymptomatic patients, these range from 20 percent to 80 percent. The primary rationale for these discrepancies is the application of non-observational data analysis
methods for a sample composed largely of elderly patients. In this sense, after
carrying out our estimates taking into account the demographic structure of
Spain and using the published articles that we believe reflect the reality in a
more precise way, we estimate that the rate of asymptomatic patients ranges between 75 and 85 percent. Likewise, CFR may vary between 0.4 and 0.8 percent.
A recent article has estimated that asymptomatic patients to be 78 percent [53].

Combining a probabilistic model with a deterministic inverse problem
Our probabilistic model is non-stationary and has a complex dependency structure. In addition, the time series of each day’s death records can be seen as a
realization of the stochastic process.
To fit the model, we estimate a deterministic inverse problem that makes the
observed deaths is the average of the random process. From there, we define a
window, and we try with a non-probabilistic approach to capture the trajectories
of fatalities close to the real one. In this way, we can obtain trajectories of the
random process that allow us to explain the real situation of the infected in
each region. In other words: From day one, with the chosen configuration of
parameters, we can have many different scenarios in our probabilistic model;
however, at the present moment, we already observed a concrete trajectory.
Then, using this trajectory as a reference, we look for a set of close trajectories
that measure other alternative scenarios that approximate the real number of
deaths.

Model limitations
The main limitation of our proposal is that some of the parameters on which the
model depends on are set and may need to be tuned more carefully to the study
population. However, the current biological evidence does not allow further
refinement. Also, optimizing more parameters with a data-driven approach is
dangerous due to the quality of data about infections reported by governments.
Therefore, it is better to restrict oneself to current biological expertise information.
The models are an approximation of reality, and as Cox would say: all models
are wrong, some are useful. We are predicting the unknown in this epidemic
without reliable data. However, with statistical simulation models [54, 55], we
can see the effect of a deviation of the input parameters, the extreme cases, and
the model predictions in other scenarios such as the end of containment policies.
Another limitation of our model is that despite simulating data for each individual in the population, we were not using information about the demographic

24

structure and epidemiological profile along regions. We also not introduce geolocation information as in the interaction between each individual in the population [38]. However, the inclusion of all these aspects, may not lead to greater
accuracy as no reliable model output data are available, and, furthermore, we
would be entering into privacy issues that are beyond the scope of this study.

Future work and model extensions
Our immediate work is to extend our estimations to other countries. Also, we
want to simulate the effect of an immediate end coronavirus lockdown [56] in
each of these location. We also want to carry out simulations to find out how
to minimize the effects of a possible outbreak in Autumn [4], for example, with
social distance [57] or weeks of partitioned work: combining remote working
with face-to-face activity. In a complementary way, it would be interesting to
predict the effects of these measures on the economy. Some economists claim
that the economic consequences of this crisis may be more damaging to our
health in the long term than the effects caused directly by the virus [58].
From a methodological point of view, another exciting extension is to develop a mixed model or an empirical Bayes framework (see an example of this
methodology [59]) to make a simultaneous estimation across many regions and
to be able to make a statistical inference about the parameters of the models.
In this case, it may be interesting to optimize the parameters with Bayesian
optimization [60], to alleviate the computational issues of this approach. Another variation of the model may be to employ other probability distributions
such as the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution [61] to handle underdispersion situations in the number of newly infected. However, our current election
of Poisson distribution is well motivated given the asymptotic properties of the
Erdos-Rényi model [62].
Finally, another possible improvement of the model could be to introduce an
ensemble forecasting as they do in meteorology and manage better the possible
uncertainty in the initial conditions [63].

Our future prediction in the world
Given the current emergency, and the need to provide predictions on the spread
of the epidemic worldwide, we have decided to set up a website (https://
github.com/covid19-modeling/forecasts) where we regularly update our
estimates across many regions of the world in a fully accessible manner. In
addition to this, we will be incorporating our simulations of what the effect of
current end coronavirus lockdown would be in each of these regions.

Mathematical model

5.1

Model elements

We suppose that D = {0, 1, · · · , n} is the set of days under study. Consider the
following random processes whose domain is defined on D.
• S(t): Number of people susceptible to become infected on day t.
• I1 (t): Number of infected individuals who are incubating the virus on day
t.
• I2 (t): Number of infected people who have passed the incubation period
and do not show symptoms on day t.
• I3 (t): Number of infected people who have passed the incubation period
and do show symptoms on day t.
• R1 (t): Number of recovered cases which are still able to infect on day t.
• R2 (t). Number of recovered cases which are not able to infect anymore on
day t.
• M (t): Number of deaths on day t.
Henceforth, we will denote by I(t) = I1 (t) + I2 (t) + I3 (t) the number of
infected people at time t ∈ D and R(t) = R1 (t) + R2 (t) the number of recovered
people.
The above random processes describe the evolution of population in different compartments. However, unlike the classics models [6, 10], we divided the
infected and recovered individuals in a more broader and realistic taxonomy
for the particular case of the COVID-19. There are two main reasons for this:
First, the patients tested by healthcare are usually those found in I3 . In this
case, there exists a corpus of prior knowledge about how they evolve over time
and in case of death, which is their survival time. Second, there is evidence that
there are recovered patients who can still infect others.

5.2

Model definition

The causal mechanism of new infected individuals (see Figure 13) is introduced
below. For each day t ∈ D, we assume that the new infected population I1 (t) −
I1 (t−1), is generated by the individual interaction of the susceptible people with
infected patients and the recovered cases who can still contaminate. Formally,
we assume that if a person can contaminate, it does so according to a random
variable X ∼ Poisson(Ri (t)), being Ri (t) the average number of new infections
that can cause each person in the day t. It is important to remark, that it
is natural to assume that the function Ri (t) follows a decreasing trend over
time in our setting, basically for two reasons: i) quarantine policies have been
systematically introduced along with different countries and regions. ii) the
number of susceptible people decreases over time, while the number of infected
people can increase. This all makes it more complicated to interact with a
non-infected people.

Figure 13: Diagram of state changes in our model.
Once a new infected person arrives to the model (see Figure 13), we assume
that the transitions between the different graph states are modeled by a probability law that verifies the following conditions: i) the transition probabilities are
independent of the absolute instant when such transition takes place ii) the probabilities depend only on the current state of the patient regardless of the previous path in the graph. In particular, given the States = {I1 , I2 , I3 , R1 , R2 , M },
and α, β ∈ [0, 1], we have: P(I2 |I1 ) = α, P(I3 |I1 ) = 1 − α, P(M |I3 ) = β,
P(R1 |I3 ) = 1 − β, P(I3 |I2 ) = 1, P(R2 |R1 ) = 1; all other transitions take a value
equal to zero in probability. More schematically, the transition matrix between
events is shown in the Equation 1.

Model implementation

The proposed model is not known to have an closed-form solution. In a realworld setting, it is necessary to use statistical simulation methods to approximate the mean trajectory or quantile functions over time. Also, we must fit
some parameters of the model to characterize the behavior of the study population. For this purpose, we use a sample of the deceased patients M1 , M2 ,· · · ,
Ms of each day in the timeframe O = {1, · · · , s}.
Next, we suppose that our model (M ) is dependent on a vector of parameters θ = (θ1 , θ2 ) ∈ Rp1 × Rp2 (with p1 + p2 = p), where θ1 is a vector
of dimension p1 , defined in beforehand, and θ2 must be estimated from the
sample. Furthermore, let us assume that the initial state of the system is
characterized by S = (S(0), I1 (0), I2 (0), I3 (0), R1 (0), R2 (0), M (0)) ∈ N7 and
T = (T1 (0), T2 (0), T3 (0), T4 (0), T5 (0), T6 (0)) ∈ Nm × · · · × Nm . S has the number of elements for each compartment of the model on day 0. T also contains
the amount of remaining days to complete the transition they are in for each
individual in the initial state, being m a integer number that represents the
maximun numbers of registred days.
To simplify the notation, from now on we denote the average dead trajectory
by the function M ean(θ1 , θ2 , S, T )(t) for each day t ∈ D
The next step is to estimate θ̂2 . To do this, we solve the following optimization problem:
θ̂2 = arg

estimation. Examples
of this weights may

Psbe:
ω i = Mi / i=1 Mi or ω i = (1/Mi )/( i=1 1/Mi ) (i = 1, . . . , s).
At this point, it is relevant to note that the above optimization problem (2),
as formulated, includes the possibility of introducing constraints in the space of
parameters. It is important because we have prior knowledge of what the range
of the parameters is. We may know constraints involving them as well.
In Equation (2), we have used the real mean trajectory. However, in practice,
this is unknown, and we must approximate it using simulation.
PB Next, we run B
differents simulations and we denote by M (θ1 , θ20 , S, T ) = B1 i=1 M i (θ1 , θ2 , S, T ),
the estimated mean trajectory. M i (θ, θ2 , S, T ) (i = 1, · · · , B) denote the result
of each simulation.
So the optimization problem to be solved is:

where a ∈ [0, 3], b ∈ [−1, 1], c ∈ [0, 1], d ∈ [0, 1], e ∈ [0, 1], f ∈ [0, 1] with
θ2 = (a, b, c, d, e, f ) ∈ [0, 3] × [−1, 1] × [0, 1] × [0, 1] × [0, 1] × [0, 1] and C is a
positive constant fixed 0.005.

5.4

Model optimization

In our setting, we have found optimal parameters taking into account randomness in the approximation of the mean. To do this, we must resort to stochastic
optimization algorithms.
Many algorithms of this kind can be found in literature, but based on
the good results obtained in a preeliminary analysis we have decided to use
a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm: the CMA-ES [79]. CMA-ES is an
evolutionary-based derivative-free optimization technique that can optimize a
wide variety of functions, including noisy functions as the one we use in our
method. One survey of Black-Box optimizations found it outranked 31 other
optimization algorithms, performing especially keen on “difficult functions” or
larger dimensional search spaces [80]. From a theoretical point of view, CMA-ES
can be seen as a particular case of Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM)
[81].

5.5

Model Inference

Our model has been fitted independently for each region. Therefore, we cannot
make statistical inference in the usual sense since we only observe a trajectory
of a stochastic process with a complex dependence structure. Hence, to identify
the model, we assume that the observed trajectory of accumulated deaths is the
mean of our random process.

29

Given a day t0 ∈ O, Mt0 accumulated number of observed deaths in t0 and
the multivariate random process
{X(t) = (I1 (t), I2 (t), I3 (t), R1 (t), R2 (t), M (t))}t∈D , the death trajectories of the
probabilistic model close to the observed path on t0 , are for us a set of possible
explanations of the spread of the coronavirus in a study region. We now formalize this idea. Let Iα = [Mt0 − αMt0 , Mt0 + αMt0 ], where α ∈ (0, 1). Considerer,
{ω ∈ Ω : M (t0 , ω) ∈ Iα }, being Ω sample space of process {X(t)}t∈D . We build
our confidence bands of level α as paths that belong {ω ∈ Ω : M (t0 , ω) ∈ Iα }.
Our confidence bands contain the trajectories of infected and recovered patients that generate many deaths similar to that which occurs in reality. Therefore, in practice, α = 0.1 is usually a fair value, and t0 is selected as one of the
latest datums in the historical records.

5.6

Software details and resources

Our proposal has been implemented in several programming languages: C++,
Python, and R, although the results shown in this article have been obtained
with Python. We optimized the parameters using library pycma [82], and Numpy
has been used for mathematical operations.
In the different statistical analyses performed, we have used R. Plots have
been made both in R with ggplot2 library and in Python with Matplotlib.
Finally, the training data used to fit the models can be downloaded from at
[83] and [84].
In the immediate future we are going to release the code used in this paper for
the benefit of the scientific community at (https://github.com/covid19-modeling).
