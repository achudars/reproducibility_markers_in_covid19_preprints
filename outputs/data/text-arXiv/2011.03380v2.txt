A central feature of an emerging infectious disease in a pandemic scenario is the spread through
geographical scales and the impacts on different locations according to the adopted mitigation protocols. We investigated a stochastic epidemic model with the metapopulation approach in which
patches represent municipalities. Contagion follows a stochastic compartmental model for municipalities; the latter, in turn, interact with each other through recurrent mobility. As a case of study,
we consider the epidemic of COVID-19 in Brazil performing data-driven simulations. Properties of
the simulated epidemic curves have very broad distributions across different geographical locations
and scales, from states, passing through intermediate and immediate regions down to municipality
levels. Correlations between delay of the epidemic outbreak and distance from the respective capital
cities were predicted to be strong in several states and weak in others, signaling influences of multiple
epidemic foci propagating towards the inland cities. Responses of different regions to a same mitigation protocol can vary enormously implying that the policies of combating the epidemics must
be engineered according to the region’ specificity but integrated with the overall situation. Real
series of reported cases confirm the qualitative scenarios predicted in simulations. Even though
we restricted our study to Brazil, the prospects and model can be extended to other geographical
organizations with heterogeneous demographic distributions.

INTRODUCTION

Theoretical and computational toolboxes used and
developed by physicists over decades and, in particular, those of equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical
physics have found an inexhaustible source of applications in complexity [1–4] attaining an apex with the raising of network science at late 1990s [5]. Epidemic models,
which are intimately related with nonequilibrium phase
transitions [6], running on the top of networks soon became one of the most imminent fields of interdisciplinary
physics [7–9] with many applications on real epidemic
scenarios lead by physicists [10–12]. The pandemic of
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been marked by
a wide discussion heavily grounded on data-driven epidemic modeling, again with outstanding contributions
lead by physicists [13–16].
Since COVID-19 outbreak was reported in Wuhan,
Hubei province, China, at the end of December 2019,
the scientific community has turned its attention to understanding and combating this novel threat [13, 14, 17–
19]. A characteristic of this infectious disease, caused
by the pathogen coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is the high
transmission rate of individuals without significant symptoms [19, 20] who traveled unrestrictedly and spread
COVID-19 through all continents except Antarctica. Efforts to track the transmission from Wuhan to the rest of
mainland China and world relied on mathematical modeling [13, 14, 18, 21, 22], which were soon extended to
other countries [23–25], using the metapopulation approach [26–28]. In this modeling, the population is
grouped in patches representing geographic regions and
the epidemic contagion obeys standard compartmental
models [29] within the patches, while mobility among
them promotes the epidemic to spread through the whole
population. Metapopulation approaches, which were ini-

tially conceived in ecology contexts [30], have been used
for many epidemic processes [26–28, 31–34] and allow a
geographical resolution absent in standard compartmental models [29]. One remarkable feature of the metapopulation approach is its capability to integrate the epidemic
modeling in different regions into a single framework, in
which correlation between epidemic waves in different regions can be investigated.
We are interested on the geographical variability and
impacts of an emerging and highly contagious infections
disease such as the COVID-19 in continental scales and
we chose the recent pandemics in Brazil as a case of
study. Brazil is a country of continental territory with
an area of 8.5 × 106 km2 demographically, economically,
and developmentally very heterogeneous. It is a federation divided into 26 states and one Federal District, its
capital city. States are divided into municipalities; each
state has its own capital city. The total number of municipalities is 5570 and, according to estimates of 2019,
the country population is approximately 210 million [35].
Striking characteristics of the Brazilian demography are
the broad distributions of the rural and urban population fractions and urban population densities of municipalities, which are important traits in epidemic modeling [36, 37]. Therefore, investigation of a pandemic and
its consequences have necessarily to integrate the particularities of each region, which can be reckoned with the
metapopulation approach.
In this work, we investigate a metapopulation model
and applied it to the COVID-19 epidemic spread in the
Brazilian municipalities. At the time of submission, early
June 2020, the benchmark of 800 000 cases and 40 000
deaths was surpassed in Brazil, which became in this date
the country with highest epidemic incidence and possibly a new worldwide epicenter of COVID-19 [38]. At
time of resubmission, mid October 2020, the number of

2
cases had surpassed 5.5 millions with more than 150 000
deaths. The model is supplied by demographic and mobility data mined from public sources, which are used in
the stochastic simulations. We quantify how diversified
the epidemic can be across the country rather than try
to accurately foresee outbreaks in specific locations. We
determine the level of dispersion in the curves of the epidemic prevalence in different places within a hypothetical
scenario of uniform mitigation measures. We take the situation of 31 March 2020 as the initial condition, with foci
in 410 municipalities, allowing to track the epidemics in
all municipalities in a single integrated simulation. We
predicted that the prevalence curves can vary enormously
over geographical scales ranging from states down to municipalities. We also predicted that some states are characterized by outbreaks starting mainly in their capital
cities, followed by epidemic waves propagating toward
the countryside, while in other states there are multiple
epidemic foci. Our results explain why policies of combating a countrywide pandemic should be simultaneously
decentralized, in the sense that each locality has to consider its specificities, and integrated, since the fate of one
region depends on the attitudes adopted by others. These
qualitative behaviors have been confirmed a posteriori.
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. The
model is described in Sec. II while its computer implementation and parameters are in Appendixes A and B,
respectively. Model calibration using nowcasting is presented in Sec. III while the detailed results are in Sec. IV.
Some discussions and remarks are presented in Sec. V.
In Sec. VI, we present a brief afterwords commenting
the achievements of the model in forecasting the qualitative countrywide behavior of the pandemics in Brazil
five months after the predictions were made [39].

A.

THE MODEL
Metapopulation

We consider a stochastic metapopulation model for the
countrywide spread of the epidemic, in which a key ingredient is recurrent mobility [28] whereby individuals
travel to other patches but return to their residence recurrently. The population is divided into patches which
represent the places of residence as schematically shown
in Fig. 1a). Similar models have been used for modeling
of COVID-19 in Spain [16, 24, 25]. In particular, our
model is inspired on a recent work [24] to investigate the
COVID-19. We use a different, continuous-time approach
where geographical, demographical, and testing capacity
specificities are included. As in general metapopulation
models, a patch can represent a municipality, a neighborhood or any other demographic distribution of interest.
Each patch is labeled by i = 1, 2, . . . , Ω, where Ω is the
number of patches, and has a resident population fixed in
time given by Ni . The inter-patch mobility rate is given
by Wij defined as the number of individuals that travel

Patches i and j of different population sizes (represented by
the areas) can interchange individuals with rates Wij and Wji .
The epidemic events occur within patches under the hypothesis of well-mixed populations as illustrated in the zoom of
patch l. Six compartments are used: susceptible (S), exposed
(E), asymptomatic or presymptomatic (A), unconfirmed (U),
confirmed (C), and removed (R). The infection rate per contact λX can be of three forms, depending on the infectious
contacts: S and A (λA ), S and U (λU ), and S and C (λC ).

from i to j and return to i after a typical time Tr . A
patch j for which Wij > 0 is a neighbor of i. Different
forms of mobility, with their corresponding characteristic times, can be implemented. For the sake of simplicity,
recurrent flux of individuals per day (Tr = 1 d) is used
in the present work. Mobility within patches is not explicitly considered. Instead, we assume the well-mixed
population hypothesis [29] where an individual has equal
chance to be in contact with any other in the same patch.

B.

Demography and contacts

The average number of contacts per individual of patch
i per unit of time is ki . Variations in the social distancing
can be implemented by altering ki . Contacts are related
to local mobility and are strongly correlated with the
population density ξi . Monotonic increase has been proposed [36]. We follow Ref. [24] and use a contact number
modulated by ki ∝ f (ξi ) with f (ξ) = 2 − exp(−aξ). To
take into account the sparse demographic distribution of
Brazil, we used the urban population density of each municipality to compute ξi . Interactions between urban and
rural populations are also explicitly considered through
a symmetric 2 × 2 contact matrix Cuu , Crr , and Cur = Cru ,
0 ≤ Cxy ≤ 1, determining the contacts between urban (u)
and rural (r) populations whose fractions are represented
by ωi and 1 − ωi , respectively. The number of contacts
in patch i is also modulated by
ki ∝ gi = Cuu ωi2 + 2ωi (1 − ωi )Cur + (1 − ωi )2 Crr ,

where the terms represent urban-urban, urban-rural, and
rural-rural interactions from left to right. The contacts

are parameterized by their average number per individual
hki, such that ki = zgi f (ξi )hki, where

Epidemic model

The epidemic dynamics within the patches considers
three noncontagious compartments which are: susceptible (S), that can be infected; removed (R), that represents immunized or deceased individuals; and exposed
(E) that carries the virus but does not transmit it. Compartments of contagious individuals are: asymptomatic
(A), that have not presented symptoms; unconfirmed
(U), which are symptomatic but not yet identified by
tests; and confirmed (C), that have tested positive for
COVID-19. The compartment A is actually a simplification of the real situation. At least two relevant types
of asymptomatic persons do exist: presymptomatic, that
will develop symptoms at the end of the incubation period, and the truly asymptomatic, that becomes recovered without any significant symptoms. There exist large
uncertainties with respect to the fraction of individuals who are truly asymptomatic [40, 41]. According to
the parameters used in this work (see Appendix B), we
have approximated 30% of truly asymptomatic in compartment A which lies within the interval reported elsewhere [40]. Due to the uncertainty of the available data,
we also assume a same contagion rate for both types of
asymptomatic individuals which are hereafter treated as
a single compartment. The epidemic transitions obey
a SEAUCR model, in which susceptible individuals become exposed by contact with contagious persons (A,
U, or C) with rates λA , λU , and λC , respectively. Exposed individuals spontaneously become asymptomatic
with rate µA , while the latter transitions to unconfirmed
(presymptomatic), confirmed, or removed (truly asymptomatic) states happen with rates βC , βU , and βR , respectively. Finally, unconfirmed or confirmed individuals
are removed from the epidemic process (via recovery or
death) with rate αR . The transition U→C has rate αC

The transition E→U was not included since most studies
agree that the asymptomatic or presymptomatic condi-

tion is a central characteristic of COVID-19 [19, 40–42].
The contact of confirmed individuals is reduced to bki
with b < 1. Figure 1b) shows a schematic representation
of the epidemic events.
Individuals residing in i can move to neighbors j following a stochastic process with rates Ri /Tr where Ri
is the population fraction of i that moves recurrently;
the destination j is chosen proportionally to Wij . Symptomatic (U or C) individuals do not leave their residence
patches but if the transitions to U or C happen out of
his/her residence they return with rate 1/Tr , as do the
individuals in other epidemic states. Infection, healing
and other transitions follow Poisson processes with the
corresponding rates. Details of the computer implementation, using an optimized Gillespie algorithm [43], are
given in the Appendix A.
D.

Initial condition

The initial condition is a major hurdle for the accurate forecasting of a pandemic due to high underscore
and delays in reporting. First studies of the COVID19 Wuhan outbreak estimated that undocumented infections were the source of at least 79% of documented
cases [19]. This number can be larger depending on the
testing policies [44, 45]. The investigated scenario was
the beginning of the pandemics in Brazil when testing
policies and data availability at municipality level were
still very premature. We assume a simple linear correlation between the increase in the number of confirmed
cases of COVID-19 reported by the official authorities
and infected cases (E, A, and U) in each municipality.
We used 31 March 2020 as the initial condition. Let
ñconf
(t) and ñrem
(t) be the number of confirmed and rei
i
moved (recovered plus deceased) cases of COVID-19 in
each municipality i [38] of Brazil at day t. Let t−1 correspond to 24 March, t0 to 31 March, and t1 to 4 April
2020. These data are provided in supplementary material
(SM) [46]. The initial condition at t0 is

local transmission, is a way to reduce the effects of underreporting. The prefactors were chosen together with

scenario. The last one is consistent with the estimates of
the Google Community Mobility Reports for Brazil within
this time window [47]; see Figs. 2 and 3.

E.

Mitigation strategies

Different mitigation strategies are studied by uniformly
reducing the inter-patch mobility and contact by factors (M, K), i.e., Wij → (1 − M )Wij , for j 6= i, and
ki → (1 − K)ki . We investigate three different scenarios: none, weak, and moderate mitigations represented
by (M, K) = (0, 0), (0.4, 0.3), and (0.8, 0.5), respectively.
We do not tackle the regime of suppression or strong mitigation that could drop the epidemic drastically. Averages
were evaluated over 10 independent simulations.

F.

Remarks on parameter choices

The extensive set of parameters is aimed to reproduce
the essence of the epidemic spreading at a countrywide
level but not to track accurately the epidemic outbreak
in every state or municipality. We specially assume uniform and constant control parameters for reduction of
inter-municipality movement and contacts as well as the
testing rates. This is surely not the real case. Each federative state or municipality has its own mitigation and
testing policies that are very heterogeneous. So, assuming uniformity and fitting the overall data at a country
level, it is possible to infer in which regions the epidemic
is evolving faster or slower than the average. Finally, our
initial condition is a guess driven by data but still limited.
The level of underreporting is known to be high, and
broad ranges of values have been reported [19, 44, 45].
The description of the complete set of epidemiological
parameters, the initial conditions, mobility and demographic data are given in Appendix B.

NOWCASTING AND MODEL
CALIBRATION

Irrespective of the heterogeneous testing approaches
among states [38], we assume that essentially all municipalities had capacity to detect COVID-19 in the first
hospitalized patients and, therefore, the number of municipalities with positive cases is expected to be an observable much less prone to the effects of underreporting
than the number of confirmed cases at the beginning of
the pandemics in Brazil. Figure 3 compares the evolution
of municipalities with confirmed cases between 1 and 22
April 2020 obtained in simulations with different mitigation measures and real data for each Brazilian state and
also for the whole country. Weak mitigation provides the
best agreement with the reported data whereas deviations start to appear after three weeks. The weak mitigation parameters (M, K) = (0.4, 0.3), which fit better
the overall data for Brazil, also perform well for most of
the states in this time window and especially those with
higher incidence of COVID-19 in the period, which lead
the averages over the country. However, some states (AC,
AM, PA, PE, PI, and RR - abbreviations for Brazilian
federative states are given in Fig. 3) were more consistent with the simulations without mitigation while others
(PB, PR, and RN) were nearer to a moderate mitigation.
No tuning with respect to specific places was used and,
consequently, it does not reproduce accurately the number of reported cases for all federative states due to the
diversified testing and social distancing policies across
different states and municipalities, in contrast with the
uniformity hypothesis of the present study.

IV.

GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS OF
EPIDEMIC PREVALENCE

The role of inter-municipality traffic is investigated reducing the contacts by 30% and varying the mobility.
The total number of cases changes very little since the
leading contribution comes from local transmission in
municipalities with larger incidence while the number of
municipalities with confirmed cases, shown in Fig. 2b),
depends significantly on the inter-municipality traffic restrictions. These results confirm the epidemiological concept that reducing long-distance travelling contributes
to delaying the outbreak onset in different places, but
alters little the countrywide epidemic prevalence [48],
as discussed in the context of COVID-19 spreading in
China [13, 49] and Spain [25], for example.
From now on, generic predictions under the aforementioned hypothetical scenarios are discussed. We stress
that these predictions, whose time window spans after
the resubmission time, were simulated in April 2020 [39].
High variability of the epidemic outbreaks (intensity, duration and delays) can be observed through all geographical scales. Diversity was found in other metapopulation
approaches for epidemic processes [23, 27] but the multi-

FIG. 3. Simulations and observations of the number of municipalities with confirmed cases of COVID-19 for the 26 federative
states of Brazil in the first three weeks of simulations. Data for the whole country are shown in the bottom right corner.
Simulations were performed using none, weak, and moderate mitigations with parameters (M, K) = (0, 0), (0.4, 0.3), and
(0.8, 0.5), respectively.

scale dispersion in our simulations is remarkable. At the
state level, the time when the outbreak reaches its maximum epidemic prevalence, the epidemic peak, varies considerably as shown in Figs. 4a) and 4b), where the epidemic prevalences for all states are shown as function of
time for a weak mitigation.
Let T and ρ be the time and prevalence of the epidemic peak, considering both unconfirmed and confirmed
individuals. According to the simulations with weak
mitigation, the first state to reach the peak would be
CE (TCE ≈ 34 d), followed closely by SP and AM
(TSP ≈ TAM ≈ 36 d). The respective prevalences would
be ρCE ≈ 3.6%, ρSP ≈ 4.9%, and ρAM ≈ 5.0%. The
state with highest epidemic prevalence would be RJ with
ρRJ ≈ 7.0% at TRJ ≈ 40 d. The epidemic peak would
happen later (TMA = 71 d), with maximum less intense
(ρMA ≈ 2.3%) and the curve broader for the MA state.
The MA case is particularly interesting because whereas
the peak for the state would happen last, for its capital
city São Luis it would occurs at day 41 slightly earlier
than the average peak for Brazil, which would be at day
44 in this scenario. These numbers should not be quantitatively compared with the real reported cases. Firstly,
the confirmed cases correspond to a small fraction of the
total of cases that depends on testing rate, an unknown
variable in our study, and curves for ρC are much broader
and have the peak postponed to later times. Secondly,
the uniform and constant mitigation and testing scenarios do not correspond to reality.
A spatially more refined analysis is done comparing im-

mediate and intermediate geographical regions of a same
federative state, which are determined by the Instituto
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatı́stica (IBGE) [50]. An immediate region is a structure of nearby urban areas with
intense interchange for immediate needs such as purchasing of goods, search for work, health care, and education.
An intermediate region agglomerates immediate regions
preferentially with the inclusion of large metropolitan areas [50] laying thus between immediate regions and federative states. In Brazil there are 133 intermediate and
510 immediate regions. Municipalities in different federative states do not belong to the same immediate regions
even if they have strong ties. The broad variability of
epidemic outbreaks observed at the federative state level
is repeated at higher resolutions of geographical aggregation. Figures 4c) to i) show the multi-scale structure
of the outbreaks within the state of MG. They compare the epidemic prevalences of different intermediate
regions, followed by the next scale with all immediate
regions belonging to the pair of intermediate ones presenting the epidemic peak first and last in Figs. 4d) and
e). Finally, the highest resolution with curves for municipalities within the respective immediate regions with the
earliest and latest maxima are shown in Figs. 4f) to i).
A large dispersion through the 13 intermediate regions
of the MG state is seen in Fig. 4c). The times and prevalence values at the peak differ by factors 2 and 6, respectively, between the regions that attain the maximum first
and last. Curves for all intermediate regions of the 26
federative states are shown in Figs. S1, S2, and S3 of the

Figs. S8 and S9 of the SM [46]. One can see that federative states with smaller territorial areas, such as SE, RN,
and RJ, tend to have smaller dispersions of the peak time
while those with larger and more sparsely connected territories, as AM, MT, and MS, have larger dispersions and
outliers. We also have states with larger but better connected territories such as SP, PR, and RS, for which the
dispersion is significant but not characterized by outliers.
Irrespective of the more cohesive outbreak patterns, the

7
epidemic peaks in immediate regions of the SP state, for
example, could take more than twice as long as the peak
at the capital city. Conversely, the outbreaks in the RJ
state would be less desynchronized than in its neighbors,
MG and SP, with the latest immediate region reaching
the epidemic peak only 50% later than the capital city
Rio de Janeiro, in this scenario.
The space-time progression of the epidemic presents
complex patterns as shown in Figure 6a) to g), where
color maps with the prevalences of symptomatic cases in
each municipality of Brazil are shown with intervals of
three weeks for simulations using weak mitigation; see
Figs. S10, and S11 of the SM [46] for other scenarios.
Full evolutions for all investigated mitigation parameters
are provided in Movies S1, S2, and S3 of the SM [46].
Epidemic waves propagating on average from the coast
at east, where the most populated regions are, to inland can be seen at a country level. Moreover, when the
epidemic is losing strength in the coast, the inland regions are still facing high levels of epidemic prevalence.
Maps and movies suggest that the epidemic starts in the
more populated places, usually the largest metropolitan
regions, and spreads out towards the countryside. This
is quite clear in the SP state, where the focus begins in
its capital city and moves westward into the countryside.
However, other states as PR and RS follow a different
pattern with multiple foci evolving simultaneously.
We analyzed the correlation between time T of the epidemic peak in the prevalence curves of immediate regions
and their distances D from the capital city of the respective state. Figures 6i)-k) show scatter plots of D vs T
for three typical correlation patterns found in the simulations. The remaining states are given in Fig. S12 of the
SM [46]. The SP state presents a strong correlation with
Pearson coefficient r = 0.69, statistically significant with
p-value less than 10−7 . For PR, no statistical correlation
is observed. Finally, MG has a moderate correlation with
Pearson coefficient r = 0.47, but statistically significant
with p-value of 10−5 . We classified the states according to the correlation between T and D in three groups:
not significant for which the p-value is larger than 0.02;
strong correlation that has statistical significance with
p < 0.02 and r > 0.6; and moderate correlation with
p < 0.02 and r < 0.6. The results are summarized in
Fig. 6h) where the map shows states colored according
to their classification. The structure does not change for
other mitigation approaches. The complete set of Pearson coefficients and p-values are given in Fig. S12 of the
SM [46]. States in the north (RR, RO, AP, AC, AM, PA,
and TO) have few immediate regions distributed in large
territories and are less connected. Thus, lack of correlations is not surprising. Moderate correlations in states
as MG, BA, and GO, with large but better connected
territories are due to the existence of multiple important
regions that play the role of regional capitals. However,
PR is an extreme case with many and well connected
immediate regions but total lack of correlations with the
capital city, Curitiba.

DISCUSSION

The wide territorial, demographic, infrastructural diversities of large countries as Brazil demand modeling
of a pandemic with geographical resolution higher than
the usual compartmental epidemic models, which can be
achieved using the metapopulation framework. We developed a stochastic metapopulation model and applied
it to the COVID-19 spreading in Brazilian municipalities. Performing simulations with different hypothetical
mitigation scenarios and considering the integration of
regions through inter-municipality recurrent mobility, we
have identified a high degree of heterogeneity and desynchronization of the epidemic curves between the main
metropolitan areas and other inland regions. The diversity of outcomes is observed in several geographical
scales, ranging from states to immediate regions, that
enclose groups of nearby municipalities with strong economic and social ties. The intenser the mitigation attitudes, the more remarkable are the differences. Moderate
or strong correlations between the delay of the epidemic
peak in the interior regions and distance to the capital cities of the respective state were observed for most
states with well connected immediate regions. However,
one exception was the PR state where there are diverse
epidemic foci evolving apparently independently of its
capital city.
Our simulations suggest that uniform mitigation measures are not the optimal strategy. In a municipality
where the peak without interventions would happen quite
later than the capital city of its state, it would delay
even more if strong mitigation measures are adopted synchronously with the capital. Nevertheless, such a place
probably would have to extend the mitigation for much
longer periods since once the epicenters of epidemics start
to relax their restrictions, the viruses will circulate fast,
reaching these vulnerable municipalities with most of
population still susceptible. This is the actual current
situation in Brazil at moment of resubmission. The social and economic impacts could be higher. On the other
hand, an eventual collapse of the local heath system,
a central question of the COVID-19 pandemic combating [24], in the countryside regions could also occur after
the larger metropolitan areas were under control, raising the possibility of unburdening the local healthy care
system. In fact, the desynchronization of the epidemic
curves and consequently of the health-system collapse
could be an asset in designing optimal resource allocations. One could prevent rapid expansion of the epidemic
through smaller municipalities flattening the curves as
much as possible in the main metropolitan regions. Beyond the positive consequences for their own health systems, this attitude would have the positive side effect of
delaying outbreaks in the countryside. Our study shows
that countryside regions are not safe in the medium-term
but could have precious additional time to prepare themselves.

AFTERWORDS

There is an interval of five months between conceiving
the first version of the present work [39] and this final
submission. As emphasized throughout the paper, our
aim was to simulate hypothetical scenarios rather to do
an accurate forecasting of real epidemic curves. Therefore, qualitative behaviors predicted in the simulations
can now be confronted with the real series observed a
posteriori. Several qualitative aspects predicted in simulations were indeed observed in real data. Maybe the
most remarkable one is the confirmation of the multiscale nature of the epidemic curves presented in Fig. 4 of
the main text and Figs. S4 to S7 of SM [46]. Figure 7
presents the epidemic incidences (new cases per capita
over a week) for intermediate regions of three states presenting typical behaviors observed in simulations. The
scenario of propagation starting from east coast towards
inland, with a considerable delay for the epidemic peak
in the latter, shown in Fig. 6 was also observed. Other
interesting phenomena were also verified in real data as,
for example, the unusual curve for the MA state and the
multifocal spreading in some states as PR, MG and GO.
Lets consider in more details the SP state shown in
Fig 7a), the one with highest number of COVID-19 cases
in Brazil. One can see a moderate dispersion for peak
occurrence time while in the capital city São Paulo it
happened considerably earlier. This picture is the same
drawn in Fig. S7a) of the SM [46]. For the state of RJ,
shown in Fig. 7b), the real data, with an exception for the
intermediate region of Petropólis, are remarkably similar
to simulations (see Fig. S5a) of the SM [46]), where intermediate regions peaks approximately synchronously with
the intermediate region of Rio de Janeiro. We are not
able to provide a specific reason for the different behav-

ior of Petropólis. The incidence curves for the CE state,
one of the first and more intensely impacted places by
COVID-19 in Brazil and shown in Fig. 7c), are remarkably heterogeneous with Fortaleza reaching the maximum much earlier and Cretéus much later than the other
intermediate regions. The incidence curve for the whole
CE state is very broad meaning that different regions
rule the state’ curve at different times, a scenario in almost perfect consonance with the simulation predictions
shown in Fig. S4 of SM [46]. We can also see significant
dispersion for immediate regions’ curves within a same
intermediate region, as illustrated for Sobral in Fig. 7d).
Intermediate region of Cretéus is composed only by two
intermediate regions and does not illustrate the point as
well as Sobral does. The maximum incidence also varied
considerably as, once more, predicted in simulations.
Quantitatively, a hypothetical scenario fitting better
more regions lies between weak and moderate mitigations. However, as one could guess, different hypothetical scenarios works better at distinct moments and places
confirming that quantitative forecasting and even nowcasting is a very dedicated issue.

This algorithm spends too much time with mobility of
susceptible and removed individuals since they can exist
in very large number for long times. We implemented an
optimization performing the mobility of susceptible and
removed in discrete times of 0.5 d. So, instead of moving
one susceptible individual at a time step, we move nSii Rij
from i to j at once and those who were not infected while
visiting patch j, return to i after 0.5 d. The same is
done for removed individuals. The simulations yield the
same results as the exact procedure within the statistical
uncertainties.

Appendix B: Parameters for a data-driven approach

Mobility. Mobility parameters were extracted from
(1)
public sources. Local commuting Cij was estimated
from the national census data of 2010 provided by
IBGE [52] as the number of people that daily commute
among municipalities to work or study. We excluded
from the dataset those travels corresponding to more
than 250 km, which are reckoned by airline travel data.

Commuting data lacking destinations were included, assuming proportionality to the complete-information portion of the dataset; see [53] for details. For the sake
(1)
of generality, the recurrent flux is a function Wij =
(1)

Fij (Cij ). We use the simplest case Fij (x) = x. Air
transportation data were obtained from the Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil (ANAC) [54] with the statistics of direct flights of 2014 considering the main nearby
metropolitan region as the origin and destination of passengers. Using boarding and landing statistics of passengers, one-connection flights were inferred and the num(2)
ber of passengers Cij flying daily from i to j was estimated [55]. In order to construct a recurrent mobility
(2)
(2)
(2)
with flights, we assume Wij = (Cij + Cji )/2, which
represents an effective flux. We do not have estimates for
duration of long-range travels. However, this does not
affect the current model since the homogeneous mixing hypothesis within the patches means that only the
number of individuals that stay part of the time in two
different patches actually matters and not who traveled.
(1)
(2)
The total recurrent mobility is Wij = Wij + Wij ; we
assume that it occurs daily, i.e, Tr = 1 d since both commuting and air travel data were obtained with this time
resolution.
Epidemiological parameters. We used epidemiological
parameters based on Ref. [24] which were mined from
analyses of early COVID-19 epidemic spreading on Hubei
province China [17, 20, 23]. The total time in the exposed and asymptomatic compartments was taken as
−1
−1
−1
µ−1
A + βU = 5.2 d [17]. We used µA = βU = 2.6 d.
The time for a symptomatic individual be removed was
−1
estimated as αR
= 3.2 d [20, 23]. For the truly asymptomatic individuals, we used the same recovering time of
−1
−1
−1
the presymptomatic ones, such that βR
= βU
+ αR
.
The infection rates λC = λU = λA = 0.06 d−1 [13, 24, 56]
and average number of contacts hki = 13 were estimated
to reproduce the scaling of Brazilian very early exponential growth, ∼ exp (0.3t), in reported cases of COVID-19;
see Fig. S13 in the SM [46]. These parameters provide an
effective infection rate λhki = 0.78 that represents an optimistic estimate nearer to the lower bounds estimated in
other studies of COVID-19 [20, 23, 24, 57]. The contact
of the individuals who were confirmed for COVID-19 was
depleted to a fraction b = 0.3 of their regular contacts.
(0)
The confirmation rate 1/αC = 10 d was calibrated together with the initial conditions to fit the amplitude of
confirmed case curves after 31 March 2020 and also the
total number of municipalities with confirmed cases in a
weak mitigation scenario. This is approximately twice
the incubation time implying that symptomatic individuals may not be tested even if tests are available. Up to
23 April 2020, Brazil had performed less than 1400 tests
per million inhabitants [38]. Assuming a time window
of 35 d for testing, we have approximately ζ = 1/40 000
d−1 per inhabitant. Due to the testing targeted only to
severe cases of respiratory syndromes adopted in Brazil
to the date of investigation, the transition from asymp-

11
tomatic to confirmed was neglected setting βC = 0; note
that the model can easily include such a transition if the
testing scenario changes.
Demographic parameters. Each patch represents a municipality with resident population given by IBGE using estimates of 2019 [35], while the respective fractions
of rural and urban populations were obtained from the
IBGE census of 2010 [52]. The population density was
determined using urban areas, obtained from high resolution satellite images, provided by Empresa Brasileira
de Pesquisa Agropecuária (EMBRAPA) [58]. Both fraction and density of urban population, and, consequently,
the number of contacts have broad distributions as can
be seen in Fig. S13 of the SM [46]. These are key
features to enhance the accuracy of the predictions beyond large metropolitan centers. Parameter a that controls the function f (x) was taken as a = 1/hξi where
hξi = 2791 inhabitants/km2 is the average urban population density of Brazil. The rural-urban contact matrix
was chosen as Cuu = Crr = 1 and Cru = 0.5. This last
choice only assumes that urban-rural contacts are significantly smaller than urban-urban or rural-rural interactions.
