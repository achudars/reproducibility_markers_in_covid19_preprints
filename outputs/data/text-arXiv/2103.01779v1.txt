Abstract—Many people around the world are worried about
using or even downloading COVID-19 contact tracing mobile
apps. The main reported concerns are centered around privacy
and ethical issues. At the same time, people are voluntarily
using Social Media apps at a significantly higher rate during
the pandemic without similar privacy concerns compared with
COVID-19 apps. To better understand these seemingly anomalous
behaviours, we analysed the privacy policies, terms & conditions
and data use agreements of the most commonly used COVID-19,
Social Media & Productivity apps. We also developed a tool to
extract and analyse nearly 2 million user reviews for these apps.
Our results show that Social Media & Productivity apps actually
have substantially higher privacy and ethical issues compared
with the majority of COVID-19 apps. Surprisingly, lots of people
indicated in their user reviews that they feel more secure as their
privacy are better handled in COVID-19 apps than in Social
Media apps. On the other hand, most of the COVID-19 apps are
less accessible and stable compared to most Social Media apps,
which negatively impacted their store ratings and led users to
uninstall COVID-19 apps more frequently. Our findings suggest
that in order to effectively fight this pandemic, health officials and
technologists will need to better raise awareness among people
about COVID-19 app behaviour and trustworthiness. This will
allow people to better understand COVID-19 apps and encourage
them to download and use these apps. Moreover, COVID-19 apps
need many accessibility enhancements to allow a wider range of
users from different societies and cultures to access to these apps.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Billions of people are using a wide range of Social Media
mobile apps every day. As shown in [1], there is a massive
spike in using Social Media platforms during the various
lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For
example, more than 2.7 billion people used Facebook every
month in the second quarter of 2020 [2], and WeChat mobile
app is actively used by over 1.2 billion people every month
[3]. Another relevantly new application called TikTok was
launched to the international market in September 2017. TikTok has around 800 million active users worldwide nowadays
[4]. Social media apps have played a great role in entertaining
and reconnecting people, friends, and families during the
lockdown, isolation, and social distancing. Productivity apps
have also seen a massive jump in usage [5]. For example,
Grammarly, which helps people to fix their grammar, spelling,
and punctuation, has over 10 million downloads [6].

Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has
completely changed the way we live and work across the globe
[7]. Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Teleworking Technology, and digital devices have played a huge
role in this major change. Moreover, these technologies have
greatly impacted the economy by saving jobs of people and
allowing businesses in different sectors to continue operating
during lock-downs. It has forced people to communicate and
deal with each other via online applications such as ZOOM,
Skype, and Microsoft Teams [8].
A new type of mobile app has appeared, required or advised
by governments and health officials [9]. These COVID-19
applications are an attempt by governments and technology
companies to minimise the spread of the virus. Besides traditional, manual contact tracing techniques, COVID-19 apps
assist authorities to rapidly find and track individuals that
have been exposed to the virus [10], [11]. They also help to
raise awareness about the virus via educational information,
including symptoms and how it can be spread. The success of
contact tracing apps depends on the percentage of the public
using these apps regularly [12]. The higher rate of adoption,
the higher percentage these tracing apps can help [13]. Contact
tracing apps collect data by tracing the movements of people,
identifying where they have been, with whom they have been
in close contact, and where they may have propagated the
virus. These data are usually encrypted, anonymous, and stored
historically rather than in real-time just to protect the privacy
of the users [14]. Without contact tracing apps, finding these
nearby contacts depends on individuals having the ability to
remember everybody they have been in close contact with.
However, many people are worried about using COVID-19
apps [15]. There are several reasons behind this, including
privacy issues, lack of trust and ethical concerns [15]. Also,
several media platforms play a huge role in swinging reality
to scare and panic the public and steer them away from using
COVID-19 apps [16]. On the other hand, Social Media &
Productivity mobile apps have lots of well-demonstrated and
publicised privacy and ethical issues. However, the public are
still using them, often without any apparent concerns, and even
at a higher rate during the pandemic [1], [17].
To better understand this behaviour, we carried out a
detailed, manual analysis of the privacy policies, terms &
conditions, and data use agreements in COVID-19, Social

Media & Productivity apps. We also carried out an automated
analysis of user reviews of COVID-19, Social Media & Productivity apps from both Google Play and App Store. Review
analysis covered five aspects – privacy, stability, advertising,
user requests, and uninstallation.
The key contributions of this work are:
‚ A detailed analysis of privacy-related policies of common
COVID-19 and social media apps, and we find the later
are far more prone to privacy and data mis-use than
COVID-19 apps.
‚ An analysis of nearly 2 million user reviews of common
social media apps and COVID-19 contact tracing and
education apps, and we find the later suffer from far more
severe accessibility and stability issues.
‚ Evidence-based recommendations for developers and promoters of COVID-19 apps to ensure they are technically
improved but also better understood by users.
II. M OTIVATION
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the number of daily
cases has been massively expanding [18]. As we write this
late 2020, Europe is facing the second wave of the virus and
no official or final vaccine has yet been produced [19]. The
authors of a key recent study [13] indicated that COVID19 apps can play a very important role in stopping the
global pandemic if 60% of the public download and start
using COVID-19 mobile tracing apps. Moreover, another study
indicated that even lower percentages of using the apps will
help in fighting the virus and decrease its propagation [12].
Many health officials and experts are advising the public to
download and start using COVID-19 mobile apps [20]. This
helps them to fight the virus in several ways since COVID-19
tracing mobile apps are more successful and effective if many
people start using them [12], [13].

“

Facebook: “We use location-related information such as
your current location, where you live, the places you like to
go, and the businesses and people you’re near. Location-related
information can be based on things like precise device location, IP
addresses, and information from your and others’ use of Facebook
Products (such as check-ins or events you attend) [21]”
TikTok: “We automatically collect certain information from you
when you use the Platform, including internet or other network
activity information such as your IP address, geolocation-related
data, unique device identifiers, browsing and search history (including content you have viewed in the Platform) [22]”
WeChat: ”Location Data is information that is derived from
your GPS, WiFi, compass, accelerometer, IP address, or public
posts that contain location information. Location information will
be disclosed (either to us, to other users, or both) [23]”
Grammarly: “As a rule, Grammarly employees do not monitor or
view your User Content stored in or transferred through our Site,
Software, and/or Services, but it may be viewed if we believe the
Terms of Service have been violated and confirmation is required
[24]”

apps

However, it is obvious that many people are worried about
downloading COVID-19 apps. This seems to be because they
believe it will help governments and tech companies to better
track them and they will become more exposed. Privacy issues
in COVID-19 apps are usually raised by people (users), Media,
and Human Rights organisations who are usually against the
governments who developed these apps [16], [25], [26].
Different governments around the world are enforcing social
distancing and lockdown measurements as advised by health
officials and experts [12], [13]. These lockdown measurements
are leading people to become more active online. Many
people are using Social media apps more frequently to help
them re-connect with their family, friends, and others [1].
For Social Media apps, privacy issues are usually raised by
governments or in some cases the app developers themselves,
such as YouTube and TikTok. Most users of these apps are not
highly involved in those discussions [27], [28]. There are huge
privacy and ethical concerns for Social Media & Productivity
apps which can be dangerous to individuals and even governments. For example, both Australian and US governments
are trying their best to prohibit Chinese-owned Social Media
apps such as TikTok and WeChat. This was because they are
claimed to collect large amounts of personal data about users,
which helps them build a strong understanding of those users
[29]. These collected data can be used in an unethical way,
such as the recent example in the US election where Facebook
and YouTube were used to potentially swing the US election,
which benefits opposing foreign governments [30]. On the 19
of September 2020, the US government decided to ban any
new downloads for TikTok and WeChat to protect the privacy
of their citizens from being exposed [31].
By looking at the privacy policies and data usage agreements for the most used Social Media and Productivity apps,
we can see many privacy issues that many users are not very
aware of them. Figure 1 shows parts from the latest privacy
policies showing that users’ data comes first not their privacy.
In contrast, an analysis of the privacy policies and data usage
agreements for most COVID-19 mobile apps shows that users’
privacy comes first not their data. Figure 2 shows a few parts
of their latest privacy policies. This motivated us to start
investigating and understanding users’ reviews.

“

COVIDSafe: ”No location data (data that could be used to
track your movements) will be collected at any time. No user will
be able to see the contact data stored on their device as it will be
encrypted. Contact data stored on a device will be automatically
deleted after 21 days [32]”
Corona-Warn-App: ”The system does not know who this person
met, nor when or where the encounter took place. No identification
is required for the app to identify that an encounter took place.
Furthermore, the open-source approach of the source code enables
the community to review the functionality of the app and to leave
comments [33]”

”

Fig. 2: Some excerpts of privacy policies of some common
COVID-19 apps

No work has yet been done to understand what motivates
people to use social media apps and yet refuse to use COVID19 apps. In this work, we aim to understand this contradiction
between what the privacy policies stated and end users’
perception. Understanding this behaviour is very important for
public health officials, experts, and technologists as it will help
them to improve app design, techniques, and privacy policies.
Subsequently, they will release apps updates that address the
public concerns based on these user reviews. This will increase
the download and adoption rates of COVID-19 mobile tracing
apps. In our study, we review and analyse how personal data
is handled in COVID-19 and Social Media mobile apps based
on their privacy policies and their terms & conditions. We then
try to understand people’s behaviour by analysing user reviews
for both COVID-19 and Social Media mobile apps. This user
reviews analysis includes privacy, stability, advertising, and
uninstallation related issues raised by users in both Google
Play and App Store apps.
III. M ETHOD
We carried out two types of analysis to compare COVID19 apps and Social Media & Productivity apps. First, we
did a manual analysis of their privacy policies, terms &
conditions and data use agreements. Second, we did a large
scale automated analysis of nearly 2 million user reviews for
COVID-19, Social Media & Productivity apps.
A. Dataset
For the privacy policies analysis, we manually analysed
42 official COVID-19 mobile apps from different countries
and compared them to Facebook, TikTok, WeChat and Grammarly mobile apps. We chose Facebook, TikTok, WeChat,
and Grammarly to represent commonly used Social Media &
Productivity mobile apps, as they are the most common apps
with the highest number of active users and downloads and
each app has a different usage purpose. All COVID-19 apps
included in the study are named in Table III.
For the user review analysis and to ensure diversity, we
ranked official COVID-19 contact tracing mobile apps by
both downloads and adoption rates. We then selected the top
used apps across different continents around the world. This
resulted in choosing 21 COVID-19 mobile apps to carry out
user review analysis as shown in Table I. For Social Media &
Productivity mobile apps, we decided to do our user review
analysis on Facebook, TikTok, WeChat, and Grammarly. We
also included an app ”COVID Symptom Study”, designed by
doctors, scientists and technologists in the United Kingdom.
They try to address privacy concerns raised by the public
against traditional COVID-19 contact tracing apps, as the app
only requests users to answer some questions about the virus
and shares important information about the virus to users.
B. RQ1 – How is personal data handled by COVID-19 and
Social Media mobile apps?
To address the privacy and data use agreement issues, we
developed a set of questions about app privacy and data

TABLE I: COVID-19 apps used in our user reviews analysis
management policies. This includes what kind of user data are
produced, stored, exchanged, and transmitted to third parties
and between whom these data are shared and why. These
questions will allow us to understand how users’ data are
handled by COVID-19 & Social Media mobile apps.
1) Is it an Open Source application?: Open source apps
have all application code publicly available for anyone to
download and review. This gives users the opportunity to
understand precisely how the app is working, what algorithms
does the app use and how does the app handle user data.
2) Are you forced to download or use it?: We wanted to
know if downloading the app is mandatory or it is voluntarily
downloaded by users. Some governments are forcing their
citizens and residents to download some apps for specific
reasons.
3) Is your data used out of the app scope?: This is a
critical point to understand ethical and privacy issues of an
app. If the app is using users’ data for other reasons that it is
supposed to, then there are serious issues.
4) Is your data deleted when it’s no longer needed?:
From a privacy and security perspective, mobile apps should
delete all the user data once it is no longer needed. The data
collected by any app should not last forever.
5) Does the app collect more data than it actually
needed?: Some mobile apps collect more data than they
actually need, not just the data that the user enters. Some of
these data are collected based on user behaviour and activity.
6) Is your identity masked?: Some mobile apps mask
user’s data in order to protect their identity. However, some
applications do not and anyone accessing the data can discover
user identity and behaviour with the app.
7) Can the App access everything you type?: Some mobile
apps have access to record and monitor every single letter users
type, which is a major ethical and security issue.
C. RQ2 – What are the key issues raised by the users
of COVID-19 and Social Media & Productivity apps as
evidenced in their users’ reviews?
To answer this question, we carried out a large scale
user review analysis to investigate how privacy, stability, and
advertising issues impacted users’ ratings. We analysed users’
requests and inquiries and how they affected the submitted
ratings. We also reviewed the main reasons why users decide
to uninstall or delete these apps.

Our app review analysis and classifying tool:
We developed a tool that downloads users’ reviews, translates
them to English, classifies them into five main aspects, and
summarises the results and findings. The five aspects used
in our classification are explained in Table II. We used our
tool to download and analyse just under 2 million user
reviews for Facebook, WeChat, TikTok, Grammarly, COVID
Symptom Study, and COVID-19 mobile apps. These reviews
are extracted for the period between 1st of April 2020 and
31st of August 2020; this is the period where the COVID-19
apps started to be used across the globe.

TABLE II: App aspects used in our user reviews classification
Our tool is written in Python and uses GooglePlay and
AppleStore open APIs to extract user reviews. Figure 3
illustrates the tool processing. If a review is not in English, it
uses the Google Translate library to detect the language of all
the reviews and translate them into English. It then classifies
reviews into five different app aspects based on used keywords,
chosen based on manually analysing over 23,000 user reviews.

IV. R ESULTS
A. RQ1 – How is personal data handled by COVID-19 and
Social Media mobile apps?
We analysed the privacy policies and data use agreements
for 42 official COVID-19 mobile apps. We did the same
analysis for Facebook, TikTok, WeChat, and Grammarly to
represent Social Media & Productivity applications.
1) Is it an Open Source application?: All Social Media
and Productivity applications included in our study are not
Open Source. There is no way to understand how the app
actually works or what happens to the user’s data unless you

read the data use agreements. These are often unclear, not
specific, and long, leading people to blindly accept the terms
and conditions. As shown in Table III, 57% of COVID-19
applications included in our study are open source. Application
code is publicly shared so it can be analysed to understand
precisely how it works, including what algorithms and technologies are used, where data is saved, and what happens with
the user’s data.
2) Are you forced to use it?: All Social Media and
Productivity mobile apps included in our study are voluntarily
downloaded by the users. No one is forced to download them
and their marketing is based on entertaining and providing
services to the users. However, 16% of COVID-19 applications
are mandatory to be downloaded by the users (citizens) as per
their government’s regulations. These regulations are set trying
to stop or slow the spreading of this virus.
3) Is your data used out of the app scope?: As shown
in Table III, only 30% COVID-19 apps included in our study
can use app user data out of the scope of the application.
However, this is nowhere near the extent of how Social Media
& Productivity apps can use app user data. User data is used
in different shapes and forms for Social Media & Productivity
apps. They use the information they collect to promote their
products or services, including to personalise features and
content such as stories, ads, suggestions for the user. To make
this personalisation unique and relevant for each user, they
use user’s behavioural attributes such as activities they are
involved with, interests, connections, preferences based on the
data they capture from and about the user and others including
friends, relatives, etc. Moreover, they collect user behaviour
and interaction with products or based on connections and
chats with certain people, check in to different places, or even
things they are connected to or shown interest in.
Location-related information: All Social Media & Productivity apps we included use location-related information,
primarily the user’s current location. Moreover, they collect
user’s current address and places they regularly visit, businesses they use, and people they are close by. Location-related
information are usually based on precise device location
(GPS). Sometimes users are tracked by their IP addresses,
check-ins, or events information. In contrast, 82% of COVID19 apps rely on Bluetooth contact tracing techniques and do
not need to use GPS or IP address. So COVID-19 apps provide
higher privacy for users since their location is never revealed or
signed in. They record anonymous key codes and anonymised
IDs are exchanged between nearby mobile devices. Hence, no
personal data can be identified or transferred. Moreover, in a
decentralised approach, the user data will only be stored and
processed locally on user phones and will never be transferred
to a central server. Bluetooth tracing is also more accurate than
GPS for short distance tracing.
Product research and development: All Social Media &
Productivity apps use user’s information to develop, test, and
improve their Products. User information is used in research
and some users are not aware that their data is used in this
way. However, COVID-19 apps do not use data for any product

TABLE III: Summary for Privacy and data use agreement between COVID-19, Social Media & Productivity apps. Some data
has been extracted from [34]
research and development.
Face recognition: If the user turns on face recognition
technology, this will give Social Media apps access user’s
photos, videos, and camera. No COVID-19 apps have that
option.
Ads and other sponsored content: Social Media &
Productivity apps use app user information, including their
actions and interests to select ads and for ad personalisation.
This also drives offers and other sponsored content that is
shown to users. None of the COVID-19 apps has any ads.
4) Is your data deleted when it’s no longer needed?:
Any app should delete user data once it is no longer needed.
Social Media & Productivity apps didn’t delete user data until

recently when they were forced to by new government regulations. Social Media shares user’s information with people
and accounts they share and communicate with. This often
includes user material and data that others post or re-share
about them, information about the active status of the user and
their interaction with applications, websites and integration
with third party apps and partners. For example, Facebook
claims that it deletes a user’s data within 90 days. However,
they acknowledge that they will not be able to delete any
data or information they have already shared with third-party
apps, websites, games, and services. User data can also be
shared with enforcement agencies and some have the power
to force users to hand over their logs, whistleblower ids and

sources. They can also identify and get the details for people
attending a protest, leaking information to media and even
release details of people in hiding from abusive partners, in
witness protection, etc.
In contrast, more than 66% of the COVID-19 apps automatically delete all the app user data once it is no longer used.
Some delete it immediately when a user deletes their account
or no longer uses the app. Others delete it automatically after
a specific period ranging between 1 to 4 weeks.
5) Does the app collect more data than it actually needs?:
Social Media & Productivity apps are usually data-hungry
and try to collect as much data as possible, whether or not
the user knows about it. They track and monitor the online
behaviour of users and their interacts with other users and
apps. Social Media Productivity apps collect user device
information, including device features and settings, signatures,
signals, configuration data, network and connections, and
cookie data. 42% of COVID-19 apps that we analysed collect
more data that the app actually needs, but is much less than
data mentioned above.
6) Is your identity masked?: None of the Social Media &
Productivity apps mask users’ data. 42% of COVID-19 apps
mask their user’s data to protect their privacy.
7) Can the App access everything you type?: Some Social
Media & Productivity apps access everything you type, such
as Grammarly. These apps will not work unless you allow
them to record and monitor every single letter you type. This
is a major ethical and security concern. On the other hand,
none of the COVID-19 apps have this issue.
B. RQ2 – What are the key issues raised by the users
of COVID-19 and Social Media & Productivity apps as
evidenced in their users’ reviews?
We downloaded, analysed and classified 1,978,418 user
reviews for Facebook, WeChat, TikTok, Grammarly, COVID
Symptom Study, and 21 different COVID-19 mobile apps.
All these user reviews were extracted from both GooglePlay
and App Store. The number of analysed user reviews and the
overall rating for each app is shown in Table IV.

TABLE IV: Overall average rating and number of analysed
user reviews
The extracted, nearly 2 million, user reviews have been
classified into five main aspects. These aspects are privacy,
stability, advertising, requests and uninstallation. The overall
percentage of each analysed aspect among the total number of
reviews are shown in Figure 4 and analysed below.

privacy issues within these apps were less than in COVID-19
apps as shown in Figure 4. However, in Figure 5, COVID-19
contact tracing apps user reviews discussing privacy-related
issues were more positive compared to Social Media & Productivity apps, which was very surprising to us. This shows
that users who downloaded and used COVID-19 contact
tracing apps were more satisfied from a privacy perspective
than users who were using Social Media & Productivity apps.
Many users indicated in their reviews that their privacy in
COVID-19 apps is much better handled than in Social Media
apps. Moreover, some users mentioned that their data is not
exposed and is more protected in COVID-19 apps compared to
Social Media & Productivity apps. The users of the Grammarly
productivity app were the most negatively concerned about the
privacy issues within the app since the app tracks every single
thing they type on their smartphones. The users of the COVID
Symptom Study app were the most satisfied from a privacy
perspective since the app does not track or trace them but gives
them useful information about the virus. Example quotes:

“

Facebook User: ”Privacy don’t exist!!! Please people read
Facebook terms and conditions, no privacy , crazy !!”
Grammarly User: ”This app wants permission to collect my
personal data such as passwords and credit card numbers. Take
care for all of you who want to use this!”
COVIDSafe User: ”Amazing how many people allow Google,
Apple, Facebook etc to access data yet will not trust an app that
has the ability to assist in saving lifes.”

The majority of these stability related issues were negative as
shown in Figure 6. By manually reviewing the stability classified user reviews within COVID-19 apps, the majority of these
reviews were reporting connectivity related issues with other
Bluetooth devices, as most COVID-19 contact tracing apps
are using Bluetooth for tracing, which affects the connectivity
with other devices such as headphones and smartwatches.

3) Advertising:
As shown in Figure 4, advertisement related issues were highly
reported within Social Media & Productivity mobile apps
compared to COVID-19 apps. None of the official COVID19 apps run ads in their algorithms and that is why it been
reflected in many COVID-19 app user reviews that they are
happy with the COVID app is not showing ads like many
other apps. For example, a user has written this review in
Facebook app ”Ads, ads and more ads My timeline feels like
it has more ads than posts. Stop with these advertisements.
Very annoying and would like to just finish the videos or posts
without seeing these”. On the other side, a user wrote this
review in Immuni app (Italian COVID-19 app) ”The only app
on my phone without popup ads. 10/10”. It is also shown
in Figure 7, that user reviews containing advertising related
issues in COVID apps were having better ratings compared to
Social Media & Productivity mobile apps.

COVID-19 apps didn’t interact or give feedback for the user

apps have miscommunication issues with their users. On the
other hand, most of the user requests within Social Media &

in star ratings across different apps are shown in Figure 8.

5) Uninstallation:
COVID-19 contact tracing mobile apps had a higher rate of
uninstallation rates than Social Media & Productivity apps.
COVID-19 apps have high uninstallation rates as most applications are based on Bluetooth, which negatively affects the
connectivity of the phone with other devices such as headphones, smartwatches, etc. Another reason for uninstalling

COVID-19 apps is due to some severe accessibility issues
many users encounter. Some of COVID-19 apps are limited
to be downloaded from a specific country store which makes
these apps inaccessible for residents or visitors who are using a
different country in their accounts. Moreover, another serious
accessibility issue is that some of COVID-19 apps involve
using a phone number for registration, however, these apps
only support local numbers. Since users will not be able to
register until confirming their local phone numbers, this issue
makes these apps inaccessible since some of the users are using their international phone numbers, this lead at the end that
users delete and uninstall the app. In addition, most COVID19 apps only support one language, which is usually the local
language for the country. This makes the app inaccessible for
people who do not understand this language, this issue leads
at the end that some users permanently delete or uninstall the
app. On the other side, most of the uninstallation that occurs
in Social Media & Productivity apps seems to be due to less
severe issues such as bugs, long loading times, etc. It was
commonly reported in the reviews that when users uninstall
these applications or reinstall or update them to the newer
version, these issues are usually fixed. The variations in star
ratings across different apps are shown in Figure 9.

C. Threats to Validity
Limited dataset of apps: We have only included the
official COVID-19 mobile apps in the study. In addition, we
have represented Social Media & Productivity categories by
Facebook, Tiktok, WeChat, and Grammarly apps.
Limited information: COVID-19 mobile apps have a significantly lower number of app reviews compared to Social
Media & Productivity apps. Moreover, lots of users just submit
a star rating without writing or leaving any feedback. Some
users only write a short feedback and they do not profoundly
express their user experience, issues, or concerns while using
the app.
Inaccurate translation: Since we are using Google API for
translating non-English user reviews to English. The translation can be inaccurate in minimal cases, which can lead to a
wrong classification.
Manual policy analysis: One of the authors did a detailed
analysis of app privacy and data usage policies, checked by
another author. However these policies may not accurately

reflect what the app actually does regarding user privacy and
data usage. Closed source apps are very hard to check to see
if they actually adhere to their claimed privacy and data usage
policies.
Automated review analysis: We used a large phrase dataset
to classify user reviews into the five categories and linked
classified review with overall app rating. Our phrases may be
inaccurate or miss some key words used in user reviews. We
manually checked phrases used in over 23,000 reviews to build
the dataset, reviews from many other types of apps, not just
those of social media and COVID-19 apps.
V. D ISCUSSION
We compared the privacy policies and data use agreements
of COVID-19, Social Media & Productivity apps. We analysed
nearly 2 million user reviews for these apps and categorised
them into five main aspects, privacy, stability, advertising, user
requests, and uninstallation. Below we discuss our findings and
implications for researchers and practitioners.
A. Findings
COVID-19 apps better support privacy and better limit
data usage: In our analysis of the privacy policies, terms &
conditions, and data use agreements for COVID-19 and Social
Media & Productivity apps included in our study, it was clearly
shown that privacy and personal data are more violated and
exposed in Social Media apps compared to most COVID-19
apps. Social Media & Productivity apps can use users’ data
and monitor their online behaviour and share these data and
information with third parties. Users of Social Media apps can
not really know or even control how their data can be stored,
exchanged, transmitted, and with whom and when. Moreover,
they do not have an easy way to fully delete their own data as
their data is already shared with third parties. So in the end,
the users of social media apps could not fully understand how
the data is being used and for what and whether if their data
is kept private or not. On the other hand, the data collected
by most COVID-19 apps are usually encrypted, anonymous,
and stored historically rather than in real-time just to protect
the privacy of the users. The majority of COVID-19 apps do
not record the real-location of the users’ but just a record
of anonymous key codes and anonymised IDs are exchanged
between near mobile devices using Bluetooth. Hence, no
personal data can be identified or even transferred between
different users. Moreover, in the decentralised approach, the
users’ data will only be stored and processed locally on their
phones and will never be transferred to a central server for
processing, which makes the tracing procedure very secured.
More COVID-19 app reviews talk about privacy issues:
Our analysis of app user reviews showed that privacy-related
issues were raised by a higher rate in COVID-19 apps than
in Social Media & Productivity apps included in our study.
Despite the high rate, the majority of COVID-19 app users
were actually satisfied with the privacy of the apps and were
giving high ratings. On the other side, privacy-related issues
were less raised in Social Media & Productivity apps but

were mostly negative reviews when raised. In user reviews,
many users made a comparison between COVID-19 and Social
Media apps and mentioned that their data is not exposed
and more protected in COVID-19 apps compared to Social
Media & Productivity apps. In addition, users of COVID-19
apps were satisfied, as the COVID-19 apps do not have any
advertisements. In contrast, the users of Social Media apps
were very dissatisfied with the large number of ads included
in these apps. Actually, all social media & productivity apps
included in our study are tracking users’ behaviour and online
activity to make personalised ads for every single user, which
does not occur in COVID-19 contact tracing apps.
COVID-19 apps are much less stable and accessible: Our
user review analysis highlighted that most COVID-19 apps
have many severe bugs, and instability issues compared to
Social Media & Productivity apps. From a software engineering perspective, this is most likely happening as COVID-19
apps are developed, designed, and tested in a short time span,
while on the other side, Social Media apps are way better
tested and the developers have plenty of time to fix any bugs
and issues and improve stability in their regular updates. The
majority of uninstallation happening in COVID-19 apps was
because of stability or accessibility serious problems. Some
of COVID-19 apps are inaccessible due to several reasons.
These accessibility issues prevented users from using these
apps. Most of these accessibility issues were very repetitive
in the reviews, however, they were not fixed in the updates of
the apps. This shows that the developers of most COVID-19
apps have miscommunication issues with their users.
B. Implications for Researchers and Practitioners
Many people have lots of privacy misconceptions about
COVID-19 apps and that is probably why they have low download and adoption rates. Our user reviews analysis showed that
the majority of people who decided to use COVID-19 apps are
actually satisfied with its privacy, but more dissatisfied with
its stability, accessibility, and bugs. To fight this pandemic
more effectively, health officials and technologists need to
raise awareness for the public about the mechanism of how
contact tracing apps actually work in a simple way so people
with weak technology background can understand. This will
allow the public to get their information from health officials
and technologists not from media and will encourage them to
download and start using these apps.
From a software engineering perspective, more research
needs to be done on how to design and implement COVID-19
apps – and indeed any future public service apps that need
to be rolled out quickly – in a way that allows users to be
sure that their privacy is not violated. This will help health
officials to collect data from users and at the same time, users
become satisfied as their privacy is not violated. For example,
apps should not ask for location, contacts, photos, camera, etc
access as this worries users. Most COVID-19 apps need major
accessibility and stability improvements.
Users need to be more aware that their privacy will be
severely violated if they decide to use many common Social

media apps and there is no way to prevent this as discussed in
the paper. Further techniques to better preserve user privacy
and limit data collection and use are needed for third party
apps, from phone platforms and app analysis. App developers
and organisations need to reconsider their lack of support
of user privacy and data collection and mis-use. Ultimately,
further government regulation about ensuring user privacy and
limiting collected data mis-used may even be required.
VI. R ELATED W ORK
A number of studies have investigated and analysed user
reviews for mobile apps. In [35], an exploratory study was
performed on what could impact the users to write an app
review. In [36], they investigated different factors that affect
user reviews, such as the correlation between the rating, price,
and the number of downloads. The authors of [37], proposed
a computational structure by adopting a semi-supervised algorithm in order to extract and rank insightful reviews. In
[38], the authors developed a semi-automated keyword-based
approach for mining user opinions in their reviews.
Multiple studies have reviewed privacy policies, terms &
conditions, and data use agreements for some social media
platforms [39]–[41]. Some work was done in investigating
COVID-19 apps. In [42], they investigated the ad transparency
mechanisms in social media. In [34], [43], they investigated
ethical and privacy aspects for COVID-19 apps.
So far, no work is done on mining and analysing both
user reviews and privacy policies, terms and conditions, and
data use agreements at the same time. In our work, we
investigated privacy policies of COVID-19 apps vs social
media and productivity apps and showed COVID-19 apps
have much more stringent privacy and data usage policies,
and some are open source for inspection. User review analysis
indicated many users appreciated this despite media claims to
the contrary. However, COVID-19 apps have many stability
and resource usage problems that must be better addressed.
We plan to conduct surveys and actual interviews with
people who refuse to use COVID-19 contact tracing mobile
apps and at the same time use Social Media apps. These
surveys will help us better understand why so many people
are voluntarily using Social Media apps without seeming to
have concerns but are very concerned regarding using COVID19 apps. We wonder if people trust private companies more
than governments to handle their personal data.
VII. S UMMARY
We analysed the privacy policies, terms & conditions and
data use agreements for the most commonly used COVID-19,
Social Media & Productivity apps. Moreover, we developed
a tool to extract and analyse nearly 2 million user reviews
for these apps. From our analysis, we found that, relative
to COVID-19 apps, Social Media & Productivity apps have
far more privacy and ethical problems. Many users indicated
in their user reviews that their privacy in COVID-19 apps
is much better treated than in social media apps. On the
other hand, relative to most Social Media apps, most of the

COVID-19 apps are much less stable and accessible. Our study
findings indicate that health officials and technologists need to
better raise awareness among individuals about the behaviour
and trustworthiness of COVID-19 apps in order to effectively
tackle this pandemic. This will allow individuals to better
understand and encourage them to download and use these
apps. In addition, COVID-19 apps need major accessibility
and stability enhancements to enable a broader variety of users
from various societies and cultures to access these apps.
