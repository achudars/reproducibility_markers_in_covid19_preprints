Abstract‚Äî During the COVID-19 pandemic and similar outbreaks in the future, drones can be set up to reduce human
interaction for medical supplies delivery, which is crucial in
times of pandemic. In this short paper, we introduce the use
of two evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization
(MOO) and tuning the parameters of the PD controller of a
drone to follow the 3D desired path.

I. INTRODUCTION
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as drones and
quadrotors, have gained significant attention during the last
decade. UAVs can be used in many fields, for instance,
inspecting and exploring new environments, monitoring
weather patterns to predict tsunamis and earthquakes, construction, monitoring gas and oil resources, and performing
jobs in dangerous environments with the advantages of high
robustness, reliability, stability, and low resource consumption [2], [3].
During the COVID-19 pandemic and similar outbreaks in
the future, drones can be set up to improve the everyday
lives of people. Drones are effective at reducing human
interaction, which is crucial in times of pandemic. To reduce
the risk of coronavirus infection, governments have asked
and encouraged people to remain in their homes. But then,
there should be a way to provide services and support for
people in their homes. Drones can be used for that purpose by facilitating contact-free interactions with healthcare
professionals, such as transporting blood or urine samples,
and delivering medical supplies like medicine or healthcare
devices. During a pandemic, hospitals are potential vectors
of contamination, so drones provide an efficient contactfree way to transport critical and necessary medical supplies.
Although medical supply delivery has been achieved by the
commercial company DJI [4], there are still many challenges,
some of which we focus on in this paper.
Considering system and environmental noise, many research studies have focused on developing a drone controller
to maintain stability, to reach the defined objective, or to tune
the controller‚Äôs parameters. The most well-known controllers
for drones are proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and

proportional-derivative (PD). Since they are widely applied
for drone control, there are a lot of studies on tuning
the parameters of these controllers. PID control includes
three adjustable gain parameters: the proportional gain Kp ,
integral gain Ki and derivative gain Kd . Algorithms proposed for this tuning problem mostly used aggregation-based
multi-objective optimization, which uses a weighted sum of
different cost functions to tune the controller parameters.
These tuning algorithms require the arbitrary determination
of weight coefficients and the main advantages of them are
simplicity and computationally efficiency.
Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) and particle
swarm optimization (PSO) are two popular optimization
algorithms, so we focus on extending these two algorithms
to MOO for drone control in this paper. PSO is based on
candidate solutions sharing positions in solution space with
each other. Each candidate solution, or particle, evolves its
position in solution space based on the locations of other
particles, until a desirable solution is found [5]. BBO is based
on islands sharing (or migrating) suitable features, which
represent independent variables in the problem solution [6].
Each island is considered as a possible solution for the
problem. Islands gradually evolve by migrating other islands‚Äô
features to become better habitats (i.e., better solutions) until
a desirable solution is found.
In this short paper, we use multi-objective optimization
along with evolutionary algorithms to tune the parameters of
the PD controller of a drone. The multi-objective function is
based on the tracking error of the four states of the system.
II. DYNAMIC M ODEL OF THE D RONE
We used the Euler-Lagrange model to derive the equations
of the drone [3]. The linear and angular position of the drone
are defined in relation to the inertial reference frame x-y-z.
The angular velocities p, q, r are defined in relation to the
body reference frame xB -yB -zB . The pitch rotation of the
drone around the y-axis is denoted by Œ∏, the roll rotation
around the x-axis is denoted by œÜ, and the yaw rotation
around the z-axis is denoted by œà. The center of mass of
the drone is located at the origin of the body frame. Vector
 = [x, y, z]T represents linear position, Œ∑ = [œÜ, Œ∏, œà]T
represents angular position, and ŒΩ = [p, q, r]T represents

angular velocity in the body frame. The drone contains four
rotors which induce angular velocities œâi , torques Mi and
forces fi . Thrust T = f1 + f2 + f3 + f4 is created by the
combined force in the z axis, and torques œÑ = [œÑŒ∏ , œÑœÜ , œÑœà ]T
are created in the body frame. Please refer to [3] and [1] for
the equation used for the dynamic model.
III. AGGREGATION M ETHOD
The main advantages of the aggregation method are simplicity and computational efficiency. The aggregated objective function based on the four most important criteria in the
PD controller is defined as
F (X) = œâ1 F1 (X) + œâ2 F2 (X) + œâ3 F3 (X) + œâ4 F4 (X)
(1)
where wi is the weight for each individual objective function,
which is set equal to 1. Each components of F (X) is defined
as
Z
Fi (X) = |Xi ‚àí Xi,d | dt
(2)
t

where i ‚àà [1, 2, 3, 4] indexes the objective, the state
Xi ‚àà {œÜ, Œ∏, œà, z}, and the desired (reference) state Xi,d ‚àà
{œÜd , Œ∏d , œàd , zd } [1].
IV. S IMULATION R ESULTS

A. Simulation Results of Aggregation Method
In Table I, the Min and Max columns show the search
space bounds for the PD parameters, the PD column shows
the values used for the conventional PD controller [7], and
the PSO and BBO columns show the mean values of the PD
parameter that PSO and BBO converged to after 30 iterations
and 5 trials. Figure 1 shows the mean and standard deviation
of state z for both MOPSO and MOBBO with 0.05 and 0.1
m overshoot, respectively. MOPSO has a better rise time,
about 1 sec, and a better settling time, about 3 sec. For more
results and discussions refer to [1].
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this short paper, we used evolutionary algorithms to tune
the parameters of a PD controller of a drone. The multiobjective function is defined based on the tracking errors
of the four states of the system, which in turn help reduce
settling time, overshoot, rise time and steady state error. The
results showed improved results compared to conventional
PD control.
