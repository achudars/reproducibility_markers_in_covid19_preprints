Received 28, July, 2020
I review some open questions relating to the large transverse momentum divergences in
transverse moments of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton correlation functions. I also explain, in an abbreviated and summarized form, recent work that shows
that the resulting violations of a commonly used integral relation are not perturbatively
suppressed. I argue that this implies a need for more precise definitions for the correlation functions used to describe transverse moments.

1. Introduction
Efforts to study the partonic structure of nucleons have motivated a search for
physical observables with specific sensitivity to intrinsic nonperturbative parton
transverse momentum. Classic examples are cross sections differential in a small
final state transverse momentum. In the discussions below, I will use semi-inclusive
deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), differential in the transverse momentum PhT of
the measured hadron,
dσ SIDIS

as a reference process since it is a typical example with relevance to several upcoming
experiments.
When access to the detailed behavior of Eq. (1) or similar processes at small
transverse momentum is not practical or convenient, it can be useful to instead
work with other, simpler observables that nonetheless retain sensitivity to intrinsic
transverse momentum. For example, integrating with a power n of a transverse

momentum component α retains sensitivity to polarization effects associated with
TMD parton density functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (ffs). These
weighted moments,

with n > 0, are related to spin asymmetries and are useful for accessing the large
variety of possible correlations between intrinsic transverse momentum and spin1–3
while preserving the simplicity of a transversely integrated quantity. In a parton
model with TMD PDFs, the polarization dependent TMD PDFs appear in Eq. (2)
as weighted transverse moments of the TMD PDFs,4 as will be discussed below.
Aside from simplicity, there are additional theoretical advantages to working
with transversely weighted moments of TMD correlation functions instead of transversely differential cross sections. Descriptions of Eq. (2) can make use of theoretically derived relationships between transverse moments of TMD correlation functions and (sometimes higher twist) collinear correlation functions.4 The most basic
integral relation of this kind connects the zeroth transverse moment of an unpolarized quark TMD PDF f1 (x, kT ) to the unpolarized collinear quark PDF f (x),
Z
d2 kT f1 (x, kT ) = f (x) ,
(3)

which follows directly from a number density interpretation of PDFs. Many other
integral relations analogous to Eq. (3) have been proposed for other types of TMD
correlation functions, usually involving some combination of weighted transverse
moments and higher twist collinear correlation functions. (This basic idea will be
further reviewed below.) Applied to Eq. (2) with n > 0, these integral relations
hint that effects normally associated with TMD PDFs might be accessed through a
kind of hybrid of higher-twist-collinear and TMD factorization theorems, and that
the advantages of one or the other might be exploited according to the needs of a
particular effort. Within this view, higher twist collinear correlation functions and
TMD correlation functions are seen as different ways of representing the same (or
roughly the same) underlying physics.
One specific situation where this idea has been put into practice is in the treatment of observables for which standard TMD factorization derivations fail to hold,
such as in the production of hadrons in hadron-hadron collisions.5, 6 Here, integral relations that connect TMD and collinear correlation functions are used to
relate transverse spin asymmetries in H1 + H2 → H3 + X collisions to TMD functions like the Sivers function in SIDIS,7–9 thus providing ways to compare intrinsic
transverse momentum effects across a variety of experimental settings while sidestepping complications with factorization that can arise in some processes when
intrinsic transverse momentum is involved.
Another application of the theory of transverse moments is their use in equations
of motion and Lorentz invariance relations.2, 10–12 These are systems of equations
that connect the large number of partonic correlation functions that can contribute

to an observable, thereby reducing the number of parameters needed for modeling or in phenomenological extractions. They have been incorporated into many
of the models currently used for phenomenological applications, for example in
Refs. 10, 13–16. Most of these Lorentz invariance and/or equations of motion relations involve a mixture of collinear correlation functions and weighted moments of
TMD correlation functions.
However, the mix of collinear and TMD ingredients in descriptions of observables like Eq. (2) raises questions concerning exactly which form of factorization
is relevant to a given situation. One problem is that integral relations that include
Eq. (3) and their transverse moment analogs involve ultraviolet divergences that
ultimately need to be regulated within some scheme choice. This connects naturally
to questions about the optimal treatment of QCD evolution in weighted observables. For processes that are inclusive in transverse momentum, the Q2 -dependence
is associated with the integration of transverse momentum up to very large values,
of order Q. A question, then, is whether an observable like

is governed mainly by the standard renormalization group techniques of collinear
factorization, as might normally be expected for something inclusive in transverse
momentum, or whether the known subtleties of TMD factorization (including rapidity divergences, non-perturbative evolution, etc) need to be taken into account,
as might be expected for an observable sensitive to intrinsic transverse momentum.
Notice that a modification of the large PhT behavior in Eq. (4), which can enter
theoretical calculations through regulators or cutoffs on large partonic kT , affects
the scale dependence when that modification depends on the kinematics of the process. Of course, if the range of integration is chosen to cover the entire kinematically
allowed region, it will depend on kinematical variables like Q2 . Thus, the evolution
in Eq. (4) depends on the details of how different regions of transverse momentum
are partitioned and included or excluded in the integration.
Below I will argue that these questions are more subtle than they might appear at first sight. When extended to transverse moments, relations analogous to
Eq. (3) have potentially large (perturbatively unsupressed) violations from the integration into large kT . Before discussing this, in Sec. 2 I will present a more detailed
overview of the different types of transverse momentum that enter into integrals like
Eq. (3). In Sec. 3, I will extend that discussion to transverse moments of correlation
functions. I will review the more interesting subtleties that can arise for weighted
correlation functions in Sec. 4. In Sec. 5 I will discuss some proposals for how they
might be dealt with in practice.
2. Sensitivity to intrinsic vs. large transverse momentum
For classifying transverse momentum in Eq. (1), it is convenient to use qT =
|Ph,T |/z, so this is the transverse variable I will use from here forward.

TMD factorization is valid in the region of transverse momentum much smaller
than the hard scale (qT ≪ Q). When qT is comparable to the hard scale Q, the
qT -dependence no longer factorizes into separate TMD functions of x and z. However, this large qT -dependence is, in principle, perturbatively describable in a purely
collinear factorization treatment, with all the transverse momentum generated directly in the hard, perturbative (but generally process-dependent) subprocess. The
full description of the cross section across all qT involves a TMD-based description at small qT combined with a collinear-based description at large qT , and these
two separate factorization treatments need to be merged in a consistent way to
achieve an accurate point-by-point description of the cross section. This is typically
implemented with an additive modification (a “Y -term”) to the familiar TMD description, which I will write here in abbreviated form in terms of the hadronic tensor
as
µν
W (x, z, qT )µν = W (x, z, qT )µν
.
TMD + Y (x, z, qT )

(5)

The first term, W (x, z, qT )µν
TMD , has the familiar structure of most TMD treatments
(e.g., Ref. 2) – there is a hard partonic tensor Ŵ (Q2 )µν and a convolution of TMD
functions:
W (x, z, qT )µν
TMD
Z
2 µν
≡ Ŵ (Q )
d2 k1T d2 k2T δ (2) (k1T + qT − k2T )f1 (x, k1T )D(z, zk2T ) .

(6)

The function f1 is an unpolarized TMD PDF and D is a TMD fragmentation
function. For brevity, I will continue to suppress flavor and Dirac indexes, polarizations, and auxiliary arguments like renormalization scales. The second term in
Eq. (5), Y (x, z, qT )µν , is the modification necessary to account for the large transverse momentum region (qT ∼ Q). A precise definition for Y (x, z, qT )µν can be
found in many places, see, for example, Ref.17 and references therein, although the
details are unimportant here. What matters for the present discussion is only that
Y (x, z, qT )µν is perturbatively calculable in collinear factorization, but is not factorizable into separate x and z dependent TMD correlation functions. It starts at
order-αs and accounts for the process-specific, nonfactorizable transverse momentum dependence that can arise at large qT .
The tail behavior at large qT starts at order αs , so it is reasonable to first try
approximating integrals over transverse momentum by neglecting Y (x, z, qT )µν and
assuming
W (x, z, qT )µν ≈ W (x, z, qT )µν
TMD .

where the second line has used Eq. (3) and its analog for the fragmentation function
D(z). Here, I have had to ignore the ultraviolet divergences discussed in Sec. 1, but
if I permit this I recover the natural expectation for the parton model on the last
line of Eq. (8). Ultimately, of course, it is important to go beyond this and to correct
for the ultraviolet ambiguity created by the divergent behavior. The appearance of
divergent integrals suggests that careful attention needs to be paid to the details of
the underlying operator definitions for the correlation functions. I will revisit this
point after repeating the above discussion for the more interesting case of weighted
observables in the next section.
Of course, the true cross section has a maximum kinematical qT , and the qT
integral is finite. This can be seen in the full factorization formula, Eq. (5), for the
cross section for all qT . Integrated over transverse momentum, it is

TMD

If the integrals extend to infinity, the first term on the right-hand side is divergent
just as in Eq. (8). However, the Y (x, z, qT )µν term contains an equal and opposite
ultraviolet divergence, assuming it is constructed via the usual subtraction procedure, so the details of any ultraviolet regulators cancel between the W (x, z, qT )µν
and Y (x, z, qT )µν terms.
Writing the qT -integration as in Eq. (9) highlights the fact that large-kT divergences in integrals like Eq. (3) are symptoms of having neglected the qT ∼ Q
behavior in the Y (x, z, qT )µν term in approximations like Eq. (7). The ambiguities introduced by large kT regulators, therefore, cannot be completely resolved
just by addressing the details of W (x, z, qT )µν alone, but instead require a treatment of Y (x, z, qT )µν . But since Y (x, z, qT )µν is not TMD-factorizable, confronting
the large-kT ambiguity problem in relations like Eq. (3) leads to considerations of
behavior outside of what is normally understood to be the domain of TMD physics.
There is no barrier in principle to simply including a complete treatment of the
qT ∼ Q behavior in Y (x, z, qT )µν by using existing collinear factorization extractions for collinear PDFs and ffs. This has been a significant challenge in practice,
however, because those large transverse momentum calculations tend to show significant tension with data18–21 in the unpolarized case. It is hoped that the tension will
be resolved by future refinements in the implementation of collinear factorization
at large qT , and by doing this in parallel with TMD phenomenology.
For applications to nucleon structure studies it might reasonably be argued that
the very large perturbative transverse momentum in Eq. (2) is not of primary inter-

est anyway, and that the integral should be defined with a cutoff on qT at fixed and
comparatively moderate momentum so as to amplify the relative contribution from
truly intrinsic or nonperturbative transverse momentum. In practice, this might be
implemented by using parametrizations for TMD correlation functions, like Gaussians with fixed widths, that sharply suppress very large qT behavior. However,
without the partonic transverse phase space growing with Q, it cannot be assumed
automatically that evolution will follow the typical DGLAP-type behavior characteristic of most transversely integrated observables. This leads back to the question
posed after Eq. (4).
In the next section, I will extend the above discussion to weighted observables like
Eq. (2). The large transverse momentum issue will turn out to be more interesting
in this case for reasons to be explained in Sec. 4.
3. Weighted observables
The Eq. (7) approximation applied to Eq. (2) for n = 1 and a component α of
transverse momentum is analogous to Eq. (8). It is,

(10)
In this way, the weighted cross section gets expressed in terms of the weighted
transverse moments of TMD PDFs (on the third line) and the TMD ffs (on the
fourth line). Equations analogous to Eq. (7) then connect the weighted transverse
moments of TMDs to twist-3 collinear functions. For a sketch of how this works,
recall that a general TMD PDF can be expanded in terms of polarization dependent
functions,
f (x, kT ) = f1 (x, kT ) −

where f1 (x, kT ) is the unpolarized quark TMD PDF and f1T
(x, kT ) is the Sivers
TMD PDF. The “· · · ” represents other TMD functions that I do not consider here. A
similar decomposition applies to the fragmentation function D(z, zkT ). Integrating
⊥
as in Eq. (3) causes contributions like the f1T
(x, kT ) term to vanish due to the odd
factor of kiT . However, in the integral in parentheses on the third line of Eq. (10)
it does not vanish. Instead it produces a factor proportional to the integral

The asymptotic large kT behavior of f1T
(x, kT ) is 1/kT4 , so here again there is an
ultraviolet kT problem. Completely removing the large kT ambiguity means includµν
ing both W (x, z, qT )µν
in the weighted integral, analogously
TMD and Y (x, z, qT )
to Eq. (9).
However, if one momentarily sets aside the treatment of ultraviolet divergences
in the operator definitions of correlation functions, it is possible to show that the
extra power of transverse momentum translates into a derivative and then to derive
an integral relation analogous to Eq. (3) but with a twist-3 collinear function on
the right-hand side,
Z

The T (x) on the right side is a twist-3 quark-gluon-quark collinear correlation function often called the Efremov-Teryaev-Qiu-Sterman (ETQS) function.22–25 Equation (13) was first derived in Ref. 4. The minus sign on the right-hand side of
Eq. (13) is consistent with a definition for the TMD PDF with a future pointing
Wilson line, as is needed for SIDIS.
In the next section, I will contrast the different types of violations that can arise
from large kT in Eq. (3) and Eq. (13).
4. Transverse momentum regulators and renormalization
Ultraviolet divergences in the transverse momentum integrals of the previous sections create the possibility for violations of relations like Eq. (3) and Eq. (13).
Addressing this requires precise statements of the operator definitions used for
correlation functions, including whether operators are renormalized or bare and
whether operator products are defined with renormalization or with cutoffs. Note
that renormalization and cutoff regularization are not exactly the same.26 In PDF
renormalization (see, e.g., Sec. 8.3 of Ref. 28), a bare PDF f0 is defined first, with
bare fields and parameters. Then, a renormalized PDF is defined by applying a
generalized renormalization factor Z,
f renorm ≡ Z ⊗ f0 ,

(14)

where ⊗ is the usual integral convolution in longitudinal momentum fraction. In a
scheme like MS, Z implements the subtraction of ultraviolet poles. A renormalized
PDF defined in this way is not generally reproduced by integrating a TMD PDF up
to a cutoff. (The TMD PDFs are defined with their own, separate renormalization
procedures.)
In the discussions that follow, TMD and collinear PDFs and any of the other
correlation functions should be understood to be defined in any of the usual ways
relevant to applications, with renormalized operators and renormalized operator
products for collinear correlation functions. The treatment of lightcone divergences
and Wilson lines in TMD functions should be understood to follow any of the now
standard approaches,27–40 although the precise details of this particular issue will

be unimportant for the discussion below. For collinear PDFs and other collinear
correlation functions, there are a number of advantages to using renormalized operator matrix elements as definitions, with standard renormalization prescriptions like
MS. Firstly, they possess desirable features like the automatic cancellation of lightcone divergences.26 Secondly, properties like equations of motion and sum rules for
composite operators are exactly valid only in a limited number of such schemes,41
including MS. Finally, the use of schemes like MS is already pervasive in existing
phenomenological treatments of collinear functions that include higher order QCD.
Thus, all collinear functions will be assumed to be treated in this way below.
Using integrals like Eq. (3) and the left side of Eq. (13) with actual TMD correlation functions that have been extracted from phenomenological fitting requires
cutting off or suppressing the large kT region while leaving the small and physically
more relevant kT contribution unchanged. This can be done smoothly, for example
by using a Gaussian parametrization for the large kT tail, or with a sharp cutoff,
though the general observations below are independent of such choices so I will use
hard cutoffs for simplicity.
In Eq. (3), for example, the integral on the left side is to be defined with a
large transverse momentum cutoff kc . If the right side is the standard renormalized
unpolarized quark PDF, then the size of a violation of Eq. (3) is measured by the
quantity
!
Z kc2
2
dkT f1 (x, kT ) − f (x; µ) .
(15)
∆f ≡ π
0

It is straightforward to verify that calculations of ∆f follow a typical collinear
factorization pattern. Namely,
!
Λ2QCD
,
(16)
∆f = C (x, αs (µ)) ⊗ f (x; µ) + O
kc2
where C (x, αs (µ)) is a hard coefficient that starts at order αs (µ) if kc ∼ µ. Most
relevantly here,
∆f = O (αs (kc )) ,

(17)

so that asymptotic freedom ensures ∆f → 0 when both kc and µ are fixed to some
hard scale Q and Q/ΛQCD → ∞. This is consistent with the natural intuition that,
because the violation of Eq. (3) is from a hard kT tail, the effect of a nonzero ∆f
is likely to be perturbatively suppressed.
Given these observations regarding the unpolarized correlation functions, it is
natural to expect something similar in relations involving polarization dependent
functions such as Eq. (13). The analog of Eq. (15), for example, is

The conclusion of Ref. 42, however, is that the analogous arguments lead not to
something like Eq. (17), but rather to
 2
kc

(19)

up to overall factors, where m is a small nonperturbative mass scale, roughly the
size of ΛQCD (see Eq. (13) of Ref. 42 and the surrounding discussion there).
The asymptotic behavior of the strong coupling is αs (kc ) ∼ 1/ ln (kc /m), so the
asymptotic freedom of QCD does not lead to a suppression of Eq. (19). It is less
obvious in the polarization case, therefore, that neglecting violations of Eq. (13) is
a good approximation.
5. Summary
Equation (19) implies a stronger ambiguity for the definition of the integral on the
left-hand side of Eq. (13) than might be expected. Since it is not a normal type
of perturbative correction, it can have a potentially greater impact on observables
than the analogous quantity in the unpolarized case, Eqs. (16)–(17).
Reference 42 argued that the resolution to this problem can be guided by the
type of physics of greatest interest for a particular application. Thus, for instance,
applications to nucleon structure might use a fixed and relatively low regulator on
transverse momentum in Eq. (12). In such cases, Ref. 42 proposes taking the relation
in Eq. (19) to define a scheme for the ultraviolet behavior of T (x). The advantage of
such a scheme is that it preserves the parton model picture embodied by relations
like Eq. (3) and Eq. (13) along with its applications, some of which were mentioned
in the introduction. Furthermore, it avoids having to directly address the question
of the Y -term correction by eliminating the qT ∼ Q contribution.
However, this low transverse momentum cutoff, along with Eq. (19), means
this definition likely does not preserve the normal renormalization group evolution
of T (x). (Note that Eq. (19) implies that different numbers of large logarithms are
included in the cut off TMD PDF and the renormalized collinear function.) Instead,
TMD evolution should be implemented first on the TMD PDF inside the integrand
of Eq. (18). This will be relevant to future refinements to the treatment of evolution
in applications to phenomenology such as Ref. 43. More work along these lines is
needed.
