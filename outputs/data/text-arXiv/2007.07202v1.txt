Abstract
Background:
Wuhan, China was the original epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of the current study
is to understand the infection transmission dynamics before intervention measures were taken,
such as issuing a lockdown for the city and other social distancing policies.
Methods:
Data and key events were searched through pubmed for medical literature and internet for
Chinese government announcements and Chinese media reports. Epidemiological data including
R0 and infection were calculated using data extracted from variety of data sources.
Results:
We established a timeline emphasizing evidence of human-to-human transmission. By January 1,
2020, Chinese authorities had been presented convincing evidence of human-to-human
transmission; however, it was until January 20, 2020 that this information was shared with the
public. Our study estimated that there would have been 10,989 total infected cases if
interventions were taken on January 2, 2020, vs 239,875 cases when lockdown was put in place
on January 23, 2020.
Conclusions:
China’s withholding of key information about the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and its delayed
response ultimately led to the largest public health crisis of this century and could have been
avoided with earlier countermeasures.

Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak that originated from Wuhan, a major transportation hub of
China, had caused more than eight million confirmed cases and 444,563 deaths in the world as of
June 17, 2020 [1]. Multiple countries reported having their first cases imported from Wuhan or
by a returning visitor to Wuhan [2-7]. Thus, it is important to understand the infection
transmission dynamics within the epicenter where the virus first originated, especially before
intervention measures were taken such as issuing a lockdown of the city and other social
distancing policies. In spite of the worldwide interest in understanding the initial phase of the
pandemic in Wuhan, researchers’ efforts have been hampered by lack of transparency including
the lack of comprehensive and reliable data from this period.
By the time of the lockdown on January 23,2020, the Chinese official report for the
COVID infection in Wuhan is 495 cases. However, media reports from China suggest that the
official confirmed cases in Wuhan before and around the lockdown were significantly
underreported. This under-reporting seems to be due to multiple factors, such as limitation of
testing and surveillance capability [8,9]; limited quantity of test kits provided to local hospitals
[10] and generally low testing accuracy (low sensitivity, 30-60%) [11]. More importantly,
government policies and intervention, such as the different versions of diagnostic criteria, seem
to have a heavy influence on the information sharing and preparation for the pandemic [12].
The current study investigates the early outbreak through search and screening into
various types information, including interviews with those who were in direct contact with
patients, Chinese media reports and government reports. We found that the key information of
human to human transmission had not been reported by the Chinese government for at least three
3

weeks, despite convincing evidence. We provide our estimates of the impact of this delay of
three weeks and other epidemiological parameters related to COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan,
before the lockdown and other public quarantine measures on January 23, 2020.
Methods
Data Collection
In an effort to reconstruct what happened before and during the lockdown in Wuhan, we
screened media reports published in mainland China from January to April 2020, covering the
details about various events and measures taken by local hospitals and government on various
levels concerning the Wuhan lockdown. We have complied the epidemic relevant events into a
timeline so that the scientific community will have information that can potentially impact
understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 virus in Wuhan, China.
We searched and profiled data through the following different information channels.
1). Pubmed search using keyword “COVID-19”. Search results were screened for daily incidence
by PCR diagnosis from admitted patients. Two references were found [13, 14]. [Appendix A,
column B].
2). Screening of published Chinese media reports with recounts from local physicians and
hospitals. Search results were screened for daily and total hospitalization cases including the
PCR confirmed cases and patients with high suspicion of COVID infection with severe
symptoms. We found the following Chinese media reports and government announcements [1519] [Appendix A, column C].

4

3). Daily new incidences with a typical pattern of COVID infection on CT images with features
strongly correlated to the known COVID pattern in two radiology departments in two hospitals
in Wuhan from media reports [9] [Appendix A, column H].
Data Classifications
We have created three data categories for our calculations:
A: Hospitalized patients with COVID infection confirmed by PCR in Wuhan citywide.
B: Hospitalized patients due to COVID infection in Wuhan citywide (including highly suspicious
clinical cases not yet confirmed by PCR or local diagnosis criteria).
C: Daily symptomatic incidences based on daily cases with COVID patterns identified by
radiologists from CT reading rooms from two similarly sized Grade III Level A (tertiary)
hospitals.

Timeline of COVID-19 Outbreak Before Lockdown and Chinese Government’s
Reaction
A brief timeline of COVID-19 outbreak, focusing on features of human-to-human

transmission, before Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020, is listed in Figure 1 [20, 21] (for a
more comprehensive timeline and its references, see Appendix B).
I.I

Patients in family clusters suggestive of human to human transmission
On December 27, 2019, an elderly couple presenting with fever and dyspnea was

admitted to Wuhan Xinhua Hospital ICU. On the next day, the son of this couple was called to
Xinhua Hospital. The CT imaging of all three in the family showed similar findings. This family
5

cluster demonstrated an obvious clue of “human to human transmission.” ICU chief, Dr. Zhang
Jixian reported these three cases to the hospital leadership. On December 29, the vice president
of the Xinhua Hospital, Dr. Xia Wenguang called for a clinical conference on seven similar
cases, including this family cluster of three. On the same day, Dr. Xia reported to the City and
Provincial Health Commissions and CDCs. He asked for starting emergency protocol activation.
On December 29, 2019, the ER in Wuhan Central Hospital reported four similar cases to
the Hospital Public Health Office, which reported to local county CDC. Among these patients,
there was a pair of mother-son, another example of human-to-human transmission.
On 12/30/2019, one physician in Xinhua Hospital reported symptoms. This was
confirmed on Jan 11, and she is the 2nd case of a medical staff infected in Xinhua Hospital.
I.II.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of airway samples suggestive of SARS-like

coronavirus
On December 27.2019, the NGS result of patient A was orally reported back to Central
Hospital by Vision Medicals (Guangzhou, China) by phone, it was claimed to be a coronavirus
that is “Bat SARS like”. The sequencing results of patient A were forwarded to Wuhan Institute
of Virology (WIV), and WIV confirmed the high similarity to SARS-like coronavirus from bat.
On December 30, 2019, Beijing CapitalBio MedLab (北京博奥医学检验所) reported
sequencing results of patient Chen 2 as “highly suspicious for SARS” to the Central Hospital.
Dr. Ai Fen, ER Chief in Central Hospital, reported sequencing results to Hospital Public Health
Office and Hospital Infectious Disease Department. She also forwarded the report to ER doctor’s
Wechat, which triggered a chain of events spreading the warning, including message sent out by
Dr. Li Wenliang. On January 1, 2020, BGI group (Huada Gene) reported sequencing results of 3
6

cases of pneumonia in Wuhan which harbored viral genome sequences showing 80% similarity
to SARS virus to Wuhan City Health Commission.
I.III. Non-acknowledgement of human-to-human transmission and intervention in case
reporting
As Table 1 demonstrates, by December 30, 2019, there had been convincing evidence of
human-to-human transmission, including clinical presentation of patient clusters and viral
sequencing results. Despite this, on December 30,2019, the Wuhan City Health Commission
issued two emergency policies, the 2nd one stating that “no one or institution is allowed to
disclose information about the pneumonia (of unknown etiology) without authorization.” On
December 31, 2019, the Wuhan City Health Commission announced that recent pneumonia cases
seen in some hospitals were related to the Wet Market; no obvious findings of “human to human
transmission” and no infection of medical staff.
On December 31, 2019, the Chinese National Health Commission dispatched a panel of
experts to Wuhan for investigation. After visiting Wuhan, they announced no evidence of
“human to human transmission” on January 10, 2020. It was not until January 20, 2020 that the
National Health Commission announced the human to human transmission by COVID-19. Three
weeks passed from the emerging evidence of human-to-human transmission.
During this period, Chinese physicians sensed the risk of outbreaks and reported
promptly; Chinese researchers also cultured and isolated the virus and obtained the viral genome
sequence. On the other hand, while the Chinese government started to communicate with
international organizations, the severity was under-reported and “human to human transmission”
was denied. Other counterproductive measures taken by the Chinese government included, but
7

were not limited to, prohibiting medical staff from releasing information to public, prohibiting
discussions among medical staff on the “pneumonia of unknown etiology”, prohibiting staff
from wearing PPE (personal protection equipment), prohibiting 3rd party labs from doing viral
sequencing, making diagnostic criteria difficult for diagnosis confirmation, deleting reported
cases, disciplinary action against “whistle blowers” and closure of the lab which shared viral
genome information with the international community.
Wuhan local and the Chinese National CDC has implemented at least seven different
versions of diagnosis criteria since the outbreak, thus making it hard to identify and understand
the infection number in a consistent manner [12]. If taking infection with mild or no symptoms
into account, a study estimated that 86% of infected individuals were not documented in China
before January 23, 2020 [22]. Policies and interventions for reporting (holding cases for 12 days)
made the confirmed cases artificially low, as reported by mainland Chinese media [15,16, 23].
I.IV.

Reaction of Taiwan and Hong Kong governments
By comparison, the Hong Kong and Taiwan governments were closely monitoring and

preparing for the coming epidemic during this critical time. On December 31, 2019, Taiwan
inquired of China and the WHO for details about the “Atypical Pneumonia patients quarantined”
with a strong suspicion of human to human transmission. Taiwan started border infections
screening on direct flights from Wuhan to Taiwan. On December 31, 2019, Hong Kong media
reported the presence of “new SARS” in Wuhan. The Taiwan and Hong Kong governments had
press conference almost daily on the epidemic.

Estimation of Epidemic in Wuhan

II.I.

Calculation of R0
Assuming the ratio of symptomatic cases in the total infected population is constant, and

the proportion of symptomatic patients seeking medical help remains constant over the time, we
use the growth rate of hospitalized people, PCR test positives or CT positives in our dataset as
the proxy for the growth rate of the infected population.
R0 represents the average number of secondary cases that result from the introduction of a
single infectious case in a totally susceptible population during the infectious period. Wallinga
and Lipsitch have pointed out that the exponential growth rate (r) during the early phase of the
outbreak can be used to calculate the R0 by using the formula R0 = 1/M(-r), where M is the
moment generating functions of the serial interval (SI) distribution of the disease [24] .
We assumed a gamma distribution for the serial interval, with 7.5 as the mean and 3.4 as
standard deviation, based on a prior study of Wuhan data of the initial epidemic stage [13]. R
package “R0” is used to provide estimates of the R0 and its 95% confidence interval [25].
In the Feb. 3 speech, Chinese President Xi told China’s most powerful leaders that he had
“continuously given verbal and written instructions” since Jan 7, and he had personally ordered
the quarantine of about 60 million people in Hubei province later in January. We found PCR
reported cases decreased after January 9, 2020, while no countermeasure had been taken by then.
The decrease in reporting could well be driven by political reasons. Thus, we utilize (dataset A)
PCR results from December 1, 2019 to January 8, 2020 (the growing portion which is less
subject to political intervention) [Figure 2], R0 is estimated to be 3.12, with 95% confidence
interval as (2.69, 3.64) [Table 2].
9

Patients without symptoms are highly unlikely to be tested for COVID in Wuhan, they
will get CT scans only if they have symptoms that are either severe or causing respiratory
distress; thus, the CT rooms readings provide samples with severe symptoms. The CT data (data
set C) fit well with a Poisson log linear regression model for the daily new incidence. The
coefficient of the Poisson model is 0.179 (0.151, 0.207), which implies 3.565 doubling time and
higher R0 than the PCR based R0. However, due to the limited size of this dataset, this study will
mainly use the PCR based R0 for estimation.
Based on field observation, around 60,000 more people visited febrile clinics in Wuhan
from January 22 to January 27, 2020 with symptoms, and 3,883 were observed at clinics who
could not be admitted due to lack of beds [Appendix A, column I]. Chinese media reported that
shortage of hospital beds wasn’t eased until February 15, 2020. The growth of the hospitalized
population was subject to the capability of Wuhan for adding beds dedicated to COVID patients.
Thus, we are not going to use the daily incremental hospitalization for the R0 estimation, since it
could likely produce an underestimate.
II.II. Estimate of incidence in Wuhan based on the SEIR model
Susceptible–exposed–infectious–removed (SEIR) model is applied to estimate the
incidences. The following epidemiologic parameters are assumed in the estimation [13].
1. December 1, 2019 as the initial outbreak time, January 23, 2020 is the 54 th day.
2. 5.2 days as the mean incubation duration
3. 2.3 days as the mean infection duration
4. 11.5 days as the median time from initial hospital admittance to discharge [26]
5. 2% case fatality rate (Chinese official figure of the early stage in Wuhan)
10

6. 14 million population in Wuhan before lockdown [27]
With the estimated 3.12 R0 based on the PCR results and the SEIR model, it is estimated
that by January 23, 2020, Wuhan had 239,875 infected people, among them 149,170 were in the
stage of incubation and were infectious. The new daily latent and infectious cases are estimated
to be 23,774, 7,148 respectively on January 23, 2020. [Figures 3A]
II.III. Hospital admission rate: government official report vs estimation
The Chinese official report for Wuhan suggested a 100% admission rate for COVID
patients diagnosed in Wuhan, China [28]. However, it was very hard to secure a bed around the
lockdown period in Wuhan, and many residents were told to go back home and self-quarantine
[29]. By December 31, 2019, the officially reported admitted number is 46, our analysis
estimates a total of 333 (105, 1,219) infectious cases by then, which implies 13% admission rate
(46/333). On January 20, 2020, it was reported the 2,000 beds dedicated to COVID were all
occupied, we estimated 14,804 (2,485,104,298) infectious cases cumulated, and a 13.5%
admission rate. The above hospital admission ratio was based on the estimates of infectious
cases, many infected but no longer infectious cases needed medical care as well.
III.

Estimation of Impacts of the Delay of the Three Weeks
The period of the three weeks before the lockdown was a crucial time in the early stage

of the epidemic. If countermeasures would have been taken on January 2, 2020, immediately
after the authorities were informed about the human-to-human transmission, the epidemic
development would have taken a completely different trajectory. If we assume the intervention
reduces the daily contacts of the infectious by 2/3, our study estimated that there would have
been 10,989 total infected cases, vs 239,875 cases when lockdown was taken place on Jan 23,
11

2020. The group of people with infectivity (infectious+ latent) would be reduced from 149,170
to 1,916, and the daily new cases of the infectible group would be reduced from 30,922 to 10 on
January 23, 2020 [Table 3] [Figure 3B]. This demonstrates that if countermeasures would have
been taken three weeks earlier, the epidemic would have been largely contained by January 23,
2020.
By the time the authorities locked down Wuhan, about five million people (about 5/14 of
the total Wuhan population) had left Wuhan, resulting in a potential outflow of 41,008 exposed
cases and 12,267 infectious cases, contributing directly to one of the most serious public health
crises of this century.
The above estimations assume the intervention reduces the daily contacts of the
infectious by 2/3. After the long delay, Wuhan took a drastic lockdown measure to contain the
virus spread, which reduced the daily contacts of the infectious by more than 2/3. If a strict
intervention would have been applied on January 2, 2020, we would have seen an even larger
decline in the epidemic spread.
Discussion
Potential impact of the delay of the critical three weeks
Some other scholars have done hypothetical studies of countermeasures. As Yang et al.
suggested, using a modified SEIR and AI prediction of the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in
China, “If the introduction of interventions was delayed by five days, the transmission
coefficient would have been much greater due to the increase in the average number of contacts
with an infected person daily.” They also pointed out that a five-day delay in implementation
would have increased the epidemic size in mainland China three-fold [30]. Lai S and associates
12

pointed out that if interventions in China could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or
three weeks earlier, cases could have been dramatically reduced by 66% (IQR 50% - 82%), 86%
(81% - 90%), or 95% (93% - 97%), respectively [31].
Our study has demonstrated that the delay was real, there is 21 day interval between
December 31 and January 20 when China acknowledged the human to human transmission, and
24 days to January 23 when lockdown took place. The experience of Hong Kong and Taiwan
has shown that the infection can be contained if actions are taken promptly [32,33].
Based on our media report screening, we did not identify any public quarantine measure
taken by the government in Wuhan before January 23, 2020. Instead, communities were
encouraged to continue hosting large scale gatherings to celebrate the lunar New Year. On
January 18, 2020, over 40 thousand families attended the Ten Thousand Families Banquet at the
Baibuting Community, none of the attendees wore masks. Three days before this event, some
organizers asked to cancel the banquet, but the request was not approved [34]. In the meantime,
the authorities took steps to underreport the incidence and infectivity of COVID-19 to China and
the world.
Emigration and estimation
In this study, we did not incorporate the dynamics of the population in Wuhan. About
five million people left Wuhan before the lockdown, with a large portion happening during the
week before Chinese New Year’s Day (January 25, 2020). The infected among this emigrant
group got in contact with population outside Wuhan, making the susceptible number larger.
Also, the higher frequency of interpersonal contacts of these emigrants before the Chinese New

13

Year’s Day will result in a higher R0. Hence, the estimation of the infected presented in this
paper is likely to be an underestimate.
The start date of the outbreak
In this study, we assumed the outbreak first took place on December 1, 2019. Some
studies suggest an earlier date. However, Ma J reported that according to China’s internal
government’s data, the first case of COVID-19 confirmed case could be traced back to
November 17, 2019 [35]. The Epidemiology Working Group for NCIP Epidemic Response and
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, retrospectively reported 104 cases by
December31, 2019 based on data extracted from China's Infectious Disease Information System
[36]. On September 18, 2019, Chinese media reported a drill by Wuhan Customs, including a
case scenario of “novel coronavirus infection” [37]. The above information suggests possibilities
that are not known to public.
R0 estimation and modeling
The epidemiological parameters are important for estimating the potential impact of the
at least three-weeks delay in response by Chinese government. R0 for Wuhan has been studied by
other groups. Li Q et al. from the Chinese CDC and other institutions studied the Wuhan
epidemic curve up to January 4, 2020, with estimation of R0 as 2.2 [13]. Zhao S et al. applied an
exponential growth model, adjusted report rate of the Chinese official data, and estimated the R0
to be between 2.24 to 3.58 [38]. A study by Sanche S and associates looked into Wuhan travelers
who were confirmed infected in other provinces and estimated the Wuhan outbreak had a R0 of
5.7 (3.8–8.9) [26]. Hou J et al estimated the R0 in Wuhan to be 4.90 during the local epidemic
period from December 1, 2019 to January 9, 2020, and 3.00 during the long-distance spread
14

period due to the Spring Festival travel rush from January 10 to 22 [39]. Read JM et a.l estimated
that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan's early outbreak were identified, and R0 as 3.11 between
January 1 to January 21 [40]. Wu JT et al studied cases exported from Wuhan to other cities
outside of Mainland China using modelling and estimated R0 to be 2.68 [41].
Despite our efforts to extract clinical operation-related data from various types of reports,
the data we have collected are still fragmented and largely incomplete due to the lack of
transparency in China. Nevertheless, our PCR based R0 estimate 3.12 with 95% C.I (2.69, 3.64)
is compatible with the previous studies. As shown in table 5, if the actual R0 is higher than 3.12,
the case reduction brought by intervention will be more significant; if the actual R0 is lower, the
epidemic would have been contained by January 23, 2020.
Wuhan is not a homogenous city, the SEIR model at most can be used to give a crude
oversimplified mathematical modelling of real-life events and estimates of the magnitude of
infection. Given the nature of MCMC methods, the samples/incidences generated in our case
best serve as a rough estimate of the size of the Wuhan epidemic and indicator of discrepancy
from official figures. We thus acknowledge the limitations to the accuracy of our measures.
Conclusion
We investigate the COVID-19 outbreak related clinical operations in Wuhan by drawing
a timeline of the COVID-19 outbreak before lockdown, focusing on “human to human
transmission.” This timeline demonstrates that the Chinese government did not provide critical
information it possessed of human to human transmission for at least three weeks, while
intervening in the case reporting. Without the three-week delay, the largest public health crisis
of this century could have been avoided or controlled to a much greater degree.

Appendix B.
Timeline of COVID-19 Outbreak in Wuhan, before Lockdown on Jan 23, 2020
*Executive Summary*



This timeline attempts to be comprehensive, with the main focus on “human-to-human”
transmission





By January 1, 2020, there had been convincing evidence of “human-to-human”
transmission
On January 20, 2020, Chinese communist party (CCP) government admitted “human-tohuman” transmission including infection of medical staff
Between January 1 and January 20, CCP government had been hiding the epidemic
related information, suppressing the spread of epidemic related information and denying
“human-to-human” transmission



The delay of sharing with the world the true information related to the COVID-19
outbreak in Wuhan, leading to the largest public health and humanity crisis of this
century

3

Classification

A: Category A described how different layers of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
government system use various strategies to hide the truth about Wuhan COVID-19 outbreak,
including all measures and policies to suppress the right moves from the first line medical staff in
Wuhan.

B: Category B described how the front line medical staff and other health care related
professionals reacted and found out about the truth, and how they tried to manage the outbreak
while blowing whistles.

Basically, the “human to human transmission” and “viral genome” are the key clues that we
focus this timeline on.

4

Timeline
September 18, 2019 (09/18/2019)
A: Chinese media reported a drill in Wuhan Customs. One case scenario was a case of patient
with acute respiratory distress in Wuhan Airport, from a flight entering China. The patient was
later diagnosed as “novel coronavirus infection”.
http://k.sina.com.cn/article_2000016880_7735d5f002000krlq.html
11/17/2019

B: According to South China Moring Post, China’s first confirmed Covid-19 case could be
traced back to November 17, 2019. Government records suggest first person infected with new
disease may have been a Hubei resident aged 55, but ‘patient zero’ has yet to be confirmed.
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-chinas-first-confirmedcovid-19-case-traced-back
12/1/2019
B: 1st recorded symptom onset of Wuhan virus patient was on 12/1/2019 from a paper Chinese
medical expert published on <Lancet> with title of <Clinical features of patients infected with
2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China>.
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext
12/12/2019
B. Patient Huang, from the Seafood Wet market, presented to Wuhan Youfu Hospital which is
about 200 meters from the Wet Market. Huang mentioned that seven to eight staff in his
neighbor store got sick, with fever. Huang was concerned about himself. He did not follow
doctor’s suggestion to take a CT.
12/16/2019
B. Seventy years old male, presented to Youfu Hospital, with fever for several days. He took a
chest x-ray which appeared no obvious abnormality.

A：An anonymous person in Sequencing Company reported that he received a phone call from
Wuhan Health Commission on 1/1/2020 that he had to stop testing all samples from Wuhan;
destroy all existing samples; should not disclose information regarding samples to public; should
not publish any research or data based on the samples from Wuhan. He was told to report to the
Health Commission should the company receive any sample in the future.
1/1/2020
A: Wuhan police department announced that Wuhan Health Commission has conveyed
information about Wuhan pneumonia to the general public. However, some people spread
false information online, 8 of them have been summoned and proper actions taken.
1/1/2020
A: The first edition of “Diagnosis and treatment manual for viral pneumonia of unknown
etiology” was proposed and distributed to Wuhan.
1/1/2020
A: WIV conducted the separation of virus from sample(s) provided by Jinyintan Hospital.
1/1/2020
B: BGI group (Huada Gene) reported sequencing results of 3 cases of pneumonia which
harboured a viral sequencing showing 80% similarity to SARS virus to Wuhan City Health
Commission.
1/2/2020
A: Wang Yanyi, Director of Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) emailed all staff to ensure they
can not disclose any information about the new coronavirus.
1/2/2020
A： Dr. Ai Fen, ER chief in Wuhan Central Hospital, was seriously criticized by her superior at
Central hospital for her “making rumors”, she needed to verbally tell all her 200 staff not to
disclose anything about this pneumonia. She was also told she can not use Wechat or text but
only by face to face or phone call. Dr. Ai raised the issue of “human to human transmission” and
she received no response.

12

1/2/2020
Wuhan Central Hospital leadership informed all staff, discussion of “pneumonia of unknown
etiology” was not allowed except at the time of hands-off, any forms of documentation were not
allowed.
1/2/2020
A: Wuhan Institute of Virology finished sequencing on 1/2/2020 of COVID-19, which was
characterized as a “novel” coronavirus, the results were presented to GISAID on 1/11/2020 and
publicized on 2/4/2020.
1/2/2020
A: CCTV13 aired the news that eight people in Wuhan were punished by “making and
spreading rumors”.
1/3/2020:
A: Wuhan police had a meeting with Dr. Li Wenliang regarding his mistake of “spreading
rumors”. (see below Admonition with his finger stamp):
1/3/2020
A: Central hospital administration (president, party secretary and party discipline commission
secretary) criticized division chiefs for wearing masks. Anonymous physician mentioned that
Dr.Li Wenliang was about to be fired by the hospital after he was reprimanded by the hospital
admin. Hospital admin also issued commands verbally such as “can not tell”, “can not wear
masks”. Hospital admin agreed for the ER, respiratory unit and ICU staff to wear N95 masks but
asking other departments not to wear any masks, which lead to massive medical staff infection
due to exposure to virus without protection in central hospital: Up to Feb-11, more than 230
medical staff were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and up to March-09, 4 physicians died,
including Dr. Li Wenliang.
1/3/2020
A: Wuhan Health Commission : So far 44 cases with 11 severe cases. No evidence of “human
to human transmission”, no infection of medical staff.

13

1/3/2020
B: Wuhan reported pneumonia through an “online direct reporting system” for the first time to
Chinese CDC. Chinese CDC former vice chief Yang Gongchuan stated that she asked the
national CDC and confirmed that there was no “direct report” from Wuhan in 2019. Chinese
CDC mentioned receiving a direct report from Wuhan from 1/3/2020 -1/10/2020, but reporting
stopped suddenly till 1/24/2020.
1/3/2020
B: Chinese National Health Commission published 1st protocol for pneumonia with unknown
viral etiology for Wuhan Health Commission to distribute.
1/3/2020
A: Wuhan Health Commission made 2 versions of the protocol with 2 covers. Protocol with
Green cover has 9 files in it while the one with white cover has 10 files. Wuhan Health
Commission distributed protocol with white cover with very strict diagnostic criterias. The green
protocol was given to Chinese National Health Commission but the white protocol was used for
medical practice in Wuhan. The fundamental difference is that “contact with Wuhan seafood wet
market or contact history with suspected patients” is a must for diagnosis in the white protocol
but optional in the green protocol. Following the white protocol will lead to massive
underdiagnosis, under testing and under reporting.
1/3/2020
A: Chinese CDC Institute of Virology finished sequencing the whole genomic sequence for the
novel coronavirus. This sequencing information were kept as secret.
1/3/2020

on 1/3/2020 to prohibit any organization from publishing information about pathogen
detection and test results, asking all organizations to destroy virus samples or transfer to
designated institutions. Any organization of individuals that did not follow this policy will
be legally punished.

1/5/2020
B: Professor Zhang Yongzhen team from Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center detected a
novel SARS like coronavirus and obtained the whole genomic sequence from their samples
obtained on 1/3/2020. Zhang notified Shanghai Health Commission and National Health
Commission to warn them that the new virus is in the same origin with SARS and spread
from the respiratory tract and recommended disease control measures in public.
1/6/2020
A: One physician in the Pulmonary Medicine department has abnormal findings in his
lungs in Wuhan Xinhua hospital. The hospital held an internal meeting which stressed that it

1/9/2020
A: Insider reported to Caixin Media that Zhongnan Hospital public health department submitted
2 pneumonia cases on 1/9/2020 with direct reporting system to Chinese National CDC and
had system confirmation of successful submission. However, they found that the submission
15

on 1/9/2020 was deleted. Wuhan CDC staff confirmed with Caixin Media that the Health
Commission and CDC on district, city and province levels can see submission of cases from
local hospitals in the system but district and city level do not have the authorization to delete
them.
1/9/2020

B: Radiologist, Dr. Li at Wuhan Xinhua hospital identified 3 cases from CT reports with groundglass opacity. Similar cases increase daily with an exponential manner. There were 30 cases on
1/10/2020. Dr. Li believed that situation was severe since he had never seen any virus that grows
this fast and multiplied every few days. Dr.Li stopped believing official reports and contacted his
peers from other radiology departments, the situations are not optimistic across hospitals.
1/11/2020
B Prof. Zhang Yongzhen's team from the lab of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center
published the genetic sequence of COVID-19 to GISAID and used GISAID、
virological.org and GenBank to share with the world at 9am on 1/11/2020. Chinese National
Health Commission announced that China will share the virus genetic sequence with WHO that
evening.
1/11/2020

16

A：Chinese National Health Commission published other 5 genetic sequences from different
patients, those 5 sequences are from Chinese CDC, Chinese medical science institute and Wuhan
Institute of Virology. (Wuhan Institute of Virology confirmed the sequence on 1/2/2020 but
upload on 1/11/2020 to GISAID.)

A: Shanghai Health Commission ordered the lab (Prof. Zhang Yongzhen) in Shanghai Public
Health Clinical Center, who submitted viral genome sequence to GISAIDon 1/11/2020, to close
down and subject to disciplinary actions, as the consequence of violating the “3rd Document”
(or Prohibition on 3rd) issued on 1/3/2020.
1/12/2020
A: Wuhan CCP secretary, Ma Guoqiang stated on CCTV interview on 1/31/2020 that Wuhan
had an increase in pneumonia cases on 1/12 and 1/13. Thus Wuhan started to measure passenger
temperatures at airports and high-speed train stations.
1/12/2020
A: The reporting for pneumonia cannot be submitted without approval from Hubei Health
Commission, thus reporting was artificially stopped from local hospitals for 5 days.
1/14/202
A: Director of Chinese National Health Commission had video conference with provincial
directors.
1/15/2020
A: Chinese National Health Commission held video conferences on prevention and control of the
epidemic. Exposed internal confidential documents (see below link) revealed that the meeting
conveyed five messages: 1). Alarm of the epidemics. 2). Policy is “keep tension internally and
keep a relaxed appearance to public”. 3). Prepare for the epidemic. 4). Ensure the strict
procedure for diagnosis of first case to be followed, i.e., the first case can only be made by the
17

national level and announced by the province level. 5). Reduce the fatality rate since death would
lead to public panic.

infectivity and can be controlled and prevented.
1/19/2020
B： Dr. Li observed in the reading room that “in the beginning there were 2-3 cases daily, 4-5
cases on day 2, 7-8 cases on day 3, there was no obvious growth in the first 3 days. Then it
entered an exponential growth phase, about 30 cases on 1/10 then doubled every 3-4 days, 86
cases on 1/18 then above 100 everyday afterwards.
1/20/2020
