Abstract
We provide a probabilistic SIRD model for the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, where we
allow the infection, recovery and death rates to be random. In particular, the underlying
random factor is driven by a fractional Brownian motion. Our model is simple and needs only
some few parameters to be calibrated.

Introduction

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic many models have been proposed in the literature to
explain its dynamics. Most of these approaches are compartmental models, where the population
is divided into compartments that describe the different situations regarding the infectious disease
(like susceptible, infected, etc.), and people progress between them. The basic reference compartmental model is the SIR model, where the population is divided into susceptible (S), infected (I)
and recovered (R). As this model is too simple to describe the complexity of several epidemics,
some extensions have been proposed in the literature. For example , the SIRD model considers
also the compartment of deaths (D), and the SEIR introduces exposed (E). Some other classical
models, like the SEIRS, also allow to model the lost of immunity after recovery. Some recent approaches pay special attention to non directly observable compartments as asymptomatic (A) (see,
for example, [3] and the references therein) that, even not being directly observable, play a crucial
role in the pandemic. Other extensions consider time-dependent parameters, as in [1], where the
kinetic of the rates of infection (β) and death (µ) are modeled by exponential functions, while the
recovery rate (γ) is of logistic type. Recent literature also exploits stochastic models, where the
main variables account for a noise (Brownian) component, or branching processes [2, 5, 6, 7].
In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic SIRD model, where we allow the coefficients to be
stochastic processes determined by a few number of parameters. This randomness is a way to
accommodate the effect of several unobservable factors, as the loose of immunity or the existence
of asymptomatic. Our construction of the model is motivated by the descriptive analysis of the
parameter time series, where we observe that the β returns have negatively correlated increments,
an observation that suggests to model them by a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with a Hurst
parameter H < 12 [4]. We recall that this approach does not need to consider a drift for β, but this
drift arises simply by the properties of the fBm. Once modeled β, we see that simple relationships
between the evolution of diagnosed and infected, allow us to model γ and µ.
The model is calibrated in such a way the mean paths of infected, death and recovered fit the
corresponding observed values, as well as the variability of β, γ, and µ. Our approach is not only
able to adjust observed data, but also to study the different possible scenarios according to its
stochastic behavior.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present a descriptive analysis of β, γ and µ
corresponding to the evolution of the pandemic in Italy ( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
pcm-dpc/COVID-19/master/dati-andamento-nazionale/dpc-covid19-ita-andamento-nazionale.
csv). Section 3 is devoted to present our stochastic SIRD model for the Italian COVID-19 outbreak. The model is calibrated in Section 4, while we simulate some different scenarios in Section
5. Finally, a discussion of the results and proposals of future research are presented in Section 6.

A descriptive analysis of the SIRD model in the Italian
COVID-19 outbreak

Let us consider a stochastic SIRD model of the form

Sn+1 = Sn − βn In Sn /N



I
n+1 = In (1 + βn Sn /N − γn − µn )

R
n+1 = Rn + γn In



Dn+1 = Dn + µn In ,

(1)

where S, I, R, D = {Sn , In , Rn , Dn , n = 1, ..., 150} denote the number of daily observed susceptible,
infected, recovered and death, N is the population size and β, γ, µ = {βn , γn , µn , n = 1, ..., 150}
2

represent the rates of infection, recovery and death. As S/N ≈ 1 in all the data set, we consider
the following simpler version of the above model


Sn+1 = Sn − βn In

I
n+1 = In (1 + βn − γn − µn )
(2)
Rn+1 = Rn + γIn



Dn+1 = Dn + µIn ,
Now we observe the behavior of this model in Italy in the period from the 24/2/2020 to the
28/7/2020. In Figure 1 we can observe the paths of I (totale positivi in the data set), R (dimessiguariti), D (deceduti) and the total number of diagnosed (I + R + D, totale casi).

Figure 1: Evolution pandemic in Italy.

2.1

The process β

Now let us observe β, γ, µ. In Figure 2 we can see the behavior of β, that is a decreasing function of
time. This fits what expected due to the lock-down, that reduced the number of contacts between
individuals. In Figure 3, we can see the corresponding increments (i.e., ∆β = βn+1 − βn ), that
are more variable at the beginning of the sample, when β is higher.

Figure 3: Increments of β.
Moreover, in Figure 4 we can see the returns ∆β
β that have a stationary mean. After deleting
the outliers at days 115 and 119 (making them equal to zero), the corresponding autocorrelation
function, see Figure 5, reveals a negative correlation between increments. The empirical analysis
suggests to model β as a process with negative correlated increments with a decreasing mean.
This process is designed in Section 3.

2.2

The process µ

The time behavior of µ can be seen in Figure 6. We observe that it is similar to the behavior of
β, but with a delay. Moreover, Figures 7 and 8 show a clear relationship between the daily new
diagnosed and deaths, with a delay of 4 days. 1 In Figure 9, we can see a strong link between total
diagnosed and deaths. In Figures 10 and 11 we can see that this relationship is linear. Then, as
the number of new infected is given by βI, the daily increments of deaths (∆D) would be modeled

simply as cµ βn−4 In−4 , for some positive constant cµ . This leads to the following model for µ:
µn = cµ βn−4 In−4 /In ,

The process γ

Finally, let us observe the path of γ in Figure 12. This recovery rate seems to move between an
upper and a lower bound, that we can interpret as the rate under stressed conditions of the health
system, and the rate when this system adapts to the new scenario and the epidemic curve decays.
This is connected to the approach in [1], where γ is assumed to be described by a logistic function,
and the rate of recovery increases from a initial value γ0 and it stabilizes at some higher level.

Figure 12: Evolution of γ.
A measure of the stress of the model can be defined as the quantity
(I + R + D)−30n /(I + R + D)n ,

(3)

where (I + R + D)−30n is the average of the diagnosed people the last 30 days. If there are no
new infections, the number of diagnosed remains stable, and then the above quantity is near 1.
Otherwise, a high increment of new cases translates into a decrease of the value of this ratio. In
Figure 13, we can see the behavior of this process

Figure 13: (I + R + D)−30n /(I + R + D)n
We can also observe in Figure 12 a big variance, as expected due to the fact that not everybody
recovers at the same speed. Then we would like to add some noise, multiplying this time series
by an adequate random factor, as we detail in the following section.

A stochastic SIRD model

We propose a stochastic SIRD model where randomness is embedded by modeling the parameters
of infection (β), mortality (µ) and recovery (γ). In the following subsections, we will describe the
model for each one of the parameters.

3.1

A stochastic model for β.

As the return of β are negatively correlated, it is natural to construct a model based on the
fractional Brownian motion (fBm). The fBm is a Gaussian process with stationary increments,
which depends on a parameter H ∈ (0, 1) called the Hurst parameter. More precisely, a process
B H = BtH , t ∈ [0, T ] is called a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) if
• E(B0H ) = 0.
• E(BtH BsH ) = 21 (s2H + t2H − |t − s|2H ).
Except in the Brownian motion case H = 1/2, the fBm increments are correlated. Denote Xn =
H
BnH − Bn−1
and define ρH (n) := Cov(X1 , Xn+1 ). Then we have
ρH (n)

H
= E(B1H (Bn+1
− BnH ))
1 2H
(1 + (n + 1)2H − n2H )
=

− (12H + n2H − (n − 1)2H )



=
(n + 1)2H + (n − 1)2H − 2n2H

Notice that this quantity is positive for H >

(4)

and negative if H < 12 .

Then, a natural candidate to model β is given by
H
β̂n+1 = β̂n (1 + (Bn+1
− BnH )),

(5)

where B H is a fractional Brownian motion with H < 12 and k is a constant. Apart from the
negative correlated returns, this process has also a decreasing mean, as we prove in the following
result.
Proposition 3.1. Consider a fractional Brownian motion B H with H <
by (8). Then, provided β0 > 0, E(β̂n ) is decreasing as n → ∞.

and the process defined

Proof. A recursive computation gives us that
β̂n := β̂0 An ,
with

An := Πnm=1 (1 + k∆Bm
),

where ∆Bm

(7)
where we have used that partitions Pi exist only if i is even. Then, as k i is positive for all even i
and all the ρH (|mj − mk |) are strictly negative, E(An ) is decreasing. This allows us to complete
the proof.
Even when the model (8) reproduces some empirical properties of β, a numerical analysis shows
that it has to be modified before being an adequate model. More precisely, we can see in Figure
14 that the variability of the paths is high, and that the process β̂ can even become negative (see
also Figure 15). Moreover, the estimated correlation between two consecutive increments of β̂
does not coincide with the observed for the β returns.

Figure 14: 10 possible paths of β̂ for H = 0.1.
A way to reduce the variance of the paths is obviously to define a model of the type
βn+1 =

where β i , i = 1, .., m are given by
i,H

βn+1
= βni (1 + ciβ (Bn+1
− Bni,H )),

being B i,H , i = 1, ..., m m independent fractional Brownian motions with Hurst parameter H < 21
and where ciβ , i = 1, ..., n are positive constant. The interpretation of (8) is intuitive: the observed
11

process β is really the sum of different stochastic β i that correspond to the particular transmission
rates in different groups, locations, etc. In Figures 15 and 16we can observe, for H = 0.1, the
behavior of the cases m = 1 (where the volatility is too big), and m = 10, where the area delimited
by the the maximum and minimum paths contain the observed values of β.

Figure 15: Maximum and minimum of the simulated paths of β̂.

Figure 16: Maximum and minimum of the simulated paths of β and m = 10.

3.2

A stochastic model for µ and γ.

As pointed out in 2, the linear relationship between diagnosed (with 4 days lag) and death, suggests
modeling µ simply as
µn = cµ βn−4 In−4 /In .

12

On the other hand, the observations in Section 2 lead to a model for γ of the type
H

γ
γn = c1γ [(I + R + D)−30n /(I + R + D)n ] exp(c2γ (Bn+1
− BnHγ )),

for some positive constants c1γ , c2γ and for some adequate Hurst parameter Hγ .

Notice that only 7 parameters have to be calibrated are m, H, Hγ and cβ , cµ ,c1γ , c2γ . We see in
the following section how the set of the first three parameters m, H, Hγ , that define the driving
processes of the model, is chosen based on empirical observations, while the last group is calibrated
by means of a classical least squares method.

Calibration

4.1

The steps of the calibration process

The calibration procedure is as follows.
• In a first step, we fix reasonable values of m and the Hurst parameters according to observed
data, and
• fixed m, H, and Hγ , we calibrate cβ , cµ ,c1γ , c2γ by a least squares method.
Step 1 focuses on choosing adequate driving random processes for the model. As estimating with
precision and robustness this group of parameters is not straightforward (see for example Glotter
(2007)), so we simply proceed empirically. More precisely, we have seen in Section 2 that the
maximum and the minimum paths in the case H = 0.1 and m = 10 envelope the observed β time
series. Moreover, the observed correlation of beta returns (for lag=1) is equal to −0.347, while
(from a 1000 simulations sample), we estimate this quantity to be −0.314 for H = 0.1 and m = 10.
This leads to choose m = 10, H = 0.1 in our model.
In order to choose Hγ , we compute the autocorrelation function of


γn
log
.
[(I + R + D)−30n /(I + R + D)n ]
At lag=1, this autocorrelation function is equal to 0.244. Then, taking into account Equation (4),
we get a estimation of Hγ = 0.657. Then we choose Hγ = 0.6 for the sake of simplicity.

4.2

Initial guess for cβ , cµ , c1γ , c2γ and global calibration

In order to be able to start the calibration of the other parameters, we will need to have an initial
guess.

13

To find the parameter cβ , we are going to fit the average β̂ against the realized β. This gives
us a value of 0.32250809.
For µ, as we have seen previously, we can obtain a nice estimation by doing a linear regression
between the infected and death people. The slope ( 0.13904755) will be the initial guess for cµ .
In the case of γ, in order to obtain the variables c1γ , c2γ , we minimize the distance between
the average γ̂ and the observed γ, as well as the distance between the standard deviation of the
returns of γ̂ and the observed γ. This gives us (0.03512639,0.5) as initial guess.
Once we have the initial guess, we find the best possible parameters to minimize the distance
between the infected, the death and the recovered time series as well as the empirical variance of
the γ by OLS.

5

Results

Following the procedure in the previous section, we get the following estimation of the parameters
of the model:
cβ = 0.32102563, cµ = 0.13981687, c1γ = 0.03383898, c2γ = 0.54395798.

Discussion

In the present work, we have extended the classic SIRD model including stochastic parameters
and we obtain an easy-to-calibrate pure probabilistic model. We have been able to reproduce the
evolution of the parameters of the Italian outbreak using only seven parameters. The properties
of the fractional Brownian motion and the relationship between the parameters of the model are
able to reproduce the exponential and logistic trends observed for example in [1]. Therefore, we
have been able to fit the empirical data as well as imitate the noise of the variables. One of the
advantages of having a stochastic model is that we are capable of generating a wide variety of
scenarios.
One challenging problem is now to model the evolution after a lockdown. This translates into
a new dynamics of β, probably driven by a fBm with H > 12 . Moreover, the comparison between
different countries that applied different policies during the pandemic would be of great interest.
