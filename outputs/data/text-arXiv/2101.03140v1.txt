Abstract. COVID-19 hits the world like a storm by arising pandemic
situations for most of the countries around the world. The whole world is
trying to overcome this pandemic situation. A better health care quality
may help a country to tackle the pandemic. Making clusters of countries with similar types of health care quality provides an insight into
the quality of health care in different countries. In the area of machine
learning and data science, the K-means clustering algorithm is typically
used to create clusters based on similarity. In this paper, we propose an
efficient K-means clustering method that determines the initial centroids
of the clusters efficiently. Based on this proposed method, we have determined health care quality clusters of countries utilizing the COVID-19
datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method reduces
the number of iterations and execution time to analyze COVID-19 while
comparing with the traditional k-means clustering algorithm.

Introduction

COVID-19 was detected near the end of 2019 from the Chinese city of Wuhan
[1]. The virus spread rapidly by transmission throughout the whole world within
a short period of time. The World Health Organization (WHO) had to declare
COVID-19 pandemic. To eradicate the pandemic situation, different countries
have taken initiatives to remold their health care quality. Clustering the countries
with similar types of health care quality helps us to know about the health care
quality comparing with the rest of the counties.
In the area of machine learning and data science, both supervised learning
and unsupervised learning are popular to solve various kinds of real world problems [2] [3]. In the case of clustering, unsupervised machine learning algorithms
are being used [4] [5]. The unsupervised machine learning algorithm typically
identifies insight structures of the data from unlabelled data contained in the

2

Zubair et al.

dataset. The clustering algorithm finds and divides the data points according to
the similarity of the hidden structures of the dataset [6]. K-Means [5] clustering
is one of the most important and widely used unsupervised machine learning
algorithms as it is widely used to identify the hidden structure automatically.
The algorithm is used to find the number of clusters so that it is possible
to divide the unlabelled dataset into subgroups. It is done by calculating the
distances from a centroid of a cluster. K-means algorithm is an NP-Hard problem
[7]. Efficiently estimating the initial centroids is a difficult problem. At the initial
state, we need to fix the coordinates of the initial centroid for finding the number
of clusters. In the traditional K-Means clustering algorithm, initial centroids
usually being selected randomly. Thus, determining the initial coordinate points
of centroids can play a signifcant role in clustering, in which we are interested
in. The key contributions of our work are as follows • Our proposed method efficiently selects the k-means clustering algorithm’s
centroids that provides an optimum number of constant iteration as well as
execution time.
• We have clustered similar types of countries according to the health care
quality during the COVID-19 pandemic.
• We have tested our model with a COVID-19 real-world dataset to show the
efficiency of our model with the existing models.
In the following, several related works have been discussed in Section 2. We
present our proposed methodology in Section 3. In Section 4, we have shown the
experimental results and comparative analysis. In Section 5 we highlight some
key points and concludes this paper.

Related Work

Several approaches have been proposed to find the initial cluster centroids more
efficiently. In this section, we bring some of these works. M. S. Rahman et al. [8],
provides a centroids selection method based on radial and angular coordinates.
However, the number of iterations of his proposed idea is not constant for all
the instances. Also, the execution time of that method increases drastically by
the increase of the cluster number. A. Kumar et al. also proposed to find initial
centroids based on the dissimilarity tree [9]. Although this method improves kmeans clustering, the execution time is not exalted significantly. Also, the smaller
datasets that are used for experiment results can not provide insight into a large
dataset. In [10], M.S. Mahmud et al. proposed a novel approach to find the initial
centroids by calculating the mean of each distance of the data points. It only
describes 3 clusters of given three datasets with the execution time. Improvement
of execution time is also trivial. The concept is based on the weighted average.
In [11], another approach is made to find the initial centroids efficiently. Here in
M. Goyal et al. also tried to find the centroids by dividing the sorted distances
with k, the number of equal partitions. No execution time was given for this
proposed method. S. Na et al. [12] have proposed the use of two elementary
data structures to store cluster labels and the distance of all data items with

An Efficient K-means Clustering Algorithm for Analysing COVID-19

each iteration. On the next iteration, data of the previous iteration was used.
But, execution time was trivial for the dataset experimented by authors. M. A.
Lakshmi et al. [13] have proposed a method to find initial centroids by using the
nearest neighbor method. They compared their idea by using SSE(Sum of the
Squared Differences) with random and kmeans++ initial selection. Their SSE is
roughly similar to random and kmeans++ initial selection. Moreover, They did
not provide any comparison concerning execution time as well.
S. R. Vadyala et al. proposed a combined algorithm with k-means and LSTM
to predict the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 [14]. LSTM is abbreviated
as long short-term memory, an artificial recurrent neural network architecture
used for Deep learning. In [15], author A. Poompaavai et al. attempted to identify the affected areas by COVID-19 of India by using the k-means clustering
algorithm. Many approaches related to COVID-19 problem, k-means clustering
has been used. In [16], S.K. Sonbhadra et al. proposed a novel bottom-up approach for COVID-19 articles using k-means clustering along with DBSCAN and
HAC.

Proposed Methodology

In this section, we present our k-means clustering-based COVID-19 analysis to
determine the clusters according to the health care quality of the countries. The
result of the k-means clustering is effected on the selection or assignment of initial
centroids [17]. So, it is necessary to select the centroids more systematically to
improve the performance of the k-means clustering algorithm, also the execution
time. In our approach, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [18] while
determining the centroids.
The following flowchart in Figure 1 depicts the overall process of our proposed
method. Our proposed method can determine the coordinates of initial centroids
which can obtain the coordinates more precisely than the existing methods.

3.1

Input Dataset

Many machine learning algorithms, including both supervised and unsupervised
methods have been applied to the COVID-19 dataset [15]. Each attribute of the
dataset must contain numerical values for approaching the k-means algorithm
[5]. If not then, some pre-processing might be required for handling missing

4

Zubair et al.

values and non-numeric values. Before going to further methodology, it needs to
be ensured that each attributes values in numeric.
For creating our model, we have used a few datasets for selecting the features, required for analyzing the health care quality of the countries. The selected
datasets are owid-covid-data [19], covid-19-testing-policy [20], public-events-covid
[20], covid-containment-and-health-index [20], inform-covid-indicators[21]. It is
worth mentioning that we used the data up to 11st August 2020. For instance,
some of the attributes of the owid-covid-data [19] are shown in Table 1. CovidTable 1. Sample data of COVID-19 dataset

Other datasets also contains such types of features which is required for
ensuring the health care quality of a country. These real-world datasets help us
to analyze our proposed method for real-world scenarios.

3.2

Principal Component Analysis and Percentile

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a method, that utilizes an orthogonal
transformation to translate a set of observations of potentially correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables that are called principal components. PCA is widely used in data analysis and for making a predictive
model considering dimensionality reduction [22] [18], that has been taken into
account in our approach.
On the other hand, the percentile method [23] used in our model divides
the whole dataset into 100 different parts. Each part contains 1 percent data of
the total dataset. For example, the 25th percentile means this part contains 25
percent data of the total dataset. That implies, using the percentile method, we
can split our dataset into different distributions according to our given values.

The percentile formula is given below [23]:
R=

ρ
100

∗ (η + 1)

Here, ρ = The Percentile wants to find, η = Total Number of values, R =
Percentile at ρ.
3.3

Dataset Split and Mean Calculation

After splitting the reduced dimensional dataset through percentile, we then extract the split data from the primary dataset by indexing for each percentile.
In this process, we get back the original data. After retrieving the original data
for each percentile, we have calculated the mean of each attribute. These means
from the split dataset is the initial centroids of our proposed method.
3.4

Centroids Determination

After splitting the dataset and calculating the mean according to the subsection 3.3, we have selected the means of each split dataset as a centroid. These
centroids are taken into account as initial centroids for the efficient k-means
clustering algorithm.
3.5

Cluster Generation

At the last step, we have executed our modified k-means algorithm until the centroids converge. Passing our proposed centroids instead of random or kmeans++
centroids through the k-means algorithm we have generated the final clusters
[24]. The proposed method always considers the same centroids for each test.
The pseudocode of our whole proposed methodology is given in the algorithm
1. In the next section, evaluation and experimental results are discussed.

Implementation and Experimental Results Analysis

To measure the effectiveness and validate our proposed model for selecting the
optimum initial centroids for the k-means clustering algorithm, we have implemented and showed experimental results with real-world dataset. We have used
five COVID-19 datasets and merged them to have a handful of features for clustering the countries according to their health quality during COVID-19.
4.1 Datasets Pre-processing
We have merged the datasets described in subsection 3.1 according to the country
name. With the regular expression, some pre-processing and data cleaning have
been conducted in the case of merging the data. We have also handled some
missing data consciously. There are so many attributes regarding COVID-19,

among them 25 attributes had been selected finally, as these attributes closely
signify the health care quality of a country. The attributes represent categorical
and numerical values. These are country name, cancellation of public events
(due to public health awareness), stringency index1 , testing policy ( category of
testing facility available to the mass people), total positive case per million, new
cases per million, total death per million, new deaths per million, cardiovascular
death rate, hospital beds available per thousand, life expectancy, inform the
COVID-19 risk (rate), hazard and exposure dimension rate, people using at
least basic sanitation services (rate), inform vulnerability(rate), inform health
conditions (rate), inform epidemic vulnerability (rate), mortality rate, prevalence
of undernourishment, lack of coping capacity, access to healthcare, physicians
density, current health expenditure per capita, maternal mortality ratio. All of
the attributes are closely investigated before feeding the model.
As we are going to make clusters for the countries with similar types of
healthcare quality, the optimum number of clusters is 4, defined by the elbow
method [26].
4.2

Centroids of COVID-19 Dataset

We have applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to convert a high dimensional dataset into two dimensions. The number of clusters is 4 for the
COVID-19 dataset. After applying PCA, we have used percentile concepts to
divide the whole dataset into K equal parts. For K=4, each portion contains
25% of the dataset. For this purpose, we have calculated the percentile for 25%,
50%, 75%, and 99.9% data. We have divided the data horizontally because it

provides a good intuition to the cluster. Figure 2 depicts plotting the data with
two dimensional PCA where horizontal lines represents the splitting according
to percentile.

Fig. 2. PCA with Percentile on COVID-19 Dataset

As described in subsection 3.3, after splitting the dataset and mean calculation we have got the proposed initial centroids of k-means. Efficient centroids
of COVID-19 for 4 centroids are given in table 3. Here only 7 attributes from
25 attributes are shown for demonstration purposes. In table 3, c1,c2,c3 and c4
represent initial clusters centroids consecutively.

Evaluation Process

In machine learning and data science, computational power is one of the main
issues. Because at a time, a computer needs to process a large amount of data.
So, reducing computational cost is a big deal. As discussed in the methodology
in section 3, we implemented our proposed method. Though many researchers
proposed many ideas those are discussed in the related work section. We have
compared our method with the best existing kmeans++ method [24]. We have
measured the effectiveness of the model with
• Number of iterations needed for finding the final clusters

• Execution time for reaching out to the final clusters
These two things are compared in the upcoming subsections.

Efficiency analysis

In figure 3, we show the experimental result of the COVID-19 dataset for 10
tests. In the graph, the green and the red line represents results for the proposed
and kmeans++ algorithms consecutively. As our centroid is pre-defined, the
number of iterations is constant in every test case. On the contrary, kmeans++
method works with random iterations. For getting insight into the clusters, we
have plotted the cluster map in Figure 4 showing similar types of countries in
terms of health care quality. The 2D plot also shows the cluster distributions
in a two-dimensional space. Before jumping to the demonstration, it is worth
mentioning that the model have been tested on the Intel® CoreTM i7-8750H
processor.

• Figure 3(a) provides the iteration comparison for existing kmeans++ and our
proposed method. When our proposed method have been applied, we find
a constant number of iterations in each test. But the existing kmeans++
method’s iteration is random. It might be varied for different test cases.
• Figure 3(b) provides the execution time comparison for existing kmeans++
and our proposed method. For each test case, our model have executed the
k-means clustering algorithm with the shortest time.
Based on the experimental results, we claim that our model outperforms in the
case of real-world application and reduces the computational power for the kmean clustering algorithm.

Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we have presented an efficient clustering method that selects the
optimal initial centroids of K-means clustering algorithm. With the help of the
proposed method, we have efficiently created the clusters of different countries
according to similar health care quality during COVID-19. While experimenting
with COVID-19 datasets, our model outperforms in terms of a reduced number
of constant iterations, that consequently reduces the execution times as well.
Although our proposed model outperforms for real-world scenarios, it might be
a little bit diverged if the number of instances of the dataset are high or extremely
high. In the future, we have a plan to work on a huge number of instances and
build an effective recommendation system.
