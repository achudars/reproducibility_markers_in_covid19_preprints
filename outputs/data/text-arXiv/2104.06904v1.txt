In October of 2020, China announced that it aims to start reducing its carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 1,2. The surprise
announcement came in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic which caused a transient
drop in China’s emissions in the first half of 2020 3. Here, we show an unprecedented decarbonization of China’s power system in late 2020: although China’s power related
carbon emissions were 0.5% higher in 2020 than 2019, the majority (92.9%) of the
increased power demand was met by increases in low-carbon (renewables and nuclear)
generation (+9.3%), as compared to only +0.4% for fossil fuels. China’s low-carbon
generation in the country grew in the second half of 2020, supplying a record high of 36.7%
(+1.9% compared to 2019) of total electricity in 2020, when the fossil production dropped
to a historical low of 63.3%. Combined, the carbon intensity of China’s power sector
decreased to an historical low of 519.9 tCO 2-eqGWh-1 in 2020. If the fast decarbonization
and slowed down power demand growth from 2019 to 2020 were to continue, by 2030,
over half (50.8%) of China’s power demand could be provided by low carbon sources.
Our results thus reveal that China made progress towards its carbon neutrality target
during the pandemic, and suggest the potential for substantial further decarbonization in
the next few years if the latest trends persist. [228 words]
China’s power system is a major source of the country’s energy-related carbon emissions3-6,
accounting for roughly half of it’s overall emissions, and 14% global energy-related emissions4.
Lockdown measures applied during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic (for example, promoting
remote working and studying, closing down non-essential business) have dramatically changed
power demand dynamics and reduced power related emissions 3,7. Restrictions of in-person and
commercial activities with reduced supply and consumers demand caused a 5.4% decrease of
Chinese carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the first half of 20203. These impacts were however
short-living, as rebound in electricity demand and CO2 emissions, especially from the industry
sector3 was observed with the relaxation of restrictions.
In October 2020, for the first time, China announced its goal to reduce emissions before 2030
and to pursue a follow-up effort to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, as strong efforts to meet
the climate targets of the Paris Agreement, which calls for rapid and drastic reductions of global
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Yet China’s electricity system still relies heavily on fossil
fuels (e.g., coal supplied 75% of all electricity in 2019), and substantial emissions reductions
in this sector will thus need to overcome the lock-in of fossil infrastructure and scale-up
deployment of low-carbon energy technologies8,9. Specifically, renewables (including hydroelectricity, solar power, wind power, geothermal power, biomass and other renewable sources)
and nuclear energy will need to take up the share of coal in the energy mix as a long-term plan,
to meet the energy demand while phasing out coal consumption. Several studies have analysed
the decarbonization potential in China’s power system, as to which extend and under which
scenarios low carbon energy sources could replace the current share of fossil fuels as energy
sources6,10,11. Scenarios based on historical developments prior to 2020 show that China needed
to promote clean energy and to control coal-fired power, in order to peak the emissions earlier12.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new uncertainties and opportunities. The
dramatically declined in power related emissions were closely linked to reduction in fossil-fired
power13. The ongoing economic recovery and decisions about stimulus related to the pandemic
will have a powerful influence on emissions due to short-term changes in consumption but also
in the longer-term if these decisions are accompanied by changes in long-lived energy
infrastructure.
According to China’s Electricity Council, China’s total power demand growth was above 3%
in 2020 as compared to 2019 (https://cec.org.cn). This indicates that the temporal reduced
power demand has quickly recovered. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptive changes
in everyday life for extended time period, but only led to limited reduction in carbon emissions,
so far the long-term impacts on energy structure change (especially for renewables and nuclear
energy) during and after the pandemic, and the driving factors behind changes have not been
systematically evaluated.
Here, we constructed China’s near-real-time carbon emission dataset with daily temporal
resolution, covering source-specific power generation and sector-specific power consumption
and their related emissions (See Methods). On the base of this newly constricted near-real-time
power generation and related emission profiles from fossil (coal, natural-gas and oil /petroleum)
and low carbon energy sources, we evaluate the short- and long-term impact of COVID-19 on
the energy structure and power related emissions (nuclear power, hydro power, solar power,
wind power, geothermal, biomass burning, waste burning and other renewables). We assess the
climate impacts of changes in the electricity system by assess life-cycle GHG emissions with
source-specific emission factors (see Methods). These emission factors account for direct fossil
fuel CO2 emissions and indirect emissions from construction, operation, land-use change,
upstream and biogenic CH4 emissions14,15. The driving factors behind power related emissions
are evaluated by decomposing changes in energy structure and electricity demand from each of
four main economic sectors (primary i.e. agriculture, secondary i.e. industry, tertiary i.e. service,
and residential sector), which can be further disaggregated into 12 sub-categories. To separate
the temporary impacts of climatic factors from other activity related impacts (such as the
COVID-19 and infrastructure expanding), temperature and resource availabilities are analysed
using satellite re-analysis data. In the end, we synthesis the abovementioned information to
evaluate the long-term impact on China’s power system and its associated emissions in the postCOVID era with scenario analysis. Details of our analytic approach, accounting methods and
assumptions are described in Methods with the methodology developed previously13,16.
Dynamics in China’s power generation and greenhouse gas emissions in 2020
We found that although the year-end data show that generation increased by 253.3 TWh
(+3.5%) in 2020, such rebound is with significant decreases in carbon intensity and fossil power
share (Fig. 1). Figure 1b shows daily and cumulative changes in emissions. In total, the power
sector produced 419.4 MtCO2-eq GHG emission in 2020, an 18.64 MtCO2-eq increase (+0.5%)

from 2019. The increased demand for electricity in 2020 was mainly met by a surprising
increase in low-carbon (non-fossil) generation, which increased by 235.0 TWh (+9.3%) from
2019—thus accounting for 92.8% of the increase in demand (Fig. 1a). In comparison, fossil
power increased by just 18.3 TWh (+0.4%). The combined effect on the carbon intensity of
China’s power sector was a decrease to an historical low of 519.9 tCO 2GWh-1 (averaged over
2020), along with the lowest share of thermal production (63.3%) and highest share of lowcarbon electricity (36.7%) in the country’s history (Fig. 1d, historical development see SI Fig.1a,
b).
As the country where COVID-19 cases first emerged17, there was a sudden decline in
electricity generation and related emissions (Figs. 1a, 1b, and 1c; Fig. 2). However, Low-carbon
electricity declined by only 4.1 TWh (-88.1GWhd-1 or -0.9%, as compared to 3.9% pre-COVID
growth in 2020), much less affected by COVID-related restrictions in contrast to fossil
electricity (dropping by 109.4 TWh, -2.3 TWhd-1 or -11.4%, as compared to -6.4% pre-COVID
decline in 2020). As a result, power related emissions declined by 11.6% during the COVID19 pandemic (-116.1 MtCO2-eq) as compared to 2019.

figures. The Chinese New Year holidays of 2020 and of 2019 are indicated by orange and turquoise
shades, respectively. The Chinese National Day (1st Oct) holiday (“Golden Week”) is shaded in light
purple.

Under the impact of COVID-19 (from January to March), decreased power demand account
for 64% of the declined emission and improved energy (declined energy intensity, also see Fig.
1c) accounted for the rest 36% (Fig. 1b). Consumption reduction was observed for all sectors
except for the urban and rural residential sectors (increased by 9.5 TWh or 3.4%). The biggest
consumption decline is in the Secondary sector of economy (i.e. mainly industry) and the
Tertiary sector (i.e. service), with 23.5 TWh (-8.2%) reduction in power demand (Fig. 1e).
Power demand rebounded steadily in the post-COVID time (since April, Fig 1.e), but its
impact on emissions were offset by the continuously improving energy structure (shown by
declined carbon intensity and increased share of low carbon power in energy mix in Fig. 1c).
until the last days in December (Fig. 1c). By the end of 2020, Primary, Secondary, Tertiary
sector and Urban and Rural Residential increased by 10.2%, 3.7%, 1.5% and 6.7% increase in
power consumption, respectively. The only two sub-sectors of which the power demand did not
recover to the 2019 level were Consumption goods manufacturing and other non-industrial
secondary sector (declined by -2.3% and -5.1%, respectively, SI Fig. 4a). Contrary to the overall
power demand increase (>1% for all main and sub-sectors), sector-wise carbon emission in the
post-COVID recovery period stayed negative or remained comparable to 2019 for most subsectors, as a result of improved energy structure (SI Fig. 4b). Primary sector, Secondary sector
and Urban and Rural Residential showed 7.0%, 0.9%, and 2.8% year-end increase, respectively,
while Tertiary sector showed 1.4% year-end decrease in power related carbon emissions. In
total, power associated emission increased by 4.1% in the post-COVID time as compared to
2019.

Reduction of coal-fired power coincided with the pandemic
More importantly, we show that COVID-19 lock-down further accelerated the reduction of
coal from fossil power (Fig. 2 show daily variation with 2019 as baseline; SI Fig. 2 provide
daily variation with 2016-2019 as baseline). Coal-fired power declined at an average rate of 1.4 TWhd-1 during the lockdown (as compared to -1.1 TWhd-1 decline prior to COVID-19 lock-

down), to 15.4% below its 2016-2019 average and beyond its 2016-2019 variations (as
compared to 0.6% above its 2016-2019 average prior to COVID-19 lockdown, SI Fig. 2).
Nuclear power also showed decline coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic (by -19.7 GWhd1

and declined to 2.8% below its 2019 level but within its 2016-2019 variations, SI Fig. 2e).

Hydro-electricity on average declined by -333.8 GWhd-1 as compared to 2019 but stayed at the
same level as 2016-2019 average (SI Fig. 2f) with no clear time correlation with the COVID19 pandemic (Fig. 2h). Wind power, solar power, other renewables increased by 126.3 GWhd 1

, 103.6 GWhd-1 and 86.2 GWhd-1, respectively (Fig. 2e, 2f, and 2i, also above past five-year

average and 95% confidence interval, see SI Fig. 2). In summary, the COVID-19 lock-down
led to an immediate but short-term decline in coal and nuclear power, while gas-fired power,
wind power, solar power and other renewables continued their increase.
In China’s post-COVID recovery phase in 2020 (from the ease of Wuhan lockdown as of 8 th
April, till the end of 2020), low carbon power continued its steady increase with 847.5 GWhd1 (11.6%), and accounted for 62.4% of the increased power demand (1.4 TWhd -1, 6.7%, with 0.3% decline linked to temperature change). Power generation from every source showed net
growth in post-COVID recovery, with coal power (448.3 GWhd -1) and hydro-electricity (402.1
GWhd-1) and the main contributor, followed by smaller but substantial growth in wind power
(176.6 GWhd-1) other renewables (106.3 GWhd -1) and solar power (105.1 GWhd -1). Nuclear
power grew by 57.4 GWhd-1, ranks as the smallest among low carbon power. The smallest
growth is observed in gas (40.8 GWhd -1) and oil (21.0 GWhd-1). With the recovery, coal power
resumed to the same level as the past four-year average, while all other power sources achieved
growth that is above the past five-year average and 95% confidence intervals (SI Fig.2 c-i).
Combined, our calculation show there was rapid decarbonization and emission decrease in
the power system during the COVID-19 lockdown, although the declined emission was largely
offset by the demand increase in the post-COVID recovery, the decarbonization trend
maintained as low carbon power grew steadily and strongly. The share of coal-fired power
declined by 3.2% as compared to 2019 (also declined by 7.4% as compared to 2016-2019
average). Share of low carbon power increased by 2.5% to 34.3% as compared to 2019 (also
increased by 6.7% as compared to 2016-2019 average). Emission declined by 12.2% as
compared to 2019 (but increased by 6.3% as compared to 2016-2019 average). By the end of
2020, the share of coal-fired power still declined by 2.1% as compared to 2019 (also by 6.0%
as compared to 2016-2019 average. Share of low carbon power increased by 1.9% as compared
to 2019 (also by 5.7% as compared to 2016-2019 average).
Scenarios of Emission from China’s power system
Total life-cycle GHG emissions from eight energy sources are considered, with emissions
from 2010 to the present, and projections to 2030 under various power demand and generation
scenarios (Fig. 3 and over all year-over-year power generation dynamics from January, 2010 to
December, 2019 see SI Fig5). For every month of the year from 2010 to 2019, China’s total
power demand, and source-specific power generations have followed strict near-linear growths

for the past decade, as guided by the growth goals outlined in the “Five Year Plans” (the twelfth
and the thirteenth). Total power demand shows the highest linearity (R2 > 0.97 for every month).
Nuclear power, wind power and solar also show very strong linearity in its year-over-year
generation growth (R2 > 0.9 for every month), following by fossil-fired power (from coal, gas
and oil) and by power from other renewables (R 2 between 0.84 ~0.95). The growth of hydro
power generation shows strong linearity in spring, summer and winter time (R 2 between
0.88~0.95), but less strong for the three months in autumn (R2 = 0.81, 0.69, 0.84, respectively).
Given the fact that the power generation have followed strict near-linear growths for the past
decade under the “Five Year Plans”（Fig. 3）, we can make a straightforward comparison to
show the impacts on China’s power demand and generation from the pandemic. We compare
the impacts of COVID-19 on China’s power system’s energy structure and its related emissions
for the next 10 years (from 2020 to 2030), by defining three scenarios of different power
demand and policy directions. These scenarios are: First, baseline (BS) scenario, which assumes
the continuation of the most recent development plan (the recently completed “13th Five Year
Plan” for year 2015-2020) in fossil and low carbon power development for year 2020-2030.
The BS scenario is constructed with 2019 as baseline, also referred to as “Scenario without
COVID-19”. Second, improved energy structure (IES) scenario, assumes the power demand
will continue as before 2020 but the above-usual year-over-year fast expanding of low carbon
power in 2020 will continue for 2020-2030. Third, reduced demand with decarbonization (RD),
which assumes both the constrains of the power demand growth and the year-over-year fast
expanding of low carbon power in 2020 will continue for 2020-2030. The baseline year of both
IES and RD scenarios is 2020. Key assumptions are summarized in Table 1.
We acknowledged the limits and uncertainties of the scenarios, as previous studies suggested
different predictions on the peak of China’s energy demand ranging from 2025, 2030, 2035 or
beyond10,18-20. However, according to China’s Electricity Council, there is still projection of
power demand growth from 2020 – 2035. Thus, a near-term scenario comparison based on the
most recent plan and status of China’s demand and generation give us insights on the potential
for substantial further decarbonization in the next few years if the latest trends persist. In
addition, power demand outlook and efficiency improvements in the BS scenario are consistent
with trends in previous ‘market-based’ predictions, which assumed that current policies
continuate and future renewable costs decreases moderately6,10. The structure outlook under the
BS scenario is also very similar to other predictions assuming a continuation of current policies
and developments. For example, the BS scenario predicts that China’s renewables will increase
by 1596 TWh by 2030, while IEA predicts an increase of 1 500 TWh21.
Under the impact of COVID-19, the year-over-year growth of China’s 2020 total power
demand was below its previous growth rates (Fig. 4). The demand reduction was
disproportionally reflected in coal-fired power, while low carbon power remained its high
growth rate, resulted in a decarbonized power system as compared to its own past. Though
China’s power system is still heavily relying on coal as major power source, the recent “14th
Five Year Plan” outlines the importance of limiting coal-fired power as crucial pathway to

achieve carbon neutrality by 20606.
Under all three scenarios, China’s total power demand will continue to grow at different rates
(SI Fig 5), as well as its total power related GHG emissions (Fig. 4). Under the BS scenario,
China’s power related GHG emissions are yet to growth by 30.3% in 2030 (as compared to
2020, Fig. 3a, b), with carbon intensity reduced to 474.9 tCO 2eq/GWh (as compared to 525.3
tCO2eq/GWh in 2020 under BS scenario, and 519.9 tCO2eq/GWh based on actual data from
2020, Fig. 3d). While RD scenario predicts a small growth in power related emission (4.7% as
compared to 2020), carbon intensity will also reduce to 407.5 tCO 2eq/GWh (21.6% decline as
compared to 2020, Fig. 3c). In comparison, the increase in total power generation are close for
RD (33.6%) and for BS (42.6%) scenarios. This is because under the RD scenario, 92.9% of
the increased power demand will be met by low carbon energy sources, while in the BS scenario
only 56.2% of the increased demand is provided by low carbon energy sources.
Compared to BS and RD scenario, the improved energy structure (IES) scenario is a more
realistic reflection of China’s power system in post-COVID era. It accounts for the high growth
potential as predicted from historical data (Fig3 and SI Fig 5), as well as the decarbonized
power system under the impact of the COVID-19. The reduced power demand growth in 2020
is closely related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is unlikely to continue as the economy
recovers (Fig. 1). In contrast, the fast-increasing low carbon power generation is linked to
speedy expansion of China’s low carbon generation capacities (Fig. 5). As emphasised by the
“14th Five Year Plan”, this expansion will continue in the near future as part of China’s national
policy towards carbon neutrality in 2060. IES evaluated the potential GHG emission with
continuous increasing power demand and fast increasing low carbon power (same speed as
2019-2020). Results show that even with the high power demand growing potential as 20102019 (towards 1.08 × 104 TWh, thus 42.6% in power demand by 2030), GHG emission will
only increase by 18.9%. By 2030, nearly half of the power demand can be provided by low
carbon energy sources (Fig. 3e).

capacity change. All changes refer to year-over-year relative change, expressed in percentage. Data for
January to October are averaged over 5-days interval. For November and December, interpolation and
prediction methods were used to account for compromised data quality due to intensive cloud coverage.

Climatic factors and uncertainties
In order to discriminate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic from other factors such as
temperature abnormality and resource availability. Power demand change can be partially
explained by abnormally warmer or colder temperature. In general, there is medium to strong

correlation between temperature and daily power generation (SI Fig. 3). With this correlation,
we found that temperature could only explain a small fraction of power generation variation:
among the 3.5% increase in year-end total demand, temperature accounted for -0.5% (details
see Methods, temperature abnormality and correlation between temperature and power
generation see SI Fig. 3, monthly temperature related power change see SI Table.1). Other
climatic factors also played limited roles in the change. For example, wind and solar power
increased by 14.1% and 15.9%, respectively, while wind and solar resources availability
showed only 0.9% increase and 0.52% decline, respectively (analysed by corrected wind
speed8,22,23 and solar radiation23 reanalysis data, details see Methods, relative change over time
see Fig. 5). The increased wind and solar power production are in line with the fast-expanding
power plants due to stimulating policies 9, which led to 34.6% and 24.1% increase in wind and
solar installed generation capacity, respectively (Fig. 5).
As there are no other database provides up-to-date daily power generation and emission data
for China, it is therefore difficult to evaluate the uncertainty of our constructed near-real-time
power generation and emission data based on cross-compression methods. Nevertheless, we
performed uncertainty analysis with available monthly or yearly data from literature (detail see
Methods and ref3). The overall estimation of total power generation show small uncertainty (±
1.1 %). However, it is ± 4.4% for total emissions, mainly comes from uncertainties embedded
in emission factors.
For scenario analysis, as we projected uncertainty derived from year-over-year variabilities
and from emission factors. The abnormalities in power demand and generation from 2010-2019
are considered for future projections. Yet, there are still uncertainties in further projections. The
power sector is a dynamic system, which is also affected by costs, storage and other process
such as power transport. In order to achieve a constant or faster growth of low carbon power,
resource capacity and transmission infrastructure must be scaled up quickly, to account for the
imbalance between temporal and spatial imbalance between low carbon power resource and
power demand. There is also uncertainty associated with emission estimation. Although the
emission factor uncertainty is already considered in this study, the ranges of emission factors
in this study are estimated based on current available technologies. It is possible that with
technology advancement, there will be further decline in power related emissions and in carbon
intensity.

Discussion and Conclusions
The accelerated growth of low-carbon energy during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 show
that low-carbon energy, due to its low marginal costs and low operational requirements, are the
preferred option under such emergencies. The continuous growth of low-carbon energy in the
recovery phase also further exhibit its robustness even with rebounded demand. There are still
greater potentials for low-carbon energy technologies in China. Studies have shown that there
is still great resource availability for China’s low-carbon energy, such as hydro-electricity24,

wind8, and solar power25. The upcoming “14th Five-Year-Plan” will entail further expansion of
low-carbon energy infrastructure and greater shares of low-carbon energy sources in the energy
mix, as key means for achieving China’s carbon neutrality goal.
We show that with the same development rate as observed in the past decade, there will be
substantial growth of power related emission from China. Urgent actions are needed to prevent
this growth and to reduce carbon emission, including both to cap the power demand in the near
future and to further expand low carbon power capacities. The marginal cost of renewables will
decline further as more renewables installed. Wind power alone has the potential to meet
projected increases in China’s electricity demand between now and 2030, which could in turn
reduce carbon emissions by 30% over the same period 8. Studies suggested that 62% of China’s
electricity could come from non-fossil sources by 2030 at a cost that is 11% lower than if
achieved through a business-as-usual approach. Further, China’s power sector could cut half of
its 2015 level carbon emissions at a cost about 6% lower compared with business-as-usual
conditions6. To date, the speed of grid expansion has lagged behind new renewable capacity, so
that China is deploying more renewable technologies than it can effectively use. For example,
substantial quantities of wind generation are curtailed in rural China. Further investments in the
national grid are thus urgently needed to facilitate continued growth in renewable generation.
Coordination of energy storage may eventually be similarly important.
The COVID-19 pandemic will have a long-lasting effect on the electricity system. For
example, although restrictions have been relaxed, residential electricity consumption has
remained high, suggesting persistent behavioural changes of people staying home. Similarly,
despite recovering at the end of 2020, demand in the tertiary sector (i.e. service sector)
experienced a long lag period as compared with other sectors. The electricity system may
eventually change accordingly. For example, decentralized generation may be well-suited to
larger residential demands, but more localized grid management and power storage system will
be required to balance the difference between power generation and demand peaks. As the
world recovers from the pandemic and economic growth resumes, China’s climate goals leave
little margin for delay. The country must continue and accelerate both its deployment of lowcarbon generation and its retirement of coal power plants. Despite modest growth in Chinese
emissions in 2020, the trends and drivers of those emissions suggest that decarbonization in the
country has begun; the next few years are critical.

Methods
Power data compiling, assimilation and simulation
Source-specific electricity generation was calculated from source-specific monthly installed
capacity multiplied by corresponding monthly full load hours. We compiled monthly installed
capacity data and full load hour data from China Electricity Council when available

(https://cec.org.cn/detail/index.html?3-291651). When such monthly data is not available, we
acquired supplementary monthly source-specific electricity generation data from the National
Bureau of Statistics of China. China Electricity Council data was preferred over the other
because it provides information on all in-grid electricity generation, while the other source only
includes electricity generation from power plants over certain scales. For Solar electricity, for
example, China Electricity Council provides information on both centralized and distributed
photo-voltaic, while National Bureau of Statistics only covers power generation from
centralized photo-voltaic. Exclusion of distributed photovoltaic, however, will lead to serious
underestimation of total solar power generated in China, as the corresponding installed capacity
accounts for nearly 50% of China’s solar power system.
The power sources of which China Electricity Council provides detailed information on are
thermal power, coal-fired power, gas-fired power, nuclear power, hydro-electricity, in-grid wind
power, total photo-voltaic and distributed photo-voltaic (list and relationship with terms used
in this study see Table 2). Thermal power includes power generated from coal, natural-gas,
oil(petroleum), biomass, waste burning and power generation from residual pressure and
residual temperature. After substituting coal and gas-fired power from thermal power, the rest
of thermal power was dis-aggregated into oil-fired power and biomass, waste burning and
power generated from residual pressure and residual temperature. Oil-fired power was further
dis-aggregated from the other sources with additional monthly and yearly available fraction
data from IEA26 and BP27.

We acquired daily thermal power mainly from State Grid, China from January 2018 till
September, 2020. For months when direct daily thermal power data were not available (prior
to 2018 and data gaps after 2018), we further estimate the daily thermal power production with
the daily coal consumption of the Zhejiang Power Corporation (https://www.wind.com.cn/)
with polynomial linear regression. Then this daily coal production data was used to
disaggregate the monthly thermal power generation data from the National Bureau of Statistics
(https://data.stats.gov.cn/). Following, daily source-specific power production data was
generated with the daily-thermal power data and the pre-compiled monthly source-specific
power production data.
Life-cycle Emission and Carbon intensity calculation
Lifecycle analysis is used to analyse the GHG footprint from the whole life cycle and its supply
chain28, including the upstream energy consumption and the fuel use for plant building,
operation, and infrastructure etc15. Thus, in this study, we assess the life-cycle emissions from
the power sector by multiplying the electricity production with the corresponding lifecycle
emission factors (see Table 3) by different technologies (Eq. 1).

𝐺𝐻𝐺 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 = 𝛴(𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 × 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖 )

(1)

Here, the lifecycle GHG emission factors adopted in this study are collected from the IPCC
report Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation in 2010 (ref 29). The emission
factors by different power generation technologies were reviewed and summarized by the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) based on near 300 screening publications of
lifecycle assessments of electricity generation technologies. All lifecycle emission factors
collected from the publications were categorized by technology and converted to the same unit.
It should be noted that the lifecycle emission factors exclude the land-use-change-related and
heat-related emissions30. The lifecycle GHG emissions in this study only focus on the electricity
production-related activities in its supply chain.
The carbon intensity of energy mix is calculated by the following equation (Eq. 2), defined as
the GHG emitted per unit of electricity produced:
𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑛 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 𝐺𝐻𝐺 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 / 𝐸𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

Table 3 | Life cycle emission factors by energy types. Data acquired, synthesised and
adopted from IPCC special reports29,30, which carried out a comprehensive review from
lifecycle assessment publications of different electricity generation technologies. The
range of hydro power emission factors are adjusted based on literature 31, with a focus on
hydroelectricity facilities based on run of river and non-tropical reservoirs, excluding
hydroelectricity facility types which are not commonly found in China, for example the
ones in tropical regions.

Power demand data compiling, assimilation and associated emission calculation
China power consumption data for 2019 and 2020 were derived from China Electricity Council
electricity

consumption

and

quarterly

statistical

analysis

briefing

reports

(https://cec.org.cn/menu/index.html?303). The total consumption was categorized into those
consumed in the primary sector, the secondary sector, the tertiary sector as well as the
residential (urban and rural). According to the reports, we analyzed the electricity consumption
distribution of the secondary sector in greater detail, mainly the industry sector and its major
component the manufacturing industry. This is meaningful in that the industry sector is still the
largest consumer of electricity in China32, hence the changes of consumption structure and
pattern within it will bear the greatest policy implication of electricity sector transform. Further,
in order to gain more insights into the sectoral effects on electricity consumption and associated
emission from the demand side, the manufacturing industry was divided into high-tech and
equipment manufacturing, consumer goods manufacturing, other manufacturing and the socalled ‘four energy-intensive manufacturing’, the latter of which includes ferrous and nonferrous metal, construction materials and chemical engineering sectors.
For May to November 2020, we directly obtained the consumption data and the year-on-year
change rates from the cumulative monthly reports according to the divisions mentioned above.
As such, the corresponding 2019 monthly consumption data were explicitly calculated as
follows:
𝐶(𝑖,2019) = 𝐶(𝑖,2020) ∗ 𝑟𝑖,𝑦−𝑜−𝑦 (𝑖: 𝑀𝑎𝑦 − 𝑁𝑜𝑣) (3)
where C is the consumption in 100 GWh and r is the year-on-year (y-o-y) change rate. On the
other hand, except for the ‘four energy-intensive manufacturing’ sector, the monthly data for
the other three manufacturing sectors prior to May 2020 were not available publicly. Therefore,
we assumed that for January to April 2020 the relative share of each of the three sub-sectors is
the same as the average between May and November, in estimating the consumption data before
then. Hence, we have:
𝐶𝑚,𝑛 = 𝐶(𝑚,𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔) ∗ (1 −

𝐶(𝑚,𝑓𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦−𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑣𝑒)
∑𝑖 𝐶(𝑖,𝑛)
)∗
𝐶(𝑚,𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔)
9

(𝑚: 𝐽𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑦 −

𝐴𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑙; 𝑛: ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ − 𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑝𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑟 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑠 & 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑠) (4)
To calculate the corresponding consumption data for 2019, we utilized the quarterly briefing
data (https://cec.org.cn/detail/index.html?3-281670) for consumption from January to March
and the year-on-year quarterly change rate, and further assumed that the distribution between
January and February (see below) and March was the same as 2020. Moreover, because China’s
statistical reporting follows the convention that January and February data were always
aggregated, we applied the generation data, which were separate for these two, as the proxy to
dis-aggregate the combined data, assuming that the generation distribution between January

and February was preserved in electricity consumption as follows:
𝐺𝐽𝑎𝑛
𝐺𝐹𝑒𝑏

=

𝐶𝐽𝑎𝑛

(5)

𝐶𝐹𝑒𝑏

where G stands for the generation data.
In calculating the CO2 emissions driven by the demand side, we firstly adopted the emission
factors for each electricity resources i.e. coal, nuclear, solar etc. from the IPCC 2014 report 33
and then obtained the weighted carbon intensity (gCO 2eq/kWh) for each month between 2019
and 2020, based on the sectoral electricity generation data available as shown below:
𝐶𝐼(𝑖

& 𝑚)

=

∑𝑥 𝐸𝐹𝑥 ∗𝐺(𝑖 & 𝑚,𝑥)
∑𝑥 𝐺(𝑖 % 𝑚,𝑥)

(𝑥: 𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑙, 𝑛𝑢𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑟, 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 𝑒𝑡𝑐. )

(6)

where CI and EF stand for carbon intensity and emission factor, respectively.
The monthly CO2 emissions associated with total and sectoral consumption were then
calculated by multiplying the carbon intensities by the corresponding consumption data
(activity). As such, it was effectively assumed that the generation portfolios are applicable in
each sector.
Climate factors and temperature effect
Wind and solar resource availabilities are estimated from wind speed and surface solar radiation.
The wind speed (WS) and solar radiation (Rs) are extracted from hourly ERA5 reanalysis
dataset

(The

dataset

can

be

downloaded

from

https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-singlelevels?tab=overview). The spatial resolution is 0.25° x 0.25°. We extracted the China mainland
area and aggerated the hourly data to 5 days average and monthly average to reduce noise and
show the seasonal cycle of Rs and WS for year 2018, 2019, and 2020 （Fig. 5）.
The temperature data is acquired from ECMWF atmospheric reanalyses data34. The relationship
between power demand and temperature change was expressed with linear regression models
between daily fossil power generation and daily averaged temperature, after removing extended
periods of holidays (Chinese New Year holiday and Chinese National Day holiday). This model
was established and tested with data from 2018 and 2019. By taking the temperature difference
between 2019 and 2020, the power demand change caused by temperature fluctuation was
estimated with the established linear regression models.
Index decomposition Analysis
We adopted the Logarithmic Mean Divisa Index (LMDI) decomposition method 35 to perform
the residual-free decomposition of the factors affecting GHG emissions related to China’s

power generation. The adopted expression35,36 is shown in Eq. 7:
E = ∑i E i = ∑i Q

Qi Ei
Q Qi

= ∑i QSi Ii

(7)

Where E is the total power related GHG emission (expressed as CO2-eq), Q is the gross power
generation, and Si and Ii are the shares of power source i generation and emission factor (CO2eq/generation) of power source i, respectively. The contribution of each driving factor causing
the emission change (difference in GHG emissions between the t th month of 2020 and the
corresponding month of 2019) can be expressed as the following equation (Eq. 8):
∆𝐸𝑡 = 𝐸𝑡 − 𝐸0 = ∆𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡 + ∆𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑟 + ∆𝐸𝑖𝑛𝑡

(8)

Where ∆E is the difference between the GHG emissions from the tth month of 2020 (𝐸𝑡 ) and
the GHG emissions from corresponding month of 2019 (𝐸0 ). The contribution from activity,
energy structure and emission intensity are noted as ∆𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡 , ∆𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑟 , and ∆𝐸𝑖𝑛𝑡 , respectively.
Activity effect is indicated by power generation. Energy structure effect is indicated by the
share of each power source in the energy mix. Emission intensity effect is indicated by the
energy source's emission factor, which is shown in Eq.9 - Eq.12:
𝑄𝑡

∆𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡 = ∑𝑖 𝑤𝑖 ln( 𝑖0 )
𝑄𝑖

𝑆𝑡

∆𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑟 = ∑𝑖 𝑤𝑖 ln( 𝑖0 )
𝑆𝑖

𝐼𝑡

∆𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑟 = ∑𝑖 𝑤𝑖 ln( 𝑖0 )
𝐼𝑖

𝑤𝑖 =

𝐸𝑖𝑡 −𝐸𝑖0

ln 𝐸𝑖𝑡 −ln 𝐸𝑖0

(Eq.9)
(Eq.10)
(Eq.11)
(Eq. 12)

Where 𝑄 𝑡 , 𝑆 𝑡 , and 𝐼 𝑡 are the power generation, energy structure, and emission factor of the tth
month, respectively. 𝑄 0 , 𝑆 0 , and 𝐼 0 are the power generation, energy structure, and emission
factor of the baseline month, respectively.
Uncertainty Analysis
We followed the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories37 to conduct
the uncertainty analysis for activity (power generation) and emission data. First, we estimated
the uncertainties embedded in activity data considering the accuracy of our database, and by
comparing with other widely used database26,27. As non-other database provides up-to-date
information on daily source-specific power generation, our uncertainty estimation is based on
monthly or yearly data when available. The uncertainty in activity data mainly comes from the
difference between databases. The uncertainty of total-power (± 1.1%) is higher than the
uncertainty of fossil-fired power (± 0.6%), but lower than the uncertainty of non-fossil low

carbon sources (± 4.5%). The largest uncertainty comes from oil-fired power (± 24.4%) and
biomass, geothermal and other renewables (± 27.7%). Coal-fired power, as the largest share in
the power mix, has only 0.7% uncertainty.
The uncertainty in the emission is estimated by propagating the uncertainty from activity data
and the uncertainty from emission factors. We combined uncertainty from all power sources
and computed the uncertainty of total emission with the error propagation equation from the
IPCC (Eq. 13).
𝑈𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 =

√∑(𝑈𝑠 ∗𝜇𝑠 )
|∑ 𝜇𝑠 |

(13)

Where Us is the share of emission from source s, s is the total emission from source s, and
Utotal is the standard deviation of total emission. The uncertainty is further expressed as
coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by corresponding mean estimation).
Scenarios of future GHG emission from China’s power system
The baseline scenario (BS) reflects a continuation of the 2010 – 2019 growth rate in power
demand and source-specific power generation. China’s inter-annual monthly source-specific
power generation show near-linear steady growth for the past decade (observed from activity
data, SI Fig5). Based on the assumption that this near-linear steady growth is preserved for
2020 (i.e. without the disruption of COVID-19) and for the near future (till 2030). We
established linear regression model as following equation (Eq.14), to generate the power
generation for the BAU scenario.
𝐺(𝑆,𝑀) = (𝑆,𝑀) 𝑌 +  (𝑆,𝑀) (14)
G(S,M) stands for the power generation for month m and from energy source S. Year is the
independent variable. We established the above-mentioned linear relationship for each energy
source and compiled the model parameters (S,M) and (S,M) , with monthly power generation
data from January 2010 to December 2019. We extrapolated the modelled relationship to 2020
and to 2030, under the assumption that the monthly power demand and generation continues
the near-linear growth. Prediction uncertainty is indicated by the 95% prediction interval.
Annual power generation is compiled as the sum of monthly source-specific power generation.
Uncertainty associated with annual power generation is compiled as the propagated error from
each monthly generation, expressed and calculated as the variance (Y), with the following
equation (Eq.15):
𝑌 = ∑ (S,M,Y) (15)
Where (S,M) is the variance associated with the predicted power generation by source S in
month M of year Y. Established linear regression curves are visualized in SI Fig3.
The Improved energy structure (IES) assumes the same growth rate of total power demand as
in the BS scenario. But for the non-coal power generation, it assumes that the growth from 2019

to 2020 will preserve for the next decade. In the IES scenario, the power demand which is not
met by the increasing non-coal power, will be met by coal-fired power. The reduced demand
with decarbonization (RD) scenario assumes a continuation of power demand and generation
change of 2019-2020 towards 2030. This scenario assumes that the power demand and sourcespecific power generation will increase at the same quantity as 2019 – 2020.
GHG emissions. With the above-mentioned source-specific power generation and the emission
factors in Table 3, we calculated source-specific GHG emissions (Eq.1). Total annual (or
monthly) GHG emissions are sums of these source-specific GHG emissions. The corresponding
carbon intensities are calculated with Eq.2.
