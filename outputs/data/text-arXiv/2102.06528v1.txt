The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted people’s life around the world, including how they
interact with mobile technologies. In this paper, we seek to develop an understanding of how the dynamic
trajectory of a pandemic shapes mobile phone users’ experiences. Through the lens of app popularity, we
approach this goal from a cross-country perspective. We compile a dataset consisting of six-month daily
snapshots of the most popular apps in the iOS App Store in China and the US, where the pandemic has
exhibited distinct trajectories. Using this longitudinal dataset, our analysis provides detailed patterns of
app ranking during the pandemic at both category and individual app levels. We reveal that app categories’
rankings are correlated with the pandemic, contingent upon country-specific development trajectories. Our
work offers rich insights into how the COVID-19, a typical global public health crisis, has influence people’s
day-to-day interaction with the Internet and mobile technologies.

INTRODUCTION

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted almost every aspect of human life. The pandemic
introduced changes in people’s perceptions and attitudes, as well as how they work, pursue leisure,
interact with others, and so on [21, 26, 33]. Among these changes, interacting with internet and
information technologies could be very significant. Compared with prior years, technologies have
played a critical role in the pandemic, as an essential infrastructure for supporting the response
to the pandemic. For instance, to help curb its spread, governments and public health authorities
around the world have launched contact-tracing apps [18, 23]. Given that mobile phones have
been the most popular and pervasive interfaces for people to interact with the Internet, most
technological experience has occurred via mobile apps. We therefore posit that the popularity of
mobile apps, as well as their dynamics, may provide a lens for understanding people’s experiences with
technologies during the pandemic.
Due to the different strategies employed by countries in fighting COVID-19, as well as the
degree of public compliance, the regional development of the pandemic has exhibited distinct
patterns. For example, China introduced a strict nation-wide lockdown during the initial outbreak
and achieved strong public cooperation, making the pandemic largely under control in most of
areas from April [19]. In contrast, the United States, although implementing multiple measures at
different levels, failed to contain the pandemic, resulting in chaos spanning the entire year [11].
We conjecture that such differences may be reflected in the app popularity in different countries.
Thus, understanding people’s experiences with mobile apps must consider the country-specific patterns
of the pandemic.
This Work. In this paper, we seek to understand, characterize, and compare the dynamics of
app popularity during the pandemic, under the circumstance of different country-specific pandemic

development patterns. We are particularly keen to explore the relationship between app utilization
and the infection trajectories experienced across countries. We first create the daily snapshots of
the ranking of popular apps in the iOS App Store in both China and the United States (US), from
the January 2020 to the end of June 2020 (See Section 3). This longitudinal dataset enables us to
study app usage behavior evolution across billions of mobile users in both China and US. We next
characterize the dynamics of app popularity from both a Macro- (i.e., app category) and Micro- (i.e.,
individual app) lens. We investigate which app categories are positively or negatively correlated
with the coronavirus pandemic and try to formulate general laws in their ranking evolution (See
Section 4), especially when comparing the differing situations and cultures in China and the US.
We further perform fine-grained per-app analysis (See Section 5), to summarize the dynamics of
app popularity. Finally, we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced side-effects
on the app maintenance behaviors (e.g., performance) by analyzing millions of app reviews (See
Section 6). We highlight a number of key findings:
• COVID-19 has played a key role in changing the popularity of some categories of app. During the
outbreak, several app categories experienced significant ups and downs in popularity in both
China and the US, particularly Business, Education, Navigation, and Travel. This change
reflects the reactions and efforts people made in response to the outbreak, and highlights
differences between China and the US.
• The impact of COVID-19 on app rankings are diverse and can vary from country to country.
There are many apps in our dataset whose rankings are strongly correlated, either positively
or negatively, with the pandemic case rates. Their ranking variations can be classified into
several groups. Most apps within the same group share some similarities in their adaptation
to the pandemic situation.
• The rapid popularity of some apps may be accompanied by the side effect of declining ratings,
especially for Chinese apps. We explore the reasons for this from the app reviews and found
a massive increase in the number of negative reviews compared to the pre-popularity. We
reveal some potential challenges for apps.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to characterize the behavior
dynamics of mobile users through the lens of mobile app popularity. We have released our dataset
and the experimental results to the research community at Github:

2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
2.1 COVID-19 Pandemic in China and the United States
We start by describing the development of COVID-19 pandemic and contrasting the responses of
China and the US.
2.1.1 COVID-19 in China. The first case of COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China, in December
2019. In the face of a previously unknown virus, China rolled out perhaps the most ambitious,
agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history [5]. The central and local governments
launched the national emergency response and various prevention and control measures have been
implemented rapidly. Investigations began quickly and traced the outbreak to a seafood market,
which was immediately closed by Chinese authorities as an initial method to terminate all meat
trades.
In response to the rapid spread of SARS-Cov-2 within Hubei province, the Chinese government
expanded its precautionary measures, announcing a complete lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei
province cities by closing airports, railway stations, highway entrances, and suspending all local

public transportation to prevent anyone from entering or leaving [67]. The government also
implemented aggressive quarantine and social distancing in the entire country including cancelling
activities with large crowds, wearing a mask when going out, postponing the reopening of schools,
enabling home office, etc. After all the measures taken and people’s full commitment, a decline in
the number of new cases and deaths was clearly observed by the end of February. Later on, with
all the situation improvements happening, China announced the lifting of the embargo and travel
restrictions on Wuhan and restarting of the economy in April [1].
2.1.2 COVID-19 in US. The first case of COVID-19 in the US was reported on January 20, 2020 [30]
and the first known American deaths occurred in February [7]. President Donald Trump declared
the US outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Subsequently, restrictions were placed
on flights arriving from China [12, 14]. However, the initial US response to the outbreak was
otherwise slow in terms of preparing the medical system, halting other travel, and testing [6, 8, 13].
Meanwhile, Trump downplayed the threat posed by the virus and claimed the outbreak was under
control [10]. In addition, each state that had imposed a stay-at-home order or shelter in place had
begun lifting the restrictions of businesses and public spaces in May [9]. Despite its considerable
advantages — abundant resources, biomedical infrastructure, and scientific expertise — the US has
been severely hit by COVID-19. More than 21 million confirmed cases have been reported by the
time of writing, resulting in more than 368K deaths, which is the most of any country and the 14th
highest on a per capita basis [2, 3].
2.2

App Ranking in iOS App Store

App ranking refers to the position of an app in a store or marketplace. In general, app rankings can
reference not only how an app ranks in a search, but also the overall app rankings from the store.
These rankings are country specific, and can be viewed at an overall or category level. The Apple
App Store, one of the most common app marketplaces, provides the real-time app ranking lists both
overall and by category. In the world of apps, ranking is of utmost importance. A minor change in
rank can make a significant difference in traffic and revenue. Apptentive’s recent mobile consumer
survey [15] reveals that nearly half of all mobile app users identified browsing the app store charts
and search results (the placement on either of which depends on rankings) as a preferred method
for finding new apps. Simply put, higher rankings mean more downloads, and to some degree,
more money for app developers.
The Apple iOS App Store has a complex and highly guarded algorithm for determining rankings
for both keyword-based app store searches and composite top charts. Although the exact ranking
algorithms are not publicly available, there are several known factors that influence the rankings,
including downloads (how many people have downloaded the app), rating (how many stars people
give the app), rating count (how many ratings the app has) and trends (how quickly the app is
growing), etc [4]. Since it is the combination of several other factors (average rating, number of ratings,
installs, etc.), this ranking speaks to the overall awareness, usefulness, and satisfaction of an app.
Consequently, app ranking is a particularly useful metric for mobile app analysis, particularly, its
popularity.
2.3

Related Studies on COVID-19

Since its outbreak, COVID-19 has attracted much attention from various research communities.
A large number of studies are focused on the medical domain. Many medical researchers have
made tremendous contributions to pathology study, epidemiology study, treatment study and so
on [20, 42, 47, 70]. Also, a number of computer scientists have adopted computing techniques like
machine learning to help medical practitioners cope with the disease [34]. For example, Zhang et
, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: February 2020.

al. [66] proposed the confidence-aware anomaly detection (CAAD) model to screen viral pneumonia
on chest X-ray images. Wang et al. [61] proposed COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network
design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images.
There are a growing number of mobile app studies relevant to COVID-19. Ahmed et al. [17]
provided the first comprehensive review of contact tracing apps and discussed the concerns users
have reported regarding their usage. Oliver et al. [41] described how mobile phone data can guide
government and public health authorities in determining the best course of action to control the
COVID-19 pandemic and in assessing the effectiveness of control measures. He et al. [29] presented
a systematic analysis of coronavirus-themed mobile malware and found these apps aim to steal
users’ private information or to make a profit by phishing and extortion. There is also research into
security and privacy issues. For example, Sun et al. [48] proposed an automated assessment tool to
determine security and privacy weaknesses for apps, and undertook a user study to investigate
concerns regarding contact tracing apps. Sharma et al. [46] assessed privacy controls offered in
COVID-19 apps and users’ preferences if they were to adopt a COVID-19 app. Wang et al. [60]
reveals various issues related to contact tracing apps from the users’ perspective by analyzing a
large number of user reviews. Although a few previous studies have looked at COVID-19 through
the lens of mobile apps, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive study to
investigate mobile users’ reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of app ranking.
2.4

Related Work on the Mobile App Ecosystem

A large number of research studies have characterized the mobile app ecosystem from different
perspectives. Wang et al. [53] characterized the evolution of Google Play based on 5.3 million
app records collected from three snapshots of Google Play over three years. They observed that
although the overall ecosystem shows promising progress, there still exists a considerable number
of unsolved security issues. Besides, some studies were focused on app developers [56, 59, 62], app
market maintenance behaviors [54, 57, 58], app clone detection [35, 36, 52], third-party libraries [25,
40, 50, 64, 65], security [24, 31, 32, 38, 39, 49, 55, 68, 69] and privacy issues [37, 44, 45, 50, 51, 63] of
the ecosystem, based on app binary analysis, UI analysis, app traffic analysis, and app metadata
analysis, etc. This paper, investigates the mobile app ecosystem from a novel perspective, to
understanding how the dynamic trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic shapes mobile smartphone
users’ experiences.

STUDY DESIGN
Research Questions

Our study is driven by the following research questions:
RQ1 General Trends. Across different regions, what are the characteristics of app popularity during
COVID-19, and how are they impacted by regional measures?
RQ2 Behavior Patterns. What are the different patterns in the change of app popularity over
the course of the pandemic? We attempt to classify the app ranking variations according to
relevance to the pandemic, then examine the distribution of the number of apps in each class
and explore their characteristics.
RQ3 Side-effect. Considering that app popularity may change greatly during the COVID-19 pandemic, does it introduce any side-effect on app maintenance behaviors?
3.2

Data Collection

We first harvest a dataset of app popularity. Given that the most straightforward impact of COVID19 on the mobile app ecosystem will be mirrored in a number of popular apps, we leverage the

App Store’s ranking list and focus on the top-ranked apps. However, it is non-trivial to obtain
such a dataset as it requires effort to continuously monitor apps in the app market to check their
rankings. To this end, we implement a crawler to retrieve the daily app ranking list from iOS app
store. Considering that the pandemic in different countries can evolve in different ways, we take
two representative countries (China and the US), as case studies for comparison.
To be specific, we crawl the ranking list with top 1500 apps each day from January 1 to June 30,
2020, to keep track of the apps and their daily rankings, containing over 543K records in total for
the two countries. We then take the top 100 apps per day as the target of this study. Overall, there
are 586 unique apps in China and 590 apps in the US covering 22 categories, each of which ranked
in the top 100 for at least one day during a given half year. Besides, we collect ratings for each app
on a daily basis, as well as the reviews for some of these apps.
Table 1 summarizes our dataset.

Analysis Preliminaries

We briefly present the methodologies used in the subsequent sections.
3.3.1 Popularity of app categories. To understand which app categories are more competitive
and explore general laws in ranking evolution, we begin our analysis by investigating the most
intuitive metric of app-category popularity, i.e., the number of apps ranked in the top 100 for each
category. Specifically, we measure the popularity of category by app volume, i.e., the number of
apps belonging to that app category in the top-100. The larger the number, the more popular the
category is. We examine the number of apps in each category on a daily basis to gain insight into
how their popularity trends are changing. In more detail, we also zoom in on each category to
check the ranking variations of all apps in that category.
3.3.2 Correlation analysis. To understand if any apps have been significantly affected by the
pandemic, and whether the impact has been positive or negative, we also study the correlation
between the pandemic evolution and the app ranking changes, which could reflect the popularity
changes of apps, for each app. In our case, we measure the development of the pandemic situation
over the half year through two metrics, i.e., the number of daily new confirmed cases and daily
active cases, respectively. Moreover, we present a correlation comparison strategy based on Pearson
Correlation Coefficient [16]. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is a number that summarizes the
direction and closeness of linear relations between two variables, taking a value between -1 and 1.
The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1 (-1), the stronger the positive (negative) correlation is.
For each app, the daily ranking is viewed as a vector in Pearson Correlation Coefficient formula,
then the correlation degree is obtained separately from the daily number of newly diagnosed
cases and active cases in the corresponding countries. Note that we also take P-value into account
because it tells us whether the result of an experiment is statistically significant. Typically if the
P-value is lower than the conventional 5% (P<0.05), the correlation coefficient is called statistically
significant. Thus, results with P-value less than 0.05 are of concern to us, otherwise are ignored as
insignificantly correlated.

Finally, we calculate the correlation coefficient for each app and obtained 358(61.1%) apps in
China and 497(84.2%) apps in the US with statistically significant correlation with the number of
daily new cases in respective countries, as well as 425(72.5%) apps in China and 502(85.1%) apps in
the US with statistically significant correlation with daily active cases. The results illustrate that
the majority of apps have a statistically significant correlation between their rankings and the
COVID-19 case rates. This encourages and motivates the following analysis, i.e., the distributions
of these correlation coefficients at the overall and category level. Due to the greater number of
apps with statistically significant correlation between rankings and active cases compared to newly
confirmed cases, we take the active cases as the pandemic marker for the subsequent study. And
note that all the correlation coefficients provided below are statistically significant.

The dynamics of the popularity

4.1.1 Coarse-grained inspection. Figure 1 visualizes the dynamics of the popularity of each app
category. We use stacked bar charts to show the number of apps in each category among each
day’s top 100 apps in the app stores of China and the Unite States, respectively. As aforementioned,
there are 22 categories (see the legend in Figure 1). In a specific day, the change in the numbers of
apps in each category over time is represented by the fluctuations of the vertical lengths of the
corresponding color.

A Tale of Two Countries

In general, most category’s popularity does not exhibit significant fluctuations in either China
or the US. Some categories has been constantly popular over the long run, such as Games, Social
Networking, Photo & Video and Entertainment, as well as some being consistently less popular,
such as Reference, Medical and Weather. However, there are four categories that are worth noting
in both countries, i.e., Business, Education, Travel, and Navigation, whose popularity exhibits
remarkable dynamics along with the outbreak in the respective countries. We further examine the
details of the dynamics of their popularity.
4.1.2 Fine-grained inspection. For each of the four categories, we plot the overlay of scatter and
line charts for both countries in Figure 2. The scatter represents the ranking of each app in that
category and the lines show the number of newly confirmed and active COVID-19 cases per day.
First, we observe a number of Business apps (e.g., Tencent Meetings and Zoom Cloud Meetings)
and Education apps (e.g., Tencent Classroom and Google Classroom) jumped to the top of the list.
This started in early February in China and mid-March in the US, just as the COVID-19 began to
spread widely in the corresponding countries. This observation is quite straightforward since the
outbreak had quickly led to a large-scale shift to remote work for employees and online learning for
students. Besides, the Travel apps (e.g.,Ctrip and Airbnb) and Navigation apps (e.g., Baidu Maps
and Google Maps) show the opposite trend during the same time, with almost all of them falling
out of the top 100. This is also reasonable because the mandatory social distancing and quarantines
are required for containing virus transmission, which left such apps less desired. It is important
to note that the ranking changes in these four categories starts almost simultaneously with the
outbreak, which demonstrates the pandemic’s immediate impact. In sum, the findings indicate that
mobile app ecosystems have had immediate reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak. Regarding app
categories, COVID-19 has an effect of enhancing or decreasing the popularity of certain categories
of apps.
Comparing the two countries, it is also interesting to note that Navigation and Travel apps in
the US rebounded in mid-April and mid-May, respectively, while the US was still in the midst of an
increasingly severe pandemic situation. In contrast, the rankings for these two categories in China
improved only after the conditions began to improve. To some extent, this may reflect the different
attitudes of the two countries in dealing with COVID-19.
4.2

Correlation Analysis

As mentioned in the above, we employ Pearson Correlation Coefficient to explore the correlations
between app popularity and the pandemic situation. In this section, we provide correlation analysis
results at both the overall and category levels, respectively.
4.2.1 Overall distribution. Figure 3 presents the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the
correlation coefficients between app ranking and the number of active confirmed cases in the
two countries. The trends are very similar in the US and China, with a roughly 50:50 number of
positively and negatively correlated apps. Besides, there are indeed a number of apps whose ranking
changes have a clear correlation with the pandemic evolution in both countries. Specifically, 27% of
the apps in China have a correlation coefficient less than -0.4 and nearly 40% in the US. In addition,
over 20% of the apps show a correlation coefficient greater than 0.4 both in China and the US,
which manifests many positive correlations. More notably, 23% of the apps in the US and 10% in
China have correlation coefficients less than -0.6, and nearly 10% in both countries are greater than
0.6, which can be considered as strong or very strong correlations (see Table 2). This observation
suggests that many apps’ popularity does haves significant correlation with the development of
pandemic, positively or negatively.

4.2.2 Category-level distribution. We further study the distribution of correlations at the category
level. Figure 4 shows the boxplot of correlation coefficients for each category in China. The red line
in the box indicates the median, while the blue line represents the mean. First, we observe that
the two most prominent categories are Travel and Navigation, with all correlation coefficients
being positive and a median greater than 0.75. This indicates that there is a significant positive
correlation between pandemic situation and the ranking of apps in these two categories, i.e., the
ranking decreases as the pandemic situation worsens and increases when the situation improves
(as measured by case rate).
Moreover, most apps in the Education category have negative correlation coefficients with a
median of about -0.6, suggesting that Education apps are in general negatively correlated with
the pandemic situation. The findings are consistent with the evolution of the popularity of these
three categories, as previously discussed. However, for the Business category, there seems to be
no significant negative correlation discernible. A possible explanation is the long term popularity
for most Business apps after the outbreak, as we can observe in Figure 2(a). There are a number

of Business apps that jumped up the rankings during the outbreak and have been leading ever
since, even though the number of active cases has dwindled to almost nothing. As a result, there
is no significant positive or negative correlation in the later phases, thereby undermining the
overall correlation coefficient. We posit that we can examine it in more detail by splitting it into
two stages, which we will discuss later. In general, although most of the categories do not show a
significant positive or negative correlation, there are certain categories that do, such as Travel and
Navigation showing a strong positive correlation and Education presenting a strong negative
correlation.
The situation in the US is somewhat different. Figure 5 presents the boxplot of correlation
coefficients for each category in the US. Surprisingly, there seem to be no conspicuous categories
showing significant positive or negative correlations with the pandemic. Again focusing on the
Travel category, we can see the correlation coefficients range between -0.5 and 0.5, with a mean
close to 0, failing to indicate a strong correlation.
It is not hard to understand when we review Figure 2(c). Although the Travel apps have a
significant drop in ranking at the beginning, it only lasted for about two months and then gradually
rebounded back, during which time the number of diagnoses in general kept increasing, thus there
is no noticeable correlation between ranking and pandemic during the entire half year. In the
same vein, there is hardly any category in which app rankings are generally growing or declining
for a extended period, which weakens the correlations. Therefore, in terms of category level, the
correlation between app popularity and the pandemic seems to be less significant.
4.2.3 Summary. From the overall-level analysis, we can conclude that there are indeed a number of
apps that are strongly correlated with the outbreak situation over the six months of the pandemic,
positively or negatively, in both countries. In terms of the category level, the vast majority of
categories fail to demonstrate strong correlations. Besides, we can discover some distinctions in
the correlations between app rankings and pandemic conditions in China and the US. In China,
there are certain categories (e.g., Travel and Navigation) showing significant correlations, while
in the US, the correlations are not very strong in any category. This confirms that the impact of
COVID-19 on the mobile app ecosystem may differ from country to country.

TEMPORAL PATTERNS IN APP POPULARITY

We next introduce the findings related to the RQ2 . Up to now, we have identified that the case rates
of the outbreak have an immediate impact on app rankings, with a number of apps significantly
correlated with the outbreak. We then delve into the different patterns that each app ranking
conforms to, i.e., the different correlations with the pandemic trends. We make efforts to create
a taxonomy and classify the apps based on their calculated correlation coefficients, where each
category corresponds to a pattern of change in rankings. Considering the different trends in the
evolution of the pandemic situation in China and the United States over the first six months, i.e.,
China has experienced a progression from deterioration to improvement, while the US has tended to
be more severe. We therefore examine the situation in China in two stages for a more fine-grained
comparison.
The first stage was when the pandemic was worsening, and the second stage was when it was
improving. The cut-off date is February 17, when the number of new confirmed cases reached its
highest. Besides, since a larger correlation coefficient shows a more significant correlation, we
consider introducing a threshold n, and regard an app as strongly positively or negatively correlated
with the outbreak (overall or in a stage) whose absolute correlation coefficient is greater than n.
As such, the key challenge is to select an appropriate n. Nevertheless, the correlation coefficient
represents an effect size and so we can verbally describe the strength of the correlation using the
guide that Evans [27] suggests for the absolute value of r in Table 2. Thus, we set the threshold to 0.6.
To be specific, we take 𝑟 > 0.6 as strong positive correlation (SPC) and 𝑟 < −0.6 as strong negative
correlation (SNC). Under all these scenarios, we create a taxonomy including eight categories for
China and two categories for the US.
5.1

Taxonomy

5.1.1 China. In China, we consider the situation from both an overall and a phased perspective.
(1) Overall-level. We start with checking the correlation coefficient r between the app ranking
and the overall period of the pandemic. If r>0.6 we classify the app as “SPC with the overall.”
Similarly, we categorize the app as “SNC with the overall” if its r<-0.6.
(2) Stage-level. For the apps without a strong correlation between its ranking and the overall
pandemic period, we then examine their correlations with the two stages respectively, i.e., the

growth stage of the pandemic and the decline stage of the pandemic. If an app’s rank is strongly
correlated to only one of the stages, we label it as a one-stage correlation. Concretely, there are
four categories including “SPC with growth stage”, “SNC with growth stage”, “SPC with decline
stage” and “SNC with decline stage.”
If an app’s ranking is strongly correlated with both stages but in opposite directions, we deem it
as two-stages correlation. Specifically, there are two categories including “SPC with growth stage,
SNC with decline stage” and “SNC with growth stage, SPC with decline stage.”
5.1.2 US. In the US, the situation is relatively straightforward due to the single upward trend of
the pandemic, and we can simply focus on two categories, i.e., “SPC with the overall” and “SNC
with the overall.”
5.1.3 Results. Based on the above, we classify the apps in the two countries separately and the
results are shown in Table 3. For China, we have eight categories due to the shifts in the pandemic
trend, with the number of apps ranging from 2 to 44. In the US, there are two categories with app
quantities of 72 and 116, respectively.

Per Group Analysis

As aforementioned, each of the four groups symbolize a pattern of how an app’s ranking changes
in response to the outbreak. We next deep dive into each group.
5.2.1 SPC with the overall in China. There are 41 apps in China whose app rankings are strongly
positively related to the pandemic situation, i.e., they suffered a regression in ranking when the

pandemic got worse (measured by case rate). Subsequently, their rankings rebounded as the
situation recovered. The app with the strongest correlation (0.911) is Dianping, a leading local
lifestyle information and trading platform in China, providing users with information services such
as merchant information, consumer reviews and offers, as well as transaction services including
group buying, restaurant reservations, takeaway and e-membership card. It is followed by TikTak
Travel (0.885), Ctrip Travel (0.882) and Tencent Maps (0.876), all of which cater to services like
travel and navigation. Unsurprisingly, most of the apps in this category are closely tied to outdoor
activities. Given the strict quarantine policy during the outbreak in China, it is no wonder that the
rankings of this kind of apps undergo such a shift. The trend comparisons for two representative
apps are visualized in Figure 6. The red line shows the ranking of the app each day and the green
line presents the number of active confirmed cases per day. We can observe that their trends are
almost identical.

5.2.2 SNC with the overall in China. The situation in this category is opposite to the previous
one. There is a strong negative correlation between the app ranking and the pandemic case rate
trends for the 44 apps in this category. This means that the outbreak has contributed to the growth
of their rankings. The subsequent recovery has therefore resulted in a drop in the rankings. For
context, Figure 7 presents two example apps with these properties. We see opposite trends in the
app ranking vs. case rate. Note that since the Apple Store’s app ranking list offers up to 1,500 slots,
for rankings that fall out of the top 1,500, we replace them with 1,500 in the chart.
We highly four prominent examples that exhibit these behaviors: 1) Happy Disappear, a tripleelimination casual game with the strongest Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.916, which may be
a good choice for people to pass time during the lockdown. 2) Diandu (-0.88), an educational app
for primary and secondary school language, mathematics, and English learning, which is helpful
for tutoring children during the extended period of home study. 3) Yong Hui Buy Food (-0.818),
an online service platform that provides consumers with fresh food and other grocery products
through home delivery services, which alleviates the inconvenience of going out to buy food during
quarantine. 4) Tinker Medicine (-0.776), a pharmaceutical and health product that helps pharmacies
provide convenient services to the public and provides free delivery services for users who place
orders through the app. Overall, we observe that most apps in this category have a positive effect
on people’s lives in some way during the pandemic.
5.2.3 SPC with the growth stage in China. In this category, the app ranking is strongly positively
correlated only with the growth stage of the pandemic. In other words, as the situation gets worse,
the app ranking drops; yet it does not show a definitive upward or downward trend as the situation
recovers. For example, there are two typical apps shown in Figure 8. One is called Eastern Airlines

that aims to provide safe and convenient ticketing and travel experiences. The other is Damek, a
comprehensive live entertainment ticket marketing platform in China, covering concerts, dramas,
musicals, sporting events, etc. Both of them have a high correlation coefficient between app ranking
and active cases in the pandemic growth stage (0.933 and 0.772, respectively). However, such
correlations are not that strong during the decline stage. This meas there are some apps that are
adversely affected by the pandemic but do not recover in tandem with the pandemic.

5.2.4 SNC with the growth stage in China. Similarly, we investigate the situation where app
rankings are only strongly negatively correlated with the growth stage of the pandemic, i.e., as
the pandemic worsened, the app ranking improved, but there was no clear trend of a growing or
declining thereafter. We take a look at the following examples that have high correlation coefficients:
1) Tencent Classroom (-0.943) is a professional online education platform that provides teachers with
online teaching and students with interactive learning, which has been a great support for digital
learning due to the school closures. 2) Anhui Things (-0.93) is a mobile app for Anhui Province
Government Services Network designed to provide government services, high-frequency public
services and citizen-friendly service matters, which allows citizens to handle some business without
leaving home. 3) Tencent Meetings (-0.801) is a video conferencing product that features online
meetings, useful for the needs of users working from home. This indicates that there are a number
of apps that played an important role in the war against the pandemic, and continue to be used.
This may indicate longer-term implications in how people live and work after the pandemic.
5.2.5 SPC with decline stage in China. In this group, the correlation between app ranking and the
pandemic case rate is not significant in the first stage of the pandemic, but as the situation turns
better, the app ranking rises. For example, the app with the highest correlation coefficient (0.924)

in the decline stage is Shell Finder, a home searching platform featuring comprehensive and real
property information as well as industry innovations such as VR viewings, home valuation, and
intelligent recommendations. In addition, Traffic Management 12123 (0.881) is the official client
of the Internet traffic safety management platform, providing a full range of traffic services and
reservation of motor vehicle, driver’s license and illegal processing business, etc. As shown in
Figure 10, we can observe that the rankings of these apps were only slightly affected in the early days
of the pandemic. This reflects the fact that as the situation improves and people’s lives gradually
return to normal, some apps are coming back to the forefront as soon as possible.

5.2.6 SNC with decline stage in China. As expected, this category contains apps whose rankings
have a strong negative correlation with the active cases only in the decline stage, i.e., as the
pandemic improves, the ranking declines. For this case, some apps may seem less important as
people gradually return to their normal lives. For example, the app with the highest correlation
coefficient (-0.852) is Fast View, an informational app that aggregates and provides users different
forms of content including graphics, videos, etc., as well as current affairs content and the latest
real-time information. Furthermore, there is an online gaming app called Doudizhu (-0.762), which
is a very popular card game in China. This rose to the top of the rankings at the beginning of the
outbreak, but quickly declined for a long time as shown in Figure 11(b). These apps seem to become
popular for a short period of the outbreak as a means for people to keep abreast of events or to
pass the time. However, they cannot last very long, especially when people return to their normal
life routines.

both stages but in different directions. There are 7 apps that show strongly positive correlations
during the growth stage of the pandemic while exhibiting negative correlations with the decline
stage. Their rankings can be roughly treated as constantly declining over the outbreak. For example,
there is a puzzle elimination game called Cube Battle that has fallen steadily out of the top 1,500
since the outbreak began, as shown in Figure 12(a). It has a high correlation coefficient of 0.803
within the growth stage and -0.878 within the decline stage. In contrast, the 2 apps that are strongly
negatively correlated with the growth stage and positively related to the decline stage exhibit the
opposite trend, i.e., the ranking is almost continuously rising for most of the time. For example,
there is a beauty and cosmetic app called SoYong that has a generally fluctuating upward trend in
the ranking from February to May, as displayed in Figure 12(b). It has the correlation coefficient of
-0.86 within the growth stage and 0.717 within the decline stage. Note that both types are few in
number, indicating that the two evolving patterns may be very uncommon.

5.2.8 SPC and SNC in the US.. Due to the single trend in the number of the active confirmed cases
in the US, i.e., consistently increasing since mid-March, we construct two categories: SPC and SNC
with the overall, with 72 and 116 apps, respectively. Since the pandemic situation in the US has
been increasingly serious, the apps with an SPC to the pandemic case rate should show a largely
declining ranking. For example, the app with the highest correlation coefficient (0.965) is a gaming
app called Trivia Crack, which has its ranking change in parallel with the number of active cases,
as shown in Figure 13(a). In contrast, the apps with an SNC with the pandemic display a generally
rising trend. An example is displayed in Figure 13(b), which is an app called Videoleap Video Editor
& Maker (-0.88), which is an app for producing videos. Its ranking has kept advancing during the
six months.

Summary

In summary, the pandemic has diverse patterns in terms of its impact on app ranking. In China, 85
out of 586 apps are strongly correlated with the half-year pandemic, either positively or negatively.
Moreover, 111 apps have strong correlations (positive or negative) with only one stage of the
pandemic (growth or decline). 9 apps even show strong correlations with the two stages in different
directions. These correlation categories reflect different characteristics of the COVID-19 effect
on app rankings. Most of the apps in the same category share some similarities in terms of their
adaptability to the pandemic situation. While for the US, since the vast majority of apps are
game apps, this somewhat limits our study of the adaptation of app functions and features to the
pandemic.
6

CHARACTERIZING SIDE EFFECTS

We conclude by briefly inspecting side effects that may be caused by these rapid fluctuations in app
popularity. Particularly, an interesting phenomenon we observe is that the ratings of some apps
are likely to decrease in varying degrees as their rankings go up. For example, Figure 14 shows
the trends in ranking and rating of the two app examples over this period. While the ranking
and popularity of the app is rising rapidly, its rating is experiencing a decline. This prompts us
to investigate whether the rise in app ranking and popularity may have some side effects on app
maintenance behavior.

Ratings Analysis

We briefly focus on those apps that gained popularity for a short or long time as COVID-19 hit,
exploring the relationship between their ratings and rankings. Considering that there is a wide

A Tale of Two Countries

diversity in the evolution of many app rankings throughout the time span, we shorten the time
frame to the period when COVID-19 was first spreading, and target only those apps whose rankings
rose rapidly during this period.
Specifically, for China, we choose the period when the ranking exhibits strong negative correlation
with the number of active confirmed cases during the worsening of the COVID-19, i.e., from January
to mid-February. For the US, we pay attention to the two months just after the outbreak of COVID-19,
i.e., from March to May.
We then calculate the correlation coefficients between the ratings and rankings of the focused
apps. The results are presented in Table 4. We see that there were 95 apps in China and 88 apps in
the US that improved their rankings significantly at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Of
these, 63 apps in China and 24 apps in the US have a correlation coefficient r>0 between rating and
ranking. This means that their ratings decreased as their ranking rises, i.e., introducing side effects.
Curiously, the results show that this particle side effect is more prevalent in China than the US.

Reviews Analysis

We have shown that some apps that gains popularity while experiencing a decline in their ratings.
We next dive into the reasons behind this phenomenon and investigate the challenges for app
developers. Previous studies [22, 43] showed that reviews represent a rich source of information
for app developers, such as user requirements, bug reports, feature requests, and documentation
of user experiences. Thus, we look at user reviews to analyze the possible reasons for the drop
in app ratings. It is important to note that while the ratings of all of these apps have dropped,
the magnitude of the drop varies greatly, with many showing only slight drops. For the sake of
representativeness, we target apps where the correlation coefficient between app rankings and
ratings is greater than 0.6 and the absolute value of the range of rating decline is greater than 0.1.
This leaves 37 apps for review analysis.
We use AppBot to extract the app reviews. This tool provides a large number of data-mining and
sentiment analysis features, and is used in many studies, e.g., [28]. For each app, we use AppBot for
automated text mining and sentiment analysis of reviews. To uncover new traits, we use reviews
from the second half of 2019 as the benchmark for comparision.
Overall, we find a significant increase in the number of reviews for these apps in the first half of
2020 compared to the second half of 2019. This is intuitive considering their increased demand. A
total of 1,355,460 reviews occur in the first half of 2020, which is 4.3 times more than the 313,209
reviews in the previous six months. More importantly, sentiment analysis reveals that the number
and percentage of negative reviews among them has also increased considerably, with a total of
716,129 negative reviews in the first half of 2020 (53%) compared to 72,345 in the second half of
2019 (23%), a visible number about 10 times higher. This is also the case for individual apps. For
example, Tencent Meeting had only 33 user reviews during the second half of 2019, of which only 5
(15%) were negative, while the number of reviews during the first half of 2020 was astonishingly
high at 10,507, of which 4,583 (44%) were negative. This may mean that such apps have struggled
to fulfil user expectations as their user base has grown.

Further, we focus on the negative reviews and seek to get a sense of the topics of user complaints.
We thereofre rely on AppBot’s topic grouping feature and identify six core topics raised within
these reviews:
(1) Bugs. There are lots of negative reviews describing problems with the app which should be
corrected, such as a crash, an erroneous behavior, or a performance issue. This is likely a product
of more users experimenting with the features of the apps.
(2) Device. There are many negative comments regarding the device, including device incompatibility, interface mismatch, lack of matching function and device features, unfriendly to ipad
devices, triggering device heat and lag, etc. Again, such issues become more prevalent as your user
base diversifies.
(3) Connectivity. This mainly refers to network connection problems, such as difficult WiFi
connections, slow loading, long waiting times, etc.
(4) Design & UX. There are some negative reviews about the user interface, specifically that the
user interface is not attractive, and the UI design and interaction are not friendly enough, making
the user experience poor.
(5) Video/Audio. For some apps, there are some problems with opening video or voice, such
as delay, not smooth, etc. Usually such complaints arise in apps featuring multi-person online
real-time sessions, such as online meetings and online lecture apps.
(6) Privacy. There are also some concerns about privacy and security of some apps, such as
invasion of privacy, sharing information with third-parties, stealing edits and tracking location, etc.
We further measure the distribution of different kinds of topics for each app, as shown in Figure 15.
As can be seen, the distribution of user concerns varies greatly across apps, where bugs and devices
issues are prevalent. We also notice that some of the issues are related to the increase in the number
of users. For example, Play It, a multiplayer interactive trivia game app in China, suffered several
crashes due to a surge in the number of users during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in China as
people were quarantined at home. Generally speaking, as more people use the app, the number
of complaints grows as well. Some issues that used to be obscure seem to be magnified, such as
the aesthetics of the user interface. This sudden popularity presents a great challenge to the app
in many aspects including functionality, compatibility, stability, fault tolerance and UI design, etc.
In a way, it serves as a wake-up call for developers to learn from the experience in dealing with
unexpected situations in the future. Meanwhile, it offers unprecedented opportunities for app
developers to resolve the hidden problems.

DISCUSSION
Implications

The most significant result in our paper is that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the app
rankings in app store. This impact is reflected in both the popularity of several categories and the
rankings of individual apps. Moreover, the evolution of app rankings are diverse and have a lot
to do with whether the features and functionalities of the apps are compatible with the current
environment. Besides, we notice that some apps that rapidly rise in popularity may also experience
the side effect of rating drops. This reflects the challenges that rapid changes in popularity can
cause app developers. We also note that findings are different between China and the United States.
The relevant stakeholders should take note of these findings, as they play different roles at
different levels of the app market. Our findings have further implications for understanding the
behavior of the mobile app ecosystem during public health crises, and helps developers to make
better decisions on app developmennt and management. As our first finding indicates, the popularity
of apps may experience disturbances resulting from public events. Such disturbances demonstrate

the importance of having a contingency plan. When some sudden public events such as the COVID19 pandemic happens, a contingency plan could help app developers, operators, as well as managers
better cope with them. For example, one may develop a quick server deployment plan when
expecting high demand. App developers may diversify their portfolios to avoid potential loss
caused by popularity decreases. The second finding suggests that the impact may be complicated,
depending on how the event is going on. Thus, app developers may need to develop the ability
to develop the short-term and long-term insights, and plan accordingly. For example, for an app
that gains popularity at the early phase of the pandemic but gradually return to normal later,
app developers need to decide if it is necessary to invest resources for the short-term spikes. We
also notice that increases of app popularity often coincide with decreases in ratings, and growing
number of reviews containing users’ insights. App developers thus need to be vigilant to users’
feedback, and take this opportunities to improve the app quality. Moreover, our results and findings
are not restrict to a specific event; it could be helpful in other public emergencies at the global scale.

Limitations

We recognize that our study carries several limitations and threats to validity. First, since the main
impact of the pandemic was reflected on only a small number of apps, we selected the top 100 apps
each day, yet there was no accepted standard for selecting this number. Second, in determining the
strength of the correlation, we set a threshold value of 0.6. However, there is no standard definition
for the selection of this threshold. Third, only a small number of apps have been used for our
review analysis. The major reason is that many apps have insignificant side effects. Hence, we are
concerned that reviews of such apps are not representative and reliable enough.

CONCLUSION

This paper has presented the first longitudinal empirical study of the evolution of app rankings
during COVID-19. Our analysis covers 586 apps in China and 590 apps in the US with records of
being ranked in the top 100 from January 1 to June 30, 2020, across 22 categories. We performed
analysis from the perspectives of category popularity. To further understand the evolution patterns
of app rankings, we proposed a correlation-based method to classify them and then perform a per
category analysis. Besides, we characterized the side effect of declining ratings accompanied by
the rising popularity of some apps. Our observations reveal mobile users’ reactions in the mobile
ecosystem in the face of unexpected public crises, and provide insights for app developers to make
better decisions on developing apps.
