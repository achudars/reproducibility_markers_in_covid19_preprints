Abstract
The Covid-19 pandemic has spread across the world since the beginning of 2020. Many regions
have experienced its effects. The state of South Carolina in the USA has seen cases since early
March 2020 and a primary peak in early April 2020. A lockdown was imposed on April 6th but
lifting of restrictions started on April 24th. The daily case and death data as reported by NCHS
(deaths) via the New York Times GitHUB repository have been analyzed and approaches to
modeling of the data are presented. Prediction is also considered and the role of asymptomatic
transmission is assessed as a latent unobserved effect. Two different time periods are
examined and one step prediction is provided.

1) Introduction
The Covid 19 pandemic has spread across the world since the beginning of 2020. In the US
there has been a large increase of cases (symptomatic) and deaths attributable to Covid19.
Many serious issues remain about predictive modeling, interventions and vaccines (for a recent
overview see Banks et al, 2020). Various data sources are now available that provide daily
counts of cases and fatalities for this disease. In this report we demonstrate the use of a
Bayesian susceptible-Infect-removed model with spatial geo-referencing at the county level in
South Carolina. The model specifies a transmission rate within each county as well as optionally
including neighboring county transmissions. Asymptomatic cases are assumed to be a
proportion of symptomatic and are included in the transmission model. An accounting equation
is assumed where the susceptible population is decremented by infectives and removals.
Predictions based on this model are possible, but the focus of this paper is mainly on the model
development and fitting. As the pandemic of Covid-19 develops, a variety of approaches to
modeling its spread are being presented ( e. g. Calavetti et al, 2020; Calafiore, 2020; Rouabah
et a;, 2020). Many of these models are time series-based, and do not incorporate spatial
structure in the modeling process. Within Bayesian modeling, few published examples exist
where the asymptomatic process is modelled (Zhou et al , 2020). However it is clear that cross
boundary transmission must occur (at least at the county level) and so ignoring this must limit
the ability of the models to account for this feature. In addition the use of random effects to allow
for confounding is often ignored. In the present approach we examine a range of models with
different assumptions about transmission and spatial dependence both in terms of fixed
predictors and
2) Data sources

Both Johns Hopkins University CSSE (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) and New York
Times (NYT) (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data ) provide data resources at the county
level within states of the US. In this report we have analysed the raw data hosted by NYT
provided from NCHS (deaths) and state health departments (cases). The data in general is
under-ascertained and potentially recorded at time of analysis with error due to misreporting and
changes in recording. This is especially true for death data where originally only hospital deaths
from Covid19 were recorded and reporting lag time is also present.
It is known that Covid19 has associated asymptomatic cases as well as symptomatic.
Asymptomatic cases are not reported usually, could be pre-symptomatic or not, and so cannot
be observed unless widespread repeated surveys are carried out in the population. Hence, as
these cases can infect others, they must be accounted for in any model. Deaths from Covid-19
for asymptomatic cases are not recorded at all, as they are not tested.
In what follows we assume that the case count (symptomatic) and death count at county level
for each day, are the data to be modelled. Of course the under-ascertainment of both case
count and deaths is a caveat in the subsequent interpretation. Handling of asymptomatic and
under-ascertainment is discussed in the modelling section.
3) Model Development
Susceptible–Infected-removed (SIR) compartment models have been used extensively for
infection modeling (Keeling and Rohani, 2008). Here the seasonal influenza SIR models by
Lawson and Song (2010) (L&S) which were applied spatially to county level biweekly count data
(C+ve laboratory notifications) for a single flu season, have been modified and employed to
model the Covid-19 count data. These were developed for a spatial application from the time
series models of Morton and Finkenstädt (2004) (M&F) which were applied to biweekly measles
data for English and Welsh towns for the period 1944 – 1963.
Our data is daily symptomatic ( yijsym ) case counts and daily death ( dij ) counts. Asymptomatic (

counties;  1,....,

yijasym ) case counts are considered as a proportion of yijsym counts. Denote the spatial and

days.

We also assume that the county susceptible population ( Sij ) at any given time is available. As
this does not vary much over a period of a few months then we can assume that the susceptible
population at the beginning of the monitoring can be used as a baseline. We do not have
access to disease data on sub groups within the population, such as age or gender, and so we
must assume a common population base.

The susceptible population in each spatial region (county) is quite large compared to the case
count and so it is reasonable to assume a Poisson model for the symptomatic counts, i.e.

Note that the conditional independence in the Bayesian hierarchical formulation allows us to
assume independence and hence a Poisson data model. An alternative to use a binomial
spatial model would be possible also. This doesn’t prohibit any extra variation or overdispersion

which often arises, as in the Bayesian formulation such variation can be accommodated at
higher levels of the hierarchy via prior distributions.

The Poisson mean (1) ( as for M&F) is assumed to be a function of current susceptibles and
some function of previous infectives as well as other propagating effects (e. g. random effects or
socio-economic predictors/covariates). Note that we also assume that the observed
symptomatic cases are to be modeled as opposed to the unobserved total case count. M&F
assumed that you can use a binomial model with unobserved total count as denominator (such
as

(, ) where  is a scaling factor) and the total (latent) count is subsequently

modelled. However this is a computationally very expensive undertaking, as none of the

are

observed and the complete latent field would have to be estimated. It is simpler to model the
observed count and use a scaling factor to estimate the true count at a later stage. This was the
approach adopted by L&S and is commonly assumed by health departments during
conventional influenza seasons.
In addition to the data model for new counts we also assume an accounting equation which is
used to update the susceptible population at each time point. We assume a susceptible –
Infected -removed (SIR) model, which is the simplest compartment model. SEIR models
including an exposed category are infeasible due to the lack of information about exposure
transitions. We assume that susceptibles, if infected, move to the infected category
(symptomatic and asymptomatic cases) and either are subsequently removed via death or other
forms such as recovery. In the Covid19 data available currently for the US we do not have
information on recovered individuals nor direct evidence of asymptomatic cases. As these can
affect the progression of the infection we must make assumptions about them. We assume in
what follows that the recovery rate is a proportion of the infective count.

Model 1) log f (Ty i , j -1 ) = b0 + b1 log[Ty i , j -1 ] + bi
Model 2) log f (Ty i , j -1 ) = b0 + b1 log[Ty i , j -1 +

Model 3) log f (Ty i , j -1 ) = b0 + b1 logTy i , j -1 + b2 [ xi ] + bi
Model 4) log f (Ty i , j -1 ) = b0 j + b1 log Ty i , j -1 + b2 [ xi ] + bi
Model 5) log f (Ty i , j -1 ) = b0i + b1 log Ty i , j -1 + b2 [ xi ] + v i
where

åTy

l , j -1

is the sum of neighboring infectives and xi is a poverty

l Îdi

covariate (% of population under the poverty line) and bi is a spatial random effect .
Note that b0 is a transmission rate (on the log scale) and we could estimate R0 based on

exp(b0 ) / R but when variants are used such as time dependent b0 j or spatially dependent b0i
then this is inappropriate. Model 1 has simple prior dependence on the last infective count in the
region, and a spatially structured effect bi . Model 2 has an added neighborhood dependence,
which could represent cross-boundary infection. Model 3 is as for model 1 but with a county
level poverty covariate, and model 4 and 5 include that covariate but also have different
transmission parameterisations. Model 5 drops the spatial random effect as the transmission is
spatially dependent, but includes a uncorrelated spatial effect ( vi ). The inclusion of the spatial
effects is really to allow for residual confounding whether spatially structured or not.
3.2 Prior distributions
The following prior distributions were assumed for the free model parameters. For fixed b0 and

b1 and b2 we assume a zero mean Gaussian prior distribution with precision having a gamma
(2,0.5) . The spatially structured effect is assumed to have a markov random field prior
distribution (ICAR) whereby
bi | j ¹i  N (Mi , t b-1 / ndi )
Mi =

åb / n
l

l Îdi

di

The precision has a gamma prior distribution also. The ICAR model was also assumed for the
b0 i in model 5. The temporally dependent b0 j was allowed to have an uncorrelated zero mean
Gaussian prior distribution with precision which also had a gamma (2,0.5) distribution. Prior
distribution choice is as to be as non-informative as possible, where appropriate. The gamma
prior distributions on precisions are weakly informative (STAN wiki 2020).
3.3 Computation
Our Bayesian hierarchical models and variants can be conveniently implemented via the
Bayesian modeling package nimble. This package is available on R and allows the
modeling of relatively complex hierarchical models with spatial signatures. The package
includes both ICAR and PCAR variants and is based on parsed versions of BUGS code but
composes its own C++ samplers. Its benchmark speed is exceptional for a range of problems.
All models were run to convergence, and checked using single chain Geweke diagnostics.
3.4 Model Selection

The deviance (D) based measure DIC (Spiegelhalter et al, 2014) was used, with the effective
ˆ = var(D ) / 2 , which is always
number of parameters computed from the conservative pD
available from MCMC samples. Lower values of DIC suggest improved fit.
4.0 Results
4.1 Daily Data: January 22nd to April 12th
The first analysis undertaken is for data from the period January 22nd to April 12th. This consists
of 82 days. Most of the early incidence is sparse and so many days through January and
February have zero counts for virtually all counties. Figure1 displays the county map of South
Carolina.

(b) county map

The main urban areas in the state are in Greenville, Spartanburg, Richland, Charleston and
Horry counties. As early as March 7th cases appeared in Kershaw county, which is close to the
state capital county of Richland. After this, most counties experience incidence which quickly
rises to various peaks in early April. Figure 2 displays the symptomatic count and death time
profiles for four counties.

April 12th.

It is notable that the coastal communities of Horry and Beaufort counties, which have an older
demographic, have earlier initiation of infection and earlier deaths than the main urban areas of
Charleston and Richland counties.

Note : 4c is as for model 4, but without the spatially structured ICAR component.

It is clearly the case that the lowest DIC is for model 4 and that models 1, 2, 3, 5 are not
competitive. Model 4 with its time dependent transmission rate is clearly better in describing
these data than other models. Model 4 variants were examined also. Model 4b allowed the
asymptomatic rate ( j ) to change from 0.25 to 0.5 in the model. While model 4c assumes a rate
of 10%. The lowest DIC is for model with 50% asymptomatic, although the 25% rate has only a
slightly higher DIC. Model 4d variant simply removed the ICAR spatial component and also
yielded a larger DIC. It’s also notable that the ICAR component seems to be important in the

description of the residual confounding in these data. The Appendix displays the nimble code for
the model 4).

and Kershaw counties. Figure 4 displays the posterior mean risk profiles for Beaufort and
Charleston counties. It is clear that the SIR model with time dependent transmission rate and
spatial confounding appears to fit the observed infection profiles reasonably well.

The overall DIC for the model is 14428.8, with pD of 128.2 which is considerably lower
that alternate models considered.
4.1 Daily Data: April 2nd to June 29th
The early period data demonstrates the beginnings of the outbreak where there were zero
cases until March and then a large increase during March and April. Crucially, the state was not
completely locked down until April 6th when a stay-at-home order was issued. By this time there
had been a large increase in cases. Partial lifting occurred on April 24th when some businesses
were allowed to open. Restaurants opened on May 1st. Following this date a gradual rise in
cases numbers occurred as social distancing and face covering recommendations were
apparently not adhered to, both in the general population and in hospitality industry venues.
A range of models as per the earlier time period were fitted to these data. Table 2 displays the
goodness of fit results. For these data model 3 provides the lowest DIC, although model 1 and

model 5 have close values. Model 3 assumes an asymptomatic rate of 25% and includes the
poverty covariate. Variants of model 3 with 50% asymptomatic and also no ICAR component
had much higher DICs. The posterior mean parameter estimates (and SDs) for the different
components are b0 : 8.036 (0.064), b1 : -0.542 (0.0052), b2 : -0.800 (0.0031). These are well
estimated and suggests an average transmission of 0.6 over the whole period, and a
dependence on % poverty of 0.449. It is notable that the asymptomatic rate assumption of 25%
proved to yield a better fit than 50%.

Figures 5 and 6 display the case count profiles and posterior mean estimates for a selection of counties
around the state, for model 3. It is notable that the estimates track the case counts in a smooth manner
but tend to adjust upward the lower counts during April and May but are downward biased during June,
when the counts increases markedly. Figure 7 displays the estimated mean square error profile for the
fitted model 3, computed at each time point. This displays the variation in fit and suggests a good fit in
early days but also supports that the model fits progressively less well when counts spike.

Prediction
Both within sample and beyond sample prediction could be important in the context of infection
modeling. The mean square predictive error is a measure of loss between predicted model and
observed outcomes within sample (Gelfand and Ghosh, 1998). Figure 8 displays the MSPE for
the fitted model 3 for these data, computed at each time point. It is noticable that the error is
reasonably small until a large peak or jump in risk occurs although the error does increase with

increasing spiking of risk.

Figure 9 One step predictions with 95% Bayesian credible intervals for SC counties for June 30th

As part of the predictive capability of the Bayesian space-time models it is possible to consider
‘step ahead’ forecasts for these data. There are a number of ways that predictive inference can
be used for temporal prediction. Here a simple one step (one day) prediction is made using the
final day (June 29th) to provide accounting update and model dependence on the final observed
counts. Figure 9 displays the prediction of SC counties for June 30th, with associated 95%
credible interval (shaded).areas. In particular Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Lexington, Richland
and Spartanburg have wide ranges. Its clear that the prediction interval is highly asymmetric
with a long tail in the higher risk levels.

Any prediction beyond one step that would involve extra variation due to the use of estimated
quantities in the modeling process and hence uncertainty would be propagated.
4.2 Models fitted to smoothed 3 day averages
Smoothed 3–day average data provides for some removal of anomalies in the count data.
Anomalies such as weekend reporting delays and changes in recording, could be ameliorated to
some degree by such smoothing. The smoothed counts could be assumed to be Poisson
distributed (even if averaged) and the smoothing will induce temporal correlation that can be
accommodated by the models. However, for consistency, the 3 day average of the centered
counts was computed, which produced smooth estimates at each daily time point. This should
also reduce the differentiation of neighboring areas and anomalies relates to weekend nonreporting.
Figure 10 displays the smoothed case data and death count for 4 SC counties for the first
period January 22nd to April 12th. Figure 11 displays the smoothed case and death data for April
2nd – to June 29th .

Figure 10 Time plots of smoothed case averages and deaths for the period of January 22nd to April 12th

Figure 11 Time plots of smoothed case averages and deaths for the period April 2nd to June 29th

Assume that yijsm is the 3 day smoothed symptomatic case average. As this is now continuous
and strictly positive, a different data model must be assumed. A log normal model for the 3 day
average was adopted so that yijsm = exp( yij* ); yij*  N (mij , t -y 1 ) . A range of models for mij have
been examined as in the non-smoothed case.
Both the original January-April and April-June data have been analyzed using the models 1) - 5)

It is notable that for the earlier data the model with the spatially varying intercept parameter
(model 5) has lowest DIC. This suggests that spatial structure plays an extra role in the earlier
period. In contrast in the later period the model with only the poverty covariate and spatial CAR
effect (model 3) has lowest DIC. For the later period a one step ahead forecast has also been
obtained from the smoothed model (3).
Figure 12 displays the smoothed 3 day prediction for the later data set. It is clear that
Charleston, Greenville, Horry and Richland have the largest intervals now and largest predicted
counts, and the influence of smoothing has reduced the prediction for Lexington and
Spartanburg.

5.0 Discussion
The main results from the different data sources and models are quite revealing. First it is clear
that for the early unsmoothed data the large increase in risk in late March-early April favored a
large asymptomatic rate and time dependence. This is likely due to the large variation over time
from zero counts to high incidence. For the later period from April 2nd to June 29th an
asymptomatic rate of 25% yielded a better fit and a model with both the poverty covariate and
spatial residual CAR effect were best for either the crude data or the smoothed data. In general
the smoothed data support a lower asymptomatic rate of 25%, inclusion of the county level
poverty covariate and spatial structure, either as a spatially-structured intercept (model 5) or as
a residual confounding (model 3). This further suggests that in the earlier period the time
dependence in the risk in the unsmoothed data was heterogeneous with respect to county
differences and so for the smoothed data spatial differentiation of risk was more obvious.

Figure 13 Posterior mean ICAR effect for model 3 for the
smoothed 3 day average data April 2nd ‐ June 29th

Figure 13 displays the residual spatial ICAR effect for
model 3 for the smoothed April‐June data set. It is clear
that the counties with greatest residual risk unexplained
are rural in nature: the urban areas have much lower and
negative residual effect. Figure 14 displays the spatially
structured ICAR intercept effect for model 5 for the Jan‐
April smoothed data. This suggests that transmission is
differentiated spatially and is higher in rural areas.

model 5 for the January ‐April smoothed data.

It is also notable that the neighborhood transmission model (model 2) was not selected for any
of these datasets. This may suggest that at county level the resolution level does not support
cross-boundary transmission. Finally it is also clear that % under the poverty line as a covariate
is significant in these models so that regions of higher % poverty contribute more to the risk
variation.

5.1 Further Modeling considerations and limitations
Currently available data are limited by a number of factors. Under-ascertainment of positive
cases is a major concern. Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people are not counted. Further
some patients may not attend for Covid-19 screening even if they are in fact positive for the
disease. In addition the under-ascertainment could be spatially and temporally differentiated in
that it could vary over time and between areas. For normal influenza seasons, health
departments often use a scale factor to allow for the iceberg effect of not observing the true
case load, when only lab confirmed cases are presented. This could be added for Covid-19 of
course. As an alternative the true case load could be included within a Bayesian model as a
latent effect.
An additional consideration is whether to model the death counts. If the focus is on the spread
of Covid-19 then the death count is only a secondary outcome. In fact it is dependent on the
true case count as opposed to infection process. A Poisson or binomial model could be
assumed for this purpose. However as the focus here was on infection spread and case counts
it has been assumed that death count is given and assumed fixed.
Another aspect of the data quality which has not been addressed here is the fact that the
degree of testing carried out affects the number of positive cases found.
Assume the following, conditioning on the number of tests:

yijsym  bin( pijp , nijt )
pijp : proportion of +ve tests and nijt is the total number of tests
The test positive proportion could be modeled via a logistic link such as: logit( pijp ) with
dependence on a sum of lagged case numbers, and for the i th region the neighboring county
sum of case numbers. The asymptomatic case numbers could be included as an additional
effect. However, data for the number of tests is not currently publicly accessible for county level
in SC and so this cannot be implemented at the moment, so this must remain a future
development.
6.0 Conclusions
Some conclusion can be drawn from the analysis described here. The most important
conclusions in this analysis of county level provincial data are as follows.
1) Smoothed data (at least 3 day averaged data) can yield different results from crude
unsmoothed count data, especially with respect to time dependence and spatial

smoothing. Smoothed data could induce greater spatial correlation and this was
highlighted above.
2) The asymptomatic rate was varied in these models and was found to best fit when it was
high (50%) for early unsmoothed data with a large spike in risk. More commonly 25%
rate was favored for later data and the smoothed 3 day average data in general.
CDC2020 lists a range of rates but cites 40% as the current best estimate
3) Poverty does provide better explanation of risk variation in these county level examples,
and hence its surrogates of unemployment, low median income, and ethnicity
differences could also be assumed to play a role. These additional predictors have not
been included here but may help to reduce the residual spatial structure in the risk
variation.
4) The value of spatio-temporal Bayesian modeling lies in the ability to flexible add both
observed explanatory variables and unobserved latent effects to model disease risk. In
our models we have achieved a reasonable measure of fit and made comparisons of
different models with different assumptions, provided insight into asymptomatic rate and
spatial differentiation of risk. The role of poverty is also clear. The ability to add crossboundary transmission as a gravity effect is also a feature of the modeling, although in
this case this was not selected in the best model.
