Abstract The SEIR model is a compartmental model used to simulate the dynamics
of an epidemic. In this chapter, we introduce two control functions in the compartmental SEIR model representing vaccination and plasma transfusion. Optimal
control problems are proposed to study the effects of these two control measures, on
the reduction of infected individuals and increase of recovered ones, with minimal
costs. Up to our knowledge, the plasma transfusion treatment has never been considered as a control strategy for epidemics mitigation. The proposed vaccination and
treatment strategies may have a real application in the challenging and hard problem
of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

1 Introduction
Like many other physical and biological processes, epidemics can be modelled mathematically. Epidemic mathematical modelling is important, not only to understand
the disease progression, but also to provide predictions about the epidemics evolution and insights about the dynamics of the transmission rate and the effectiveness
of control measures. There are several compartmental models in epidemiology, like
the 𝑆𝐼, 𝑆𝐼 𝑅, 𝑆𝐼𝐶 𝐴 and the 𝑆𝐸 𝐼 𝑅 model, see, e.g., [3, 14, 28] and references cited
therein. In this chapter, we consider the SEIR model, where the human population is
divided into four mutually exclusive compartments: susceptible 𝑆, latent 𝐸, infected
𝐼, and a recovered or removed (dead) 𝑅. We assume that the population is homogeneous and the various classes are uniformly mixed. We consider the case of constant
total population 𝑁, that is, 𝑆(𝑡) + 𝐸 (𝑡) + 𝐼 (𝑡) + 𝑅(𝑡) = 𝑁 for every time 𝑡 in the
time window 𝑡 ∈ [0, 𝑇] under study. In this case, the fraction of individuals in each
compartment is defined as 𝑠 = 𝑆/𝑁, 𝑒 = 𝐸/𝑁, 𝑖 = 𝐼/𝑁 and 𝑟 = 𝑅/𝑁. The balance
condition becomes 𝑠 + 𝑒 + 𝑖 + 𝑟 = 1. The assumptions made about the transmission
of the infection and incubation period are reflected in the equations and parameters
[14] and are explained below. We consider the following parameters:
• transmission coefficient – 𝛽;
• infectious rate – 𝛾;
• recovery rate – 𝜇.
Then the 𝑠𝑒𝑖𝑟 model is given by the following system of ordinary differential equations:

in the exposed class, which is proportional to the fraction of infective (and infectious)
and susceptible individuals, where the transmission coefficient 𝛽 > 0 is a constant
parameter. Individuals are transferred from the susceptible class 𝑠 to the exposed 𝑒
at this rate 𝛽 𝑠 𝑖. The incubation period is of 1/𝛾 days, with 𝛾 > 0, and after that
time exposed individuals become infectious. The rate of removal of infective to the
removed class is proportional to the number of infective, 𝜇 𝑖, with 𝜇 > 0, where 1/𝜇
is a measure of the time spent in the infectious state [14].

The 𝑠𝑒𝑖𝑟 model (1) is an extension of the classical Kermack–McKendrick 1927
model [10, 11], where the class of exposed (latent) individuals is considered. SEIR
type compartmental models have been extensively used to model the COVID-19
pandemic, see, e.g., [7, 22], and researchers have shown that it can describe the
spread of COVID-19 in different countries: see [5] for a simulation of the COVID-19
spread in Lombardy (Italy) and also modifications of the SEIR model in [13, 17, 19].
Namely, in [13] three classes are added for confined, under quarantine and COVID-19
induced deaths. The model in [17] considers the age of the population, time delay on
the development of the pandemic, and resusceptibility to COVID-19 with temporal
immune response. An age-structured SEIR model is proposed in [19] considering
5-year bands until the age of 70 years and a single category aged 75 and older
(resulting in 16 age categories for each class of individuals).
Optimal control theory is a branch of mathematics that involves finding optimal
ways of controlling a dynamic system [6, 18]. Optimal control has been applied to
epidemiological models for many different infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS,
malaria, Ebola, tuberculosis and cholera [2, 12, 24, 27], and also non communicable
diseases like cancer: see [21] and references cited therein.
Optimal control theory allows the study of the most cost-effective intervention
strategy that changes the dynamics of a controlled system while minimizing a socalled objective function. In this chapter, we introduce two control functions in
the 𝑠𝑒𝑖𝑟 model (1) that represent vaccination and plasma transfusion. Although
vaccination has been widely studied from an optimal control point of view applied to
epidemiological models, up to our knowledge, the plasma transfusion treatment has
never been considered before. Plasma transfusion has been considered as a possible
treatment for COVID-19, although it is still under study [1].
We propose five objective cost functionals and five corresponding optimal control
problems for the three control systems that correspond to vaccination only, plasma
transfusion treatment only, and combination of vaccination and plasma transfusion.
This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 2, the vaccination and plasma
transfusion are introduced in the 𝑠𝑒𝑖𝑟 model, isolated and in combination, giving rise
to three control systems that will be part of the optimal control problems proposed in
Section 3. In Section 4, the solutions of the optimal control problems are compared
numerically. We end with Section 5 of discussion and conclusions.

2 Control system: 𝒔𝒆𝒊𝒓 model with vaccination and plasma
transfusion
In this section, in order to control the spread of the infection, two types of interventions are introduced into the 𝑠𝑒𝑖𝑟 model (1): vaccination 𝑢 and plasma transfusion
𝑝. Instead of representing the vaccination and plasma transfusion by constant positive parameters, we assume that vaccination and plasma transfusion are given by
two functions 𝑢(·) and 𝑝(·), respectively, that change in time and that modify the

4

dynamical behavior of model (1). In optimal control theory, functions 𝑢(·) and 𝑝(·)
are usually called controls.
Starting by the vaccine, we introduce a control 𝑢(·) that represents the vaccination
rate. By definition, it only makes sense to vaccinate people if they are susceptible
to the disease. After being vaccinated, these people would become immune to the
disease. In terms of the 𝑠𝑒𝑖𝑟 model states, this means that an individual in the 𝑠 state
would jump to the 𝑟 state after being vaccinated. Thus, the model must be rewritten
in the following way:

[vaccination based control]

𝑑𝑠



𝑑𝑡 (𝑡) = −𝛽 𝑠(𝑡) 𝑖(𝑡) − 𝑢(𝑡) 𝑠(𝑡),


𝑑𝑒

 (𝑡) = 𝛽 𝑠(𝑡) 𝑖(𝑡) − 𝛾 𝑒(𝑡),
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑖
 𝑑𝑡




 𝑑𝑟 (𝑡) = 𝜇 𝑖(𝑡) + 𝑢(𝑡) 𝑠(𝑡),
 𝑑𝑡

(2)

where the control function 𝑢(·) is bounded between 0 and 𝑢 max ≤ 1.
Regarding treatment, the aim is to emulate a serological treatment, that is, a
plasma transfusion. A plasma transfusion consists on infusing sick individuals with
the blood plasma harvested from the immune individuals. Thus, in terms of the
model, it requires that a recovered individual 𝑟 donates plasma to an infectious
individual 𝑖. The control is the rate at which this transfusion happens. Let the control
be 𝑝(·). Then, the 𝑠𝑒𝑖𝑟 model (1) is rewritten in the following way:

[plasma transfusion based control]

𝑑𝑠



𝑑𝑡 (𝑡) = −𝛽 𝑠(𝑡) 𝑖(𝑡),





 𝑑𝑟 (𝑡) = 𝜇 𝑖(𝑡) + 𝑝(𝑡) 𝑟 (𝑡) 𝑖(𝑡),
 𝑑𝑡

(3)

where the control 𝑝(·) satisfies the control constraint 0 ≤ 𝑝(·) ≤ 𝑝 max ≤ 1.
Finally, the two previous controls are considered simultaneously, being the resulting model the following:

where the state variables satisfy 𝑠(𝑡)+𝑒(𝑡)+𝑖(𝑡)+𝑟 (𝑡) = 1, for all 𝑡 ∈ [0, 𝑇]. In order to
formulate an optimal control problem, a cost functional needs to be proposed, which
in our case we intend to maximize. We propose an optimal control problem for the
control systems given by (2), (3) or (4), with five different 𝐿 2 objective functionals,
denoted for simplicity by 𝐽𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 5. All of them are obtained from

𝐽5 = J(0,1,1,1) . Other cases of cost functionals are obviously possible, but we found
these five to be the most interesting. We also do not consider all possible combinations
between the three control systems and the five costs to be maximized, restricting
ourselves to five optimal control problems. Regarding the vaccination based control
(2), we consider the two objective functionals
𝐽1 (𝑢(·)) =
and
𝐽2 (𝑢(·)) =

When the cost functional is considered to be 𝐽1 , the main goal of maximizing the
functional is to minimize the fraction of infected individuals and, at the same time,
the vaccination costs. We compare the solution to this optimal control problem with
the one that maximizes 𝐽2 , that is, the one that maximize the fraction of recovered (immune) individuals and, simultaneously, minimizes the fraction of infected
individuals and the vaccination costs. The numerical solutions are compared in
Section 4.
When only the treatment by plasma transfusion is considered, that is, when we
focus ourselves on the control system (3), we use the objective functionals 𝐽3 and 𝐽4 :
𝐽3 ( 𝑝(·)) =
𝐽4 ( 𝑝(·)) =

where maximizing 𝐽3 corresponds to minimizing the fraction of infected individuals

the main goal is to maximize the fraction of recovered individuals, by treatment, and,
at the same time, minimize the fraction of infected individuals with less treatment
cost as possible.
Finally, when both controls are considered simultaneously, modelled by the vaccination and plasma transfusion based control system (4), the objective functional
considered to be maximized was 𝐽5 :

with the main goal to minimize the fraction of infected individuals and the costs
associated with vaccination and plasma transfusion treatment.
Associated to each of the cost functionals 𝐽𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 5, we propose an optimal control problem of determining the state trajectories (𝑠∗ (·), 𝑒 ∗ (·), 𝑖 ∗ (·), 𝑟 ∗ (·)),
associated to an admissible control 𝑢 ∗ (·) ∈ Ω and/or 𝑝 ∗ (·) ∈ Ω on the time interval
[0, 𝑇], satisfying one of the control systems (2)–(4), as explained, the initial conditions (6), and maximizing the corresponding functional. The five optimal control
problems are denoted by (𝑂𝐶𝑖 ), 𝑖 = 1, . . . 5, and are now summarized.

Note that all optimal control problems have a 𝐿 2 -cost functional, in other words,
the integrand of the cost 𝐽𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 5, is always convex with respect to the
controls 𝑢 and 𝑝. Moreover, the control systems (2)–(4) are Lipschitz with respect
to the state variables (𝑠, 𝑒, 𝑖, 𝑟). These properties ensure the existence of an optimal
control (𝑢 ∗ (·), 𝑝 ∗ (·)) for the optimal control problems (𝑂𝐶1 )–(𝑂𝐶5 ). Moreover,
we apply the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (see, e.g., [18]), which is a first order
necessary optimality condition. The obtained result, here formulated and proved for
the optimal control problem (𝑂𝐶1 ), can be trivially extended to the other optimal
control problems (𝑂𝐶𝑖 ), 𝑖 = 2, . . . , 5.

with the transversality conditions 𝜆𝑖 (𝑇) = 0, 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 4.
Proof The existence of an optimal control 𝑢 ∗ (·) of the optimal control problem
(𝑂𝐶1 ) is due to the convexity of the 𝐿 2 -cost functional 𝐽1 and to the fact that the
vaccinated based control system (2) is Lipschitz with respect to the state variables
(𝑠, 𝑒, 𝑖, 𝑟): see, e.g., [6]. The uniqueness of the optimal control 𝑢 ∗ comes from
the boundedness of the state and adjoint functions and the Lipschitz property of
system (2) (see [9, 26] and references cited therein). According to the Pontryagin
Maximum Principle, if 𝑢 ∗ (·) is optimal for the problem (𝑂𝐶1 ) with fixed final time
𝑇, then there exists a nontrivial absolutely continuous mapping Λ : [0, 𝑇] → R4 ,
Λ(𝑡) = (𝜆1 (𝑡), 𝜆2 (𝑡), 𝜆3 (𝑡), 𝜆4 (𝑡)), called the adjoint vector, such that

To solve optimal control problems numerically, two approaches are possible:
direct and indirect. Indirect methods are based on Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle
but not very much widespread since they are not immediately available by software
packages. We refer the reader to [4] for the implementation of Pontryagin’s Maximum
Principle using Octave/MATLAB. Direct methods consist in the discretization of the
optimal control problem, reducing it to a nonlinear programming problem [15, 20].
In the next section, we use the Applied Modeling Programming Language AMPL [8]
to discretize the optimal control problems (𝑂𝐶𝑖 ), 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 5. Then, the resulting
nonlinear programming problems are solved using the Interior-Point optimization
solver developed by Wächter and Biegler [29], through the NEOS Server [16]. For
more details on the numerical aspects see [25].

4 Numerical simulations and results
In this section, we provide numerical simulations for the solutions of the optimal
control problems (𝑂𝐶𝑖 ), 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 5, proposed in Section 3. The following values
for the initial conditions are considered:
𝑠(0) = 0.88 ,

𝑒(0) = 0.07 ,

𝑖(0) = 0.05 ,

𝑟 (0) = 0 ,

(14)

Optimal control of vaccination and plasma transfusion

and the parameter values
𝛽 = 0.3 ,

𝛾 = 0.1887 ,

𝜇 = 0.1 .

(15)

The initial conditions (14) were chosen arbitrarily, considering an hypothetical situation where 88% of the total population is susceptible to the disease and there is
a relatively small percentage of infected population and no recovered individuals.
The parameter values are chosen in such a way that model (1) simulates an epidemic
outbreak, caused by a communicable disease. Moreover, we consider the control constraints with 𝑢 max = 0.5 and 𝑝 max = 0.3, that is, the admissible controls (𝑢, 𝑝) ∈ Ω
must satisfy 0 ≤ 𝑢(𝑡) ≤ 0.5 and 0 ≤ 𝑝(𝑡) ≤ 0.3 for all 𝑡 ∈ [0, 𝑇].
All computations have been performed with an Intel i7-4720HQ 2.60GHz processor, 8 GB of RAM, and an SSD disk of 128 GB under Windows 10, Home Edition
of 64 bits.

4.1 The 𝒔𝒆𝒊𝒓 model without controls
The 𝑠𝑒𝑖𝑟 model differential equations were integrated using the ode45 MATLAB
routine, which is based on an explicit Runge–Kutta method [23]. For the parameter
values (15), the dynamic evolution of the uncontrolled system (1) is described
in Figures 2–3. We observe that although the fraction of infected 𝑖 and exposed 𝑒
individuals tends to 0, after 100 units of time, more than 40 per cent of the population
recovered or was removed (possible died from the disease).

4.2 The 𝒔𝒆𝒊𝒓 model with controls
It is desirable to minimize the fraction of infected individuals that get infected by the
disease with minimal costs.

4.2.1 Optimal control problems (𝑶𝑪1 ) and (𝑶𝑪2 )
Firstly, we consider the effect of vaccinating the population at the first 20 time
units, aiming at maximizing 𝐽1 subject to the vaccination based control system (2),
the initial conditions (14), and the control constraint 0 ≤ 𝑢(𝑡) ≤ 0.5. The results
obtained are given in Figures 4 and 5.
We see that in both 𝑠𝑒𝑖𝑟 evolutions, the susceptible 𝑠 and recovered 𝑟 states seem
to interchange, as expected by the vaccination based control system (2). Further,
looking at the vaccination control 𝑢(·) evolution, it is possible to see that in both
Figures 4 and 5 its value starts at a maximum and then decays as time passes. This
makes sense, since at the beginning of the epidemic there are more susceptible
individuals 𝑠. Thus, it is expected that the rate of vaccination is larger at this time
in order to try to vaccinate the most susceptible individuals 𝑠 as possible before
they start getting infected. Further, comparing the vaccination control of Figure 4
and Figure 5, one can see that applying the condition of maximizing the fraction of

vaccination at its maximum for 3 units of time before starting to decay with a less
steeper slope than its analogue in 𝐽1 .

4.2.2 Optimal control problems (𝑶𝑪3 ) and (𝑶𝑪4 )
Regarding the plasma transfusion treatment, one can see that, in contrast to the
vaccine control, here the control 𝑝(·) peaks later in time (see Figures 6 and 7).
Again, this is something that makes sense since, in order for the treatment to be
applied, there must be not only individuals in the infected 𝑖 state, that are able to
received the plasma, but also individuals in the recovered 𝑟 state, that are able to
donate the plasma. Evidently, these recovered individuals 𝑟 must have been in the
infected state 𝑖 before.
Because this is an intervention that presupposes that the disease has evolved for
some time, then a larger time window could allow one to visualize a stronger impact

in the fractions of the 𝑖 and 𝑟 states. That said, a simulation for optimal control
problems (𝑂𝐶3 ) and (𝑂𝐶4 ) is performed using 𝑇 = 100.
The simulation that made the control increase the most with the time change was
the one for the optimal control problem (𝑂𝐶3 ) (Figure 8). Further, the control peak
at Figure 8 also occurs before the control peak at Figure 9. This is expected since
(𝑂𝐶4 ) requires maximizing the 𝑟 state, which implies again that more individuals
must get into the 𝑖 state so that they can get into the 𝑟 state after recovering. It is also
interesting to note that, according to the (𝑂𝐶4 ) optimal control problem, one should
not proceed with plasma transfusion to any infected individual during the beginning
of the epidemic, in order to obtain the optimal control.

4.2.3 Optimal control problem (𝑶𝑪5 )
Finally, the combined effect of the two controls for the optimal control problem (𝑂𝐶5)
is presented in Figure 10. As expected, the peak of the vaccination rate occurs before
the peak of the plasma transfusion rate. Apparently, the results in minimizing the

fraction of individuals in the infected state 𝑖 are better, when comparing Figure 10a
with Figures 4a and 6a, but Figure 11 gives us a better understanding of the controls
effects in the 𝑠𝑒𝑖𝑟 dynamics. Figure 11 shows the effect of the controls in the
individual 𝑠, 𝑒, 𝑖, 𝑟 states. Since the main objective of the control functionals is
to minimize the number of individuals in the infected state 𝑖, then, by looking at
Figure 11c, one can see that the control that minimizes the 𝑖 fraction the most is
the conjugation of both vaccination and plasma transfusion. This is also an intuitive
result, since the vaccination makes more people jumping into the 𝑟 state, which
is the pool of individuals from where the plasma comes. On the other hand, the
plasma transfusion by itself seems to be the less effective control in minimizing
the infected fraction 𝑖 (Figure 11c). This is expected since, as explained above, the
plasma transfusion control needs more time to kick in the absence of a larger pool
of recovered individuals 𝑟.
Furthermore, if the aim is to maximize the recovered state 𝑟 or to minimize the
susceptible 𝑠 and exposed 𝑒 states, then the vaccination is the best control (Figure 11d), a result also predicted by system (2). By analysing the control comparison

at Figure 12, one can see that the control that benefits the most with the combined
approach of both vaccination and plasma transfusion is the plasma control. This can
be explained since one can think that if we apply vaccination in the beginning of the
epidemics, then the fraction of recovered individuals 𝑟 increases faster, providing a
bigger substract to do plasma transfusion sooner and at a higher rate.

All the optimal control simulations were carried out using NEOS Server 6.0, their
duration varying between 0.508 and 1.149 seconds, for 20 units of time, and between
24.431 and 30.702 seconds, for 100 units of time.

5 Discussion and conclusion
The 𝑠𝑒𝑖𝑟 model (1) was solved numerically in both uncontrolled and controlled
conditions. Of the controls employed, the combined action of vaccination and plasma
transfusion seems to have the higher impact in reducing the fraction of infectious
individuals. Moreover, the plasma transfusion acquires a more important role as the
fraction of individuals in the recovered state increases, which explains why whether
joining the vaccination or increasing the duration of the simulations leads to an
higher peak of the plasma transfusion rate. In fact, by joining the vaccination, one
can not only increase the plasma transfusion rate peak but also anticipate it.
To sum up, controls can act at different timings of the epidemics dynamics and
one control can be more adequate in the beginning of the epidemic whilst other
might be more appropriated in a later state.
