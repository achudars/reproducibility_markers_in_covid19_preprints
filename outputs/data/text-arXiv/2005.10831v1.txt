Abstract
There have been more than 850,000 confirmed cases and over 48,000 deaths
from the human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by
novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in the
United States alone. However, there are currently no proven effective
medications against COVID-19. Drug repurposing offers a promising way for
the development of prevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19. This
study reports an integrative, network-based deep learning methodology to
identify repurposable drugs for COVID-19 (termed CoV-KGE). Specifically, we
built a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 15 million edges across
39 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, genes, pathways, and
expressions, from a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications.
Using Amazon’s AWS computing resources, we identified 41 repurposable
drugs (including indomethacin, toremifene and niclosamide) whose
therapeutic association with COVID-19 were validated by transcriptomic and
proteomic data in SARS-CoV-2 infected human cells and data from ongoing
clinical trials. While this study, by no means recommends specific drugs, it
demonstrates a powerful deep learning methodology to prioritize existing
drugs for further investigation, which holds the potential of accelerating
therapeutic development for COVID-19.

Introduction
As of April 22, 2020, there have been more than 850,000 confirmed cases
and over 48,000 deaths from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the
disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, in the United States alone.1
However, there are currently no proven effective antiviral medications against
COVID-19.2 There is an urgent need for the development of effective
treatment strategies for COVID-19. Traditional de novo drug discovery was
estimated that pharmaceutical companies spent $2.6 billion in 2015 for the
development of an FDA-approved new chemical entity drug.3 Drug
repurposing, a drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, offers an
promising way for the development of prevention and treatment strategies for
COVID-19.4
In a randomized, controlled, open-label trial5, lopinavir and ritonavir
combination therapy did not show clinical benefit compared to standard care
for hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19, limiting the traditional
antiviral treatment for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection
depends on the host cellular factors (including angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2)) for entry into cells.6 Systematic identification of virus-host proteinprotein interactions (PPIs) offers an effective way towards elucidation of the
mechanisms of viral infection; furthermore, targeting cellular virus-host
interactome offers a promising strategy for the development of effective drug
repurposing for COVID-19 as demonstrated in previous studies.7-9 We
3

recently demonstrated that network-based methodologies leveraging
relationship between drug targets and diseases can serve as a useful tool for
efficient screening of potentially new indications for FDA-approved drugs with
well-established pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability
profiles.10-12 Yet, without foreknowledge of the complex networks connecting
drugs, targets, SARS-CoV-2 and diseases, development of affordable
approaches for effective treatment of COVID-19 is challenging.
Prior knowledge of networks from large scientific corpus of publications
offers a deep biological perspective for capturing the relationships between
drugs, genes and diseases (including COVID-19). Yet, extracting connections
from a large-scale repository of structured medical information is challenging.
In this study, we present the state-of-the-art knowledge graph-based, deep
learning methodologies for rapid discovery of drug candidates to treat COVID19 from 24 million PubMed publications. Via systematic validation using
transcriptomics and proteomics data generated from SARS-CoV-2 infected
human cells and the ongoing clinical trial data, we successfully identified 41
drug candidates that can be further tested in large-scale randomized control
trials for potential treatment of COVID-19.

Pipeline of CoV-KGE

Here we present a knowledge graph-based, deep learning methodology for
drug repurposing in COVID-19, termed CoV-KGE (Figure 1). Our method
uses DGL-KE, developed by our Amazon’s AWS AI Laboratory13, to efficiently
learn embeddings of large knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct a
knowledge graph from 24 million PubMed publications14 and DrugBank15,
including 15 million edges across 39 types of relationships connecting drugs,
diseases, genes, anatomies, pharmacologic classes, gene/protein expression,
and others (cf. Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). In this knowledge graph, we
represent the Coronaviruses (CoVs) by assembling multiple types of known
CoVs, including SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 as
described in our recent study9.
We next utilize DGL-KE’s knowledge graph embedding model, RotatE16,
to learn representations of the entities (e.g., drugs and targets) and
relationships (e.g., inhibition relation between drugs and targets) in an
informative, low-dimensional vector space. In this space, each relationship
type (e.g., antagonists or agonists) is defined as a rotation from the source
entity (e.g., hydroxychloroquine) to the target entity (e.g., toll-like receptor 7/9
(TLR7/9)) (cf. Methods).

High performance of CoV-KGE
After mapping drugs, CoVs, and the treatment relationships to a complex
vector space using RotatE, the top-100 most relevant drugs are selected as
5

candidate for CoVs in the treatment relation space (Supplementary Figure
1). Using the ongoing COVID-19 trial data (https://covid19-trials.com/) as a
validation set, CoV-KGE has the larger area under the receive operating
characteristic curve (AUROC = 0.85, Figure 2) in identifying repurposable
drugs for COVID-19.
We next employ t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
algorithm17) to further investigate the low-dimensional node representation
learned by CoV-KGE. Specifically, we project drugs grouped by the first-level
of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification systems code
onto two-dimensional space. Figure 3A indicates that CoV-KGE is able to
distinguish 14 types of drugs grouped by ATC codes, consistent with a high
AUROC value of 0.85 (Figure 2).
We further validate the top candidate drugs using enrichment analysis of
drug-gene signatures and SARS-CoV induced transcriptomics and proteomics
data in human cell lines (cf. Methods). Specifically, we analyzed three
transcriptomic datasets in SARS-CoV-1 infected human cell lines and one
proteomic dataset in SARS-CoV-2 infected human cell lines. In total, we
obtained 41 high-confidence repurposable drugs (Supplementary Table 3)
using subject matter expertise based on a combination of factors: (i) strength
of the CoV-KGE predicted score; (ii) availability of clinical evidence from
ongoing COVID-19 trials; (iii) availability and strength of enrichment analyses
from SARS-CoV-1/2 effected human cell lines. Among the 41 candidate
6

drugs, 11 drugs are or have been under clinical trials for COVID-19, including
thalidomide, methylprednisolone, ribavirin, umifenovir, chloroquine,
hydroxychloroquine, tetrandrine, suramin, dexamethasone, lopinavir,
azithromycin (Figure 3A and Supplementary Table 3). We next turn to
highlight three types of predicted drugs for COVID-19, including antiinflammatory agents, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and
antiparasitics (Figure 3A).

Discovery of drug candidates for COVID-19 using CoV-KGE
Given the well-described lung pathophysiological characteristics and immune
responses (cytokine storms) of severe COVID-19 patients, drugs that dampen
the immune responses may offer effective treatment approaches for COVID19.18, 19 As shown in Figure 3A, we computationally identified multiple antiinflammatory agents for COVID-19, including indomethacin and melatonin.
Indomethacin, an approved cyclooxygenases (COXs) inhibitor, has been
widely used for its potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties20.
Indomethacin has been reported to have antiviral properties, including SARSCoV-120, and SARS-CoV-221. Importantly, preliminary in vivo observation
showed that oral indomethacin (1 mg/kg body weight daily) reduced the
recovery time of SARS-CoV-2 infected dogs.21 Melatonin plays a key role in
the regulation of human circadian rhythm that alters the translation of
thousands of genes, including melatonin-mediated anti-inflammatory and
7

immune-related effects for COVID-19. Melatonin has various antiviral activities
by suppressing multiple inflammatory pathways22, 23 (including IL6, IL-1β, and
TNFα, etc.) -- these inflammatory effects are directly relevant given the welldescribed lung pathophysiological characteristics of severe COVID-19
patients. The melatonin’s mechanism-of-action may also help explain the
epidemiologic observation that children, who have naturally high melatonin
levels, are relatively resistant to COVID-19 disease manifestations, while
older individuals, who have decreasing melatonin levels with age, are a very
high-risk population.24 In addition, exogenous melatonin administration may
be of particular benefit to older patients given an aging-related reduction of
endogenous melatonin levels and vulnerability of older individuals to the
lethality of SARS-CoV-2.24
An overexpression of estrogen receptor has played a crucial role in
inhibiting viral replication and infection.25 Several selective estrogen receptor
modulators (SERMs), including clomifene, bazedoxifene, and toremifene, are
identified as promising candidate drugs for COVID-19 (Figure 3B).
Toremifene, the first generation of nonsteroidal SERM, was reported to block
various viral infections at low micromolar concentration, including Ebola
virus26, 27, MRES-CoV28, SARS-CoV-129, and SARS-CoV-230 (Figure 3A).
Toremifene prevents fusion between the viral and endosomal membrane by
interacting with and destabilizing the virus glycoprotein, and eventually
blocking replications of the Ebola virus.26 The underlying antiviral mechanisms
8

of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 for toremifene remains unclear and are
currently being investigated. Toremifene has been approved for the treatment
of advanced breast cancer31 and has also been studied in men with prostate
cancer (~1,500 subjects) with reasonable tolerability.32 Toremifene is 99%
bound to plasma protein with good bioavailability and typically administered at
a dosage of 60 mg orally.33 In summary, toremifene offers a promising
candidate drug with ideal pharmacokinetics properties to be tested in COVID19 clinical trials directly.
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate, two approved
antimalarial drugs, though lacking strong clinical evidence, were authorized by
the U.S. FDA for treatment of COVID-19 patients using emergency use
authorizations.2 In this study, we identified that both hydroxychloroquine and
chloroquine are among the predicted candidates for COVID-19 (Figure 3A).
Between the two, hydroxychloroquine’s in vitro antiviral activity against SARSCoV-2 is stronger than that of chloroquine (hydroxychloroquine: 50% effective
concentration (EC50) = 6.14 μM where chloroquine: EC50 = 23.90 μM)34.
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are known to increase the pH of
endosomes, which inhibits membrane fusion, a required mechanism for viral
entry (including SARS-CoV-2) into the cell19. Additionally, the potential benefit
of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients may be explained by both
antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects (Figure 3B). In vitro experiments
showed that hydroxychloroquine reduced the expression of vascular cell
9

adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and IL-1β and attenuates the suppression of
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) in human aortic endothelial cells.10
However, even though chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are relatively well
tolerated, several adverse effects (including QT prolongation) limit its clinical
use for COVID-19 patients, especially for patients with pre-existing
cardiovascular disease or diabetes.10, 35-37 These findings suggest that
hydroxychloroquine have both anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity for
COVID-19 therapy but its safety and efficacy needs to be tested in large-scale
randomized control trials. In addition, niclosamide, an FDA-approved drug for
treatment of tapeworm infestation, was recently identified to have a stronger
inhibitory activity on SARS-CoV-2 at sub-micromolar (IC50 = 0.28 µM). Gassen
et al. showed that niclosamide inhibited SKP2 activity by enhancing
autophagy and reducing MERS-CoV replication as well.38 Altogether,
niclosamide offers another promising drug candidate for COVID-19, which is
warranted to be investigated in randomized controlled trials further.
Finally, given the up-regulation of systemic inflammation—in some
cases culminating to a cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19
patients40—combination therapy with an agent targeting inflammation
(melatonin or indomethacin) and with direct antiviral effects (toremifene and
niclosamide) has the potential of leading to successful treatments.

Discussion
10

As COVID-19 patients flood hospitals worldwide, physicians are trying to
search effective antiviral therapies to save lives. Multiple COVID-19 vaccine
trials are under way; yet, it might not be physically possible to make enough
vaccine for everyone in a short period of time. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2
replicates poorly in multiple animals, including dogs, pigs, chickens, and
ducks, which limits preclinical animal studies39.
In this study, we present CoV-KGE, a powerful, integrated AI
methodology that can be used to quickly identify drugs that can be
repurposed for the potential treatment of COVID-19. Our approach can
minimize the translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical
outcomes, which is a significant problem in the rapid development of efficient
treatment strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic. From a translational
perspective, if broadly applied, the network tools developed here could help
develop effective treatment strategies for other emerging infectious diseases
and other emerging complex diseases as well.

Methods and Materials
Constructing the knowledge graph
In this study, we constructed a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG) from
GNBR14 and DrugBank41. First, from GNBR, we included in the KG relations
corresponding to drug-gene interactions, gene-gene interactions, drugdisease associations, and gene-disease associations. Second, from
11

DrugBank, we selected the drugs whose molecular mass is greater than 230
daltons and also exist in GNBR—resulting in 3,481 FDA-approved and
clinically investigational drugs. For these drugs, we included in the KG
relationships corresponding to the drug-drug interactions, and the drug-sideeffects, drug ATC codes, drug-mechanism-of-action, drug-pharmacodynamics,
and drug-toxicity associations. Third, we included the experimentally
discovered coronaviruses-gene relationships from our recent work in the KG.9
Fourth, we treated the COVID-19 context by assembling six types of
Coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoVNL63) as a comprehensive node of Coronaviruses (CoVs), and rewired the
connections (edges) from genes and drugs. The resulting KG contains four
types of entities (drug, gene, disease, and drug side information), 39 types of
relationships (Supplementary Table 1), 145,179 nodes, and 15,018,067
edges (Supplementary Table 2).

The knowledge graph embedding model RotatE
Models for computing knowledge graph embeddings learn vectors for each of
the entities and each of the relation types so that they satisfy certain
properties. In our work we learned these vectors using the RotatE model.42
Given an edge in the knowledge graph represented by the triplet (head-entity,
relation-type, and tail-entity), RotatE defines each relation type as a rotation
from the head entity to tail entity in the complex vector space. Specifically, if
12

ℎ, # are the vectors corresponding to the head and tail entities, respectively
and $ is the vector corresponding to the relation type, RotaE tries to minimize
the distance
%& (ℎ, #) = *|ℎ ∘ $ − #|*

(1)

where ∘ denotes the Hadamard (element-wise) product.
In order to minimize the distance between the head and the tail entities
of the existing triplets (positive examples) and maximize the distance among
the non-existing triples (negative examples), we use the loss function
L = −log σ4γ − %& (h, t)8 − ∑>;?@ :(ℎ; , $, #; ) log <(%& (ℎ; , #; ) − =)

(2)

where σ is sigmoid function, γ is a margin hyperparameter with γ > 0,
(ℎ; , $, #; ) is a negative triplet, and :(ℎ; , $, #; ) is the probability of occurrence of
the corresponding negative sample.

Details of DGL-KE package
DGL-KE43 is a high performance, easy-to-use, and scalable package for
learning large-scale knowledge graph embeddings with a set of popular
models including TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, and RotatE. It includes various
optimizations that accelerate training on knowledge graphs with millions of
nodes and billions of edges using multi-processing, multi-GPU, and
distributed parallelism. DGL-KE is able to compute the RotatE-based
embeddings of our knowledge graph in around 40 minutes on an EC2
instance with 8 GPUs under Amazon’s AWS computing resources.
13

Experimental Settings
We divide the triplets (e.g., a relationship among drug, treatment, and
disease) into training set, validation set, and test set in a 7:1:2 manner. We
selected the embedding dimensionality of dim=200 for nodes and relations.
The RotatE is trained for 16000 epochs with batch size 1024 and 0.1 as the
learning rate. We choose γ = 12 as the margin of the optimization function in
Supplementary Note 2.

Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis
We performed the gene set enrichment analysis to further validate the
predicted drug candidates from CoV-KGE. We first collected three differential
gene expression data sets of human cell lines infected by HCoVs from the
Gene Expression Omnibus database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
Specifically, two transcriptome datasets from SARS-CoV infected patient’s
peripheral blood 44 (GSE1739) and Calu-3 cells 45 (GSE33267) were used.
One transcriptome data set of MERS-CoV infected Calu-3 cells 46
(GSE122876) was selected. In addition, one SARS-CoV-2 specific proteomic
dataset was collected from a website: https://biochem2.com/index.php/22ibcii/pqc/130-frontpage-pqc#coronavirus. Adjusted P value less than 0.01 was
defined as differentially expressed genes/proteins. Differential gene
expression in cells treated with various drugs were retrieved from the
14

Connectivity Map (CMap) database47, and were used as gene profiles for the
drugs. We calculated an enrichment score (ES) for each CoV signature
dataset using a previously described method 48:
EF = G

EFHI − EFJKL> , MNO(EFHI ) ≠ MNO(EFJKL> )
0, QRMQ

(3)

EFHI and EFJKL> are calculated separately for the up- and down-regulated
genes from the CoV gene signature dataset. We computed SHI/JKL> and
UHI/JKL> as:
Z

S = max \[ −
@YZY[

U = max \
@YZY[

](Z)
&

](Z)
&

−

^

Z_@
[

(4)
^

(5)

where ` = 1,2, ⋯ , M are the genes of HCoV signature dataset sorted in
ascending order by their rank in the gene profiles of the drug being computed.
The rank of gene ` is denoted by b(`), where 1 ≤ b(`) ≤ $, with $ being the
number of genes (12,849) from the CMap database. Then, EFHI/JKL> is set
to SHI/JKL> if SHI/JKL> > UHI/JKL> , and is set to −UHI/JKL> if UHI/JKL> >
SHI/JKL> . To quantify the significance of the ES scores, permutation tests are
repeated 100 times using randomly generated gene lists with the same
number of up- and down-regulated genes as the CoV signature data set.
Drugs are considered to have significantly enriched effect if ES > 0 and P <
0.05.

Performance Evaluation

15

We introduced the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve (AUROC) several evaluation metrics for evaluating performance of
drug-target interaction prediction. The area under the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC)49 is the global prediction performance.
The ROC curve is obtained by calculating the true positive rate (TPR) and the
false positive rate (FPR) via varying cutoff.

methodology (termed CoV-KGE) for drug repurposing in COVID-19.
Specifically, a comprehensive knowledge graph that contains 15 million edges
across 39 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, genes,
pathways, and expressions, and others by incorporating data from 24 million
PubMed publications (Supplemental Table S2). Subsequently, a deep learning
approach (RotatE in DGL-KE) was used to prioritize high-confidence
candidate drugs for COVID-19 under Amazon supercomputing resources (cf.
Methods section). Finally, all CoV-KGE predicted drug candidates were future
validated by three gene expression datasets in SARS-CoV-1 infected human
cells and one proteomic data in SARS-CoV-2 infected human cells.

Figure 2. The performance of CoV-KGE in predicting of drug canidates for
COVID-19. Drugs under the ongoing COVID-19 trial data (https://covid19trials.com/) were used as the validation set. AUROC: the area under the ROC
curve.

Figure 3. A diagram illustrating the landscape of CoV-KGE predicted
repurposable drugs for COVID-19. (A) Visualization of the drug vector learned
by knowledge graph embedding using the t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic
neighbor embedding algorithm17). The two-dimensional (2D) representation of
the learned vectors for 14 types of drugs grouped by the first-level of the
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system codes.

Semantically similar ATC drugs are mapped to nearby representations. We
highlight the 11 drugs which are under clinical trials for COVID-19 and 3
experimentaly drugs (toremifine, niclosamide and indomethasin) having
striking in vitro antiviral activitities across Ebola virus26, 27, MRES-CoV28,
SARS-CoV-129, and SARS-CoV-230. (B) A proposed mechanism-of-action of
hydroxychloroquine in potential treatment of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine
has both anti-inflammatory10 and antiviral activity34. Given the up-regulation of
systemic inflammation (e.g., cytokine storms) observed in severe COVID-19
patients40, combination therapy with antiviral agents (toremifene or
niclosamide) and with anti-inflammatoray agents (melatonin or indomethacin)
may offer promising treatment approach for COVID-19, which is warranted to
be tested in the randomized controlled trials further.
