Abstract: The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for cheap reusable
personal protective equipment. The disinfection properties of Ultraviolet (UV) radiation
in the 200-300 nm have been long known and documented. Many solutions using UV radiation, such as cavity disinfection and whole room decontamination between uses, are in
use in various industries, including healthcare. Here we propose a portable wearable device
which can safely, efficiently and economically, continuously disinfect inhaled/exhaled air
using UV radiation with possible 99.99% virus elimination. We utilize UV radiation in the
260 nm range where no ozone is produced, and because of the self-contained UV chamber,
there would be no UV exposure to the user. We have optimized the cavity design such that
an amplification of 10-50 times the irradiated UV power may be obtained. This is crucial
in ensuring enough UV dosage is delivered to the air flow during breathing. Further, due to
the turbulent nature of airflow, a series of cavities is proposed to ensure efficient actual disinfection. The Personal Ultraviolet Respiratory Germ Eliminating Machine (PURGEM)
can be worn by people or attached to devices such as ventilator exhausts/intakes, or be
used free-standing as a portable local air disinfection unit, offering modularity with multiple
avenues of usage. Patent pending.

Introduction

Current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for cheap reusable personal protective equipment. In particular, recent studies [1, 2] showing the stability (& 16 hours) of
aerosolized SARS-COV-2 make air disinfection one of the highest current priorities.
The disinfection properties of Ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the 200-300 nm have been
long known and documented. Many solutions using UV radiation, such as cavity disinfection and whole room decontamination between uses, are in use in various industries,
including healthcare. Here we propose a portable wearable device which can safely, efficiently and economically, continuously disinfect inhaled/exhaled air using UV radiation
with possible 99.99% virus elimination. We utilize UV radiation in the 260 nm range where
no ozone is produced, and because of the self-contained UV chamber, there would be no
UV exposure to the user. We have optimized the cavity design such that an amplification of
10-50 times the irradiated UV power may be obtained. This is crucial in ensuring enough
UV dosage is delivered to the air flow during breathing. Further, due to the turbulent
nature of airflow, a series of cavities is proposed to ensure efficient actual disinfection. The
Personal Ultraviolet Respiratory Germ Eliminating Machine (PURGEM) can be worn by
people or attached to devices such as ventilator exhausts or be used free-standing as a
portable local air disinfection unit, offering multiple avenues of usage.
The elimination of an organism due to UV radiation is highly dose dependent. There
has been a great deal of investigation on the optimal dose required, showing a huge range
of efficacious dosages administered (See for e.g. Ref. [3] and references within). However,
investigating these studies, we found that there were sometimes confounding factors leading
to inconsistent results. We found that the most pertinent investigations were carried out in
Refs. [4–8]. Most recently, Ref. [8] showed that 222 nm UV radiation is able to inactivate
various coronaviruses to the 3-log level with a dose of . 2 mJ/cm2 . Previously, Ref. [7]
showed that the H1N1 virus requires a dose of 4 mJ/cm2 to give a 4-log (99.99%) reduction
using 222 nm radiation. In Ref. [5] it was shown that irradiation by 254 nm UV provided
similar elimination of H1N1. For the Murine Hepatitis Virus coronavirus, a similar dose

–1–

requirement was found when irradiated with 254 nm UV [4]. In previous work, the authors
of Ref. [7, 8] have shown that 254 nm and 222 nm radiation gives similar results for
bacterial targets [6], even though the precise cause of elimination is different [9]. Very
recently, a preliminary study shows that a 3-log reduction for SARS-COV2 may be obtained
for similar values of 3.7 mJ/cm2 [10]. This result is inline with expectations due to the
structural similarities in the various viruses. For the long term user, one would optimally
want enough UV radiation to also eliminate bacteria and fungal pathogens, which seems to
require an order of magnitude larger dose for similar disinfection levels [3]. However, due
to the larger size of bacteria/fungi compared to viruses, bacteria/fungi tend to get filtered
very efficiently with even low quality fabric masks. Hence, it may be more efficient to
consider a reusable, washable filter in conjunction with UV disinfection to provide optimal
protection from all pathogens.
There are many UV sources available commercially in a wide range of both power
and wavelength. While Mercury based cold cathode lamps (CCL) are cheaper currently,
LEDs have been dramatically reducing in price, and with the UN Minamata Convention
on Mercury [11], it is expected that mercury lamps will get phased out soon. Additionally,
LED lifetimes are between 10 - 20,000 hrs. Current LED pricing for 250-280 nm wavelength
. $0.2/mW [12, 13]. Further, peak germicidal efficiency has long been considered to be 254
nm, but this is because 254 nm corresponds to the highest peak of the mercury spectrum.
However, it is well known that the peak absorbance of RNA/DNA is at 260 nm. Hence,
it stands to reason that higher elimination efficiency may be achieved via irradiation of
viruses and bacteria closer to 260 nm, a wavelength that can be achieved if using LEDs
rather than mercury based lamps.
The challenge in any device proposing to continuously disinfect air is to ensure the
practical delivery of the required UV dosage given the rate of air flow dictated by a person
breathing while being economically feasible. The average rate of air inhaled/exhaled under
light to moderate exertion is ∼ 20 liters/minutes [14–16], giving a volume flow rate of
VF = 333 cm3 /s. The dose delivery of any such device is proportional to the power of
the UV source, PU V , and inversely proportional to VF . In the PURGEM we optimize
the geometry of the UV cavity such that the dose delivered by a UV source of power PU V
is significantly enhanced due to multiple reflections inside the chamber, and show that a
nominal dose of 4 mJ/cm2 for VF of air can be practically delivered with a 20 mW UV
LED. Further, due to the turbulent nature of airflow, a series of cavities is proposed such
that the actual efficient disinfection may be obtained. Details of disinfection obtained in
series and prototype development will be presented in a companion publication [17].
We consider that the largest size contraption that could be practically carried/strapped
to a person for long periods of time not exceed 20 cm × 20 cm × 40 cm, and must be
lightweight. We envision that the PURGEM will be hooked up to either a hood or a
helmet, examples of these are shown in Fig. 1, but could be connected to a sealed mask if
desired. A reasonable and cheap air seal may be obtained for example by using fashion tape
or a velcro strap on the head piece appropriately. There will be low power fans blowing air
to and from the UV chamber, so there doesn’t need to be a completely air tight seal around

the face as long as positive pressure is maintained. 1 This makes this system continuously
usable for long periods of time comfortably. All exposed surfaces of the PURGEM system
should be smooth, so can be easily cleaned by wiping with standard disinfecting solutions.
In this article we propose a schematic for the PURGEM UV chamber optimizing for
practical considerations listed above. The PURGEM can be configured as 1-way or 2-way
air flow, corresponding to disinfecting only one way, or both inhalation and exhalation.
For the same power delivered, this offers a trade-off between UV dose versus in and out
disinfection. The next section details the PURGEM UV chamber design which can be
simply manufactured. We reserve Sec. 3 for discussion, summarizing our designs and next
steps. The Appendix lists various possible sources for materials required.

The PURGEM

The crucial observation we make and utilize in our UV disinfection chamber design is the
fact that effectively infinite reflections of light inside the chamber significantly enhance the
initial UV source power irradiating air flow through the cavity. This is achieved practically
by ensuring that the interior surface of the cavity is spherical and made of high reflectance
material.
We consider the minimal possible average dose that could be received by air in the
time duration of the air flow through the disinfection cavity, including an enhancement
factor Ecav due to reflections:
Dmin =

Ecav PU V Vcav
,
Airrad VF

(2.1)

If used with sealed mask, fan assembly may not be necessarily required, however, the comfort level of
the user would be reduced. Additionally, some sort of ventilation system may be needed to prevent CO2
buildup [20].

–3–

where Airrad is the maximum surface area that PU V irradiates, and Vcav is the volume of
the cavity. Clearly to maximize Dmin , one wants to minimize Airrad for some given Vcav .
For an isotropic diffuse source, the initial power irradiating a given surface in a cavity
will generically get suppressed by 1/d2 , where d is the distance from the source. A sphere
minimizes the surface area given a volume, and is the geometry used in our model. We
note here that a cylinder of radius r and height 2r (or vice versa) and a cube of side 2r
would have the same Vcav /Airrad as a sphere of radius r. However, the radiation density in
a cylinder or cube compared to a sphere is not expected to be as uniform for a point source
such as a UV LED, but may be comparable for a line source such as that provided by a
CCL. Detailed computer simulations would need to be performed to verify precise dosage
in a non-spherical cavity.
We envision the air flow ports in the UV chamber to be small compared to the surface
area of the cavity. Hence we expect that the irradiation of air as it flows through the
spherical cavity should be mostly uniform given VF and the size of the UV chamber.
Finally, average travel time for a given air volume does not translate into actual UV
power dose received leading to pathogen elimination directly. Instead one needs to compute
the expectation value for disinfection using a weighted probability distribution for travel
times through the cavity. Details will be provided in companion publication on prototype
development [17].
2.1

The Model

A schematic of the PURGEM is shown in Fig. 2. A spherical cavity, made of high
reflectance (diffuse) material is the main UV chamber. As an example material, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) [21] is a widely and cheaply available UV resistant material with
> 95% reflectance [22]. Due to the high reflectance and spherical shape, the irradiance
is expected to be uniform throughout the sphere. A UV LED is mounted on the side,
irradiating the entire sphere. There are several air inlets and outlets clustered at the two
poles, configured to be furthest away from each other to optimize diffuse air flow through
the chamber. In case of using loose fitting hoods, it may be also be desirable to have
multiple fan speeds, such that the air flow rate may be changed depending on the exertion
level of the user. Of course this would reduce the dose for the same power source, since
the minimal dose administered, Eq. 2.1, is inversely proportional to VF . The input fan assembly may include a tight-weave cloth filter covering the opening to the chamber, acting
primarily as a particulate filter [23]. More sophisticated particulate filters may be used if
desired. This fan assembly would be removable, and the cloth filter can be simply washed
in soap and water as needed. PTFE is highly dust repellent, so there is unlikely to be dust
build up inside the chamber, however, there could be a UV sensor in the chamber which
would alert the user if there is reduced UV dosage in case of dust buildup or LED failure.
Alternatively, a current sensor could be incorporated into the circuit design which alerts
the user to current flow below a certain level, indicating LED/fan failure or low battery.
The UV chamber can be opened, so that in case of dust buildup, it can be cleaned out for
example with ethanol. For safety purposes, there would be sensors such that the device
will be inoperable when either the UV cavity or air flow vents are exposed. It would be

optimal if the air ports could be sealed off when the device is not in use to minimize dust
accumulation within UV chamber. Finally, all components should be enclosed within a
smooth cavity.
Due to the reflectance of the walls, one gets a geometric enhancement factor for the
UV power. This is reduced by any defects in the reflecting surface, such as those due to
the surface area occupied by the LED and the air vents. Therefore, the effective reflectance
Ref f of the cavity is given by:

Ref f = R

SAs
where R is the reflectance of the walls, SAs = 4πr2 is the surface area of the sphere of
radius r, and Adef is the total area of defects. Practically one should limit Adef to be less
than ∼ 5% of SAs . The enhancement due to effectively infinite reflections of light inside
the cavity gives a multiplicative factor to PU V :

where Vs = 43 πr3 is the volume of the sphere. We see that Ds is proportional to the r.

VF = 333 cm3 /s, PU V = 20 mW, Ref f = 0.95 (Es = 20), r = 10 cm,

(2.5)

Ds = 4 mJ/cm2 .

(2.6)

The spherical shape of the diffuse model provides excellent spatial integration. Since
there are minimal radiation hot or cold spots, the UV dose received by in-passing air
volume becomes effectively independent of path taken through the sphere. However, travel
time distributions, not average time, must be taken into account to accurately predict
actual disinfection, and in general will reduce the actual pathogen elimination significantly.
We note that having a series of spheres will effectively integrate the paths temporally,
allowing for the achievement of much higher levels of actual disinfection. Taking into
account the travel time distribution function, a series of n spheres with the same total
linear dimensions (radius r/n) as compared to a single sphere (radius r) and same total UV
power source would significantly reduce footprint of the device as well as material costs of
cavities. Details are be provided in companion publication on prototype development [17].

Discussion

The PURGEM can provide safe, practical, economically feasible, continuous personal
disinfection of air for ∼ 99.99% of viral particles. Disinfection from UV has been shown to
be efficacious for a wide range of wavelengths for a whole host of organisms. The crucial and
novel part of our design is the possible 10-50 times amplification of the initial UV source
power in a cavity. Further, a series of cavities will provide sufficient dosage to be delivered
to air flow while breathing, allowing effective actual pathogen elimination. LEDs in the
265 nm wavelength may be optimal economically due to ease of availability. Currently UV
LEDs of up to ∼100 mW are commercially available for such wavelengths. Mercury based
CCLs are significantly cheaper, being easily available for powers ∼1 W for the same price
point.
The UV cavities proposed here may be manufactured using several different ideas. We
first note that high precision cavity tolerances are not required such as would be needed for
precision integrating spheres used for optical power measurements. As long as the cavities
are not severely deformed, small surface imperfections should approximately average out
and the UV dose delivered to flowing air should be approximately uniform. Aluminum
cavities can be easily made at low costs but would only give factors of ∼ 3 enhancement
in power. Our goal here is to get enhancement factors of & O(10) in an economically
feasible way. As mentioned before, PTFE has a reflectivity & 95% at the wavelengths
we are considering, corresponding to an enhancement factor of & 20. PTFE is a depth

–6–

reflector rather than a surface reflector. However, only ∼ 0.024 g/cm2 or a 0.1 mm deep
layer of virgin PTFE is required for achieving optimal reflectivity [24, 25]. Thin tapes
and sheets of PTFE are easily and cheaply available commercially. PTFE membranes
may also be used [26]. These have a higher reflectance, but require a thicker layer, ∼ 2
mm, to achieve optimal reflectance. These can be cut to size and then layered inside any
cavity which is either cheaply available commercially, or manufactured via 3D printing.
Alternatively, the cavities may be coated with other high UV reflectance coatings such as
compounds containing Barium Sulphate, which may potentially allow for an even higer
reflectance [24, 27–29]. All other materials (fans, UV sensors etc.) are easily and cheaply
available. Finally, considering the power consumption from the UV sources and fans, we
estimate that this system could be powered using a standard rechargeable 10 Ah 5V power
bank, providing between 5-8 hours of continuous usage depending on precise power ratings
of components. We list some possible material resources in the Appendix.
We have presented a benchmark configuration with a computed dosage nominally
corresponding to 4-log reduction of the H1N1 virus. However, a series of such cavities will
be required to provide such actual elimination [17]. Recent work supports that dosages for
SARS-COV2 may be similar to H1N1. The benchmark cavities were configured to be the
maximal dimensions that we imagine could be practically worn, and doses computed using
the minimal power required to give the needed virus elimination for minimal air flow rate VF
we thought acceptable [15]. For the model proposed, the computed dosages scale linearly
with the largest dimension of the cavity and the UV power. With similar sized cavities as
we propose, a UV source of 10 times the power may be needed to give similar elimination
of other pathogens (bacterial or fungal). Given the low cost of both LEDs and CCLs, such
power requirements do not seem problematic. However, a reusable particulate filter may
provide more efficient elimination of such organisms. For the configuration presented, 2way airflow may be converted to 1-way if needed, providing a a higher level of disinfection.
Finally, a series of cavities (comparing same total linear dimension and power) may provide
a significant enhancement in actual virus elimination considering travel time distributions
through UV cavities, as well as reducing fingerprint and material cost of cavities [17].
There are many UV disinfection solutions being used commercially, specially in the
healthcare industry, such as decontamination cavities and whole room irradiation between
uses. Recently it has been proposed that 222 nm radiation could be used for the later
purpose without endangering the occupants [6–8]. However, such measures are only effective on the areas directly exposed; UV radiation is generally very easily absorbed by
any obstructions. While personal protective equipment has always been a need in the
healthcare industry, the current situation is exacerbated by their conventionally disposable
nature, dictated by the need for infection control and degradation of particulate filters
over use. We present a personal protection solution which is safe, reusable and requires
minimal maintenance, while providing superior protection. We estimate the price-point
for the PURGEM system (including minimal hood/helmet) produced commercially to be
∼ O($100). Single-use N95 masks cost ∼$1-5 each; while N95 masks can be decontaminated with UVC, they degrade rapidly [30], leading to a poorer fit and higher possibility
of virus transmission. Hence the economical feasibility of this device is immediately obvi-

–7–

ous. The PURGEM can be deployed in the healthcare industry as well as in the common
population, allowing society to resume its functionality safely. This is of paramount importance right now, given that even with promising preliminary results for a vaccine for
COVID-19 [31, 32], efficient population vaccination is not expected for & 1 year.
