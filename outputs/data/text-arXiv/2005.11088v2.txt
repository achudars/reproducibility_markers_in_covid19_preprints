Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, represents an unprecedented global
health challenge. Consequently, a large amount of research into the disease pathogenesis
and potential treatments has been carried out in a short time frame. However, developing
novel drugs is a costly and lengthy process, and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for
the pandemic. Drug repurposing, by contrast, provides an attractive alternative, as existing
drugs have already undergone many of the regulatory requirements. ​In this work we
demonstrate an approach to drug repurposing using a combination of probabilistic and
semantically rich networks. This combination, together with clustering algorithms, facilitates
both the use of network algorithms and distributed human curation, to search integrated
knowledge

graphs,

identifying

drug repurposing opportunities for COVID-19. We

demonstrate the value of this approach, reporting on eight potential repurposing
opportunities identified, and discuss how this approach could be incorporated into future
studies.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, was discovered in Wuhan, China, in
December 2019 ​[1]​. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the betacoronaviruses, a genus of
enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. The symptom profile of COVID-19
infections vary, with a dry cough and fever most often reported ​[2] and resulting in a mild
illness in most cases. However, severe illness has been reported as occurring in as many as
20% of laboratory-confirmed infections ​[3]​, depending on population demographics and
country-specific testing protocols, with symptoms including acute myocardial injury ​[4] and

2

acute kidney injury ​[5]​. Two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses are known ​[6]​:
SARS-CoV-1, responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004, and the Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, responsible for the MERS outbreak in 2012.
Unlike SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, however, SARS-CoV-2 is widely reported to cause
asymptomatic carriage ​[7] in some individuals, which has contributed to the rapid, global
spread ​[8]​, and subsequent radical, world-wide restrictions on daily life to control
transmission. The disease now represents an unprecedented global health challenge.

Mechanism of infection
Understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis is a piecemeal process. One process that
is particularly well understood is the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, which occurs via
two major methods: TMPRSS2-dependent entry and TMPRSS2-independent entry ​[9]​. The
first method relies on two human transmembrane proteins, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. The spike
proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which mediate coronavirus entry to human cells, have been shown
to have strong affinity for the human protein ACE2, which is highly expressed on the surface
of different cell types, including lung epithelial cells and type II alveolar cells ​[10]​. Once the
viral spike proteins have bound to ACE2, localised TMPRSS2 can activate the viral spike
proteins and cleave the cytoplasm-facing domain of ACE2. This mechanism causes the
virus’ membrane to fuse with the human cell’s membrane, allowing the viral genomic RNA to
enter the cell, where it can replicate and facilitate the production of new virions.
In the absence of localised TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV-2 can enter human cells expressing
ACE2 via another mechanism. In this process, the viral spike proteins bind to ACE2 and the
ACE2 receptor protein recruits clathrin, which initiates endocytosis of the virus. Usually,
following endocytosis, proton pumps transport H​+ ions into endosomes, lowering the internal
pH, allowing the endosome to begin the process of becoming an endolysosome and
breaking down anything within. However, the pH-dependent enzyme cathepsin L present in

3

endosomes are used by SARS-CoV-2 to activate the viral spike proteins, which allow the
virus to fuse with the endosomal membrane and release its genomic RNA into the host cell
in preparation for replication and production of more virions.

Repurposing drugs for the treatment of COVID-19
Due to the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases, a large amount of research into the disease
pathogenesis and potential treatment has been carried out in a short space of time. Given
the rapid onset of the pandemic, there is an urgent need to identify new drugs that are able
to treat the disease and improve patient outcomes ​[11,12]​. Developing novel drugs and
taking them to market typically takes many years, so the traditional pathways are unlikely to
provide a timely treatment for the current pandemic. The time pressures for new treatments
make drug repurposing particularly attractive. Drugs approved for one indication (disease)
may also happen to be efficacious for another. If likely candidates for repurposing can be
identified, the time to approval for a drug can be reduced to just a few months by drawing
from the pool of the many thousands of drugs that have already been through the regulatory
approval process, and are therefore well-characterised. Identifying high quality drug
repurposing candidates is challenging. Many discoveries are serendipitous, for example from
observations in clinics and trials ​[13]​. However, with the advent of network approaches to
studying biology at a systems level, new computational approaches have emerged that allow
a more systematic approach to drug repurposing ​[14–16]​. Networks are a convenient
method to represent drugs, genes, proteins, diseases, etc., and the relationships between
them. They support human investigation through visual exploration, while at the same time
being amenable to computational analysis, enabling automated and systematic analysis.

Drug repurposing algorithms derive new relationships between drugs, targets, diseases,
genes etc., based on existing knowledge of these relationships ​[15]​, These new relationships

4

can lead to hypotheses about novel repurposing opportunities and the evidence for them can
be reviewed and then hypotheses tested in the laboratory and clinic. Computational drug
repurposing prediction and human curation both require the availability of a variety of data
sources that describe the molecular processes in a cell and their interaction with drugs.
These data are typically distributed in a range of different data sources and databases and
may be integrated after they have been represented as networks to form an integrated
network or knowledge graph ​[17–19]​. Repurposing algorithms that operate over the data can
vary from simple pattern matching or network module analysis, through to the application of
artificial intelligence ​[20–24]​. The output of these algorithms are systematic computational
predictions and therefore need human curation, with a range of expertise, to assess their
value. Therefore, the computational prediction of repurposable drugs is usually applied in an
iterative fashion, coupled with the input of a human expert who is able to verify and generate
hypotheses about new repurposing opportunities.

The need for new drugs to treat COVID-19 has resulted in a large number of recent studies
[25–41]​. Antiviral drugs have been the most obvious target since some of these have been
shown to be active against SARS. For example, drugs such as Elbasvir are under scrutiny to
this effect ​[42]​. Other antiviral drugs, such as Remdesivir, originally employed for the
treatment of Ebola, have recently been approved for the treatment of COVID-19 ​[43]​.
However, there is still a pressing need for more candidate drugs, especially those
addressing the abnormal immune response seen in some patients ​[43,44]​. The wider search
for repurposable drugs remains a field under active development. Most of these studies are
computational in nature and have resulted in many potential new drug candidates. These
studies have employed a variety of strategies including network based analyses. Some of
these candidates are now undergoing clinical trials to test their effectiveness ​[34]​.

5

In this work we used a combination of network algorithms and human curation to search
integrated knowledge graphs for drug repurposing opportunities for COVID-19. We aimed to
highlight potential repurposing opportunities that are possibly novel in comparison to those
published so far. We also introduce some newer features to our analytical process in an
effort to improve accuracy by incorporating measures, which take data quality into account,
and to speed up data verification by facilitating multiple curation.

Many studies, for example that of Kumar 2020 ​[36]​, have employed protein interaction
networks to study the relationships between COVID-19 proteins, the proteins they interact
with, and the molecular interaction networks in the cell. However, data quality is an important
factor in the assignment of protein interactions, and has received little attention in studies
to-date. Instead of using a standard protein interaction graph, we developed a probabilistic
functional interaction network for human proteins that uses highly curated interactions from
BioGrid as a gold standard to produce a weighted protein interaction network, where the
weight indicates the confidence of a functional interaction. We then mapped onto this human
probabilistic function integrated network (PFIN) the interactions with COVID-19 proteins,
discovered experimentally in Gordon ​et al​., 2020 ​[27]​.

The process of curating computational predictions, or manually analysing networks for new
opportunities is a large-scale, time consuming task. The division of labour through network
partitioning and crowdsourcing are promising approaches to more rapid verification of results
[45,46]​. However, one of the challenges facing this approach is the assignment of
appropriate sections of a complex network to each curator. Since we were working with
PFINs that included weighted edges, we were able to employ a clustering algorithm to
partition the probabilistic network into functionally related subgraphs. Those subgraphs
containing COVID-19 protein interactors were then enriched with information from previously

6

integrated networks to add relationships to drugs, diseases, genes, pathways and so on.
Each subgraph then represents a unit of the network that was systematically assigned to a
curator for analysis. In this fashion, a large scale task is broken down and becomes faster
with more curators participating in the exercise. Here we present details of our approach to
the development and partitioning of the knowledge network and the resulting predictions for
potentially repurposable drugs.

Methods
This work extends approaches developed by Mullen ​et al​. ​[47]​. In brief, a semantic
knowledge graph was constructed in Neo4j, comprising data about existing, approved drugs.
The data sources contributing to the knowledge graph are shown in Table 1.

Using the Neo4j knowledge graph, two approaches were taken to identifying drug
repurposing candidates. In the first approach, a search of literature on COVID-19 and
SARS-CoV-2 was carried out to identify current knowledge on mechanisms of disorder
pathogenesis, including genes and proteins in ​Homo sapiens and SARS-CoV-2 t​ hat are
involved in this process. Based on the results of the literature search, semantic queries were
devised to explore the local neighbourhood around identified concepts of interest in the
knowledge graph.

In the second approach, a PFIN was created from BioGrid ​[55] v181. A PFIN is a network in
which the nodes (in this case, genes) are linked via weighted edges, with the weight
representing the confidence that the two genes functionally interact. The PFIN was
constructed using a method devised by Lee ​et al.​ ​[56]​. In brief, BioGrid v181 was partitioned
into high-throughput (HTP) datasets and low-throughput (LTP) datasets, with low-throughput
datasets being defined as datasets containing fewer than 100 interactions. By considering
the LTP datasets as a gold-standard, log likelihood scores (LLS) for the high-throughput
datasets were calculated using an approach as described by Lee ​et al​. ​[56]​,

LLS = ln

(

P (L|E) / ∼P (L|E)
P (L) / ∼P (L)

)
8

where, P(L|E) and ~P(L|E) represent the frequencies of linkages (L) observed in dataset (E)
between genes in the gold-standard, and absent from the gold-standard, respectively, and,
P(L) and ~P(L) represent the prior expectation of linkages between genes in the
gold-standard, and absent from the gold-standard, respectively.

Datasets with a LLS of 0 or lower were discarded, and the remaining datasets were sorted in
order of LLS, and integrated using the following formula:

n

WS = ∑
i=1

Li

1.1i − 1

where, L​1 is the highest LLS score and L​n that with the lowest of a set of ​n
datasets. The denominator selected to give more weight to datasets with higher confidence
was 1.1, as used in previous work by James ​et al. [​ 57]​. For visualisation purposes, functional
interaction relationships were omitted if the confidence score was lower than 4.336.

The PFIN was clustered using a weighted MCL algorithm with the default parameters and
viewed in Cytoscape ​[58,59]​. Next, for the set of ​Homo sapiens proteins identified as
interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins by Gordon ​et al. ​[60]​, ​clusters from the PFIN
containing genes that encode at least one of these proteins were extracted, decorated with
edges and nodes from the knowledge base (Fig 1), and returned.

Fig 1. Cypher query used to decorate genes in PFIN clusters that have at least one gene encoding a protein that
interacts with a SARS-CoV-2 protein. Information obtained from the knowledge base includes (1) proteins encoded by the

9

genes, (2) drugs that target any proteins in (1), (3) drugs with similarity drugs in (2), (4) disorders associated with the genes in
the PFIN cluster.

Due to limitations of the integrated database we constructed, such as a lack of side-effect
data and missing annotations for drug actions on their targets, clusters required manual
curation to identify promising targets. Thus, this analysis was crowdsourced amongst various
contributors. A Trello system was used to coordinate the distribution of clusters, collate
information, provide background material and to gather the results of the analysis by
curators.

Results
Results from the cluster analysis from multiple curators were assimilated and integrated and
are presented on a per-drug (or per-drug class, where appropriate) basis. Each section
below describes (1) the drug / class, (2) the method(s) used to identify the drug / class as a
candidate, and (3) an explanation of any relevant literature to support or refute the drug
candidacy.

Theophylline
Theophylline (IUPAC name: ​1,3-dimethyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione) is a
methylxanthine drug with activities including smooth muscle relaxation and bronchial dilation.
Indicated for conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and
asthma, theophylline exerts its activity through competitive inhibition of type III and IV
phosphodiesterase ​[61]​. Clustering of the PFIN revealed a cluster of genes, one of which,
DNAJC11​, encodes the DNA J homolog subfamily C member 11 protein (Q9NVH1), which
Gordon ​et al. ​[27] reported as interacting with the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. SARS-Cov2 ​E
encodes the envelope protein, E, which plays a role in the structure and maturation of the

10

virus ​[62]​. DNAJC11 is a mitochondrial protein which is required for mitochondrial inner
membrane organization which associates with the mitochondrial contact site and cristae
organizing system (MICOS) complex ​[62,63]​. The PFIN suggests that ​DNAJC11 h
​ as a high
likelihood of being functionally related to ​RIC3,​ which encodes the protein RIC3 (Q7Z5B4) -a protein target of theophylline (Fig 2) ​[64]​. RIC3 promotes functional expression of
homomeric alpha-7 and alpha-8 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the cell surface and is
found in endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus ​[65]​. The relevance of the functional
relationship between ​DNAJC11 a
​ nd ​RIC3 ​is unclear, however the interaction was identified
by Affinity Capture-Mass Spectroscopy, which implies a physical binding. It is possible,
therefore, that RIC3 complexes with DNAJC11 (although current evidence has them
expressed in different organelles) and theophylline could block the binding of DNAJC11 by
SARS-CoV-2 E. Interestingly, DNAJC11 has well-conserved orthologues in other species,
such as mouse, rat, and dog ​[66]​.

part of a larger PFIN cluster, but shown as disconnected due to the edge thresholding for visualisation. The red node is
Q9NVH1, the pink nodes are genes, and the blue node is theophylline. Q9NVH1 is a high-confidence interactor of the
SARS-CoV-2 nsp4 protein.

Calmodulin inhibitors
Calmodulin is a ubiquitous calcium binding protein which binds to transmembrane proteins
such as ACE ​[67]​. As described in the introduction, ACE transmembrane proteins have a
distinct role in Covid-19 infection ​[9]​. Calmodulin plays a crucial role in regulating ACE2
presence on the cell surface by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 ​[68]​. A potential
target for decreasing infection and viral loading could, therefore, be the use of calmodulin
inhibitors, acting to decrease the association of the two proteins. Without the binding of

11

calmodulin to ACE2, the cells start to shed the ectodomain of ACE2, leading to decreased
expression and catalytic activity ​[67]​. Querying our knowledge graph for approved drugs that
inhibit CALM1 (P0DP23), we identified 10 existing, approved drugs that are labelled as
inhibitors of calmodulin, indicated for a range of conditions including hypertension, seasonal
allergies, and antidepressants (full list in Table S1).

Angiotensin II
Angiotensinogen

is

a

small

peptide

hormone

which,

as

part

of

the

renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), is involved in the regulation of blood pressure
[69]​. Via the action of renin, angiotensinogen is converted into angiotensin I. In turn,
angiotensin I, via the action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is converted into
angiotensin II. Critically, ACE2 converts angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7), an effector of
nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation which has been implicated in attenuating acute lung
injury ​[70]​. The role of drugs which inhibit the RAAS, such as commonly prescribed
antihypertensive agents (e.g., ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) is
controversial, with arguments proposed for both harmful and protective effects ​[71–73]​.
Given that angiotensin II is, itself, an approved drug, it may have a therapeutic use in
COVID-19 via the actions of angiotensin (1-7). Angiotensin II has already been suggested as
a possible therapeutic agent, and is currently being investigated (NCT04332666).

Cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 synergistic targets
Whilst inhibition of the ACE2 receptor may seem an ideal target for treating COVID-19, as it
is required for both major mechanisms of viral entry into host cells, it has been shown that
ACE2 is essential for repairing damage to lung tissues. Instead, it may be possible to inhibit
TMPRSS2, which could lead to most virus particles entering the host cell via endosomes. If
cathepsin L is also inhibited, the endosome-enclosed viruses will be unable to escape,

12

allowing the endosomes to progress fully to endolysosomes and destroy the virus particles.
In this way, it may be possible to not only prevent entry into the host cell and subsequent
replication, but also reduce overall viral load by enabling the body to destroy SARS-CoV-2.

A search of ​https://clinicaltrials.gov and ​https://covid-trials.org found no trials related to COVID-19 for
the drugs listed in this table.

Previous studies have suggested that an already approved drug, camostat mesylate, could
be used as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor ​[74]​. In this study, through rational querying of the

13

knowledge graph, drug candidates for putative cathepsin L inhibitors have been identified
(Table 2). These candidates are all approved drugs. Two of these drugs, telaprevir and
boceprevir, have been used previously to help treat chronic hepatitis C infections; however,
both have since been discontinued due to common side effects such as severe rashes,
anemia, decreased neutrophils, and fatigue. Sodium aurothiomalate is a gold-containing
compound approved for use treating rheumatoid arthritis. This drug is not currently
commonly sold due to a difficulty in sourcing sodium aurothiomalate. The final potential
cathepsin L inhibitor identified in this study is fostamatinib, which is approved for use against
chronic immune thrombocytopenia. Other drug repurposing studies for COVID-19 have also
identified this drug as a potential candidate, but as an ACE2 inhibitor ​[75]​. These same
studies, however, did not evaluate it as a cathepsin L inhibitor. Based on this and previous
studies, it is therefore possible that a combined therapy of camostat mesylate and
fostamatinib may aid in treating COVID-19.
Interestingly, fostamatinib was separately identified as a drug candidate via the PFIN
clustering approach (Fig 3). Fostamatinib has serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1
(Q9UHD2) as a drug target, which was also identified by Gordon ​et al. ​[27] as being a
protein that interacts with a SARS-CoV-2 protein. However, the relevance of this interaction,
if any, is unclear to us.
Fig 3. Network view of a PFIN cluster containing fostamatinib. Fostamatinib (highlighted in yellow) is identified as targeting
a ​Homo sapiens​ protein, Q9UHD2 (red). Q9UHD2 is a high-confidence interactor of the SARS-CoV2 nsp13 protein.

Potential antiviral modulators of inflammation
Severe COVID-19 disease often includes an exaggerated inflammatory response. Stebbing
et al. suggested that combining antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments is a possible
means of reducing disease severity ​[76]​. In their study, they examined the affinity between
antiviral drugs (in particular, through inhibition of numb-associated kinases (NAKs)) and drug

14

targets that may be useful in attenuating inflammation (e.g. through inhibition of Janus
Kinases (JAKs)). As a result of the study, Stebbing ​et al. identified and discussed a range of
drugs, including baricitinib, tofacitinib, and ruxolitinib.

To determine whether there were any additional drug candidates not discussed by Stebbing
et al. ​[76]​, we queried our dataset for drugs targeting the NAKs and JAKs identified in the
paper. These proteins were as follows: AAK1 (Q2M2I8), BIKE (Q9NSY1), GAK (O14976),
JAK1 (P23458), JAK2 (O60674), JAK3 (P52333), and TYK2 (P29597). In addition to
baricitinib, tofacitinib, and ruxolitinib, we also identified fostamatinib as a potential drug
candidate. In fact, in our knowledge graph, fostamatinib was the only drug recorded as
having all the aforementioned proteins as drug targets.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors
EGFR (P00533) is a protein implicated in tissue fibrosis, due to its role in TGF-​β1 dependent
fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation. Venkataraman and Frieman, 2017 ​[77]​, suggested
that inhibiting EGFR signalling prevents excessive fibrotic responses and, thus, lung
damage, during SARS infections.

Running the query in Fig 4 identified eight approved drugs that were possible EGFR
inhibitors -- brigatinib, afatinib, osimertinib, fostamatinib, dacomitinib, neratinib, vandetanib,
and panitumumab.

EGFR with an inhibitory or suppressive action.

Lobeline, Nicotine and Galantamine
Two COVID proteins - ORF9c and NSP4 - have interactions with mitochondria-related
human proteins ZNT6 (Q6NXT4, encoded by the SLC30A6 gene, transmembrane zinc
transporter located in the golgi apparatus) and TIM29 (Q9BSF4, encoded by the TIMM29
gene, inner mitochondrial membrane translocase), respectively ​[27]​. The genes encoding
these proteins were both identified as having a high-confidence functional interaction with
the ​neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-9 (NACHR9) protein (Q9UGM1, gene
name CHRNA9) ​[78,79]​. These relationships are shown in Fig 5. NACHR9 is a is part of the
ligand-gated ionic channel and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor superfamilies, and forms
homo- or hetero-oligomeric divalent cation channels in the plasma membrane ​[80]​.

Fig 5. Portion of one of the PFIN clusters, showing the local neighbourhood around the human protein NACHR9.
Lobeline can be seen to target the protein encoded by CHRNA9. The two human proteins (Q6NXT4 and Q9BSF4) shown to
interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins are highlighted in red. Q6NXT4 is a high-confidence interactor of the SARS-CoV-2 orf9c and
Q9BSF4 is a high-confidence interactor of the SARS-COV-2 nsp4.

According to DrugBank, NACHR9 is targeted by the following small molecules: lobeline;
galantamine; nicotine; tetraethylammonium; RPI-78M and, ATG003. Lobeline, in its natural
form from plants in the ​Lobelia genus, has been proposed and applied for therapeutic uses
including respiratory disorders (such as asthma) as a stimulant to treat wheezing,
uncontrollable coughing and chest tightness ​[81]​, and has been reported to improve acute
lung injury in cell lines ​[82]​. There have been promising studies carried out on mice where
lobeline helped to treat acute lung injury ​[83]​, but human studies are still required. Nicotine
induces ACE2 overexpression in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (HBEpC) via
alpha7-nicotinic receptor (ɑ7-nAChR)​[84]​, a paralog of NACHR9. Galantamine is a
reversible, competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which catalyses the

16

breakdown of ACE, and is an allosteric modulator of nAChRs. It is currently approved for
mild to moderate dementia and Alzheimer’s.

Quercetin
Quercetin is a polyphenol flavonoid found in many plants ​[85] and has been reported as
having anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties ​[86,87]​. In one of the PFIN clusters,
quercetin was identified as targeting the human protein casein kinase II subunit beta
(CK2-beta) protein (P67870, localised throughout the cell), which Gordon ​et al. reported as
being a high-confidence interactor of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein ​[27]​. Two CK2-beta
molecules, together with a single alpha and alpha’ subunit together form the tetramer casein
kinases II (CK2). CK2 acts as a serine/threonine-selective protein kinase, involved in cell
cycle regulation, and is implicated in disorders of cell proliferation (e.g. tumours) ​[88]​.
Interestingly, CK2 has been found to be stimulated in other viral infections ​[89]​, and has
various roles in the infection cycles of different viruses ​[90,91]​. Further, Gordon ​et al.
suggested CK2 inhibition as a possible therapeutic approach for COVID-19 ​[60]​, as CK2
downregulates stress granule formation ​[92] which is associated with enhanced viral
replication in other coronavirus infections ​[93]​. Thus, depending on the nature of the
interaction between quercetin and CK2, it may be of benefit.

Quercetin has already been suggested as a possible therapeutic to mitigate the severity of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, as quercetin alters the expression of 30% of the human proteins that
are targets of SARS-CoV-2 proteins ​[94]​.

Discussion
In summary, this study aimed to build on existing studies that have used knowledge
frameworks to generate hypotheses about drug repurposing opportunities for COVID-19. As
in other studies, an integrated dataset was developed, extending a drug repurposing
framework developed by Mullen ​et al. ​[47]​. We aimed to enhance the knowledge network
approach through the use of PFINs to act as a framework to guide the hypothesis generation
process. The use of PFINs allowed us to scale the data curation process in a systematic
fashion, exploiting the combined effort of multiple curators. Our approach could act as a
template for future studies, with richer knowledge graphs, the incorporation of algorithmic
predictions for drug repurposing and a much larger set of curators. The drugs we identified
for repurposing are illustrative of the value of our approach. Due to the rapidly developing
nature of studies on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, it is difficult to identify which candidates
are truly novel, however, even in instances where candidates have already been suggested
by other studies, our approach can still provide additional supporting (or refuting) evidence.

The results presented in this study are grouped by drug class. Where possible, we have tried
to avoid suggesting specific instances of drugs (and focused on classes instead), in part
because we recognise that our database is not complete. Further, ethically, there may be
socioeconomic reasons for selecting one member of a drug class over another, such as
supply and demand or the dependence of a subpopulation on a given drug. However, there
are some noteworthy cases where focusing on specific drugs within a class is necessary.
For example, fostamatinib has emerged as a drug candidate in a number of different
contexts as an anti-inflammatory agent, as an EGFR inhibitor, and as a cathepsin L inhibitor,
establishing it as a promising candidate.

18

One limitation of ​in silico drug repurposing studies is that, depending on the algorithms
employed, many drug repurposing candidates can be suggested. Refinement of a large set
of drug candidates often requires many person-hours of time to curate, particularly when
including time taken to understand the mechanisms / pathways involved. By (1) leveraging a
PFIN-based clustering approach and (2) focusing on clusters containing high-confidence
interactors with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we were able to reduce the drug candidate search
space significantly. Using a crowd-sourcing approach to analyse the clusters allowed
individuals to curate sets of drug candidates that were likely to be mechanistically related,
providing a logical partitioning of work. Curation allowed us to focus on drugs with additional
context (e.g., pharmacological, biological) evidence to support or refute the drugs discussed,
thus providing a balanced perspective on the drugs discussed. In future studies, it might be
interesting to research systematic and computational approaches to integrating and ranking
the findings of curators, perhaps building on larger systems for data sharing and integration
such as FAIRDOMHub ​[95]​.

There are a number of caveats to this research which need to be addressed to ensure
results are taken in an appropriate context. Firstly, the data sources contributing to our
integrated semantic network are limited in scope and could be expanded. For example, the
graph includes connections between drugs and their protein targets, but the nature (e.g.
“inhibitory”, “stimulatory”, “suppressor”) is not always recorded. Secondly, computational
prediction can only ever generate suggestions or hypotheses based on the analysis of the
limited data available. Thus, for any drug repurposing candidates suggested, it is critical that
these are manually curated by experts in medicine, pharmacology, and human biology. Due
to recent concerns over the potential for harm in COVID-19 preprints, we want to stress that
this research should not be used to inform clinical practice, nor should people change their
behaviour on the basis of it ​[96]​.
