Abstract
Within a short period of time, COVID-19 grew into a world-wide pandemic. Transmission by
pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic viral carriers rendered intervention and containment of
the disease extremely challenging. Based on reported infection case studies, we construct an
epidemiological model that focuses on transmission around the symptom onset. The model is
calibrated against incubation period and pairwise transmission statistics during the initial
outbreaks of the pandemic outside Wuhan with minimal non-pharmaceutical interventions.
Mathematical treatment of the model yields explicit expressions for the size of latent and presymptomatic subpopulations during the exponential growth phase, with the local epidemic
growth rate as input. We then explore reduction of the basic reproduction number 𝑅" through
specific disease control measures such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing
masks and sheltering in place. When these measures are implemented in combination, their
effects on 𝑅" multiply. We also compare our model behaviour to the first wave of the
COVID-19 spreading in various affected regions and highlight generic and less generic
features of the pandemic development.

Introduction
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new contagious disease caused by the novel
coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) 1, which belongs to the genera of betacoronavirus, the same as
the coronavirus that caused the SARS epidemic between 2002 and 2003 2. COVID-19 has
spread to more than 200 countries/regions, with nearly 50 million confirmed cases and over
1.2 million lives claimed as of November 8, 2020 3. The outbreak has been declared a
pandemic and a public health emergency of international concern 4.
As the specific symptoms of COVID-19 are now well-publicised, symptomatic transmissions
are being contained in most countries. However, disease transmission by pre-symptomatic
and asymptomatic viral carriers is seen to be extremely difficult to deal with due to its hidden
nature 5. Clinical data reveals that viral load becomes significant before the symptom onset 6–
8
. Epidemiological investigations have identified clear cases of pre-symptomatic transmission
soon after the initial outbreak 9–12. Estimates vary greatly among experts on the percentage of
total transmission due to this group of viral carriers, ranging from as low as 18% to over 50%
13–15
. An early model-based study by Ferretti et al. 16 suggested that pre-symptomatic
transmission alone could yield a basic reproduction number 𝑅",$ = 0.9, close to the critical
value of 1.0 that sustains epidemic growth. Under intense surveillance of the pandemic, presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmissions become the main focus in outbreak control 5.
While the actual viral shedding is influenced by many factors, patient viral load during the
course of disease progression is more universal. This suggests a modelling approach that
starts with clinical observations of symptom onset, and treats disease transmission as a
dependent process that is further shaped by living and social conditions, including control
measures to reduce physical contact. Following this strategy, we first introduce a model for
an unprotected population and calibrate the model parameters against clinical case reports
during the initial outbreak. Subsequently, we estimate the percentage reduction in the basic
reproduction number (estimated to be around 3.87 at an exponential growth rate of 0.3/day)
due to contact tracing, mask wearing and other measures, individually or in combination.
Additionally, we present our findings against the epidemic development curves around the
world to highlight the level of social mobilization required to contain COVID-19 spreading.

Model
In epidemiological studies, the central quantity is the average number of infections per unit
time 𝑟(𝑡) by a primary viral carrier who was infected at 𝑡 = 0 17,18. In the case of COVID-19,
disease transmission from a given individual peaks around his/her symptom onset time 7,8, as
illustrated by the infectiousness curve shown in Fig. 1a (left panel). This property, when
averaged over the population, gives an 𝑟(𝑡) (Fig. 1a, right panel) that closely resembles the
symptom onset time distribution, which we denote by 𝑝, (𝑡) (Fig. 1a, middle panel). In fact,
when the time window of transmission is narrowly centred around the symptom onset, we
have approximately,
𝑟(𝑡) ≈ 𝑅. 𝑝, (𝑡 + 𝜃1 ).

(1)

Equation (1) defines the primary model analysed in this study. The mean reproduction
number 𝑅. sets the overall level of disease transmission in the population, and equals the
basic reproduction number 𝑅" when the infectious disease first breaks into a community. Its
actual value could change over time due to factors such as the intervention and containment
2

measures considered below. The shift parameter 𝜃1 (Fig. 1a, right panel) accommodates
changes in, e.g., isolation delays from long (𝜃1 < 0) to short (𝜃1 > 0).
Based on actual transmission data from case studies, we developed a more detailed model as
presented in Supplementary Information (SI). As illustrated in Fig. 1a and 1b, the model
takes into account the gap 𝜃5 between the peak of the infectiousness curve and the clinically
defined symptom onset. To incorporate this feature in a stochastic model for disease
transmission among individuals, we divide the pre-symptomatic period into three phases, a
non-infectious latent phase L, followed by an infectious pre-symptomatic phase A with two
subphases A1 and A2 before and after the infectiousness peak. Starting from infection at 𝑡 =
0, an individual first stays in the latent phase L. Transition to phase A1 takes place at a
duration-dependent rate 𝛼7 (𝑡). Once in phase A1, the individual is infectious with a daily
transmission rate 𝛽9 . Progression to the next phase A2 takes place at a rate 𝛼9 . The duration
of phase A2 is fixed at 𝜃5 , after which symptoms develop and the person enters the
symptomatic phase S. Upon entering A2, the patient’s disease transmission rate 𝛽: (𝜏)
weakens with the elapsed time 𝜏 = 𝑡 − 𝑡, + 𝜃5 to match the right-wing of the infectiousness
curve.
Despite the non-Markovian nature of the above model, we are able to derive the following
equation for epidemic development in a well-mixed community by focusing on the number of
the infected individuals in phase A1 (see SI, Sec. 1.1-1.3),
𝑡

(2)

where the kernel function is related to the mean reproduction rate 𝑟(𝑡) through the equation,
𝑑𝑟(𝑡)
𝐾(𝑡) = 𝛼9 𝑟(𝑡) +
.
(3)
𝑑𝑡
Under the assumption of constant transmission rate 𝛽9 and exit rate 𝛼9 , there is no need to
keep track of the temporal profile of individuals inside the A1 phase, which brings great
simplification. Equations (2) and (3) can then be solved by performing the Laplace transform,
and many analytical results follow. In this respect our model is equally tractable
mathematically as the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) type models defined
by a set of rate equations 19, while retaining the more general temporal structure for disease
progression and transmission, which in turn allows for more precise evaluation of control
measures that target specific subpopulations.
In the SI, we show that the mean reproduction number of the detailed model is given by 𝑅. =

When the right wing of the infectiousness curve in Fig. 1a takes the form of an exponentially
decaying function 𝛽: (𝜏) = 𝛽9 𝑒 IJK L with a sufficiently large decay rate 𝛼: , we recover Eq.

Parameter Calibration and Basic Properties
Incubation period
By combining three data sets 11,20,21 with a total of 347 infection cases outside the Hubei
province in China, we estimated the incubation period statistics 𝑝, (𝑡) (see Fig. 2a). Due to
the difficulty in identifying a precise date of infection, a window is assigned to the incubation
period in each case. A rudimentary way to deal with the uncertainty is to treat all possible
values inside the window as equally likely. This procedure yields a statistical distribution for
each of the three data sets as well as the conglomerated one, as shown by symbols in Fig. 2a.
Alternatively, viewing the data as samples of a common underlying probability distribution,
we estimated 𝑝, (𝑡) by likelihood maximization (see Methods and SI Sec. 2.1). Within the
class of functions considered, the log-normal distribution combined with an exponential tail
yields the largest likelihood value (Fig. 2a, red line). From day 6 onward, 𝑝, (𝑡) follows an
exponential decay with a rate of −0.31/day, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of (−0.35,
−0.27) per day. We have also examined other values (from day 4 to day 8) for the switch. In
all cases, exponential tail decay rates are found to be round −0.31/day (see SI Sec. 2.1).
Infectiousness function
The infectiousness function is usually defined as how infectious an individual is in terms of
time since infection. In view of the transmission characteristics of COVID-19, we quantify
the normalized infectiousness around the symptom onset instead (see Methods). A data set of
77 pairwise transmissions in several eastern and southeastern Asian countries and regions
during their initial COVID-19 outbreak was compiled by He et al. 7 We took 66 pairs to
estimate the underlying probability distribution 𝑝N (𝑡) of the day of transmission t with respect
to the symptom onset of the primary case, with results shown in Fig. 2b. (See Methods and SI
Sec. 2.2 for details.) Under a maximum likelihood estimation scheme, we considered three
alternative forms for 𝑝N (𝑡). All have exponential tails far away from the transmission peak,
but differ in the way the two wings are joined together in the peak region. In the first case, the
two exponential tails join directly to produce a cusp in the middle. In the second case, a flat
top of variable width is introduced. In the third case, the flat top is replaced by a parabolic
cap to give a more rounded peak. It turns out that the cusp function, with its peak located at
0.68 days before the symptom onset, is the most probable for this data set (Fig. 2b). Decay
rates for the left and right wings are given by 0.46/day and 0.54/day, respectively (see SI Sec.
2.2).
Due to its Markovian nature, the A1 phase has a duration that is also exponentially distributed.
This gives rise to an exponential tail of the population-averaged infectiousness curve prior to
entering the A2 phase. We therefore set the model parameters to 𝛼9 = 0.46/day, 𝜃5 = 0.68
days, and 𝛽: (𝜏) = 𝛽9 𝑒 IJK L with 𝛼: = 0.54/day. These values were used in the numerical
calculations presented below. The corresponding CIs are given in Table I.
Serial interval
Xu et al. 22 compiled a database of 1407 COVID-19 transmission pairs outside the Hubei
province in China between early January till mid-February 2020. Among them, 677 pairs
have the symptom onset dates and social relationships of infector-infectees. A detailed
analysis of the data set, stratified before, during and one week after the Wuhan lockdown on
4

23 January 2020, was carried out by Ali et al. 23 which showed reduction of the serial interval
of symptom onsets by a factor of 3 over the five weeks. In Fig. 2c, we show the distribution
of the serial interval data for the whole period (solid circles) and separately for the first (open
squares) and last two weeks (open triangles) of the period. The red line gives the predicted
serial interval distribution

IQ

using our estimated values for 𝑝, (𝑡) and 𝑝N (𝑡) . While the overall agreement with the
unstratified data is good especially on the positive side, it is also evident that serial intervals
can be affected by factors such as the percentage of imported cases, the length of isolation
delays, etc. which changed substantially before and after the Wuhan lockdown. As suggested
in Ref. 23, their effect can be simulated with a shape function that masks 𝑝N (𝑡). For example,
an imported case spent part of his/her infectious period outside the region where the data was
collected, shifting 𝑝1N (𝑡) to the right. On the other hand, vigorous contact tracing shortens
isolation delays significantly, which in turn shifts 𝑝1N (𝑡) to the left.
Mean reproduction number
Under Eq. (1), the well-known Lotka–Euler estimating equation 24 yields,
𝑒 ISFT
𝑅. =
,
𝑝U, (𝜆)

(6)

∞

where 𝑝U, (𝜆) = ∫" 𝑝, (𝑡)𝑒 ISP 𝑑𝑡 is the Laplace transform of 𝑝, (𝑡) (see SI Secs. 1.4 and 3.1).
Using the estimated values above, we obtain from Eq. (6) the 𝑅. versus 𝜆 curve shown in
Fig. 3a, which covers both the growth (𝜆 > 0) and declining (𝜆 < 0) phases of the epidemic.
The slope of the curve at 𝑅. = 1 is given by 1/𝑇X, where 𝑇X is the mean generation time and
equals 𝜏, − 𝜃1 = 6.19 days under Eq. (6). The intercept of the curve at 𝑅. = 0 gives an
ultimate epidemic decay rate of −0.31/day when disease transmission comes to a complete
halt.
To estimate the uncertainty in the computed 𝑅. -𝜆 curve, we performed bootstrap analysis of
the data used to obtain 𝑝, (𝑡) and 𝑝N (𝑡). The detailed procedure is described in the SI (Sec. 2),
with the result shown in Fig. 3a. At a growth rate of 𝜆 = 0.3/day, our estimated value of the
basic reproduction number 𝑅" is 3.87 (95% CI [3.38, 4.48]).
Composition of the infected population
As we demonstrate in the SI, the convolutional form of our main equation (2) enables many
analytic results to be derived and evaluated with the calibrated parameters. Figure 3b shows
the probabilities that a given individual is in one of the four phases on day t after infection,
computed using the formula in Table S1 in the SI. The red line marks the boundary between
the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases. The width of the orange-coloured region (A1
phase), on the other hand, is proportional to 𝛼9I? ≈ 2 days.
Figure 3c, obtained from the Laplace transforms of these curves, gives the percentage of the
infected population in each of the four phases on a given day when the epidemic is growing
at a rate 𝜆. These curves allow for estimation of the hidden population in L, A1 and A2 phases
from the knowledge of S in real-time. They form the basis for quantitative assessment of

5

intervention measures. Note that at high growth rates, a larger percentage of the infected
population is in the latent and pre-symptomatic phases, so that suppressing transmission by
this group through, say mask wearing and social distancing, assumes a greater priority.

Evaluation of Intervention Measures
Testing and contact tracing
To break the transmission chain in the community, governments around the world have
adopted two measures with varying levels of intensity: 1) testing and isolating infected
individuals; and 2) tracing and quarantining contacts of infected individuals.
For testing control, persons in close proximity to a confirmed infection case are asked to
undergo voluntary or mandatory testing for infection, and quarantined when the result is
positive. From Fig. 3b we see that, if the test is conducted too close to the day of infection,
the individual has a high probability to still be in the latent phase, hence the test result is
likely to be negative. On the other hand, if the test is conducted too late, the person may have
already infected others so that the reduction of 𝑟(𝑡) given by Eq. (1) is small. Therefore,
there is an optimal window between the infection date and the test date, which we analyse in
the SI. In Fig. 4a, we show the reduction of the basic reproduction number 𝑅" as a function of
the reporting delay, assuming all suspected contacts are tested. At 𝑅" =3.87, if the results
become available immediately after testing, the reduction of 𝑅" is shown as the blue curve,
better than the testing outcomes with one day delay (red curve). The largest reduction is
obtained when the test is performed 3 days after the contact. This corresponds to the day
when the width of the orange plus dark blue region in Fig. 3b is the widest.
For contact tracing and quarantine, we show our results under the scenario that a fraction
𝑞Z of infectees are tracked down and quarantined within a time window 𝑇trace since infection
(Fig. 4b, blue line). This would bring the mean reproduction number 𝑅. from 𝑅" = 3.87 to a
value below 1 if full tracing and quarantine is executed within 6 days after contact. An 80%
tracing efficiency shrinks the time window to 3-4 days for achieving the same effect (Fig. 4b,
red line). Details can be found in Secs. 4.2 and 4.3 of the SI. The shaded areas on the plot,
obtained from bootstrap analysis, show the range of the predicted reduction due to
uncertainties in the incubation period estimation (see SI Sec. 2.1.3).
Social distancing and mask wearing
Other than government-led intervention to break the transmission chain, individual-led efforts,
including social-distancing, mask-wearing, frequent hand-washing, etc., can slow down or
even stop the outbreak. Among them, radical shifts have taken place in people's attitudes
towards population-wide mask wearing. It was enforced in most Asian countries since the
initial phase of the outbreak, yet not adopted by EU and USA until June this year. As of
August, community mask use was recommended or required by most major public health
bodies 25,26. However, despite multiple experiments performed on measuring the trapping
efficacy of masks on viral particles at individual’s level 27-30 the aggregate impact of mask
wearing at the population level is not yet clearly quantified. Given the now established risk
of pre-symptomatic transmission, and the dominant role of droplet-mediated COVID-19
infections 31, masks with relatively low efficacy for personal protection may nevertheless
reduce the overall infections in a population 32. Based on a previous study on influenza
6

aerosols 33, we constructed a semi-quantitative model to show that mask-wearing reduces
𝑟(𝑡) and hence 𝑅. by a factor (1 − 𝑒 ⋅ 𝑝a )b , where 𝑒 is the efficacy of trapping viral
particles inside the mask, and 𝑝a is the percentage of the mask-wearing population (see SI
Sec. 4.4). According to this model, even for masks with intermediate efficacy (e = 50%),
population-wide mask-wearing at 𝑝a = 98% alone could bring down 𝑅. from its basic value
𝑅" = 3.87 to 1.
When combined with contact tracing (Fig. 4c), the two effects multiply. Figure 4c shows a
heatmap of the reduced 𝑅. when contact tracing and isolation is completed within 5 days of
infection. The solid black line indicates that the reduced 𝑅. reaches 1. For example, the
combination of tracing of close contacts at 60% efficiency within 5 days and 60% of the
general public wearing masks achieves the same purpose. This target line can be reached with
lower percentages when close contacts can be found within 2 days of possible infection
(dash-dotted line), but the numbers need to be higher when the time frame is relaxed to 8
days (dashed line).

Epidemic Development: Generic Features
We examined the temporal progression of COVID-19 outbreaks in different parts of the
world using the data available from the Johns Hopkins CSSE Repository 34, with the aim to
extract more universal aspects of the pandemic development in light of our model studies.
Other than China, our exploration is limited to the initial stage of COVID-19 outbreaks till
end of March 2020.
Provincial outbreaks and containment in China
We focused on the daily confirmed cases from various provinces since the Wuhan lockdown
on January 23, 2020. Broadly speaking, the ascending and descending curves follow very
similar exponential laws, while the time it took to achieve the crossover was affected by the
overall extent of the epidemic as well as occurrences of smaller outbreaks. From the data, we
define three phases of the epidemic development.
Phase I is characterised by an exponential growth of the epidemic. In the first week after the
Wuhan lockdown, nearly all provinces registered a growth rate of approximately 0.3/day (Fig.
5, region shaded in pink) in the newly confirmed cases. Reports indicate that most of the
growth during this period was driven by imported cases from Hubei province, whose own
growth continued at this rate for a longer period (Fig. 5a). The fraction of local infections
during import-driven growth can be calculated and the result depends on the local value of 𝑅.
(see SI Sec. 4.5).
Phase II is a crossover phase where public policies on border control and local intervention
measures become increasingly stringent. On a logarithmic scale, data from the most affected
provinces (except Hubei) show consistent behaviour. Closer examination, however, reveals
the presence of sporadic outbreaks. Well-documented examples include prison cases in Hubei,
Shandong and Zhejiang provinces 35. Overall, under the swift and forceful implementation of
COVID-19 surveillance, turnaround of the epidemic in provinces other than Hubei was
reached in about three weeks after the Wuhan lockdown. In Fig. 5b and the supplementary

7

Fig. S4, we present simulation results using our model, assuming a linear decrease of 𝑅.
from a local value of 2.0 to zero over a period 𝑇, which indeed reproduces the data in Fig. 5.
The more gradual change of 𝑅. assumed in our simulations can be interpreted as due to the
progressive mobility control and isolation policies including additional lockdowns, which
took place from February 4-10 36,37, as well as allocation of massive resources by relevant
authorities to conduct rigorous contact tracing and to rapidly expand isolation facilities for
use by COVID-19 patients 38.
Phase III, or the final descent, occurred when the intervention measures essentially
terminated transmission in the community. The few that re-emerged were quickly traced and
contained. Within our model, the newly confirmed cases in this period are identified with the
shrinking number of individuals moving from the latent to the symptomatic phase, as one
moves along the time axis in Fig. 3b. Strikingly, the observed decay rate in this phase reached
the maximum value of 0.31/day predicted by our model, including data from Hubei province
shown in Fig. 5a. This observation indicates that the infected cases were isolated at extremely
high efficiency. Interestingly, a similar decay in the daily new cases is seen on the cruise ship
Diamond Princess (Fig. 5b).
The first wave outside mainland China
Figures 6a-c show the daily confirmed cases in selected countries and regions from late
January till end of March 2020. Countries and regions in east Asia shown in Fig. 6a
experienced the first wave sooner than the rest of the world, but the epidemic growth rate is
much lower than other places due to the prevention measures in place such as border control
and mask wearing by the general public. Despite these measures, South Korea documented a
major outbreak in the second half of February that elevated the overall level of the epidemic
in the country 39 (Fig. 6c). In Europe and the US, exponential growth of the pandemic, with a
growth rate close to 0.3/day, were reported in a number of countries from the beginning of
March onward (Fig. 6b), driven by local infections.
The surging pandemic triggered emergent response by public health authorities and
governments at all levels. Towards the end of March, countries that adopted stringent
intervention measures have seen a significant reduction of the pandemic growth rate (Fig. 6b).
The government of Italy imposed a national quarantine on March 9 40, after which growth in
the number of newly confirmed cases slowed down 34. On the other hand, South Korea
implemented aggressive contact tracing and testing policies 41,42, enabling the country to
bring the outbreak to a much-reduced level at 𝑅. ≈ 1.0.
In Fig. 6d we show the estimated epidemic growth rate 𝜆(𝑡) against the cumulative number
of confirmed cases N(t) in five representative countries. We computed the growth rate from
the local slope of the ln 𝑁(𝑡) against t curve, i.e., 𝜆(𝑡) = ln[𝑁(𝑡)/𝑁(𝑡 − Δ𝑡)] /Δ𝑡, using a
time window Δ𝑡 = 3 days. The interval between a few tens to a few thousands cumulative
cases can be taken as the first phase of local outbreaks in these countries, where the estimated
values of 𝜆(𝑡) remain approximately stable. Three of the five countries exhibited growth
rates of approximately 0.3/day during this period, while Iran and Japan assumed values above
0.4/day and around 0.1/day, respectively. It is evident that epidemic preparedness and
cultural aspects significantly affected COVID-19 spreading in the local population, before
government intervention and containment measures took effect. A more complete discussion
of growth rates during the exponential phase in different countries and regions can be found
in SI, Sec. 5.

Summary and Discussions
We have succeeded in developing a directly calibratable model for COVID-19 transmission
by both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic viral carriers. This was made possible by focusing
on transmission around the symptom onset, which is a prominent feature of the disease. We
then compartmentalised the pre-symptomatic period into three phases, and constructed a
dynamical equation for the subpopulation in the A1 phase where infectiousness reaches its
maximum. The simplicity of the model allows for explicit mathematical expressions to be
derived. Quantification of transmission risks at different stages of patient disease progression
facilitates assessment of control measures, either to break the transmission chain or to reduce
the overall level of social contacts in the community. For example, contact tracing in
combination with mask wearing in public places, can have a strong and immediate effect in
bringing down the epidemic growth. In reality, governments often take incremental steps in
intervention measures to ease their impact on the economy and on people’s livelihood. The
quantitative treatment of epidemic control carried out in this study can serve as a reference in
the decision-making process.
On a technical level, the modelling framework presented here is intuitive and flexible, and
allows easy association of clinical features with population level pandemic development.
This can be a significant advantage when the need arises to adapt the epidemic model to
specific social environments and demographic composition. Our estimated incubation period
distribution is in excellent agreement with other studies (see Table I for a comparison of key
statistical features) and furthermore is not expected to change significantly over time. This
places Eq. (1) as a convenient starting point for exploring temporal structures of the epidemic
development. The shift parameter 𝜃1 in the equation embodies, in an explicit form, changing
patterns of disease transmission from symptomatic to the pre-symptomatic viral carriers, and
hence can serve as an important index for epidemic control.
With regard to the quantitative predictions under specific intervention measures, the main
uncertainty comes from estimation of their efficacy in reducing transmission from the
infectious subpopulations identified in this study. As a baseline study, we estimated the
infectiousness function 𝑝N (𝑡) based on a relatively small data set of 66 transmission pairs
which led to a sizable CI at 95% for its wings. This could improve as more carefully curated
transmission cases during the initial outbreak become available. Response of the public to
specific intervention measures is a complex topic that deserves extensive research in the
future.
Finally, as with other epidemic models that assume a well-mixed population, our current
modelling framework does not treat epidemic spreading in a heterogeneous population that
exhibits complex spatio-temporal dynamics, nor does it consider significant differences in
disease progression and transmission in different age groups. Some of the basic questions in
COVID-19 epidemiological studies, such as whether pre-symptomatic spread constitutes a
major contributor to disease transmission 43,44, cannot have definitive answers without
considering these additional factors. In a large population, while individual outbreaks in
specific communities may still follow the dynamics proposed here with suitable values of 𝑅. ,
transmission across communities requires a separate treatment.

Maximum likelihood estimation and uncertainty/sensitivity analysis
Incubation period distribution – We analysed incubation periods of a total of N = 347 cases
by combining three datasets 11,20,21. For most cases, the infection date can only be assigned to
a time window of more than one day. Therefore, the actual incubation period falls between
IPli and IPui, i = 1, ..., N, where IPli and IPui are the lower and upper bounds for case i. We
perform maximum likelihood estimation of the underlying symptom onset time distribution
𝑝, (𝑡), following a scheme proposed by Reich et al. 47 Considering the exponential tail
observed in the real data, we write,
𝑝, (𝜃, 𝑡) = k

𝐴𝑝lmno (𝑡)
for 𝑡 ≤ 𝑡m
Ip(PIP
)
q for 𝑡 ≥ 𝑡
𝐴𝑝lmno (𝑡m )𝑒
m

where 𝐴 is the normalisation factor. Transition to the exponential decay (with rate 𝛾) takes
place at 𝑡m . Following common practice in the epidemiological literature, we take 𝑝lmno (𝑡) to
be a truncated log-normal or Weibull distribution with 2 parameters in each case,
(ln 𝑡 − 𝜇)b

Continuity of derivatives at 𝑡m yields,

Thus we are left with a set of 3 independent parameters. To estimate these parameters from
the data, we consider the likelihood function,
•

𝐿(𝜃; 𝐈𝐏) = ‹ 𝐿(𝜃; IPlŽ , IPuŽ )
Ž‘?

with

N5’“ ”".•

𝐿Ž = 𝐿(𝜃; IPlŽ , IPuŽ ) = B

N5l“ I".•

𝑝, (𝜃, 𝑡)𝑑𝑡

We performed optimization and sensitivity analyses by scanning 𝑡m values from 4 to 8, and
infinity for log-normal distribution and from 3 to 7, and infinity for Weibull distribution. The
best estimate is obtained when 𝑝lmno (𝑡) is a truncated log-normal distribution with 𝑡m = 6 (see
SI Sec. 2.1 for details).
We also performed bootstrap analysis to determine uncertainties in the estimated 𝑝, (𝑡). This
is done by generating 1000 re-sampled copies of the original dataset with 347 cases. The
maximum likelihood estimation of 𝑝, (𝑡) is then performed for each of the re-sampled copy.
The 95% CIs were obtained from the 1,000 replications (see Table I).
Infectiousness profile – Disease transmission is quantified by the infectiousness function
𝑝N (𝑡), which gives the probability density function for pairwise transmission at time t since
the symptom onset of the infector. We infer 𝑝N (𝑡) by maximum likelihood estimation, using
the infector-infectee pairs published by He et al. 7. In this dataset, the infectee exposure
windows were documented in addition to the symptom onset dates of both infectors and

11

infectees (77 pairs in total). Among them, 66 pairs have a unique symptom onset date (see
Source data), which are used here.
Given the general form and the limited temporal resolution of the dataset, we adopted simple
exponentials for the two wings of the infectiousness function joined in the middle by a cap
function,
𝐴𝑓(𝑡9 )𝑒 J˜(PIP˜ )
𝑡 ≤ 𝑡9
𝑡9 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑡:
𝑝N (𝜃, 𝑡) = –𝐴𝑓(𝑡)
(PIP
)
IJ
𝐴𝑓(𝑡: )𝑒 K K
𝑡 ≥ 𝑡:
where A is the normalisation factor. The infectiousness function transits to the left
exponential tail at 𝑡9 and to the right exponential tail at 𝑡: . Between 𝑡9 and 𝑡: , it takes the
form of 𝑓(𝑡). We consider three different forms of 𝑓(𝑡):
• Model 1: 𝑓 (𝑡) = 1 and 𝑡9 = 𝑡: = 𝑡5 (two exponential tails directly join at 𝑡5 );
Independent parameters 𝜃 = (𝛼9 , 𝛼: , 𝑡5 ).
• Model 2: 𝑓 (𝑡) = 1 and 𝑡9 < 𝑡: (two exponential tails with a flat cap of length 𝜖 =
𝑡: − 𝑡9 , centred at 𝑡5 ); Independent parameters 𝜃 = (𝛼9 , 𝛼: , 𝜖, 𝑡5 ).
• Model 3: 𝑓(𝑡) = [1 − 𝜒(𝑡 − 𝑡5 )b ] and 𝑡9 < 𝑡: (two exponential tails with a rounded
cap peaked at 𝑡5 , whose shape is characterized by 𝜒); Independent parameters 𝜃 =
(𝛼9 , 𝛼: , 𝜒, 𝑡5 ) (𝑡9 and 𝑡: are determined by the smoothness condition).
We perform maximum likelihood estimations using the dataset mentioned above, where each
transmission pair i is associated with an exposure window Wi=[Wli,Wui] relative to the
symptom onset of the infector. The likelihood function is constructed as follows:
•

𝐿(𝜃; 𝐖) = ‹ 𝐿(𝜃; WlŽ , WuŽ ),
Ž‘?

where

•’“ ”".•

𝐿Ž = 𝐿(𝜃; WlŽ , WuŽ ) = B

•l“ I".•

𝑝N (𝜃, 𝑡)𝑑𝑡

Sensitivity analysis is performed at a set of values for 𝜖 (Model 2) and 𝜒 (Model 3),
respectively. In both cases, the best estimate degenerates into Model 1 (see SI Sec. 2.2 for
details).
The uncertainty in the estimated 𝑝N (𝑡) is determined through bootstrapping with 1,000
replications, with which the 95% CIs were obtained (see Table I).
