Abstract. The Italian government has been one of the most responsive to COVID-2019
emergency, through the adoption of quick and increasingly stringent measures to contain the
outbreak. Despite this, Italy has suffered a huge human and social cost, especially in Lombardy.
The aim of this paper is dual: i) first, to investigate the reasons of the case fatality rate (CFR)
differences across Italian 20 regions and 107 provinces, using a multivariate OLS regression
approach; and ii) second, to build a “taxonomy” of provinces with similar mortality risk of
COVID-19, by using the Ward’s hierarchical agglomerative clustering method. I considered
health system metrics, environmental pollution, climatic conditions, demographic variables, and
three ad hoc indexes that represent the health system saturation. The results showed that overall
health care efficiency, physician density, and average temperature helped to reduce the CFR. By
the contrary, population aged 70 and above, car and firm density, level of air pollutants (NO2, O3,
PM10, and PM2.5), relative average humidity, COVID-19 prevalence, and all three indexes of
health system saturation were positively associated with the CFR. Population density, social
vertical integration, and altitude were not statistically significant. In particular, the risk of dying
increases with age, as 90 years old and above had a three-fold greater risk than the 80–to–89 years
old and four-fold greater risk than 70–to–79 years old. Moreover, the cluster analysis showed that
the highest mortality risk was concentrated in the north of the country, while the lowest risk was
associated with southern provinces. Finally, since prevalence and health system saturation
indexes played the most important role in explaining the CFR variability, a significant part of the
latter may have been caused by the massive stress of the Italian health system.

1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome detected for
the first time in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. On March 11, 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO, 2020) declared that COVID-19 could be characterized as a
pandemic. As of July 26, 2020, according to Worldometer (2020), the virus has spread across 213
countries and territories, affecting over 16,4 million people and causing more than 650 thousand
deaths. Italy was one of the countries hit the worst by the pandemic, with almost 250 thousand
confirmed cases and over 35 thousand deaths at the time of writing. Despite the widely recognized
excellence of the Italian health system (World Health Organization, 2010; GBD, 2017;
Bloomberg 2019), the country has paid a very high price, with one of the highest case fatality rate
(CFR) in the world (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/coronavirus-cfr). However, at the peak of
the epidemic, mortality was affected by a large spatial heterogeneity; in fact, the northern regions
were characterized on average by a significantly higher CFR than southern regions (Figure 1).
The aim of this work is to contribute to the existing literature by investigating the main reasons
and determinants of COVID-19 CFR in Italian regions and provinces. In particular, in the last
months, a plenty and increasing body of literature focused its attention on the environmental,
meteorological, demographic, and social factors that may affect COVID-19 mortality (Bayer and
Kuhn, 2020; Brandt et al., 2020; Comunian et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Pansini
and Fornacca, 2020; Sannigrahi et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a; Verity et al., 2020; Zhu et al.,
2020).
Ma et al. (2020) used a generalized additive model (GAM) to study the relationship between the
meteorological factors and the daily deaths of COVID-19 in Wuhan from January 20, 2020 to
February 29, 2020. They found a positive association between the daily deaths of COVID-19 and
the diurnal temperature range (DTR), and a negative relationship between the former and the
relative humidity and temperature. Similarly, Wu et al. (2020b) used a log-linear GAM to analyze
the effect of temperature and humidity on daily new deaths of COVID-19 in 166 countries, as of
March 27, 2020. Temperature and relative humidity were found to be both significantly and
negatively associated with daily new deaths. Rahman et al. (2020) performed partial correlation
analysis and linear mixed effect modeling to analyze the effect of temperature on COVID-19
mortality risk in 149 countries. They showed that higher temperatures were negatively associated
with mortality in high-income countries, while extreme temperature may increase mortality risk
in low-and middle-income countries.
Sannigrahi et al. (2020) used spatial regression models to analyze the spatial association between
the key demographic variables and COVID-19 deaths across 31 European countries. They found
that the incidence of the population aged 80 and above on overall casualties caused by COVID19 was highly significant. Verity et al. (2020) used a model-based approach to estimate the case
fatality ratio associated with age groups in mainland China. They found that the population aged
80 and above had the highest case fatality ratio (13.4%). Similarly, Du et al. (2020), by
implementing a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, showed that advanced
age is a significant risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. Moreover, Ioannidis et al. (2020), by
using official data from 14 countries and 13 US states as of June 17, 2020, estimated that age risk
gradients were highly significant. In particular, people aged less than 65 had 16-100-fold lower
risk of COVID-19 deaths than older people.
Regarding the effect of air pollutants on COVID-19 related deaths, Conticini et al. (2020), by
investigating the relevant literature, concluded that prolonged exposure to air pollutants may lead
to chronic respiratory conditions, even in healthy and young people. Wu et al. (2020a) analyzed
COVID-19 death counts for 3,087 counties in the USA, covering 98% of the population, by using
a negative binomial mixed model. They found that a positive and significant association between
PM2.5 and COVID-19 mortality rates. In particular, a 1 unit increase in PM2.5 is related to an 8%
increase in the COVID-19 fatality rate. Pansini and Fornacca (2020), using Kendall’s tau and
Pearson correlation coefficient, found a positive and significant association between COVID-19
mortality and several air pollutants (CO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5) in China and the USA.

Ogen (2020) used spatial analysis to examine the relationship between long-term exposure to NO2
and COVID-19 mortality in 66 administrative regions in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. He
showed that 78% of the total COVID-19 deaths were located in north Italy and central Spain, i.e.
the regions with the highest level of NO2. Bianconi et al. (2020), using multiple linear regression
models, showed that mean annual exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 was significantly and positively
associated with COVID-19 death rate in Italian 20 regions. Yao et al. (2020), by using spatial
analysis and multivariate linear regression for China as of April 12, 2020, found that every 10
μg/m3 increase in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations is associated with a 0.24% and 0.26% increase
in the COVID-19 mortality rate, respectively. Brandt et al. (2020) also stressed that air pollution
levels are strongly associated with densely populated urban areas in the USA. Hamidi et al. (2020)
investigated both direct and indirect impacts of population density on death rates in 913 USA
metropolitan countries by using structural equation modeling. They found that larger metropolitan
areas and counties with higher population density were significantly associated with higher
mortality rates.
In early March 2020, Bayer and Kuhn (2020) advanced the hypothesis that Italian higher vertical
social integration may arise the COVID-19 fatality rate. They used a sample of 24 countries with
at least 200 COVID-19 confirmed cases and found a positive correlation between the share of the
population aged 30-49 living with parents and COVID-19 death rate. However, this relation was
strongly criticized by Belloc et al. (2020), which showed how the sign of the correlation turned
negative when considering the variation within Italian regions. Finally, several studies have
shown that the presence of at least one comorbidity, such as hypertension, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease, negatively affects outcomes of patients
hospitalized with COVID-19 (Guan et al., 2020; Istat-ISS, 2020; Jordan et al., 2020;Wang et al.,
2020; Wu and McGoogan, 2020).
2. Material and Method
The aim of this study is to estimate the main determinants of COVID-19 mortality rate at the peak
of the virus outbreak in 20 Italian regions and 107 Italian provinces. Specifically, I chose the peak
of mild and severe cases of COVID-19, which was approximately reached on April 3–4, 2020
(Figure 2), because it can be considered as the moment of maximum health care system saturation.
First, I used a multivariate cross-sectional OLS (ordinary least squares) approach to identify the
main determinants at regional at province level, and then I applied the Ward’s hierarchical
agglomerative clustering method (Ward 1963) to build a “taxonomy” of provinces with similar
mortality risk of COVID-19. The rationale behind the choice of cross-sectional regression
methodology instead of a panel approach is as follows: i) comprehensive daily data on March
2020 are not currently available for environmental pollution and climatic variables; and ii)
demographic and health system variables change very little or not at all in the short term.
At regional level, I used the following 17 explanatory variables (Table 1): an overall index (IPS)
of the Italian health system performance in 2017–2018, the public health expenditure per capita
in the period 2015–2017, the total specialist doctors and general practitioners per 1,000
inhabitants in the period 2016–2018, the total ordinary hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants in the
period 2016–2018, an index of car and firm density in 2015–2017, the electric power consumption
(kWh per capita) in the period 2016–2018,1 the proportion of population aged 70 and over in
2019, the proportion of population aged 80 and over in 2019, the proportion of population aged
90 and over in 2019, the vertical social integration proxied by the share of adults aged 18–34
living with their parents in 2019, the average relative humidity levels registered during March
2020, the average historical diurnal temperature range (DTR) in March, the average historical
temperature in March, the average prevalence of COVID-19 on April 3 and 4, 2020, the ratio
between the COVID-19 prevalence and the ordinary hospital beds, an two ad hoc indexes that
1

Car and firm density and electricity consumption can be considered as two proxy indicators for air
pollution.

indicate the saturation of ordinary hospital beds (OB) and critical care beds (CCB) at the peak of
the outbreak, respectively. The dependent variable is represented by the average case fatality rate
of COVID-19 on April 3 and 4, 2020.2
At the province level, I used the following 18 explanatory variables (Table 2): the average general
practitioners per 1,000 inhabitants in the period 2015–2017, the historical average temperature in
March, the historical average diurnal temperature range (DTR) in March, an ordinal index of the
population structure (rural-intermediate-urban) in 2013, the population density (people per sq.
km) in 2019, the proportion of population aged 70 and over in 2019, the proportion of population
aged 70–79 in 2019, the proportion of population aged 80–89 in 2019, the proportion of
population aged 90 and over in 2019, the average emissions (in µg/m3) of particulate matter less
than 10 micrometers in diameter (PM10) in 2017–2018, the number of days in which PM10
exceeded the legal limit of 50 µg/m3,3 the average emissions (in µg/m3) of particulate matter less
than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) in the period 2017–2018, the average emission of
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) expressed in µg/m3 in 2017–2018, the number of days in which ozone
(O3) exceeded the limit of 120 µg/m3,4 the average altitude of the capital city of each province,
the prevalence of COVID-19 on March 31, 2020, and the ratio between the COVID-19 prevalence
on March 31 and the average number of ordinary hospital beds in in the period 2016–2018. The
dependent variable is represented by the case fatality rate of COVID-19 on March 31, 2020.5
Further details are provided in Tables 1 and 2.6
The OLS equation estimated at the regional and provincial level was as follows:
𝑦𝑖 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑋1 +. . . 𝛽𝑛 𝑋𝑛 + 𝜀𝑖
[1]
Where i represented the regions/provinces, 𝛽0 was the intercept, X1 to Xn were the independent
variables for each region/province, and εi was the random error.
Then, I conducted a cluster analysis on selected significant variables obtained from multivariate
OLS on province data. The procedure encompassed the following 4 sequential steps. First, since
variables are not on the same scale, I calculated the standardized data matrix by using the
following formula:
𝑥−𝜇
𝑧=
[2]
𝜎
Where x was the value of the variable in the original dataset, μ was the arithmetic mean of the
original variable, and σ was the standard deviation of the latter. Second, I computed the Euclidean
distance. Given two points X and Y in d dimensional space, the Euclidean distance between X
and Y was equal to:
‖𝑋 − 𝑌‖ = √∑𝑑𝑖=1(𝑥𝑖 − 𝑦𝑖 )²

[3]

Then, I applied Ward’s hierarchical clustering method, which allowed to obtain clusters of
provinces with features as similar as possible by minimizing the total within-cluster variance.
Specifically, at each step, the pair of clusters that are characterized by minimum between-cluster
distance were merged. Therefore, Ward’s method merging cost formula between two clusters, p
and q, was given by:
2
2
𝛥(𝑝, 𝑞) = ∑𝑖∈𝑝∈𝑞‖𝑥𝑖 − 𝑚𝑝∪𝑞 ‖ − ∑𝑖∈𝑝‖𝑥𝑖 − 𝑚𝑝 ‖ − ∑𝑖∈𝑞‖𝑥𝑖 − 𝑚𝑞 ‖²
[4]

According to Baud et al. (2020) and Scheiner et al. (2020), there is a delay between infection and death
of about 14 days. However, on one hand, the prevalence on March 19–21 and April 3–4 had an almost
perfectly positive correlation of 0.96 (elaboration on data from http://www.salute.gov.it), and on the other,
the CFR increased exponentially until the peak, and then it has continued to grow much more slowly
(https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/coronavirus-cfr).
3
The legal limit is laid down in Directive 2008/50/EC (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32008L0050).
4
The average emissions of air pollutants for each province have been calculated by using the annual data
coming from a maximum of 266 urban and suburban monitoring stations, spread all over the country (Istat,
2019).
5
Istat released only the overall death for March 31, April 30, and May 31, 2020.
6
Some descriptive statistics are also reported in the Supplementary Material (Tables S1 and S2).

From this, it was obtained:
𝑛 𝑛
∆(𝑝, 𝑞) = 𝑝 𝑞 ‖𝑚𝑝 − 𝑚𝑞 ‖²
𝑛𝑝 +𝑛𝑞

Where mj was the center of cluster j, and nj was the overall number of points included in cluster j.
4. Results and discussion
4.1 OLS at the regional level
In Table 3 (a, b), I presented the OLS estimations at the regional level. All the 12 estimated OLS
models were statistically significant; in fact, the Fisher-Snedecor distribution assumed values far
higher than the tabulated critical values at the 1% level of significance. In particular, the r-square
showed that models were able to explain from 0.44% to 0.88% of CFR variability. Furthermore,
since Breusch-Pagan (1979) and Shapiro-Wilk (1965) tests allowed to accept the null hypothesis
of homoscedasticity and normality of residuals, models seemed well specified. However, due to
the small sample, I preferred to adopt a conservative approach, by applying the HC2 correction
proposed by MacKinnon and White (1985).7 It is important to stress that OLS cross-sectional
analysis is very sensitive to the presence of outliers, which can cause misspecification issues (Mur
and Lauridsen 2007), especially in such small samples (Wooldridge 2015, p. 334). Therefore, I
investigated the presence of highly influential points. The analysis revealed that none of the
leverage points (h) are beyond the cutoff value (ℎ > 2𝑛/𝑘) proposed by Belsley et al. (1980).
Finally, I also identified the presence of multicollinearity. The variance inflation factors (VIF)
ranged from 1.46 to 8.288 and were less than 10, i.e. the rule of thumb suggested by the relevant
literature (Belsley 1982; Hair et al. 1995). Therefore, I concluded that the independent variables
just suffered from weak linear dependency and there were no serious multicollinearity issues.
The results showed that the IPS index and physicians were significantly and negatively associated
with COVID-19 CFR.9 By the contrary, health expenditure, car and firm density, people aged 70
and above, humidity, DTR, prevalence, the ratio of prevalence/ordinary beds, and saturation
indexes of ordinary and critical care beds were significantly and positively correlated with the
CFR. Hospital beds, kWh per capita, and social vertical integration showed no statistical
significance. Even if the sign of health expenditure is unexpected, the IPS index seemed to
confirm the importance of health system effectiveness in all its dimensions more than only health
expenditure. The regression coefficients also gave interesting information. The change in 1 unit
of physician per 1,000 inhabitants and IPS index was correlated on average with a change of 2.87% and -0.53% in the CFR, respectively.10 Consistent with Du et al. (2020), Ioannidis et al.
(2020), Sannigrahi et al. (2020), the risk of dying increased progressively with the increase in the
elderly population. In fact, the regression coefficients of the population aged 90 and above were
4 times larger than that for the population aged 80 and above, and 8 times larger than that for the
population aged 70 and above.
Moreover, each 1 unit increase in humidity and DTR was positively associated on average with a
change of 0.28%11 and 2.22% in the CFR. The results for humidity are consistent with a recent
study by Bianconi et al. (2020) on the Italian case, while DTR outcomes are in line with Ma et al.
(2020). Prevalence and health system saturation indexes were highly significant in all the models.
In particular, saturation of ordinary beds had the largest coefficient, followed by COVID-19
7

As suggested by Erving and Long (2000, p. 220), in presence of homoskedasticity, HC2 option has good
small size properties.
8
I did not consider VIF for average temperature, which was constantly greater than 10. It is due to this that
average temperature has been excluded in most part of the models.
9
In addition, in four OLS models, the average electric power consumption is negatively associated with
the CFR. However, its coefficients are statistically significant only at the 10% level.
10
From now on, I only considered the average of the significant coefficients.
11
Model 10 also seemed to suggest that the relationship between humidity and CFR is non-monotonic. In
other words, the CFR decreased for low-medium levels of humidity and increased for high values of
humidity. However, since the lack of comprehensive data on humidity, further investigations are necessary.

prevalence, the ratio prevalence/beds, and the saturation of intensive care beds. They played the
most important role in explaining CFR variability; in fact, the average r-square of models (5–12)
with prevalence and saturation indexes was 0.81, i.e. almost twice the models (1–4) without them
(r = 0.46). In particular, the change in 0.1 unit of CCB and OB saturation was correlated with a
change of 0.47% and 4.54% in the CFR. Therefore, a significant part of the CFR may be caused
by the massive stress of the Italian health system.
Finally, the correlation matrix in Figure S1 indicated that the average temperature and humidity
were significantly and negatively correlated to the COVID-19 prevalence, with a Pearson’s r of 0.8 and -0.46, respectively. By the contrary, the kWh per capita and car and firm density showed
a good positive correlation with the latter, with a Pearson’s r of 0.66 and 0.52, respectively.
4.2 OLS at the provincial level
In Table 4 (a, b), I presented the OLS estimations at the provincial level. All 11 estimated OLS
models were statistically significant; in fact, the Fisher-Snedecor distribution assumed values far
higher than the tabulated critical values at 1% level of significance. In particular, r-square showed
that models were able to explain from 0.27% to 0.45% of CFR variability.
Since the Breusch-Pagan (1979) test revealed heteroscedasticity issues, I applied the HC2
correction. As stated by Ghasemi and Zahediasl (2012), the violation of normality assumption
should not be a major problem in a sample with enough observations (n > 40), such as in this case.
Furthermore, the variance inflation factors (VIF) ranged from 1.05 to 2.56 and are much less than
10; thus, there were no multicollinearity issues.
The OLS models showed that general practitioners, average temperature, and DTR were
significantly and negatively associated with the CFR.12 By the contrary, all the considered air
pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and O3), people aged 70 and above, prevalence, and saturation index
for ordinary beds were significantly and positively correlated with the CFR. Urbanization,
population density, and altitude showed no statistical significance. The change in 1 degree Celsius
of temperature and DTR was correlated with an average change of -0.53% and -2.44% in the
CFR, respectively. If the results for the temperature are consistent with other studies (Bianconi et
al. 2020; Rahman et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020b), the sign of DTR is unexpected and in contrast
with previous findings. Therefore, the relative impact is ambiguous and unclear.
Among air pollutants, PM2.5 and PM10 had the largest impact on COVID-19 CFR, followed by
NO2 and O3. The change in 10 μg/m3 of PM2.5 and PM10 was associated with a change of 3.13%
and 2.54% in the CFR, respectively. The change in 10 μg/m3 of NO2 was “only” correlated with
a change of 1.27% in the CFR. While, each day in which O3 exceeded the limit of 120 µg/m3, the
CFR have increased of 0.11%. The inclusion of O3 is very significant, since it allowed r-square to
increase to 0.42. The positive and significant relationship between air pollutants and CFR is
consistent with the relevant literature (Bianconi et al., 2020; Ogen, 2020; Pansini and Fornacca,
2020; Wu et al., 2020a; Yao et al., 2020). As found at the regional level, the CFR increased
progressively with population age. Specifically, 90 years old and above had a three-fold greater
risk than the 80–to–89 years old and four-fold greater risk than 70–to–79 years old. This result is
consistent with Onder et al. (2020) and assumes great importance, since the susceptibility to the
COVID-19 is constant across all age groups (Istat-ISS, 2020). The prevalence and saturation
indexes were highly and significantly correlated with the CFR in all the considered models (9–
12). Every 0.1 unit increase in COVID-19 prevalence and saturation of hospital ordinary beds
was associated with an average change of 1.66% and 0.44% in the CFR, respectively. Moreover,
the inclusion of prevalence and saturation in the models allowed an increase in the average rsquare from 0.31 to 0.43. This is consistent with the previous findings.
The correlation matrix (Figure S2) gave other interesting information, especially regarding air
pollutants. Air pollutants were highly and positively correlated with each other, with a Pearson’s
12

It is important to stress that signs for temperature and DTR didn’t change even considering the historical
values of winter. This was also true for the regional analysis.

r that ranged from 0.48 to 0.84. Moreover, consistent with Brandt (2020), population density was
moderately and positively correlated with air pollutants. Finally, as found in other studies
(Bianconi et al. 2020; Pansini and Fornacca 2020; Setti et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2020), COVID-19
prevalence and air pollutant showed a good positive correlation, with a Pearson’s r ranged from
0.36 to 0.65.
4.3 Cluster Analysis
In Figure 3, I presented the dendrogram obtained using Ward’s method. The optimal number of
clusters was identified by using two different methods: i) the EM (Expectation-Maximization)
algorithm for Gaussian finite mixture model, proposed by Fraley et al. (2012) in the package
‘Mclust’ (R environment); and iii) the package ‘NbClust’ (R environment) that proposes 30
different indexes.13 In the first case, according to BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) score, the
best model was VVI (varying volume, varying shape, and equal orientation) with 3 clusters. The
majority of indices (7 out of 30) included in ‘NbClust’, also proposed 3 clusters. Therefore, by
cutting the dendrogram at an approximately height of 13, I obtained three clusters with an
increasing risk of mortality (Table 5). Each cluster was identified with a grey dotted rectangle
(Figure 3) and represented graphically through a map (Figure 4). The cluster with the highest
mortality risk (risk = 3) was composed by 25 provinces of northern Italy, 1 province of central
Italy (Pesaro and Urbino), and 2 provinces of southern Italy (Frosinone and Avellino). The cluster
with the medium mortality risk (risk = 2) was composed by 22 provinces of northern Italy, 18
provinces of central Italy, and 6 provinces of southern Italy (Chieti, L’Aquila, Oristano, Pescara,
South Sardinia, and Teramo). Finally, the cluster with the lowest mortality risk (risk = 1) was
composed by 2 provinces of central Italy (Latina and Rome), and 31 provinces of southern Italy
(Table 6). Therefore, the highest mortality risk was concentrated in the north of the country, while
the lowest risk was associated with southern provinces. Specifically, cluster 3 had an 8.62%
higher CFR than cluster 1, and 5.3% higher CFR than cluster 2. Cluster 3 had a temperature of
2.58 degrees lower and a number of general practitioners per 1,000 inhabitants of 0.24 lower than
that for cluster 1. Moreover, cluster 3 had a PM10 of 11.23 μg/m3 higher and a proportion of
population aged 70 and abobe of 1.49% higher than that for cluster 1. Finally, the hospital bed
saturation in cluster 3 was more than double than that for cluster 2, and 8 times greater than that
for cluster 1. The results are consistent with Grasselli et al. (2020), according to which
Lombardy’s intensive care units already had an 85% to 90% occupancy ahead of the outbreak.14
5. Conclusions
To the best of my knowledge, this is one of the first studies to investigate the relationship between
a wide set of heterogeneous factors and COVID-19 mortality. The OLS analysis showed that
environmental, demographic, and healthcare factors play an important role in explaining the CFR
variability. In particular, population aging, air pollutants (NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5), relative
humidity, COVID-19 prevalence, and critical care and ordinary beds saturation are positively
correlated with the CFR. By the contrary, overall health care efficiency (IPS), physician density,
and average temperature are negatively associated with CFR. Specifically, the inclusion of the
COVID-19 prevalence and saturation indexes of ordinary and critical care beds explains up to
86% of the CFR variability. Therefore, a significant part of the CFR variability may be caused by
the massive stress of the Italian health system. The results are robust across several model
specifications. Moreover, cluster analysis showed that the highest mortality risk was concentrated
in northern Italy, while the lowest risk was associated with southern provinces.
However, this study also has some limitations that can be summarized as follows: i) first, a
significant part of the patients died in hospital presented at least one comorbidity ahead of
13
14

The outcomes of both methods are reported in the Supplementary Material (Figure S3 and Table S3).
In fact, Lombardy was the hardest hit region on April 3–4, 2020, with 40% of the Italian confirmed cases.

COVID-19 infection (ISS, 2020); ii) then, as pointed out in other studies (Spalt et al., 2016; Wang
et al., 2019), the utilization of air pollution implies unavoidable measurement errors since most
people usually stay indoors; and iii) finally, climatic variables, such as average temperature and
DTR, refer just to the average historical values.
Finally, the study seemed to stress the importance of implementing quick and rational lockdown

The parameters used are the following: patient satisfaction, active patient mobility, passive patient
mobility, legal fees for disputes, operating result, life expectancy, equality in health treatment, and
economic hardship. In particular, each parameter is standardized, with mean = 100 and standard deviation
= 10, and the final synthetic index is obtained by calculating the simple average of them.

The number of cars refers to those recorded in the Pubblico registro automobilistico (Public vehicle
register). The number of largest firms (> 250 employees) refers to those that operate in the following
sectors: (1) mining and minerals from quarries and mines; (2) manufacturing activities; (3) supply of
electricity, gas, vapors, and air conditioning; and (4) supply sewerage, waste management and remediation
activities. The index is compiled according to the following analytical method: i) first, I standardized the
data according to surface area (cars and firms for 100 sq. km.); ii) than, the respective outputs are switched
to fixed-base indexes (with mean = 100); iii) finally, I computed the simple arithmetic mean of the latter.
