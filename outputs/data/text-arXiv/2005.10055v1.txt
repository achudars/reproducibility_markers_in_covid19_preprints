Abstract
In its more severe forms, COVID-19 progresses towards an excessive immune
response, leading to the systemic overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines like IL6,
mostly from the infected lungs. This cytokine storm can cause multiple organ damage
and death. Consequently, there is a pressing need to identify therapies to treat and
prevent severe symptoms during COVID-19. Based on previous clinical evidence, we
hypothesized that inhibiting T cell co-stimulation by blocking CD80/86 could be an
effective therapeutic strategy against progression to severe proinflammatory states. To
support this hypothesis, we performed an analysis integrating blood transcriptional data
we generated from rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with abatacept -a CD80/86 costimulation inhibitor- with the pathological features associated with COVID-19,
particularly in its more severe forms. We have found that many of the biological
processes that have been consistently associated with COVID-19 pathology are
reversed by CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibition, including the downregulation of IL6
production. Also, analysis of previous transcriptional data from blood of SARS-CoVinfected patients showed that the response to abatacept has a very high level of
antagonism to that elicited by COVID-19. Finally, analyzing a recent single cell RNA-seq
dataset from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients, we found a
significant correlation along the main elements of the C80/86 axis: CD86+/80+ antigen
presenting cells, activated CD4+ T cells and IL6 production. Our in-silico study provides
additional support to the hypothesis that blocking of the CD80/CD86 signaling axis may
be protective of the excessive proinflammatory state associated with COVID-19 in the
lungs.

Introduction
Infection with SARS-CoV2 can lead to different degrees of symptomatology and severity,
ranging from asymptomatic to an extreme immune response leading to patient death (1).
The fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be close to 1%, which is 10 times more
than typical seasonal influenza (2). COVID-19 has been associated to the cytokine storm
or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (3), an overload of proinflammatory cytokines that
leads to massive organ failure, predominantly uncontrollable lung inflammation that,
even with the help of mechanical ventilation, can lead to organ collapse and death (4).
Its high capacity of dissemination and the severity stages at which it can lead, have
contributed to one of the largest pandemics since the Spanish flu in 1912 (5). There is
currently a major international effort to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV2 (6).
However, vaccine development is a lengthy process that needs to ensure both effective
virus neutralization and patient safety(7). Therefore, while vaccines are being developed,
there is a need to identify therapies that can help reduce the symptomatology associated
with COVID-19 and, mostly, prevent infected individuals from progressing into lifethreatening stages(8).
Many different strategies are being contemplated to find drugs to treat COVID-19. These
include in-silico docking strategies (9), protein-protein network interactions (10)(11), in
vitro testing (12), and also evaluation of disease progression to severe forms in patients
undergoing different therapies. In inflammatory rheumatic disease, many patients are
treated with drugs targeting specific components of the immune system (e.g. Tumor
Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF) and Interleukin-6 (IL6) signaling, and CD80/86 T cell costimulation) to dampen the excess immune activation that characterizes these diseases.
Closely evaluating these patients can provide invaluable information on how blocking
certain elements of the immune response can be beneficial or detrimental towards
COVID-19 severity. Using a cohort of 959 rheumatic patients under different targeted
therapies, we have recently provided epidemiological evidence (13) that suggests that
anti-IL6 receptor therapy (tocilizumab) and CD80/86 blockade with CTLA4-Ig (abatacept)
are associated with a lower prevalence of COVID-19 associated symptomatology as
defined by the world health organization. Given that severe COVID-19 patients express
high levels of IL6 (14), targeting the signaling of this cytokine -either directly or through
its receptor- has been contemplated and is currently being used off-label to attempt to
rescue critically ill patients (15). CTLA4-Ig, however, has not been so far proposed as a
therapeutic agent for COVID-19 severity. Abatacept is a fusion protein consisting of the
extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) linked to the

2

modified Fc domain of human IgG1 (16). It binds to both costimulatory proteins CD80
and CD86 on professional antigen presenting cells -dendritic cells, macrophages and B
cells- with higher affinity than CD28 on the surface of T cells, thereby preventing the
necessary costimulatory signal required by T cells to progress to activation. It was
originally developed to treat rheumatoid arthritis, where T cell activation is central to the
disease pathology, but has currently been approved also for psoriatic arthritis and
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (16).
In severe COVID-19, macrophages in the lung activate and produce large amounts of
IL6. Single cell analysis on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients
suggest that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages substitute alveolar macrophages
in the lung during inflammation (17). In either case, how macrophages drastically
increase the proinflammatory levels in COVID-19 is yet not known(8). High levels of Tcell mediated activation could be one of the possible causes. In turn, T cells could
become hyperactivated due to excessive activation through the CD80/86 axis (Figure
1). Therefore, dampening this activation signaling pathway could be an effective
therapeutic approach to prevent immune system hyperactivation, and progress to more
severe stages. To support this hypothesis raised by the findings of our previous
epidemiological survey in rheumatic patients, here we performed an in-silico study using
transcriptional data from abatacept-treated patients as well as from COVID-19 patients.
Our data support a significant antagonism of abatacept on COVID-19-associated
processes at the systemic level, and suggest that blocking the CD80/86 axis could be a
useful therapeutic approach to reduce the level of macrophage-associated inflammatory
response.

Methods
Patients and samples
A total of n=38 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients starting treatment with abatacept were
recruited in the framework of the PACTABA project (BMS). All patients were treated with
subcutaneous abatacept at the recommended weekly dosage of 125 mg. The PACTABA
project is a multicentric Spanish pharmacogenomic study performed in a subset of
patients from the ASCORE clinical trial (Bristol-Myers Squibb, ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT02090556). This observational and prospective study was designed to
estimate the retention rate of subcutaneous abatacept over 24 months in the routine

3

clinical practice of RA patients (18). The study was approved by the institutional review
board and informed consent was obtained in all cases.
Whole blood samples were obtained at the start of the therapy with abatacept and at
week 12. Blood was collected using RNA-stabilizing PaxGene tubes (PreAnalytiX,
Switzerland), which preserve total RNA from the time of venipuncture. Total RNA was
extracted using the PaxGene blood isolation kit (Qiagen). All samples had a RIN index
> 7 and were included for RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq libraries were performed using
with the KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit, with RiboErase (HMR) Globin (globin and rRNA
depletion protocol) for Illumina sequencing platforms and with the addition of Unique
Molecule Identifiers (UMIs). Sequencing was performed using the NovaSeq platform
(Illumina) at average of 250 paired-end reads.
RNA data preprocessing
For our RA patient cohort, FASTQ files were aligned to the GRCh37 human reference
genome assembly using STAR (19). After alignment, we performed deduplication of the
PCR duplicates using UMItools (20) to mark and after removing with samtools (21).
Gene-level read counts of the deduplicated bam files were obtained with featureCounts
(22). The RA longitudinal dataset will be made available through the NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus database (GEO link available after data has been deposited).
To characterize the gene expression profile associated with COVID-19, the RNA-seq
data from Xiong et al on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from three patients
infected with COVID-19 and three healthy controls was used (23). The raw sequencing
data was processed as described previously. In order to infer the purity and cell
composition of this dataset, we used the ABIS immune cell deconvolution method which
has been specifically developed for PBMC data (24). This analysis revealed potential
neutrophil presence, particularly in one sample (Supplementary Figure 1). To
compensate for this potential confounding effect, the estimated percentage of
granulocytes was used as a covariate in the differential expression analysis.
Differential expression and gene set enrichment analysis
Genes differentially expressed in COVID-19 patients were determined using edgeR (25).
Raw counts were normalized by trimmed mean of mean values (TMM) normalization,
and genes with low expression values (i.e. < 2 counts per million -CPM- in at least 2
samples). Differentially expressed genes were determined by fitting a quasi-likelihood

4

negative binomial generalized linear model and adjusting for multiple testing by
Benjamini & Hochberg (26). Genes with an adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered
significant.
To test for gene expression changes induced by treatment with abatacept at a systemic
level, the differential expression between baseline and week 12 was tested in RA
patients using limma (27). Raw counts were normalized using TMM normalization for all
genes with > 0.6 CPM in at least 20 samples. Normalized counts were log-transformed
to log-counts using voom (28) and a linear model was fitted blocking by individual and
adding sex, age and batch (i.e. library plate) as covariates. The percentage of
granulocytes in each sample were estimated using DeconCell (29), and also included as
a covariate in the model in order to make the results more directly comparable with the
results obtained with the COVID-19 dataset.
Biological processes affected either by SARS-CoV-2 infection or treatment with
abatacept were determined using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)(30)
implemented in the fGSEA R package. To rank the genes based on their association to
COVID-19 and abatacept, the minus log of the p-value of the differential expression
analysis was calculated and multiplied by the sign of the log fold change as described
previously (31). We included the sign of the log fold change in order to preserve the
directionality of the enrichment and, therefore, to be able to determine if the biological
process was either activated or repressed by the viral infection and by the treatment with
abatacept. Biological processes with a FDR < 0.05 and a normalized enrichment score
(NES) > 0 were considered to be up regulated, while biological processes with a FDR <
0.05 and a NES < 0 were considered to be down regulated.
Analysis of the antagonism of the abatacept signature to COVID-19 associated
processes
To identify COVID-19 biological processes we used two alternative strategies. In the first,
we identified a list of biological processes that have been associated to COVID-19
pathology through diverse clinical and biological studies. In particular, biological
processes that have been associated with COVID-19 severity were prioritized. Those
pathological processes that were unlikely to be captured at the blood transcriptional level
(e.g. lung fibrosis) were excluded. A total of 22 processes were finally selected, which
are divided in a group of 6 processes related to viral immune sensing and anti-viral
response (i.e. first stage of COVID-19)(5), and a group of 16 processes related to
hyperinflammation and severity (i.e. second stage)(32)(3)(33)(34). Table 1 describes the

5

selected processes and the most relevant bibliographical evidence. To evaluate their
modulation by abatacept, we selected a representative gene set from the Biological
Process (BP) database from the Gene Ontology (GO)(35) and tested their association
to treatment with GSEA as described previously.
In the second approach, we used the available PBMC transcriptional data generated
from COVID-19 patients and controls (14) to determine the biological processes
associated with COVID-19. Similarly, biological processes regulated by abatacept at the
systemic level were determined by comparing the baseline gene expression of RA
patients to the expression after 12 weeks of treatment with abatacept. To avoid testing
BPs represented by very low gene numbers or excessive gene content (too broad
process annotation), we selected only GO terms with > 10 genes and < 300 genes. To
account for the large number of GO terms tested, a false-discovery rate (FDR)
adjustment was performed. GO terms with FDR < 0.05 were considered significant.
Since many GO terms can be very similar in their gene composition, we reduced the
redundancy in the analyzed gene sets using a distance measure based on the Jaccard
index and hierarchical clustering. Within each cluster, the GO term showing the highest
association to COVID was chosen to represent the corresponding biological process.
Single cell RNA-seq analysis of COVID-19 BALF cells
In order to evaluate the potential utility of CTLA4-Ig blockade of CD80/86 T cell signaling
in COVID-19-mediated lung inflammation, we analyzed single cell RNA-seq data from
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells. Single-cell RNA-seq raw data from BALF
samples from 9 COVID-19 patients (n=6 severe and n=3 mild) and 3 controls were
downloaded from the GEO database (accession GSE145926). This dataset was
generated using the 10x genomics platform and includes samples used in a publication
demonstrating the predominant influx of monocyte-derived macrophages in COVID-19
patients (17). The raw data processing and analysis -including, normalization, scaling,
and clustering of cells- was performed using Seurat (v3)(36)(37) and scTransform (38).
Cells with <200 or >6,000 unique feature counts, >10% mitochondrial counts or < 1,000
UMIs were filtered out. Samples were log-normalized and scaled for the number of
genes, number of UMIs and percentage of mitochondrial reads. Cell type clustering was
performed using the “FindClusters” function from Seurat. In brief, this method uses a
shared nearest neighbour (SNN) modularity optimization-based clustering algorithm to
identify clusters of cells based on their PCs. Before constructing the SNN graph, this
function calculates the k-nearest neighbours. The number of PCs used for each

6

clustering round (k=50) was estimated by the evaluation of the elbow of the PCA scree
plot.

Results
The transcriptional changes induced by CD80/86 blocking antagonize COVID-19
associated processes
In our first approach, we evaluated how COVID-19 pathological processes were affected
by treatment with CTLA4-Ig at the transcriptional level. Of the 22 curated processes, we
found that abatacept induced transcriptional changes in 16 of them (72.7%, binomial test
P=8.5e-17). All significant changes occurred in the opposite direction to that described
by previous clinical and experimental studies on COVID-19 Figures 2A and 2B show
the observed changes induced by CTLA4-Ig in the anti-viral primary response and
hyperinflammation biological processes, respectively. Figures 3A and 3B show a
detailed visualization of the differential gene expression for the selected pathological
processes representing anti-viral immune response and hyperinflammation-mediated
severity, respectively.
In our second approach, we identified a total of 260 pathways differentially activated in
COVID-19 patients compared to controls (FDR < 0.05) (Supplementary Table 1). These
pathways were mostly associated to phagocytosis, endocytosis and lysosome function,
immunoglobulin mediated immunity, antigen processing and presentation, acute
inflammatory response and cytokine cascades (i.e. IL1, IL6 and IL8 production, TNF
signaling, type I and type II interferon signaling, NF-kB signaling and macrophage
activation), metabolic processes, mitochondrial activity, cell cycle, response to reactive
oxygen species and apoptosis. Other interesting pathways included the down-regulation
of T cell receptor signaling, the over-activation of the cellular response to angiotensin,
the up regulation of transferrin transport and the regulation of blood pressure.
In the RA patient cohort, comparing week 12 to baseline gene expression profiles, we
found 109 pathways associated with CTLA4-Ig therapy (FDR < 0.05, Supplementary
Table 2). These pathways were associated predominantly to cell cycle and cell division,
myeloid cell differentiation, antigen processing and presentation, immunoglobulin
mediated immunity, acute inflammatory response, cytokine cascades (IL7 and IL6),
phagocytosis, endocytosis and lysosome function, ribosomal RNA related processes
and apoptosis. Comparing the two datasets, we found a total of 49 overlapping significant
pathways (Figure 4). From these, 47 (96%) were found to be antagonistically activated
by abatacept compared to COVID-19. Among the significant antagonistic processes, we

7

found 16 pathways related to immune system processes including processes related to
viral defense (viral transcription, GO:0019083), innate immune system activation (Fc
receptor

signaling

pathway,

GO:0038093;

myeloid

leukocyte

differentiation:

GO:0002573) and acquired immune response (regulation of B cell activation,
GO:0050864;

humoral immune response mediated by circulating immunoglobulin,

GO:0002455) and cytokine production (interleukin-6 production; GO:0032635). Other
abundant significant processes included those related with cell cycle and RNA
transcription (n=18) and with endocytosis (n=5). Only one pathway (mitochondrial
translational elongation, GO:0070125) was activated and one process (mucosal immune
response: GO:0002385) was inactivated by both exposures. The probability that the
observed antagonism occurred by chance, is very low (P value < 2.5e-18, binomial test).
Figure 5 shows the most significant processes antagonized by CD80/86 blocking with
abatacept. The complete list of overlapping -antagonistic and agonistic- pathways is
included in Supplementary Table 3.
scRNA-seq analysis of CD80/86 axis in BALF
In order to evaluate the relevance of CD80/86 co-stimulation in COVID-19 pathology we
analyzed the correlation of three key cell types participating in this axis: CD80+ or CD86+
antigen-presenting cells, activated CD4+ T cells and IL6-producing macrophages. For
this objective we analyzed a recent scRNA-seq dataset generated from 12 BALF
samples (17).This dataset consists on samples from six severe and three moderate
COVID-19 patients, as well as a set of CD45+ selected BALF cells from healthy controls.
In total, 54,420 cells passed our quality control analysis and were analyzed using the
scTransform algorithm (38). With this approach a total of 34 cell clusters were identified
(Figure 6).
Most of the cell clusters aggregated into four major regions representing i) T and NK
cells (8,014 cells, 14.7%, clusters 9, 11, 5, 25 and 18), ii) two regions of FABP4+ alveolar
macrophage cells (17,399 cells, 32%, clusters 1, 2, 3, 30, 7, 32 and 12), and iii) a large
cluster aggregate of active, IL6-expressing macrophages both from FABP4+ alveolar
and monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages (24,742 cells, 45.5%, clusters 6, 20, 13, 22,
0, 8, 4, 15, 10, 16, 14, 26). Both alveolar macrophage-only clusters belong to the three
healthy controls (Supplementary Figure 2). As described by the original study(17),
there is a marked transition from FABP4+ alveolar macrophages to FCN1+ monocytederived macrophages from healthy to infected, and as COVID-19 severity increases
(Figure 7 A).

8

When looking at the co-stimulation proteins that are the target of CTLA4-Ig -CD80 and
CD86- we found that healthy controls had a significantly lower expression of both
proteins (Figure 7 B). This difference was high for CD86 (26.5% CD86+ in controls vs
45.4% in COVID-19 infected patients, P<1e-16) and drastically different for CD80+ cells
(1.7% CD86+ in controls vs 19.6% in COVID-19 infected patients, P<1e-16). Next, we
identified the set of cells showing production of IL6, the key cytokine in COVID-19
severity and the cytokine storm. Among the different BALF cell clusters, we found IL6expressing cells almost exclusively in the activated macrophage cluster derived from
COVID19 patients (Figure 7 C). Finally, we identified the cluster containing the CD4+ T
cell element of the CD80/86 axis. Cluster 5 was found to aggregate markers of different
types of CD4+ T cells including CCR7 (naïve TCD4), IL2RA (Treg), FOXP3 (Treg), IL7R
(naive), LTB (naive), CXCL13(T peripheral helper) (Figure 7D). This cell cluster also was
characterized by the expression of CTLA4, the protein that is recombined in abatacept
and also a marker that is highly upregulated in active T cells and Treg cells (39), and
was therefore used to represent the CD80/CD86 activated T CD4+ element.
We next tested for association between the simultaneous presence of each element, of
the CD80/86 axis. First, we found a significant correlation between CD80+ or CD86+
APCs and active CD4+ T cells (r2=0.87, P=0.00036; and r2=0.73, P=0.0069) (Figure 8A
and Figure 8B). Second, we also found evidence of correlation (r2=0.79, P=0.0024)
between the number of activated CD4+ T cells and the number of IL6 producing cells
(Figure 8C). Finally, we found a significant correlation between the number of CD80+ or
CD86+ cells and IL6+ production (r2=0.93, P=1.5e-7, and r2=0.82, P=0.0011,
respectively) (Figure 8D).

as

of

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). There is currently a pressing need to identify
therapies that can help prevent and treat patients with more severe symptoms of COVID19. Based on previous epidemiological evidence from rheumatic treated patients on
several targeted immunomodulators, we have found evidence that CTLA4-Ig (abatacept)
could be protective of COVID-19 symptomatology. Here we provide additional in-silico
evidence to support the link between the relevance of the CD80/86 axis and COVID-19.
We have characterized the transcriptional response of abatacept-treated RA patients
and we have found that is highly antagonistic to key biological processes that have been
linked to COVID-19 severity. Using gene expression data from COVID-19 infected

9

patients, we have also found that this antagonism extends significantly to many other
biological processes induced by SARS-CoV2 virus infection. Finally, analyzing single cell
data from BALF samples, we have found evidence that the CD80/86 axis is closely linked
to IL6 expression in the BALF macrophage compartment in COVID-19.
Our results suggest that blocking the CD80/86 axis could be useful to dampen the
hyperactivation of the immune response in severe COVID-19, and subsequently reduce
the damage to the lungs and the excessive systemic cytokine production. Once SARSCoV2 enters the lung through attachment to ACE2 expressed on alveolar epithelial cells
(40)(41), an immune response is subsequently mounted. Central to this response,
phagocytic cells, initially alveolar macrophages that are eventually replaced by massively
infiltrating monocytes (17), are highly activated, releasing a large number of cytokines.
Macrophages act as powerful antigen-presenting cells (APCs) on activated CD4+ T cells
to further amplify the level of immune response. For this objective, the co-stimulatory
signal in the form of CD80 and CD86 expression in the surface of APCs is essential,
otherwise an anergic program is initiated (42). From all organs, the lung is the tissue with
the highest levels of CD80 mRNA, and the second tissue after the spleen with the highest
levels of CD86 mRNA expression (Supplementary Figure 3). Even CTLA4 itself is
highly expressed in the lung compared to the rest of tissues. This high expression of the
elements of the CD80/86 axis might reflect the need of the lung to respond rapidly to
potential immunological insults in a tissue that is constantly exposed to environmental
cues (43). However, having this natively high potential for antigen presentation and T
cell activation could be a detrimental factor in a rapidly spreading virus like SARS-CoV2.
A larger cell mass capable of activating T cells would in turn lead to a more pronounced
stimulation of IL6 producing programs (44). This high signal amplification potential could
therefore explain the sudden transition into the extremely high cytokine production stage
known as cytokine storm (45).
In our analysis approach, treatment with CTLA4-Ig showed a regulation at the
transcriptional level that is highly antagonistic to that induced by COVID-19. We have
shown this by two complementary strategies. In the first strategy we have found that,
from the most well-established pathological processes associated with COVID-19 to
date, abatacept induces a transcriptional change that is contrary to the one induced by
the virus in most of them. In a first group of processes related to innate immune system
detection of SARS-CoV2 we found that treatment with abatacept downregulates TLRsignaling pathway and endosomal transport. TLRs are key to detect the presence of the
virus, leading to the activation of proinflammatory transcription factors and the

10

expression of IFN and other cytokines(46). While viral detection is essential to trigger the
immune response in the first stages of the infection, later its utility might be superseded
by the need to adequately control excessive inflammatory response (5). To this regard,
our analysis did not detect a strong type I IFN inhibition, thereby suggesting that this
basic anti-viral mechanism is protected. Of interest, we found a significant
downregulation of endosomal transport, a biological process that has been linked to the
possible protective of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 (33). A reduction endosomal
development and maturation would keep at stake viral load. However, the confirmation
of this mechanism in relation to SARS-CoV2 infection and the clinical protection are still
controversial and are in need of robust evidence (47).
Abatacept inhibits many biological pathways that are key to the hyperinflammatory stage.
As described previously, the immune response to SARS-CoV2 can be divided into two
phases, one first phase where the antiviral response is deployed and a second phase of
excessive inflammatory response (27). The latter might not activate in many infected
patients, but likely occurs in most of those who progress to more severe symptoms,
particularly those with increasing lung inflammation. This stage is characterized by the
activation of myeloid cells, mostly monocyte-derived macrophages that massively
infiltrate the lung (8). We have found that treatment with CTLA4-Ig significantly downregulates myeloid leukocyte differentiation and macrophage activation. This specific antiinflammatory role could be a useful property to avoid entering into the life-threatening
massive cytokine release stage. To this regard, we have found that abatacept
downregulated both the production and the response to several key cytokines of the
severe stage in COVID-19 including TNF (48), IL1 (33), IL8 (49), IL7 (48) and IL6 (48).
Importantly, we have found that downregulation is strong for IL6, the cytokine that is
more abundantly produced in patients progressing to severity both in serum and in the
lungs (45). Therapies aimed at IL6 signaling, tocilizumab and sarilumab, are currently
being evaluated in at least three clinical trials by 11th May 2020, and there is increasing
reporting of beneficial effects in off-label use in severe patients (50). In line with this, our
previous epidemiological study, both CD80/86 blocking and anti-IL6R therapies showed
the lowest incidence of COVID-19 suspected cases among rheumatic patients (13).
Consequently, the potential beneficial effect of CTLA4-Ig could be due to the upstream
regulatory effect of this central cytokine for COVID-19 pathogenesis.
Abatacept also strongly downregulated two additional immune processes: complement
activation and B cell mediated immunity. Complement over-activation has been identified
in the lungs of COVID-19 and antibody therapies against elements of the complement

11

system are being currently being evaluated to treat severe cases (32). The
downregulation of the B cell mediated response, could also be beneficial to avoid
overactivation of the myeloid compartment. While neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV
are associated to a reduction in the viral load (51), there is also the possibility that high
titers antibodies could lead to a more aggressive immunological response. During the
SARS-CoV1 epidemic, neutralizing antibody levels were higher in deceased patients
(52), which raised the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) contributing
to disease exacerbation. In this situation, non-neutralizing antibodies facilitate the
phagocytosis of the virus into macrophage through the Fc-receptor leading to their
activation into proinflammatory phenotypes (53). ADE has been previously identified in
other coronaviruses (54)(55), and experimental evidence in rhesus macaques infected
with SARS-CoV1 found that anti-spike IgG antibodies contributed to massive influx of
monocytes in the lung and subsequent severe acute injury (56). In this context, the effect
of reducing B cell immunity by abatacept might be beneficial by reducing the likelihood
of low-affinity antibodies that would contribute to ADE-induction (7). To this regard,
evidence showing that antibodies raised against SARS-Cov2 can lead to ADE would be
of high relevance, particularly in the development of safe vaccines.
The results of this study are entirely in the in-silico domain and therefore they must be
considered as additional evidence on top of increasing evidence from the clinical domain.
Consequently, additional independent data from large patient cohorts will be useful to
confirm this hypothesis. For example, the Global Rheumatology Alliance (57), an
international collaborative initiative that is currently aggregating data from patients
around the world, will likely become an ideal resource to confirm the observed lower atrisk incidence in abatacept-treated rheumatic patients (13). Among the limitations of this
study is that our analysis of transcriptional changes due to abatacept could have been
confounded by the specific immune activation that is due to RA. Like SARS, however,
RA is a disease where macrophage IL6 production is central to the pathology (58). Of
relevance, there is increasing evidence that abatacept could be an efficacious therapy
to treat interstitial lung disease in RA (ILD) (59). ILD is a comorbidity that occurs in RA
patients and is characterized by the inflammation and subsequent fibrotic development
of the lung tissue. Treatment with abatacept was motivated by the finding that blocking
T cell co-stimulation through CTLA4-Ig is effective in a mouse model of hypersensitivity
pneumonitis (60), a disease characterized by a massive influx of activated T cells in the
lungs and where alveolar macrophages express high levels of B7 (CD80/CD86)
molecules. This evidence is in line with our hypothesis that the CD80/86 axis is a key
factor for lung hyperinflammatory response. Additionally, while immunosuppressive

12

agents are generally associated with an increase in the risk of infectious diseases in
rheumatic patients (61), abatacept has shown to be the therapy that least increases this
risk. There is substantial epidemiological evidence supporting that abatacept-treated
patients do not increase the risk of serious infections (62)(63)(64).
Our finding that abatacept-treated patients have a lower percentage of COVID-19
symptoms, prompted us to provide additional evidence of the benefit of this therapeutic
approach. After characterizing the transcriptional changes induced by the therapy in a
cohort of RA patients, we have seen that it is highly antagonistic to that induced by
COVID-19, both to several of the most well-known pathological processes associated
with the disease, and to the biological processes that are differentially activated in
samples of patients. Together, this evidence identifies blocking of the CD80/86 axis as
a candidate therapy for COVID-19. To this regard, Belatacept, a CTLA4-Ig drug derived
from abatacept that binds more avidly to CD80/86 and is used to prevent renal transplant
rejection (65), could be a therapeutic alternative. However, there’s yet no epidemiological
evidence evaluating this drug in relation to COVID-19, with only sporadic reporting (66).
While the development of vaccines and the questions like permanency of immunization
are still being investigated, there is a need to find therapies that can lower the risk of
progressing to severe stages of COVID-19 and reduce the number of fatalities during
the next months or years. Additional clinical and experimental evidence gathered in the
next months will be crucial to confirm if blocking of the CD80/86 axis is a useful
therapeutic approach to prevent progression to severe stages of the disease.

Data and code availability
The whole code used to analyze the PBMC RNA-Seq data from COVID-19 infected
patients, blood RNA-Seq data from RA patients treated with abatacept and the BALF
single-cell RNA-Seq dataset is freely available at https://github.com/RheumatologyResearch-Group/COVID-19_Abatacept. The dataset generated during this study will be
deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. CTLA4-Ig (abatacept) dampens T cell co-stimulation and excessive
cytokine production in COVID-19. Schematics depicting the model for abataceptmediated inhibition of excess cytokine production. Once lungs become infected with
SARS-CoV2 virus, an immune response is mounted. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) in
the lung present antigen to activated CD4+ T cells thereby stimulating their production
of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF, IL6). Resident alveolar macrophages and,
mostly, large numbers of infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages respond to the T
cell stimulation by producing large quantities of interleukins, mainly IL6. Large numbers
of activated macrophages present in the lung can lead to systemic secretion of IL6,
forming the cytokine storm. Treatment with CTLA4-Ig recombinant fusion protein could
dampen APC activation of T cells and, therefore, reduce the level of hyperinflammatory
response observed in severe COVID-16 patients.
Figure 2. Longitudinal transcriptional changes induced by CTLA4-Ig therapy in
COVID-19 associated processes. A. Changes in biological processes associated with
immune viral response. B. Changes in biological processes associated with
hyperinflammation and severity in COVID-19. The first column on the left indicates the
direction of change of the biological process by COVID19 as described in different clinical
and experimental studies (blue: up-regulation, red: down-regulation). As a reference, we
include the transcriptional changes observed for the same set of processes in the
COVID-19 PBMC samples (middle column). Finally, the third column shows the change
induced by treatment with abatacept in RA patients. Up-regulation (blue) and downregulation (red) is depicted according to effect size (diameter of circle). Statistical
significance is reflected as color intensity and p-value levels according to *<0.05,
**<0.005, ***<0.0005, ****<0.00005 and *****<0.000005.

B. Immune processes associated with COVID-19 severity stages. Volcano-plots showing
the statistical significance (-log10(p-value), y-axis) against the effect size (log fold
change, x-axis) for all genes. In color are highlighted the genes from the specific
biological processes, red for genes down-regulated by abatacept, and blue for genes upregulated by abatacept.
Figure 4. Venn plot of the biological processes regulated by COVID-19 and by
abatacept. Numbers represent the biological processes that are specific and those that
are commonly changed by both exposures. From the latter, 47 processes modified by
COVID-19 are antagonistically modified by abatacept, compared to only 2 processes
that are agonistically induced by co-stimulation inhibition.
Figure 5. Most significant COVID-19 transcriptional processes antagonized by
abatacept. The 20 top biological processes more significantly down or up-regulated by
COVID-19 at the transcriptional level and also more significantly antagonized by
abatacept are shown in this diagram. Up-regulation (blue) and down-regulation (red) is
depicted according to effect size (diameter of circle). Statistical significance is reflected
as color intensity and p-value levels according to *<0.05, **<0.005, ***<0.0005,
****<0.00005 and *****<0.000005.
Figure 6. UMAP of the BALF samples from COVID-19 and healthy control
individuals. Total cell BALF samples from 6 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 infected
individuals and 3 CD45+ sorted BALF samples from 3 healthy controls were analyzed
for cell cluster identification. Each number depicts each of the 34 cell clusters identified
using the SNN approach implemented in Seurat v3.

respectively. The two cluster aggregates that entirely express FABP4 correspond of cells
from healthy controls. B. Expression of co-stimulating protein genes CD80 and CD86,
which are the target of abatacept. While CD86 has a more ubiquitous expression
(including both FCN1+ and FABP4+ macrophages), CD80 is specifically expressed in
FCN1+ monocyte-derived macrophages. C. IL6 expression is circumscribed to the

Cell coloring is based on the 12 individuals simultaneously analyzed in the BALF scRNASeq study. Samples C51, C52 and C100 correspond to the three controls, which clearly
show distinct clusters of FABP4+ alveolar macrophage cells. The remaining samples are
from COVID-19 patients with 3 samples from mild patients (C141, C142 and C144) and
6 samples from patients with severe disease (C143, C145, C146, C148, C149, C152).
Supplementary Figure 3.

Tissue-level gene expression distribution for CD80,

CD86 and CTLA4 genes from GTex database. The distribution of gene expression
levels for the three key genes from 53 human tissues from nearly 1,000 individuals are
shown (GTex database, version 8). All three key genes from the CD80/86 axis are highly
expressed in the lung, being the first tissue for CD80, the second for CD86 and the third
for CTLA4 mRNAs.
