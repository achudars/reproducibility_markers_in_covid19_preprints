Aerosolized droplets play a central role in the transmission of various infectious diseases, including Legionnaire’s
disease, gastroenteritis-causing norovirus, and most recently COVID-19. Respiratory droplets are known to be the
most prominent source of transmission for COVID-19, however, alternative routes may exist given the discovery of
small numbers of viable viruses in urine and stool samples. Flushing biomatter can lead to the aerosolization of
microorganisms, thus, there is a likelihood that bioaerosols generated in public restrooms may pose a concern for the
transmission of COVID-19, especially since these areas are relatively confined, experience heavy foot traffic, and may
suffer from inadequate ventilation. To quantify the extent of aerosolization, we measure the size and number of droplets
generated by flushing toilets and urinals in a public restroom. The results indicate that the particular designs tested in
the study generate a large number of droplets in the size range 0.3µm to 3µm, which can reach heights of at least
1.52m. Covering the toilet reduced aerosol levels but did not eliminate them completely, suggesting that aerosolized
droplets escaped through small gaps between the cover and the seat. In addition to consistent increases in aerosol levels
immediately after flushing, there was a notable rise in ambient aerosol levels due to the accumulation of droplets from
multiple flushes conducted during the tests. This highlights the need for incorporating adequate ventilation in the design
and operation of public spaces, which can help prevent aerosol accumulation in high occupancy areas and mitigate the
risk of airborne disease transmission.

INTRODUCTION

The aerosolization of biomatter caused by flushing toilets has long been known to be a potential source of transmission of infectious microorganisms1,2 . Toilet flushing can
generate large quantities of microbe-containing aerosols3 depending on the design and water pressure or flushing energy
of the toilet4–6 . A variety of different pathogens which are
found in stagnant water or in waste products (e.g., urine, feces, and vomit) can get dispersed widely via such aerosolization, including the legionella bacterium responsible for causing Legionnaire’s disease7,8 , the Ebola virus9 , the norovirus
which causes severe gastroenteritis (food poisoning)10,11 , and
the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV)12 . Such airborne dispersion is suspected to have played
a key role in the outbreak of viral gastroenteritis aboard a
cruise ship, where infection was twice as prevalent among
passengers who used shared toilets compared to those who
had private bathrooms13 . Similarly, transmission of norovirus
via aerosolized droplets was linked to the occurrence of vomiting or diarrhea within an aircraft restroom14 , as passengers
and crew who got infected were more likely to have visited
restrooms than those that were not infected. The participants
in the study reported that all of the restroom surfaces appeared

to be clean, which indicates that infection is likely to have occurred via bioaerosols suspended within the restroom.
In more controlled studies investigating toilet-generated
aerosols, Barker & Bloomfield15 isolated salmonella bacteria from air samples collected after flushing. Bacteria and
viruses could be isolated from settle plates for up to an hour to
90 minutes after flushing16,17 , suggesting that the microorganisms were present in aerosolized droplets and droplet nuclei.
An experimental study in a hospital-based setting measured
bioaerosol generation when fecal matter was flushed by patients18 . A significant increase in bioaerosols was observed
right after flushing, and the droplets remained detectable for
up to 30 minutes afterwards. Notably, flushing does not remove all of the microorganisms which may be present in the
bowl. In various studies where the toilet bowl was seeded with
microorganisms, sequential flushes led to a drop in microbe
count, however, some residual microbes remained in the bowl
even after up to 24 flushes2,15,16,19,20 . In some cases, residual microbial contamination was shown to persist in biofilm
formed within the toilet bowl for several days to weeks15 .
In an effort to reduce aerosol dispersal, certain studies conducted measurements with the toilet seat lid closed16,17 . Closing the lid led to a decrease, but not a complete absence of bacteria recovered from air samples. This suggests that smaller
aerosolized droplets were able to escape through the gap between the seat and the lid. In addition to the experiment-based
studies mentioned here, numerical simulations have been used
recently to investigate the ejection of aerosolized particles
from toilets and urinals, specifically in the context of COVID19 transmission21,22 .
The issue of aerosolization is particularly acute for viruses
compared to bacteria, given their different response to levels of relative-humidity (RH). High RH levels result in slower

2
evaporation of aerosolized droplets, whereas lower levels accelerate the phenomenon, leading to the formation of extremely small droplet nuclei which can remain airborne for
long periods of time and can deposit deep into the lungs23,24 .
Various studies have indicated that the viability of bacteria decreases at low RH levels25,26 , which makes them less likely to
retain their infectivity in droplet nuclei form. On the other
hand, viruses exhibit lowest viability at intermediate RH levels, and retain their viability at either low or high RH values26–30 , making them more likely to remain intact in droplet
nuclei which can stay suspended from hours to days. Viruses
are also more likely to aerosolize easily, as indicated by Lee at
al.31 who used wastewater sludge (both synthetic and real) to
demonstrate that when viruses were seeded into the sludge,
94% stayed mobile in the liquid phase while only a small
fraction adhered to the solid biomatter or to the surfaces of
the toilet. This suggests that the presence of solid biomatter,
which is more difficult to aerosolize, might not reduce the potential for virus transmission since they are more likely to get
aerosolized with the liquid phase.
Apart from gastrointestinal diseases, viruses associated
with respiratory illnesses have also been detected in patients’
stool and urine samples. For instance, the SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) responsible
for the SARS outbreak of 2003 was found in patients’ urine
and stool specimens for longer than 4 weeks32 . Similarly,
recent studies have confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2
(the virus associated with COVID-19) viral RNA in patients’
stool samples33–38 , even if they did not experience gastrointestinal symptoms and regardless of the severity of their respiratory symptoms34,35,39,40 . Surprisingly, viral RNA could
be detected in feces for several days to weeks after it was no
longer detectable in respiratory samples from nasal and oral
swabs33–35,38 . Moreover, Wu et al.41 recovered large quantities of viral RNA from urban wastewater treatment facilities. The levels detected were several orders of magnitude
higher than would be expected for the number of clinically
confirmed cases in the region, which suggests that there was a
high prevalence of asymptomatic and undetected cases.
Although enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are susceptible to the acids and bile salts found in digestive juices, it has
been shown that they can survive when engulfed within mucus produced by the digestive system. Hirose et al.42 demonstrated that influenza viruses could be protected from degradation by simulated digestive juices using both artificial and
natural mucus. This might help explain why recent studies
have been able to isolate viable SARS-CoV-2 virus particles
(i.e., those able to infect new cells) that remained intact when
passing through the digestive and urinary systems, albeit in
smaller quantities compared to respiratory fluids43 . Wang et
al.44 detected live virus in feces from patients who did not
have diarrhea, and Xiao et al.45 demonstrated the infectivity
of intact virions isolated from a patient’s stool samples. In
urine specimens, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is found less frequently
than in fecal and respiratory samples33,40,46 . However, Sun
et al.47 managed to isolate the virus from a severely infected
patient’s urine, and showed that these virions were capable of
infecting new susceptible cells. As with fecal samples, viral

RNA has been found in urine even after the virus is no longer
detectable in respiratory swabs40 .
These findings suggest that the aerosolization of biomatter could play a potential role in the transmission of SARSCoV-2, which is known to remain viable in aerosol form48,49 .
Environmental samples taken by Ding et al.50 in a hospital
designated specifically for COVID-19 patients indicated high
prevalence of the virus within bathrooms used by the patients,
both on surfaces and in air samples. The authors hypothesized that aerosolized fecal matter may have dispersed the
virus within the bathroom, since viral samples were not detected on surfaces in the patients’ rooms.
Given the potential role of aerosolized biomatter in spreading a wide variety of gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses,
we investigate droplet generation from toilets and urinals in a
public restroom operating under normal ventilation condition.
We examine the size, number, and various heights to which
the droplets rise when generated by the flushing water. The
main aim is to better understand the risk of infection transmission that the droplets pose in public restrooms, since these
relatively confined locations often experience heavy foot traffic. The experimental methodology is described in Section II
followed by results and discussion in Section III and conclusion in Section IV.

METHODS

The flush-generated aerosol measurements were recorded
in a medium sized restroom on the university campus, consisting of 3 bathroom cubicles, 6 urinals, and 3 sinks. The
restroom was deep cleaned and closed twenty four hours prior
to conducting the experiments, with the ventilation system
operating normally to remove any aerosols generated during
cleaning. The temperature and relative humidity within the
restroom were measured to be 21◦C and 52%, respectively.
For the measurements reported here, one particular toilet and
one urinal were selected, both equipped with flushometer type
flushing systems. The urinal used 3.8 liters of water per flush
whereas the toilet used 4.8 liters per flush.
The size and concentration of aerosols generated by flushing were measured using a handheld particle counter (9306V2 - TSI Incorporated). The sensor’s size resolution is less
than 15%, which is indicative of the uncertainty in the measured particle diameter. More specifically, the resolution is
specified as the ratio of standard deviation to the mean size
of the particles being sampled. The counting efficiency of the
sensor is 50% at 0.3µm and 100% for particles larger than
0.45µm. These values denote the ratio of particle numbers
measured by the counter to those measured using a reference
instrument. Handheld counters with comparable specifications have been used for estimating the likelihood of aerosol
transmission in typical public spaces51 .
The particle counter was positioned at various heights close
to the toilet and the urinal as shown in Figure 1. Measurements for the toilet were taken at 3 different heights, at approximately 0.43m from the ground (1 f t 5in), 1.22m (4 f t),
and 1.52m (5 f t), with the toilet seat raised up. The low-

were taken at 0.53m (1 f t 9in), 0.97m (3 f t 2in), and 1.22m (4 f t).

est level corresponds to the distance between the ground and
the toilet seat, and represents the scenario where the particle counter was placed level with the seat. Measurements for
the urinal were taken at 3 different heights, at approximately
0.53m from the ground (1 f t 9in), 0.97m (3 f t 2in), and 1.22m
(4 f t). The particle counter’s intake probe was oriented parallel to the floor and perpendicular to the back wall, with the
inlet pointing in the direction of the flushing water. The probe
was centered laterally for both toilet and urinal measurements.
The placement and orientation were selected to be representative of a person breathing in when flushing the toilet/urinal
after use, since different choices were observed have a notable
impact on the measured droplet count. The probe inlet was positioned 5cm inside the rim of the toilet, and it was placed 5cm
outside the edge of the urinal, as depicted in Figure 1. In addition to measurements taken during normal operation of the
toilet, aerosol measurements were recorded after a large flat
plate was placed over the toilet opening, to assess the impact
of flushing with the lid closed. The use of a separate cover was
necessary since public restrooms in the United States often do
not come equipped with toilet seat lids.
The particle counter drew air samples at a volume flow
rate of 2.83 liters per minute (0.1 Cubic Feet per Minute
- CFM), and measured aerosol concentrations in six different size ranges, namely, (0.3 to 0.5)µm, (0.5 to 1.0)µm,
(1.0 to 3.0)µm, (3.0 to 5.0)µm, (5.0 to 10.0)µm, and (10.0
to 25.0)µm. For the tests reported here, air samples were
recorded at a sampling frequency of 1Hz for a total of 300

seconds at each of the levels depicted in Figure 1. We note
that although it is feasible to compute droplet concentration
at a given measurement location, it is difficult to determine
overall characteristic droplet production rates for the toilet or
urinal, since the measured values depend on both the location
and orientation of the probe. During the 300-second sampling,
the toilet and urinal were flushed manually 5 different times at
the 30, 90, 150, 210, and 270 second mark, with the flushing
handle held down for five consecutive seconds. The data obtained from the three different scenarios, i.e., toilet flushing,
covered toilet flushing, and urinal flushing, were analyzed to
determine the increase in aerosol concentration. The behavior of droplets of different sizes, the heights that they rose to,
and the impact of covering the toilet are discussed in detail in
Section III.

III.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The measurements from the particle counter were analyzed to determine the extent of aerosolization, and the various heights to which the droplets rise after flushing. Figure 2 shows the time-variation of the total number of particles
recorded by the sensor from measurements for the uncovered
toilet. The data plotted has been smoothed using a moving
average window of size 4 to reduce noise levels. Figure 2a
depicts the time series for particles of size (0.3 to 0.5)µm and
(0.5 to 1)µm, whereas the size groups (1 to 3)µm and (3 to

particles in various size ranges: (a) (0.3 to 0.5)µm - black, and (0.5 to 1)µm - blue; (b) (1 to 3)µm - black, and (3 to 5)µm blue; (c) (5 to 10)µm - black, and (10 to 25)µm - blue. The black curves in (a) and (b) correspond to the left vertical axes,
whereas the blue curves correspond to the right vertical axes. The dashed gray lines indicate the instances when the flushing
handle was depressed and held down for 5 seconds.

5)µm are shown in Figure 2b, and size groups (5 to 10)µm
and (10 to 25)µm are shown in Figure 2c. We observe a noticeable increase in particle count for all of the size ranges a
few seconds after flushing. This indicates that flushing the
toilet generates droplets in significant numbers, which can be
detected at seat-level for up to 30 seconds after initiating the
flush.
In Figure 2a we observe a large variation in the measured
levels of the smallest particles, i.e., those smaller than 1µm.
These particles are highly susceptible to flow disturbances in
the ambient environment due to their low mass, which may
account for the high variability. The time series for particles
larger than 1µm (Figures 2b and 2c) exhibit distinctive surges
in particle count after each flushing event. Importantly, the
total number of droplets generated in the smaller size ranges
is considerably larger than that generated in the larger ranges,
even though the surges appear to be less prominent for the

smaller droplets. We note that for the smallest aerosols (i.e.,
those smaller than 1µm), ambient levels in the restroom were
relatively high prior to starting the experiment (∼ O(3000)).
Thus, in these size ranges the flush-generated droplets comprise a small fraction of the total particle count. On the other
hand, ambient levels for particle sizes larger than 1µm were
negligible in the restroom (∼ O(1) to O(10)), resulting in the
distinctive surges observed after flushing.
Similar plots depicting the time-variation of droplet counts
for the covered toilet test and the urinal-flushing test are
shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively. For the covered
toilet, the plots display a large variation in the number of the
smallest droplets in Figure 3a, and comparatively small surges
relative to ambient levels due to the background count being
high. Importantly, the observed peak values of the surges are
lower for the covered toilet compared to the uncovered tests.
This is evident in Figure 3b, where the peak values are ap-

height of 0.43m (1 f t5in). The time series plots are shown for particles in various size ranges: (a) (0.3 to 0.5)µm - black, and
(0.5 to 1)µm - blue; (b) (1 to 3)µm - black, and (3 to 5)µm - blue; (c) (5 to 10)µm - black, and (10 to 25)µm - blue. The black

proximately 35 droplets on average for the (1 to 3)µm range,
and 3 droplets for the (3 to 5)µm range. The same numbers
for the uncovered toilet are approximately 50 droplets and 5
droplets, respectively, in Figure 2b. Notably, there is a significant reduction in the number of droplets larger than 5µm
for the covered toilet (Figure 3c) compared to the uncovered
toilet (Figure 2c). This indicates that the covering helps to
reduce the dispersion of flush-generated droplets, especially
those larger than 5µm, but it does not completely contain the
escape of droplets smaller than 5µm.
The data from the urinal-flushing tests in Figure 4 indicate a
large number of droplets generated in all size ranges observed;
the post-flush surges are much more pronounced than those
for the toilet-flushing tests, even for droplets smaller than 1µm
(Figure 4a). This may be related to the closer proximity of the
sensor to the water drain in the urinal, compared to the toiletflushing tests for which the sensor was placed at the outer edge

of the toilet bowl. We observe that there is no consistent increasing or decreasing trend in either the peaks or the baseline
levels with subsequent flushes in the time series plots. The
same holds true for data from the toilet-flushing tests in Figures 2 and 3. Thus, any short term changes in temperature
and RH at the measurement location due to flushing do not
have a noticeable impact on the droplet count. Furthermore,
while the smallest droplets will remain suspended for longer
than 300s, the time series plots indicate that droplet counts
at the sensor location return to ambient levels within approximately half a minute. Nonetheless, as these droplets move
past the particle counter they become part of the ambient environment, leading to a measurable increase in background
levels as demonstrated later in this section.
To compare the increase in droplet concentration for the
three different scenarios at various measurement heights, the
time series data were examined manually to identify the time

delay between flush initiation and the observed rise in particle count, as well as the total time span for which the particle
counts remained elevated. The corresponding values are provided in Table I. We note that the time delay between flush
initiation and the measured surge for the uncovered toilet at
seat-level was 10 seconds, whereas that for the covered toilet
was 0 seconds. Furthermore, the delay was smaller for the
covered toilet at a height of 1.22m (5s versus 10s), suggesting
that the aerosols were forced through gaps in between the seat
and the plate for the covered toilet. In both cases, the droplet
counts remained elevated for a further 20 seconds after first
detection of the surge. For the covered toilet and the urinal,
we observe a consistent increase in time delay with increasing
height, which also corresponds to increasing distance from the
flushing water, but the observed delay remained nearly constant for the uncovered toilet at 10s. We remark that the time
delay and detection duration are expected to be influenced

strongly by the placement of the sensor, the fixture geometry, the flushing mechanism, as well as the water volume and
pressure.
The number of droplets produced during the flushes were
determined by numerically integrating the sections comprising the ‘surge’ segments in the unfiltered time series. More
specifically, within each 1-minute window associated with a
particular flush, the start of the surge was identified using the
time-delay values specified in Table I. Starting at this time the
area under the particle-count curve was computed numerically
up until the end of the surge, the corresponding time span for
which is also specified in Table I. The average surge count was
determined by dividing this area by the corresponding time
span. The area under the remaining parts of the curve, i.e., the
segments lying outside the surge but within the 1-minute time
window, was determined similarly to obtain the average ambient droplet count. This ambient count was subtracted from

the surge count to yield the average number of flush-generated
droplets measured per second by the particle counter. The resulting values from the 4 different full-minute flush measurements were averaged to obtain the increase in droplet count
per second, and the standard deviation was computed to determine the uncertainty. The resulting data for the flushing toilet
is depicted graphically in Figure 5, and the corresponding numerical values are provided in Table II. We note that droplets
larger than 3µm were excluded from this analysis since very
few droplets in these size ranges were detected at the higher
locations, which made it difficult to distinguish between the
measured values and background noise.
The bar graphs in Figure 5 indicate that a significant number of droplets smaller than 0.5µm were generated by the
flushing toilet. If these droplets contain infectious microorganisms from aerosolized biomatter, they can pose a significant transmission risk since they remain suspended for long
periods of time. For instance, in a poorly ventilated location where gravitational settling is the only means of removing suspended particles, the Stokes settling time for a spherical water droplet of size 0.5µm from a height of 1.52m (5 f t)
would be approximately 56 hours, or more than 2 days. Apart
from the smallest aerosols, comparatively larger aerosols also
pose a risk in poorly ventilated areas even though they experience stronger gravitational settling. They often undergo rapid
evaporation in the ambient environment and the resulting decreases in size and mass, or the eventual formation of droplet
nuclei, can allow microbes to remain suspended for several
hours52–54 .
In Figure 5, we observe a large variation for aerosols in the
size range (0.3 to 0.5)µm. This may be attributed to the small
droplets’ high sensitivity to ambient flow fluctuations, as well
as to the sensor’s limited counting efficiency in this range. Notably, droplets smaller than 3µm are detectable in significant
numbers even at a height of 1.52m (5 f t). We observe a consistent decline in droplet count with increasing height; there
is a significant drop in droplet count going from seat-level to
1.22m, and a very small decrease with a further move up to
1.52m for droplets larger than 0.5µm. The smallest aerosols
exhibit some variation in the trend, which is likely due to the
sensor limitations mentioned above. The observed decrease in
droplet count with increasing measurement height is expected,

the standard deviation of the measured increase from
multiple flushes. Each bar cluster corresponds to particles in
a given size range, and indicates how the droplet count varies
with measurement height. The corresponding values are

since the droplet concentration is highest when the probe is
placed closer to the flushing water, and it decreases at farther
locations due to dispersal of the droplets over a wider area.
We remark that gravitational forces are not expected to play a
dominant role in the observed behavior, given the extremely
small mass of the aerosols being considered here. Rather, it is
aerodynamic drag that dominates. The Stokes settling speed
for the largest aerosol being considered, i.e., a 3µm droplet, is
approximately 0.00027m/s. This amounts to a settling time of
1589s from a height of 0.43m, and even longer for the smaller
droplets. Thus, the effects of gravitational forces are not dominant at the time scales being considered (∼ O(10s)). Finally,
the monotonic decrease in particle count with increasing particle size is similar to the trend observed by Johnson et al.5 for
various toilet designs and flushing mechanisms.
The data collected after flushing the covered toilet and the
urinal were also processed in a similar manner to determine
the corresponding increases in droplet count per second. The
results for the covered toilet are presented in Figure 6 and Table III, whereas those from flushing the urinal are presented in
Figure 7 and Table IV. Results from measurements at 1.52m
height were not included in the analysis for the covered toi-

let, since it was difficult to discern droplet counts from background noise due to the extremely low measured values. This
indicates that the covering plate prevented the aerosols from
rising upward and instead deflected them to lower levels, also
resulting in shorter time delays compared to the uncovered toilet (Table I). Over the long term however, these aerosols could
rise up with updrafts created by the ventilation system or by
the movement of people in the restroom.
We observe a large number of aerosolized droplets smaller
than 1µm in Figure 6, and an appreciable number of droplets
in the (1 to 3)µm range. This suggests that while the covering
is able to suppress the dispersion of droplets to some extent,
it does not eliminate them completely. Thus, although a toilet
lid may appear to be a straightforward solution for reducing
aerosol dispersal, other alternatives may need to be evaluated
when designing public restrooms, such as modifying the fixture design, water pressure, vent placement, airflow rate, or
even employing a liquid ‘curtain’ incorporated into the fixture55 .
The bars in Figure 6 display a consistent decline in droplet
count with increasing height, similar to the trend observed for
the uncovered toilet. One unexpected observation is the occurrence of higher droplet counts for the covered toilet at 1.22m,
compared to analogous measurements for the uncovered toilet in Table II. We remark that this does not indicate that the
covering led to an increase in droplet count, but rather that the
aerosols were redirected in higher concentrations to the position where the counter was located, after being forced through
gaps between the seat and the cover. Examining the data from
the the urinal-flushing tests in Figure 7, we observe a similar decline in droplet count with increasing height as for the
other two cases. A large number of droplets were detected in
the (0.3 to 0.5)µm size range (approximately 300 droplets per
second on average) at the lowest measurement level, which
can be attributed to the close proximity of the sensor to the
flushing water. Moreover, a significant number of droplets
reached heights of up to 1.22m (4 f t) from the ground, similar
to the toilet-flushing tests.
We remark that the total number of droplets generated in
each flushing test described here can range in the tens of thousands. The numbers reported here indicate average droplet
count per second, for cases where the time span for each surge
varies from 15s to 20s (Table I). Thus, an average count of 50
droplets per second for one size range would amount to a total
of 750 to 1000 droplets at one particular measurement location. Considering that similar measurements could be made
all around the periphery of the fixtures, and that droplets are
generated in several different size ranges, the overall total
count would likely end up being significantly higher. Furthermore, droplet generation and accumulation depend on a variety of factors, such as the design of the toilet fixtures, the water pressure, the ventilation positioning, airflow, temperature,
and RH, to name a few. The aim of the present work is not
to present detailed characterizations of the influence of these
factors on droplet dynamics, but instead to highlight the occurrence of aerosol generation and accumulation within public restrooms. These observations can help stimulate further
studies to investigate steps to mitigate the issues involved. We

further note that while the results presented here are restricted
to specific measurement heights, there is a high likelihood of
the aerosols getting dispersed throughout the room over time
due to updrafts created by the ventilation system or by the
movement of people.
In addition to the flush-generated aerosol measurements,
ambient aerosol levels were measured prior to starting the
experiments and again after completing all of the tests. After approximately 3 hours of tests involving over 100 flushes,
there was a substantial increase in the measured aerosol levels in the ambient environment. The corresponding data is
presented in Figure 8 and Table V. There was a 69.5% increase in measured levels for particles of size (0.3 to 0.5)µm,
a 209% increase for the (0.5 to 1)µm particles, and a 50%
increase for the (1 to 3)µm particles. Particles larger than
3µm were excluded from the analysis due to the the impact of background noise on the extremely low measured values. The results point to significant accumulation of flushgenerated aerosolized droplets within the restroom over time,
which indicates that the ventilation system was not effective
in removing them from the enclosed space, although there was
no perceptible lack of airflow within the restroom; the room

7.5m3 /min (265 CFM) and 5.66m3 /min (200 CFM). Furthermore, a comparison with ambient levels outside the restroom
(a few meters away from the closed restroom door, but within
the same building) indicated that the levels of droplets smaller
than 1µm were more than 10 times higher within the restroom
compared to ambient levels outside the restroom. This was
unexpected since the restroom had been closed off for more
than 24 hours after deep cleaning, with the ventilation system
operating normally. While it is difficult to ascertain the exact source of the droplets that contributed to high background
levels within the restroom, it is likely that they were generated
during the cleaning operation. There were no other readily
apparent sources, since both locations, i.e., inside and outside
the restroom, employed the same centralized air-conditioning
system, and the RH and temperature were maintained at comparable levels (Figure 9). These observations further highlight
the importance of employing adequate ventilation in enclosed
spaces to extract suspended droplets effectively, in order to
reduce the chances of infection transmission via aerosolized
droplets.

hood of infection for respiratory illnesses via bioaerosols may
be low compared to the risk posed by respiratory droplets
(since virions are detected in larger quantities in respiratory
samples), it presents a viable transmission route especially
in public restrooms which often experience heavy foot-traffic
within a relatively confined area. As demonstrated here, multiple flush-use over time can lead to an accumulation of potentially infectious aerosols, which poses a measurable risk considering the large number of individuals who may visit a public restroom and subsequently disperse into the broader community. Moreover, apart from flush-generated bioaerosols, the
accumulation of respiratory aerosols also poses a concern in
public restrooms if adequate ventilation is not available. Overall, the results presented here highlight the crucial need for
ensuring effective aerosol removal capability in high density
and frequently visited public spaces.

tious aerosols within public restrooms, which poses an elevated risk of airborne disease transmission. In addition to
flush-generated bioaerosols, the accumulation of respiratory
aerosols also poses a concern in public restrooms in the absence of adequate ventilation. Overall, the results presented
here indicate that ensuring adequate ventilation in public restrooms is essential, since these relatively confined areas often experience heavy foot traffic and could pose a risk for
widespread community transmission of various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses.

CONCLUSION

The aerosolization of biomatter from flushing toilets is
known to play a potential role in spreading a wide variety of
gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses. To better understand
the risk of infection transmission that such droplets may pose
in confined spaces, this paper investigates droplet-generation
by flushing toilets and urinals in a public restroom operating
under normal ventilation condition. The measurements were
conducted inside a medium-sized public restroom, with a particle counter placed at various heights to determine the size
and number of droplets generated upon flushing. The results
indicate that both toilets and urinals generate large quantities
of droplets smaller than 3µm in size, which can pose a significant transmission risk if they contain infectious microorganisms from aerosolized biomatter. The droplets were detected
at heights of up to 1.52m (5 f t) for 20 seconds or longer after
initiating the flush. Owing to their small size, these droplets
can remain suspended for long periods of time, as is demonstrated in the present study via ambient measurements taken
before and after conducting the experiments. When a large
flat plate was used to cover the toilet opening, it led to a decrease in droplet dispersion but not a complete absence of the
measured aerosols. This indicates that installing toilet seat
lids in public restrooms may help reduce droplet dispersal to
some extent, but it may not sufficiently address the risk posed
by the smallest aerosolized droplets. Ambient aerosol levels
measured before and after conducting the experiments indicated a substantial increase in particle count, pointing to significant accumulation of flush-generated aerosols within the
restroom over time. This indicates that the ventilation system was not effective in removing the aerosols, although there
was no perceptible lack of airflow within the restroom. Importantly, this suggests that multiple flush-use over time can
lead to the accumulation of high levels of potentially infec-
