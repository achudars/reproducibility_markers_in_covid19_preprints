Abstract
In Australia and beyond, journalism is reportedly an industry in crisis, a crisis exacerbated by COVID-19. However,
the evidence revealing the crisis is often anecdotal or limited in scope. In this unprecedented longitudinal research,
we draw on data from the Australian journalism jobs market from January 2012 until March 2020. Using Data Science
and Machine Learning techniques, we analyse two distinct data sets: job advertisements (ads) data comprising 3,698
journalist job ads from a corpus of over 6.7 million Australian job ads; and official employment data from the Australian
Bureau of Statistics. Having matched and analysed both sources, we address both the demand for and supply of
journalists in Australia over this critical period. The data show that the crisis is real, but there are also surprises.
Counter-intuitively, the number of journalism job ads in Australia rose from 2012 until 2016, before falling into decline.
Less surprisingly, for the entire period studied the figures reveal extreme volatility, characterised by large and erratic
fluctuations. The data also clearly show that COVID-19 has significantly worsened the crisis. We can also tease
out more granular findings, including: that there are now more women than men journalists in Australia, but that
gender inequity is worsening, with women journalists getting younger and worse-paid just as men journalists are,
on average, getting older and better-paid; that, despite the crisis besetting the industry, the demand for journalism
skills has increased; and that the skills sought by journalism job ads increasingly include social media and generalist
communications.

Introduction
In Australia, the news about the news is not good.
In early March 2020, newswire service the Australian
Associated Press announced it would be shutting down its
operations after 85 years. ‘Investors look to salvage parts
of AAP as newswire faces closure’, reported the Sydney
Morning Herald on March 2 (Samios 2020). The Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) predicted that 500 people
would lose their jobs as a result (Khadem and Pupazzoni
2020). In the US, the news about the news is just as bad,
if not worse. ‘On a rough day for American newspapers,
investors arent buying Gannetts story and Tribunes not done
chopping’ was the headline on a Nieman journalism Lab
story published on February 27 (Benton 2020). According
to the report, layoffs looked likely at the countrys No. 1
and No. 3 newspaper chains, while the countrys No. 2 chain
(McClatchy) had already declared bankruptcy a fortnight
earlier. As the Nieman Lab notes:
The Internet has brought forth an unprecedented flowering of news and information. But
it has also destabilized the old business models that have supported quality journalism for
decades. Good journalists across the country are
losing their jobs or adjusting to a radically new
news environment online (Nieman-Lab 2020).

Is journalism in crisis? A wealth of research in Australia,
the US and comparable countries suggests yes. Profits
are hard, if not impossible, to come by; many firms are
struggling or collapsing; and layoffs and redundancies are
the norm. As Fenton (2011) wrote in a paper centred on
the UK, ‘News media are in crisis. The crisis is being
managed by closing papers or shedding staff [and] these
cuts are having a devastating effect on the quality of the
news.’ That was nearly a decade ago. Since then, the situation
has only worsened. In Australia, the commonly cited figure
based on research by the journalists union is that 3,000
journalism positions have been lost since 2011 (Ricketson
et al. 2020). For instance, it is estimated that in 2011 news
publisher Fairfax Media employed about 1,000 editorial staff
across the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The Australian
Financial Review, and its Sunday papers, The Sun Herald
and The Sunday Age. By mid-2017, however, half of those
jobs were gone (Zion et al. 2018), including the job of one

of this papers authors. And then the coronavirus wielded its
scythe. As we discuss below, the impact of COVID-19 on
journalism jobs is proving devastating, with widespread job
losses, particularly in regional areas (Crerar 2020).
This research aims to assess the extent of the claimed
‘journalism crisis’ in Australia by analysing labour market
data from 2012 to 2020. Our findings confirm that there
is a crisis in journalism; a crisis that is now in full bloom
due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the data also
yields more granular findings, including several surprises.
One finding is that advertised journalism jobs only started
to decline from 2016, not before. A second is that as
the journalism jobs market becomes more volatile, gender
inequity is worsening: women journalists who remain are
younger and worse paid than the men who remain. And a
third is that according to our skill similarity calculations,
generalist ‘Communications’, ‘Public Relations’, and ‘Social
Media’ are skills that are becoming more important to
journalism, as opposed to traditionally specialist journalism
skills such as ‘Reporting’, ‘Editing’, and ‘Investigative
Journalism’. These findings, together with others, reveal that
the crisis in journalism is not only real, but in some ways
more concerning than was previously understood.
To fulfil this research aim, we analyse a range of
longitudinal data sources from job advertisements (ads)
and official Australian employment statistics. The breadth
and detail of these data provide us with the opportunity
to comprehensively assess the journalism jobs market in
Australia and how it has changed. We apply Data Science and
Machine Learning techniques to analyse how the underlying
skills of journalists in Australia have evolved. This allows us
to build a data-driven methodology to determine which are
the top journalism skills per year and identify the occupations
in possession of these skills. Finally, we use these skill-level
results to determine where people with journalism skills are
likely finding alternative career paths.
The main contributions of this research include:
• providing a comprehensive and longitudinal assessment of journalism jobs in Australia from 2012 to
2020 by analysing both job ads data and occupational
employment statistics;
• implementing a data-driven methodology to explore
the nature of the oft-cited ’crisis’ in journalism jobs
in Australia,;
• applying this data-driven methodology to tease out
more granular and specific trends in journalism
jobs, including the impact of the current coronavirus
pandemic, the contrasting impacts on regional and
urban journalism jobs, and the gendered nature of
ongoing impacts; and
• analysing the data to identify the skills sought in
journalism jobs, and where people with journalism
skills are likely finding alternate career paths.

Related Work & Background
Journalism jobs in crisis. If there is a crisis, the simple
explanation is the Internet. (Putting aside COVID-19, to
which we will return.) While digital channels have given
Prepared using sagej.cls

journalism bigger audiences, they have also strangled
income. Once, advertising funded journalism, but now
advertising has largely migrated online. As the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) found in
2019, in the Final Report of its Digital Platforms Inquiry,
‘The reduction in advertising revenue over the past 20 years,
for reasons including the rise of online advertising, appears
to have reduced the ability of some media businesses to
fund Australian news and journalism’. The ACCC cited
Census data showing that ‘from 2006 to 2016, the number
of Australians in journalism-related occupations fell by
9% overall, and by 26% for traditional print journalists
(including those journalists working for print/online news
media businesses)’. Further, the ACCC cited data provided
by leading media companies showing that the number of
journalists in traditional print media businesses fell by
20% from 2014 to 2018 a time of growth for Australia’s
population and economy (ACCC 2019).
However, the pressures on news media are not spread
evenly. For instance, local news is bearing a particular
brunt. Between 2008 and 2018, 106 local and regional
newspaper titles closed across Australia, representing a 15%
decrease in the number of such publications. As a result, 21
local government areas previously served by a newspaper
were now without coverage, including 16 local government
areas in regional Australia (ACCC 2019). These figures are
mirrored in the US. In 2018, Abernathy (2018) from the
Hussman School of Journalism and Media at UNC released
a report, ‘The Expanding News Desert’, which found that
the US had lost almost 1800 papers since 2004, with 7112
remaining (1283 dailies and 5829 weeklies). This means that
the US lost roughly 20% of its newspapers between 2004
and 2018. These closures included large dailies such as the
Tampa Tribune and the Rocky Mountain News, but also many
newspapers that had circulations of fewer than 5000 and
served small, impoverished communities.
The big picture reveals that, in an era of misinformation,
social media and news aggregators, news media companies
are under pressure, and journalism jobs are being cut. There
is some hope in the shape of new players entering the
market and hiring journalists, including in the shape of
digital natives such as Vice and Buzzfeed. However, in 2019
these two companies were among the many that announced
significant staff layoffs (Goggin 2019). What’s more, as
Australia’s ACCC notes, these publications ‘tend to employ
relatively few journalists’ (ACCC 2019). Even accounting
for new arrivals, the number of journalism jobs in Australia
is falling (see Jobs Data Analysis and Results), and as a
result there are areas (including local government, local
court, health and science issues) that journalism is no longer
covering adequately (ACCC 2019).
Further research is also revealing a clearer profile of
the typical journalist, and also the typical journalist who
loses his/her job. Drawing on 2017 data, one study found
that journalism jobs internationally are largely filled by
a young, inexperienced and itinerant workforce (Josephi
and Oller Alonso 2018). Meanwhile, research suggests
that it is journalists with extensive experience who are
losing their jobs (at least in Australia) (Sherwood and
O’Donnell 2018). And those who lose their jobs face
decidedly uncertain futures. In longitudinal research tracking

Dawson et al.

the post-journalism careers of Australian journalists who
had been made redundant, many of those surveyed revealed
they were experiencing job precarity. Further, a significant
minority had moved into strategic communications or public
relations (Zion et al. 2018).
The impacts of COVID-19. The advertising crisis for
journalism has been described not as a single black swan, but
as a flock of black swans (Doctor 2020). According to one
estimate, from 2006 to 2020, US newspapers lost more than
70 percent of their ad dollars (Doctor 2020). And then came
COVID-19. Just as the coronavirus has been claiming lives,
it has also been claiming journalism jobs, with particularly
devastating impacts on regional and local news outlets.
This is true in many countries, including the US. In March,
layoffs were announced at the Detroit Metro Times and
its six sibling mastheads, with remaining staff told their
pay would be cut (Flynn 2020). With concerts cancelled
and restaurants shuttered, promoters and restaurateurs had
nothing to advertise. On March 25, 2020, The Atlantic ran
a story under the headline, ’The coronavirus is killing local
news’ (Waldman and Sennott 2020). The story called for
government and philanthropic intervention, and for people
to subscribe: ‘Among the important steps you should take
during this crisis: Wash your hands. Don’t touch your face.
And buy a subscription to your local newspaper.’ In a
matter of weeks, many American news websites’ advertising
revenues are said to have fallen by as much as 50%. As one
media expert noted in late March, ’Advertising, which has
been doing a slow disappearing act since 2008, has been
cut in half in the space of two weeks’ (Doctor 2020). Flynn
(2020) reported in March, ‘At least 100 people have lost their
jobs in media over the past two weeks, with most outlets
citing coronavirus as the direct cause.’
In the UK in April, The Guardian reported that
newspapers were set to lose 57million if the outbreak lasted
for another three months (Sweney 2020). This was partly
because advertisers were refusing to place their ads next
to stories about the pandemic, which they deemed to be
inappropriate content.
In Australia too, as we have seen, there were widespread
closures and job losses before coronavirus, but COVID-19
compounded the problem. In late March, Rupert Murdoch’s
publishing business News Corp warned of ’inevitable’ job
cuts and the closure of regional titles (Meade 2020b). Soon
afterwards, News Corp Australia’s biggest publisher suspended the print editions of 60 Australian newspapers,
including the Manly Daily and Wentworth Courier in
Sydney, the Brisbane News and the Mornington Peninsula
Leader in Victoria (Meade 2020b). The cuts came in
the wake of a dramatic drop in advertising from the
entertainment, restaurant and real industries, the titles’ main
revenue sources.
In many countries, governments have announced assistance packages. On April 6, the Australian government
announced it would bring forward the release of $5million from its Regional and Small Publishers Innovation
Fund to support public interest journalism during COVID19 (Fletcher 2020). In April 2020, the Danish government
allocated approximately 24m to save local media. ‘The
scheme can compensate for the lost advertising revenue,’ said
culture minister Joy Mogensen (Zalan 2020).

By contrast, however, some governments are making the
coverage of coronavirus harder. In China, authorities have
cracked down on doctors and reporters who exposed the
outbreak (Kuo 2020); in the US, journalists are being barred
from talking to staff at public hospitals (Carville et al.
2020); and in countries including Venezuela, Niger and
India, journalists have been arrested and intimidated (CPJ
2020).
Job ads as a proxy for labour demand. Job ads provide
‘leading’ indicators of shifting labour demands as they occur,
as opposed to the ‘lagging’ indicators from labour market
surveys. Consequently, job ads are increasingly used as a
data source for analysing labour market dynamics (Markow
et al. 2017; Blake 2019). For instance, job ads data have
also been used to assess labour shortages. Dawson et al.
(2019) defined a range of indicators to evaluate the presence
and extent of shortages, such as posting frequency, salary
levels, educational requirements, and experience demands.
They also built a metric based on the forecasting error
from Machine Learning models trained to predict posting
frequency. Intuitively, occupations experiencing high posting
volatility are difficult to predict. Subsequent work showed
these indicators to be predictive of labour shortages in the
Australian Labour Market (Dawson et al. 2020). In the
present research, in Jobs Data Analysis and Results, we
use a similar set of indicators to analyse labour demand for
journalists. Further details on job ads data are provided in the
Supplemental Material.
Analysing journalism jobs with job ads. Journalism
jobs have also previously been analysed using job ads.
Young and Carson (2018) collected and assessed how
Australian media outlets defined journalism job positions
when hiring journalists from November 2009 to November
2010. The authors used a content analysis methodology and
manually labelled data fields, such as employer, educational
qualifications, job responsibilities, experience requirements,
location, work hours, media platform, skill demands, job
title, and any other miscellaneous information. The authors
found that journalism was not a high priority during this
period; instead employers advertised four times as many job
ads for sales, marketing, and advertising positions.
More recently, Guo and Volz (2019) conducted content
analysis on 669 journalist job announcements from US
media organisations, as posted on Indeed.com from 1
July to 31 December 2017. The authors’ objective was
to define, compare, and analyse the journalists’ expertise
requirements as expressed through job ads. To achieve this
objective, the authors manually reviewed and codified job
vacancies. This research found that ‘multi-skilled’ journalists
are experiencing higher levels of demand. The authors also
found that journalists’ ability to flexibly adapt to changing
situations was a characteristic of growing importance. These
studies, while significant, are relatively limited in scope. In
this paper, we analyse a nine-year long dataset which allows
us to uncover longitudinal dynamics of journalism jobs.
Limitations of job ads data. Job ads data are
an incomplete representation of labour demand. Some
employers use traditional forms of advertising for vacancies,
such as newspaper classifieds, their own hiring platforms,
or recruitment agency procurement. Furthermore, anecdotal
evidence reveals that some vacancies are filled informally,

4

using channels such as word of mouth, professional
networks and social media. Job ads data also overrepresent occupations with higher-skill requirements and
higher wages, colloquially referred to as ‘white collar’
jobs (Carnevale et al. 2014). Finally, just because a job is
advertised, does not mean that the position will be, or has
been, filled.
Employment statistics and occupational standards.
Employment statistics provide data on populations employed
in standardised occupational classes. Occupations in Australia correspond to their respective occupational classes
according to the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) (Australian Bureau of
Statistics 2013).
There are significant shortcomings to analysing occupations within ANZSCO categories. Official occupational
taxonomies (like ANZSCO) are often static and are rarely
updated, therefore failing to capture emerging skills, which
can misrepresent the true labour dynamics of particular jobs.
For example, the occupational class of ‘Print Journalist’ has
been a constant in Australian occupational statistics. Yet,
the underlying skills of a ‘Print Journalist’ have changed
dramatically in recent decades.
To overcome the above-stated limitations, in our data
construction, we leverage the BGT occupational ontology
together with the ANZSCO ontology. We also use the rich
skill-level information from job ads that are missing from
occupational employment statistics to build an encompassing
journalism job ads dataset.

Data & Methods
Data Sources
This research uses both labour demand and labour supply
data to analyse journalism jobs. On the labour demand
side, we use a detailed dataset of over 6.7 million
Australian job ads, spanning from January 2012 to March
2020. These data were generously provided by Burning
Glass Technologies* (BGT). For labour supply data, we
leverage official employment statistics (Australian Bureau
of Statistics 2019a) and salary levels (Australian Bureau
of Statistics 2019b) provided by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) over the same period. These data sources
provide longitudinal employment and salary information
that have been disaggregated by gender, location, and types
of employment (full-time and part-time). Further details
of data sources and data construction are provided in the
Supplemental Material.

Journal Title XX(X)

whereas ‘Journalism’ and ‘Oncology’ have a low similarity
because they are generally seldom used jointly. We measure
the similarity of skill-pairs based on their co-occurrence
patterns in job ads, while accounting for skill ubiquity
and specialisation. To capture how journalism skills have
changed over time, we measure skill similarity during
calendar years.
Formally, given J as the set of job ads posted during a
specific calendar year, we measure the similarity between
two skills s and s0 as:
P

e(j, s)e(j, s0 )

j 0 ∈J

θ(s, s0 ) =

!
max

P

e(j, s),

j 0 ∈J

P

(1)

e(j, s0 )

j 0 ∈J

where j and j 0 are individuals jobs ads from the set J, and
e(s, j) ∈ {0, 1} measures the importance of skills s for job j
using theory from Trade Economics (Hidalgo et al. 2007).
Skills s and s0 are considered as highly complementary
if they commonly co-occur and are both ‘important’ for
the same job ads. Finally, θ(s, s0 ) ∈ [0, 1], a larger value
indicates that s and s0 are more similar, and it reaches the
maximum value when s and s0 always co-occur (i.e. they
never appear separately).
We build the top yearly lists of journalism skills by
computing θ(Journalism, s) – i.e. the similarity between
the skill ‘Journalism’ and each unique skill that occurs
for each year from 2014-2018. The yearly top 50 most
similar skills to ‘Journalism’ are shown in the Supplemental
Material together with the full details of the θ measure.
Journalism skill intensity. Finally, we determine the
occupations that most require the top journalism skills
uncovered from the above. We propose η, the ‘Journalism
Skill Intensity’, for each standardised BGT occupation,
defined as percentage of journalism skills relative to the
total skill count for the job ads related to an occupation o.
Formally:
P
x(j, s)
j∈O,s∈D
P
η(o, D) =
(2)
x(j, s0 )
j∈O,s0 ∈S

where D is the set of journalism skills, and O is the set of
job ads associated with the occupation o. This method allows
us to adaptively select occupations based on their journalism
skill intensity.

Skill Similarity
To analyse the underlying journalism skills within occupations, we implement a skill similarity methodology adapted
from Alabdulkareem et al. (2018) and then by Dawson et al.
(2019) to calculate the pairwise similarities between skills
from job ads.
Skill similarity. Two skills are similar when the two
are related and complementary, i.e. the two skills in a
skills-pair support each other. For example, ‘Journalism’
and ‘Editing’ have a high pairwise similarity score because
together they enable higher productivity for a journalist;

Jobs Data Analysis and Results
In this section, we perform a data-driven analysis of
journalism jobs in Australia based on job ads data and official
occupational statistics. First, we longitudinally examine key
features of jobs data, such as employment levels, job ads
posting frequency, salaries, and posting frequency growth
and predictability level. We also analyse how the underlying
skills of journalists have changed over time, and which skills
and occupations are growing in similarity to journalism.

(see Sec. Data & Methods) and employment levels of
‘Journalists & Other Writers’ at the ANZSCO Unit level (000’s)
from Jan 2012 to Dec 2019.

Posting Frequency & Employment levels
In Australian journalism, 2012 is considered a watershed
year. An estimated 1,500 journalists were made redundant,
the majority of those from Australia’s two largest print
companies, Fairfax Media (now Nine Entertainment) and
News Limited (now News Corp Australia) (Zion et al.
2016). The severity of this industrial shock can be observed
in Fig. 1. Against the left y-axis, the blue line shows
quarterly job ads posting frequency for journalism jobs. As
the graph depicts, posting frequency for journalism job ads
experienced extremely low levels in 2012 until 2013, when
they began to increase. The volume of vacancies increased
until mid-2014, before plummeting in late-2014 to the levels
last seen in 2012. From 2015, journalism job ads experienced
strong growth, reaching a peak in mid-2016. Since then,
journalism job ads have trended downward until the end of
2019, albeit with volatile peaks and troughs. In summary, the
data shows that journalism job ads have not been in freefall
since 2012. Rather, there was erratic growth in journalism
job ads until a peak in 2016, followed by erratic decline.
Similarly, employment levels underwent immense volatility from 2012 to 2013. Against the right y-axis of Fig. 1,
the orange line shows the number of quarterly employed
for ‘Journalists & Other Writers’ at the ANZSCO Unit
level. Employment levels peaked in mid 2012, before dramatically dropping in early 2013. This is an effect of the
the mass journalist redundancies made in 2012, given that
employment statistics are ‘lagging indicators’ and it takes
time for labour markets to reflect changes in occupational
statistics. Early 2013 marked the lowest point of journalist
employment seen in this time-series. As also observed in
job ads data, journalist employment levels grew until 20162017 and has since trended downwards, exhibiting volatile
quarterly changes through to the end of 2019.
COVID-19 and journalism jobs. The early effects of
COVID-19 are apparent in the posting frequency of job ads
in Australia. This is the case for most occupations, including
journalists. At the time of writing, official Australian
employment statistics were not yet available, making it
difficult to determine the extent of job losses caused by the
pandemic. However, job ads provide a leading indicator of
labour demand (Dawson et al. 2019). Higher vacancy rates
Prepared using sagej.cls

typically mean higher levels of labour demand by employers,
which is a critical component of healthy labour markets.
As Fig. 2 highlights, vacancy volumes have declined for
both journalism jobs and at aggregate levels in Australia.
Since mid-February, weekly posting frequency has decreased
across all Australia job ads, as seen in Fig. 2a. Such a
decline this early in the year is atypical. As Dawson and
Rizoiu (2020) show, the frequency of job ad postings follow a
yearly seasonal pattern, with late February and early March
typically being a period of upward trend growth. However,
late February and early March 2020 coincided with the
International outbreak of COVID-19. During this period, the
Australian government instituted widespread quarantine and
social distancing measures, which significantly constrained
economic activity (Boseley and Knaus 2020). The impacts
of these COVID-19 containment laws are starkly apparent
in Fig. 2b. Posting frequency for journalism jobs are down
63% when comparing March 2019 volumes to March 2020.
This is significantly higher than the aggregate market of all
Australian job ads, which is down 37% over the same period.
Fig. 2b shows that Melbourne appears to be the city hardest
hit, recording no journalism job ads in March 2020 and only
3 posts for the first quarter of 2020. Clearly the pandemic
is having a highly damaging effect on the journalism jobs
market.

Salaries
We compare salaries extracted from job ads with ABS
reported wage data for ‘Journalists and Other Writers’† .
Fig. 3 reveals two main findings regarding journalist
salaries. First, according to job ads data, journalists attract
considerably lower annual wage levels (solid blue line)
than the market average (dashed blue line). As of 2018,
job ads indicate that journalists earn approximately $10,000
less than the market average. These findings, however, are
somewhat contrary to the wage earnings data collected by
the ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2019b), according
to which ‘Journalists and Other Writers’ (solid orange line)
have been earning a growing wage premium over the market
average (dashed orange line) since 2014. This discrepancy
can be explained by the fact that job ads data tend to overrepresent occupations in the ‘Professional’ and ‘Manager’
classes (Carnevale et al. 2014), which typically attract higher
wages. As a result, the average salary levels from job ads
data (dashed blue line) are about $20,000 higher than average
salary levels from ABS data (dashed orange line), from 2014
to 2018. However, the salary levels for journalists are very
similar when comparing across the two data sources.
Fig. 3 yields a second observation: journalist salary levels
increased in both absolute and relative terms compared to
average market levels, between 2012 to 2018 in both data
sources. More importantly, the relative salary growth of
journalists has exceeded the market averages, during the
period studied.

Trend Analysis & Predictability
Posting trends. We constructed an auto-regressive Machine
Learning model to predict posting frequency of journalism
job ads in Australia (Dawson et al. 2019). The model
accounts for long term trends, seasonality patterns and
external events (see the Supplemental Material for technical
details). We isolated the posting frequency trend component
and, in Fig. 4, plotted it comparatively for ‘Journalists’
against two occupations experiencing high levels of labour
demand, ‘Data Scientists’ and ‘Data Analysts’, as well as
against the aggregated market trend. Visibly, journalism
jobs experienced varying degrees of growth until mid 2016,
at which point growth plateaued, and started to decline.
From the end of 2017 until the beginning of 2019, the
trend for journalism job ads has heavily decreased, even
when compared to the aggregate market, which also shows
a more modest decrease during the same period. ‘Data
Scientists’ and ‘Data Analysts’ have been consistently
growing throughout the the entire period.

Quantify labour demand volatility. When constructing
Machine Learning models, it is standard procedure to
use error metrics to evaluate the prediction accuracy.
Volatility in posting volumes inherently lead to lowered
prediction performance. Here we use the prediction error
measured using the ‘Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage
Error’ (Scott Armstrong 1985; Makridakis 1993) as a
proxy for the the volatility of labour demand for different
occupations (see the technical section in the Supplemental
Material for more details).

Location
Fig. 7 plots the location and volume of employed journalists
in Australia. Fig. 7a shows the absolute and relative number
of job ads posted for each of the capital cities, and
outside them, and Fig. 7b shows the location of employed
journalists per state. Unsurprisingly, Sydney and Melbourne,
the respective capital cities of New South Wales (NSW) and
Victoria (VIC), consistently have the highest job ad posting
frequencies. However, the relative share of job ad posting
frequency in Australian capital cities has shrunk in recent
years, with Fig. 7a showing an increase outside of major
cities, both in relative and absolute terms. This trend reached
a peak in 2017, when less than 50% of all journalist job
ads were for positions inside capital cities. A small rebound
followed, and in 2019 Sydney commanded approximately
one-third of all journalism job ads.

for the volume of ‘All Australian job postings’. We use a
sliding window approach to obtain multiple predictions (see
the Supplemental Material) that we aggregate as boxplots.
The higher the error score on the vertical axis, the lower
the predictive abilities for that occupation. As Fig. 5 reveals,
predicting the daily posting frequency of journalism jobs is
consistently more difficult than for the other occupations,
and the market as whole. ‘Data Scientists’, an occupation
undergoing strong relative growth, is also showing a high
prediction error compared to the market as a whole, indicative of experiencing a degree of volatility. However, it is
not nearly commensurate to the predictive difficulties, and
volatility, of journalists. This was true from 2012 to 2019,
and has become worse in 2020 with the spread of COVID19.

Education & Experience

Gender

Employment Type

There have been growing gender differences of employed
journalists in Australia since 2014. Fig. 6a shows that the
ratio of female employed journalists has increased relative
to male journalists (ANZSCO Unit Level) (Australian
Bureau of Statistics 2019a). In 2014, the female-to-male
employment ratio was 0.7. In 2018, the proportion more than
doubled, with almost 1.8 female journalists employed for
every male journalist. It has since declined in 2019 to 1.35,
but this proportion is still almost double that of 2014.
Fig. 6b also shows that wage inequality between female
and male journalists has worsened (Australian Bureau
of Statistics 2019b). Since 2014, the annual salaries for
female journalists increased by only AU$3,000, whereas
annual salaries for male journalists increased by more
than AU$30,000. Male journalists thus experienced an
average wage growth that was ten times greater than female
journalists from 2014 to 2018.
There are also changing age demographics of employed
journalists during the studied period. The markers on Fig. 6b
highlight the average age of journalists by gender, per
year. Male journalists have been getting older, their average
age increasing by two years from 2014 to 2018. Female
journalists, however, have been steadily getting younger. The
average age for female journalists decreased by more than
four years from 2014 to 2018.

Casual and temporary work have become more commonplace in Australia (Gilfillan 2018), and we study if this is
also the case for Australian journalism jobs. In Fig. 9 we plot
the number of permanent and temporary journalism jobs, per
calendar year. The number of ‘Temporary’ journalism jobs
has increased in absolute terms since 2012, and they have
made up the majority of all journalism ads in every year. It
is noteworthy too that the share of ‘Permanent’ journalism
vacancies has also increased since 2012. However, this trend
should be interpreted with a degree of scepticism as only
∼ 50% of all journalism job ads specify whether the roles
advertised are permanent or temporary.

Prepared using sagej.cls

Figs. 8a and 8b show respectively the number of years of
formal education required for journalists, and the experience
requirements (both per year, extracted from job ads data)
The education requirements consistently remained at market
average levels, with journalists required to possess a
Bachelor-level degree (approximately 16 years of education).
By contrast, the experience requirements have been more
variable. Since 2012, employers have required fewer years
of experience from journalists than is required in the market
generally. However, the gap is narrowing. In 2018, employers
demanded of journalists, on average, one additional year
of experience compared to 2014. This counters the general
market trend of employers demanding less experience of
prospective employees.

Journalism Skills
Growing demand for journalism skills. Here we perform
a detailed analysis of the top 50 journalism skills that we
identify for each year from 2014 to 2018 (see Data &
Methods for details, and the Supplemental Material for the
top 50 skills for each year). We calculate (and show as
stacked bar charts in Fig. 10a) the posting frequency of
three of the fundamental journalism skills within job ads: (1)
‘Journalism’, (2) ‘Editing’, and (3) ‘Writing’. These skills
are counted across all job ads in Australia, regardless of their
occupational class. While Fig. 4 shows that labour demand
for journalists has decreased since 2016, Fig. 10a presents

the more nuanced story that the posting frequency for each
of these core journalism skills has increased every year from
2012 to 2018.
The relative rankings of these three skills have also
increased. For each year, we count the posting frequency
of each unique skill that appears in job ads. We then rank
Prepared using sagej.cls

these skills by posting frequency as a proxy for labour
demand. Fig. 10b shows that the rankings of all three of these
fundamental journalism skills have improved from 2012 to
2018. In other words, not only has the posting frequency of
these three journalism skills increased in job ads, but their
importance relative to all other skills has also increased.
Changing importance of journalism skills. Here, we
aim to determine whether a change occurred in the relative
importance of the core journalism skills over time. Given
the dynamics of skill requirements in job ads, skills can
become increasingly more (or less) similar over time. We use
the similarity measures in Eq. (1) to identify the skills that
are becoming more relevant to being a journalist. Fig. 11a
shows the changes in similarity scores between the skill
‘Journalism’ and each of the eight other top journalism skills
(as per the top yearly journalism skills lists). The greater
the area covered in the radar chart, the greater the similarity
score, with the blue area representing 2014 and the red
area 2018. Visibly in Fig. 11a, ‘Social Media’ related skills
are becoming increasingly relevant for journalists, with the
relative ratio of more traditional skills such as ‘Editing’ and
‘Copy Writing’ diminishing with respect to ‘Social Media’,
from 2014 to 2018.
Occupations that require journalism skills. Here we
study which are the occupations that require most journalism
skills, and their dynamics over time. Given the yearly lists
of top journalism skills (described in Skill Similarity),
we use Eq. (2) to determine the occupations with the
highest intensities of journalism skills, for each year from
2014 to 2018. Intuitively, this allows us adaptively to
identify occupations that become more or less similar
to ‘Journalism’, based on their underlying skill usage. It
also provides a means to assess likely transitions between
occupations, as workers are more likely to transition to
occupations where the underlying skill requirements are
similar (Bechichii et al. 2018). Higher similarity lowers the
barriers to entry from one occupation to another.
Fig. 11b highlights eight top occupations and their journalism skill intensity scores for 2014 and 2018. ‘Reporter’,
‘Editor’, and ‘Copywriter’ cover the highest percentage of
journalism jobs in the dataset, respectively. While the journalism skill intensities of these occupations were relatively

In comparison, ‘Photography’, ‘Communications’, ‘Social

evidence as to where workers with journalism skills might be
finding employment outside of journalism.

Volatility of journalism jobs
Drawn from job ads and employment statistics, our findings
reveal the highly volatile nature of the journalism industry.
Compared to other industries, journalism experiences
dramatic fluctuations that are unpredictable and irregular.
The data also confirms that journalism is an industry in
crisis, particularly since the spread of COVID-19 (see
below). However, the data also reveals surprises, including
that the number of journalism jobs ads and employment
levels increased from 2012 until 2016. Since then, though,
journalism jobs in Australia have been in decline.
The volatility of journalism jobs in Australia is clearly
apparent in Posting Frequency & Employment levels.
Posting frequency of job ads have ranged from near zero
levels in 2012 and 2014 to more than 200 posts per quarter in
2016. These violent swings are also apparent in the quarterly
employment statistics of ‘Journalists and Other Writers’.
Following the mass redundancies of 2012, employment
levels plummeted, reaching their lowest levels in 2013.
They have since increased. However, the data confirms that
volatility of employment has been a constant for journalism,
and that this has worsened during COVID-19.
Fig. 5 reveals this extreme volatility. The error metrics
from the Machine Learning model used to predict daily
posting frequencies of job ads (as detailed in Trend
Analysis & Predictability) highlight the difficulties of
making predictions about journalism employment. This lack
of predictability is indicative of volatility. The higher the
error scores for a given occupation, the higher the likelihood
that the occupation is experiencing significant disruption.
This becomes apparent when we compare journalism to
other occupations. For example, the volatility of ’Journalists’
dwarfs that of ‘Data Scientists’, an occupation experiencing
significant demand and volatility in Australia (Dawson et al.
2019).
The volatility of journalism jobs is further revealed by
a time series analysis of journalism compared to other
occupations (Fig. 4), a gender-based analysis (Fig. 6),
a geographical analysis (Fig. 7) and an analysis of the
temporary nature of journalism jobs (Fig. 9).

compared to the skill ‘Journalism’; (b) Eight occupations that have the highest similarity to the ‘Top Yearly Journalism Skills’.

What is indisputably clear is that the advertising market
for news and journalism has collapsed, and continues to
collapse. Meanwhile, consumers have consistently shown
an unwillingness to pay for digital journalistic content. In
2019, Australian news consumers admitted they would much
would rather subscribe to a video streaming service such
as Netflix (34%), than pay for online news (9%) (DNR
Australia 2019). The Internet has detonated the advertising
model that once sustained journalism, and simultaneously
re-adjusted consumer expectations on the monetary value
of journalism content. The fact that journalism is struggling
is confirmed in several ways by the data, including by the
unpredictability of job ads posting frequency and the clear
shifts in employment levels, as shown in Fig. 1. To say that
journalism is being disrupted is an understatement.
Volatility exacerbated by COVID-19. In a fragmenting
news ecosystem, consumer demand for news and journalism
is difficult to quantify. The Digital News Report: Australia
2019 has found that many consumers are disengaging,
with the proportion of Australians avoiding news increasing
from 57% in 2017 to 62% in 2019 (Fisher et al. 2019).
Demand for ’quality’ and ’public interest’ journalism is
even harder to quantify, given ongoing debates as to what
exactly constitutes ’quality’ and ’public interest’ (Wilding
et al. 2018). Nonetheless, demand for journalism has surged
dramatically since the outbreak of COVID-19. The irony
of the coronavirus pandemic is that even as it has been
killing off journalism jobs, it has also created a heightened
demand for, and appreciation of, journalism among the
general public. As news analyst Doctor (2020) wrote of the
US situation in late March, ’The amount of time Americans
spend with journalists work and their willingness to pay for
it have both spiked, higher than at any point since Election
2016, maybe before ... [but] how many journalists will still
have jobs once the initial virus panic subsides?’. In the UK
in March, The Guardian received 2.17 billion page views, an
increase of more than 750 million above its previous record,
set in October 2019 (Bedingfield 2020).
Prepared using sagej.cls

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the volatility of the
journalism jobs market has worsened dramatically. We
noted above that in early April News Corp suspended the
publication of 60 newspapers nationally. Then, on April
14, Australian Community Newspapers, which publishes
170 community titles, said it was suspending publication
of some of its non-daily newspapers; as a result, four
printing presses were closed and an unspecified number of
staff were stood down (Meade 2020a). The following day,
the federal government announced a $50million package to
support public interest journalism across TV, newspapers and
radio in regional and remote Australia (Hayes and Rubbo
2020). And on April 20, the government announced that
digital platforms including Google and Facebook would be
forced to pay for content as the internet advertising business
would be overhauled to help local publishers survive the
economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis (Crowe 2020). The
scheme, which would involve a mandatory code imposed on
digital giants, would potentially set a global precedent. The
combined and ongoing impact on journalism jobs of these
sudden, cumulative developments are hard to predict, but will
no doubt be profound.

Gender Wage Gap
At first glance, the data seems to suggest that gender equity is
finally arriving in Australia for journalism - an industry that
has traditionally been male-dominated - as more women than
men are employed. As the data shows, in 2014 there were 0.7
female journalists employed for every male Journalist, but
by 2018 the proportion of female-to-male employment more
than doubled, with almost 1.8 female journalists employed
for every male Journalist. It then declined in 2019 to 1.35, a
proportion still almost double that of 2014.
However, further detail reveals that equity remains
elusive. Specifically, wage inequality has worsened. Since
2014, annual salaries for female journalists increased by
AU$3,000, compared with an increase for male journalists of
over AU$30,000 over the same period. From 2014 to 2018,

Dawson et al.

average wage growth for Male journalists was more than
ten times greater than for female journalists. Meanwhile, the
average male Journalist has been getting older, while the
average female Journalist has been getting younger. In 2014,
the average age for a Journalist, whether male or female, was
roughly the same: late 30s. By 2018, the average age for a
male journalist was 42, whereas for a female journalist it was
34.
The potential impacts of this worsening disparity are
concerning. It is likely that senior positions responsible for
major editorial decisions are increasingly being dominated
by men, whereas junior roles are being filled by women who
are younger and worse-paid. This may be having a flow-on
effect as to which news stories are being covered, and how
those stories are being covered. In other words, the gender
gap and age gap may be having an impact on the content of
the news. Further research is needed into related issues of the
industrys composition, including, for instance, the ethnicity
of journalists. A vast body of literature exists regarding the
importance of diversity in news (Rodrigues and Paradies
2018; Budarick and Han 2017). Further work is needed into
diversity (and its various sub-categories), and what effect
diversity has, for instance, on the proportion of people who
are actively avoiding the news.

Location
As discussed above, the sustained pressures on regional and
local journalism have led to a worrying growth of news
deserts in countries including Australia and the US. This
trend has been accelerating alarmingly since the outbreak of
COVID-19, leaving many areas without any regional or local
news coverage. Hence we might assume that journalism jobs
in regional and local areas have been drying up, and that an
ever-increasing proportion of journalism jobs are in urban
centres.
The data, however, is not so clear. As Fig. 7a shows,
in 2012 fewer than a quarter of Australias journalism job
ads were for jobs outside Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,
Canberra and the ACT or Perth. In every subsequent year, the
proportion of job ads for journalism positions outside these
urban centres has been considerably higher. The peak came
in 2017, when nearly half of all job ads were for positions
outside the major cities. Does this suggest that in 2017 there
were as many jobs for journalists in the regions as in the
centres? Surely not. The explanation, we would suggest, lies
in various factors. These include that regional journalism
jobs are hard to fill, perhaps because they offer relatively
low salaries, and are hence re-advertised. It is also possible
that there is a high turnover for some regional positions. In
short, the job ads data may simply be an indication that the
journalism industry is even more volatile in the regions than
in major urban centres.
Research consistently and emphatically reveals that
regional and local journalism are suffering, with an
increasingly bleak prognosis of cuts and closures. While the
data shows a surprisingly high proportion of journalism job
ads for positions outside the main metropolitan centres, this
cannot be taken to suggest that journalism is holding steady
in these areas.

Evolving journalism skills
Skills are the building blocks of jobs and standardised
occupations. In this regard, occupations can be characterised
as ‘sets of skills’. Intuitively, skills that are similar can be
interpreted as complementary when they are paired together
or relatively easy to acquire (in either direction) when one
skill is already possessed.
This intuition provides insight into how journalism skills
are evolving and where journalists might be finding alternate
career paths. As Fig. 1 shows, both the demand for and
supply of journalists have been declining in Australia since
2016. Therefore, a growing number of former journalists,
who presumably possess an assortment of journalism skills,
have needed to transition between occupations to find new
work. There are, however, significant transition costs moving
between jobs (Bechichii et al. 2018; Bessen 2015). These
costs can come in the form of education, training, physically
moving for new employment and other barriers. To reduce
the friction of these transition costs, workers tend to leverage
their extant skills, in concert with acquiring new skills, to
make career transitions.
As seen in Fig. 11a, the skill ‘Journalism’ has become
more similar to ‘Social Media’ and more ‘generalist’
communications skills. After applying the Skill Intensity
formula from Eq. (2), we identified the top occupations
with highest intensities of journalism skills from 20142018. The Fig. 11b chart reinforces that top journalism
skills are becoming more important to other occupations,
such as ‘Photographers’, ‘Social Media Strategists’, ‘Public
Relations Professionals’, and ‘Communications Specialists’.
From the data, we suggest, three conclusions can be
drawn. First, to be hired, journalists are required to have
a wider array of skills, such as photography and social
media aptitude. Second, jobs in journalism are increasingly
jobs in social media, generalist communications, and public
relations rather than in reporting and editing. And third, we
see hints as to where onetime journalists are finding alternate
career paths. As employment conditions progressively
worsen, journalists are seemingly pursuing new careers in
the occupational areas seen in Fig. 11b, such as photography
or public relations.
At a time of great uncertainty, with employment prospects
deteriorating, it is no wonder that journalists look beyond
traditional journalism for their futures. For society, however,
the implications are significant. In this time of economic
uncertainty and polarising politics, the people who possess
the journalism skills required to keep the public informed
and hold leaders to account are, in many cases, employing
their talents elsewhere. This places enormous strain on the
health and quality of journalism in Australia.

Conclusion
The data reveals a contradiction: demand for journalism
skills has increased at the same time that demand and
employment for journalists has declined. Indeed, this is
one of several contradictions in a volatile industry. For
an increasing number of news media organisations, a
sustainable business model remains elusive.
Our findings give a clearer outline of the problem.
Unfortunately, the solutions remain less clear. Quality

12

journalism is expensive. Good reporting is often slow and
laborious, fixed to the unfolding story. What is required of
quality journalism is, therefore, at odds with the prevailing
employment conditions.
This paper highlights the stresses experienced by
journalism in Australia by analysing jobs data. We observe
the volatility and downward trajectory of the occupation both
in job ads and employment statistics. These unfavourable
employment conditions are being worsened by the unfolding
COVID-19 crisis. Our longitudinal analysis also yields
important findings regarding gender inequity. While women
are representing a greater share of employed journalists, they
are earning less, and the wage gap is growing.
Further, this paper has also identified top journalism
skills. Adopting a data-driven method, we described which
skills are most similar to ‘Journalism’. We then used
these yearly skill sets to adaptively similar occupations.
This enabled us to quantitatively show that the skill
demands of journalists are becoming similar to those of
‘Social Media Strategists’, ‘Public Relations Professionals’,
‘Communications Specialists’, and others. This suggests
where people with journalism skills are likely finding
alternate career paths, but also raises a related concern. On
the face of it, the journalism jobs data we have analysed does
not look so bad after all. On reflection, however, it suggests
that the thinning ranks of ‘journalism’ are populated by fewer
journalists, and more public relations specialists.
Future research could compare these results to other
labour markets to assess the validity of these findings. For
example, the skill similarity methodology could be applied in
other labour markets to compare the resulting top journalism
skills in different locations. Additionally, labour demand
analyses could be conducted on occupations most similar to
journalists to better understand the incentives to transition to
other vocations.
The results from this research both reinforce the welldocumented difficulties of journalism in Australia and
provide granular details that isolate and reveal these
challenges. The implications are global. The hope is that
these analytical methods and insights can contribute to the
health and well-being of the Fourth Estate, and hence to the
health and well-being of society.

This document is accompanying the submission Layoffs,
Inequity and COVID-19: A Longitudinal Study of the
Journalism Jobs Crisis in Australia from 2012 to 2020. The
information in this document complements the submission,
and it is presented here for completeness reasons. It is
not required for understanding the main paper, nor for
reproducing the results.

Technical Appendix
Here, we describe the data sources we used to analyse
journalism jobs. We also outline the skill similarity
methodology that enables us to construct temporal (yearly)
sets of top journalism skills. Lastly, we describe how these
temporal sets of top journalism skills then allow us to
adaptively identify occupations that are ‘most similar’ to
journalism, at the granular skill level.

Data Sources
Journalism job ads. This research draws on more than
6.7 million Australian online job ads from 2012-01-01
until 2019-02-28, courtesy of data provided by Burning
Glass Technologies‡ (BGT). BGT also granted access to the
aggregated job ads data from 2019-03-01 to 2020-03-31,
allowing us to address the early impacts of the unfolding
coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on journalism jobs in
Australia. BGT collected the job ads data via web scraping
and systematically processed it into structured formats. The
dataset consists of detailed information on individual job ads,
such as location, salary, employer, educational requirements,
experience demands, and more. The skill requirements have
also been extracted (totalling > 11, 000 unique skills) and
each job ad is classified into its relevant occupational and
industry classes. There are two occupational ontologies in
the job ads dataset. The first is ANZSCO, which is the
official occupational classification standard in Australia and
New Zealand. The other is the BGT occupational ontology,
which has been developed due to shortcomings of official
occupational standards (as described in Related Work &
Background).
To ensure selection accuracy, we instituted the following
search query conditions over the dataset:
1. All job ads with ANZSCO Occupation labels of
‘Newspaper or Periodical Editor’, ‘Print Journalist’,
‘Radio Journalist’, ‘Television Journalist’, and ‘Journalists and Other Writers nec’ (where ‘nec’ stands for
‘not elsewhere classified’).
2. OR All job ads with the BGT Occupation label of
‘Journalist / Reporter’ and ‘Editor’ (the two primary
BGT occupational classes for journalists);
Prepared using sagej.cls

After manually reviewing the returned job ad features for
accuracy, the selection process resulted in a sample of 3,231
Australian journalism job ads from 2012-01-01 until 201902-28. We used the same search query and approach for the
2019-03-01 to 2020-03-31 period to supplement this sample.
This returned 467 journalism job ads, amounting to a total
of 3,698 journalism job ads from 2012-01-01 to 2020-03-31.
The job ads during the period are observed aggregated daily,
with limited skill level details. However, much of the analysis
that follows requires access to the features within individual
job ads, so only Fig. 2 leverages the 2020 data.
Further details on job ads data. It is estimated that
approximately 60% of Australian job ads are posted
online (Department of Employment, Skills, Small and
Family Business 2019). At aggregate levels, online job
advertisements (ads) provide valuable indicators of relative
labour demands. This includes demand features, such as
salaries, educational requirements, years of experience, and,
most importantly, skill-level information. Here, a distinction
must be made between skills, knowledge, abilities, and
occupations. ‘Skills’ are the proficiencies developed through
training and/or experience (OECD 2019); ‘knowledge’ is
the theoretical and/or practical understanding of an area;
‘ability’ is the competency to achieve a task (Gardiner et al.
2018); and ‘occupations’ are standardised jobs that are the
amalgamation of skills, knowledge, and abilities used by
an individual to perform a set of tasks that are required by
their vocation. Throughout this paper, the term ‘skill’ will
incorporate ‘knowledge’ and ‘ability’. Skills, in this sense,
are the constituent elements that workers use to perform
tasks, which ultimately define jobs and occupations.
Advantages of job ads data. Understanding how the
composition of skill sets evolve within an occupation
is essential to understanding trends in that occupation.
However, occupational data rarely captures skill-level data.
Most often, official occupational standards are static, rarely
updated classifications, which fail to capture the changing
skill demands of occupations, or to detect the creation of new
types of jobs.
Journalist employment statistics. Employment data
(labour supply) were collected from the ‘Quarterly Detailed
Labour Force’ statistics by the ABS (Australian Bureau
of Statistics 2019a). These employment data are organised
into standardised occupations called the Australia and New
Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO).
ANZSCO provides a basis for the standardised collection,
analysis and dissemination of occupational data for Australia
and New Zealand. The structure of ANZSCO has five
hierarchical levels - major group, sub-major group, minor
group, unit group and occupation. The categories at the most
detailed level of the classification are termed ’occupations’.
A shortcoming, however, is that the lowest level of
occupational employment data available by the ABS is
at the 4-digit Unit level, which is one hierarchical level
above specific occupations. As our research is focused

data.

Dawson et al.

15

on the employment Unit class of ‘Journalists and Other
Writers’, all ABS employment statistics cited in this
research include the following occupations: ‘Copywriter’,
‘Newspaper or Periodical Editor’, ‘Print Journalist’, ‘Radio
Journalist’, ‘Technical Writer’, ‘Television Journalist’, and
‘Journalists and Other Writers nec’. While the inclusion
of the ‘Copywriter’ and ‘Technical Writer’ occupations in
these statistics could distort results pertaining to ‘Journalists’
to an extent, we consider this impact to be limited in
scope. As we describe in Jobs Data Analysis and Results,
the employment statistics highlight important trends in
journalism occupations, which are confirmed by findings
from the job ads data.
Another shortcoming of employment statistics is their
‘lagging’ nature. The inertia of labour markets means that
it takes time for changes to materialise in employment
statistics. Additionally, the official reporting of employment
statistics takes time. Employment statistics are often
published several months or years after the reported period.
As a result, these ‘lagging’ characteristics are not available
for the most recent periods in our work (such as for the
second half of 2019 and later.)

Skill Similarity
In this section, we detail the methodology previously
employed in (Alabdulkareem et al. 2018; Dawson et al.
2019) to dynamically measure skill similarity. Here, we
present the building blocks for this method, applying it for
journalism related skills and occupations.
Intuition. Two skills are similar when the two are related
and complementary, i.e. the two skills in a skills-pair support
each other. For example, ‘Journalism’ and ‘Editing’ have a
high pairwise similarity score because together they enable
higher productivity for the worker, and because the difficulty
to acquire either skill when one is already possessed by a
worker is relatively low.
Our goal, therefore, is to calculate the similarity of each
unique skill relative to every other unique skill in the dataset.
Such a measure allows us to identify which skills have the
highest pairwise similarities to a specific skill or set of skills.
We also want to identify how skill similarity evolves over
time. To achieve this, we have instituted a temporal split of a
calendar year. This enables us to assess yearly changes to the
underlying skill demands of journalism jobs.
The Revealed Comparative Advantage of a skill.
We implement a data-driven methodology to measure
the pairwise similarity between pairs of skills that cooccur in job ads. One difficulty we encounter is that
some skills are ubiquitous, occurring across many job
ads and occupations. We address this issue by using the
Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA), which maximises
the amount of skill-level information obtained from each
job ad, while minimising the biases introduced by overexpressed skills in job ads. Formally, RCA measures the
relevance of a skill s for a particular job ad j as:
x(j, s)/
RCA(j, s) = P
j 0 ∈J

Prepared using sagej.cls

x(j, s0 )
P
x(j 0 , s0 )

j 0 ∈J,s0 ∈S

higher is the comparative advantage that s is considered
to have for j. Visibly, RCA(j, s)P
decreases when the skill
s is more ubiquitous (i.e. when
x(j 0 , s) increases), or
j 0 ∈J

when many
skills are required for the job j (i.e.
P other
when
x(j, s0 ) increases). RCA provides a method to
s0 ∈S

measure the importance of a skill in a job ad, relative to
the total share of demand for that skill in all job ads. It
has been applied across a range of disciplines, such as trade
economics (Hidalgo et al. 2007) (Vollrath 1991), identifying
key industries in nations (Shutters et al. 2016), and detecting
the labour polarisation of workplace skills (Alabdulkareem
et al. 2018).
Measure skill similarity. The next step is measuring the
complementarity of skill-pairs that co-occur in job ads. First,
we compute the ‘effective use of skills’ e(j, s) defined as
e(j, s) = 1 when RCA(j, s) > 1 and e(j, s) = 0 otherwise.
Finally, we compute the skill complementarity (denoted θ) as
the minimum of the conditional probabilities of a skills-pair
being effectively used within the same job ad. Skills s and
s0 are considered as highly complementary if they tend to
commonly co-occur within individual job ads, for whatever
reason. Formally:
P
e(j, s).e(j, s0 )
j 0 ∈J
0
!
(4)
θ(s, s ) =
P
P
max
e(j, s),
e(j, s0 )
j 0 ∈J

j 0 ∈J

Note that θ(s, s0 ) ∈ [0, 1], a larger value indicates that s and
s0 are more similar, and it reaches the maximum value when
s and s0 always co-occur (i.e. they never appear separately).
Top journalism skills. Following the procedure outlined
in (Dawson et al. 2019) for building sets of highly
complementary skills, we use the θ function together
with ‘Journalism’ as the ‘seed’ skill to create top yearly
lists of journalism skills. More precisely, we compute
θ(Journalism, s) – i.e. the similarity between the skill
‘Journalism’ and each unique skill that occurs during a
given year. Skills on each yearly list are ordered by their
descending pairwise skill similarity scores. When inspecting
the yearly skill lists, we make two observations. First, the
skills in 2012 and 2013 appear of notably lower quality
than from 2014 onward. We posit that this has to do with
imperfect skills extraction methods during the early years
of the BGT dataset. As a result, we decided to measure
the top yearly journalism skill sets from 2014 to 2018 (the
last available full year of data for which we had access). §
Second, we decided to retain only the top 50 skills on each
yearly list. Through qualitative analysis, we determined that
this threshold of 50 is both sufficiently exclusive for defining

P

s0 ∈S

x(j 0 , s)/

where x(j, s) = 1 when the skill s is required for job j,
and x(j, s) = 0 otherwise; S is the set of all distinct skills,
and

journalism skills and reasonably inclusive for detecting
the evolution of new, emerging skills in journalism. The
purpose of these top journalism skills lists is to capture
journalism labour trends; it is not intended to represent a
complete taxonomy of journalism skills. The yearly lists
of top journalism skills, and their similarity scores, can be
observed in the Supplemental Material Sec. Top Journalism
Skills by Year.
Compute journalism skill intensity. For the occupational
similarity analysis in Sec. Journalism Skills, we decided to
use the BGT occupational ontology as opposed to ANZSCO.
This is because the BGT occupational classes appear more
reflective of current job titles. For example, a job title
advertised for a ‘Social Media Manager’ is classified by BGT
as a ‘Social Media Strategist / Specialist’. Whereas the same
job title would be classified by ANZSCO as an ‘Advertising
Specialist’ or ‘Marketing Specialist’.

Trend Analysis & Predictability
We use the Prophet time-series forecasting tool developed
by Facebook Research (Taylor and Letham 2018). Prophet
is an auto-regressive tool that fits non-linear time-series
trends with the effects from daily, weekly, and yearly
seasonality, and also holidays. The main model components
are represented in the following equation:
y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + t

(5)

where g(t) refers to the trend function that models nonperiodic changes over time; s(t) represents periodic changes,
such as seasonality; h(t) denotes holiday effects; and t is the
error term and represents all other idiosyncratic changes.

Quantify Labour Demand Volatility
We evaluate the forecasting performance using a temporal
holdout setup. That is, we split the available time-series
into a training part (the first part of the sequence) and
a testing part (the latter part of the sequence). We train
the Prophet model on the training part, and we generate
job ad posting forecasts by “running time forward” in
Eq. (5) for time t in the testing period. Finally, we measure
the accuracy of the forecast against the observed posting
volumes using the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (SMAPE) (Scott Armstrong 1985; Makridakis 1993).
SMAPE is formally defined as:
T

SM AP E(At , Ft ) =

200 X |Ft − At |
T t=1 (|At | + |Ft |)

(6)

where At denotes the actual value of jobs posted on day t,
and Ft is the predicted value of job ads on day t. SMAPE
ranges from 0 to 200, with 0 indicating a perfect prediction
and 200 the largest possible error. When actual and predicted
values are both 0, we define SMAPE to be 0. We selected
SMAPE as an alternative to the more widely used MAPE
because it is (1) scale-independent and (2) robust to actual
or predicted zero values. To evaluate the uncertainty of
the forecast, we adopt a ‘sliding window’ approach. This
consists of using a constant number of training days (here
1, 186 days) to train the model, and we test the forecasting
performance on the next 365 days. We then shift both the
Prepared using sagej.cls

training and the testing periods right by one day, and the
process is repeated. Consequently, we train and test the
model 365 times, and we obtain 365 SMAPE performance
values.
