Summary
Background
Recent seroprevalence studies have tried to estimate the real number of
asymptomatic cases affected by COVID-19. It is of paramount importance
to understand the impact of these infections in order to prevent a second
wave. This study aims to model the interactions in the population by means
of a complex network and to shed some light on the effectiveness of localised
control measures in Italy in relation to the school opening in mid-September.
Methods
The formulation of an epidemiological predictive model is given: the advantage of using this model lies in that it discriminates between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases of COVID-19 as the interactions with these
two categories of infected individuals are captured separately, allowing for a

study on the impact of asymptomatic cases. This model is then extended to a
structured nonhomogeneous version by means of the Watts-Strogatz complex
network, which is adopted widely to model societal interactions as it holds
the small world property. Finally, a case study on the situation in Italy is
given: first the homogeneous model is used to compare the official data with
the data of the recent seroprevalence study from Istat; second, in view of the
return to school in mid-September, a study at regional level is conducted.
Findings
The proposed model captures an aspect of COVID-19 which is crucial in
controlling the further spread of the contagion and in preventing a second
wave: the interactions with undetected cases who have therefore not been
isolated, mostly asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, namely 1-2 symptoms
without anosmia or ageusia, and their impact on latent infections. The evolution of the pandemic is well captured by model fitting with official data
from the Protezione Civile, both at a national level as well as regional level.
The case study provides insight on the potential effects of localised restrictions, without the coordination at a national level. The results of this study
highlight the importance of coordinating the deployment of appropriate control measures that take into account the role of asymptomatic infections,
especially in younger individuals, and inter-regional connectivity in Italy.
Interpretation
It is vital to adhere to the prescribed public health measures in order to
delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent a second wave with potential
disruptive national lockdowns. Asymptomatic infected are estimated to be
around a third of the official data, but their real number can be much higher
if the individuals with one or two minor symptoms are included. The results emphasise the need for coordinated control measures that account for
the interactions among different regions in Italy, and potentially among the
countries in Europe.

Introduction
The COVID-19 respiratory syndrome, associated with the novel strand
of Coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, has had a massive impact worldwide.
Initially found in Wuhan, in the heart of Hubei Province, China,1 it has
quickly spread since last December to almost every country in the world,
with the most affected being the US, Spain, UK, Italy, France, Germany,
Russia, Turkey, Iran, and China. This has caused severe consequences and a
large number of deaths, mostly due to the ease of transmission, i.e. the virality, of this disease. For an infectious disease outbreak such as the one caused
by COVID-19, predictive mathematical models play an important role for
the planning of effective control strategies. Among the models formulated
over the years,2, 3 the susceptible-infected-recovered model (SIR) is possibly
one of the most used epidemiological models: the population is split into
three stages of infection, sometimes called compartments, thus the terminology compartmental models, as reported in an early work by Kermack and
McKendrick in 1927.4 A variant of these classic compartmental models used
to tackle the specific features of SARS can be found in the work of Gumel et
al.5 and similar equations can be found in the framework developed for the
HIV transmission in heterogeneous populations.6
Several aspects of this virus have been investigated: some research assessed the effectiveness of different response strategies,7 other authors focused on modelling the various stages of the disease and the death rate, as
done in a seminal work by Giordano et al.8 Early research in China showed
unique epidemiological traits of the COVID-19 virus,9 most notably the fact
that a large portion of transmissions were caused by asymptomatic individuals, whether they were showing mild or no symptoms at all. Indeed,
further research demonstrated that asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals have the same viral load and thus the same capability to further spread
the virus,10 and the work of Rothe et al. for a case of transmission from an
asymptomatic individual in Germany.11 In the context of data driven models, Bertozzi et al. find a relation between branching point processes and
classical compartmental models such as susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)
and susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR), whilst fitting the models
with data from a variety of countries, including China, Italy, Japan, and
other countries.12 A study that investigates whether daily test reports can
help authorities to control the epidemic,13 discusses how mitigation strategies can fail when modelled because of various factors, such as delay, unstable
3

dynamics, and uncertainty in the feedback loop. For the Italian situation,
the work of Della Rossa et al. provides interesting insight on the need to coordinate the efforts in controlling the situations in an inter-regional setting,
and highlights the need of such coordination by means of a network model.14
In the work of Yilmaz et al., the authors discuss how to identify and analyze bridges between communities in graphs with the purpose to understand
how to track and where to start tests on which individuals.15 Another study
includes a particle-based mean field model that investigates the pros and
cons of social distancing through an approach that compares individuals to
molecules in a solution.16 A very early model of this disease was given in the
work by Calafiore et al., where the novelty lies in including a proportionality
factor in a standard SIR model to account for hidden infections.17 In a model
on the case for the UK, the authors account for four main elements and a
finer level of detail for each of them in assessing the impact of the speed in
which the immunity is lost.18 A risk sensitivity analysis on the economic
impact of the disease where the optimising behaviour of agents to influence
future transitions is considered by the work by Garibaldi et al.19 The work
of Pastor-Satorras provides a survey of the literature on complex networks
for epidemic processes20 , and applications of complex networks to epidemic
processes in evolutionary dynamics can be found in the work by Tan et al.21

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Italy has been the first European country to face the challenges brought
by the COVID-19 pandemic. Predictive mathematical models are a
useful tool to understand the proportion of this pandemic and consider different control measures, but few have considered the impact
of asymptomatic in a structured setting, where the structure is captured by complex networks. Our search spanned from medical journals
from PubMed in general and specific sources in control and data driven
modelling until August 31, 2020, using the terms “control” and “data
driven modelling”, without date or language restrictions. As for the
databases, we used the official data from the Italian Ministry of Health
and the Istat seroprevalence study. Seroprevalence studies are recent
in many European countries and many works considered them in modelling the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The impact of asymptomatic
infected must be understood to prevent a second wave of this virus.
Added value of this study
This is one of the first studies that uses data from the Istat seroprevalence analysis to model the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 at national
and regional levels in Italy with emphasis on modelling the interactions between susceptible individuals and asymptomatic infected. Our
study proposes a predictive model, inspired by classical epidemiological models, that emphasises the impact of asymptomatic infected in
spreading the disease through a measure of the interactions in the population. This study analyses the possible scenarios following the return
to schools in mid-September by capturing the heterogeneity in the population by means of complex networks, graphs that mimic real features
present in biological, computer and social networks. Finally, our case
study for the Italian case confirms that only a coordinated policy at
national and regional levels can be effective in controlling the virus in
the forthcoming months.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study can serve as a reference to study the situation in other contexts and countries, suggesting similar outcomes for a multi-national
approach in the European case or in the US. Because of the present
difficulty to reach herd immunity without counting a large number of
deaths due to the inability of health systems to face the speed in which
this disease spreads, our results suggest, in line with previous evidence
and data driven models, that the 5only way to monitor this disease is
through coordinated action and monitoring of the asymptomatic or
paucisymptomatic infected.

Methods
Epidemic Model
In this section, we present the formulation of the model that we propose,
which takes inspiration from notorious compartmental models such as the
widely used susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, and more precisely
from the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model. The peculiarity of a compartmental model is that the population is divided into a discrete
set of states and individuals can only exist in these states: for instance, in
the SIR model, individuals can be susceptible to the virus (healthy), contract
the virus and thus be infected, and finally be immune to the virus when they
recover. This model accounts for those diseases that do provide long term
immunity to future infections from the same virus through the presence of
antibodies in the host organism.
We named our model SAIR, because of the state variables we chose to
include: Susceptible, Asymptomatic infected, symptomatic Infected and Removed. We choose to use the term removed in place of the more common
recovered because we do not discriminate between individuals who recover
from the disease and individuals who passed away. The term removed is
also used commonly in the literature, and in important contributions in the
field.22 As previously mentioned, our model is a variant of the susceptibleexposed-infected-recovered (SEIR),23 but with notable differences:
• Our study focuses on the impact of the undetected asymptomatic individuals in spreading the virus. Some of these can show symptoms at
a later stage of the disease, and we assume that in an initial stage no
individuals show symptoms.
• We provide an estimation of the parameters of infection through a
case study for Italy. We estimate the ratio between asymptomatic and
symptomatic infected and support our work with the estimate from the
Istat seroprevalence study.24
• We investigate the impact of the lockdown measures in controlling the
spread of the virus, by modelling the frequency of contacts among the
individuals in the population via an average number of contacts, first,
and then through the small-world complex network model.
The susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-removed (SAIR) model that we
present in the following is a discrete-state continuous-time system. In a first
6

approximation, individuals are considered homogeneous, namely they share
the same properties when in the same state (or compartment). The state
variables of the model represent the densities of susceptible, asymptomatic
infected, symptomatic infected and removed individuals. These quantities
are denoted by S(t), A(t), I(t) and R(t), respectively. Each state variable
belongs to R+
0 . In the mean-field limit, the following system of ODEs describes the time evolution of the population:

Ṡ(t) = −S(t)(k̄1 γA(t) + k̄2 λI(t)),



Ȧ(t) = S(t)(k̄1 γA(t) + k̄2 λI(t)) − A(t)(α + σ),
(1)
˙ = αA(t) − µI(t),

I(t)


Ṙ(t) = σA(t) + µI(t),

where the uppercase Latin letters represent the known densities, k̄1 and k̄2
describe the average number of contacts per unit time with asymptomatic
and symptomatic infected individuals, respectively, and the lowercase Greek
letters represent the parameters of the system. In particular, these parameters are positive quantities and have the following physical interpretation: γ
and λ denote the microscopic transmission rate, the former due to contacts
between a susceptible person and an asymptomatic infected, the latter due to
contacts between a susceptible person and a symptomatic infected; infected
individuals decay into the removed class at rate σ from the asymptomatic
infected state and at rate µ from the symptomatic infected state, respectively; finally, α is the rate in which asymptomatic individuals start to have
symptoms.
System (1) is a nonlinear positive system, more precisely it is bilinear,
since the highest degree that we have is at most two, namely the multiplication between two state variables. The fact that the system is positive
means that, given an initial condition S(0), A(0), I(0), R(0) ≥ 0, all the state
variables take nonnegative values for t ≥ 0. Furthermore, through the con˙ + Ṙ(t) = 0, all state variables
servation of mass, namely Ṡ(t) + Ȧ(t) + I(t)
are linked through the normalisation condition:
S(t) + A(t) + I(t) + R(t) = 1,

meaning that the sum of all the state variables is constant at any given time
and equal to one.
A few considerations follow. In the work of Giordano et al.,8 γ > λ,
due to the fact that people are more likely in contact with, or closer to,

asymptomatic infected individuals rather than with people that show clear
symptoms. In our case, we model the interactions among individuals via
k̄1 and k̄2 , and it is obvious to conclude that, in general, k̄1 > k̄2 for the
same reason. Finally, in our model we assume the homogeneous mixing hypothesis,2 which asserts that the rate of infection per capita of the susceptible
individuals is proportional to the number of people already infected. Because
of this hypothesis, system (1) is treated as a mean-field model where the rate
of contacts between susceptibles and both symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals is assumed constant, independently of any source of heterogeneity present in the system. Figure 1 depicts the Markov chain corresponding
to system (1).
Let z(t) = [S(t) A(t) I(t) R(t)]T , system (1) can be rewritten in matrix
form as:

where the dependence on time is implicit, e.g. S := S(t), for the sake of
brevity. As depicted in Fig. 2, the above system can be rewritten in feedback

Lemma 1. Given an initial state z0 = [S0 x0 R0 ], system (2) admits the
following equilibria: z ∗ = (S̄, 0, R̄), with S̄ + R̄ = 1.

Proof of Lemma 1. System (2) admits the equilibria given by (S̄, 0, 0, R̄),
with S̄ + R̄ = 1. This follows from either S = 0 or k̄1 γA + k̄2 λI = 0, which
in turns means A = I = 0 (or both at the same time).
In the first case, if S = 0, Ȧ = 0 and I˙ = 0, if and only if A = 0 and
I = 0, and Ṙ = 0.
In the second case, if A = I = 0, then Ȧ = I˙ = 0 and also Ṙ = 0. This
concludes our proof.

A fundamental result on the asymptotic stability of the system in feedback
form is given in the following theorem, where R0 is the basic reproduction
number defined as the H∞ norm of the transfer function of system (3)-(5)
with constant feedback S̄.
Theorem 1. The feedback system in (3)-(5) with constant feedback S̄ is
asymptotically stable if and only if

We can calculate the H∞ norm of G(s) as in the following:
G(0) =

(α + σ)µ

which is equal to the static gain Gk (0) due to the fact that we have a positive
system. By standard root locus argument on the positive system for Gk (s),
all the roots of the polynomial are in the left-hand plane, i.e. Hurwitz, if and

This concludes our proof.

Theorem 2. For positive initial conditions, the limit values of S̄ = limt→∞ S(t)

The above formula provides that the following inequality holds true: S̄ ≤
S(0) ≤ 1. Finally, we can calculate R̄ by taking into account equation (7)
and the equation (9) above as in the following:
R̄ = R(0) + EF −1 x(0) + EF −1 b(S(0) − S̄).
11

Note that R0 = −cF −1 b is the basic reproduction number which is the H∞
norm of the system in feedback form. This concludes our proof.

We now extend our study to assess the presence of a nonzero epidemic
threshold for the infection rates in our model. The epidemic prevalence is
defined as the total number of infected individuals at the end of the epidemic.
This threshold can be seen as the limit above which a finite number of individuals get the virus after its spread in the population, namely the epidemic
prevalence attains a finite value. On the other hand, if the infection rate
is below this threshold, the epidemic prevalence is null.22 Let us consider
system (1) and, without lack of generality, set the initial conditions R(0) = 0
and S(0) ≃ 1, which implies that only a very small number of infected individuals A(0) = I(0) ≃ 0 is present at the start of the epidemic. The following
result provides the value of the epidemic threshold for our case.
Theorem 3. Consider system (1) with initial conditions R(0) = 0, A(0) =
I(0) ≃ 0, S(0) ≃ 1. This system admits a nonzero epidemic prevalence if
and only if:

which can be simplified by taking into account the initial conditions, namely
S(0) ≃ 1 and I(0) = R(0) = 0 as specified in the statement of the theorem, and the fact that at the end of the epidemic the number of infected is
limt→∞ I(t) = 0 as in the following:
S̄ = e−R0 R̄ ,
where the total number of infected R̄ = limt→∞ R(t) and R0 is the basic
reproduction number as defined in Theorem 1. We can now combine the
above equation with the normalization condition and we can see that the
total number of infected R̄ fulfils the following equation:
R̄ = 1 − e−R0 R̄ .
A trivial solution of the above equation is R̄ = 0, but we seek nonzero
solutions that are consistent to the stability condition in Theorem 1, for
which the following must hold:

Finally, in order to assess the impact of the asymptomatic infected, we
now study the dynamics of the ratio between the symptomatic infected and

Heterogeneous Interaction Model
In the previous section, we have studied the model where all individuals
in the population are homogeneous, namely they are indistinguishable, as
they have the same value to measure the average number of contacts. In
this section, we extend the previous model to address the effects of contact
heterogeneity in the form of complex networks. Given a large population,
let P (k) be the probability distribution of the node degrees for a complex
network representing the interactions of the individuals in the population.
Moreover, let hki be the mean value of the connectivity in the population.
P
[k]
Let θi (t) := hf1i k kP (k)xi (t) be the probability that a randomly chosen
[k]

link will point to xi (t) in (3), namely an asymptomatic infected for i =
1 for any class k, and a symptomatic infected for i = 2 for any class k,
where hf i represents the mean value of the connectivity in the population.
Finally, let ψi,k := k/ki,max , where ki,max is the maximum number of contacts
without restrictions. Parameters ψi,k describe the connectivity towards the
asymptomatic and symptomatic infected for i = 1 and i = 2, respectively.
When k = ki,max for all k, we return to the homogeneous case.
Let zk (t) = [Sk (t) Ak (t) Ik (t) Rk (t)]T be the population state at time t of
connectivity k. The magnitudes Sk (t), Ak (t), Ik (t) and Rk (t) represent the
density of the susceptible, asymptomatic infected, symptomatic infected and
14

removed nodes of connectivity k at time t, respectively. As before, these
variables must satisfy the normalization condition for each k ∈ Z:
Sk (t) + Ak (t) + Ik (t) + Rk (t) = 1.
For each population k ∈ Z, system (1) becomes:

Ṡk (t) = −Sk (t)(ψ1,k γθ1 (t) + ψ2,k λθ2 (t)),




 k
Ṙk (t) = σAk (t) + µIk (t).

(15)

Each node of the network represents an individual and their corresponding
state, i.e. susceptible, asymptomatic infected, symptomatic infected and
removed. In matrix form, where the dependence on time is implicit for the
sake of brevity, the above system becomes:

where the system is with constant feedback S̄, c = [cT1 cT2 · · · cTn ]T and

diag(a) is the matrix whose diagonal is a for any vector a, and A ⊗ B is the
Kronecker product between matrix A and matrix B. Matrix ABIG for the
whole system is the following:
ABIG = IN ⊗ F + diag(b)diag(S̄)cP.

(23)

We are now ready to establish the next result, which assesses the stability
of each subsystem with connectivity k in feedback form in (17)-(19).
Theorem 5. The subsystem for class of connectivity k in (17)-(19) with
constant feedback S̄k is asymptotically stable if and only if
S̄k < S̄k∗ =

Proof of Theorem 5. The transfer function from uk to yk for each subsystem
for class of connectivity k is Gk (s) = ck (sI2 − F )−1 b. We can explicitly
calculate it as:

We can calculate the H∞ norm of Gk (s) which is equal to the static gain
Gk (0) as we are in the presence of a positive system as in the following:
Gk (0) =

ψ1,k γµ + ψ2,k λα
.
hf i(α + σ)µ

As for the original model, we use the standard root locus argument on the
positive system Gk (s), and all the roots of the polynomial are in the left-hand
plane, i.e. Hurwitz, if and only if
S̄k < S̄k∗ =

hf i(α + σ)µ
,
ψ1,k γµ + ψ2,k λα

where S̄k∗ = 1/Gk (0) as defined before. Furthermore, we define the basic
reproduction number R0,k for class of connectivity k as
R0,k :=

ψ1,k γµ + ψ2,k λα
1
,

G

hf i(α + σ)µ

which is the H∞ norm of the transfer function Gk (s), and the equilibrium is
stable for S̄k R̄0,k < 1. This concludes our proof.

The next theorem extends the previous result to the system (22), consisting of all classes of connectivity.

stable if and only if

as:

j
Proof of Theorem 6. The condition R0,net diag(S̄) < I is equivalent to saying
that the largest eigenvalue of system (22) must be less than one, namely
R0,k < 1, ∀k. We calculate
det(sI − ABIG ) = 0,
from which we have
det(I2 − P (sI2N − diag(F ))−1diag(b)diag(S̄)c) = 0.
The above equation can be rewritten as

where we can now set s = 0 to get to the following:

iP (i)S̄i [c1,i µ + c2,i α].
i

From the above, we find the formula in (25). This concludes our proof.

Similarly to the homogeneous case, we provide a calculation of the nonzero
epidemic threshold in the case of structured environment. Without loss of
generality, let us consider system (15) with the following initial conditions,
identical for all classes k: Rk (0) = 0 and Sk (0) ≃ 1, for which Ak (0) =
Ik (0) ≃ 0. We find an expression for the epidemic threshold in the case of
complex networks in the following result.

18

Theorem 7. Consider system (15) with initial conditions Rk (0) = 0, Ak (0) =
Ik (0) ≃ 0, Sk (0) ≃ 1. This system admits a nonzero epidemic prevalence if
and only if:
R0,k < γc

ψ1,k
ψ2,k σ

hf i(α + σ)
hf i(α + σ)µ

where γc and λc are the thresholds for the structured case and are defined as
in the following:
γc ,

hf i(α + σ)
(1 − p),
ψ1,k

λc ,

hf i(α + σ)µ
p,
ψ2,k σ

(26)

where p defines the convex space and thus takes values in [0 1].
Proof of Theorem 7. Consider the equation for Sk (t) in system (15), and let
us integrate it as in the following:
Sk (t) = Sk (0)e−

Rt

φk (τ )dτ

where the integral is defined as

(28)

By taking into account the initial conditions, namely Sk (0) ≃ 1 and
Ik (0) = Rk (0) = 0, and the fact that at the end of the epidemic the number
of infected is limt→∞ Ik (t) = 0, the following holds:
S̄ = e−R0,k R̄k ,
where the total number of infected for each class k is R̄k = limt→∞ R(t) and
R0,k is the basic reproduction number from Theorem 5. We can now combine
19

the above equation with the normalization condition and we can see that the
total number of infected R̄k fulfils the following equation:
R̄k = 1 − e−R,k 0R̄k .
As before, we can find a trivial solution of the above equation for R̄k = 0,
but for nonzero solutions that are consistent to the stability condition in
Theorem 5, the following must hold:

d 
1 − e−R0,k R̄k

R̄k =0

< 1.

The above condition is equivalent to the following:
R0,k < γc

hf i(α + σ)µ

which corresponds to the epidemic thresholds in (26). This concludes our
proof.

Numerical Analysis: Small World Network
In this section, we present the numerical analysis conducted on the WattsStrogatz model to show the impact of heterogeneous connectivity in system (15). For the purpose of illustration, we consider a WS model for
N = 1000 nodes, given hki = 2m and m = 4. To generate the network
we use a discretised version of the following formula
P (k) =

m(k−m)
(k − m)!e−m

for k ≥ m,

(29)

where the node degrees vary between 4 and 14. The discretised version is
obtained from discarding the values less than 4 and greater than 14, and
rounding up the fractions of the populations in the other classes such that
the total population across the classes sums up to 1. We also set p = 1,
where p is the probability of rewiring a node from the starting ring graph,
each node being connected to its 2m nearest neighbours.25 Figure 4 shows

20

Figure 4: Small world network with N = 1000, m = 4 and p = 1, where the colour of each
node corresponds to its node degree as in the colorbar.

the corresponding WS complex network, where each node has a colour corresponding to its node degree as in the colorbar on the right of the figure.
Figure 5 shows the histogram of the node degrees for all nodes in the network.
For the simulations, we consider a WS complex network with N = 107
nodes, hki = 2m = 8 and k2,max /k1,max = 0.4. The parameters for each
class of connectivity are shown in Table 1, whilst the constant parameters
are set as in the following: γ = 0.447, σ = 0.087, λ = 0.469, µ = 0.0523, and
α = 0.115.
Finally, we update ψ1k and ψ2k by decreasing them by 0.005 and 0.00135
of their initial value after t > 10. Figures 6-7 depict the propagation of the
disease for each class in terms of the asymptomatic and symptomatic infected
first, namely Ak (t) and Ik (t), and then in terms of the removed, i.e. Rk (t).
Each class is shown in a different colour corresponding to the colorbar on the
right hand side.

Results
In this section, we validate our models with the official data from Dipartimento della Protezione Civile,26, 27 and also we provide an investigation
on the impact of asymptomatic infected through the recent seroprevalence
study conducted by Istat.24 We provide two case studies, the first one via
the homogeneous model and the second one via complex networks. The first
case study includes two sets of simulations: in the first one, we use the official data to tune the parameters of our model and we compare this with the
total cumulative infected and with the estimated number of individuals with
antibodies found in the seroprevalence study; in the second one, we do the
opposite, i.e. we fit our model with the seroprevalence study and compare
our model to the official data. In the second case study, we investigate the
interactions among individuals from different regions in Italy, first. Finally,

Homogeneous Model: Data and Seroprevalence Study
In the first investigation, we use the official data to fit our model and
estimate the parameters and then we compare our model to the value of
the Istat seroprevalence study. We set the portion of the population in each
stage as: A(0) = 94/(60 ∗ 106 ), I(0) = 127/(60 ∗ 106 ), R(0) = 0, and S(0) =
1 − A(0) − I(0) − R(0), where these values are taken from the data for
the isolated at home and hospitalised infected.27 The reason behind this
choice is that we believe that people that are not hospitalised must either be
asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic and thus would fall in our category of

asymptomatic infected. The other parameters are set as in the following:
γ = 0.46952, σ = 0.025501, k̄1 = 0.99209,
λ = 0.48521, µ = 0.10004, k̄2 = 0.65056,
α = 0.185017.
To have an initial estimate of the parameters, we used an implementation of a non-linear least squares regression, using the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm.28 This is an iterative optimisation algorithm that fits a function
to a desired output, obtaining the parameters that minimises the square error between the output of the function and the objective value given. In
this specific case, the values that were fit were the number of symptomatic
active cases and the number of removed. This algorithm is widely used because of its versatility and efficient use of data, even on small datasets.29
However, it is very sensitive to the hyperparameters so an educated initial

estimation of them was provided as well as the specific range of values that
each parameter could take. These parameter values, which were analytically
extracted, were used as a starting point, and were later adapted to better
match the empirical results. Due to the similar viral load between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals,10 we set the values of γ and λ to be
very close. Parameter k̄1 is chosen to be larger than k̄2 at the start (and
also in future time instants), because it accounts for the likelihood that people interact with asymptomatic individuals more likely than with infected
that show symptoms. On March 6th, prime minister Giuseppe Conte imposed a set of localised lockdowns to isolate the outbreaks, and on March
9th a national quarantine was imposed, which restricted the movements of
the population and therefore their contacts and interactions. We account for
this by lowering the values of k̄1 and k̄2 slowly over the days following the
lockdown, down to k̄1 = 0.2957 and k̄2 = 0.0305 before the end of the quarantine period. Following the ease of the lockdown measures, we set k̄1 = 0.3636
and k̄2 = 0.0594 to account for the increased interactions during mid-August
holidays. At the end of February and thus before the lockdown, we calculate
R0 = 4.98, in accordance with studies that place it between 2 and 5.30, 31, 32, 33
Towards the end of the quarantine, the value of R0 goes below 1 and then
it oscillates around R0 = 1.06 during August. As it can be seen in Fig. 8,
our model matches quite accurately the recovered and hospitalised infected,

but it does not do the same with the asymptomatic infected. Even in that
case, we can see from Fig. 9 that our estimation of the cumulative infected
is higher that the confirmed cases. It is matching quite closely an early estimate of the undetected asymptomatic being around 30%, but far away from
the current Istat estimate depicted in red. In accordance with Theorem 3,
the ratio I¯˜ = 1.7041, which is the exact ratio between I¯ and Ā. When using the work of Böhning et al. to estimate the hidden infection, we obtain
almost identical values, namely a number of 264240 hidden infected.34 This
value would account for twice as many infected individuals as the number of
detected infections, but it is underestimated if compared with seroprevalence
studies.24, 35
In the second investigation, we use the seroprevalence study to fit our
model and estimate its parameters. We set the initial conditions as in the

γ = 0.46952, σ = 0.065501, k̄1 = 0.99209,
λ = 0.48521, µ = 0.15004, k̄2 = 0.65056,
α = 0.050017.
During the days following the local and national quarantine, we lower the
values of k̄1 and k̄2 to 0.1916 and 0.0478, respectively, and then we account for
the increased connectivity during August by setting them to k̄1 = 0.2738 and
k̄2 = 0.0971. The basic reproduction number is calculated as R0 = 4.9432
at the beginning of the pandemic, and R0 = 1.2490 at the end of August.
As it can be seen in Fig. 10, our model matches hospitalised infected very
accurately, but it suggests a higher number of asymptomatic and removed
to balance for matching the value of the seroprevalence study. As it is done
in the previous case, we interpolate the value of the seroprevalence study

by using an exponential regression as depicted in red in Fig. 11. We chose
the parameters such that our estimation of the cumulative infected, i.e. the
purple dotted curve, matches the predicted infected from the seroprevalence
study. In accordance with Theorem 3, the ratio is in this case I¯˜ = 0.2446,
which corresponds to the ratio between I¯ and Ā. We explicitly calculate
the total number of people that have contracted the disease through our
model by subtracting the confirmed deaths from the Removed state. We
estimate a total of 8.48 ∗ 105 individuals who contracted that disease and
are currently healthy. Most of these individuals were undetected because of
being asymptomatic.
Complex Networks: Model vs Data
Now, we use the proposed structured model, namely system (15), to investigate the outcome of an event such as the school opening in September.
We set the initial conditions as in the data,27 where we take the regional
29

data and set different parameters of connectivity ψ1,k and ψ2,k depending on
the region and the corresponding exposure to the virus in Italy. We set the
general parameters of the model as
γ = 0.49952, σ = 0.05050, α = 0.03351,
λ = 0.59952, µ = 0.15044.

The population in each class is split according to the discretised version of the Watts-Strogatz used in the numerical analysis. The discretised
distribution is the same as the actual population of each region in Italy:
[0.022 0.009 0.032 0.096 0.073 0.02 0.098 0.026 0.166 0.025 0.005 0.009 0.009 0.072
0.068 0.027 0.083 0.062 0.015 0.002 0.081], where each value is the portion of
the whole population in Italy to the corresponding region ordered alphabetically, i.e. Abbruzzo for number 1, Basilicata for number 2 and so on. As in
the previous case study, we gradually lower the values of ψ1,k and ψ2,k around
the lockdown date and the following few days. Then, we fit our model with
the data until August 29th, and then simulate what would happen in the
event that schools open in mid-September. We start raising the connectivity
values in correspondence of mid-late August, to account for the tourists coming to Italy and for the citizens returning from abroad. We increase these
values further in correspondence to the opening of schools in mid-September.
It is worth noting that the increase is proportional to the value of ψ1,k and
ψ2,k , namely we increase these parameters of 1% of their actual value at
time t, for each class of connectivity k. Therefore, regions with a higher
connectivity (taken from fitting the model to the data) would have a higher
increase.
As it can be seen in Fig. 12, our model captures the evolution of the
cumulative infected for all regions with an error of 1%-3%. It is worth noting
that this multi-population scenario is very difficult to fit with the data as we
consider a general interaction model and not a selective interaction model,
in the sense that individuals in one region interact with individuals in other
regions by means of θ1 and θ2 . The increase in connectivity due to holidays
and return to school can take big proportions of infections, as it is already
the case in France during late August. We therefore suggest caution to keep
the situation under control.
Finally, on account of the decision of the president of region Campania
to delay the opening of schools in the region, we investigate the impact of

such a scenario. Figure 13 depicts the evolution of system (15) as in Fig. 12
only for the region Campania (purple dotted line), but we have also included
the evolution of cumulative infected in the scenario where schools are opened
with a delay of 1 to 2 weeks by limiting the increase of the parameters ψ1,k
and ψ2,k over mid-September. It is interesting to note that delaying the start
of schools in just one region has a marginal benefit without closing the interregional movements. Indeed, while this lowers the probability of transmission
in Campania from students, people travelling to this region for work from
other regions that do not have the same restrictions have little to no impact
without a national plan. We have also plotted the time evolution of R0 for
this region in the top-right corner: as it can be seen, the value of the basic
reproduction number goes above 1 in September without further restrictions.

Discussion
Our study highlights the relevance of heterogeneous interactions in spreading SARS-CoV-2 while emphasising the threat of asymptomatic individuals
yet not detected and therefore not being isolated. In the asymptomatic
category, our work includes people without any symptoms or for paucisymptomatic. The Istat seroprevalence study for the Italian case guided our datadriven modelling as well as official data from Protezione Civile. We can see
some differences between the model and data when keeping the parameters
of infection constant and updating the connectivity measure only. This provides useful insight on the need to consider where and when to test due to
contact with asymptomatic infected.
In Theorem 1, we carry out the stability analysis of the system, and link
the value of the basic reproduction number R0 to the stability of system in
feedback form. This result allows us to discuss what the requirements are
for the pandemic to end, mostly in relation to effective containment policies
modelled via the measures of interaction. Indeed, an increase of k̄1 and k̄2
would make the value of R0 greater than 1, turning the system unstable for a
potential second wave. Our analysis is refined with the results in Theorem 2,
where we provide the limit values obtained from asymptotic calculations
where the connectivity does not change after t > t0 , for a given t0 > 0.
In the next results, in Theorem 3 we provide an expression for a nonzero
epidemic prevalence, which is another way of defining the total number of
infected at the end of the epidemic. In Theorem 4, we focus on the ratio
between asymptomatic and symptomatic infected and show that this ratio is
asymptotically stable.
To the best of our knowledge, our structured model is the different from
others because we model the heterogeneous interactions in the population
by means of a small world complex network in such a way that we can
determine the interactions of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals
separately. A physical interpretation of Theorem 6 in the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic follows: through a variety of restrictions, local and
national governments limited the number of contacts between individuals
in the population and this can limit the spread of the virus, with the aim
of slowing down the number of people that need intensive care. The issue
with releasing the lockdown can be found in more interactions especially
with people that do not show symptoms (modelled through ψ1,k ). The above
result gives a value of R0 for each class of connectivity for the whole system,
33

which translates to different restrictions in different parts of a given country
to limit the localised outbreaks. The final result, namely Theorem 7, extends
the value of the epidemic threshold in the heterogeneous case with mean hf i
and parameters of connectivity ψ1,k and ψ2,k for each class of connectivity k.
Our case study provides two clear messages. When we use the Istat
seroprevalence study and fit our model with the official data, we can see a
plausible evolution of the number of cumulative infected in the early stages
of the pandemic. The number of asymptomatic is clearly underestimated
in the official data and their role is crucial in that they can undermine the
stability of the system and force another wave. When we look at the regional
level, we agree with other studies that investigated similar scenarios: due to
the nature of the general interaction model that we propose, uncoordinated
control measures between different regions do not provide substantial benefits
to contain the disease, unless the movements across regions in Italy (and
analogously in Europe) are suspended, which is detrimental for workers and
the economy in general.
