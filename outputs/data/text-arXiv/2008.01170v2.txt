Abstract—SARS-CoV2, which causes coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) is continuing to spread globally and has become
a pandemic. People have lost their lives due to the virus and the
lack of counter measures in place. Given the increasing caseload
and uncertainty of spread, there is an urgent need to develop
machine learning techniques to predict the spread of COVID19. Prediction of the spread can allow counter measures and
actions to be implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
In this paper, we propose a deep learning technique, called Deep
Sequential Prediction Model (DSPM) and machine learning based
Non-parametric Regression Model (NRM) to predict the spread
of COVID-19. Our proposed models were trained and tested on
publicly available novel coronavirus 2019 dataset. The proposed
models were evaluated by using Mean Absolute Error and
compared with baseline method. Our experimental results, both
quantitative and qualitative, demonstrate the superior prediction
performance of the proposed models.

I. I NTRODUCTION
COVID-19 is a pandemic that has spread and devastated
countries around the world. Even months on from the original
outbreak of the virus, it still poses a large threat to everyone
around the globe, as with each passing day, the death toll still
increases, and more and more cases are identified. Countries
have been brought to a standstill as citizens are forced to selfisolate and worldwide economies have come to a halt as a
result of the negative impacts on trade and industry.
First discovered in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China,
on the 31st of December 2019, COVID-19 is a respiratory
illness with pneumonia-like qualities and was initially thought
to be caused by human contact with exotic fauna, eventually
resulting in a person-to-person spread. This virus has caused
a massive negative international impact and has affected the
day-to-day lives of millions of people, through bans on large
public gatherings, panic-buying and travel bans.
It is still difficult to predict where and when new cases
will appear, and many governments have failed to understand
the scale and impact of the virus. The exponential spread of
the virus means that until there is a vaccine, or it has been
completely removed from the population, it will always pose
a threat even in locations with the best circumstances.

Deep learning has been a growing trend in data analysis and
predictive modeling in recent years, and has been termed one
of the ten breakthrough technologies [1]. It is emerging as
the leading machine learning tool in computer vision. This
data-driven approach has shown a significant improvement
in the performance of classification for large scale natural
image datasets. For instance, in the 2012 ImageNet LSVRC
contest, the first large-scale deep model, achieved considerably
lower error rates compared to the previous methods. After that,
several deep learning models have been proposed to further
decrease their error rate.
Deep Learning has shown unprecedented performance for
several computer vision tasks. It learns the most predictive
features (learned features) directly from data given a large
dataset of labeled examples. In recent years, deep learning
techniques have emerged as highly effective methods for
prediction and decision-making in a multitude of disciplines
including health (hearing aids), computer vision (e.g., object
and face identification), [2], [3], [4], [5], natural language
processing [6], [7], [8], gesture recognition [9], [10], [11], and
robotics [12].
Inspired by the recent advancement in machine/deep learning, this research hypothesizes that machine learning can be
used to predict the spread of the virus and potentially be used
to help allocate resources and prepare procedures ahead of
time to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, potentially saving
lives. In this paper, we propose two different techniques to
predict the spread of COVID-19. The paper proposes Deep
Sequential Prediction Model (DSPM), which benefits from
the sequential nature of the data to make accurate prediction
about the spread of this disease. The paper also proposes
an efficient Non-parametric Regression Model (NRM), which
avoids computationally expensive parameter learning process
to efficiently predict the spread of COVID-19. The paper
also extensively evaluates the proposed models and analyses
their viability to predict the spread of COVID-19 through
the world’s population. The motivation of this research is to
develop artificial intelligence models, which can accurately
predict the spread of COVID-19, thus allowing more refined
actions and strategies to take place to mitigate, control and
contain the virus. The contributions of this paper can be
summarized as follows:
• The paper proposes a deep sequential prediction model
(DSPM) to learn distinctive features from the input time
series data for accurate prediction of COVID-19 spread

2

The paper also proposes a non-parametric regression
model (NRM) to accurately and efficiently predict the
spread of this contagious disease.
• Extensive evaluation of the proposed models has been
performed on publicly available novel coronavirus
dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed models.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents and discusses the related work. Section 3 presents
our proposed techniques to predict the spread of COVID19. Experimental results are provided in Section 4, which
also provides details of the novel Coronavirus dataset. Section 5 provides discussion and analysis about the proposed
techniques. The paper is concluded in Section 6.

II. L ITERATURE R EVIEW
In this section, we first present relevant deep learning and
machine learning techniques and then discuss the use of
machine learning for infectious diseases. Machine learning
algorithms, which automatically learn features from the input
data, have been evolving over many years and continues to
provide several benefits in all aspects of global life, such as
uses in the medical industry to economics and business. This
has led to the creation of different machine learning models
to help solve problems, such as to predict the spreading of
diseases, in a way that was not possible or was not highly
accurate in the past [13].
Currently, there are several types of machine learning models reported in the literature. For instance, the Decision Tree
model is a predictive model, which breaks up and divides the
input data and makes decisions based on a given variable. This
is continued to be done recursively for each division, creating
a tree like structure, until a solution for the original problem
is produced [14]. Decision trees have been used successfully
for classification and regression tasks in computer vision.
In addition, Neural Networks are also popular machine
learning models. Neural networks mimic a nervous system
(human brain) [15] [16], where neurons connect to each other
to provide an output. A neural network consists of several
layers and data is passed through the input layer to the hidden
layers and then finally to the output layers. The output neuron
with the highest value (also known as weight) decides the
actual class/label of the input data [16].
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the popular
machine learning techniques. This model is designed to split
the given data into two even classes via the creation of a
hyperplane between them. This hyperplane can then be used
to predict the trajectory of future pieces of data. SVM, at
its core, involves creating iteratively and infinitely increasing
multi-dimensional planes until the most optimal separating
hyperplane can be placed between two classes of data points as
evenly as possible [17]. A hyperplane is placed depending on
the support vectors, which are key pieces of data points, that if
altered, change the position of the hyperplane. This is found by
using the decision boundary, which is the margin (or distance)
between the nearest support vectors and the hyperplane. The
SVM finds the most optimal decision boundary by the largest

marginal distance between the plane and the support vectors. If
a hyperplane cannot be found using the dataset on the current
plane, then an extra plane is used and the dataset is checked
again. For example, the SVM attempts to split the dataset into
two dimensions. If no hyperplane is able to be generated, then
the dataset is placed into the three dimensions and checked
again. This process continues until a hyperplane is found [13].
This hyperplane can then be used to further show a predicted
trend beyond the original data given by following the plane
along the axis.
Bayesian Networks have also received popularity due to
their probabilistic predictive nature [18]. These machine learning models involve representing a directed acyclic (noncircular) graph structure, where each node of the graph is a
decision, a piece of data or an event. A node can be connected
to another depending on whether there is a probabilistic
dependency between them. This allows for the prediction on
whether certain events to occur and the probability between
them [5].
Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks have
received attention from the research community because of
their capability to process sequential or time series data. LSTM
were originally designed to deal with the vanishing gradient
problem [19]. LSTM neural nets are improved recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), which allow cells to remember data from
the previous cell through the use of a memory gate. A real
word analogy of a memory gate is like a solenoid valve in
plumbing where the current water pressure dictates how open
the valve is, allowing certain water pressure on its output. The
memory gate (or forget gate) works by checking to see if the
current input data is the same or similar to the current memory
input data and adjusts the memory gates data accordingly. The
memory gates work with either a sigmoid layer or a sigmoid
and tanh layer that outputs a float variable between zero and
one, with zero being do not allow old data through and one
being let all the data through. Throughout the LSTM cell there
are three memory gates that signify the cell’s data state of
whether it’s new data or old data. Traversing through these
three memory gates ends up with the final output for the LSTM
cell.
With the rising issue of the Coronavirus infectious disease
(and other similar diseases such as SARS and MERS), there
have been few studies involving machine learning to predict
the recovery of infected patients and study the similarity of
SARS virus protein with other viruses. John et al., proposed
machine learning techniques to track and analyze the different
factors that are involved in the recovery from MERS [20].
SVM, conditional inference tree, naı̈ve Bayes and J48 models
were used to determine and predict whether the categories,
including gender, age; the patient is a healthcare worker, status
at time of identification of disease, the patient had symptoms
and whether the patient had any pre-existing diseases or conditions, were an important factor in determining the recovery of a
patient from MERS. Their models determined that age, being
a healthcare worker, the status at the time of identification
and whether they had pre-existing disease are good indicators
at predicting the recovery from MERS, with a p-value of
0.001278, 0.001260, 2e-16 and 0.001067, respectively.

3

Cai et al., proposed a method to compare the SARS virus
proteins to those of other viruses, to predict how many of those
proteins are similar with each other [21]. They used an SVM
model in conjunction with the sequence comparison method
BLAST to predict the functional class of a given protein,
such as whether it is a part of the 46 enzyme families, the
21 channel/transporter families or the 5 RNA-binding protein
families to name a few. Their evaluation showed that an SVM
can accurately predict the functional class of 73% of known
coronavirus proteins.
Tang et al., proposed a machine learning technique to
predict the potential animal hosts of the SARS and MERS
viruses [17]. Two machine learning models were used, a
non-linear SVM using a radial kernel and a Mahalanobis
distance (MD) discriminant model, with both using leave-oneout cross-validation of the training data, to determine host
candidates. Both models were successful, with the SVM model
having a 99.86% prediction rate in inferring potential hosts,
while the MD model having a 98.08% prediction rate.
In contrast to the existing techniques, this paper proposes
deep/machine learning techniques to predict the spread of
novel coronavirus COVID-19. The proposed models have been
evaluated on 6.4 million confirmed COVID-19 cases. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first research paper reporting
machine learning models for the prediction of COVID-19
spread.
III. P ROPOSED M ODELS
In this section, we present our proposed prediction models
including Deep Sequential Prediction Model (DSPM) and
Non-parametric Regression Model (NRM).
A. Deep Sequential Prediction Model (DSPM)
Fig. 1 shows the proposed DSPM to predict the spread
of COVID-19. As can be noted, our proposed DSPM is a
stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural network.
DSPM consists of four stacked LSTMs that feed into each
other. These LSTMs contain four hidden layers each (for each
stack) that process the data to yield a highly accurate model.
We chose stacked LSTMs in our proposed models because
the COVID-19 dataset has unknown durations of infection between the countries. This makes training a traditional recurrent
neural network (RNN) difficult. This unknown duration period
can cause RNN to encounter the vanishing gradient problem,
which can completely halt an RNN from further training [22].
On the other hand, a LSTM model is designed to handle this
error. In the following, we discuss the different stages of our
proposed DSPM.
1) Stage 1: Given an input data Xt , this stage (also known
as the forget layer) decides whether the cell will throw away
the previous data or keep it for modification. It makes this
decision through a sigmoid calculation that returns a binary
(either one or zero) value. The sigmoid calculation is based
on the input vector and the output of the previous block and the
memory from the previous block. Therefore, if a new subject
is seen, the cell will want to forget the old subject [23]:
ft = σ (Wf · [Ht−1 , Xt ] + bf )

(1)

Fig. 1. Block diagram of the proposed Deep Sequential Prediction Model
(DSPM)

where Xt is the input vector, Ht−1 is output of the previous
block, bf is a bias term and σ is a nonlinear function.
2) Stage 2: The second stage, also known as the input
gate layer or new memory valve, processes the data from the
previous stage and decides what will be stored in the second
memory gate. It is based on a sigmoid layer and a tanh layer.
The sigmoid layer works the same way as in Stage 1, while
the tanh layer only takes input from the output of the previous
block and the input vector. The tahn layer then outputs to the
memory gate forming new data [23]:
it = σ (Wi · [Ht−1 , Xt ] + bi )

(2)

C̃t = tanh (WC · [Ht−1 , Xt ] + bC )

(3)

3) Stage 3: In Stage 1, the model decides what data it needs
to forget, and in Stage 2 it decides what data it is going to
store. With the previous stages deciding what to do with the
old data, the model now combines the data to form a new data
by combining everything together. To achieve this, it uses the
2 element wise multiplication gates to one summation gate on
the memory pipe, as follows:
Ct = ft ∗ Ct−1 + it ∗ C̃t

(4)

4) Stage 4: In the final stage, the model finally outputs the
data through two channels i.e., the memory channel and the
actual output of the cell. First a sigmoid operation is performed
that decides about the output. Then the processed memory is
put through a tanh nonlinearity. These two operations push
through to an element wise multiplication gate. This action
is the final output of the cell data. The processed memory
then continues onto its own output untouched by this final
calculation, while the data output continues after processing
[23]:
ot = σ (Wo [Ht−1 , xt ] + bo )
(5)
Ht = ot ∗ tanh (Ct )

(6)

DSPM Training and Testing To train the proposed DSPM,
the data that is inputted into the model is first cleaned up from

4

the available time series data. The data is split between country
and provinces, and the time series data is then converted to a
data frame that includes a date of the confirmed cases. Using
empirically selected scalar threshold, this data frame is then
converted to 0s and 1s and inputted into the DSPM for its
training. DSPM training was found to be faster as the input
values are smaller to process. During testing, the model is
presented with unseen examples and eventually it outputs its
prediction, which are then inverted back to whole numbers via
its original scalar threshold.
B. Proposed Non-Parametric Regression Model (NRM)
In this section, we discuss our proposed non-parametric
regression model (NRM). The NRM is based on an additive
regression time-series algorithm and uses a decomposable time
series model with three major components i.e.,
y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + t

(7)

where g(t) is either linear or a logistic growth curve trend,
s(t) are periodic changes, h(t) captures irregular effects, and
t represents errors created by unusual changes that are not
supported by the model.
There are two trend models for g(t). These include a saturating growth model and a piecewise linear model. A saturating
growth model typically handles non-linear prediction, which
meets our requirement. In the proposed NRM, we therefore use
the saturating growth model for predicting the spread of the
virus. The saturating growth model is represented as follows:
g(t) =

C
1 + exp(−k(t − m))

(8)

where C is the carrying capacity; k is the growth rate and
m is the offset parameter. However, the growth rate is not
constant, and therefore NRM incorporate trend changes in the
growth model by defining change points where the growth
rate can change. This is done by defining a vector of rate
adjustments as follows [30] [31]:
δ ∈ RS

(9)

where S represents change points at times and can be seen
as sj , j = 1,. . . , S; δj is the change in rate that occurs at sj
[31].
When the rate at time t is equal to k + a(t)T δ. Then k
is adjusted, the offset parameter m must also be adjusted
to connect endpoints of segments. When there is a correct
adjustment γj at change point j, it can be computed as [31]:


!
P
X
k + l<j δl
P
γj = sj − m −
γl  1 −
(10)
k + l≤j δl
l<j

Finally, the model for logistic growth is given by the
following equation:
g(t) =

IV. E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS
We extensively evaluated the performance of the proposed
models on the publicly available novel coronavirus (COVID19) dataset. In this section, we first provide the details of the
dataset and then present our experimental results.

A. Novel Coronavirus 2019 Dataset
We used publicly available novel Coronavirus 2019 dataset
[24], [25], which is available via Kaggle and Github, respectively. The dataset contains globally reported confirmed
COVID-19 cases in the following format:
ObservationDate - Date of the observation in
MM/DD/YYYY
Province/State - Province or state of the observation
Country/Region - Country of observation
Last Update - Time in UTC at which the row is updated
for the given province or country.
Confirmed - Cumulative number of confirmed cases till that
date
Deaths - Cumulative number of of deaths till that date
Recovered - Cumulative number of recovered cases till that
date
In the dataset, there are 133 dates that are represented as
time series points, and each time series point includes the
number of confirmed COVID-19 cases on that date. There
are 266 countries that are split up into provinces that have
data for those 133 dates. There is also other data that includes
recovery cases, and death cases that follow the same format as
the confirmed cases. Our proposed models have been evaluated
on 6.4 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, which have been
reported from 22nd January to 5th May 2020.

B. Data Preprocessing
The data fed to each model is divided into country and
state/province level and stored in objects to allow easy access
to country predictions and error rates. Some of the predictions
are in decimal value. All these prediction values are rounded
to the nearest whole number to represent the actual number
of infected people.

C. Metric for Evaluation
Prediction values are compared to real cases by using Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), which is a loss function mostly used
for regression models. MAE is a metric that is used to compare
both predicted value and the actual value. MAE is measured
for each prediction, before the prediction values are rounded
for computing an accurate error rate.

C(t)
(11)
1 + exp (− (k + a(t)> δ) (t − (m + a(t)> γ)))

The proposed NRM was trained and tested in the same way
as the DSPM, however, without using scalars for data input
vectors.

D. Prediction Results
In this section, we present the prediction results for the
proposed models and comparison with the baseline model.

TABLE IV
P REDICTION OF C ONFIRMED CASES BY OUR PROPOSED MODELS AND THE BASELINE APPROACH .

E. Baseline Method and Results
We use the popular Support Vector Machine (SVM) as our
baseline method (called Model1 in our experiments) to predict
and analyze the spread of coronavirus in different locations
for a variety of reasons. One of the main reasons for choosing
SVM was its ease of implementation. Using different Python
algorithms allows for easy splitting of the data into training
dataset and a test dataset, as well as the actual modelling
of the dataset. Next, the model is good for showing and
modelling linear and nonlinear (exponential) regression [9],

meaning that it is able to model output variables that are real
and/or continuous values, for example such as predicting the
average age of a person [9], or in the case of this paper,
predicting the spread of a coronavirus in a certain location.
Lastly it is usually efficient, as it uses a subset of the data
given as training data from the decision function, meaning
that it is quick and memory efficient on smaller data sets.
Table 1 to 4 (Column 4) report the SVM predictions
formatted to be time-series data. Table 5 reports the average
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for the baseline model. As can

be noted, the average MAE is really high compared to the
total cases analyzed. Fig. 2 shows prediction results for the
baseline model. Fig. 2 (first column and row) shown the
country (Bangladesh) that has the highest MAE out of all
countries that were analyzed by this model. It can be noted
that this odel was not able to accurately predict COVID-19
cases for this country. A similar trend was observed for other
countries that have a large number of confirmed corona virus
cases. Fig.2 also shows countries with countries with better
prediction results. Fig. 5 (left columns) shows the country that
has the lowest MAE out of all countries that were analyzed.
Low MAEs are usually found within countries that have the
lowest number of confirmed cases. This can be seen in Fig. 5
for two different models, which have the lowest MAE for this
country. It can be generalized that this model has a high failure
rate when a country has large amount of cases to analyze.
Table 5 reports the average MAE and error rate that can be
expected as error estimate when the model predicts COVID-19
cases for a given country/region. Additional prediction results
for this model have been provided in Fig. 6.
F. DSPM Results
Table 1 to 4 (Column 5) report the predictions results for
the proposed DPSM that are formatted to be time-series data.
Table 5 reports the prediction results for our proposed DSPM
(called Model2 in our experiments). The average MAE for this
model is 388.43, which is very low compared to the baseline
model. The error rate for this model is 1.62%. Fig. 3 shows
the prediction results for the proposed DPSM. For this model,
most countries and provinces with the lowest MAEs include

countries and provinces that generally have lower cases of the
virus (Fig. 3 and Table 1-4). Additional prediction results for
this model have been provided in Fig. 7.
G. NRM Results
Table 1 to 4 (Column 6) reports the prediction results for
our proposed NRM (called Model 3 in our experiments). The
average MAE for this model is 142.23 (Table 5), which is low
compared to the baseline method and DPSM. The error rate for
the proposed NRM is only 0.6%. Fig. 4 shows the prediction
results (randomly selected for demonstration) for this model.
As can be noted this model achieves the best prediction results.
The last row of Fig. 4 shows the countries and provinces that
have the lowest error (calculated from MAE) in their continent.
NRM outperforms the baseline model and DPSM. Additional
prediction results for this model have been provided in Fig. 8.
V. D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS
Table V reports average MAE for the baseline method and
our proposed techniques. High MAEs generally do not always
mean bad predictions. For instance in Fig. 4 (Brazil, first row
and first column), there were 555383 confirmed cases analyzed
in Brazil and having only a MAE error of 5472 basically
means out of all the confirmed cases, 5472 individuals were
predicted incorrectly. This means that there was only a 0.98%
error for the entire data for Brazil and overall this is a good
prediction. High MAEs can be classified as a bad error rate
for the model predictions when the error rate is over 10% out
of all confirmed cases for a country and province as seen in
Fig. 2 (Bangladesh, first row and first column) for baseline
methos (Model1). The MAE for this case is 522297.28 out
of 1.83 million confirmed cases. The error in this case is
28.51%. We observed that countries that have a small number
of confirmed cases, generally have lower MAEs because there
are not enough confirmed cases, thus models will have a
limited range of cases that it can predict. This can be seen in
Fig.5 (for Lesotho), which shows different predictions for each

model and both have low MAEs. Similar results are prevalent
in other countries with small numbers of confirmed cases.
Note that baseline model (Model1) has an error rate of
27%, the proposed DPSM has an error rate of 1.62% and
the proposed NRM has an error rate of 0.6%. Baseline model
was not efficient enough compared to DPSM and NRM. In
addition, proposed NRM performed better than the proposed
DPSM, however, the difference in performance is not large.
Both models can be used to model prediction for COVID-19
i.e., predict the number of people that can get infected by this
disease. However, the models were only tested on the number
of people being infected by Coronavirus and confirmed, it
does not consider other factors such as recoveries, deaths, and
restrictions being implemented that reduce the chances for a
person contracting COVID-19. However, this does not limit
the predictions that the models will make as they will follow
trends that are continuously being updated within the provided
COVID-19 dataset.
VI. C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK
In this paper, deep/machine learning models have been
developed with the purpose of accurately predicting the spread
of COVID-19. These models include DPSM and NRM. The
proposed models were trained and tested as predictive models
for the spread of COVID-19. As can be noted, our proposed
models were successful on predicting the spread of COVID19 with low error rates. NRM was deemed the most accurate
model to be used to predict the spread of the virus due to its
low MAE and error rate (0.6%), however the DPSM model
was close to performing on the same level as NRM without
any issues as it had lower overall error rates compared to cases
per specific country and province. It can be concluded that the
proposed DPSM and the NRM models have the potential to
predict the spread of the virus in the future. However, the
baseline model may have to be tweaked to fit time series
data more efficiently and predict the spread with an overall
lower MAE. COVID-19 was a virus that the world was poorly
prepared for. The use of machine learning techniques as tools
to predict the spread of the virus would allow for greater
levels of preparedness through better resource management
and distribution based on the prediction made by the models.
These models can help prevent more waves of COVID-19
from occurring or even provide groundwork for the creation
of similar predictive models for future strains of viruses.
In our future work, we intend to fuse DPSM and NRM
features to refine the prediction of the proposed models. We
would also train our model on additional data (as the publicly
available dataset is being regularly updated) to further improve
the prediction of the spread of COVID-19.
