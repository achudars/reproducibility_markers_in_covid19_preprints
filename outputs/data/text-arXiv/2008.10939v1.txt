Abstract- In this paper, the authors aim to find out the origin of the corona and the
duration of the present pandemic caused by it. Besides, they aim to find out the reason for
such outbreaks occurring often in China. They make a hypothesis that the origin of the
virus is embedded in the solar cycle. Next, they have proved the hypothesis by investigating
the sunspot number, the cosmic ray flux data, the concentration of

10

Be in the ice core in

Greenland and based on the occurrence of past pandemics and endemics. The study shows
that whenever the Sun is in the magnetically quiescent state, the world witnesses viral
diseases. The study shows that the outbreak of the Corona is because of the minimum
sunspot number during 2019-2020 and the Corona is likely to stay in the whole of 2020.
The study indicates the occurrence of viral diseases in every 11-13 years. It also reveals that
as the stratospheric thickness is the minimum at Wuhan, the virus had chosen this place as
the first entry point to the Earth.

Keywords: Sunspot number, cosmic ray flux, stratosphere, solar cycle.

Introduction
The world is kneeling under the grip of the pandemic caused by the Corona, a virus that had first
erupted in China. All over the globe, many people have been infected by the deadly virus. The
governments of all countries are trying to find out the cause of the occurrence of Corona and
have initiated several safety measures. However, the number of infected people and the death
toll continue to rise. In this paper, the authors have attempted to find out the cause of the
outbreak. The very fact that the Sun is in the magnetically quiescent state in 2019- 2020 and the
Corona outbreak is creating havoc since 2019, it had appeared to the corresponding author that
the secret of the outbreak of the virus is embedded in the solar cycle. Thus, it is purely the
author’s hypothesis. To find out the cause of the Corona outbreak, in this paper, the authors have
investigated the solar cycle from 1700-2019. Besides, they have investigated the cosmic ray flux
data over Oulu, Finland, and Ahmedabad, India. Further, they have analyzed the concentration
of

10

Be collected in the ice core in Greenland. The authors have attempted, in particular, to find

out when the Corona is likely to disappear, and when the next outbreak of viral disease will
happen. Besides, they further aim to find out why the Corona has shown its first appearance in
China.
The Sun is the major driving force of the atmospheric processes. Sir William Herschel
suggested a possible influence of the solar cycle on the Earth’s atmosphere1. Several studies2-4
have revealed the influence of the solar cycle on Earth. Studies show that the humidity5 and
temperature are strongly correlated to the sunspot number. Loon and Meehl6 noticed that during
the solar maxima, the sea surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean shows a pattern conducive to
La Nina. The total solar irradiance (TSI), i.e. the incoming solar radiation at the top of the
atmosphere, and the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface cause weather and
3

climate on the Earth. The amount of radiation reaching a particular place on Earth is also
governed by the Earth’s orbital motion and its spin7. Thus, any changes in the atmospheric
processes on the Earth depend on the modulations in solar radiation and the orbital and spinning
motion of the Earth. Besides, the cosmic rays of galactic and solar origin also affect the
atmospheric processes8. A Study5 shows that the humidity at a place depends on the cosmic rays.
The cosmic ray flux at a place shows strong correlations with the temperature over Oulu,
Finland.
The total solar irradiance (TSI) depends on the magnetic activity of the Sun. It is found out
that when the Sun is in the active state, then the TSI is higher3 than when it is magnetically
quiescent9. The sunspot number (SSN) is a manifestation of the level of activity of the Sun.
When the Sun is magnetically active, then the SSN is high10. At this time, solar winds and solar
flares are strong. Then, the cosmic rays, which are the high-energy protons and atomic nuclei11
coming from the Sun and outside of the solar system, cannot penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere as
the strong magnetic field around the Sun reflects them into space. The Sun shows a periodicity in
its cycle. Hathaway12 has shown that SSN maxima occur after 11 years. When the Sun is
magnetically quiescent, then the SSN is less10. At this time, the weak magnetic field around the
Sun cannot shield the Earth from the high –energy cosmic rays13. It is because the energy of the
cosmic rays is higher than the geomagnetic cut-off of the Earth. Then, the cosmic rays enter the
Earth’s atmosphere. The measured intensity of cosmic rays shows high during the magnetically
quiescent state of the Sun14. The cosmic rays, which are primarily Hydrogen by 89%, Helium by
10% percent and all other elements by 1%15, penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere with the velocity
of light. After reaching the Earth’s atmosphere, the cosmic rays collide with the atoms of the
Earth’s upper atmosphere to produce secondary particles, viz. ,

4

14

C and

10

Be16. The interaction

of cosmic rays with the atmosphere produces ionization. The secondary particles produced
during the ionization process by the interaction of the primary cosmic rays with the atoms
present in the lower atmosphere form the ultra-fine aerosols. The aerosols act as cloud
condensation nuclei. Thus, the cosmic rays affect the formation of clouds and rain.
Observations17,18 show that when the cosmic ray flux reaching the Earth decreases, the
cloudiness and precipitation also decreases. The secondary particles further interact with the air
molecules producing other particles, that shower towards the Earth’s surface.
Apart from their impact on the Earth’s climate, the cosmic rays have demonstrated the
capability of inducing mutation in the viruses19. Mutations, i.e. the changes of the DNA
replication process may be caused by several agents, of which the muons are the dominant
components. Muons are produced by high energy cosmic rays20 in the Earth's atmosphere, at an
altitude of 15 km where high energy cosmic rays interact with the nuclei of atmospheric gases.
These particles, due to their low interaction cross-section21, travel towards the Earth with a
velocity close to that of light. The muons penetrate deep underground and underwater, with the
possibility of affecting biological entities21. A study by Ferrari and Szuszkiewicz8 opines that the
ionization caused by the cosmic rays might have caused the evolution of life on Earth. Rieseberg
and Livingstone19 have shown that the cosmic rays can change the chromosome in a reproductive
cell. Mukherjee22 opines that the cosmic rays may either induce mutation in the viruses already
present in the air or the body of the human being. A study by Mukherjee22 has shown that a
heavy shower of cosmic ray flux, along with the sudden fall of electron flux during the last week
of February 2009 to the first week of March 2009 was followed by the H1N1 outbreak in
Mexico. Mukherjee22 has reported continuous low electron flux before the outbreak of the
disease. Between March and August of 2009, millions of people around the world were infected

5

with influenza and respiratory failure22. Thus, the cosmic rays demonstrate to have the potential
to cause mutation in living organisms. The research of Hope-Simpson23 exhibits that the SSN
cycle correlates with influenza pandemics. The influenza virus mutated to a different variety with
the successive sunspot cycle23.
In this paper, the authors aim to seek the reason for the Corona outbreak. By assuming that the
origin of the virus lies in the mystery of the solar cycle, they have examined the correlation
between the outbreak of viral diseases worldwide, and the sunspot number. The investigation is
further complimented with the cosmic ray flux data and the production of

10

Be over several

years.

Materials and methods
The investigation carried out in this paper is based on sunspot number data obtained from the
Solar Influences Data Analysis Centre (SIDC), Royal Observatory of Belgium for the period
1700-202024. The year of the outbreak of viral diseases has been obtained from the list of
epidemics

25

. The cosmic ray flux data over Oulu have been obtained from the Cosmic Ray

Station, Sodankyla Geophysical Observatory, the University of Oulu for the period 1964-201826.
The cosmic ray flux data over Ahmedabad during 1957-1958; 1964; and 1968-1973 have been
obtained from the World Data Centre for Cosmic Ray, Physical Research Laboratory,
Ahmedabad27. The data on

10

Be are obtained from the NOAA National Centre for

Environmental Information for the period 1700-199428.
In this paper, the time series of SSN, cosmic ray flux, and

10

Be have been investigated. The

simultaneous time series of any two parameters have been investigated for the period over which
data for both the parameters are available. The analysis is based on the occurrence of the crests
6

and troughs of the parameters. The correlation between the SSN and the cosmic ray flux over
Oulu and Ahmedabad is based on a curve estimation technique using different models, viz.
linear, power, logarithmic, logistics, inverse, inverse, cubic, compound, exponential, growth,
quadratic, and sigmoid. The validity of the models is judged by the F test at a 5% level of
significance.

Results and discussion
In an attempt to find out whether the outbreak of viral diseases always coincided or followed the
low sunspot number, the occurrence of the two has been investigated during 1700-2020 (Table
1). Table 1 shows that the sunspot minima in the 11-13 year solar cycle have always brought
viral diseases across the globe. For example, in 2009, the outbreak of swine flu worldwide
followed the sunspot low in 2008. In 2009, the sunspot minimum was observed. The worldwide
outbreak of plague in 1856-1860 was associated with a sunspot maximum in 1856. Table 1
further shows that at times, the outbreak of diseases also coincided with the sunspot maxima. For
example, the outbreak of measles in 1788 was associated with the sunspot maxima in the same
year. The outbreak of influenza worldwide in 1847- 1848 had seen the sunspot maximum in
1848.
Thus, a very low or a sunspot minimum is of concern as it is likely to cause an outbreak of
viral diseases. The governments of all countries should be equipped with proper mitigation
techniques after ever 11-13 years.
Figure 1 shows the variation of SSN during 1700- 2019, and

10

Be for 1700-1994. Figure 1

shows that the SSN maxima and minima occur after a fixed interval. The maxima occur after
11.3 years and the minima occur after 11-13 years.
7

It is found out in Figure 1 that the

10

Be shows its high after 2-9 years. The

occurs after every 2-9 years. However, the minima of
1980 and 1990. The values of

10

10

10

Be low also

Be had occurred in 1872, 1939, 1958,

Be in these years were 0.992, 0.931, 0.994, 0.956, and 0.851,

respectively. Figure 1 further shows that the SSN minima are associated with
the same year. At times, the

10

10

Be maxima in

Be maxima followed in the immediate next year when the SSN

minima had occurred. For example, in 1700, 1711, 1766, 1784, 1798, 1810, 1823, 1878, 1923,
1933, 1944, the SSN minima and the

10

Be peak had occurred. The

10

Be peaks in 1734, 1756,

1776, 1857, 1890, 1914, 1965, and 1977 had followed the SSN troughs in the immediately
previous years, implying that high 10Be concentration are associated with SSN minima or a very
low SSN, i.e. during the magnetically quiescent state of the Sun. Sakurai et al.29 also found
anticorrelation between the sunspot number and the Be-7 concentration. However, it is
noteworthy that rarely deviations are observed between the occurrence of the SSN troughs and
10

Be peaks. For example, a 10Be peak was observed in 1842, but the SSN trough had happened in

1843. Besides, in 1986 the SSN trough was observed, and the

10

Be was observed in 1988 and

1985. Also, in 1957, the 10Be peak coincided with the SSN peak.
Figure 2 a and b respectively shows the variation of sunspot number and cosmic ray flux over
Oulu, Finland, and Ahmedabad, India. Figure 2 a shows that the SSN and cosmic ray flux
maintain inverse relation over Olulu, i.e. the troughs of SSN time series fall on the crests of
cosmic ray flux, and vice versa. At times, the cosmic ray flux maxima occur in the same year as
the SSN minima. For example, in 1976 the maximum cosmic ray flux was associated with the
minimum SSN. In 2000 and 2014, the SSN maxima coincided with the minimum cosmic ray
flux. At times, the cosmic ray maxima followed the SSN minima. For example, the cosmic ray
maxima of 1965, 1969, 1987, 1997, and 2009 respectively followed the SSN minima of 1964,

8

1968, 1986, 1996, and 2008. At times, the cosmic ray maxima follow the SSN maxima after two
to three years. The cosmic ray maxima of 1982 and 1991 followed the SSN minima in 1979 and
1989, respectively. Figure 2 b shows that the SSN trough in 1973 coincided with the peak cosmic
ray flux. Utomo30 has shown that as the SSN increases, the cosmic ray flux decreases.
To find out the correlation between the SSN and cosmic ray flux, the authors have fitted the
yearly SSN and cosmic ray flux data over Oulu and Ahmedabad to various models, viz. linear,
power, logarithmic, logistic, inverse, cubic, quadratic, inverse, sigmoid, growth, exponential, and
logistic. The validity of the models is judged by the F test at a 5% level of significance. The
results of the investigation are described in Figure 3 a and b, respectively over Oulu and
Ahmedabad. Figure 3 a and b shows that the SSN and cosmic ray flux bear a very significant
relationship with an R2 value of 0.747 over Oulu and 0.952 over Ahmedabad. The relationship
over Oulu is found to be a quadratic one (Figure 3 a), while over Ahmedabad, a cubic relation
(Figure 3 b) suits. Thus, Figure 3 a and b show that in the data-sparse regions, the cosmic ray
flux can very well be estimated from the measured values of the SSN. However, the relationships
are to be established using the data of cosmic ray flux and over a location and the SSN. Besides,
the relationship is likely to vary from one location to another, depending on the latitude of the
location.
Figure 4 a and b respectively represents the variations of cosmic ray flux and

10

Be over Oulu

Finland during 1964-1994 and Ahmedabad, India during 1968-1973. Figure 4 a shows that over
Oulu, in 1965, both the cosmic ray flux and 10Be had attained the peak value. Similarly, in 1990
the minimum value of both cosmic rays and 10Be had happened. The 10Be maxima in 1977, and
1988 followed the cosmic ray maxima in 1976 and 1987, respectively. The cosmic ray minima in

9

1969, 1974, and 1982 were followed by the minima of

10

Be in 1970, 1975, and 1984,

respectively. In 1990, the minimum values of cosmic ray flux and 10Be had coincided.
However, some anomalies are observed in the occurrence of the crests and troughs of cosmic
ray and 10Be time series. For example, in 1972, the peak 10Be was observed. The peak cosmic ray
flux had occurred in 1973. Figure 4 b shows that the peak cosmic ray flux over Ahmedabad in
1973 was associated with a very high value of

10

Be. However, the peak

10

Be had occurred in

1972- one year before the cosmic ray peak had happened.
Thus, it appears that an increase in cosmic ray flux increases the production of

10

Be. This

further implies that when the Sun is in the magnetically quiescent state, marked by SSN minima,
a large amount of cosmic ray flux penetrates the Earth’s atmosphere and a large amount of 10Be
deposit is observed. During 1690- 1700, the sunspot number was minimum. During this period,
the

10

Be showed the largest peak31, implying that the cosmic ray flux reaching the Earth was

high.
To find out the possibility of occurrence of the Corona to occur in 2019-2020, and to
investigate the time duration of the existence of the same, the authors wish to find out the recent
20-year trend of the variations of SSN and cosmic ray flux during 1964- 2018. The period 19642018 has been chosen as both SSN and cosmic ray flux data are available for this period. Figure
5 a and b respectively shows the variations of SSN and cosmic ray flux over Oulu during 19791998 and 1999-2018. Figure 5 a and b shows that in the recent 20-year periods, the SSN shows a
decreasing trend, while the cosmic ray flux shows an increasing trend. The investigation further
shows that in each 10-year slot during 1964-2018, both showed the opposite trends (results not
shown). Besides, in every slot, the crest of one superimposes on the trough of the other (results
not shown).

10

Thus, Figure 5 a and b show that the SSN has a decreasing trend, while the cosmic ray flux
has an increasing trend in recent years. It implies that the chance of occurrence of viral diseases
in very high in the year 2019-2020. Table 1 also shows that the SSN minima are always
associated with the outbreak of viral diseases.
The next question the authors wish to address is that for how long the Corona will keep
creating havoc. For this purpose, the authors have investigated the monthly trends of the SSN in
the recent 10-year slot, i.e. during 2010-2019. The investigation shows that in every month
during 2000-2019, the SSN shows a decreasing trend. The results of February, March, and April
are respectively shown in Figure 6 a-c. Results for other months are not shown. Thus, the study
shows that every month in 2020 will show the SSN low in the current solar cycle. Thus, the
authors conclude that the Corona will be present on the Earth during the whole of 2020. Figure 7
shows the monthly mean SSN from January 2019- February 2020. Figure 7 reveals that there is a
decreasing trend in SSN in this period. Thus, the SSN is likely to decrease further in the coming
months from March- December 2020. The situation may improve most probably in 2021, or
2022 when the SSN will gradually increase. The Earth will again witness an attack of a virus,
maybe a new one with a different mutation in its DNA different from the Corona, flu, cholera or
whatever.
Now the question is why the outbreaks originate often in China. The reason is that the
thickness of the stratosphere is very low over China. The height of the tropopause in the deep
equatorial region starts at about 17.3 km and near 30 degrees in the northern and southern
hemisphere, it comes down at 17.1 km32. In the northern polar region between 60N-90N, it
comes down at about 10.5 km, while in the southern polar region it comes farther down to 9.7
km32. The height of the stratopause is about 50.0 km in the tropical region. Near 30 degrees both

11

in the northern and the southern hemisphere, the height of the stratopause is the lowest-at about
47.0-48.0 km. In the southern polar latitudes, the stratopause reaches an altitude of 50.0 km,
while at the northern polar latitudes, it reaches as high as 55.0 km. Thus, it is realized that the
thickness of the stratosphere is the minimum (about 29.9-30.9 km) near 30 degrees North and
South. The thickness of the stratopause is about 32.7 km in the tropical region. At the north pole
it is about 44.5 km thick, while at the South pole, it is about 40.3 km thick. Because the
stratospheric thickness is the minimum near 30N and 30S, it is easy for the cosmic ray and other
electrically charged viruses20 to enter the Earth at these latitudes. Wuhan, China lies at 30.59N.
Thus, the first entry of the Corona via Wuhan is scientifically reasonable. Many of the viral
outbreaks had first occurred in China as the stratospheric thickness is the minimum there20.

Conclusion
The results of the study indicate that whenever the Sun will reach the most quiescent state, as
marked by the minimum sunspot number, outbreaks of viral diseases will happen in the world.
Thus, the authors would like to draw the attention of the governments of all countries, the
policymakers, the astrobiologists, and the virologists to adopt necessary mitigation techniques
against the unforeseen natural calamities. As the SSN minima occur after every 11-13 years, the
outbreak of viral diseases is also likely to recur after every 11-13 years. So, the authors wish to
state that the next catastrophic viral attack will occur again anytime in 2030-2032. The study also
indicates that places near 30N and 30S are the entry points of cosmic rays to the Earth, implying
that the viral outbreaks are likely to occur at first near these latitudes.

12

Finally, the authors conclude that the outbreak of viral diseases is a natural calamity. Probably
the human race cannot stop the entry or generation of viruses. What they can do is to adopt
mitigation techniques to reduce casualties.

Conflict of interest: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.
