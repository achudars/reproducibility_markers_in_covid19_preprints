The outbreak of COVID-19 led to a record-breaking race to develop a vaccine. However, the limited vaccine

capacity creates another massive challenge: how to distribute vaccines to mitigate the near-end impact of the
pandemic? In the United States in particular, the new Biden administration is launching mass vaccination
sites across the country, raising the obvious question of where to locate these clinics to maximize the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign. This paper tackles this question with a novel data-driven approach to
optimize COVID-19 vaccine distribution. We first augment a state-of-the-art epidemiological model, called
DELPHI, to capture the effects of vaccinations and the variability in mortality rates across age groups. We
then integrate this predictive model into a prescriptive model to optimize the location of vaccination sites
and subsequent vaccine allocation. The model is formulated as a bilinear, non-convex optimization model.
To solve it, we propose a coordinate descent algorithm that iterates between optimizing vaccine distribution
and simulating the dynamics of the pandemic. As compared to benchmarks based on demographic and epidemiological information, the proposed optimization approach increases the effectiveness of the vaccination
campaign by an estimated 20%, saving an extra 4,000 extra lives in the United States over a three-month
period. The proposed solution achieves critical fairness objectives—by reducing the death toll of the pandemic in several states without hurting others—and is highly robust to uncertainties and forecast errors—by
achieving similar benefits under a vast range of perturbations.

Introduction

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has started a global race to develop vaccines, fueled
by extensive investments, governmental support, and scientific breakthroughs. Thanks to these
unprecedented efforts, the scientific community delivered the good news that the whole world was
eagerly awaiting. By Summer 2020, several vaccines had been developed. By the end of 2020,
several vaccines got approved for emergency use and hundreds more were going under development
and testing. Whereas vaccine development used to take years and even decades, these results rank,
with no doubt, among the greatest scientific achievements (Lurie et al. 2020, Graham 2020).
Unfortunately, discovering and developing a vaccine for COVID-19 was just the beginning—it
will now take months to produce, distribute, and deliver vaccines at scale. The world has quickly
come to the realization that vaccines cannot be made available immediately to everyone, and
policy makers need to make tough decisions to pilot vaccine distribution. A global consensus has
naturally emerged to prioritize to healthcare workers, other front line workers, and vulnerable

populations such as older people and people with comorbidities (see, e.g., National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2020). Within these general principles, each jurisdiction is
designing more detailed eligibility guidelines to distribute vaccines effectively and equitably within
a population, based on demographic, clinical and geographic factors. However, a question remains
open: how to plan vaccine distribution across populations, that is, how to allocate a limited vaccine
supply across communities, across provinces, and even across countries?
In the United States, this question gained prominence in the midst of a presidential transition.
In particular, the new Biden administration relies on higher extents of federal coordination in
vaccine distribution, as opposed to a more decentralized approach at the state level. In one of its
first major decisions, the administration started opening mass vaccination sites, with many more
planned over the next few weeks.1 This environment raises the critical question of where to locate
these vaccination sites. Obviously, these decisions need to adhere to a number of political and
fairness considerations—most notably, there must be at least one site per state. Yet, there remains
flexibility to use mass vaccination sites as a strategic lever to effectively combat the pandemic.
This paper addresses this question with a novel data-driven approach, combining epidemiological
modeling and prescriptive analytics, to optimize the location of vaccination sites and the subsequent
allocation of vaccines. To this end, we leverage a recent compartmental epidemiological model
called DELPHI (Differential Equations Lead to Predictions of Hospitalizations and Infections),
which extends Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) models to capture critical drivers of
the COVID-19 pandemic: (i) under-detection due to limited testing, (ii) governmental and societal
response, and (iii) declining mortality rates (Li et al. 2020). The DELPHI model has been fitted
from historical data at the country level, at the state level in the United States, and at the province
level in a few other countries. The DELPHI forecasts have been incorporated into the ensemble
forecast from the US Center for Disease Control (2020a) and have been utilized in selecting the
Phase III trial locations for the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Historically, the DELPHI
model has featured excellent predictive performance, matching the number of detected cases and
deaths with high accuracy across the various waves of the pandemic.
In this paper, we integrate the (predictive) DELPHI model into a (prescriptive) optimization
model for vaccine allocation. We first propose an extension of DELPHI, referred to as DELPHI–V,
to capture the effects of vaccinations on the dynamics of the pandemic. The DELPHI–V model
also disaggregates the dynamics of the pandemic at the subpopulation level to reflect disparities
in mortality rates across age groups, which are critical drivers of vaccination strategies. We then
formulate an optimization model, referred to as DELPHI–V–OPT, which optimizes the vaccine

distribution strategy (that is, the deployment of mass vaccination sites at the strategic level, and the
subsequent allocation of vaccines at the tactical level) to minimize the death toll of the pandemic.
From a technical standpoint, the DELPHI–V–OPT model relies on time discretization to embed
the system of ordinary differential equations governing the DELPHI–V dynamics into an optimization model. The model is formulated as a bilinear (non-convex) optimization model, due to
the SEIR dynamics at the core of DELPHI–V in which the number of new cases is driven by the
number of susceptible and infected people. To solve it efficiently in realistic large-scale settings, we
propose a coordinate descent algorithm. Starting from a baseline solution, the algorithm iterates,
until convergence, between optimizing the vaccine distribution strategy (for given dynamics of the
pandemic) and simulating the dynamics of the pandemic (for a given vaccine distribution strategy).
We implement the proposed model and algorithm using real-world data in the United States
from the New York Times (2020), the US Census Bureau (2020), and the US Center for Disease
Control (2021). We leverage the parameter estimates from the DELPHI model in each US state.
One challenge, however, is that DELPHI estimates mortality rates in each state in each time period,
while the US Center for Disease Control (2021) reports mortality rates in each age bracket. To
develop realistic and consistent estimates for mortality rates in each state, each age group and each
time period, we formulate another bilinear optimization model that interpolates these two pieces
of information, while ensuring consistency with broader demographic information.
Results suggest that the locations of vaccination sites can have a massive impact on the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign. As compared to several benchmarks based on demographic
information (e.g., city and state population) and epidemiological information (e.g., case counts),
our optimization approach increases the number of lives saved by the vaccines by 20%, or 4,000 lives
over a three-month period in the United States. These results underscore the necessity to consider
both demographics and epidemiological dynamics when determining the locations of vaccination
sites and subsequent vaccine allocation, which is achieved by the combination of our DELPHI–V
epidemiological model and our optimization framework. In addition, the optimization approach
can ensure equity between states and across vaccination sites, thus alleviating the death toll of
the pandemic in some states without hurting others. Finally, these benefits are highly robust to
misspecifications and fluctuations in the DELPHI parameters. Practically speaking, even though
tactical decisions (e.g., vaccine allocation) need to be revised continuously in response to the latest
information available throughout the vaccination campaign, strategic decisions (i.e., the location
of vaccination sites) are highly robust to noise and uncertainty.
In summary, this paper makes three contributions. From a modeling standpoint, it formulates a
novel optimization model for vaccine allocation, DELPHI–V–OPT, that integrates a state-of-theart epidemiological model into an optimization model that supports vaccine distribution strategies,

in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. From a computational standpoint, it develops a
scalable coordinate descent algorithm, which converges effectively and in short runtimes. From a
practical standpoint, it demonstrates that optimizing the locations of mass vaccination sites can
curb the death toll of COVID-19 by a sizeable amount, thus highlighting the critical role of vaccine
distribution besides vaccine design and vaccine production in combating the pandemic. Obviously,
vaccine distribution involves broad political, economic and social considerations, which lie beyond
the scope of this paper; yet, this paper can play a critical role to support ongoing mass vaccination
efforts in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on public health.

Literature review

Many pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions have explored different technologies
toward a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Shin et al. 2020, Florindo et al. 2020). These span (i) inactivated or
live-attenuated virus vaccines, which induce an immune response from weakened or killed pathogens
(used by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, for instance); (ii) viral vector vaccines, which
exploit non-replicating adenoviruses to deliver an antigenic element (used by Johnson and Johnson,
for instance); (iii) subunit vaccines, which use a minimal structural component of a pathogen such
as a protein (used by Clover Biopharmaceuticals, for instance); (iv) nucleic acid vaccines, which
deliver DNA or mRNA of viral proteins (used by Pfizer and Moderna, for instance).
From an operational standpoint, a vast literature studies vaccine supply chains (see Duijzer
et al. 2018, Lemmens et al. 2016). A first area involves optimizing vaccine composition (Wu et al.
2005, Kornish and Keeney 2008, Cho 2010, Bandi and Bertsimas 2020). A second area focuses
on vaccine production to manage supply-side and demand-side uncertainty and mitigate incentive
misalignments between manufacturers and end users (Chick et al. 2008, Federgruen and Yang 2009,
Arifoğlu et al. 2012). Next, vaccine allocation optimizes the management of a vaccine stockpile
(Sun et al. 2009, Mamani et al. 2013). Last, vaccine delivery optimizes inventory, distribution
and dispensing operations (Jacobson et al. 2006a, Aaby et al. 2006, Dai et al. 2016). Most of
this research focuses on predictable and repeatable epidemics, such as seasonal influenza. For
less predictable epidemics, such as pandemic influenza, advance planning interventions include
stockpiling (Jacobson et al. 2006b) and anticipatory vaccination (Arinaminpathy et al. 2012).
Unfortunately, these approaches are not readily applicable to a new disease such as COVID-19.
Our paper deals with centralized vaccine allocation within a population. Early studies established
the importance of partitioning the population into risk classes (e.g., age groups) to reflect the
impact of an epidemic (Watson 1972, Elveback et al. 1976, Longini Jr et al. 1978). Emanuel and
Wertheimer (2006) propose a life-cycle model that prioritizes the most valuable subpopulations.
Within a region, results suggest prioritizing at-risk populations (Patel et al. 2005, Chowell et al.

Bertsimas, Digalakis Jr., Jacquillat, Li, Previero: Where to locate mass vaccination sites?

2009) or active agents who can spread the disease fastest, such as school children (Dushoff et al.
2007, Basta et al. 2009, Medlock and Galvani 2009, Lee et al. 2012, Matrajt et al. 2013). Across
regions, results suggest that vaccines should be allocated to the most infected regions and to those
affected the latest by the epidemic (Araz et al. 2012, Keeling and Shattock 2012).
Methodologically, most studies integrate SEIR or similar epidemiological models into simple
optimization routines based on scenario analysis, enumeration, simulation, or simple heuristics
(Uribe-Sánchez et al. 2011, Teytelman and Larson 2013). Tanner et al. (2008) propose a chanceconstrained optimization approach to ensure that the post-vaccination reproduction number is
lower than one with high probability. Yarmand et al. (2014) formulate a two-stage stochastic
programming model to first plan vaccine allocation and then distribute additional doses where the
epidemic has not been contained. They model the dynamics of disease propagation by means of a
stochastic SEIR model, and define scenarios using Monte Carlo simulation. In contrast, this paper
directly embeds SEIR dynamics into an optimization model to support vaccine distribution.
Finally, this paper contributes to the fast-growing field of vaccine distribution in the midst of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Recent and ongoing research spans vaccine production (Khamsi 2020), equity
in vaccine distribution (Muriel and Bauchner 2021, Bae et al. 2020), and public acceptance (Dror
et al. 2020, Coustasse et al. 2021). In terms of vaccine distribution, Rastegar et al. (2021) propose
a mixed-integer formulation to support influenza vaccine distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic. Matrajt et al. (2020) study which populations to prioritize in a mass vaccination campaign,
trading off vaccinating high-risk (older) age-groups vs. high-transmission (younger) age-groups in
a given location. In contrast, this paper optimizes the distribution of vaccines across locations.
This relates to Grauer et al. (2020), who study the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines, using
an SEIR model to test various strategies based on demographic and epidemiological factors.
This paper expands this recent body of work in three major ways. First, we optimize vaccine
allocation across regions and risk classes (e.g., age groups), based on data-driven estimates of
infection and mortality rates. Second, we leverage a recent SEIR-inspired epidemiological model
that captures dynamics specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as under-detection, governmental
response, and declining mortality rates. Third, we propose a formal optimization approach and a
coordinate descent algorithm to explicitly optimize vaccine distribution strategies, as opposed to
relying on enumeration, simulation or simplified heuristics.

Model formulation

Our model optimizes vaccine distribution strategy. In the US context, this primarily involves the
location of mass vaccination sites. However, optimizing these decisions requires to account for
subsequent vaccine allocation across the population, in order to further optimize and evaluate the

effects of the vaccination campaign. Therefore, we refer to as vaccine distribution strategy the set
of three decisions: (i) the location of mass vaccination sites, (ii) the allocation of vaccines across
vaccination sites, and (iii) the allocation of vaccines within each sub-population.
We capture the dynamics of the pandemic by means of an epidemiological model, called DELPHI,
which forecasts the number of detected cases, hospitalizations and deaths in each US state (Li et al.
2020).2 We review it briefly, and augment it to capture the effects of vaccinations—we refer to this
model as DELPHI–V. We then embed the DELPHI–V model into a mathematical programming
model to optimize vaccine allocation, referred to as DELPHI–V–OPT.
3.1.

DELPHI: Forecasting the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic

DELPHI is a compartmental epidemiological model, which extends the widely used SEIR model
to account for specificities of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model is governed by a system of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) across 11 states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious
(I), undetected cases who will recover (U R ) or die (U D ), hospitalized cases who will recover (H R )
or die (H D ), quarantined cases who will recover (QR ) or die (QD ), recovered (R) and dead (D).
DELPHI differs from most other COVID-19 forecasting models (see, e.g. Kissler et al. 2020,
Perkins and Espana 2020, Rodriguez et al. 2020) by capturing three key elements of the pandemic:
• Under-detection: Many cases remain undetected due to limited testing, asymptomatic car-

riers, and detection errors. Ignoring them would underestimate the scale of the pandemic. The
DELPHI model captures them through the U R and U D states.
• Governmental and societal response: Social distancing policies limit the spread of the

virus. Ignoring them would overestimate the scale of the pandemic. However, if restrictions are lifted
prematurely, a resurgence may occur. We define a governmental and societal response function
γ(t), which modulates the infection rate and is parameterized as follows:




2
−(t − tint )
(t − tjump )2
γ(t) = 1 + arctan
+ c exp −
.
π
ω
2σ 2

(1)

This parameterization defines four phases (Figure 1). In Phase I, most activities continue normally.
In Phase II, the infection rate declines sharply as policies get implemented. The parameters tint
and ω can be interpreted as the start time and strength of this response. In Phase III, the decline
reaches saturation. The epidemic then experiences a resurgence of magnitude c in Phase IV, due
to relaxations in governmental and social restrictions. This is counteracted at time tjump , when
restrictions are re-implemented, with σ controlling the duration of this second wave.

DELPHI is also applied to each country and to other provinces, but this paper focuses on US states.

Governmental and societal response function γ(t) (ω = 5, tint = 10, c = 1, tjump = 25 and σ = 2).

• Declining mortality rates: The mortality rate of COVID-19 has been declining through

the pandemic, due to a better detection of mild cases, enhanced care for COVID-19 patients, and
other factors. We model the mortality rate as a monotonically decreasing function of time:


2
m(t) = (m0 − mmin ) 1 + arctan (−rm t) + mmin ,
π

(2)

where m0 is the initial mortality rate, mmin is the minimum mortality rate and rm is a decay rate.
Ultimately, DELPHI involves 16 parameters that define the transition rates between the 11
states. We calibrate seven of them from a database on clinical outcomes (Bertsimas et al. 2020).
Using non-linear optimization, we estimate the other 9 parameters from historical data on the
number of cases and deaths in each region. We refer to Li et al. (2020) for details.
Since its inception in March 2020, DELPHI has been extensively tested and validated against
real-world data. Figure 2 reports the historical performance of the model in the United States,
during the first wave in the Spring of 2020 and the second wave in the Fall of 2020. As the figure
shows, the model has been predicting the magnitude of the pandemic with high accuracy up to
one month in advance; for instance, as early as April 3, 2020, the model was predicting 1.2–1.4
million cases in the United States by early May, a prediction that became quite accurate a month
later (Figure 2a). Obviously, subsequent forecasts, by leveraging more up-to-date information, were
able to refine these estimates. As a result, the DELPHI model was incorporated into the ensemble
forecast from the US Center for Disease Control (2020a). During the second wave of the pandemic,
DELPHI continued to exhibit strong predictive performance, with a mean average percentage error
among the lowest of the CDC ensemble forecast (Figure 2b).

Predictive DELPHI–V: Capturing the effects of vaccination

We now augment the DELPHI model to capture two key aspects of vaccinations:
1. Disparate impacts of the disease across risk classes. Age is one of the primary drivers of
mortality (Guan et al. 2020, Goyal et al. 2020, Petrilli et al. 2020). The US Center for Disease
Control (2020b) reports that the mortality rate among Americans aged 70 and over is two
orders of magnitude greater than for those aged 30 and under. We partition the population
into risk classes, defined as homogeneous groups with comparable health characteristics. We
consider age-based risk classes in our experiments, but other categorizations could be used
(e.g., based on comorbidities). Accordingly, we replicate the 11 model states for each risk class.
2. Impact of vaccinations on the dynamics of the pandemic. A fraction of vaccinated people
will be immune to the disease (based on the vaccine’s effectiveness). Clinical trials suggest
that early-approved vaccines prevent mortality but not necessarily infections. Therefore, we
assume conservatively that all vaccinated people can still transmit the disease. We relax this
assumption later on, to show the robustness of our results when a fraction of vaccinated
people become fully immune to the disease. We create four new model states: susceptible and
vaccinated (S 0 ), exposed and vaccinated (E 0 ), infected and vaccinated (I 0 ), and immune (M ).
Figure 3 shows a simplified flow diagram of the DELPHI–V model, with two risk classes (indexed
by k = 1, 2 and indicated via subscripts). For expositional purposes, we omit dependencies on the
region, since the DELPHI–V model is fitted in each region independently. In the remainder of
this paper, we also ignore the recovery states, since they do not impact the death-minimization

optimization model. Accordingly, we denote the states of undetected, hospitalized and quarantined
people who will die from the disease by U , H and Q (as opposed to U D , H D and QD ).

Let Vk (t) denote the population mass from risk class k ∈ K that gets vaccinated at time t ∈ T , and
let β ∈ (0, 1] denote the vaccine’s effectiveness. For simplicity, we make three assumptions. First,
the effects of vaccines are instantaneous (relaxing this assumption, although straightforward, would
merely induce a time lag into the system, without significantly impacting the vaccine distribution
strategy). Second, the vaccine has no effect when it fails to immunize the patient (i.e., no partial
benefit and no side effect). Third, we consider single-dose vaccines (double-dose vaccines would
again induce a time lag without impacting the vaccine distribution strategy). Then, at each time
t ∈ T , a mass βVk (t) of people transitions from the susceptible state Sk to the state S 0 , and the
remaining mass (1 − β)Vk (t) remains in the susceptible state. People in the S 0 state can become
exposed and infected, but then become immune to the disease (as opposed to having a positive
probability of dying from it). Note that infections are driven by the total mass of infected people,
across all risk classes and vaccinated people. All other transitions shown in Figure 3 are consistent
with the DELPHI model.

where:

– rI , rd , rD , are the progression rate, the detection rate, and the death rate;
– rkU (t), rkH (t), and rkQ (t) capture the detection, hospitalization and death rates, accounting for
the probabilities of detection and hospitalization and the mortality rate (Equation (2)). Their
dependency on t and k reflect disparities over time and across risk classes.
As noted earlier, the dynamics of exposure and infection depend on the total number of infected
people (across risk classes and vaccinated/non-vaccinated people), as opposed to the number of
infected people in a given risk class. DELPHI–V captures these interdependencies—indicated by
PK
the red rectangle in Figure 3 and the terms l=1 Il (t) + I 0 (t) in Equations (3)–(5).
Given initial conditions, the ODE equations uniquely determine the evolution of this system
over time—for a given vaccine allocation reflected in the variable V. Next, we optimize the vaccine
distribution strategy to minimize the overall impact of the pandemic—estimated by DELPHI–V.
3.3.

Prescriptive DELPHI–V–OPT: Optimizing the vaccine distribution strategy

The DELPHI–V–OPT model takes as inputs epidemiological information (estimated from the
DELPHI–V model), information on the vaccine (including vaccine effectiveness and vaccine budget), and demographic information in the United States (e.g., major cities, distance across counties,
population per county). It optimizes the vaccine distribution strategy, including the location of
mass vaccination sites and the subsequent allocation of vaccines. It is formulated as a tri-objective
model, to minimize (i) the death toll of the pandemic, (ii) the number of exposed people in the
termination period, and (iii) the distance between vaccination sites and population centers. The

Bertsimas, Digalakis Jr., Jacquillat, Li, Previero: Where to locate mass vaccination sites?

11

main public health objective is obviously death minimization, so the first objective component
is heavily prioritized. However, just considering the number of deaths could result in a waste of
vaccines near the end of the planning horizon, as individuals infected in the final periods would not
have time to flow to the death state in the epidemiological model. Therefore, the second component
of the objective minimizes the number of infections. The last component minimizes geographic
disparities. In addition, the model incorporates other equity consideration by means of fairness
constraints.
We proceed by time discretization to formulate the optimization model and retain tractability.
This reduces to solving the system of ODE equations given in Equations (3)–(13) by a forward
difference scheme. We denote by ∆t the discretization unit (e.g., 1 day).
Formally, we define the following sets, input parameters, and decision variables.
Sets
L = set of population centers in the United States (e.g., counties), {1, · · · , L}
M = set of regions in the United States (e.g., 50 states plus the District of Columbia), {1, · · · , m}
N = set of candidate vaccination sites, {1, · · · , n}
Nj = subset of candidate vaccination sites located in state j ∈ M
Nl = subset of candidate vaccination sites located in the same state as county l ∈ L
K = set of risk classes in the population (e.g., age groups), {1, · · · , K }
T = set of discretized time periods (e.g., days), {1, · · · , T }

Parameters
P opl = total population in center l ∈ L
∆li = distance from population center l ∈ L to candidate vaccination site i ∈ N
N = number of vaccination sites to be deployed across the country
Bt = number of vaccines available at time t ∈ T

Note that the parameters rU , rH and rQ are defined for each region, risk class and time period, reflecting underlying variations in mortality rates. In contrast, the parameters rI , rd and
rD are treated as uniform characteristics of the disease. In reality, these parameters may vary
across risk classes; for instance, the serological estimates from the US Center for Disease Control
(2020a) suggest different prevalence of the disease across age groups. We test this hypothesis in
our experiments, to verify the robustness of our results to the uniform infection rate assumption.
We also assume a single vaccine effectiveness value β. In theory, vaccine effectiveness might
also vary across risk classes. More importantly, there are now several vaccines available, each with
different clinical characteristics. Ideally, we could introduce an additional set to capture vaccine
heterogeneity, and let the vaccine effectiveness vary across vaccine types. This approach however,
may be somewhat impractical in practice, as it may be difficult to strategically allocate different
vaccines to different populations based on vaccine effectiveness. For equity, we therefore assume
conservatively that the mix of vaccines remains identical across vaccination sites. Under this restriction, the mix of vaccines can be reduced to a representative vaccine with average effectiveness.

Equation (14) formalizes the three objectives of the model. The first term corresponds to our
primary objective of minimizing the number of deaths over the planning horizon, across all regions
and risk classes. This number includes people in the absorbing state D, as well as the transient states
H and Q (we ignore undetected deaths). The next terms minimize, as lower-priority objectives, the
number of exposed people at the end of the horizon and the distance to the vaccination sites. The
hyperparameters λE and λD are set to small values to prioritize the death-minimization objective.
Next, the constraints capture practical considerations surrounding vaccine distribution:

14

Bertsimas, Digalakis Jr., Jacquillat, Li, Previero: Where to locate mass vaccination sites?

– Number of vaccination sites: We impose a total budget of N vaccination sites (Equation (15)). For obvious reasons, there needs to be at least one site in every state (Equation (16)).
We consider N = 100 in our experiments, which leaves flexibility to strategically deploy 49 sites.
– Assignment: Equation (17) ensures that people get assigned to vaccination sites that have
been selected. Equation (18) assigns each population center to exactly one site, in the same state.
These assignment constraints are used to compute the distance term in the objective function.
– Inter-regional vaccine capacity: Due to restrictions in vaccine manufacturing and distribution networks, a limited number of vaccines can be allocated in each time period. Equation (19)
ensures that the total number of vaccines allocated lies within the available budget in each period.
– Consistency: Equation (20) ensures that vaccines only get distributed to selected sites. Similarly, Equation (21) ensures that the number of people vaccinated in each state (across risk classes)
does not exceed the number of vaccines allocated that state. This constraint involves two assumptions. A first, conservative assumption is that people can only get vaccinated in the state that they
live in, which is required in practice for traceability purposes. Another, optimistic assumption is
that the vaccine allocation constraint applies to each state, as opposed to each vaccination site.
In other words, the model assumes vaccines can be reallocated between vaccination sites within a
state, thus maintaining a degree of freedom in intra-state vaccine distribution.
– Eligibility: We prevent people from being vaccinated twice: a patient who has been vaccinated
but remains susceptible cannot be vaccinated again. Equation (22) defines the number eligible
people as the previous number of eligible people minus the number of people for whom the vaccine
was effective and the number of people who got exposed to the disease. Equation (22) then ensures
that the number of vaccinated people lies below the number of eligible people.
– Smoothness: Large fluctuations in the number of vaccines allocated to each region from day
to day would likely cause problems from a supply chain management perspective—both to deliver
and to administer the vaccines. Equation (24) ensures that such fluctuations remain minimal. The
hyperparameter θS controls the trade-off between efficiency and smoothness.
– Fairness: To be politically and socially viable, vaccine distribution must not neglect any
region, even if it is not a virus “hot spot”. This also enhances the robustness of the solution, given
that inter-regional transmission can occur in practice. Equation (25) promotes inter-state fairness
at the strategic level, by ensuring that the fraction of vaccination sites in each state does not
deviate too much from its population share. Equation (26) promotes inter-site fairness, by ensuring
that vaccine distribution across sites does not deviate too much from uniform distribution. Finally,
Equation (27) promotes inter-state fairness at the tactical level, by ensuring that no state receives a
fraction of vaccines that exceeds its population share by a wide margin. The hyperparameters ΘL ,
θV and θP control the trade-off between efficiency and fairness. As the results will show, even tight
fairness constraints leave critical flexibility when locating vaccination sites and allocating vaccines.

– DELPHI–V dynamics: Equations (28)–(38) capture the dynamics of the DELPHI–V model
in a discretized time space (Equations (3)–(13)).
– Domain of definition: Equation (39) defines the domain of each variable.
Model Structure
Problem (P ) is a non-linear program, due to the bilinear terms in Equations (28)–(31), which
reflect the fact that the number of new infections result from the interactions between susceptible
and infected populations—a key characteristic of all SEIR-based compartmental models. These
bilinear terms result in non-convex constraints, thus in a highly challenging optimization model.
The latest Gurobi 9.0 release includes a solver for non-convex quadratic problems (Gurobi Optimization 2020). Yet, general-purpose technologies are limited to small-scale instances. In our
setting, Problem (P ) includes 2m(K + 1)T non-convex constraints each involving 2(K + 1) bilinear
terms, for a total of 4mT (K + 1)2 bilinear terms. A realistically-sized problem with M = 51 (50 US
states plus Washington, D.C.), K = 6 (6 age groups) and T = 90 (a 3 month planning horizon with
daily discretization) would result in nearly 900,000 bilinear terms. Problem (P ) remains intractable
with existing commercial solvers, motivating the development of a tailored algorithm.

4.

Solution algorithm

We propose an iterative coordinate descent algorithm to solve Problem (P ) in short computational
times—consistent with practical requirements. We describe the algorithm in this section. We also
present three baselines replicating reasonable strategies that could be implemented in the absence
of our data-driven optimization model. These baselines are used for two purposes: (i) to provide
an initial feasible solution in the coordinate descent algorithm, and (ii) as benchmarks to evaluate
the benefits of the data-driven optimization approach proposed in this paper.
4.1.

Algorithm design

Our algorithm relies on two key observations: 1) aside from Equations (28)–(31), the objective
function and all other constraints in (P ) are linear, and 2) given a fixed vaccine distribution strategy,
the discretized DELPHI–V model can be solved efficiently. Therefore, we proceed by coordinate
descent, alternating between two modules: one that optimizes the vaccination distribution strategy
given the infection dynamics, and one that simulates the bilinear dynamics of the pandemic for a
given vaccination distribution strategy. The optimization part reduces to a linear program, which
can be solved very efficiently. Using the resultant vaccine distribution, the simulation part reestimates the infected population under bilinear dynamics, using a forward discretization scheme.
Specifically, the two modules are defined as follows:

Bertsimas, Digalakis Jr., Jacquillat, Li, Previero: Where to locate mass vaccination sites?

16

1. Simulate: Based on a vaccine allocation solution V, we compute the DELPHI–V dynamics
from t = 0 to t = T (Section 3.2) by solving the ODE system (Equations (3)–(13)) using a
forward difference scheme in a discretized time space. This terminates in O(M KT ) operations.
We denote the total infected population (across all risk classes and vaccinated people) in region

j at time t ∈ T by Ibjt =

. We refer to this procedure as Simulate (x, C, W, V).

2. Optimize: Given the infectious population estimates bI, we can approximate Equation (28)–
(31) by the following linear constraints. The problem can then be efficiently solved as a linear

We iterate between the Simulate and Optimize modules, until convergence. Specifically, the
algorithm terminates when the variation in the objective function value remains minimal from one
iteration to the next. The pseudocode summarizing this approach is presented in Algorithm 1. We
turn next to the generation of an initial feasible solution.
4.2.

Baselines

We propose three simple and interpretable baselines for generating a feasible solution to (P ). By
design, these baselines are heuristics that solely rely on the inputs of the optimization models, as
opposed to requiring the full model and algorithm developed in this paper.
Top-cities baseline: This approach prioritizes cities based on population. Specifically, it deploys
vaccination sites in the most populous cities, while accounting for the constraint that each state
must have at least one center (Equation (16)). Subsequently, it allocates an equal fraction of the
daily vaccine budget to each vaccination site: we fix the variables x and C, run the model to
optimize vaccine allocation within each state, and estimate the resulting number of deaths. This
baseline corresponds to a city-level approach based on demographic information alone.
Population-based baseline: Under this approach, the number of vaccination sites deployed in
each state is based on the state’s population share. This is formulated as follows, where yj is a
decision variable denoting the number of vaccination sites in state j.

We then solve DELPHI–V–OPT, while fixing the aggregate number of vaccination sites per state,

i.e., i∈Nj xi = yj , and assuming equal allocation of vaccines across vaccination sites, i.e., Cit =

B,
N t

∀t ∈ T . The model allocates vaccines within each state and estimates the number of deaths.

This baseline corresponds to a state-level approach based on demographic information alone.
Case-based baseline: Under this approach, the number of vaccination sites deployed in each
state is based on the number of COVID-19 cases at the beginning of the planning horizon. This is
formulated as follows, where yj is a decision variable denoting the number of vaccination sites in
state j and Casesj denotes the case count in state j.

We then proceed as with the population-based baseline, by fixing the number of vaccination sites
per state, assuming equal vaccine allocation across sites, and re-solving the model. This baseline
corresponds to a state-level approach based on epidemiological information alone.
By design, these baselines satisfy all constraints of Problem (P ), and thus provide valid initializations into our coordinate descent algorithm. They also provide sensible and equitable benchmarks
based on readily-available demographic information (e.g., census data) and epidemiological information (e.g., case counts), hence easily implementable. Comparisons between our optimized
solution and these benchmarks thus estimate the benefits of vaccine distribution optimization.

Experimental setup

We implement the proposed model and algorithm in the United States. We select N = 100 vaccination sites out of the 500 most populous cities in the United States as candidate locations (set
N ) We define the set M as 51 “states” (the 50 states plus the District of Columbia) and the set
L as the 3,006 counties. We define six risk classes based on six relatively coarse age groups: 0-9

years, 10-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years, 70-79 years, and 80 years and above. These simplified
risk classes facilitate the practical implementation of the solution while capturing broad trends in
mortality rates. We define the time horizon T as the three-month period from February to April
2021, consistently with the ongoing planning horizon of the US federal government.
5.1.

Data sources

We calibrate the model using multiple data sources (Figure 4). First, we estimate the parameters
of the DELPHI model (without vaccinations) independently for each state, using historical data on
cases and deaths from the New York Times (2020). We obtain a granular population breakdown
by age for each state from the US Census Bureau (2020). We then run DELPHI (still, without
vaccinations) to derive the initial susceptible, exposed and infected populations (on January 30,
2021), which we distribute among the risk classes proportionally to their size.
The next input is an estimate of the mortality rate per region, risk class and time period. We make
use of the data from the US Center for Disease Control (2021), which report the total number of
confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths by age group in the United States until the
end of January 2021. In contrast, the DELPHI model fits a time-dependent mortality rate within
each region. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no other data source for nationwide cases
and deaths by age group. This leaves a discrepancy between the time-independent estimates at the
risk class level from the CDC, and the time-varying estimates at the region-level from DELPHI.
To reconcile these data, we employ an optimization procedure that interpolates the mortality rate
per region, risk class and time period. We present this approach in the next section.
5.2.

Mortality rate estimation

Our procedure to estimate mortality rates starts from two sets of inputs:
bjt denote the estimated number of new detected cases in region
• DELPHI predictions: Let X
d
b j,t+τ
j ∈ M and time period t ∈ T . Let D
denote the number of deaths, where τj is the median
j

death time after detection in region j. These quantities are aggregated across risk classes.
• CDC data: Let XkCDC and DkCDC denote the number of cases and deaths for risk class k ∈ K.

These quantities are aggregated across regions and time periods.
We define the reference mortality rate mjk of risk class k ∈ K based in region j as follows:

By design, this expression preserves the ratio of mortality rates between different risk classes from
the CDC data, while correcting the mean reference mortality rate in each region across the planning
horizon to be in line with the DELPHI projections.
We then estimate the mortality rate for each region j ∈ M, risk class k ∈ K, and time period
t ∈ T , denoted by mjkt . We also introduce additional decision variables Xjkt and Dj,k,t+τj , reflecting
the number of detected cases and the number of future deaths in region j assigned to risk class
k ∈ K and time period t ∈ T . Given that the fitting procedure is done separately in each region
j ∈ M, we decouple the problem at the region level—thereby considerably reducing the size of each
problem instance. Specifically, we formulate the optimization problem given in Equations (41)–(48).

The first term in Equation (41) minimizes the squared relative error between the mortality rate
estimates and their reference values (Equation (40)). The second term is a regularization penalty
that minimizes deviations between the proportion of detected cases and the proportion pjk of the
population, in each risk class. The parameter λM trades off these two objectives (we use λM =
0.1 in our experiments). Equations (42)–(43) ensure consistency with the DELPHI predictions.
Equation (44) defines the mortality rate as the ratio between the number of deaths and cases.
Equations (45)–(46) ensure that mortality rates are decreasing over time and monotonic with risk
classes. Finally, Equations (47)–(48) define the domain of the variables.
Note that the problem is non-linear due to the bilinear term in Equation (44). Yet, thanks to the
decoupling at the region level, we can solve the problem using the quadratic solver in Gurobi 9.0
(Gurobi Optimization 2020), which addresses non-convexities using branching and cutting planes
algorithms. In practice, a solution within a 1% optimality gap is generally obtained within minutes.
The output of this algorithm is an estimate of the mortality rate at the level of each state and
each risk class, in each time period. We report aggregated statistics in Table 1.

Implementation details

Our DELPHI–V–OPT model relies on a forward difference scheme to simulate the dynamics of
the pandemic, for any vaccine allocation. If the discretization is too coarse, the algorithm will
introduce truncation errors. If, however, the discretization is too granular, computational times

Bertsimas, Digalakis Jr., Jacquillat, Li, Previero: Where to locate mass vaccination sites?

21

will be prohibitively long. After extensive experimentations, we found ∆t = 1 day to yield the best
compromise. It is also practical choice as it yields a day-by-day plan.
The coordinate descent scheme terminates when the change in the objective function value lies
below a pre-determined threshold. We set the termination tolerance to ε = 0.1%.
Regarding DELPHI-V–OPT, we vary the hyperparameters λE , λV , θS , ΘL , θV and θP to balance
efficiency with practical and fairness considerations, and perform sensitivity analyses on these
parameters. We consider a baseline vaccine effectiveness of 90% (in line with the values from the
first vaccine approvals) and a baseline budget of 1 million vaccines per day (which can be viewed
as 1 million single-dose vaccines, 2 million double-dose vaccines or a combination thereof). Given
the strong underlying uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the robustness
of the benefits of our optimization outputs to vaccine effectiveness and vaccine budget.
All optimization models are implemented in Gurobi 9.0, with 2.3GHz processor and 4 cores. We
use a barrier method to solve each linear program, with a barrier convergence tolerance of 10−6 .

6.

Experimental results

We now present results obtained with the modeling and algorithmic framework developed in this
paper. Our main focus is on the location of the 100 vaccination sites—decisions that have to be
made immediately—as opposed to vaccine allocation—decisions that can be revisited continuously
over time as more information becomes available. We first evaluate the benefits of the optimized
solution against baseline approaches, and then establish the robustness of these benefits.
6.1.

Benefits of optimizing the vaccine distribution strategy

Figure 5 shows the heatmap of vaccination sites across all 51 states (the exact list of proposed
locations is reported in the appendix). Recall that, by design, the optimized solution deploys at
least one vaccination site per state (Equation (16)). In addition, one of the fairness constraints
(Equation (25) anchors the number of vaccination sites per state to its population share. Other
than that, the vaccination sites are deployed strategically to curb the spread of the pandemic.
As a result, the optimized number of vaccination sites varies significantly per state, as a function
of underlying demographic and epidemiological factors. For instance, the four largest states by
population (California, Texas, Florida and New York) receive the most vaccination sites (6 to 10
each). In contrast, the smaller states receive only one vaccination site. Ultimately, the heatmap
suggests that the optimized solution targets large population centers and some of the hot spots of
the pandemic, while ensuring equity nationwide.
Then, could we have achieved a similar solution with some of our benchmarks (Section 4.2), which
determine the locations of the vaccination sites based on demographic and epidemiological data
but do not make use of our epidemiological and optimization models? To investigate this question,

we evaluate the dynamics of the pandemic under each of the three baselines. When it comes to the
optimization, we derive three solutions: (i) an “optimized locations” solution, which optimizes the
site locations decisions freely (without fairness constraints) but then allocates vaccines uniformly
across the 100 selected vaccination sites; (ii) a “fully optimized” solution, which optimizes the site
locations decisions and vaccine allocation decisions freely (without fairness constraints); and (iii) a
“proposed” solution, which optimizes the site locations decisions and vaccine allocation decisions
with fairness constraints. For each solution, Table 2 reports the number of lives saved by the
vaccination campaign, as compared to a solution without vaccinations.
Let us start with the main observation: the optimized solutions provides significant benefits,
as compared to all benchmarks. Comparing the “optimized locations” solution to the top-cities
benchmark, we find that optimizing locations alone can save around 4,500 lives over the threemonth period under consideration, enhancing the impact of the vaccination campaign by 24%.
Moving to the “fully optimized” solution, we note that jointly optimizing locations and vaccine
allocation achieves further benefits, by saving an extra 2,000 lives and increasing the benefits
over the benchmark to 35%. These results underscore the potential of the proposed optimization
approach, which leverages available vaccines strategically to target the regions that need them
most. Another observation is that determining the locations of vaccination sites does not achieve
all potential benefits of the vaccination campaign, underscoring the role of downstream vaccine
allocation as an extra lever to combat the pandemic.

A downside of these two solutions (“locations optimized” and “fully optimized”), however, is
that they can result in very inequitable outcomes between states and between vaccination sites.
The last (“proposed”) solution circumvents this challenge by imposing all fairness constraints
(Equations (25)–(27)), and choosing tight values for the corresponding hyperparameters ΘL , θV and
θP . As such, the proposed solution ensures fairness across various dimensions (site locations, vaccine
allocation across states, and vaccine allocation across sites). Remarkably, even when constraining
the optimization as such, the resulting proposed solution still results in 20% benefits, as compared
to the top-cities benchmark—saving 4,000 deaths over the three-month horizon.
In comparison, the benchmarks cannot reach the same impact of vaccinations. The top-cities
and population-based benchmarks achieve similar outcomes, with 19,000–20,000 lives saved as
compared to a no-vaccination baseline. The case-based baseline performs better, by saving 21,000
lives (10% more than the top-cities baseline). Yet, these numbers remain significantly lower than
those achieved with our solution. The top-cities and population-based baselines, by relying on
demographic information exclusively, fail account for disparities in the severity of the across the
country. The case-based baseline captures the status of the pandemic, but not its dynamics, thus
treating similarly a state where the pandemic is already waning and a state where it is rising
fast—although vaccinations have a stronger impact in the latter state than the former.
These results underscore the main takeaways from this paper: optimization provides significant
benefits, as compared to simple benchmarks based on readily-available information at the outset of
the vaccination campaign. Instead, the optimized approaches design vaccine distribution strategies

24

based on both demographics and epidemiological dynamics. The edge of optimization can be significant, by saving an extra 20% of lives with the same vaccine capacity. Stated differently, under
the proposed optimization approach, each vaccine is effectively “worth” 1.2 vaccines.
A natural question to ask is whether optimization induces strong geographic disparities, by
merely shifting the benefits of the vaccines from one state to another. To explore this question,
Figure 6 plots the number of vaccines distributed to each state, as compared to its population share
(Figure 6a) and the number of lives saved, as compared to the top-cities benchmark (Figure 6b).

(b) Lives saved

Vaccine allocation (vs. population share) and lives saved (vs. population-based baseline) per state.

Recall that the optimization imposes fairness constraints in vaccine allocation (Equations (25)–
(27)); yet, the remaining flexibility can be used strategically to target the populations where vaccines can have the strongest impact. In fact, as Figure 6a shows, vaccines do not get distributed
proportionally to each state’s population. For instance, states like Texas, Florida and New York
receive a higher share of vaccines, whereas states like California, Pennsylvania and Illinois receive
a lower share. This is expected, given the significantly higher number of lives saved under the
optimized (“proposed”) solution as compared to the population-based benchmark (Table 2).
However, Figure 6b shows that these disparities in vaccine allocation do not result in sharp
disparities in public health outcomes. Specifically, the optimized solution saves hundreds of extra
lives (as compared to the population-based benchmark) in seven states with very different epidemiological profiles. Texas benefits the most from optimization (with an additional 1,450 lives
saved), followed by New York (440), Florida (380) and Iowa (290). At the same time, the optimized
solution does not increase the death toll in any state by more than 100. Pennsylvania is the most

25

negatively impacted state, with an estimated 85 additional deaths—well within the margin of error
of DELPHI–V. Overall, the proposed optimization approach can thus distribute vaccine capacities
to combat the pandemic in some critical states without hurting others.
6.2.

Sensitivity and robustness

A core challenge in vaccine distribution lies in the significant uncertainty regarding the dynamics
of the pandemic and the effect of vaccinations. To address this challenge, we assess the sensitivity
and the robustness of the optimized solution when the structure of the DELPHI–V model and
some of its key parameters are perturbed. For each perturbation, we compare three solutions:
– the top-cities baseline, evaluated with the new perturbed model
– the re-optimized solution, optimized and evaluated with the new perturbed model
– the proposed solution, optimized with the original model and evaluated with the new perturbed model. Specifically, we first run the optimization with the initial inputs. We then introduce
perturbations, and re-optimize vaccine allocation decisions (variables C and V), while fixing the
vaccination sites (variable x). Indeed, in practice, vaccination sites are determined once and for
all, whereas vaccine allocation can be re-adjusted as information becomes available.
We then compare the number of deaths under these three solutions, estimated with the perturbed
DELPHI–V model. Comparisons between the top-cities benchmark and the re-optimized solution
estimate the sensitivity of the benefits of optimization to the perturbations. Comparisons between

Sensitivity and robustness of results with varying vaccine effectiveness and vaccine budget.

We first vary the two main drivers of the vaccination campaign, that are the vaccine effectiveness
(parameter β) and the vaccine budget (parameters Bt ). Figure 7 reports the percent-wise increase
in saved lives, as compared to the top-cities benchmark, for both the proposed and the re-optimized

26

solutions. The main takeaways fall under three categories. First, the benefits of optimization increase with vaccine effectiveness. This is expected, as a higher vaccine effectiveness increases the
impact of all strategies (in the extreme example where β = 0, all strategies have the same null
performance). Second, the benefits of optimization decrease with vaccine budget. Indeed, in the
extreme scenario with an infinite vaccine budget, any distribution strategy can immediately end
the pandemic, leaving essentially no space for optimization. As the budget becomes more scarce,
the decisions of who receives a vaccine and when become increasingly complex, so the optimized
strategy has a positive and significant impact on the spread of the disease. It is interesting to note
that this monotonic relationship would get inverted in the other regime with a small vaccine budget (again, all solutions perform identically when the budget gets to zero). Yet, with the current
vaccine capacities, the benefits of optimization are very strong, saving an extra 15–35% of lives.
The third takeaway from Figure 7 is the high degree of robustness of the proposed solution. In
all but one experiment, the proposed solution remains optimal under the perturbed parameters
(indicated by exactly the same benefits obtained with the proposed solution and the re-optimized
solution). In the last case (with a daily budget of 500,000 vaccines), the proposed solution is
dominated by the re-optimized solution, but remains within 2% of the new optimum. Obviously,
the new values of vaccine effectiveness and vaccine budgets impact downstream vaccine allocations
and the dynamics of the pandemic. However, the location of vaccination sites is highly robust to
variations in vaccine effectiveness and vaccine budgets.
Next, we test the robustness of the proposed solution to the dynamics of the pandemic. One
assumption of DELPHI–V is that the infection rate (captured by the parameters αj and γjt ) is
identical across age groups. However, serological evidence suggests potential disparities in infections
across sub-populations. To test this, we vary the infection rates with the risk class k, by adjusting
the relative variations based on the serological estimates from the US Center for Disease Control
(2020a). Another assumption is that vaccines prevent mortality but not infection and transmission.
In practice, vaccines may still reduce the risk of infection and the propensity to transmit the disease.
To test this, we perturb the DELPHI–V model by assuming that a fraction β of vaccinated people
transition directly to the immune state M (as opposed to the susceptible and vaccinated state S 0 ).
Figure 8 reports the results from these new perturbations, using the same nomenclature as
Figure 7. The main takeaway is identical, in that the proposed solution remains near-optimal under
the two perturbations. In both tests, the proposed solution results in less than 50 extra deaths
than the re-optimized solution—a very small amount in view of the 20,000 lives saved by the
optimization. In other words, the proposed solution is not only robust to vaccination characteristics
(effectiveness and budget) but also to the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finally, we vary two key parameters in the DELPHI–V dynamics: the infection and mortality
rates. Although these parameters are fitted from historical data, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the dynamics of the pandemic and people’s behaviors through a period of mass
vaccination. Therefore, we introduce a random perturbation in the infection or mortality rate, in
each state. Specifically, we define 50 perturbation scenarios; in each one, we sample each parameter
in each state independently, following a uniform distribution centered around the nominal value
and spanning ±20%. Therefore, the full range of infection and mortality rates spans 40% of the
nominal value—thus capturing instances where the estimated infection and mortality rates in the
DELPHI–V model are subject to very large errors.
Figure 9 reports the distribution of the benefits of optimization under these 50 scenarios, with
perturbed infection rates (Figure 9a) and mortality rates (Figure 9b). We compare here the proposed solution (obtained with the nominal values of the infection and mortality rates) and the
top-cities benchmark, both evaluated with the perturbed infection and mortality rates. As the
results show, the benefits of optimization remains highly significant, and robust to the perturbations. Recall that the benefits of optimization were estimated at 20% under the nominal infection
and mortality rates (Table 2). After perturbations, they span 12.5%–30% with perturbations in
the infection rates and 17.5%–25% with the perturbed mortality rates. In other words, even if
the DELPHI–V model makes large errors when estimating the key dynamics of the pandemic, the
proposed optimized vaccination sites still increase the impact of the vaccination campaign by over
10%. In fact, the variations can go either way: in over half the simulations, the relative benefits of
the optimized solution are even higher under the perturbed parameters than the nominal ones.
Note, finally, that the infection rate has a more significant impact on the relative benefits of
optimized vaccine allocation than the mortality rate. This suggests that the impact of the pandemic
depends mainly on how vaccines can curb infections at the upstream level—as opposed to mortality

at the downstream level. This, again, illustrates the effects of the non-linear SEIR dynamics on
the spread of the disease, and how we can leverage an epidemiological model such as DELPHI–V
to allocate resources strategically in order to combat the pandemic most effectively.
From a practical standpoint, the results from this section are highly significant. Indeed, the
DELPHI–V model, like any epidemiological model, only provides a rough approximation of the dynamics of the pandemic and the effects of vaccinations. Yet, the robustness of the solution provides
guarantees that the locations of mass vaccination sites, even optimized against this approximate
model, remain highly robust when evaluated against alternative dynamics. This is obviously not
to say that we can commit to a full-scale vaccine distribution strategy that spans the entire vaccination campaign. However, the “here-and-now” decisions (i.e., the location of vaccination sites)
are likely to remain near-optimal (or even optimal) in the next phases of the pandemic, ultimately
enabling the vaccination campaign to save an extra 15–35% of lives.

Conclusion

This paper has presented a new prescriptive approach to optimize vaccine distribution strategies in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach starts with a state-of-the-art epidemiological
model called DELPHI, which augments SEIR models by capturing dynamics specific to COVID-19
(under-detection, governmental and societal response, and declining mortality rates). This paper
has first proposed an extension, named DELPHI–V, which captures the effects of vaccinations and
reflects the disaggregated impact of COVID-19 on mortality across risk classes (e.g., age groups).
Then, this paper has embedded the predictive DELPHI–V model into an optimization model,
termed DELPHI–V–OPT, to support vaccine distribution. DELPHI–V–OPT is formulated as a
bilinear optimization model, and solved using a tailored algorithm based on coordinate descent.

We applied the model and algorithm to one of the priorities of the new Biden administration in
the United States: determining the locations of mass vaccination sites across the country. We formalize the problem by selecting locations strategically to minimize the death toll of the pandemic,
subject to practical and fairness constraints. Experimental results using real-world data suggest
that the proposed optimization approach can yield significant benefits, as compared to benchmark
solutions that locate vaccination sites based on readily-available demographic and epidemiological
information. Specifically, the model can increase the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign by
20%, saving an extra 4,000 lives over a three-month period. Remarkably, the proposed solution
achieves critical fairness objectives—by significantly reducing the death toll of the pandemic in
several states without hurting others—and is highly robust to uncertainties and forecast errors—by
achieving similar benefits under a vast range of perturbations.
Obviously, the optimization approach developed in this paper is not without limitations. For
instance, our experiments have only partitioned the population according to age groups, thus
ignoring other objectives such as prioritizing allocations to healthcare workers, other essential
workers, or patients with comorbidities. Moreover, our epidemiological model does not capture
heterogeneity in population mixing across subpopulations (e.g., interactions may be more intense
in urban areas and between young people than in rural areas and between older populations).
Similarly, our model only captures the first-order effects of vaccinations, ignoring for instance
heterogeneity across multiple vaccine types and double-dose vaccines. Finally, our methodology
relies on a time discretization approximation and a coordinate descent approach, which do not
yield theoretical guarantees on solution quality.
Whereas these limitations undoubtedly motivate further research, this paper lays the first datadriven brick on the optimal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. At a time where vaccine development and vaccine production are going full speed, the results from this paper highlight the
critical role of vaccine distribution strategies to combat the pandemic. Obviously, it is essential
to make every effort possible to develop new vaccines, enhance vaccine effectiveness, and produce
as many vaccines as possible. But this paper highlights another lever that can be pulled to curb
the effect of the pandemic: strategically managing vaccine stockpiles to prevent the spread of the
pandemic and mitigate its impact. As such, this paper can provide critical decision-making support
to governmental agencies as they are currently planning mass vaccinations around the globe.
