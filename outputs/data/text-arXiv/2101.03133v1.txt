Abstract: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused tremendous amount
of deaths and a devastating impact on the economic development all over the world. Thus, it is
paramount to control its further transmission, for which purpose it is necessary to find the
mechanism of its transmission process and evaluate the effect of different control strategies. To
deal with these issues, we describe the transmission of COVID-19 as an explosive Markov process
with four parameters. The state transitions of the proposed Markov process can clearly disclose
the terrible explosion and complex heterogeneity of COVID-19. Based on this, we further propose
a simulation approach with heterogeneous infections. Experimentations show that our approach
can closely track the real transmission process of COVID-19, disclose its transmission mechanism,
and forecast the transmission under different non-drug intervention strategies. More importantly,
our approach can helpfully develop effective strategies for controlling COVID-19 and
appropriately compare their control effect in different countries/cities.

On January 24, 2020, a Chinese Lunar New Year eve, the Coronavirus Disease
2019 (COVID-19) outbreak began in Wuhan, a beautiful provincial capital city in
Hubei province, China. Up to now, the COVID-19 has become even more serious all
over the world. As of Dec. 29, 2020, there are more than 81 million cumulative cases
in the world, including more than 22 million active cases (https://github.com/
CSSEGISandData /COVID-19). The global outbreak transmission of COVID-19 has
seriously endangered human health, extremely destroyed daily life of people, and
caused huge economic losses in many countries1,2. Therefore, it is imperative to find
some effective methods for evaluating and predicting the transmission processes of
COVID-19 and the control effect of intervention strategies. For the evaluation and
prediction of COVID-19, the current mainstream is the SIR based epidemiological
model3-5. The classical SIR model ignores several important factors, such as the
heterogeneity and explosibility of COVID-19, and a huge initial number of patients.
Furthermore, a patient can infect multiple persons each time. Therefore, such SIR
models are not suitable for the explosive growth of patients, and the inter-person
infection among a huge initial number of patients.
Now, it is necessary to explain some key characteristics of COVID-19
transmission processes. The transmission of COVID-19 consists of multiple stages
with different levels of infection6,7. The exponential growth of infections was found
during its initial stage8-10. COVID-19 is observed to be highly infectious11,12 with a
high portion of severe cases2. In addition, some studies used the Poisson processes to
model the COVID-19 transmission13, and provided the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
2

method to evaluate the basic reproductive number14. The transmission of COVID-19
was found to be seasonal15,16. Also, the infection of COVID-19 becomes really terrible
at a very low temperature in the winter17. In the beginning of 2021, the COVID-19
has become even more active and serious in many countries. Therefore, the
prevention and control of COVID-19 in the world will continue facing huge
challenges in 2021.
So far, we have found that the prevention and control of COVID-19 include four
non-drug intervention strategies18-23: Travel restrictions24-27, early identification and
isolation28-36, increasing social distance37-40, and exposure restrictions30,41-44. It was
indicated that we will have to live with COVID-19 in the decades ahead45. Thus, the
non-drug intervention strategies can play an important role in the prevention and
control of COVID-19 transmission due to the fact that no effective drug is found for
treating COVID-19.
To describe and analyze the complex transmission of COVID-19, this paper is
devoted to developing an approach for evaluating and predicting the transmission
processes of COVID-19, which is modeled as a Markov process with explosive
structure. Our model needs four basic parameters to capture the basic characteristics
of the COVID-19 transmission process: the explosive growth of patients, and the
batching infection of an infected person. These four parameters can be estimated
based on public data (https://github.com /CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). We also
propose a simulation approach with heterogeneous structure based on the proposed
Markov model and the four parameters. Experimentations on the cases of six
3

countries/cities show that our approach works well in tracking the real transmission
process of COVID-19.

Methods
We set up a novel block-structured Markov process to describe and analyze the
virus generation, infection and large-scale diffusion of COVID-19. At the same time,
this Markov process can explicitly express and track the comprehensive control effect
of the non-drug intervention strategies in different time intervals on COVID-19
transmission.
Our Markov process of COVID-19 captures several key random factors in the
transmission process of COVID-19. By applying the theory of Markov processes, the
random factors can be determined based on the framework of exponential
distributions and/or Poisson processes. Then, the random factors can be further
simplified to four key parameters as follows:
1.

The infection rate  : The number of batches of healthy people who can be
infected by one infected person per unit time. Note that the time interval between
two successively infected batches of patients is exponential with infection rate

.
2.

The disappearing rate  : The number of disappearing patients because of being
cured or death per unit time. Note that the time interval between two successively
disappearing patients is exponential with disappearing rate  .

3.

The infection batch size d : The number of healthy people that a patient can
infect each time.
4

4.

The initial patient number k : The number of patients at the initial time of our
observation in a chosen area (for example, a country, a city or a village).
Let N  t  be the number of COVID-19 patients at time t  0 . We depict the

From the Chapman-Kolmogorow equations, it is easy to see that

P  t   ω exp Qt， t  0,
where exp Qt denotes eQt .Thus, the average number of COVID-19 patients at

is the transpose of the row vector 0,1,2,3, .

On the one hand, the average number E  N  t   is a key index in the study of
COVID-19 and closely related to the four basic parameters:  ,  , d , and k . On
the other hand, it is worthwhile to note that the four parameters can be greatly
influenced by the non-drug intervention strategies. Therefore, we need to analyze the
relations between the average number E  N  t   and the non-drug intervention
strategies by means of our Markov process of COVID-19.
Now, by using the daily reported data of COVID-19 (https://github.com/CSSEGI
SandData/COVID-19), we provide some effective methods to determine the four
basic parameters:  ,  , d , and k . Further, our observation covers m days. Let
6

ni and Ni be the numbers (or data) of newly infected patients of COVID-19 and all
patients of COVID-19 on day i , respectively. We denote by ci the number of
disappeared patients of COVID-19 on day i . Thus, the infection rate  from one

Note that the initially patient number k can be directly given from the actual
data on the first day of our COVID-19 observation.
In order to take the value of the infection batch size, d, we can consider the
patients as two groups with different batch sizes. Then, the overall batch size is the
weighted average of these two groups. The weight values can be approximately
designed according to the number of existing patients in the different groups. To better
show this idea, let k represents the number of the overall patients, and ki
represents that of group i ( i =1,2). Then, the weight of group i can be determined
by ri  ki / k . See Fig. 1 for more details.

Results
In this section, we verify the effectiveness of our Markov method by simulating
for several countries. Assuming that the parameters remain stable during the
short-term observation period, we use the historical data in the observation period to
predict the trend of active cases in the future. After that, the impact of three key
parameters (i.e., the initially observed number k , the expansion batch size d and
the infection rate  ) on the transmission of COVID-19 is discussed. Note that the
three parameters can be obviously influenced by the non-drug intervention strategies.
Our observation and analysis for the three parameters in the transmission process
of COVID-19 is studied by means of our Markov processes of COVID-19; while
some necessary and useful data of COVID-19 is taken up to the end of December,
8

2020, and the observed countries with the most active cases include the State of New
York,

India,

Egypt,

South

Korea,

Italy

and

Mexico

and

so

forth

(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Here, we can simulate and
numerically analyze the evolutionary process of COVID-19 transmission for these
countries, and discuss how the three parameters influence the average number
E  N  t   of COVID-19 patients at time t . This allows us to evaluate the control

effect of the non-drug intervention strategies on the COVID-19 transmission.
Now, we simulate the development of COVID-19 active cases in six
countries/cities in a short-term period of 20 days. Different parameters are obtained
according to the actual situation of State of New York, India, Egypt, South Korea,
Italy and Mexico. Note that New York, India and Egypt represent a group of countries
or regions without obvious intervention strategies, which can be seen from the
relatively stable parameters during the observation period. We can also see that the
parameters of the other countries have obvious change points, which indicates that
they have taken obvious intervention strategies.
Because of the huge number of confirmed active cases in the United States, it
may be better to study one of its representative states: New York State. According to
the confirmed, deaths and cured cases in New York State from Nov. 6 to 25, 2020, as
shown in Table 1, we obtained the numbers of active cases, the infection rates and the
disappearing rates during this period. The average infection rate (  ) within these 20
days is determined according to Equation (1) as 0.035073852 and the average
disappearing rate (  ) within the same period is determined according to Equation (2)
9

as 0.006084398. The initial number of active cases ( k ) at the beginning of our
observation period (Nov. 6, 2020) is determined as 101592. We then simulated the
development of active cases during this short-term period for New York State. In
order for the simulated results to be close to the real data, we infer that the weights ( r )
of the two groups d1  1 , d 2  2 equal 0.971 and 0.029, respectively. The results are
shown in Fig. 3.
We further simulated the growth processes of India in Asia (Nov. 1 to 20, 2020,
Fig. 4) and Egypt in Africa (Nov. 1 to 20, 2020, Fig. 5). According to the data of India
from Nov. 1 to 20, 2020, as shown in Table 2 and in Egypt from Nov. 1 to 20, 2020,
as shown in Table 3, these simulations show that our model can well capture the
transmission process of COVID-19 during the short-term observation period.
Different from the above three countries/states, the real data of South Korea,
Italy and Mexico shows that there is a change point ( tc ) in each number of their active
cases, as shown in Fig. 6, 7 and 8. Once the change point is determined, we change
the values of parameters,  ,  , and d, at that point. The existence of the change
point reflects that the implementation of the non-drug intervention strategies has
changed the COVID-19 transmission process. Therefore, we add a change point ( tc )
during the simulation of South Korea, Italy, and Mexico.
First, based on Table 4, we calculated the four key parameters for the growth
process of the COVID-19 active cases in South Korea from Nov. 2 to 21, 2020 and
found that there is a change point ( tc = 11) at which the values of these four
parameters have changed. The reason behind this change is that, although South
10

Korea released the social distance policy, they relaxed the policy on Nov. 1, 2020. As
a result, there is an uncontrollable rebound of the epidemic in winter. The parameters
before tc are as follows: The average infection rate (  ) is 0.062135947 and the
average disappearing rate (  ) is 0.053096363. The initial number of active cases ( k )
at the beginning of our observation period (Nov. 2, 2020) is determined as 1825. We
then simulated the development of active cases in South Korea during this period. In
order to obtain simulated results close to the real data, we infer that the weights ( r ) of
the two groups d1  1 , d 2  2 equal 0.940 and 0.060, respectively. The parameters
after tc are as follows: The average infection rate is 0.09774732, the average
disappearing rate is 0.038994525, and the weights ( r ) of the two groups d1  1 ,

d 2  2 equal 0.434 and 0.566, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the simulation results,
versus with the real patient numbers of COVID-19.
For such countries with a change point, in addition to Korea, we also simulated
Italy in Europe (Nov. 11 to 30, 2020, Fig. 7) and Mexico in South America (Nov. 13
to Dec. 2, 2020, Fig 8). The reason for tc  12 in Italy may be that Italy declared a
national curfew and a state of emergency in the Lombardy region and three other
regions on Nov. 5, 2020. Similarly, tc  7 in Mexico is due to that the centralized
resettlement of victims caused by Hurricane Eta on Nov. 11, 2020 reduced people's
social distance. Furthermore, for countries and regions with longer time span and
more complex situations, the number of change points can be increased to make the
simulation close to the actual situation. According to the previous studies, we believe
that our Markov method can be generally applied to the development of COVID-19 in
11

different countries or regions.
In what follows, we evaluate the control effect of non-drug intervention
strategies. The non-drug intervention strategies can affect three parameters in the
process of COVID-19 transmission: The initial number of active cases ( k ), the
infection rate (  ), and the infection batch size ( d ). Note that the disappearing rate
(  ) does not change under the non-drug intervention strategies.
It is now generally accepted that there are four kinds of non-drug intervention
strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. The four strategies are as follows: Travel
restrictions, early identification and isolation, increasing social distance, and exposure
restrictions. In this study, we find the change point of key parameters within the
observation period by means of real data. According to the comparison between the
change point and the actual non-drug intervention strategies, we can see the control
effect of intervention strategies. Note that the non-drug intervention strategies may
affect the three parameters (  , d, and k) at the same time, and the change of
parameters has a certain delay period compared with the time of policy adoption.
Next, we analyze the effect of the non-drug intervention strategies on the control
of COVID-19 transmission. We take a 20-day observation time scale and use the data

~
of active cases within 20 days of COVID-19 transmission. Let  and  be two
values of a key parameter in the transmission process of COVID-19. We denote by

EN t  and E N~ t  the average numbers of COVID-19 patients corresponding to

~
the two values  and  , respectively. We define

，~ 

E N  t 
,
E N ~ t 
12

which expresses the control effect of COVID-19 transmission when the key parameter

~
of COVID-19 transmission is changed from  to  .
In order to analyze the control effect, we choose South Korea as an example. The
parameters have a change point, tc = 11, before which the parameters are as follows:
The average infection rate  =0.062135947, the average disappearing rate 
=0.053096363, the initial number of active cases k =1825, and the weights ( r ) of the
two groups d11 = 1, d 21 = 2, equal 0.940 and 0.060, respectively. The parameters
after tc are as follows: The average infection rate  =0.09774732, the average
disappearing rate  =0.038994525, and the weights ( r ) of the two groups d12 = 1,

d 22 = 2, equal 0.434 and 0.566, respectively. We used the above actual data of South
Korea to analyze the control effect. To this end, we suppose some non-drug

~ 1 
~ 1
intervention strategies can change the parameters as follows:  =  ; k =  k ,

where x  denotes the minimum integer higher than x; d1i =1 change to d1i =0 , d 2i

changed from r11 =0.940, r21 =0.060, r12 =0.434, r22 =0.566, respectively. These
parameters’ decrease clearly reflects the effect of the non-drug intervention strategies
on the control of COVID-19 transmission. From Fig. 9, it can be seen that the
influence of the initial value of active cases, k, on the newly infected cases is smaller,
compared to the explosive transmission process within the next periods; and the
influences of the infection rate,  , and the infection batch size, d, are significant.
Therefore, it is better to reduce  and d, rather than k in order to control COVID-19
transmission effectively.
13

Now, we take Egypt as another example to analyze such control effect. The
parameters of transmission process in Egypt are as follows:  = 0.085434063,  =
0.045978143, k = 1903, and the weights ( r ) of the two groups with d11 =1, d 21 =2
equal 0.946 and 0.054, respectively. We also use some non-drug intervention

~ 1 
~ 1
~
strategies to change the parameters:  =  ; k =  k  ; d1 = 1 changes to d1 = 0,
2
2 
~
d 2 = 1 changes to d 2 = 0; ~
r1 = 0.518, ~
r1 = 0.482 are changed from r1 = 0.946, r1

= 0.054, respectively. From Fig. 10, it is found that the influence trend of the three
parameters in Egypt on the transmission process is similar to that in South Korea.
To reduce the infection rate  , the infection batch size d, and the initial value of
active cases k, it is observed from Figures 9 and 10 that we need to further sufficiently
adopt some non-drug intervention strategies, such as travel restrictions, community
isolation, reducing parties, wearing masks, etc.

Discussion
In this research, we develop a Markov system to model the COVID-19
transmission process. To the best of our knowledge, the transmission of COVID-19
has been mainly studied by SIR models and their extensions in the existing research.
Our research represents the first time that the theory of Markov processes is used to
study such a problem. That is, we propose a new direction in the study of COVID-19
transmission. We believe that the methodology and results given in this paper will
open a new avenue to the study of COVID-19 transmission, and can motivate a series
of promising future research on various new mutations of COVID-19.
One merit of our Markov process for the COVID-19 transmission is that it
14

contains only four basic parameters: The infection rate  , the disappearing rate  ,
the infection batch size d , and the number of initial active cases, k . On the one
hand, by using these parameters we can describe the COVID-19 transmission process
in details. On the other hand, these parameters can be used to evaluate the
transmission process of COVID-19, and, therefore, they can be used to estimate the
control effect of non-drug intervention strategies, and even the impact of vaccine
application. Thus, these parameters act as a bridge between the intervention strategies
and the COVID-19 transmission process. This connection can effectively provide
guidance for decision making on using the non-drug intervention strategies.
The transmission of COVID-19 happens in a complex environment, where
different patients may have different infection ability. It is difficult to use a single
Markov process to describe such a problem. To better analyze this process, we divide
the random system of COVID-19 into several groups and treat each group as an
independent Markov process, as seen in Fig. 2. The transmission of COVID-19 within
a country or a city can be described by means of combining multiple Markov
processes of different groups. According to our empirical examples, we find that it is
enough to use only two groups with different parameters to describe the real
short-term change process of the countries and cities which have serious COVID-19
transmission. In addition, in the history of applications of Markov processes, our
research is the first one to combine multiple Markov processes to describe and
analyze a practical stochastic system.
In our study, we consider three values of the infection batch size, d: d  0 ,
15

d  1 , and d  2 , which represent three different levels of infection batch sizes.
When there are two groups in a country or city, we have three pairs: d1 =0, d 2 =1; d1
=0, d 2 =2; and d1 =1, d 2 =2. These three pairs represent low, medium and high levels
of infection batch sizes in the country or city, respectively. In our simulation process,
we find that the three infection batch sizes ( d  0 , d  1 , and d  2 ) are sufficient
for describing current COVID-19 transmission processes in the world. As the
COVID-19 mutates fast, when necessary we can consider more values of d (for
example, d =0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to express the more detailed levels of COVID-19
transmission.
The transmission intensity of COVID-19 in a country or city may change over
time, because of the adoption of the non-drug intervention strategies. This can be seen
from the change points of these parameters in the transmission process of COVID-19.
These change points quantitatively evaluate the control effect of non-drug
intervention strategies. The change points can be set in different groups, which
enables our simulation to well reflect the short-term transmission processes of
COVID-19 under non-drug intervention strategies.
Note that the simulation of the transmission process of COVID-19 by using our
Markov system can fit the actual situation of COVID-19 very well, and our method
can also be well applied to the prediction of transmission processes of COVID-19.
Such a forecast can be developed in two types: (1) No intervention strategy. We focus
on predicting the future transmission process using our simulation approach based on
changing the value of the initial infection size k, while keeping the other three
16

parameters (  ,  , and d ) unchanged. (2) The non-drug intervention strategies are
adopted. When there are non-drug intervention strategies are considered to implement,
we can roughly forecast the trend of the resulted future transmission process. This
trend can be used to help decision making on COVID-19 intervention strategies
within a country/city. Our Markov system and associated simulation technique can be
used to support controlling the transmission processes.
Currently, some countries have adopted the COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, our
future research efforts will be devoted to adapting the proposed approach to not only
evaluate the effect of the vaccines on the prevention of COVID-19, but also predict
the new transmission trend during the future process of COVID-19 mutation.

Fig. 7 The growth process of confirmed cases of Italy. The parameters of the observation period
in Italy were as follows: tc  12 . The parameters before tc are as follows: The average infection
rate is 0.049487386 (  ) and the average disappearing rate (  ) is 0.023181119. The initial
number of active cases ( k ) at the beginning of our observation period (Nov. 11) is determined as
613358. We then simulated the development of active cases in Italy during this period. In order to
1

obtain simulated results close to the real data, we infer that the weights ( r ) of the two groups d1
=1,

d 21 =2 equal 0.999 and 0.001, respectively. The parameters after tc are as follows: The

average infection rate (  ) is 0.030904889 and the average disappearing rate (  ) is 0.031409968.

the weights ( r ) of the two groups d1 =0,
