Abstract
We consider the SEIRS compartment epidemiology model suitable for predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemy in the extreme limiting case of no
acquired immunity. The disease-free and endemic fixed points are found and
their stability is analysed. The expression for the basic reproduction ratio is
obtained and discussed, emphasizing on its dependence on the model parameters. The threshold contact ratio is found which determines the possibility for
a stable disease-free fixed point existence. Numeric solution for the pandemy
evolution is also undertaken together with the approximate analytic solutions
for the early stage of the disease spread as well as as for its decay after the
rapid measures are undertaken. We analysed several possible scenarios for introducing and relaxing the quarantine measures. The cyclic “quarantine on”
and “quarantine off” strategy at fixed identification and isolation ratios fail to
reduce the lowering of the second and the consecutive waves, whereas this goal
is possible to achieve if the flexible increase of the identification and isolation
ratios is also involved.

1. Introduction and the model
The COVID-19 pandemy, originated in 2019 and continuing its run at the
moment of writing, is a serious multifaceted threat to mankind. Until this day,
there are 29 million registered cases and 924 thousands of deaths related to the
illness directly or indirectly [1]. With the absence of a vaccine, the only effective
way of slowing it down, and, consequently, decreasing load on a local medical
service undil medication is available, is introducing a set of quarantine measures. These are aimed on reduction of social contacts within a community and
comprise closing down of travel roots, sport and cultural mass events, putting
on restrictions on indoor factory works, shops, cafes, outdoor movement, etc.

While effective at the initial phases of a pandemy, these measures put a huge
strain on economy and normal functioning of a society. Therefore, one needs to
search for compromised measures that, on one hand, enable normal functioning
of a community, but on the other hand, keep the pandemy under control [2, 3, 4].
In this respect, development of suitable mathematical models that predict the
realistic dynamics of a pandemy depending on the level of imposed or lifted up
quarantine measures, plays a crucial role in developing a successful long-term
strategy to defeat the pandemy.
Modelling strategies related to COVID-19 are covered in detail in a number of recent reviews [5, 6, 7]. A wide set of general epidemiology models,
SIR, SEIR, SEIRU , SIRD, SLIAR, ARIM A and SIDART HE have been
adapted for this purpose, as discussed in Ref. [8]. Most studies make use of
SIR or SEIR epidemiology models modified to describe the peculiarities of
this disease. According to Carletti et al. [9], the dynamics of the COVID-19
outbreak belongs to the simple universality class of the SIR model and extensions thereof. There are also studies that use multi-group models to account for
population heterogeneity, e.g. the multi-group SEIR [10] and the SEIRA [11]
ones.
From the practical point of view, the analysis and prediction of the pandemy
outbreak in specific countries/regions is of much interest and there are many
papers devoted to such studies. In particular, the generalized SEIR model was
used to estimate the course of COVID-19 in Chile [12] and in the UK [13]. A simple mathematic modeling approach, based on the analysis and fitting of available
data, was used to track the outbreaks of COVID-19 in the US [14] and Brasil
[15]. The real-life modelling for the dissemination of the COVID-19 in Italy is
performed using the SEIR model that includes a network of its 107 provinces
with the use of precise data for the population mobility [16]. An extended
SEIRD model was used to describe the disease dynamics in Germany with
the parameter values identified by matching the model output to the officially
reported cases [17]. Two models of the SEIR type are used to evaluate the role
of the latency period of the infection in the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic
in China [18]. Besides the deterministic epidemiology models, the discrete-time
Markov chain model was proposed that directly incorporates stochastic behavior and for which parameter estimation is straightforward from available data
[19].
One of the characteristic (and rather unusual) feature of the COVID-19 pandemy is the abundance of asymptomatic cases and cases with mild symptoms, for
this and other peculiarities of the disease outbreak, see Ref. [20]. Such infected
individuals are unaware of being a host for the virus but may actively spread
it around. In a real-life situation, a number of asymptomatic infected individuals are unknown, but their role in the pandemy dynamics can be estimated in
mathematic modelling. Some modelling results predict that asymptomatic cases
may lead to both fast outbreak and large outbreak size [21]. The role of asymptomatic infected individuals is also discussed in detail in Ref. [22] in relation to
the epidemic dissemination in India. The effect can be lessened by performing
extensive and prompt identification of infected individuals by suitable testing
2

protocols, as well as their consequent isolation Ref. [9].
At early stages of the COVID-19 dissemination over the globe (beginning
of 2020), the main emphasis was put on its maximal possible slowing down, to
prevent an overload of local medical services. Understanding the early transmission dynamics and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial
for sustaining the disease dissemination in new areas [23, 24]. One of the first
measures, introduced both intra- and internationally, were travel restrictions,
as these should prevent the dissemination of a virus on a non-local scale. The
precise effects of these measures are, however, unknown, therefore, a number of
studies addressed them explicitly.
In particular, the simulations of a global network mobility model based on
air traffic in Europe [25] show that mobility networks of air travel can predict
the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the
outbreak. The effects of travel restrictions, as well as social distancing, hospitalization, quarantine and hygiene measures on short-and-long term dynamics
of the COVID-19 is examined and combined with data in South Africa during March-May 2020 [26]. By combining a global network mobility model with
a local epidemiology model the simulations predict the outbreak dynamics of
COVID-19 across Europe and the results suggest that an unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID-19, especially
in Central Europe, Spain, and France [25]. The impact of the other measures,
such as school closures, physical distancing, shielding of people aged 70 years or
older, and self-isolation of symptomatic cases, were investigated for the case of
the UK in Ref. [27]. It was suggested that to end the COVID-19 epidemic, social
distancing and wearing masks are absolutely crucial, along with the policy of
reducing the transmission period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as
possible through the efforts of the quarantine authorities [28].
The public-health policies to keep pandemic under control are also considered in terms of the SEIRA model in Ref. [11]. The outbreak dynamics of
COVID-19 in China and the United States was quantified by using a global
network model with a local epidemic SEIR model. When postulating that
the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific and the contact period is
behavior-specific, this network model predicts that without the massive political
mitigation strategies the United States would have faced a basic reproduction
number of about 5.3 and a nationwide pandemy peak [29]. This was found to
be a realistic prognosis in the following months after the publication date (May
2020). Scenarios of different containment measures and their impact were analyzed using the SEIR on a network of 107 provinces in Italy with known population mobility [16]. Results suggest that the mobility restrictions and reduction
of human-to-human interactions have reduced transmission by about 45%, resulting in the conclusion that verifiable evidence exists to support the planning
of emergency measures. Data collected over disease cases in Hubei province
were analysed using the Bayesian approach [30]. The estimates suggest an early
peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms.
Obtained results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals should be isolated quicker, to shorten the window of transmission in
3

the community. All these studies indicate that strict containment measures,
movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have
contributed to interrupt local transmission of COVID-19 [30, 28].
At further stages of the COVID-19 pandemy, it became quite clear that severe quarantine measures (while mostly effective in slowing a pandemy down and
preventing health systems overload) yield significant adverse economic consequences. As the COVID-19 pandemy seems to be a long-term affair, one should
seek for some compromises solutions of safe ways for relaxing and partial lifting
the quarantine measures. As suggested in Ref. [31], dynamic restrictions, with
intervals of relaxed social distancing, may provide a good option. The authors
of this study aimed on finding an ideal frequency and duration of the periods
of quarantine restrictions, mitigation and relaxation by using the multivariate
prediction model based on up-to-date transmission and clinical parameters in
16 countries. It was found that dynamic cycles of 50-day quarantine mitigation
followed by a 30-day relaxation reduced transmission, but cannot reduce hospitalizations below required limits. This, however, can be achieved by employing
cycles of 50-day suppression followed by a 30-day relaxation. This multi-country
analysis predicts that a combination of quarantine measures and their relaxation
can be employed as the effective strategy for COVID-19 pandemic control. Fusing models from epidemiology and network science, Block et al. [32] show how
to ease lockdown and slow infection dissemination by strategic modification of
people’s contacts. Using the approach of social network, they evaluated the
effectiveness of three distancing strategies such as: limiting interaction to a few
repeated contacts (social bubbles), looking for similarity across contacts, and
strengthening communities via triadic strategies. It was demonstrated that a
strategic social network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower and this provides
an evidence for effective social distancing mitigating negative consequences of
social isolation [32].
Adapted SEIR model was used to investigate the efficacy of two potential lockdown release strategies, focusing on the UK population as a test case
[13]. Ending quarantine for the entire population simultaneously was found as
a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more
reliable. However, lockdown should not be relaxed until the number of new
daily confirmed cases reaches a sufficiently low threshold. Using optimization
methods with adapted SEIR model, it was found that the optimal strategy is
to release approximately half the population 2-4 weeks from the end of an initial
infection peak, then wait another 3-4 months to allow for a second peak before
releasing everyone else. The extreme “on-off” strategy of releasing everyone,
but re-establishing lockdown if the number of cases raises again, is found to
be too risky. The worst-case scenario of a gradual release is found to be more
manageable than the worst-case scenario that used the threshold based on-off
strategy [13].
Lopéz et al. explore different post-confinement scenarios by using a stochastic modified SEIR model that accounts for the dissemination of infection during
the latent period and also incorporates time-decaying effects due to potential
4

loss of acquired immunity, people’s increasing awareness of social distancing and
the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Results being obtained suggest
that lockdowns should remain in place for at least 60 days to prevent epidemic
growth, as well as a potentially larger second wave of COVID-19 cases occurring within months. The best-case scenario should also gradually incorporate
workers in a daily proportion at most 50% higher than during the confinement
period. Decaying immunity and particularly awareness and behaviour have
99% significant effects on both the current wave of infection and on preventing
COVID-19 reemergence. Social distancing and individual non-pharmaceutical
interventions could potentially remove the need for lockdowns [33].
One can summarize the findings outlined above by saying that both actuality
and complexity of the COVID-19 pandemy call for employment of the modelling
of various types that take into account COVID-19 characteristic features. From
these we emphasize: (i) abundance of asymptomatic infected individuals; (ii)
absence of effective medication, and (iii) loss of acquired immunity and virus
mutation. While the (i) and (ii) are quite unambiguous, the feature (iii) calls
for some discussion. During the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak, it was
widely assumed that after recovery one acquires immunity and it will be safe
for such person to perform a social work in the places with a higher risk to be
infected. This belief led to a widely discussed concept of “immunity passports”
[34]. It, however, turned out that such immunity may last 3-4 months only,
as shown by immunodiagnostic tests [35, 36, 37], resulting in reported cases of
reinfections [38, 39, 35, 36, 37, 40]. Reported virus mutations [41, 42, 43, 44]
contribute an additional factor to the reinfection scenario. In this case the
classical concept of recovered and immunized individual is valid within the time
scale of 3-4 months only. There are, however, indications that the duration of
pandemy may be as much as several years and, on this time scale, one needs
to account for a loss of acquired immunity [33] and of mutation of a virus. In
this respect, it makes sense to consider the extreme case of complete lack of the
acquired immunity, as the most harsh scenario. This is done in this study.
The SEIRS compartmental model, suggested in this study and shown schematically in Fig. 1, contains four groups, marked via their respective fractions of
susceptible S, unidentified infected E, identified infected I and isolated R individuals. Group E contains individuals within incubation period of the disease,
asymptomatic patients and these with mild symptoms, they are the susceptible
individuals from group S infected with the contact rate β. The E individuals y
are transfered further to group I of identified infected individuals, those tested
positive via PCR or other tests, with the identification rate α. Then, identified
infected individuals are isolated (in hospital or in home) by transferring them to
the group R with the isolation rate δ. Therefore, the R group contains isolated
infected individuals rather then recovered ones, as in classical SEIR model.
Infected individuals that are not isolated yet, those from E and I groups, are
assumed to be contagious. All infected individuals, from the groups E, I and
R, regardless of their identification and isolation status, recover with the same
rate γ (accounts for lack of medication), and are transfered back to the group
S, where they can be infected again (accounts for complete lack of immunity).

assuming that the fraction of death cases with respect to the total population
is small.

The purpose of this study is to examine the stationary states and the time
evolution of such SEIRS model with the emphasis put on the influence of the
quarantine measures and their relaxation on pandemy dynamics. The study is
of a general type with no direct link to particular country/region or statistical
data of any sort. We, therefore, concentrate on features and tendencies as
predicted by this model and not on practical recommendations that can be
used straightaway. Section 2 contains analysis of the stationary states (fixed
points) for the model and analysis of their stability; in section 3 we discuss earlytime spread and the decay dynamics of the disease dissemination by combining
numerical and approximate analytic tools; in section 4 we consider the effects
for quarantine measures and their relaxation on the dynamics of the COVID-19
pandemy, especially on the height of the second wave of the disease, section 5
contains conclusions.
2. Fixed points and their stability
The stationary state (fixed points) for the SEIRS model is given as the
solution of the equation set:
−β(E + I)S + γ(1 − S) = 0

(5)

β(E + I)S − (γ + α)E = 0

αE − (γ + δ)I = 0

Substituting the first one into Eq. (5) and combining it with Eq. (9) one obtains

There are two fixed points. The disease-free (DF) fixed point is
S † = 1,

The crossover between two fixed points occurs at S ∗ = 1. As far as here the
disease dies out, one can associate the expression
β(γ + α + δ)
= R0
(γ + α)(γ + δ)

(18)

with the basic reproductive number R0 . It is symmetric with respect to the α
and δ and reduces to the β/γ when α = 0 (the SES model) or δ = 0 (the SE 0 S
model, where E 0 = E + I). At fixed γ, R0 is the function of three independent
model parameters, the contact β, identification α, and isolation δ rates. Full

It provides quantitative means on how exactly the infinitesimal decrease dβ < 0
of the contact rate and the infinitesimal increase of either identification dα > 0
or isolation dδ > 0 rates affect the change dR0 of the basic reproductive number.
In practical terms, both options have associated financial burden: quarantine
related economy losses for the first option; and the cost of extensive coverage
of population by medical tests (e.g. PCR) and the isolation costs (control of
home isolation and hospital care) for the second one. Exact monetary expenses
7

for both options depend on many economic and social details that are country
dependent, and their estimation are beyond this study. However, if known, these
can be used to obtain practical estimates for the economic efficiency of both
options of reduction of the basic reproductive number using Eq. (19). Another
point to mention is, that the relative, dβ
β , and not the absolute, dβ change of the
contact rate enters Eq. (19). This shows that more strict quarantine measures
(larger magnitude of dβ) are needed in the countries with initially high contact
rates β, as compared to those with a low contact rate, to achieve the same
reduction of the basic reproductive number R0 .
One may find certain “equivalence” between the effects of reduction of β and
on the increase of two other rates, α and δ, when imposing the the condition
that the basic reproduction number is unchanged, dR0 = 0. As follows from
Eq. (19), in this case

which simplifies

further to

if γ  α. In this oversimplified case, the relative infinitesimal
change of the contact rate is balanced by exactly the same relative change of
the identification/isolation rate to keep the same value of the basic reproductive
number R0 .
Let us find the regions in the parameter space {α, δ, β, γ}, where the DF and
EN fixed points exist, termed thereafter as the DF and EN regions, respectively.
These are shown in Fig. 2 as surface plots for all the fractions with respect to α
and δ build at a range of contact rates β. The curing rate is fixed at γ = 1/14
throughout this study assuming the average curing period of 14 days. The plots
are symmetric with respect to α and δ, as follows from the Eqs. (14)-(17). The
plot for S ∗ indicates that S ∗ < 1 (the EN fixed point) turns into the S † = 1
(the DF fixed point) at the crossover curve defined by
(γ + α)(γ + δ)
= 1.
β(γ + α + δ)

(21)

Therefore, the DF region point spans in between this curve and the α = δ = 1
point. The area of the DF region shrinks with the increase of β, as shown by
dashed regions in Fig. 3, and disappears at the critical value
βc =

(γ + 1)2
,
γ+2

(22)

for the contact rate. At γ = 1/14, this value is βc ≈ 0.554. At the higher
contact rate, β ≥ βc , a DF region disappears. The other plots, for E ∗ , I ∗
and R∗ , in Fig. 2 show the redistribution of the individuals between respective
compartments following changes in the identification α and the isolation δ rates.
These all cross the z = 0 plane at the same crossover curve (21) and are equal
to zero in the DF region.

Now we will proceed to the question of stability of the fixed points in their

(26)

For the fixed point to be stable, the real parts of all eigenvalues λi should be
negative. The first eigenvalue λ1 = −γ is obtained trivially from the FR (λ) = 0
equation and is the same and negative for both fixed points since curing rate γ
is always positive. The rest eigenvalues, λ2 , λ3 and λ4 , are the solutions of the
FSEI (λ) = 0 equation and differ for the cases of the DF and EN fixed points.
In particular, for the DF fixed point (13), the characteristic equation FSEI (λ) =
0 for λ2 , λ3 and λ4 , simplifies to

Hence, one of the eigenvalues, λ2 = −γ, is found easily from Eq. (27) and
is equal to λ1 and always negative. Two other eigenvalues, λ3 and λ4 , are
solutions of the FDF (λ) = 0 equation. The signs of their real parts of are
examined graphically for the simplified case of α = δ to enable visualisation of
the analysis via 3D plots. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The plot on the left
shows the discriminant D of the square equation FDF (λ) = 0, which is found
to be positive at all β and α = δ if both rates are contained within the [0 : 1]
interval. Therefore, both λ3 and λ4 are real. The plot on the right shows λ3

The sign of Q is examined graphically for the simplified case of α = δ and
is found to be positive within the whole EN region, as shown in Fig. 5, on the

are complex, and we will be interested in their real parts only. The respective

The real parts of the eigenvalues λi can be found from here according to Eq. (32)
and these are shown within the EN region in the right plot of Fig. 5. One can
see that λ2 and the real parts of both λ3 and λ4 are all negative, hence the EN
fixed point is stable in the EN region.
To conclude this section, we found two fixed points, the disease-free and the
endemic one and the respective regions of parameter space where they exist,
these are defined by the basic reproductive number R0 . Both fixed points are
found to be stable within their respective regions according to the linear stability
analysis. The important outcome of this analysis is that the critical value βc
(22) exists such that the disease-free fixed point exist only if a contact rate
β < βc . This indicates that, within the SEIR model suggested in this study,
the contact rate plays a crucial role in the possibility of the system to achieve a
disease-free stationary state.

3. Numeric solution and its fits at various stages of an outbreak
Stationary states of the epidemiology model describe its asymptotic behaviour at large times, and the possibility of reaching a DF state is of most
importance here. However, the time-resolved dynamics of the disease dissemination is even of higher importance, as it is directly related to the lives losses
and to the load put on medical service. In particular, monitoring the initial
phase of the dissemination [46, 17, 30, 25, 29, 23] helps to decide on a required
measures to bring its dissemination down [22, 10, 27, 6, 9].
The SEIRS model, defined via the set of equations (1)-(4), has no exact
analytic solution for its dynamics, but we will attempt to find a suitable approximate one. We will write the equation for the total fraction of infected
individuals I 0 = E + I + R in the following form
I˙0 = β(I 0 − R)(1 − I 0 ) − γI 0

(36)

One can see that at R = 0 this equation reduces to the one for the SI 0 S model
which has an exact solution. If R 6= 0, the Eq. (36) may be solvable if the
fraction of isolated individuals R is some simple known function of I 0 .
To look for suitable choices for such function, we performed numerical integration of Eqs. (1)-(4). It is done via the second-order integrator

X(t + ∆t) = X(t) + Ẋ(t)∆t + Ẍ(t)∆t2
2

(37)

for each fraction X = {S, E, I, R}, which is applied iteratively starting form
the initial state, S(0), E(0), I(0) and R(0), with the time step ∆t. The latter
is chosen equal to one day. The equations are coupled, as far as both the first
derivatives Ẋ, given by Eqs. (1)-(4), and the second derivatives

at time instance t depend on all variables S, E, I and R at the same instance
t. It has been checked that the third-order integrator does not provide any
evident improvement in accuracy as compared to the second-order one. To
simplify analysis of numeric solution, we exploit the fact that α and δ enter
expression for R0 (18) in a symmetric way and, therefore, we consider the same
simplified case of α = δ as above. The numeric integration can, obviously, be
perforemd at any values of α and δ.
Let us consider the early-stage dissemination of the disease from the almost
healthy initial state, S(0) = 0.999, E(0) = 0.001 and I(0) = R(0) = 0, first.
The total number of initially infected individuals, brought into the system from
somewhere outside, is I 0 (0) = 0.001 or 0.1% of total populations then. The
numeric integration is performed at various rates β and α = γ. To look for

a suitable function that relates R to E 0 , the time evolution of both fractions
was presented as the scatter plots, see Fig. 6. As is seen in the plot, the linear
function
R(t) ≈ k(β, α, δ)I 0 (t)
(42)
provides a very good fit at early times (t < 30) for the case of β = 0.5 and a wide
range of α = δ rates. Fig. 6 contains also the fitting results for the coefficient
k(β, α, δ) at various α = δ. Similar findings obtained at other values of β lead
to the approximate fitting function for k(β, α, δ) of the following form

Its accuracy is found to be reasonable good in a wide interval from β = 0.1 to

Fig. 7, where the approximate expression (43) is plotted via dashed lines and
the results for k(β, α, δ) obtained by numeric integration – via squares.
The approximate expression for R(t) given by Eqs. (42) and (43), can be
substituted into Eq. (36) now resulting in the equation
I˙0 = β 0 I 0 (1 − I 0 ) − γI 0

(44)

where β 0 = β(1 − k(β, α, δ)). One recognizes now the equation for the SI 0 S
model with the scaled contact rate β 0 . It is lower than β as far as part of
infected individuals are isolated in the group R and do not infect susceptible
individuals via social contacting. The solution of this equation is well known

The approximate solution (45) is found to reproduce the early-time dynamics
of I 0 (t) from the almost healthy state (I 0 (0) = 0.001) rather well and in a wide
range of β and α = δ. This is demonstrated in Fig. 8 for the case of β = 0.5
and α = δ that range from 0 (where the approximate solution is exact) to 0.6.
Let us now consider the case when the disease decays from the all-infected
state with S(0) = 0.001 and E(0) = I(0) = R(0) = 0.333 because of a suitable
choice of the model parameters (e.g. as the result of the quarantine measures,
massive testing and efficient isolation of infected individuals). This, of course, is
possible only if the set of β and α = δleads to the reproductive number R0 ≤ 1,
where the latter is given by Eq. (18). Using fit to the numeric integration data,
we found that the decay dynamics of I 0 (t) can be approximated well by the

as demonstrated in Fig. 9 for the case of β = 0.2 and α = δ ranging from 0.1 to
1. At this value for β, R0 crosses 1 at α = δ ≈ 0.29 and the exponential decay
(46) is very accurate, indeed, at α = δ ≥ 0.29 (see respective plots in Fig. 9).
The expression (46) is the solution of the equation
I˙0 = −γI 0

(47)

which is obtained from Eq. (36) at β = 0. This indicates that the γI 0 term
prevails over the β(I 0 − R)(1 − I 0 ) one for the decay dynamics of the SEIRS
model considered here. Therefore, if the reproductive number R0 ≤ 1, then the
disease can be brought down more quickly only by the increase of a curing rate
γ (by finding effective medication), but not by changing the other parameters
related to the contact, identification and isolation rates of infected individuals.
As an attempt to fit the evolution of I 0 (t) both at the early times of an
outbreak and at it saturation in an endemic state, we used the modified logistic
function
∗
−n
I 0 (t) = I 0 [1 + exp(−c(t − t0 ))]
(48)
suggested by Pongkitivanichkul et al. [46] as the result of their analysis of the
epidemic data reported by the World Health Organization, and motivated by
∗
the renormalization group framework. Here I 0 = 1 − S ∗ , where S ∗ is given by
Eq. (14), c and t0 define a time scale for the I 0 (t) evolution, whereas n is termed
in Ref. [46] as an asymmetry in the modified logistic function, which determines
the characteristic of the epidemic at an early stage and is found either equal
or less than one. The fits, performed for the numerical solution of the SEIRS
model considered here, are shown at β = 0.5 and a range of α = δ from 0 to
0.6 as black dashed lines in the left frame of Fig. 10. The analytic form (48) is

plateau is reached, at α = δ > 0. The dependence of the fitting parameters I 0 ,
c, t0 and n on α = δ are shown in the right frame of the same plot. Leaving
∗
out the amplitude I 0 , discussed above, let us note that the value of c is found
inside the interval from 0.4 to 0.8 without obvious systematic trend, whereas
the characteristic time t0 increases from about 19 to 30 days when α = β raised
from 0 to 0.6. The strongest dependence is found for the asymmetry n, which
decreases from 1 down to 0.25 and seems to saturate at larger α = β. This
result is revelant in the context of the role of this parameter for description of
the maturing and the growth-dominated phase of the pandemy, as discussed in
Ref. [46]. Deeper analysis is, however, beyond this report and will the subject
of the following studies.
To conclude this section, we performed numerical integration of the SEIRS
model here and found that, at early stage of an outbreak, the fraction R of
isolated infective individuals is linearly proportional to the total fraction I 0 =
E + I + R of infected individuals. This enabled us to map the SEIRS model
onto the SI 0 S one with effective contact rate β 0 < β and obtain the approximate
analytic solution for the SEIS model valid at the early time of the outbreak.
The decay dynamics is found to be dominated by the recovery rate γ, which
is fixed in this model. The evolution of I 0 (t) in the whole time interval can be
fitted well with the modified logistic function of Pongkitivanichkul et al. [46]
leading to the possibility of further analysis of the outbreak merits.
4. The effects of quarantine measures and of their relaxation
In the previous section we considered both the early-time dissemination and
the decay of the disease as described by the SEIRS model that reflects char17

acteristic features of the COVID-19 virus. Numeric solution (37) is a quick and
efficient way to do such analysis for any particular choice of the model parameters β, α, δ and γ. On a top of this, we also obtained approximate analytic
solutions (45) and (46) at α = δ for the early-time dissemination, for the decay
regimes and the fit to the modified logistic function (48). This analysis is performed assuming that the evolution of the system occurs at fixed values for all
model parameters β, α, δ and γ. The real-life situation is rather different, as
the governments and societies react dynamically on the virus dissemination by
undertaking appropriate measures. The latter can be modelled via the dynamic
changes of the model parameters in a course of the disease dissemination.
The main problem faced by all countries during the initial stages of the
COVID-19 pandemic was to slow it down, which will reduce the strain on the
medical care system. This was tackled by means of a number of quarantine
measures, both locally (closure of sporting and cultural mass attendance events,
hotel service, social distancing, etc.) and globally (cancellation of international
flight and train services, closure of tourism, etc.).[25, 26, 25, 27, 28, 11, 29, 16,
30, 30, 28].
However, at the subsequent stages of the pandemic, it became evident that
the quarantine measures have a number of serious economic implications. Therefore, the focus shifted gradually to addressing the questions when and to which
extend the quarantine measures can be relaxed to revive economy but, simultaneously, to keep the dissemination of the disease under control [31, 32, 13, 33].
The effects of a quarantine and of it relaxation will be discussed for the case of
the SEIRS model in this section. We must disclaim and remind again that this
model reproduces the extreme case when no immunity can be acquired against
the disease, and that we do not aim on reproducing any particular case (country,
town) or provide practical aids with numbers. Instead, we examine the general
effects and trends related to quarantine depending on the model parameters set.
We start from discussing the effect of introducing permanent quarantine
measures on the dynamics of the disease dissemination. The following algorithm is used. We start from the state with a small fraction of unidentified
infected individuals E0 (supposedly brought to the unaware community from
outside), whereas forth I and E are initially equal to zero. At early times
the dissemination of disease is unrestricted and is characterised by a “normal”
contact rate β, being characteristic for a given community. When, at a certain
˙ reaches the
time instance, the fraction of newly identified individuals per day, I,
quarantine threshold value of ∆, the community is switched into a quarantine
mode characterised by a lower contact rate β2 < β.
For reading convenience, we display all fractions in % of the total population. We present the results for three separate cases of α = δ = 0.05, 0.1 and
0.2, which model poor, intermediate and high identification and isolation rates,
respectively. All other parameters, E0 = 0.001%, β = 0.25, β2 = 0.05 − 0.25
and ∆ = 0.01%, are the same in all cases. We also remark that the findings are
similar at other values of β if the other rates are scaled accordingly. For the
sake of brevity, we display the dynamics of the isolated infected fraction R only,
which is important as an estimate of a strain put on the medical care system.
18

The unidentified infected fraction, E, cannot be evaluated in a real life, whereas
the identified infected fraction, I, can be interpreted as the “transit” state for
the individuals that are identified as infected but not isolated yet and, hence,
of a lesser importance. In any case, the behaviour of both E and I is found to
follow closely that of R.
The top plot in Fig. 11 shows the case of a low identification and isolation
rates, α = δ = 0.05 and various quarantine levels, from a very strict one,
β2 = 0.05 = β/5, to a no quarantine being introduced, β2 = 0.25 = β. As
one can see in this plot, the decay of the R fraction to zero at long times is
possible only at a very strict quarantine measures, β2 = 0.05. Twofold increase
of the identification and isolation rates to α = δ = 0.1 (see, middle plot in
Fig. 11), enables to achieve this at less strict quarantine measures characterised
by a higher contact rate β2 = 0.1. Yet another twofold increase of α = δ up to
0.2 (shown in a bottom plot in Fig. 11) increases threshold value of β2 further,
up to 0.15. This demonstrates that the strictness of quarantine measures in
the SEIRS model is inversely proportional to the identification and isolation
rates. Let us also note that at β2 < β2,th , the dynamics of the R changes very
weakly upon further decrease of β2 . This indicates that imposing quarantine
measures stronger than these characterised byβ2,th has no point, as it only
increases associated financial burden with no real benefit of better control the
pandemy.
Exact expression for the threshold value, β2,th , at which R has a zero stationary state, can be obtained from the equation R0 = 1, where R0 is given by
Eq. (18)
(γ + α)(γ + δ)
.
(49)
β2,th (α, δ) =
γ+α+δ
Given that this expression is symmetric with respect to α and δ, we analyse
β2,th (α, δ) as a function of one of its arguments while another is fixed plus the
special case of α = δ which is exploited throughout this study. This is done
in Fig. 12, and we see that the decrease of one of its arguments (in this case
this is δ) below 0.2 decreases β2,th (α, δ)essentially regardless of the value of the
other argument. With respect to this, the special case of α = δ turns to be
quite optimal, as: (i) the curve for β2,th (α, δ = α) is relatively high approaching
the case when one of the arguments equals to 1 and (ii) the value of both
arguments can be kept balanced without much demand on either identification
or isolation rate to stay very high. In the special case α = δ, the dependence
of β2,th (α, δ = α) on α is close to linear. Indeed, the expansion of Eq. (49) at
small γ yields linear dependence in α
β2,th (α, δ) ≈

This expression provides simple means of evaluation of minimum required quarantine measures depending on the current identification and isolation rates.
We will switch now to the issues when and how the quarantine measures
can be relaxed while keeping the disease dissemination under control, where we

measures, the disease dissemination decays and I˙ ≤ , where  can be termed as
the quarantine relaxation threshold, then the quarantine is relaxed. Relaxation
means reversion of the contact rate back to β, a “normal life” one.
We concentrate here on the resulting dynamics for the R fraction depending
on the choice for  for the same set of parameters: β = 0.25, α = δ = 0.2 and a
range of β2 as shown previously in the bottom frame of Fig. 11. The results are
shown in Fig. 13. Top plot in this figure represents relatively early relaxation
of quarantine measures,  = 10−3 %. This results in a wave-like oscillations
for R with no time intervals where R drops essentially below 0.1%. With the
decrease of  down to 10−5 %, such intervals appear and are of approximate
duration of 50 − 60 days (see, middle plot in the same figure). With the further
decrease of  down to 10−7 %, their duration increase about twice, to about 100
days (see, bottom plot there). Therefore, lowering the quarantine relaxation
threshold  about two orders of magnitude increases the length of the almost
disease-free time intervals about twice. During these intervals, the economics
works normally and can be essentially revived. Let us also remark that the
threshold value for quarantine contact rate β2,th = 0.156 for the given choice of
α = δ = 0.2. And, as follows from the middle and bottom all plots in Fig. 13,
duration of the almost disease-free intervals is maximal when β2 ≈ 0.8β2,th
and decays when β2 decreases. This indicates, that, at least within this model,
an optimal quarantine contact rate β2 exists such that it leads to the longest
disease-free interval when the quarantine measures are relaxed. This contact
rate is lower but close to the threshold contact rate β2,th .
The height of the second and all the following waves for the disease dissemination in Fig. 13 is found to be the same. This is the consequence of the fact,
that the only way to bring the disease down in the SEIRS model is to transfer
infected individuals into the R fraction, where they are isolated and do not dis-

semination infection further. That is why the values of the α and δ rates should
be sufficiently high, as far as they drive this transfer. From the practical point
of view, if the following waves of a pandemy appear, then one seeks the ways
to bring their height down. The first way to achieve this is to take into account

22

the immunity factor (permanent or temporal), acquired either naturally or via
vaccination in a course of the disease dissemination. Immunised individuals will
be resilient to the disease and will not dissemination it further. This factor is
beyond the scope of this study and is a subject for a future work. Another
ways of bringing the consequent waves down is to dynamically adjust quarantine threshold and/or the identification and isolation rates. These approaches
are discussed below.

Figure 14: Top frame: time evolution of R(t) in the periodic “quarantine on” – “quarantine
off” scenario at fixed α = δ = 0.2 using dynamic changes in  according Eq. (51) at various
k∆ indicated in the figure. Bottom frame: the same but using fixed  and dynamic change of
α = δ according to Eq. (52) with the parameters provided in the figure.

The following procedure is used for dynamic adjustment of the quarantine
threshold ∆. The same basic algorithm is used as discussed with relation to
Fig. 13. On a top of that, the quarantine threshold ∆n for the nth wave obey
the geometric progression
∆0
∆n = n ,
(51)
k∆
∆1 = 0.01%, as used above, and k∆ is the threshold factor. This means that
for each subsequent wave the quarantine measures are introduced earlier than
23

for the previous one. The result of numeric solution is shown in the top frame
of Fig. 14 at various threshold factors k∆ . One can see that the height of the
second and of the following waves decrease and the effect is stronger for larger
k∆ . At large times, however, ∆ → 0 and the quarantine must be introduced
instantly with no periods of its relaxation. Therefore, this approach may be
interpreted as a bit artificial or, at least, impractical. The other way to bring
the following waves down is by dynamic adjustment of the identification α and
isolation δ rates. This might be more realistic, as it reflects the fact that with the
progress of the pandemy community became more aware of it and more relevant
tests are developed and available, as well as more hospital space in allocated for
isolation of infected individuals. Following previous findings, especially these
shown in Fig. 12, we consider the case of δ = α as the most optimal one and
restrict our analysis to it. Dynamic adjustment of relevant rates are given by
logistic function:

α(t) = αmin + (αmax − αmin ) 1 − e−t/τ , δ(t) = α(t)
(52)
where αmin = α(0), αmax = α(∞) and τ is the time constant that provides a
timescale for the increase of α and δ. The case of αmin = 0 and αmax = 0.4
is shown in the bottom of Fig. 14 at various time constants τ . As one can
see, prompt reaction of a community (τ ≤ 90 days) completely eliminates the
second and the following waves, whereas the sloppy reaction with higher τ leads
to wide and high second wave, which height is comparable to (at τ = 150 days)
or higher then (at τ = 160 days) the first wave. One can see that quite moderate
increase of τ from 130 to 160 results in quite dramatic increase of the second
wave height. One can conclude that the dependence of the height for the second
and the following waves of the disease dissemination depends non-linearly on the
model parameters related to identification and isolation of infected individuals.
Consequently, slow and inefficient testing measures can be dangerous resulting
in broad and high second and the following waves of the disease dissemination.
5. Conclusions
We propose here the SEIRS compartmental epidemiology model that is
based on such features of the COVID-19 disease as: abundance of unidentified
(asymptomatic or with mild symptoms) infected individuals, the absence of
a vaccine, existence of a few known variants of the virus and their possible
mutation, and reported cases of reinfection after recovery from the disease.
Therefore, the model contains four compartments: of susceptible S, unidentified
infected E, identified infected I and isolated infected R individuals. All types
of infected individuals recover only in a natural way with the same average
recovery time and with the possibility of the reinfection. Model parameters
involve: the contact β, identification α and isolation δ rates, as well as fixed
curing rate γ.
We found two stationary states (fixed points) for the set of differential equations of the model: the disease-free and the endemic one. They exist in their
24

respective restricted regions of the parameter space because of the limitations
for all fractions to stay positive and do not exceed 1. The linear stability analysis indicates the stability of both fixed points within their respective regions.
Simple expressions obtained for the fractions S ∗ , E ∗ , I ∗ and R∗ in the endemic
fixed point enable to discuss the ways to bring the number of infected individuals in a stationary state down via changing the model parameters. This can be
achieved by lowering the contact rate β and/or by the increase of the identification α and isolation δ rates. However, if β equals or exceeds the critical value
βc , the disease-free fixed point can not be achieved at any combination of α and
δ. This justifies the need for lowering the contact rate β (quarantine measures)
to control the dissemination of COVID-19.
Analytic solution of the SEIRS is not possible, therefore, we employed
numeric solution to examine the dynamics of the disease dissemination at various
sets of model parameters. Numeric solution provides an evidence that, during
the early-time evolution, the R fraction is linearly proportional to the E fraction.
This simplifies the differential equations by bringing the model to the class of the
SIS model with rescaled contact rate β 0 and enables an approximate analytic
solution for the SEIRS model at early times of its spread. Similar analysis
is performed for the decay of the disease, given suitable choice of the model
parameters. The exponential decay is found, governed solely by the curing rate
γ. Both approximate solutions do agree well with the results of the numeric one,
within their respective regions of validity. Both approximate solutions provide
simple analytic expressions for the estimates of system dynamics at early stage
and at its decay. The numeric solution can also be fitted well by a modified
logistic function, as suggested in some previous works.
The effects of a quarantine and of its relaxation are modelled via step-wise
switching between the “normal life” contact rate β and that during a quarantine,
β2 < β. The numeric solution can be used only in this case. The switch
into a quarantine mode is performed if the fraction of newly identified infected
individuals per unit time, I˙ exceeds a quarantine threshold ∆. At fixed values
of α and δ, the contact rate β2,th exist, such that the disease decays only if
the contact rate is lower than β2,th . It increases with the increase of the α
and δ rates. Therefore, less strict quarantine measures are possible if more
extensive testing of population and prompt isolation of infected individuals are
undertaken. However, we also found that the optimal quarantine contact rate
β2 is about 0.8β2,th and further decrease of β does not lead to faster decay of
disease. This indicates no need for over-strong quarantine measures.
If, as the result of quarantine measures, I˙ is reduced below  (the quarantine
relaxation threshold), then we restore the normal life contact rate β. Application of this algorithm of periodic switching on/off of a quarantine results in
the wave-like behaviour for all the fractions of infected individuals. At fixed
values of α, δ and of both thresholds ∆ and , the waves height are determined
by the quarantine threshold ∆ only, whereas their separation in time – by its
relaxation threshold . Therefore, one way to suppress the consequent waves of
the disease in the SEIRS model is: to fix identification α and isolation δ rates
and to decrease ∆ (undertake quarantine measures earlier) each time a quar25

antine is renewed. More realistic situation is, however, when both α and δ are
small at the beginning of the pandemy (no testing algorithms, equipment and
required chemicals available) but gradualy increase thereafter until the reasonable saturation for their values is reached. We modelled this scenario assuming
quarantine on/off switch with fixed thresholds ∆ and  and the time-dependent
α and δ rates using logistic function. Is is found that the heights of the second and of following waves of the disease dissemination in such scenario depend
critically on the time scale of the growth of α and δ. The dependence is rather
non-linear, where a small increase of the time scale results in dramatic increase
of the waves’ height with the possibility of the second wave to be broader and
higher than the first one. This shows the importance of the need for prompt
introduction of testing and increasing the hospital level of readiness to avoid the
wide and high second and following waves of the pandemy.
We did not adjust or fine-tune intentionally this modelling study for particular country/region/town and preferred to stand on rather general grounds.
In this way the study concentrates on the general effects and disease behaviour
patterns that are found at certain set of model parameters. It, of course, can be
tuned for some special case given the relevant statistical data is available, but,
in our view, the cellular automaton, geography-based modelling and networkbased approaches suit this purpose much better. We see, however, the option
for a synergy between the SEIRS model developed here and above mentioned
approaches and plan to do this in following studies.
