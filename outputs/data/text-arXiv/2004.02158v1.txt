COVID-19, since emerged in Wuhan, China, has been a major concern due to its high
infection rate, leaving more than one million infected people around the world. Huge number of
studies tried to reveal the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 compared to the SARS-CoV-1, in order to
suppress this high infection rate. Some of these studies showed that the mutations in the SARSCoV-1 Spike protein might be responsible for its higher affinity to the ACE2 human cell receptor.
In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo sampling to compare the
binding affinities of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2. We found
that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 stronger than SARS-CoV by 7 kcal/mol, due to enhanced
electrostatic interactions. The major contributions to the electrostatic binding energies are resulting
from the salt-bridges formed between R426 and ACE2-E329 in case of SARS-CoV and K417 and
ACE2-D30 for SARS-CoV2. In addition, there is no significant contribution from a single mutant
to the binding energies. However, these mutations induce sophisticated structural changes that
enhance the binding energies. Our results also indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely a lab
engineered virus.

A highly infectious strain of the SARSCoV known as SARS-CoV-2 emerged in
Wuhan China and was first reported on the 31st
of December 2019, according to the World
Health Organization (WHO)1. This strain has
already resulted in more than 1 million
infections and over 60,000 deaths all over the
world. Previous studies conducted on the first
SARS-CoV strain showed that the most likely
mechanisms by which the virus interacted with
a cell, were mediated by the receptor binding
domain (RBD) on the S protein, which binds
the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2)2.
Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 was proposed
to garner entry to the cells through the
RBD.3،4،5 However, there are several mutations
identified in the RBD, which include: 𝑉404 →
𝐾417,
𝑅426 → 𝑁439,
𝑌442 → 𝐿455,
𝐿443 → 𝐹456,
𝐿460 → 𝐹473, 𝐿472 →
𝐹486,
𝐿479 → 𝑄493,
𝐷480 → 𝑆456,
𝑌484 → 𝑄498, 𝑇487 → 𝑁501, according to
the latest resolved structure using Cryoelectron microscopy.5 Furthermore, another
study using comparative genomics identified
only 5 mutations and stated that RBD does not
contain insertion or deletion.6 The 𝑉404 →
𝐾417 mutation balances the 𝑅426 → 𝑁439
since they include the addition and removal of
positively charged amino acids respectively.
However, the 𝐷480 → 𝑆456 mutation
removes a negatively charged amino acid and
is expected to make the electrostatic surface
potential of SARS-CoV-2 more positive.
In this work, we study the binding
energies between the ACE2 receptor and the
Spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 viruses using Monte Carlo (MC) sampling
and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
To study the interactions between the
SARS-CoV and the ACE2, the crystal
structure 2AJF,1 which includes the receptor
binding domain RBD is MD optimized using
openMM software.9-14. Then, the optimized
structure is inputted to MCCE (Multi
Conformer Continuum Electrostatic)

software16 to sample the protonation states of
the amino acids using Monte Carlo. The
electrostatic interactions between the different
amino acids’ conformers are calculated by
solving Possion Boltzmann equation using

2

DELPHI.17 The generated conformers’
occupancies based on Boltzmann distributions
are used to calculate the electrostatic and van
der Waals interactions between the amino
acids in the SARS-CoV and the ACE2.
However, to study the interactions between
the SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2, we
constructed the following mutants (V404K,
R426N, Y442L, L443F, F460Y, L472F,
N479Q, D480S, Y484Q, T487N) based on the
cryoEM structure PDB ID 6M17.7 The
mutations were performed by replacing the
sidechains in the native structures with the
proper sidechains of the mutants using MCCE.
Several confirmations of the sidechains were
created to void van der Waals clashes. The
sidechain conformers with the highest
Boltzmann occupancies were then MD
optimized. The MCCE was then used to
calculate the binding energies based on the
optimized structures.
The electrostatic potential maps of
SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 were
calculated using Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann
Solver (APBS)16 (Figure1. a, b, and c). The
ACE2 exhibit a negative electrostatic potential
at the RBD (Figure1. c), while both SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 show positive
potentials. However, the potential observed for
SARS-CoV-2 is more positive, which will
result in a greater electrostatic attraction
between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2. This could
be explained by the replacement of the
negatively charged amino acid Asp by a
neutral Ser (D480S).
The optimized structure of SARS-CoV shows
salt-bridges formed between SARS-CoVR426 and ACE2-E329, which dominates the
electrostatic interactions with the ACE2. This
salt-bridge is replaced by another salt-bridge
formed between CoV-2-K404 and ACE2-D30
in SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2). However, the
CoV2-K404/ACE2-D30 salt-bridge has more
favorable electrostatic. attractions by 1.4
Kcal/mol (Table 1). The total electrostatic

interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 and the
ACE2 are stronger by 3 Kcal/mol than SARSCoV (Table S1). The contribution from the
mutants themselves to the electrostatic binding
energies is very small (Table S1).

SARS-CoV (top) and SARS-CoV-2 (bottom).
The secondary structures of the spike protein
and the ACE2 are shown in magenta and
green respectively. Key residues are labeled
and shown in cyan. The salt-bridges formed
between R426 and E329 in SARS-CoV and
K404 and D30 in SARS-CoV-2 are shown in
black dots.

The major electrostatic contributions are
observed for the R426/E329 salt-bridge for
SARS-CoV and K404/D30 for SARS-CoV-2.
Table S1 includes more information about the
electrostatic and van derWaalsinteractions
between SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2

Furthermore, these mutants induce
structural changes that increase the favorable
van der Waals interactions in SARS-CoV-2.
The maximum van der Waals attractions of 1.6 Kcal/mol are observed between CoVY457 and ACE2-T27 for SARS-CoV, while
for SARS-CoV-2 the maximum attraction is 2.1 Kcal/mol observed between CoV2-D491
and CoV2-K353 (Table 1). The total van der
Waal’s contribution to the binding energy in
case of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than SARSCoV by ~ 4Kcal/mol. In total, the electrostatic
and van derWaalsattraction between the
SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 is stronger by ~7
Kcal/mol than the SAR-CoV.
Several studies proposed that increased
virulence of SARS-CoV-2 is due to the
increased binding affinity to the ACE2
receptor.3,6,7 Yan et al., proposed that mutation
𝑉404 → 𝐾417 may result in higher binding
affinity due to the salt bridge between K417
and D30, while the 𝑅426 → 𝑁439 mutation
weaken the interaction with E329. However,
our simulations show that the 𝑉404 → 𝐾417
mutation increases the binding affinities by
favorable electrostatic energies more than the
energy loss induced by 𝑅426 → 𝑁439
mutation. Additionally, mutation 𝐿472 →

𝐹486 was proposed to weaken van der Waals
contact with Met 82 of ACE2. On the contrary,
the relaxed structure shows a van
derWaalsattraction of -1.32 Kcal/mol.7 The
structural changes induced by these mutations
likely confer stability to CoV-2 as it binds to
ACE2. This agrees with the study of Ortega et
al.,8 where they found that two main residues
(479 and 487) have been associated with
human ACE2 recognition. They further found
a higher number of residues in the CoV-2
capping loops and attributed the more
favorable binding affinity of -15.7 Kcal/mol as
opposed to -14.1 Kcal/mol for CoV.8
Based on our calculations, there is no
significant contribution from a single mutant
to the binding energies between the SARS and
the ACE2. However, these mutations induce
sophisticated structural changes that enhance
the electrostatic and van der Waals binding
energies (Table S1). These results might also
support the idea that it is unlikely that the
SARS-CoV-2 is lab engineered but rather a
result of a biological evolution.18
