Abstract
Background. Forecasting the time of forthcoming pandemic reduces the impact of diseases by
taking precautionary steps such as public health messaging and raising the consciousness of
doctors. With the continuous and rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19,
statistical and outbreak prediction models including various machine learning (ML) models are
being used by the research community to track and predict the trend of the epidemic, and also in
developing appropriate strategies to combat and manage its spread.
Methods. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of various ML approaches including
Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor and Artificial Neural Network in
predicting the COVID-19 outbreak in the epidemiological domain. We first apply autoregressive
distributed lag (ARDL) method to identify and model the short and the long-run relationships of
the time-series COVID-19 datasets. That is, we determine the lags between a response variable
and its respective explanatory time series variables as independent variables. Then, the resulting
significant variables concerning their lags are used in the regression model selected by the ARDL
for predicting and forecasting the trend of the epidemic.
Results. Statistical measures i.e., Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used for model accuracy. The values of MAPE
for the best selected models for confirmed, recovered and deaths cases are 0.407, 0.094 and 0.124
respectively, which falls under the category of highly accurate forecasts. In addition, we computed
fifteen days ahead forecast for the daily deaths, recover, and confirm patients and the cases
fluctuated across time in all aspect. Besides, the results reveals the advantages of ML algorithms
for supporting decision making of evolving short term policies.

Introduction
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as one of the
most devastating respiratory disease since the 1918 HIN1 influenzas pandemic, infecting millions
of people globally (Tuli et al. 2020). The cumulative incidence of the virus is continually and
rapidly increasing globally. At the early stage of the outbreak, it is important to have a clear
understanding of the disease transmission and its dynamic progression, so that relevant agencies
and organizations can make informed-decisions and enforce appropriate control measures.
Generally, capturing the transmission dynamics of a disease over time can provide insights into its
progression, and show whether the outbreak control measures are effective and able to reduce the
impact of the disease on a community (Kucharski et al. 2020).
Access to real-time data and effective application of outbreak prediction or forecasting models are
central to obtaining insightful information regarding the transmission dynamics of the disease and
its consequences. Moreover, every outbreak has its unique transmission characteristics that are
different from the other outbreaks, which raises the question of how standards prediction models
would perform in delivering accurate results. In addition, various factors including the number of
known and unknown variables, differences in population/behavioural complexity in various
geopolitical areas, and the variations in containment strategies increase the uncertainty of
prediction models (Ardabili et al. 2020). As a result, it is challenging for standard epidemiological
models such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) to provide reliable results for long-term
predictions. Therefore, it is important to not only study the relationship between the components
of the outbreak datasets but also evaluate the effectiveness of the common disease prediction
models.
In recent months, there have been a handful of works that try to understand the spread of COVID19, especially using statistical approaches. For instance, Kucharski et al. explored a combination
of stochastic transmission model and four datasets that captured the daily number of new cases,
the daily number of new internationally exported cases, the proportion of infected passengers on
evacuation flight and the number of new confirmed cases, to estimate the transmission dynamics
of the disease over some time (Kucharski et al. 2020).
In another study, a machine learning-based model is applied to analyse and predict the growth of
COVID-19 (Tuli et al. 2020). The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of using iterative
weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution when developing a prediction
solution. Lin et al., presented a conceptual model designed for the COVID-19 epidemic with
consideration of individual behavioural responses and engagements with the government,
including extension in holidays, restriction on travel, quarantine, and hospitalization (Lin et al.
2020). This work combined zoonotic transmission with the emigration pattern, and then estimate
the future trends and the reporting proportion. The model gives promising insight into the trend of
the COVID-19 outbreak, especially the impact of individual and government reactions or
responses to the epidemic. The authors (Anastassopoulou et al. 2020) estimated the average values
of the key epidemiological parameters including the per day case mortality, recovery ratios, and
the basic reproduction number R0 representing the average number of ancillary cases that results
2

from the introduction of a single infectious case in an entirely susceptible population during the
active period of the pandemic. The authors fit the dataset to the Susceptible-Infectious-RecoveredDead (SIDR) model and attempted a three-week prediction of the dynamics of the outbreak at the
epic centre. The estimated mean value of R0 as calculated considering the period from the 11th
January to 18th of January was found to be around 2.6 based on the official confirmed cases. The
authors (Hu et al. 2020) proposed a machine learning approach to predict the magnitude, intervals,
and completion period of the disease. The authors proposed an improved auto-encoder model to
analyse the spread changing aspects of the epidemics then predict the definite cases. In the model,
hidden variables are used to group the cities for probing the spread arrangement. By means of the
many-step predicting, the expected errors of 6,7,8,9 and 10-step predicting remained 1.64%,
2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, correspondingly.
Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) is a flexible method to include independent series in
dynamic regression models. ARDL models contain previous values of together response and
explanatory variables series. They have been widely used in various domains including marketing,
energy, epidemiology, agronomy and ecological studies (Huffaker & Fearne 2019). Over the years,
many packages have been developed for ARDL. For example (Pesaran et al. 2001). The distributed
lag model has a wide range of application i.e. cointegration study in which small and large-run
relations between time series data. ARDL boundaries testing of (Pesaran et al. 2001), which is a
common co-integration study technique founded on the distributive lag model and further research
work in progress.
The other package developed by (Demirhan 2020) is nardl to use Distributed Lag Models
(DLMs) in R. The package nardl focuses on the application of the nonlinear cointegrating
ARDL model is developed by (Shin et al. 2014). The recent package dynlm takes a unique
purpose to fit linear models via stabilizing time-series features (Zeileis & Zeileis 2019). In the
current study, we will use the R programming and dLagM package that outfits the ARDL test
method (Pesaran et al. 2001). Subsequently, dLagM uses lag orders, dataset, and overall method
which make the prerequisite lags and changes for a definite models. One of the benefits of this
approach is that the users are not required to specify the variation for the applied models. Which
brings efficacy and value to researchers in various areas.
In this work, we present a comparative analysis of various machine learning approaches including
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Artificial
Neural Network in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak in the epidemiological domain. We aim to
determine how well each of these approaches performs in predicting the confirmed and death cases
and then compare their performances with each other. Particularly, we first apply ARDL method
to identify and model the short and the long-run relationships of the time-series COVID-19
datasets (confirmed, recovered and death cases). That is, we determine the lags between a response
variable and its respective explanatory time series variables as independent variables. Then, the
resulting significant variables concerning their lags are used in the regression model selected by
the ARDL model for predicting and forecasting the trend and dynamics of the COVID-19. We

evaluated the models using relevant accuracy and error metrics including Root Mean Square Error
(RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Materials & Methods
Data Source
We conducted our study based on the publicly accessible data of daily deaths, recovered and
confirmed cases 17549, 332062 and 694123 respectively reported for all over the world from 22nd
January 2020 to 18th Jan 2021, (Fig. 1). The data is available in the online repository - GitHub
(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). We perform data processing including the
conversion of data format from cumulative to daily basis. This repository is for COVID-19 visual
dashboard operated by Johns Hopkins University Centre Systems Science and Engineering (JHU
CSSE). They have aggregated data from sources like WHO, WorldoMeters, BNO News, and
Washington State Department of Health and many more. The data have the number of confirmed
cases, the recovered cases, and the death cases for the global. On this data, we attempted to forecast
the key epidemiological parameters, i.e., the number of upcoming daily new confirmed cases,
deaths, and recoveries. Though, the quantity of deaths, recovery, and confirmed cases of
individuals is expected to be much higher along time. Therefore, we have similarly derived a
correlation between these two variables and their past record (lags) by using the ARDL model.

Autoregressive Distributive Lag Models
The ARDL models are used between regressed series and k number of regressors series in
regression analysis. In this study, we used tseries, timeseries, zoo and window
packages for the data. In the same way, dLagM package in R for ARDL model. An orders 𝑝 and
𝑞 of the ARDL lag model are denoted by ARDL (𝑝, 𝑞), which has independent 𝑝 lags series and
dependent 𝑞 lags series. If there is only one independent series, the dependent lag series makes the
model autoregressive. The numeral of 𝑝𝑡ℎ independent lag series is denoted by 𝑝𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1, . . . , 𝑛
denotes daily recover and confirm cases, the 𝑞 𝑡ℎ lags of dependent variable series are shown by 𝑞𝑖 ,
where 𝑖 = 0,1, … , 𝑚.
The ARDL model can be expressed as:
𝑦𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛽1 𝑦𝑡−1 + 𝛽2 𝑦𝑡−2 + ⋯ , 𝛽𝑗 𝑦𝑡−𝑖 + 𝛾1 𝑥𝑡 + 𝛾2 𝑥𝑡−1 + ⋯ , 𝛾𝑖 𝑥𝑡−𝑗 +
𝛿1 𝑤𝑡 + 𝛿2 𝑤𝑡−1 + ⋯ , 𝛿𝑖 𝑤𝑡−𝑗 + 𝜀𝑡

(1)

Where 𝑦𝑡 denotes the number of daily deaths at time 𝑡. 𝛼0 represent the intercept term. In the same
way, 𝛽1 𝑦𝑡−1 + 𝛽2 𝑦𝑡−2 + ⋯ , 𝛽𝑞 𝑦𝑡−𝑖 denotes the 𝑞 𝑡ℎ autoregressive lag order of the model of the
dependent variable. The two independent variables “recover cases” and “confirm cases” are
denoted by 𝑥𝑡 and 𝑤𝑡 respectively. Whereas 𝛾1 𝑥𝑡 + 𝛾2 𝑥𝑡−1 + ⋯ , 𝛾𝑖 𝑥𝑡−𝑗 and 𝛿1 𝑤𝑡 + 𝛿2 𝑤𝑡−1 +
⋯ , 𝛿𝑖 𝑤𝑡−𝑗 represent the lags order of 𝑥𝑡 and 𝑤𝑡 respectively. The parameters 𝛽, 𝛾 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛿 denoted
5

coefficients of death, recover, and confirm cases, respectively, while 𝜀𝑡 denotes the error term.
Eq.1 can be further simplified and presented in (Eq. 2):
𝑛
𝑛
𝑦𝑡 = 𝛼0 + ∑𝑚
𝑖=1 𝛽𝑖 𝑦𝑡−𝑖 + ∑𝑗=0 𝛾𝑗 𝑥𝑡−𝑗 + ∑𝑗=0 𝛿𝑗 𝑤𝑡−𝑗 + 𝜀𝑡

(2)

The number of death, confirm, and recover cases of people is likely to be much higher with time.
Therefore, the ARDL model for recovered cases 𝑥𝑡 and confirmed cases 𝑤𝑡 is shown in (Eq.3).
𝑥𝑡 = 𝜃0 + 𝛾1 𝑥𝑡−1 + ⋯ , 𝛾𝑖 𝑥𝑡−𝑗 + 𝛿1 𝑤𝑡 + 𝛿2 𝑤𝑡−1 + ⋯ , 𝛿𝑖 𝑤𝑡−𝑗 + 𝜀𝑡

(3)

Similarly, the ARDL model for confirmed and recovered cases is shown in (Eq.4)
𝑤𝑡 = 𝜗0 + 𝛿1 𝑤𝑡 + 𝛿2 𝑤𝑡−1 + ⋯ , 𝛿𝑖 𝑤𝑡−𝑗 + 𝛾1 𝑥𝑡−1 + ⋯ , 𝛾𝑖 𝑥𝑡−𝑗 + 𝜀𝑡

(4)

There are different criteria’s used to select an optimal lag length selection. The authors in (Chandio
et al. 2020) use Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the authors in (Gayawan & Ipinyomi
2009) compare AIC, SIC and adj-R square to select the optimal lag length. We use adj-R square
and parsimony model criteria to select an optimal number of the lag length in this study. It makes
the call to the function easier when the number of lags order are the same, however, when the
number of lags order is different from dependent and every independent sequence, we use the
argument remove. It will remove the lags that are not contributed to the model. Once the ARDL
model specifies the significant coefficients of the dependent variable and independent variables,
the models including the RF, SVM, KNN, and ANN are used to assess the accuracy and error rate
of these models. We utilized RF (Biau & Scornet 2016), SVM (Liang et al. 2018), KNN (Martínez
et al. 2019) and ANN (Hu et al. 2018) time series models were applied to predict the COVID-19.
To overcome the overfitting problem, we use 80% training and 20% testing parts, respectively.
Random forest is one of the best learning algorithms and it requires a bit parameter tuning. In the
current study, randomForest, forecast, caret, tiyverse, tsibble and purr
package are used for RF. the ntree is 500, mtry is p/3, where p is the number of features,
sampsize is 70% and type is “regression” utilized in the function. The other parameters are
kept as default.
Generally, in time series analysis, Support Vector Regression (SVR) is used. In this study, we use
e1071 library, the parameters cost=102, gamma(ᵧ) = 0.1, and the insensitivity (є) = 0.3
respectively. But the function we called SVM and it automatically chooses SVR or SVM when it
detects continuous/categorical response of the data respectively. In SVM, various kernel functions
are used to develop the input space into a feature space with a complex dimension. Like Gaussian
Radial Basis (GRBF), Sigmoid, polynomial, etc. are some kernel functions. For SVM, we use
Radial Basis Kernels (RBF) 𝑘𝛾 (𝑦𝑖 , 𝑦𝑗 ) = exp (−𝛾‖𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦𝑗 ‖)2. In the SVM model, using RBF
kernels it is necessary to tune model parameters to find an optimal value of the parameters and
reducing the overfitting problem. So, we use the grid search method of tenfold cross-validation on
the training part and testing part and their results are averaged.

k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) predicts the response variable based on the nearest training points. In
this study, we use caret package for k-nearest neighbor Regression in R. It uses a training dataset
in its place of learning a discriminative function from the training data. k-NN is used both for
classification and regression problems. There are various techniques use to improve model
accuracy. Such as maximum percentage accuracy graph, Elbow method, for loops to select an
optimal value of k. Generally, the square root of n is used, and we utilized √𝑛.
ANN is a mathematical tool and has been generally used for classification and forecasting
problems properly that contain predictors (input) and response (output) layers, and a hidden layer.
A combination of different hidden layers is used to choose a better MLP architecture network. It
is the hidden layers in ANN models that play an important role in many successful applications of
neural networks. In the current study, we use neuralnet package for ANN. The parameters, the
algorithm, threshold, and linear.output is ‘backprop’, 0.01, TRUE and the other parameters are
kept as default, respectively. ANN model is widely used in the economic and financial studies
(Huang et al. 2007; Qi 1996). The number of hidden layers depends upon the nature of the
problem. The authors in (Zhang et al. 1998) used two hidden layers and finds better model
prediction accuracy. In the same way, the authors in (Xu et al. 2020) used (2 × 𝑘 + 1), where 𝑘 is
the number of predictors (inputs). For an optimal result of ANN, usually, trial and error method is
used in determining the number of hidden nodes i.e. searching the architecture having the smallest
MAPE among the models (Güler & Übeyli 2005). We use 4 hidden layers and 8 neurons in the
hidden layers for daily death cases using trial and error procedure and 10,000 times iteration. In
the same way, we use 2 hidden layers and 4 number of neurons in the hidden layers for daily
recover cases.
Forecast Evaluation Criterions
In this study, as the response variable is continuous, therefore, the forecasting capacity of different
machine learning approaches are evaluated by using five different criterions including mean error
(ME), RMSE, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Percentage Error (MPE) and MAPE and
presented in (Tab. 1). Where n represents the total number of prediction on training and testing
parts respectively, 𝑌𝑡 and 𝑌̂𝑡 representing the observed and predicted values, respectively.

Results
A total of three data sets of COVID-19 (confirm, recover and death) are used to evaluate the
performance of the different ML approaches and suggested the best model for forecasting the COVID19 outbreak. All data sets consisting of the world daily confirm, recover and deaths cases. Every time
series divided into training and testing sets of observations. The original data divided into 80%
training and 20% testing parts and the first 80% of the total observations in every time series used as
a training set whereas the rest 20% used as the testing set. To overcome the overfitting problem, we
use 10-fold cross-validation for each of the models and then their results are averaged. In addition, we
also used prediction accuracy for training parts. Each time series containing a total of 366 observations
spanning (22 January 2020, to 18 Jan 2021), the first 252 observations spanning (22 January 2020, to
07 Nov 2020) belong to the training series and the rest 74 observations spanning (08 Nov 2020, to 18
Jan 2021) part of the testing series.
We use death, recover, and confirm cases from the COVID-19 dataset. The COVID-19 dataset is
loaded into the R package environment, and then, we fit ARDL model to the Daily Deaths series
𝑦𝑡 with recover 𝑅𝑡 and confirm 𝐶𝑡 cases. We choose 𝑝1 = 3, 𝑝2 = 1, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑞 = 1 using adj-R
square and parsimony of the model. The insignificant variables are removed and fit the ARDL
model. The results obtained from the ARDL model are presented in (Tab.2).

The coefficient related to confirm cases 𝐶𝑡 and its first lag are highly significant at 1% level and
5% level, respectively. Similarly, first lag of the response variable 𝑦𝑡 (daily deaths of COVID-19),
are significant at the 1% level. In addition, the coefficient of recover cases (first and second lags)
are also significant at 1% level and 5% level, respectively. Overall, the model is highly significant
at the 1% level with a p-value smaller than 2.2e-16 with the adjusted R-squared equal to 85.2%.
The fitted model can be written as:

In the second scenario, we examine the relationship between the number of recover cases and

the ARDL model to the datasets. The results obtained from the ARDL model are presented in (Tab.

Tab. 4 shows the summary of the ARDL model, the confirm cases recorded in the current,
first, second and the third lags. The daily confirm cases of the first lags have a significant impact
on the number of daily confirm cases from the COVID-19 on first lag, second lag and the number
of confirm cases. The model is significant at the 1% level (𝑃 < 0.0000031), the adjusted Rsquared value is 85.39%. The fitted model can be written as:

We evaluate models including RF, SVM, KNN, and ANN to compare their performance using
various accuracy metrics including ME, RMSE, MAE, MPE and MAPE. These metrics provide
different perspectives to assess predicting models. The first three are the absolute performance
measures while the fourth and fifth are relative performance measures. The training sample is used
to estimate the parameters for specific model architecture. The testing set is then used to select the
best model among all models considered. Tab. 5 summarizes the RF, SVM, KNN, and ANN
forecasting accuracy measures for the training set of COVID-19 daily deaths data.

In (Tab. 5), the values of ME for RF, SVM, KNN, and ANN models are 88.22, 349.01, 112.93 and
4.21 respectively. This reveals that RF shows the lowest value (the best) among the other methods.

Discussion
The performance of the neural network model can be assessed once trained the network employing
the performance function as a prediction. All the methods are capable of capturing the pattern of
the data effectively. Moreover, ANN performed well and almost capture the whole pattern of the
testing part of the data when compared to RF, SVM, and KNN methods. Fig.3 shown the prediction

Conclusions
This paper proposed four predicting models for COVID-19 outbreak. The methods are compared
with respect to five performance metrics including ME, RMSE, MAE, MPE, and MAPE. The
results for the daily deaths cases are based on 80% training and 20% testing parts. Among the four
methods using these performance metrics, the ANN achieved better results in every aspect. In the
same way, the results obtained for the daily recovered cases using 80% training and 20% testing
parts and ANN have attained better results with respect to the other methods. Moreover, daily
confirm cases results obtained using the same training and testing parts and in most of the cases
ANN performed better than the other methods. Therefore, the major findings of this study reveal
that ANNs outperform the rest of the methods for both models. In addition, ANN suggests
20

consistent prediction performance compared to RF, SVM, and KNN models and hence preferable
as a robust forecast model. The AI-based method's accuracy for predicting the trajectory of the
COVID-19 is high. For this specific application in predicting the disease, the authors consider the
results are reliable. In this study, ANN generates the fastest convergence and good forecast ability
in most cases. The results showed the compensations of machine learning algorithms to support
strategy/decision-makers in evolving short term policies about the number of disease prevalence.
The forecast models will support the government and health staff to be ready for the forthcoming
circumstances and take further promptness in healthcare structures. The forecasted figures were
calculated for the next fifteen days (i.e., 19 Jan 2021 to 03 Feb 2021) for COVID-19 data.
It is worth noting that forecasting is a complex matter, and some tailored models might not be
ubiquitous owing to the complex societal and economic circumstances of different nations. The
models and predictions proposed in this article do not reflect the local demography, and the real
statistics can variate owing to numerous governmental actions like concentration on lockdown, the
strategy of isolation and health facilities, etc. Thus, readers should be careful while interpreting
these forecasts.
