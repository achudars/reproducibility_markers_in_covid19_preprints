Background and Objective: The novel Coronavirus also called COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and
has now spread across the world. It has so far infected around 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114,698 lives
overall. As the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing shortage of testing kits and resources.
The limited quantity of testing kits and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep Learning
model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays.
Methods: In this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically detect COVID-19
infection from chest X-ray images. The proposed model is based on Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and
trained end-to-end on a dataset prepared by collecting COVID-19 and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different
publically available databases.
Results: CoroNet has been trained and tested on the prepared dataset and the experimental results show that our proposed model
achieved an overall accuracy of 89.6%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for COVID-19 cases are 93% and 98.2%
for 4-class cases (COVID vs Pneumonia bacterial vs pneumonia viral vs normal). For 3-class classiﬁcation (COVID vs Pneumonia
vs normal), the proposed model produced a classiﬁcation accuracy of 95%. The preliminary results of this study look promising
which can be further improved as more training data becomes available.
Conclusion: CoroNet achieved promising results on a small prepared dataset which indicates that given more data, the
proposed model can achieve better results with minimum pre-processing of data. Overall, the proposed model substantially
advances the current radiology based methodology and during COVID- 19 pandemic, it can be very helpful tool for clinical
practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis, quantiﬁcation and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.

INTRODUCTION
The 2019 novel Coronavirus or COVID-19, first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 belongs to the family of viruses
“Coronavirus” (CoV) was called “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) before it was named COVID-19
by World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
on 30 January 2020 [1] and finally on March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 as Pandemic. After the outbreak, the number of daily
cases began to increase exponentially and reached 1.8 million cases and around 114698 deaths globally by 12 April 2020. The virus has
engulfed more than 210 countries among which USA, Spain and Italy are severely hit with 560,433, 166,831 and 156,363 active cases
and 22,115, 17,209 and 19,899 deaths respectively [2].
Once infected, a COVID-19 patient may develop various symptoms and signs of infection which include fever, cough and respiratory
illness (like flu). In severe cases, the infection may cause pneumonia, difficulty breathing, multi-organ failure and death [2,3]. Due to
the rapid and increasing growth rate of the COVID-19 cases, the health system of many advanced countries has come to the point of
collapse. They are now facing shortage of ventilators and testing kits. Many countries have declared total lockdown and asked its
population to stay indoors and strictly avoid gatherings.

A critical and important step in fighting COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, such that positive patients can be isolated
and treated. Currently, the main screening method used for detecting COVID-19 is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (rRT-PCR) [4,5]. The test is done on respiratory samples of the patient and the results can be available within few hours to 2
days. An alternate method to PCR screening method can be based on chest radiography images. Various research articles published in
Radiology journal [6,7] indicate that that chest scans might be useful in detecting COVID-19. Researchers found that the lungs of patients
with COVID-19 symptoms have some visual marks like ground-glass opacities—hazy darkened spots that can differentiate COVID-19
infected patients from non COVID-19 infected ones [8,9]. The researchers believe that chest radiology based system can be an effective
tool in detection, quantification and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.
A chest radiology image based detection system can have many advantages over conventional method. It can be fast, analyze multiple
cases simultaneously, have greater availability and more importantly, such system can be very useful in hospitals with no or limited
number of testing kits and resources. Moreover, given the importance of radiography in modern health care system, radiology imaging
systems are available in every hospital, thus making radiography based approach more convenient and easily available.
Today, researchers from all around the world, from various different fields are working day and night to fight this pandemic. Many
researchers have published series of preprint papers demonstrating approaches for COVID-19 detection from chest radiography images
[10,11]. These approaches have achieved promising results on a small dataset but by no means are production ready solutions. These
approaches still need rigorous testing and improvement before putting them in use. Subsequently, a large number of researchers and data
scientists are working together to build highly accurate and reliable deep learning based approaches for detection and management of
COVID-19 disease. Researchers are focusing on deep learning techniques to detect any specific features from chest radiography images
of COVID-19 patients. In recent past, deep learning has been very successful in various visual tasks which include medical image
analysis as well. Deep learning has revolutionized automatic disease diagnosis and management by accurately analyzing, identifying,
classifying patterns in medical images. The reason behind such success is that deep learning techniques do not rely on manual handcrafted
features but these algorithms learn features automatically from data itself [12]. In the past, deep learning has had success in disease
classification using chest radiography image. ChexNet[13] is a deep neural network model that detects Pneumonia from chest X-ray
image. ChexNet achieved exceptional results exceeding average radiologist performance. Another similar approach called ChestNet [14]
is a deep neural network model designed to diagnose thorax diseases on chest radiography images.
The success of AI based techniques in automatic diagnosis in the medical field and rapid rise in COVID-10 cases have necessitated the
need of AI based automatic detection and diagnosis system. Recently, many researchers have used radiology images for COVD-19
detection. A deep learning model for COVID-19 detection (COVID-Net) proposed by Wang and Wong [10] obtained 83.5% accuracy
in classifying COVID-19, normal, pneumonia-bacterial and pneumonia-viral classes. Hemdan et al. [15] used various deep learning
models to diagnose COVID-19 from cheat X-ray images and proposed a COVIDX-Net model comprising seven CNN models.
Apostolopoulos and Mpesiana [16] trained different pre-trained deep learning models on a dataset comprising of 224 confirmed COVID19 images and achieved 98.75% and 93.48% accuracy for two and three classes, respectively. Narin et al. [11] trained ResNet50 model
using chest X-ray images and achieved a 98% COVID-19 detection accuracy for two classes. However, the performance for multi class
classification is not known. Sethy and Behera [17] used various convolutional neural network (CNN) models along support vector
machine (SVM) classifier for COVID-19 classification. Their study states that the ResNet50 model with SVM classifier provided the
best performance. Most recently Ozturk et al. [18] proposed a deep network based on DarkNet model. Their model consists of 17
convolution layers with Leaky RelU as activation function. Their model achieved an accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02%

for multi-class cases. All these techniques except COVID-Net [10] either perform binary classification (normal vs COVID-19) or 3–
class classification (normal vs pneumonia vs COVID-19). Other than COVID-Net, none of the methods discussed above treat pneumonia
bacterial and pneumonia viral as separate classes.
In this study, we present a deep learning based approach to detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. We propose a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify three different types of Pneumonia; bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia and
COVID-19 pneumonia. We also implemented binary and 3-class versions of our proposed model and compared the results with other
studies in the literature. The proposed model is called CoroNet and will help us identifying the difference between three types of
pneumonia infections and how COVID-19 is different from other infections. A model that can identify COVID-19 infection from chest
radiography images can be very helpful to doctors in the triage, quantification and follow-up of positive cases. Even if this model does
not completely replace the existing testing method, it can still be used to bring down the number of cases that need immediate testing or
further review from experts.

DATASET
Deep learning is all about data which serves as fuel in these learning models. Since COVID-19 is a new disease, there is no appropriate
sized dataset available that can be used for this study. Therefore, we had to create a dataset by collecting chest X-ray images from two
different publically available image databases. COVID-19 X-ray images are available at an open source Github repository by Joseph et
al [19]. The authors have compiled the radiology images from various authentic sources (Radiological Society of North America
(RSNA), Radiopaedia etc) of COVID-19 cases for research purpose and most of the studies on COVID-19 use images from this source.
The repository contains an open database of COVID-19 cases with chest X-ray or CT images and is being updated regularly. At the time
of writing this paper, the database contained around 290 COVID-19 chest radiography images. Pneumonia bacterial, Pneumonia viral
and normal chest X-ray images were obtained from Kaggle repository “Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)” [20]. The dataset consists of

METHODOLOGY
In this section, we will discuss the work methodology for the proposed technique, model architecture, implementation and training. The
work methodology is also illustrated in Figure 2.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Convolutional Neural Network also known as CNN is a deep learning technique that consists of multiple layers stacked together which
uses local connections known as local receptive field and weight-sharing for better performance and efficiency. The deep architecture
helps these networks learn many different and complex features which a simple neural network cannot learn. Convolutional neural
networks are powering core of computer vision that has many applications which include self-driving cars, robotics, and treatments for
the visually impaired. The main concept of CNN is to obtain local features from input (usually an image) at higher layers and combine
them into more complex features at the lower layers [21] [22].
A typical Convolutional Neural Network architecture consists of the following layers:
a)

Convolutional Layer
Convolution layer is the core building block of a Convolutional Neural Network which uses convolution operation (represented
by *) in place of general matrix multiplication. Its parameters consist of a set of learnable filters also known as kernels. The
main task of the convolutional layer is to detect features found within local regions of the input image that are common
throughout the dataset and mapping their appearance to a feature map. The convolution operation is given as
𝐹(𝑖, 𝑗) = (𝐼 ∗ 𝐾)(𝑖, 𝑗) = ∑ ∑ 𝐼(𝑖 + 𝑚, 𝑗 + 𝑛)𝐾(𝑚, 𝑛)
𝑚

𝐸𝑞 (1)

𝑛

Where I is the input matrix (image), K is the 2D filter of size m x n and F represents the output 2D feature map. Here the input
I is convolved with the filter K and produces the feature map F. This convolution operation is denoted by I*K.
The output of each convolutional layer is fed to an activation function to introduce non-linearity. There are number of activation
functions available but the one which is recognized for deep learning is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). ReLU simply computes
the activation by thresholding the input at zero. In other words, ReLU outputs 0 if the input is less than 0, and raw output
otherwise. It is mathematically given as:
𝑓(𝑥) = max(0, 𝑥)

b)

𝐸𝑞(2)

Subsampling (Pooling) Layer
In CNN, the sequence of convolution layer is followed by an optional pooling or down sampling layer to reduce the spatial
size of the input and thus reducing the number of parameters in the network. A pooling layer takes each feature map output
from the convolutional layer and down samples it i.e. pooling layer summarizes a region of neurons in the convolution layer.
There most common pooling technique is Max Pooling which simply outputs the maximum value in the input region. Other
pooling options are average pooling and L2-norm pooling.

c)

Fully Connected Layer
In fully connected layer each neuron from previous layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer and every value
contributes in predicting how strongly a value matches a particular class. The output of last fully connected layer is then
forwarded to an activation function which outputs the class scores. Softmax and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are the two

Figure 2: Overview of the proposed methodology

main classifiers used in CNN. Softmax function which computes the probability distribution of the n output classes is given
as

𝑍𝑘 =

𝑒𝑥

𝑘

∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝑒 𝑥 𝑛

𝐸𝑞 (3)

Where x is the input vector and Z is the output vector. The sum of all outputs (Z) equals to 1. The proposed model CoroNet
uses Softmax, to predict the class to which the input X-ray image belongs to.
All the layers discussed above are stacked up to make a full CNN architecture. In addition to these main layers mentioned above, CNN
may include optional layers like batch normalization layer to improve the training time and dropout layer to address the overfitting issue.

Model Architecture and Development
CoroNet is a CNN architecture tailored for detection of COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. It is based on Xception CNN
architecture [23]. Xception which stands for Extreme version of Inception [24] (its predecessor model) is a 71 layers deep CNN
architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset. Xception uses depthwise separable convolution layers with residual connections instead of
classical convolutions. Depthwise Separable Convolution replaces classic n x n x k convolution operation with 1 x 1 x k point-wise
convolution operation followed by channel-wise n x n spatial convolution operation. This way the number of operations are reduced by a
factor proportional to 1/k.
Residual connections are 'skip connections' which allow gradients to flow
through a network directly, without passing through non-linear activation
functions and thus avoiding the problem of vanishing gradients. In residual
connections, output of a weight layer series is added to the original input and
then passed through non-linear activation function as shown in Figure 3.
CoroNet uses Xception as base model with a dropout layer and two fullyconnected layers added at the end. CoroNet has 33,969,964 parameters in total
out of which 33,969,964 trainable and 54528 are non-trainable parameters.
Architecture details, layer-wise parameters and output shape of CoroNet model
are shown in Table II. To initialize the model parameters, we used Transfer
Learning to overcome the problem of overfitting as the training data was not
sufficient.

Implementation and Training
We implemented three scenarios of the proposed model to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. First model is the main multiclass model (4-class CoroNet) which is trained to classify chest X-ray images into four categories: COVID-19, Normal, Pneumoniabacterial and Pneumonia-viral. The other two models 3-class CoroNet (COVID-19, Normal and Pneumonia) and binary 2-class CoroNet
model (COVID-19, Normal and Pneumonia) are modifications of the main multi-class model.
The proposed model, CoroNet was implemented in Keras on top of Tensorflow 2.0. The model was pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and
then retrained end-to-end on prepared dataset using Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.0001, batch size of 10 and epoch value of
80. For training, data shuffling was enabled which involves shuffling the data before each epoch. All the experiment and training was
done on Google Colaboratory Ubuntu server equipped with Tesla K80 graphics card. We used 4-fold cross-validation [25] approach to
assess the performance of our main 4-class model. The training set was randomly divided into 4 equal sets. Three out of four sets were
used to train the CNN model while the remaining set was used for validation. This strategy was repeated 4 times by shifting the validation
and training sets. Final performance of the model was reported by averaging values obtained from each fold. Plots of accuracy and loss
on the training and validation sets over training epochs for Fold 4 are shown in Figure 4.

RESULTS
The multi-class classification result of the proposed model was recorded for each Fold and then average numbers were calculated. The
performance of the proposed CoroNet on each fold is presented in the form of Confusion matrix (CM) in Figure 5. Overall Accuracy,
precision, recall and F-measure computed for each fold by formulae given below are summarized in Table III.

The aforementioned performance metrics are the top metrics used to measure the performance of classification algorithms. The proposed
model CoroNet achieved an average accuracy of 89.6%, while as average accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure (F1-Score) for
COVID-19 class are 96.6%, 93.17%, 98.25% and 95.6% respectively. The class wise performance of CoroNet is presented in Table IV.
The performance for Non COVID-19 pneumonia classes (pneumonia-bacterial and pneumonia-viral) are comparatively lower than other
two classes and contributes to the lower overall accuracy. If we combine the pneumonia-bacterial and pneumonia-viral into one single
class as Pneumonia class, then the overall accuracy increases significantly. We did slight modification to same 4-class CoroNet model
and fine-tuned it for three classes only. In this way we did not have to retrain the model from end-to-end. After fine-tuning, the model
was tested on test set comprising of 29 COVID-19, 72 normal and 120 pneumonia cases. The Confusion matrix of 3-class CoroNet is
presented in Figure 6(a). After combining the two non-COVID-19 pneumonia infections, the overall accuracy of CoroNet increased
from 89.5% to 94.59%. Finally, the confusion matrix for the binary classification problem in detecting COVID-19 positive is presented
in Figure 6(b). In addition, precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy results for all three classification tasks are given in Table V.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we proposed a deep model based on Xception architecture to detect COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. The
proposed model was tested on two datasets and performed exceptionally well on both of them. Our model achieved an accuracy of
89.5%, 94.59% and 99% for 4-classes, 3-classes and binary class classification tasks respectively. Furthermore, our model also achieved
an accuracy of 90% on dataset-2. Another positive observation from the results is the precision (PPV) and recall (Sensitivity) for COVID19 cases. Higher recall value means low false negative (FN) cases and low number of FN is an encouraging result. This is important
because minimizing the missed COVID-19 cases as much as possible is the main aim of this research.
The results obtained by our proposed model are superior compared to other studies in the literature. Table VII presents a summary of
studies conducted in the automated diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images and their comparison with our proposed model
CoroNet. Figure 8 shows CoroNet results on some sample images from the test set.
Wang and Wong [10] presented a residual deep architecture called COVID-Net for detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.
COVID-Net is one of the early works done on COVID-19 which uses deep neural network to classify chest X-ray images into four
categories (COVID, Normal, Pneumonia bacterial and Pneumonia Viral). COVID-Net achieved an accuracy of 83.5% for four classes.
Table VIII presents performance comparison of COVID-Net and our proposed model CoroNet on 4-class classification task.
Apostolopoulos and Mpesiana [16] evaluated various state-of-the-art deep architectures on chest X-ray images. With transfer learning
their best model VGG19 managed to achieve an accuracy of 93.48% and 98.75% for 3-class and 2-class classification tasks respectively
on a dataset consisting of 224 COVID-19, 700 pneumonia and 504 normal X-ray images.
Narin et al. [11] performed same experiment with three different CNN models (ResNet50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2) and
ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet database achieved best accuracy of 98% for 2-class classification. Since, they did not include

CNN model along with SVM for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. CNN model acts as feature extractor and SVM
serves the purpose of classifier. Their model achieved an accuracy of 95.38% on 2-class problem.

Their model achieved binary and 3-class classification accuracy of 98.08% and 87.02%, respectively on a dataset consisting of 125
COVID-19, 500 Pneumonia and 500 normal chest X-ray images.
The promising and encouraging results of deep learning models in detection of COVID-19 from radiography images indicate that deep
learning has a greater role to play in fighting this pandemic in near future. Some limitation of this study can be overcome with more in
depth analysis which is possible once more patient data (both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients) becomes available.

CONCLUSION
As the cases of COVID-19 pandemic are increasing daily, many countries are facing shortage of resources. During this health emergency,
it is important that not even a single positive case goes unidentified. With this thing in mind, we proposed a deep learning approach to
detect COVID-19 cases from chest radiography images. The proposed method (CoroNet) is a convolutional neural network designed to
identify COVID-19 cases using chest X-ray images. The model has been trained and tested on a small dataset of few hundred images
prepared by obtaining chest X-ray images of various pneumonia cases and COVID-19 cases from different publically available databases.
CoroNet is computationally less expensive and achieved promising results on the prepared dataset. The performance can further be
improved once more training data becomes available. Notwithstanding the encouraging results, CoroNet still needs clinical study and
testing but with higher accuracy and sensitivity for COVID-19 cases, CoroNet can still be beneficial for radiologists and health experts
to gain deeper understandings into critical aspects associated with COVID-19 cases.
