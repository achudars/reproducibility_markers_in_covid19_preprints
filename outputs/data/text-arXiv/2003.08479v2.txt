Motivated by different responses of governments of many countries to COVID-19, here we develop a toy model of the epidemics dependence on the availability of tests. Our model, that we
call SUDR+K, is based on the well known SIR model, but it splits the total fraction of infected
individuals into two components: those that are undetected and those that are detected through
tests. Moreover, we assume that available tests increase at a constant rate from the beginning of
epidemics but are consumed to detect infected individuals. Strikingly we find a bi-stable behavior
between a phase with a giant fraction of infected and a phase with a very small fraction. We show
that the separation between these two regimes is governed by a match between the rate of testing
and the rate of infection spread at given time. We also show that the existence of two phases
is largely independent of the precise mathematical form of the term describing the rate at which
undetected individuals are tested and detected. The present research implies that a vigorous early
testing activity, before the epidemics enters into its giant phase, can potentially keep epidemics
under control, and that even a very small change of the testing rate can increase or decrease the
size of the whole epidemics over many orders of magnitude.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the
associated illness COVID-19 has triggered, in this century, unprecedented containment measures around the
world including the complete lock-down of the populations of all towns in in many European and non-European
countries, including China and US [1]. The World Health
Organization has declared the diffusion of COVID-19 to
be a pandemics and issued a strong warning of a severe
global threat [2]. In the case of the COVID-19 epidemics
there is also an infodemic of true and false news about
the danger, the diffusion and the treatments of COVID19 [3]. This context muddles the attempts to understand
the epidemics and confuses people. At the same time we
witness a very active participation among scientists following the epidemics on all social media and platforms.
Some of important questions are: (i) How many infected
people are undetected? (ii) How the number of tests and
testing policies affects the dynamics of epidemics? (iii)
Is there any evident benefit in early massive testing?
Some of those questions have been addressed with different methods in the context of previous different epidemics and have recently been addressed in the present
COVID-19 diffusion with almost no explicit effort of theoretical modeling until now. In [4], authors statistically
evaluate different strategies of testing in the context of
ebola epidemics and show the importance of early testing. They found that an appropriate implementation of
this practice would reduce epidemics by one third. In [5]
authors review laboratory testing for influenza, which is
often mentioned to be similar to SARS-CoV-2 in spreading features, and lay out all the possible ways in which
early tests can be used to fight the diffusion of such a

disease. In [6] authors conclude that undocumented infections present the same main channels of geographic
spread of SARS-CoV-2 .
There is an ongoing effort in calibrating models for the
dynamics of this epidemics in order to set the values of
the model parameters significantly affecting the diffusion
[7–9]. In this letter we adopt the available numerical
estimates published in this studies. Parameters, whose
calibration is impossible due to lack of data, are implicitly
kept within realistic ranges.
In order to explicitly take into account the different
impacts on the spreading dynamics of undetected and
detected infected individuals, and the contribution of the
available number of testing kits to put the epidemics under control, here we extend the usual SIR model to a
novel “SUDR + K” one [10]. In the model we propose
four states for the individuals of a population: S (susceptible), U (undetected), D (detected) and R (removed).
Moreover, we introduce an additional variable K which
models the number of available test kits. Susceptible are
those individuals in the population who can acquire disease. Infected individuals can be detected or undetected,
therefore I = U + D. Detected are those that are positively tested, and undetected are infected of which no
one precisely knows of (although some may be suspected
for infection). Removed are those individuals that either
healed and acquired immunity or are deceased. Total
number of people in the population is N . Lower case
letters represent fraction of population, s + u + d + r = 1
(u + d = i = I/N ), and k = K/N represents available
number of tests per capita.
Even though in reality there are different kinds of tests
(including nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs,
bronchoalveolar lavage, serum testing, CT scan etc. [11]),

2
we gather all the kinds in a single family of tests.
The model we propose is defined by the following equations:

ṡ = −βsu
u̇ = βsu − δuk − γu
d˙ = δuk − γd

(1)
(2)

ṙ = γ(u + d)

(3)
(4)

k̇ = α − δuk

(5)

FIG. 1. Red line represents detected fraction of population,
through time; blue - undetected and black - susceptible for
parameters β = ln 2, δ = 0.5, γ = ln 2/7, α = 0.02,  = 1.

II.

Equation (1) is just the usual equation of SIR model
that represents the dynamics from susceptible to be infected after exposure. Here we put u instead of i, because
we assume that after detection the probability to spread
the contagion becomes negligible [12].
Equation (2) needs a more detailed explanation. The
first term just represents the fraction of individuals that
changed their state from susceptible to infected. The second term models the change of undetected to detected by
testing. If there are no tests no one can get detected, if
there are no undetected again no one can get detected. It
is then proportional to both the numbers of undetected
and of kits. It is motivated by the idea that infected
individuals report to hospital on the basis of symptoms
(proportional to u) and get tested with higher probability
if there is abundance of kits or lower if there is a scarcity
of kits. The third term represents just the fraction of individuals that gets removed without ever been detected.
Equation (3) has the first term of opposite sign with respect to the analogous term in the previous equation and
an additional removal term of detected individuals. Although the removal of an undetected individual happens
only through healing (direct death without a transition
to d can be as a first approximation neglected), while
the removal of a detected individual can be due to both
healing and death, we chose to remove detected and undetected individuals with equal rate, leading to Eq. (4),
to reduce the number of parameters. Equation (5) represents the dynamics of the available number of kits. The
first term in the equation represents a constant growth
of the number of kits (fixed production of kits per day).
The second term reasonably assumes that kits are used
proportionally to the number of undetected individuals
and the number of available kits, and also prevents the
number of kits to become negative. The parameter  > 1
measures how many more tests have to be done to switch
an undetected individual to detected, so that the corresponding term in the equation has to be equal or larger
than the corresponding term δuk in Eqs. (2) and (3).
Of course there can be higher order contributions in
all equations, however in our opinion Eqs. (1)-(5) are the
simplest possible to get plausible dynamics.

MORE GENERAL MODELS FOR
DETECTION

An alternative model for detection can be obtained in
the following way. First, let us assume that for each
time increment ∆K = α new kits are produced, and
that a fraction 0 < δ 0 < 1 of available kits K is used for
people accepted in the hospitals. This means that the
number of kits used on hospitalized people is δ 0 K. On
the other hand the fraction of people arriving at hospitals
with symptoms is proportional to fraction of undetected
therefore δ 0 = δu. Moreover, let us assume that each of
these newly detected individuals had previously infected
other βs susceptible individuals (β < 1). Therefore we
could expect that the number of newly detected is
∆D = δuK(1 + βs) = uΦ(K, sδ, β)
∆d = ∆D/N = uφ(k, s, δ, β) .

(6)
(7)

where
φ(k, s, δ, β) = Φ(K, sδ, β)/N = δk(1 + βs) .
Consequently, the model equations now become:
ṡ = −βsu
u̇ = βsu − uφ − γu
d˙ = uφ − γd

(8)
(9)

ṙ = γ(u + d)

(10)
(11)

k̇ = α − φ .

(12)

Alternative and more complex coupling terms between
detected and undetected individuals, leading to different
coupling functions φ, can in principle be possible. Let us
call δ to be the parameter that describes the efficiency of
the detection process in all different models. Two possibilities are
uφ(uδ−1 , k) = uδ k ,

(13)

which is a term often used in chemical kinetics in A +
B → C [13], and
uφ(k, s, u, δ) = k

u
δs + u

law onset of epidemics.

which is also typical in the kinetics of chemical reactions
[13]. As δ < 1, the interpretation is that each unit of
kits will be used on either susceptible or undetected people, but undetected individuals are more probable to be
tested, therefore δ reduces the susceptible cohort. The
number of new detected subjects in a single time-step
is given by the ratio between u and the total fraction
of individuals subjected to tests (which can be either
susceptible or undetected). The rate of finding is then
proportional to k and this factor.
In Eq. (10) we have assumed that spreading of disease and testing happen at the same time. More realistic
model could include expected incubation time τ and then
the term would become delayed with
δuk(1 + βs(t − τ )) = uφ(k, s, β, τ ).

substantial agreement with results by Maier and Brockman [14]. The reason for this initial behavior is very
similar to what studied in their model in the sense that
there is a reduction of the epidemic spreading for those
individual that enter into this new compartment. This is
also checked from the analytical point of view and an expression very similar to the one found in [14] is obtained.
Indeed at the start of epidemics, we can safely assume
s ≈ 1 in Eq. (2).
However one can see that the fraction of infected individuals in such a power-law regime, multiplied for instance by the Italian population predicts less than one
single individual, and therefore this very initial theoretical regime is unobserved in real data for practically all
countries. On the contrary, in Figure 3 one can see that
for a wide range of parameters values a successive exponential growth is obtained as expected in any epidemics
diffusion. In this respect it is noteworthy that SIR model
at the start of epidemics exhibits an exponential increase
of infected ∼ e(β−γ)t , while the number of undetected in
our SUDR+K model at this stage of the epidemics grows
as ∼ e(β−φ−γ)t . The fraction of detected individuals on
the other hand grows slower than the infected ones in
comparable SIR model, thus possibly significantly affecting the measurement of epidemic parameters. .

(15)

All the above terms can be collected in a single function
uφ(u, k, δ, β, s) ,

(16)

that we will use in the following.

RESULTS

Whichever model we choose, we qualitatively observe
the same qualitative behavior. We therefore report in
the figures the results for the original model defined by
Eqs. (1)-(5). Generally speaking, we find a difference
both in size and temporal position between the two peaks
of detected and undetected individuals, as shown in Figure 1. Depending on the values of the parameters, sizes
and time ordering of the two peaks vary, but the peak of
undetected individuals is always higher than the peak of
detected ones.
In Figure 2 we show that, for the chosen values of the
parameters, at the very beginning the growth of detected
subjects is well fit by a power-law with exponent ≈ 2 in

FIG. 3. Fraction of detected individuals as function of time
for parameters β = ln 2/2.7, γ = ln 2/7, α = 7.1429 · 10−5 ,
 = 2. After an initial power-law increase, the epidemics
shows an exponential increase. Notice that the exponential
for the detected is lower than the one which would describe
beginning of epidemic in SIR model.

One of the most interesting aspects of our new model
is the appearance of two different peaks in the dynamical evolution of the fractions of the two sub-classes of
infected people, undetected and detected. The peak related to undetected individuals is in general occurring
before the peak of detected ones. The earlier the peak
of detected happens, the smaller the number of total infected at the end of the epidemics. We have found a very
interesting relationship between the time tD,max at which
the peak of detected occurs and the parameter α giving

4
the production rate of the testing kits:
tD,max ∼ α−η .

(17)

The value of exponent in Figure 17 is approximately η ≈
2, but different values of it are found for different values
of the other parameters. The power law relation is very
clear in Figure 4. In all cases the higher α, the smaller
tD,max .

FIG. 5. For the usual choice of parameters β = ln 2/2.7,
γ = 0.099, δ = 10,  = 2, we see bi-stability of the time
evolution of the epidemic diffusion, fractions u and d, at two
different but very close values of the rate α. We observe a
strong response of the system jumping from a phase of full
blown epidemics to an almost disappearing one.

FIG. 4. Scaling behavior of the peak time tD,max of detected
fraction with growth rate α of testing kit production. The
other parameters are set as it follows: β = ln 2 and γ = 0.099,
 = 2. The scaling can be well fitted by a power law (17).

However, the most striking result of our model is represented by Figures 5 and 6.
In Figure 5, for very realistic values of α, we observe
a switching behavior between two phases, one with a full
blow epidemics, and the other one in which the epidemic
diffusion practically disappears before the development
of a macroscopic spreading across the population. The
separation between this two different behaviors appears
to be a real bifurcation point. Indeed, by fixing all other
parameters, we observe the switching between such an
explosive and a self-contained behaviors for values of α
which are very close one to each other. This strongly
suggests the possibility of a huge effect on the epidemics
diffusion even for a change of few percentiles of the number of new available testing kits per day.
In Figure 6, we can see a similar bifurcation behavior between a full blow epidemics, and another regime in
which epidemics diffusion stays limited and then vanishes, by fixing all parameters but δ which is freely
moved. Again we observe a dramatic change of the epidemic diffusion in a very narrow range of the parameter
δ. These observations strongly suggest that the coupling
between kits and the fractions of undetected and detected
individuals is crucial for the possible evolution of the epidemics.
Since a similar behavior is observed also for other kinds
of coupling, introduced in Sect. II, we now give a more
general argument on Eq. (2) to explain this behavior. Let
us start from the simplest case Eqs. (1)-(5) and focus on

FIG. 6. Fraction of undetected infected individuals u as function of time at two very close values for δ, while the other
parameter are set at the following values: β = ln (2)/2.7,
γ = 0.099, α = 7.14 · 10−5 ,  = 2. We again observe bistability and a strong response of the system to small variations of δ determining an abrupt jump from a phase of full
blown epidemics to an almost disappearing one.

the temporal location of the maximum of the fraction of
undetected infected individuals. It is obtained by solving
the equation u̇(tc ) = 0, which, through Eq. (2)
s(tc ) =

γ
δ
k(tc ) + .
β
β

(18)

In Fig. 7 we represent the right hand side of the Eq. (18)
as a function of time and s(t) for the same two choices of
the parameters of Figure 6, where all parameters coincide
but δ for which we have two very close values δ1 = 36.95
and δ2 = 36.98 around the bifurcation point. We will
have a maximum in u(t) as soon as the curve of βδ k(t)+ βγ
crosses the curve of s(t). We see that for δ = δ2 the

5
crossing time 100 < tc < 150 and happens for s(t) ' 1
so that the infection is strongly limited by the testing
activity and u(t) stays very small at all time up to vanish.
On the contrary for δ = δ1 , 250 < tc < 300 and happens
for s(t) < 0.5. This means that the infection exploded
leading to a fraction larger than 0.5 of infected people
across the population. This is a further confirmation of
the switching between the two aforementioned phases of
the epidemics.
In order to generally explain this transition, we make
use of the general coupling term (16) in the model equations. As long as the function φ is strictly positive and
continuous we will have the same behavior, but with
changed temporal location of the switch. In that case
the switch will arise naturally by setting u̇(tc ) = 0 which,
from Eq. (2), means through the solution tc of the equation :
φ(u(tc ), k(tc ), α, δ) = βs(tc ) − γ

(19)

In order to proceed to a classification of the two phases,
we have to study the second order time derivative of the
fraction of undetected individuals ü:
ü(tc ) = β ṡ(tc )u(tc ) − u(tc )φ̇(tc ) .

(20)

Clearly tc will be the time of a local maximum if ü(tc ) <
0. This happens if
β ṡ(tc ) < φ̇(tc )

(21)

when the growth of the undetected sub-population is suppressed. Equation (21) says that the change of the rate
βs at which new undetected (i.e. new infected) are produced has to be smaller than the change of the rate φ at
which new undetected are discovered by test and moved
to the detected sub-population.

IV.

DISCUSSION

A simple interpretation of this result is that when the
rate of successful testing and the rate of recovery equals
the rate of transmission of the infection (i.e. transformation of individuals from susceptible to the infected state),
and the changes of this rates also coincide, the pandemic
enters into a dynamical stationary state. Note that this
does not mean that there are no newly infected, but simply that the number of new undetected per day is kept
below a certain value. When the two rates equate, we
have a clear separation between the region with small
and manageable population of u and a full blow up of
the epidemics. The repercussion of this result is that
testing can have an immense impact if it is done in time,
in a smart calibrated pace on the rate of transmission of
the infection in the population, and tests are made available at a sufficient rate. Indeed it is important to stress
that the way Singapore handled the Covid-19 crisis [15],
at least in the first round of the infection, is very similar

FIG. 7. We represent both s(t) and βδ k(t) + βγ as function
of time for the same parameters values of Figure 6: β =
ln (2)/2.7, γ = 0.099, α = 7.14 · 10−5 ,  = 2, and two choices
of δ, δ1 = 36.95 and δ2 = 36.98. The fraction u(t) gets its
maximum when the two curves cross. We see that for δ = δ2
the infection is always well limited by the testing activity up
to disappear, while for δ = δ1 the epidemics explodes up to
infect more half of population.

to our model. Moreover Japan and Hong Kong are also
managing well the diffusion of the epidemics during the
writing of this paper: indeed α = 0.0002, as reported for
the Hong Kong case [16], is within the meaningful range
of parameters we used in this model. This leads us to believe that those developed countries which are adopting
testing policies postponing a widespread testing activity
until they have full blown epidemics, put themselves in a
very risky situation in which epidemics diffuse with poor
control across the population. This result would also suggest that sharing of tests among nations is fundamental
in order to mitigate the epidemics diffusion.
In the end we would like to once again stress that here
we present toy model which is not calibrated and suitable
to any kind of quantitative predictions. We believe that
the testing strategy, and the modeling of detection of
cases is of fundamental importance for the epidemics of
COVID19 as well as for all possible future epidemics of
unknown pathogens, and we hope this work can open
the way to collaborate with institutions and researchers
which are working on real testing to model it as best as
possible.
