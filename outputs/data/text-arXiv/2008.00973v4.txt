Abstract

A mathematical model for estimating the risk of airborne transmission of a respiratory infection such as
COVID-19, is presented. The model employs basic concepts from fluid dynamics and incorporates the
known scope of factors involved in the airborne transmission of such diseases. Simplicity in the
mathematical form of the model is by design, so that it can serve not only as a common basis for scientific
inquiry across disciplinary boundaries, but also be understandable by a broad audience outside science
and academia. The caveats and limitations of the model are discussed in detail. The model is used to
assess the protection from transmission afforded by face coverings made from a variety of fabrics. The
reduction in transmission risk associated with increased physical distance between the host and
susceptible is also quantified by coupling the model with available data on scalar dispersion in canonical
flows. Finally, the effect of the level of physical activity (or exercise intensity) of the host and the
susceptible in enhancing transmission risk, is also assessed.

Introduction

COVID-19 spread across the world with a speed and intensity that laid bare the limits of our understanding
of the transmission pathways and the associated factors that are key to the spread of such diseases. There
is however an emerging consensus that ‚Äúairborne transmission,‚Äù where virion bearing respiratory droplets
and droplet nuclei (also called respiratory aerosols) expelled by an infected person (the ``host'') are
inhaled by a ‚Äúsusceptible‚Äù individual, constitutes an important mode for the spread of COVID-191‚Äì5.
Questions regarding the size of the droplets involved6‚Äì9 and the range of such transmission10 can be
bypassed by noting that the key element that differentiates airborne transmission from the droplet and
contact routes of transmission11 is the essential role of inhalation by the susceptible in this pathway for
transmission. Generally, it is the small (<10 Œºm) particles that are likely to be entrained into the inhalation
current of a person, but environmental conditions as well as the proximity between the host and the
susceptible could allow larger particles/droplets to play a role in airborne transmission.
Irrespective of the size of droplets or the range involved, airborne transmission of COVID-19 and other
respiratory infections involve the following sequence of events (see Fig. 1):
1. generation, expulsion and aerosolization of virus-containing droplets from the mouth and nose of an
infected host;
2. dispersion and transport via ambient air currents of this respiratory aerosol to a susceptible; and
3. inhalation of droplets/aerosols, and deposition of virus in the respiratory mucosa of the susceptible.
Each phase in this sequence has complex dependencies on a variety of factors that may include the
morphological properties and pathogenicity of the virus, the health status of the host and/or the
susceptible, environmental conditions, and the presence/effectiveness of face coverings being used by

the host and/or susceptible. Given this complexity of phenomenology and the many factors involved, it is
not surprising that even after more than 8 months of the world dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic,
there are fundamental questions that continue to confound scientists, policy makers and the members of
the public at-large. These include questions such as: what factors have enabled the SARS-CoV-2 to spread
so much faster and more extensively than other similar viruses in the recent past12,13? Why is the rate of
infection so different in different regions/countries of the world14? How much lower is the likelihood of
transmission in an outdoor environment compared to an indoor environment10,15? How do policies and
societal behavior such as compliance with mask wearing affect the rate of transmission16,17? And finally,
how does transmission risk reduce with distance between the host and the susceptible?

Figure 1. Schematic depicting the key stages in the airborne transmission of a respiratory infection such as
COVID-19.

Scientists spanning fields such as biomedicine, epidemiology, virology, public health, fluid dynamics,
aerosol physics, public policy, behavioral psychology, and others, are tackling these as well as other
important questions. However, what is lacking is a simple and intuitive conceptual framework (or model)
that encapsulates the complex, multifactorial scope of this problem in a manner that not only serves as a
common basis for scientific inquiry across disciplinary boundaries, but also as a tool to more easily
communicate the factors associated with the spread of this disease, to a wide range of stakeholders
including non-scientists such as policy-makers, public media, and the public at-large. Given the rapidly
evolving nature of the pandemic and the resurgence of infections in many commmunities18, the
importance of clear communication of infection risk across scientific disciplines, as well as to
policy/decision makers and other segments of society, is more important than ever.

The Contagion Airborne Transmission (CAT) Inequality

In 1961, Dr. Frank Drake, an astronomer and astrophysicist involved in the search for extraterrestrial
intelligence, conceived a conceptual framework to predict the number of technological civilizations that
2

may exist in our galaxy. The Drake Equation19,20, as it has become known, involves a number of
probabilistic factors, which when multiplied together, result in the number of civilizations within our
galaxy, at any given moment, that humanity could communicate with. The power of this equation is not
in that it actually allows us to predict this number with a known level of certainty, but in the fact that it
provides an easy to understand framework for grasping the key factors involved in something that seems
inestimable: the number of advanced lifeforms that exist elsewhere in our galaxy.
Motivated by the Drake Equation, and based on the idea that airborne transmission occurs if a susceptible
inhales a viral dose that exceeds the minimum infectious dose21,22, the following model to predict the
possibility of airborne transmission of a respiratory contagion such as SARS-CoV-2 from an infected host
to a susceptible, is proposed:

Rate of arrival of host-generated
aerosol-borne virions, in the
vicinity of the susceptible

The CAT inequality is a mathematical model for the estimation of infection risk that can be used based on
various interpretations of its constituent terms. For example, if ùëÖùëÖÃáùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°ùë° and ùëÅùëÅùêºùêºùêºùêº are known, then the CAT
inequality allows one to deduce the critical exposure time ùëáùëáùë†ùë†ùë†ùë† = ùëÅùëÅùêºùêºùêºùêº /ùëÖùëÖÃáùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°ùë° below which infection is
unlikely. Most often in practice, however, not all of the factors in the inequality will be known. Still, the
CAT inequality can be used to compare relative risks since one may consider the risk of a situation to be
inversely proportional to the corresponding critical exposure time (e.g. halving critical exposure time
doubles the risk). For example, the risk ratio for two situations A and B will be ùëáùëáùë†ùë†ùë†ùë†‚àíùêµùêµ /ùëáùëáùë†ùë†ùë†ùë†‚àíùê¥ùê¥ =
ùëÖùëÖÃáùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°‚àíùê¥ùê¥ /ùëÖùëÖÃáùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°‚àíùêµùêµ . Thus, if e.g. all factors are equal for A and B except for one, e.g. ùëìùëìùëöùëö‚Ñéùê¥ùê¥ ‚â† ùëìùëìùëöùëö‚Ñéùêµùêµ (say), then
the risk ratio comparing A to B will be ùëìùëìùëöùëö‚Ñéùê¥ùê¥ /ùëìùëìùëöùëö‚Ñéùêµùêµ . In Sec. 8 we will illustrate such relative risk estimations
for three specific cases.
The use of mathematical models to predict infection rates is well-established in epidemiology21,23,24 and
the CAT inequality belongs among such models (see Sec. 8 for discussion on relationship to existing
modeling frameworks). As with any model, the CAT inequality has a number of underlying assumptions
(see Sec. 9) but its potential advantage is that it presents transmission risk via a simple mathematical
expression that on one hand, captures a wide scope of factors that may be involved in airborne
transmission, and on the other, is easy to convey to scientists from a wide range of fields, non-scientists
such as policy makers, public officials, and public media, as well as even members of the general public.

As laid out in a previous publication,11 each stage in the airborne transmission process is mediated by
complex flow phenomena, ranging from air-mucous interaction and liquid sheet fragmentation inside the
respiratory tract, to turbulence in the expiratory jet/ambient flow and flow-induced droplet evaporation
and particle dispersion, to inhalation and deposition of aerosols in the lungs. Furthermore, nonpharmaceutical approaches employed to mitigate respiratory infections such as social distancing and the
wearing of face masks, are also rooted in the principles of fluid dynamics. Thus, fluid dynamics is central
to all important physical aspects of the airborne transmission of respiratory infections such as COVID-19,
and it therefore stands to reason that this connection to flow physics will appear in any successful model
of airborne transmission. In the sections that follow, we provide additional details about the key variables
involved in the CAT inequality, with special emphasis on the intervening fluid dynamical phenomena. This
is followed by the application of the model to assess transmission risk associated with face mask use,
physical distancing, and exercise intensity. Finally, we describe the caveats associated with this model and
summarize the study.

Host Related Variables

The CAT inequality (Fig. 2) naturally segregates into three sets of variables: the first set depends primarily
on the host, the second on the environment, and the third, on the susceptible. We now describe the
factors that each of these variables depend on, as well as our state of knowledge regarding each variable.
ùëÖùëÖÃá‚Ñé is the rate of expulsion of respiratory droplets from the nose and mouth of the host, and is one of the
most extensively studied parameters within the arena of airborne transmission6,7,9,25‚Äì28. Droplets are
4

formed from the mucus and saliva that lines our respiratory and oropharyngeal tracts, and these droplets
are expelled with the air that is exhaled out of our mouth and nose. Studies have shown that individuals
generate more droplets for the same expiratory activity while ill with a respiratory infection than after
recovery26,29, and this may be related to enhanced mucous production during illness. While the
conventional notion is that sneezing has the highest rate of droplet generation followed by coughing,
talking7,30 and breathing6 (in that order), the very large scatter in measured data6,25,31 makes it difficult to
validate this notion. Attention during the ongoing pandemic has focused on droplet generation during
talking and breathing7,8,25 due to the recognition that viral shedding from asymptomatic/presymptomatic
individuals (who are not coughing or sneezing) may be an important differentiator in the high spreading
rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to earlier coronavirus outbreaks2,32.
For activities such as breathing and talking, it could be appropriate to express ùëÖùëÖÃá‚Ñé as the product of the
volume expiration (i.e. ventilation) rate of the host, (ùëâùëâÃáùê∏ùê∏‚Ñé ) and the number density of droplets (i.e. droplets
per unit volume) in the exhaled gas (ùëõùëõùëëùëë‚Ñé ). This is because for a given individual, ùëõùëõùëëùëë‚Ñé might not vary
significantly during activities such as breathing, and ùëÖùëÖÃá‚Ñé would therefore increase linearly with the
ventilation (i.e. exhalation) rate ùëâùëâÃáùê∏ùê∏‚Ñé . The ventilation rate for an adult can range from about 100 ml.s-1 at
rest to 2000 ml.s-1 during intense exercise33. Measured values of ùëõùëõùëëùëë‚Ñé for breathing34 are about 0.1 ml-1
and this suggests that ùëÖùëÖÃá‚Ñé for breathing could range from about 10 to 200 droplets per second depending
on the ventilation rate. Values of ùëõùëõùëëùëë‚Ñé during normal speech in the same experiment were found to be
about two to eight times higher, and other studies have found that droplet emission increases with the
loudness of speech7. Finally, recent attention has focused on ‚Äúsuper producers,‚Äù: individuals who
according to some studies, generate droplets at rates that are 10 or more times higher than others29,35.
Thus, even for normal breathing, ùëÖùëÖÃá‚Ñé could range from about 10 to 2000 s-1 depending on the exhalation
rate and the emission phenotype of the individual, and speech could increase the upper range by another
order of magnitude. Thus, phenotype and expiratory activity of the host alone could increase the
transmission risk by a factor of 1000 or more.
ùëìùëìùë£ùë£‚Ñé is the fractional viral load of a respiratory droplet and there is currently no data on this variable for
SARS-CoV-2. Indirect measures based on volume concentration of viral load in oral fluid samples collected
from COVID-19 patients combined with simple volumetric estimates have been used to suggest that 37%
of 50 Œºm size droplets and 0.37% of 10 Œºm size droplets would contain virions30. No confirmation of these
estimates from direct measurement of respiratory aerosols is available so far, and there is evidence that
suggests that these simple volume-fraction based estimates might significantly underestimate the viral
load of the small (<5 Œºm) droplets27. Furthermore, the fractional viral load also likely depends on the
location in the respiratory tract from where the droplet originates because pathogens tend to colonize
specific regions of the respiratory tract and the surface area density of the mucus volume varies
throughout the respiratory tract36. There is, however, no quantification of this effect. We note that
employing even a low-end estimate of say a 0.5% fractional viral load (i.e. ùëìùëìùë£ùë£‚Ñé = 0.005), combined with
200,000 droplets/cough26, would result in the shedding of 1000 virions in each cough, and this could be
equivalent to the minimum infectious dose (see discussion in Sec. 6) for COVID-19.
ùëìùëìùëéùëé‚Ñé is the fraction of expelled droplets that aerosolize, i.e. get suspended in the air. It is generally found
that droplets smaller than about 10 Œºm can remain suspended in the air whereas droplets larger than 50
Œºm fall to the ground rapidly34,37‚Äì39. Thus, the size distribution of the expelled droplets is a key determinant
of ùëìùëìùëéùëé‚Ñé . A number of studies have examined the distribution of droplet size expelled during various
expiratory activities6,7,9,25‚Äì28 and these studies show that droplet size can vary from 0.01 to 1000 microns.
5

The consensus is that breathing generates the smallest particles, with talking, coughing, and sneezing
generating increasingly larger droplets (in that order)40. There is however a large scatter in this data, and
this might be due to subject-specific differences41 as well as the changes in mucosal fluid induced by the
pathogen40. Finally, the fluid in the expelled droplets also evaporates rapidly, resulting in a reduction in
size, and this rate of evaporation may depend on prevailing conditions of temperature and humidity near
the host, as well as the velocity of the droplets. These dependencies can, however, be determined, for
the most part, from first principles38,42.

Environment Dependent Variables

ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé represents the fraction of aerosolized respiratory aerosol droplets/droplet nuclei from the infected
host that are transported to the immediate vicinity of the susceptible, and this is one variable where
environmental factors play a dominant role. These include air currents, turbulence, temperature, and
humidity. Ambient air currents in particular, determine the ‚Äútime-of-flight‚Äù as well as the dilution in
concentration of the bioaerosol that arrives near the susceptible.
Even though we know the dependencies of the variable ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé , it is still a difficult variable to estimate since
environmental factors can be so highly variable43. For example, even for a host and susceptible in the
same room, this variable could change significantly given the relative location of the two individuals, the
operational status of the air conditioning, and the location of the individuals relative to the air
conditioning diffusers and vents15,44,45. The estimation of this parameter becomes even more difficult in
indoor spaces such as buildings where rooms share a high-volume air conditioning (HVAC) system. In highdensity indoor spaces such as classrooms, aircraft cabins, gyms, buses, trains, etc., anthropogenic effects
generated due to human movement and body heat generated thermal plumes46,47 could also have a
significant effect on this variable. The effects of indoor ventilation fluid dynamics on COVID-19
transmission have been recently reviewed48.
Estimation of ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé in outdoor environments presents a different challenge. While these outdoor
environments do not have confining boundaries and localized inflow/outflow regions that dominate the
flow patterns, effects due to atmospheric turbulence49,50, local wind and weather conditions, convection
effects due to thermal gradients, and other environmental factors have to be taken into account.
Furthermore, even in outdoor settings, the presence of high human density (such as at sporting events,
social gatherings etc.) could introduce significant anthropogenic effects on the dispersion and transport
of respiratory aerosols.
As the aerosol plume from the host travels downstream, it spreads due to diffusion, entrainment, and
turbulence-induced mixing. This results in a direction-dependent drop in concentration (aerosol particles
per unit volume) with distance from the host. To further understand how this enters the estimation of the
variable ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé , we introduce the variable ùëâùëâùë†ùë† , which is the volume of air surrounding the face of the
susceptible that would be inhaled by the susceptible (see Fig. 3). If the aerosol concentration near the
host is ùê∂ùê∂ùëúùëú and the mean concentration in the volume ùëâùëâùë†ùë† at a distance of ùê∑ùê∑‚Ñéùë†ùë† is ùê∂ùê∂ùë†ùë†ÃÖ , then ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé due to this
dilution in concentration can be expressed as ùê∂ùê∂ùë†ùë†ÃÖ /ùê∂ùê∂ùëúùëú . The volume ùëâùëâùë†ùë† can be estimated given the inspiratory
status of the susceptible (see discussion of ùëìùëìùëñùëñùëñùëñ ) but in the current model, a choice for ùëâùëâùë†ùë† that eliminates
dependence of this variable on the susceptible, is the maximum possible volume of air that can be inhaled
by an adult per second, which is about 2 liters33. Thus, ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé can be estimated under these assumptions if
ùê∂ùê∂ùë†ùë†ÃÖ /ùê∂ùê∂ùëúùëú is known or can be estimated. We point out that the ‚Äòexposure index‚Äô of Liu et al.51 is defined in a
similar way, and in their study, is estimated using computational modeling. It is also noted that ùê∂ùê∂ùëúùëú could
6

be expressed in term of the ratio of the particle expulsion rate to the exhalation rate of the host as ùê∂ùê∂ùëúùëú =
ùëÖùëÖÃá‚Ñé /ùëâùëâÃá‚Ñé .

A number of studies have measured the spreading rate of the exhalation jets formed from various
expiratory activities 52‚Äì54 and this spreading rate with downstream distance can vary significantly for
breathing, talking and coughing. External flow currents and thermal convection33 effects, will however
deform the shape of the expiratory plume and may enhance non-uniformity in the concentration of the
respiratory aerosols within the jet. Quantifying the effect of all these factors is the key challenge in
estimating ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé . In Sec. 8, we will employ canonical computational models of scalar dispersion to provide
estimates of the protection factor associated with physical distancing in several scenarios.

ùëìùëìùë£ùë£ùë£ùë£ represents the fraction of respiratory aerosol particles from the infected host that arrive in the
immediate vicinity of the susceptible with viable virions. Ambient air currents determine the ‚Äútime-offlight‚Äù of the aerosol particles, and this combines with temperature, humidity and UV exposure to
determine the viability of the virions carried in the aerosols. A study has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virion
can stay viable in aerosol form for 3 or more hours13, but high temperature55 and sunlight/UV exposure56,57
are both detrimental to virion viability. Humidity, on the other hand, has a more complex effect on the
viability of airborne viruses. For instance, three regimes of Influenza A virus viability in droplets, defined
by relative humidity (RH), have been postulated: high viability at physiological (~100% RH) and dry (< 50%
RH) conditions, and lower viability when intermediate humidity (50% - 100% RH) exists in combination
with high concentrations of naturally occurring biochemical solutes in the droplet58. This complex
dependency on humidity is likely one factor that has made it difficult to correlate transmission risk with
regional and seasonal variations in environmental conditions59. In general ùëìùëìùë£ùë£ùë£ùë£ can be modeled as ùëíùëí ‚àíùëáùëá/ùúèùúè
where T is the time-of-flight and ùúèùúè is the half-life of virions in aerosolized form, which depends on the
virus, as well as the temperature, humidity and UV exposure. A number of recent studies have measured
ùúèùúè for SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of settings13,56.

Susceptible Related Variables

ùëìùëìùëñùëñùëñùëñ is the fraction of bioaerosols from the host in the vicinity of the susceptible that would be inhaled and
deposited in the respiratory tract of a susceptible not wearing a face covering. This variable primarily
depends on the inspiratory status of the susceptible. At rest, an adult human inhales about 100 ml of air
per second60 but this value can go up 20 fold during intense exercise33. Within the context of the current
model, ùëìùëìùëñùëñùëñùëñ could be estimated as the ratio of the susceptible‚Äôs inspiratory rate to the maximum possible
Ãá
inspiratory rate for a human (we denote this maximum ventilation rate as ùëâùëâùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö
.), which can be assumed
33
to be 2000 ml/second . We note that the volume here is the same as ùëâùëâùë†ùë† in the previous section. With this
prescription, ùëìùëìùëñùëñùëñùëñ for the average healthy adult male could vary from 0.05 during rest to 1.0 during intense
exercise. Beyond the exercise state of the individual, tidal volume (volume inhaled per breath) and
ventilation rate also depend on age61, gender, body weight62,63 and the respiratory health of the person,
and these factors can be easily accounted for in ùëìùëìùëñùëñùëñùëñ . For instance, measured values of ventilation rates for
women are about 20% lower than for men62 and this would translate to a 20% reduction in ùëìùëìùëñùëñùëñùëñ for women.
Similarly, short adults can have resting inspiratory rates that are about 20% lower than tall adults62 and
this would result in a proportionate reduction in ùëìùëìùëñùëñùëñùëñ . Inspiration rates for preteens can be three-fold lower
than adults61 and this would also reduce ùëìùëìùëñùëñùëñùëñ proportionately. Thus, differential inspiration rates could play
a role in the age and body-weight associated COVID-19 prevalence disparities noted in recent studies64,65.
The effect of physical activity-associated changes in ventilation rates on transmission risk is examined in
Sec. 8.
ùëÅùëÅùêºùêºùêºùêº is the infectious dose for airborne transmission. In the arena of infectious diseases, the infectious
dose is often expressed as HID5022, which is the minimum infectious dose required to initiate infection in
50% of inoculated humans. This number is usually obtained via controlled studies where human
volunteers are exposed to different viral loads. However, such studies are not available for potentially
lethal viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Studies on the infectious dose for Influenza A indicate a HID50 of
O(1000) virus particles22,66. Studies of MERS-CoV in mice found a similar infectious dose67, so the HID50 for
humans accounting for the larger body weight, could be two or more orders-of-magnitudes higher. It is
important to note that for Influenza A, infectivity via aerosols has been found to be O(105) higher than via
a nasopharyngeal (i.e. nasal swab) route,68 highlighting the exceptional effectiveness of the airborne route
for transmission of respiratory infections. Infectivity of airborne viruses also depends on the carrier
droplet size. Small (~2 Œºm) droplets deposit deeper in the lungs and have been shown to be two or more
orders of magnitude more infective than larger (>10 Œºm) droplets69. Finally, the infectious dose might also
depend on the age and health status (including the level of immunity to infection) of the susceptible.
Determination of ùëÅùëÅùêºùêºùêºùêº for SARS-CoV-2 remains one of the most important tasks for scientists working in
this arena.
The remaining variable ùëáùëáùë†ùë† is the duration of exposure of the susceptible to the aerosols from the host.
Based on the CAT inequality, if all other conditions remain stationary, the total number of viable virions
transmitted is directly proportional to the exposure duration. Transmission is successful when this viral
dose equals or exceeds the infectious dose (i.e. when ùëáùëáùë†ùë† ‚â• ùëáùëáùë†ùë†ùë†ùë† ).

Face Coverings

Face coverings appear in the two factors ùëìùëìùëöùëö‚Ñé and ùëìùëìùëöùëöùëöùëö as fractions of aerosols/droplets that pass through
the face coverings of the host and susceptible, respectively, and there is much data available to estimate
these variables. These face covering-related variables depend on two factors ‚Äì the material of the face
8

covering and the fit of the face covering on the face of the individual. A perfectly fit N95 face mask for
instance, stops 95% or more of the particles that go through it and ùëìùëìùëöùëö would therefore be equal to 0.05
for such a mask. Thus, the wearing of a well-fit N95 mask by either the host or the susceptible could reduce
the transmission risk by a factor of 20. Furthermore, if both individuals are wearing such masks, the
transmission risk, according to the CTA inequality, could reduce by a factor of 400.
Surgical masks have been measured to block 30% to 60% of respiratory aerosols70,71 and in another study,
a surgical mask reduced aerosol shedding of Influenza A virions from infected hosts by a factor of 3.4.28
This suggests that even surgical masks worn by both the host and the susceptible could reduce
transmission risk by factors ranging from about 2 to 10. Another recent study of viral shedding with and
without surgical face masks from patients with Influenza, coronavirus (SARS) and rhinovirus provides clear
evidence of the ability of such face covering to reduce transmissibility of the virus72. Finally, we point out
that even home-made cloth masks provide some protection against airborne infections71, and in Sec 8,
we will examine this in more detail for a range of fabrics.
The fitment of the mask is important for overall protection since a loose-fitting mask with perimeter leaks
allows unfiltered aerosols to bypass the mask73. Leaks are a particular problem for outward protection
(i,e, reducing emission of respiratory aerosols by the infected host) since the process of expiration pushes
the mask outwards and enhances perimeter leaks11,74,75.
Finally, in addition to filtering aerosol particles, face covering also reduce the velocity of exhalation jet74,76
This could increase the expansion angle of respiratory jet and reduce the initial penetration distance of
the respiratory droplets,77 thereby altering ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé . For instance, a recent study found that the fabric in some
face coverings might facilitate the breakup of large droplets into smaller ones78, and in doing so, increase
ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé , thereby increasing transmission risk.

Model Predictions

The model is now applied to address three distinct questions: what protection is afforded by different
face coverings; how does risk decrease with increased physical distance between the host and susceptible,
and finally, to what degree does the level of physical activity, as manifested in the ventilation rates of the
host and/or the susceptible, affect transmission risk.
Protection Afforded by Face Coverings: We start with the effect of facemasks and employ data from
Zangmeister et al. 71 on the filtration efficiency (FE) of common fabrics used in respiratory face masks.
These authors examined more than 30 different fabrics and quantified the filtration efficiency for droplet
sizes ranging from particle mobility diameters between 50 and 825 nm. Given that aerosol transmission
may involve droplet sizes ranging up to 5 Œºm, we have estimated the lower and upper bounds of the
ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ ) for particle sizes ranging from 50 nm to 5 Œºm (see procedure in the
average filtration efficiency (ùêπùêπùêπùêπ
Appendix). The fraction of aerosols/droplets that pass through the face coverings is then given by ùëìùëìùëöùëö =
1 ‚àí ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ
ùêπùêπùêπùêπ /100. Given these values and the assumption that the filtration efficiency is the same for inward
as well as outward protection (i.e. ùëìùëìùëöùëö‚Ñé = ùëìùëìùëöùëöùëöùëö = ùëìùëìùëöùëö ) we can now estimate the unilateral protection factor
(PF) if either the host or the susceptible wears this mask, as PF = ùëìùëìùëöùëö‚àí1. The corresponding bilateral
protection factor, i.e. when both individuals wear masks, is then given by PF = ùëìùëìùëöùëö‚àí2. These PFs normalized
by the corresponding situation where neither individual is wearing a mask, are plotted in Fig. 4 for selected
cases from Zangmeister et al71.
Given the large uncertainties in estimates of the protection factor derived here, only general conclusions
regarding the face masks are drawn here. First, a number of simple fabrics (Cotton 4, Cotton 14, and
9

Synthetic Blend 2), provide protection factors that are similar or better than the Surgical Mask sample.
Second, even the lower bound of unilateral protection for many of these samples exceeds 2.0, which
represents a significant reduction in transmission risk. Third, for bilateral protection, Cotton 4 and Syn
Blend 2 have minimum protection factors that exceed 5. Finally, the true protection factors for these
fabrics are likely significantly higher than the lower bounds established here. Indeed, if we average the
upper and lower bounds of ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ
ùêπùêπùêπùêπ for the four most effective fabrics/samples (Cotton 4, Cotton 14, Synthetic
Blend 2, and Surgical Mask), we obtain an aggregate filtration efficiency of 63%, which would correspond
to a unilateral(bilateral) protection factor of 2.7(7.3). Thus, simple facemasks made from any of these
fabrics/materials could significantly lower overall transmission rates. This effectiveness of facemasks is
being corroborated by recent epidemiological16 and animal79 studies of COVID-19 transmission. We point
out that the above analysis ignores perimeter leaks, which can significantly deteriorate the effectiveness
of face masks11. The analysis also does not account for unsteady and velocity dependent effects of
expiratory events on the filtration efficiency74.

Figure 4. Estimation of protection from aerosol transmission afforded by the donning of face coverings based
on published filtration efficiency data of Zangmeister et al.71 for 34 different fabrics/samples. The protection
factor (PF) is a quantity that is normalized by the risk of transmission associated with the situation when neither
the host nor the susceptible wears a mask.

Protection due to Physical Distancing: The model is used next to examine the protection from transmission
afforded by physical distance between the host and the susceptible in an outdoor environment. As
mentioned earlier, the distance between the host and the susceptible is a dominant factor in the variable
ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé associated with the transport of virion-bearing aerosols. However, estimates for the rate at which
transmission risk diminishes with distance between the host and the susceptible, are not readily available.
Here, we employ simple models of the aerosol dispersion to estimate the protection factor associated
with physical distancing.
We start by assuming that the mean concentration in the inhaled volume of the susceptible is equal to
ùê∂ùê∂ùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö ÔøΩùê∑ùê∑‚Ñéùë†ùë† ÔøΩ, where ùê∂ùê∂ùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö is the maximum concentration at any given distance from the host (see Fig. 5).

Dispersion-induced dilution at a distance of ùê∑ùê∑‚Ñéùë†ùë† would then result in ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé ~ ùê∂ùê∂ùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö (ùê∑ùê∑‚Ñéùë†ùë† )/ùê∂ùê∂ùëúùëú , and a
‚àí1
. Several scenarios for outdoor
corresponding protection factor due to physical distancing of ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé
10

transmission are considered based on various combinations of expiration velocity (ùëâùëâùëóùëó ), ambient wind
speed (ùëàùëà‚àû ) and buoyancy induced effects. We note that these models are consistent with the approach
inherent to the CAT-Inequality which assumes a sequential segregation of the various effects involved in
airborne transmission. In particular, important near-field effects such as droplet breakup and evaporation
are assumed to be accounted for in the variable ùëìùëìùëéùëé‚Ñé and are therefore not included in the droplet
dispersion models discussed in the current section.

Figure 5. Schematic showing various scenarios for which the effect of physical distancing on transmission risk
is assesed. The aerosol plume from the host consists of a near field, which can be highly variable, and a far field,
where the plume exhibits more self-similar or universal characteristics within various classes of flow. The
analysis in this section focuses on the far-field domain.

1) ùëâùëâùëóùëó and ùëàùëà‚àû are both of very low magnitudes; this could corespond to a sedentary individual
breathing at a low exhalation rate in still wind conditions. This situation can be modeled as normal
diffusion dominated dispersion, and the analytical solution for steady-state diffusion from a point source80
in an unbounded domain indicates that ùê∂ùê∂ùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö (ùë•ùë•) ~ ùë•ùë• ‚àí1 where x is the distance from the point source.
Molecular diffusion will not be relevant since it will take a long time to establish itself (on the order of
ùë°ùë°~ùë•ùë• 2 /ùõæùõæ , where ùõæùõæ is the molecular mass diffusion coefficient, typically many hours in air). However, even
relatively weak background turbulence with eddies smaller than x will generate turbulent diffusion
coefficients81 ùõæùõæùëáùëá >> ùõæùõæ and also establish a ùê∂ùê∂ùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö (ùë•ùë•) ~ ùë•ùë• ‚àí1 spatial decay.
2) ùëâùëâùëóùëó significantly exceeds ùëàùëà‚àû ; this could correspond, for instance, to a person talking or singing
(where expiratory flow speeds range up to 5 m/s 54) in still wind conditions. This situation could be
approximated as a turbulent jet in quiescent flow, and studies82 of such flows in canonical configurations
indicate that the peak concentration decays beyond the near field as ùê∂ùê∂ùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö (ùë•ùë•) ~ ùë•ùë• ‚àí1 in the direction of
the jet. This situation has been analyzed recently for speech-driven aerosol transport including timedependence83.
3) ùëàùëà‚àû significantly exceeds ùëâùëâùëóùëó ; this could correspond, for instance, to a person breathing normally
with an expiratory velocity of ~1 m/s84 on a windy day with wind velocities upwards of 10 miles per hour.
Neglecting bouyancy effects, this situation can be modeled as a horizontal plume from a point source in a
crossflow, studies85,86 suggest that ùê∂ùê∂ùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö (ùë•ùë•) ~ ùë•ùë• ‚àí3/2 beyond the near-field region.
11

4) The previous situation of a horizontal plume does not account for bouyancy effects and the data
employed does not account for the time-dependent pulsatile nature of breathing. These effects can be
included in the current model if data from appropriate computations or experiments, are available. Here
we employ data generated from a wall-modeled large-eddy simulation87 of a plume from a point source
located 1.5 m above the ground in a turbulent atmospheric boundary layer, with a mean wind velocity
corresponding to 2m/s83. The model is designed to mimic normal breathing with the scalar (representing
the respiratory aerosol) being released as puffs at regular intervals of 3 seconds. The exhaled breath is
assumed to be at a temperature of 37o C and two ambient temperature conditions are considered: 0o C
and 42o C. In the model, buoyancy effects are included using the Boussinesq approximation. The incoming
wind flow itself is assumed to be unstratified, neutrally buoyant. The reader is referred to Appendix B for
details about the methodology of the simulations.
Fig. 6a shows a plot of the instantaneous scalar concentration for the second case, and Fig 6b and c, the
time-averaged plume concentrations for both cases. As expected, the plume rises for the first case (the
‚Äòlight‚Äô plume) but descends towards the ground for the second case (‚Äòheavy‚Äô plume) due to buoyancy
effects for the very hot surrounding air case, into which the cooler and denser air is exhaled. Fig. 6d shows
the maximum concentration of the respiratory plumes as a function of distance for the two cases, and we
find that beyond about a distance of about 3 meters, the plume concentration decays consistently as
ùê∂ùê∂ùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö (ùë•ùë•) ~ (ùë•ùë• ‚àí1.2 ) and ùê∂ùê∂ùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö (ùë•ùë•) ~ ùë•ùë• ‚àí0.9 for the light and heavy plumes, respectively. Thus, the presence
of the ground as well as buoyancy has a noticeable effect on the concentration decay rate.

Fig. 7 shows the protection factors due to physical distancing for all the cases discussed above and we
note that since the y-intercepts of all the curves have been individually normalized to unity at a unit
distance, direct numerical comparison between the two conditions is not appropriate. The plot does
however indicate that in the absence of a crossflow, the protection factor increases linearly with distance,
12

whereas when the crossflow velocity is significantly larger than the exhaled jet velocity, the protection
1.5
factor increases at a faster rate of ùê∑ùê∑‚Ñéùë†ùë†
. Furthermore, buoyancy has a noticeable effect on the decay of
aerosol concentration, and the downward movement of heavy plume combined with the confinement
due to the ground, could potentially diminish the protection afforded by physical distancing. Given that
wind conditions can be highly variable, a conservative estimate from the above analysis is that physical
distancing affords approximately a linear increase in protection from transmission. The analysis also
demonstrates the use of data from computational fluid dynamics models to parameterize the model for
specific scenarios.

and susceptible for the five scenarios examined here. The protection factor is normalized for each case by the
condition where both the host and susceptible are at a unit distance. The protection factor is inversely
proportional to the decay of the maximum concentration with distance between the host and the susceptible
ùë´ùë´ùíâùíâùíâùíâ .

Level of Physical Activity and Transmission Risk: The final application of the model is to examine the
potential effect of physical/exercise intensity on the risk of transmission. This would be relevant to
settings such as gyms, sports/exercise facilities, and even gatherings/events, schools, and workplace
situations where levels of physical activity might exceed levels that are considered sedentary. Exercise
intensity enters the CAT inequality through the ventilation rates of the host and the susceptible. As
pointed out earlier, in expiratory activities such as breathing and talking, the particle expulsion rate may
be estimated as ùëÖùëÖÃá‚Ñé = ùëõùëõùëëùëë‚Ñé ùëâùëâÃáùê∏ùê∏‚Ñé where ùëõùëõùëëùëë‚Ñé is the number of droplets emitted per volume of exhaled gas
(and may be assumed to be constant for a given host) and ùëâùëâÃáùê∏ùê∏‚Ñé is the ventilation rate of the host. The
variable ùëìùëìùëñùëñùëñùëñ is equal to the rate of the susceptible‚Äôs ventilation rate divided by the maximum possible
Ãá
. Employing established definitions88 that relate exercise intensity to
ventilation rate i.e. ùëìùëìùëñùëñùëñùëñ = ùëâùëâÃáùê∏ùê∏ùê∏ùê∏ /ùëâùëâùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö
oxygen consumption rates, and further assuming proportionality between oxygen consumption rates and
Ãá
corresponding ventilation rates, and that the maximum ventilation rate ùëâùëâùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö
for adults is 2 liters/sec89,
we can estimate the increased transmission risk with exercise intensity over the sedentary condition
2Ãá , where ( )

ùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö corresponds to an adult in a sedentary
Ãá
condition. In the current estimation procedure, ùëâùëâùëöùëöùëöùëöùëöùëö is set at 100 ml/s, which is 5% of the maximum
ventilation rate, and the ventilation rates for the intermediate levels are based on measured values for
adults88.
13

Fig. 8 shows this increased transmission risk for the five exercise intensity levels and it can be seen that
even for a susceptible in a sedentary state, the transmission risk goes up by a factor of 8 if the host is at a
moderate intensity of exercise. In a settings such as shopping malls, outdoor markets, warehouses or highschools, where activity levels of hosts and susceptibles could be in the light to moderate range, increase
in transmission risk due just to increased ventilation rates, would, according to the current model, be up
to 64 times higher. In a facility such as a gym, or for instance a basketball practice, where exercise intensity
levels could be in the ‚Äúvigorous‚Äù range, transmission risk could be nearly 200 times higher due to increased
exhalation and inhalation rates of the individuals involved. A survey of existing literature indicates that
this increase in risk with physical activity level associated with various common scenarios is underappreciated.

Figure 8. Estimate of transmission risk increase due to physical activity/exercise induced increased
ventilation rates for host and susceptible. The assumed ventilation rate for each of the 5 levels is
included in the legend. The increase in transmission risk is normalized by the condition where both
the host and susceptible are sedentary (sleeping or sitting).

Comparison with other Infection Risk Models

Existing models for estimating infection risk via airborne transmission can be classified into Wells-Riley
type and dose-response models90. Within this context, the current model should be considered a doseresponse model since it explicitly makes use of the infectious dose (ùëÅùëÅùêºùêºùêºùêº ) predict infection risk. The current
model, as proposed, can further be characterized as a deterministic (as opposed to stochastic) doseresponse model since it assumes that a dose larger than the threshold dose of ùëÅùëÅùêºùêºùêºùêº results in an infection90.

The Wells-Riley type models are based on the notion of an infectious ‚Äúquantum‚Äù which is defined as the
quantity of expelled aerosol required to cause an infection in a susceptible24,21. Within the context of the
CAT inequality, the quanta emission rate can be expressed as ÔøΩùëÖùëÖÃá‚Ñé ùëìùëìùë£ùë£‚Ñé /ùëÅùëÅùêºùêºùêºùêº ÔøΩ and the CAT inequality could
easily be reformulated to express risk in terms of this quantity. However, the quanta emission rate
combines a host-dependent variable (the rate of viral shedding) with a susceptible dependent variable
(the infectious dose) and makes it difficult to delineate the effects of the distinct states (health, inspiratory
state, mask use, etc.) of the two individuals involved. Furthermore, the vast majority of such models

14

assume a ‚Äúwell-mixed‚Äù state for the aerosols in the environments and this does not allow for ‚Äúlocal‚Äù
effects90 that have direct bearing on practices such as social distancing.
Dose-response models of varying degree of complexity have been developed90. Many of these models
allow for spatial and temporal inhomogeneities in the aerosol concentrations and are well-suited for
detailed modeling of infection risk in a variety of scenarios. Some of the recent models that have been
developed can incorporate data on ambient flow conditions from computational models or experimental
measurements91. However, such models are expressed in mathematically complex forms, which
diminishes comprehensibility outside disciplinary expertise, and makes it particularly difficult to
communicate the underlying ideas to non-scientists. As shown in the previous sections, the simple
mathematical form of the current model and its phenomenology-based compartmentalization into host,
environment and susceptible dependent variables, not only allows for easier comprehension by a wide
range of audiences, but also provides quick estimates of factors including, but not limited to, the type of
mask worn, physical distancing, and the inspiratory status of the host and susceptible.
Finally, we point out the left-hand side of the CAT equality represent the total aerosol viral dose inhaled
ùëÅùëÅ
by the susceptible, and if we denote this variable by ùëÅùëÅùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ = ùëÖùëÖÃáùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°ùë° ùëáùëáùë†ùë† , then ÔøΩ ùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ùê∑ ‚àí 1ÔøΩ represents the
ùëÅùëÅùêºùêºùêºùêº

normalized viral ‚Äòoverdose‚Äô delivered to the susceptible. Thus, in addition to evaluating the risk of
transmission, the CAT inequality can also be used to assess the degree of exposure of the susceptible to
aerosolized virus, which is known to be correlated with the severity of the infection92.

10 Caveats
The notion that ‚Äúa model is a lie that helps us see the truth 2,‚Äù certainly applies to the current model as
well. The CAT inequality is an attempt to express the highly complex, multifactorial process of airborne
transmission of a respiratory infection such as COVID-19 in a simple way, and the following caveats and
limitations of this model are worth pointing out:
1. The choice of the variables in the CAT inequality is not unique and other combinations of the
variables are possible. In particular, the variables shown in the CAT inequality could be decomposed
further; for instance, ùëÖùëÖÃá‚Ñé can be expressed as the rate of droplet generation in the respiratory tract
and the fraction of generated droplets that are expelled from the mouth. Such a variable separation
might be appropriate, for instance, to isolate the effect of therapies that attempt to diminish the
droplet generation rate via alteration of the mucous properties35.
2. The inequality assumes that the rate of arrival of virion-bearing aerosols in the vicinity of the
susceptible is constant in time. The recent analysis83 of speech driven aerosol transport takes into
account the start time and travel duration in scenario (2) treated in section 8. The CAT inquality could
be modified to include a time-dependent emission and arrival rate21 but this would increase the
complexity of the mathematical expression. Assuming steady state condition results in predictions
that are more conservative in most cases. Finally, it is also assumed here that the rate of virion arrival
(i.e. proportional to the advective or diffusive flux of C) in the vicinity of the susceptible is sufficiently
high so that Cmax there is not markedly affected by the inhalation process itself. If the flux is not high
enough, the inhalation may deplete Cmax near the susceptible over time. The analysis for flux-limited
situations again introduces additional complexities.

3. The CAT inequality could be missing important, but as yet unknown effects. For instance, the use of
ùëÅùëÅùêºùêºùêºùêº in the model assumes that it is the accumulated dose of virus that determines transmission.
While this assumption is quite standard in the arena of infectious diseases21‚Äì23 it is plausible that the
rate at which this infectious dose is delivered to the respiratory tract of the susceptible is also
important in initiating an infection. For instance, 1000 virions inhaled over a short duration (say
minutes) might overwhelm the immune system whereas the same viral dose delivered over a much
longer duration (say hours) might allow the immune system to mount an effective response and
avoid infection.
4. The variables in the CAT inequality are more accurately represented as variables with probability
density functions (PDFs) given the stochastic nature of the processes involved93. For instance,
respiratory droplets of different sizes are expelled at different rates9,28,31,36 during an expiratory event
and the rate of droplet emission ùëÖùëÖÃá‚Ñé could therefore be expressed as a droplet size-dependent PDF.
Similarly, the viral loading of respiratory droplets (ùëìùëìùë£ùë£‚Ñé ) as well as the infectious dose ùëÅùëÅùêºùêºùêºùêº are
expected to be functions of droplet size, and could therefore be represented by droplet size
dependent PDFs. The often turbulent environment determining ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé is expected to cause significant
fluctuations in travel time, turbulent diffusion rates and individual eddying events can influence the
local concentrations. Hence, the factor ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé itself has a mean value as well as a distribution around
that mean value that depends on detailed flow conditions.
5. If the variables in the CAT inequality are interpreted as random variables with PDFs (as in 4. above),
it implicitly assumes the variables and factors are statistically independent. However, variables in the
CAT inequality are not necessarily mutually independent given the fact that many of them have
common dependencies. The joint dependency of many variables on particle size has already been
described above. Other examples include the face covering on the host which modifies ùëìùëìùëöùëö‚Ñé . A
resulting alteration of the expiratory jet due to the mask could also affect the aerosolization
variable ùëìùëìùëéùëé‚Ñé of the expelled droplets as well as entrainment into the ambient air current, which could
affect ùëìùëìùëéùëéùëéùëé .
6. The model assumes a single host but the CAT inequality can easily account for multiple hosts by
summing the left hand side for multiple infected hosts.
7. Validation of the proposed model is not attempted here. Validation requires accurate estimates of
inputs as well as outputs to the models, and these are difficult to obtain, especially for potentially
lethal infections such as COVID-19. Indeed, most models of airborne infection to date, including
classic24 as well as more recent models21,94‚Äì96, remain un-validated. Despite this lacuna of validation,
the value of all such models, including the current one, is that they enable an examination of how
transmission risk scales with key variables, and an assessment of the effects of mitigation strategies
on overall transmission rates.

11 Summary
The CAT Inequality is a mathematical model for estimating the risk of airborne transmission of infectious
diseases such as COVID-19, that is expressed in a simple and intuitive way so as to convey the factors
involved in transmission to a wide range of stakeholders ranging from scientists from various disciplines,
to policy makers, public media and even the general public. As shown through specific examples, the
model provides a framework for interpreting and quantifying the relative changes in risk from behaviors
such as, but not limited to, wearing masks, physical distancing, and the intensity of physical
activity/exercise on infection risk, in terms that are easy to convey to a range of audiences. The
approximately inverse relationship of transmission risk and spatial distance from physical distancing is one
example of the important insights that can be generated by the model.

In closing, we point out that while the transmission model presented here is inspired by the Drake
Equation, the current model is not speculative but of a more deterministic nature. This is because we
understand much more about the factors involved in this transmission model than we do about the factors
in the Drake equation. Indeed, as discussed in the paper, estimates for many of the variables in the CAT
inequality can be obtained from existing data or from basic principles of fluid dynamics, physiology, and
virology. Even for the variables for which we currently do not have good estimates, we understand the
underlying dependencies as well as the procedures/methods required to estimate these variables, and it
is expected that ongoing studies will close these gaps in our understanding, and provide better
quantification of all the variables involved in this model.

13 Appendix A ‚Äì Estimation of Upper and Lower Bounds for Average Filtration Efficiency
of Face Mask Fabrics
Upper Bound
Regression fit
True FE (unknown)

Lower Bound

Figure 9. Depiction of methodology for estimating lower and upper bound of the average FE over
the 50-5000 nm range from the data of Zangmeister et al.71. This particular example is for the 1 x
Cotton13, 2x Syn Blend 4 sample. The lower bound is obtained by assuming that the FE for PMDs
greater than 825 nm is equal to the FE measured at 825 nm. The upper bound is obtained by
employing a regression fit to the right side of the measured curve (beyond the PMD for minimum
FE) and extending it to the FE=100% line. Beyond this, the FE for the upper bound is assumed to
equal 100%.

The procedure for estimating the lower and upper bounds of the filtration efficiency (FE) for various
fabrics in Fig. 4 is described here. Zangmeister et al.71, measured the FE for various fabrics as a function of
17

particle mobility diameters (PMD) with diameters ranging from 50 to 825 nm. However, it is well
established that aerosol transmission occurs with aerosol particles with diameters up to at least 5 Œºm. In
order to apply the data from Zangmeister et al.71 in a way that is relevant for airborne transmission, the
FE versus PMD data has to be extended up to 5 Œºm. However, FE dependence on PMD is affected by the
filter diameter, the solidity (1-porosity), the density of the particles, and face velocity and simple
extrapolations of the FE versus PMD curves are not possible. Given this, and the fact that FE for any given
material approaches 100% at high enough PMD, we derive a lower and upper bound of the average FE
over the 50-5000 nm range as follows (see Fig. 9): the lower bound is obtained by assuming that the FE
for PMDs greater than 825 nm is equal to the measured FE at 825 nm. The upper bound is obtained by
employing a regression fit to the right side of the measured curve (beyond the PMD for minimum FE) and
extending it to the FE=100%. Beyond this, the FE for the upper bound is assumed to be equal to 100%. A
quadratic regression fit results in a R2 value exceeding 0.90 for all cases. For each bound, the average FE
(denoted by ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ
ùêπùêπùêπùêπ ) over the PMD range 50-5000 nm can now be estimated using numerical integration. Fig.
9 shows these bounds for one case cases and Table 1 shows the ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ
ùêπùêπùêπùêπ computed in this way for the various
fabrics considered in the current study. Finally, the table 1 provides a brief description of the various
fabrics/samples from Zangmeister et al.71 that are included in the current study, along with the estimated
lower and upper bounds of the average filtering efficiencies.

14 Appendix B ‚Äì Wall-Modeled Large Eddy Simulation of Breath Aerosols in Turbulent
Flows
Transport of periodically released breath puffs in a turbulent open channel is simulated by wall-modeled
large eddy simulation (LES). The computational domain is 60 m, 10 m and 20 m in the streamwise (x), wallnormal (y) and spanwise (z) directions respectively with 672 x 117 x 384 grid points. The point source
corresponding to the host is placed 1.5 m above from the ground, 10 m downstream of the inflow (defined
as x=0) and at the middle span. The Reynolds number based on the bulk velocity (2 m/s), the emission
height (1.5 m) and the viscosity of air, is 2.5 million. The grid has a uniform spacing of 5 cm for y‚â§3m and
-5m‚â§x‚â§10m, as well as in the z direction. It is stretched in the (x-y) plane for y>3m, x<-5m and x>10m
with a maximum stretching ratio of 4%.
The number of infectious respiratory aerosol and the temperature fluctuation around the ambient
temperature are modeled as two transported scalars fields. The droplet evolution is represented using
the Eulerian approach where instead of solving the Lagrangian evolution of individual drops, their
concentration is treated as a passive scalar. This approach can be far less expensive numerically and is
justified at the low volume fractions34 and negligible terminal velocities associated with the small
aerosolized droplets whose time-evolving concentration field, the simulations aim to represent. See Refs.
97‚Äì99 for prior developments and applications of the fast Eulerian two-fluid approach. The release of the
virus-laden puffs is implemented as a localized volume source term in the scalar transport equation.
Buoyancy due to temperature variations is modeled in the momentum equation by the Boussinesq
approximation as a function of the temperature. Subgrid-scale contributions for both the momentum are
modeled by the Lagrangian-averaged dynamic eddy-viscosity mode100,101. For the scalars, constant
subgrid-scale Schmidt and Prandtl numbers Sc=Pr=0.4 are used. Both the velocity and scalars are periodic
in the spanwise direction. In the streamwise direction, the flow is periodic, while the scalars have a
uniform Dirichlet boundary condition at the inflow and a convective condition at the outflow. A sponge
layer is applied near the outflow to force the scalars to be zero and let the flow recovers to a canonical
TBL. For both the velocity and scalar, an equilibrium rough wall model with zo = 0.5 mm is applied at the
18

bottom wall and zero vertical gradient condition at the top boundary. The value of the scalar at the wall
is the same as it in the incoming air at the inflow. The equations of motion and scalar transport are solved
using second-order accurate (in time and space) derivatives on a staggered mesh. The code is parallelized
using MPI and has been widely validated in similar types of turbulent flows87,102. Statistics are collected
over 30 minutes of physical flow time after the statistical steady state is reached. Increasing the number
of grid points by 26 percent in each direction (i.e., doubling the total number of grid points) has a negligible
effect on the flow statistics and the results presented in the main text.
