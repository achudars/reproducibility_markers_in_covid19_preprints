(Dated: June 2, 2020)
A quantitative COVID-19 model that incorporates hidden asymptomatic patients is developed,
and an analytic solution in parametric form is given. The model incorporates the impact of lockdown
and resulting spatial migration of population due to announcement of lockdown. A method is
presented for estimating the model parameters from real-world data. It is shown that increase of
infections slows down and herd immunity is achieved when symptomatic patients are 4-6% of the
population for the European countries we studied, when the total infected fraction is between 50-56
%. Finally, a method for estimating the number of asymptomatic patients, who have been the key
hidden link in the spread of the infections, is presented.

COVID-19 infections have breached the five million
mark, yet there is neither a vaccine nor a scalable treatment in sight [1, 2]. Furthermore, a distinctive feature
of the COVID-19, in contrast to other infectious diseases
such as Influenza or SARS, is the presence of a large
fraction of “asymptomatic” patients, who don’t have any
obvious symptoms but are still capable of infecting susceptible individuals through contacts. However, identifying individuals spreading infections via the asymptomatic
pathway is not easy unless extensive contact tracing and
testing are performed. A major challenge is the uncertainty in the estimation of asymptomatic fraction, with
estimates ranging from 41% to 86% of infected [3, 4]. And
along the symptomatic pathway, 44% of the infections are
spread before the onset of symptoms rendering the quarantining people with symptoms less efficient compared to
other infectious diseases.[5] These challenges have driven
governments to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing and partial or full
lockdowns [6]. An unsaid, a posteriori, rationale for these
lockdowns is that they provide efficient isolation mechanism for asymptomatic. However, a dearth of quantitative understanding of the effects of the lockdown has
triggered debate around the effectiveness, duration and
mode (partial vs. full) of lockdown. Thus, it is even suggested that societies should just move in an unhindered
manner, towards the attainment of the “herd-immunity
threshold” [7]. This threshold is achieved when a sufficiently large proportion of a population becomes immune, and as a result, the disease spread slows down.
For COVID-19, estimating the onset of herd immunity
remains elusive, and indeed, ascertaining whether herd
immunity exists at all! Moreover, high case fatality rate
of 3 − 10% (vs. 0.05% for seasonal influenza) limits the
practicality of herd immunity as an effective policy tool.

Thus, models that can provide quantitative estimates of
the disease spread and the impact of policy measures are
expeditiously required.
Similar to other epidemics/pandemic, three different
kinds of models are used for COVID-19: 1) Statistical
extrapolation models which fit the observed patterns of
infections to make short-term prediction [8, 9], 2) Agent
based models for a qualitative illustration of microscopic
dynamics of spreading infections [10], and 3) Compartment models which divide the population into groups
based on the current different disease state of the individual and model the interaction among them [2, 11–
13]. Since 1927 plague in Mumbai, compartmental models have been a standard guiding tool for policy decisions
[14]. The spread of flu-like diseases (influenza, SARS,
COVID-19 etc) is often modelled using three or four
compartments: Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) or
Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR). Some
variants, also consider theoretically a simple containment
option, of quarantining infected persons with symptoms.
However, all these models assume that only contact between the S and the I compartments leads to new infections, with the implicit assumption that contact between
the S and E compartments does not lead to any infection. In contrast, an asymptomatic patient with COVID19 can, and does, infect susceptible individuals through
contact. Thus, epidemiological models must consider
the distinction between asymptomatic and symptomatic.
Moreover, models should distinguish between lockdown
and quarantine as these are two qualitatively different
policy tools the former operating at the level of a society
and the latter the level of a few individuals.
In this letter, we aim to model all these novel aspects
of COVID-19 and to accomplish three goals:
1. Formulate a minimal epidemiological model in-

2
corporating above mentioned unique aspects of
COVID-19 disease spread and associated policies.

parallel pathways of infection (Figure 1B).

2. Establish that the model representatively captures
the observed epidemiological data, and sheds light
on the underlying parameters and universalities
that govern the dynamics in the different phases
of the pandemic spread and containment.
3. Use the model to address pertinent questions beyond what is readily measurable – estimates of
the hidden asymptomatics or at what fraction of
symptomatic infections herd immunity would be
achieved.
We accomplish these objectives by introducing the
SAIR model which treats infections by an asymptomatic
(A) or an infected symptomatic person (I) as being
equally likely. The dynamical behavior of this model is
quite different from that of the SEIR model. The model
takes into account lockdown in an explicit fashion by using discontinuous in time reproduction rate (the effective
rate at which susceptible population get converted into
infected). We give an implicit closed-form solution for
this SAIR model, which sheds light on the dynamics of
the SAIR model, and also leads to methods for estimating the parameters therein. In order to make this parametric form readily computable, we also introduce an
approximate explicit representation. Then we provide a
method for estimating the parameters in the model based
on the evolution of the disease, and extract the underlying country-specific parameters from the infection data.
Further, we show that there exists an intermediate regime
immediately after the lockdown that is country-specific,
and that the country specific metrics of the success of
lockdown can be extracted and analyzed. Then we show
that the herd immunity for COVID-19 is achieved when
the total symptomatic infections are only around 5−10%
of the population, which is lower than estimated.
We begin by emphasizing the difference between SEIR
and SAIR models [11]. A typical SEIR model assumes a
framework of serial, directed transitions across the intermediate health states of the individuals (FIG.1). In this
framework, the infections are caused when a susceptible
person comes in contact with a person deemed to be infected person on the basis of the symptoms (I). However,
after this contact, with a certain likelihood the person remains in a pre-symptomatic intermediate state or the exposed individual (E), that is not contagious, before transitioning to a contagious and symptomic state (I). While
this framework is acceptable for influenza or SARS, the
epidemiology of COVID-19 is such that there is an alternative pathway between the susceptible (S) and the
recovered states (R) which passes through asymptomatic
individuals (estimated to be around 86%),[3] who never
show any symptoms but carry enough viral load to infect
others. Thus a model for COVID-19 should consider two

FIG. 1. Schematic of SEIR and SAIR models

We consider a generalized version of SAIR model as
representation of a homogenously mixed population segment where COVID-19 is spreading. The system will
obey the following SAIR dynamics
Ṡ = −α(t) S (I + A) ,

Ȧ = α(t) S (I + A) − δ A − γA + β(t)A,
I˙ = δ A − γI,

(1)

Ṙ = γ (I + A).

where for any variable X time derivative is denoted as
Ẋ = dX/dt. We assume that α(t) denotes the probability with which, when a susceptible person meets an
infected or asymptomatic person, they become a part
of the asymptomatics, which for simplicity includes the
pre-symptomatics and the asymptomatics. In our formulation of the model, we claim that the lockdown
can be modeled by considering a sudden change in the
infection rate constant using a Heavyside function as
α(t) = α0 H(tlock − t). Here, we note in passing that one
can model social distancing as reduction in value of α or
an imperfect lockdown. In a minimal model, one may
assume that asymptomatic patients either get converted
into symptomatic one with an effective rate δ or recovers
with a rate γ. This term, typically absent in standard
models, denotes the fact that in an idealized lock-down
no susceptible person meets an infected person and thus
first order reaction changes to a zero-order reaction.
Before we proceed to analyse the model, we wish to
point out that one may add further complication to this
model by introducing more parameters and compartments. For example, recovery rate γ and infection rate
α need not be same for asymptomatic and symptomatic
fraction [11]. However, as there is no biological evidence
to the contrary, we assume that both rates are equal,
which leads to an analytically tractable and simplified
framework.

3
However, in reality for a large country it is unrealistic
to consider it as a homogenously mixed population. Further, during this crisis we learnt that once a lockdown is
announced, people migrate across different segments of a
country. Even for a qualitatively correct modeling of disease spread dynamics, it is important to account for this
migration of people. This migration can indeed happen
in many waves. However, for simplicity we assume that
it happens once and only during a short duration after
lockdown. Furthermore, one would expect that among
infected population only asymptomatic people are able
to travel. Here, it needs to be reminded that, we are
only interested in the influx of the infected population in
a given population segment, and not the details of where
they came from. In order to model such a scenario, we
take typical thermodynamic route of dividing the system
into two parts: system and universe. Finally, the coupling constant β(t) = β1 {H(tlock +  − t) − H(tlock − t)}
and  is the short period of time post lock-down, in which
population migration is allowed/possible. This migration
is a characteristic of the system (country or region under
consideration) and parameters β and  need to be extracted from the data. The rest of the world can also be
assumed for this purpose to be following a similar SAIR
dynamics
ṠU = −α(t)SU (IU + AU ) ,

ȦU = α(t)SU (IU + AU ) − δ AU − γAU − βA,
I˙U = δAU − γIU ,

Eq.(1) and (2) complete our development of COVID-19
specific model. In the present work, we solved a phenomenological model of a well-mixed society, with everyone interacting with everyone else. However, the interactions may be structured by age, local movement of the
population, and many of these can be modelled in the
framework of agent based models. The formulation of
the disease specific interactions we developed can also be
integrated into other models which study the interactions
at agent level detail, or in tandem with economic consequences [15], both of which are beyond the scope of the
present work. With an emphasis mainly on the spread
of infections at the societal level, we show that the set of
equations we model are sufficient to capture most of the
available epidemiological data on COVID-19.
This system of equations can be solved for prelockdown situation in terms of the reproduction rate
r0 = α0 /γ by defining M = I + A, and observing that
before lockdown, we have

which can be solved in terms of S̃ = S/S0 as
R = −r0−1 log S̃,

M = 1 − S + r0−1 log S̃

M = exp(−γt) [Ilock + Alock (1 + δ) exp((β1 − δ)t)] (5)
Once there is no more flux of asymptomatic individuals,
the equations for M yield an exponential decay given by
R = 1 − M − Slock (6)

M = Mlock+ exp(−γt),

Substituting the expression from Eq.(4) in the evolution
equation for S gives us the parametric solution in implicit
form as

(7)
α0 t =

1 s −1 + S0 s − r0 log s
Assuming that the equation can be converted to an explicit form for S̃ as a function of t, it is possible to substitute this into Eq.(4) to obtain an expression for M as
a function of t. Finally, the expression for M (t) can be
disambiguated into separate expressions for I(t) and A(t)

by using Eq.(1). Specifically, in the equation for I,
can substitute A = M − I, which gives
I˙ = − (δ + γ) I(t) + δM (t).

where M + S + R = 1 at any instant, S0 denotes the
susceptible population at t = 0 and the recovered population at t = 0 is taken to be 0.
On the other hand, after an idealized lock-down no susceptible person meets an infected person and thus the
first order reaction changes to a zero order reaction. The
intermediate time (tlock < t < tlock +) solution simplifies
to

If we define a new constant δ1 = γ + δ, then the solution
of the above equation is

Therefore the key is to turn Eq.(7) into an explicit expression, to the extent possible. For this purpose, we use
Hermite-Hadamard inequality for the logarithm [16]
z−1
≤ log z ≤ z − 1
z

(9)

which suggests that we use approximate form of the logarithm as log z = (z − 1)(w1 /z + w2 ), with the constraint
that w1 + w2 = 1. Upon approximating the logarithm,
we get a solution in explicit form as
S̃ =

h(1 + h2 exp(h α0 t))
b
+
2a (1 − h2 exp(h α0 t)) 2a

(10)

where a = (S0 r0 − w2 )/r0 , b = (r0 + w1 − w2 ) /r0 , d =
w1 /r0 . where h2 = (2 a − b − √
h)/(2 a − b + h), and h is
a constant such that and h = b2 − 4ad. Once the evolution equation for S is known in a closed from, we find
the evolution for the remaining variables using Eq. (4).

FIG 3 depicts a representative temporal variation for the
parameters S,A, I and R captured using the analytical
solution. The analytical solution formulated using the
above approximation to logarithm is found to be in close
agreement with the numerical solution of the ODE (see
Supplemental Material [17]).

be managed at most with contact tracing and quarantine, and hence addressing a solution for the lockdown
did not arise. COVID-19 thus presented itself with the
unique infection scenarios and the challenges of the lockdown for its mitigation, and our model and its closed
form-solution address these uniquene aspects.
The reported infection data from different countries
had three regimes - rising, intermediate and decreasing,
if they implemented a lockdown. It can be easily assumed that the reported infections are the symptomatic
infections, since most countries have been short of testing
resources; as a result, patients were tested for a confirmation only after the onset of symptoms. The equations derived above for I could be fit will all these three different
regimes. In the process, we could extract the governing
parameters. The parameter α0 , γ and δ1 are estimated
by fitting Eq. (11), Eq.(6) and Eq.(12) respectively, to
the publicly available data pertaining to the pre and post
lock-down period for various countries (see Supplemental Material [17]). The parameters α0 representing the
rise is similar for many countries reiterating a universal pattern in the initial pre-lockdown regime. This can
be understood as an intrinsic characteristic dynamics of
COVID-19 which exhibits strong similarities across countries (see Table 1 in Supplemental Material [17]). But a
much stronger country-specific disease dynamics was the
intermediate regime, described using the parameter β1 .
The formal solution in (Eq. 12) is fit to the infection
rate right after lock-down to estimate the parameter β1
and α (see Supplementary FIGS.3,4). This is to be expected as migration during lockdown can be expected
to be a country-specific event dictated by the prevalent
social-political conditions.

The evolution of infections pre-lockdown and in early
time limit is given by

where,

Eqs. (11), Eq.(6) and Eq.(12) are the closed-form solutions to the model we developed. Epidemics like SARS in
2003, Swine flu in 2009, MERS in 2012 and 2015, could

range of real time parameter values for COVID19 (see Supplemental Material). The blue and the red lines indicate the
maxima, considering only the symptomatic or the total infections respectively. The infection rate slows down significantly
and a herd-immunity is achieved after the combined infections
reach a peak when the symptomatic infections have crossed
≈ 5.7% of the total population. The peak of the symptomatic
infections is achieved at around 16%, just before the final saturation value of around 20%.

5
With these validations for the levels of infections I
that were observed in the different countries, and the parameters that were extracted, we could estimate how the
number of individuals in the individual compartments S,
A, I and R changed with time with or without a lockdown (FIG.3). Because it had been impossible to test
the entire population or even a significant fraction of it,
the asymptomatics have remained a missing link in the
epidemiology, although certain estimates suggest a 1:10
ratio between the sympomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Using our model, we could estimate the ratio of
the asymptomatic to symptomatic individuals (Supplementary Fig. 5), which varies from 1 to 40 depending on
the phase of the pandemic dynamics. Our results show
that the herd-immunity, defined as the fraction of population at which symptomatic infections reach a peak
and beyond which begin decreasing could be achieved
at 4-6% of the population as illustrated in FIG.3) (TABLE 2 in Supplementary Information).These estimates
for herd-immunity which are in single digit percentages
only seem contradictory to estimates of 50-60% [18] until one realises the large fraction of the infections are
asymptomatic accounting for a total infection of 50-56%
of the population (Supplementary Table 2). Thus our
model allowed us to make estimates both for the hiddenasymptomatics and the herd-immunity, and the fraction
of the symptomatics who will burden the health care system.
In conclusion, as a part of our analysis, we are able
to provide a method for estimating the asymptomatic
fraction of the population. Finally, by fitting our model
to data from countries where the pandemic appears to
have peaked, we are also able to estimate the level of
herd-immunity. We are able to show that herd-immunity
is achieved at levels of just 5% to 10%, far lower than
the levels suggested in the literature. We find that the
SAIR model can be readily adapted to incorporate the
effects of lockdown and the solution to the system of
equations bears striking resemblance to the real-world
data. The formal solution allows one to evaluate the
effect of lockdown as a policy tool and can also be integrated into other frameworks which study the economic
consequences of the lockdowns.

II. PARAMETER ESTIMATION

In this section we discuss the estimation procedure for the parameters (α0 , γ, δ). The analytical solutions for the
infected(active) and recovered populations is known for both pre(discussed in section I) and post lock-down scenarios.

FIG. 2: The figure illustrates the ability of the analytical solution found in section I, to correctly capture the dynamics of the
SAIR model. The parameters used for these plots are, α = 0.25, γ = 0.027, δ1 = 0.036, which are in reasonable range of real
time parameter values for COVID19 (discussed in section II). The initial conditions is one infected person in a million people.

These analytical solutions are then fit onto the real time data for several countries, to give us an estimate of the
parameters relevant to COVID19. We begin with the post lock-down scenarios as the solutions are rather straight
forward. After a ’’ number of days post lockdown, the recovery rate is given by
