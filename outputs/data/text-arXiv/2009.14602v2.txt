Abstract
An integrated approach of spatial data analysis and Geographically Weighted Poisson
Regression (GWPR) along with global regression techniques are used in this study. This
approach aims to model relationships between dependent variable Covid-19 and independent
variables from socioeconomic and pre-existing health conditions within the local government
area (LGA) in New South Wales (NSW)-Australia. Based on geospatial data analysis and a
step-by-step procedure in building both global and GWPR models, four (4) independent
variables are finally selected to investigate relationships between dependent and independent
variables at the local scale. The GWPR model's results with the Goodness-of-Fit (R2) range
between 45-73% exhibit positive relationships between Covid-19 and the total population, the
cancers, and the people with ages between 60 and 85 in most of the NSW state. Meanwhile, a
negative relationship is observed between Covid-19 and the ischaemic heart disease;
however, the estimated coefficients for this relationship are very low and close to zero; hence
further investigation, including assessment from a different perspective, is necessary for
validation. In conclusion, the model suggests that the relationships between the dependent
variable and independent variables are nonstationary. Therefore, GWPR model calibration
plays a vital role in geographic modelling at the local scale.

1. Introduction
Covid-19 is "an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus" (WHO, 2020),
which was first reported from China on December 31st, 2019 (WHO, 2020). Since then, the
pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world and resulted in a total of 8,525,042 active
cases and 456,973 deaths by June 20th, 2020. The total infected cases include 3,144 positive
cases and 48 deaths reported from New South Wales, Australia (Department of Health,
Australian Government, 2020). Furthermore, WHO (2020) declared that older people,
including those with pre-medical health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
chronic respiratory disease, and cancer, are more likely to be infected with severe illness.
In this study, the author statistically analyses the spatial data, namely independent variables,
and geographically models the Covid-19, namely dependent variable, to investigate the
relationship between the dependent and independent variables by the local government area
(LGA) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The global regression and the Geographically
Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) approaches are used to model the relationship
globally and geographically between Covid-19 and socioeconomic variables as well as the
pre-existing medical health problems, particularly those susceptible to coronavirus as
declared WHO (2020).
2. Spatial data and Methodology
2.1 Study Area and Spatial Data
The study area, New South Wales (NSW) is geographically located on the east coast of the
Australian continent with a total area of 809,444 km2. NSW state shares onshore boundaries
with nearby states, Queensland in the north, South Australia in the West, and Victoria in the
south. Meanwhile, its eastern edge directly facing the Tasman Sea of the Pacific Ocean. The
NSW state's location is illustrated in figure 1, along with the total Covid-19 cases in each
LGA between January 25th, 2020 and April 24th, 2020.

Dataset used in this study primarily consists of two main groups, the socioeconomic data and
the health records in New South Wales between 2016 and 2017, which were obtained from
Data.NSW, Public Health Information Development Unit (PHIDU), and Australian Bureau of
Statistics. The dependent variable, the total cases of Covid-19 in New South Wales, were
obtained
from
Data.NSW
(https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/covid-19-cases-bylocation/resource/21304414-1ff1-4243-a5d2-f52778048b29). The Covid-19 data is available
on a day-to-day basis for each LGA between January 25th and April 24th, 2020. This data is
then re-arranged into total Covid-19 cases for each 130 LGA in the New South Wales state.
Meanwhile, the socioeconomic data was primarily obtained from the Australian Bureau of
Statistics
(https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3105.0.65.0012016?OpenDocu
ment), and partially obtained from PHIDU (http://phidu.torrens.edu.au/social-healthatlases/data) along with the data for pre-existing medical health problems. A list of the
dataset used in this study is provided in Annex 1.
2.2 Global Regression Linear for global/aspatial model
Global regression linear is a standard stationary regression linear for an aspatial model
(Fotheringham et al., 2013). The relationship between the dependent and independent
variables is expressed by a constant mean value across the study area regardless of variability
over space. A standard formula for the global regression calibration is expressed as follows:
Yi = β0 + β1Xi1 + β2Xi2 + … βnXin

(Equation 1)

Where Yi is the dependent variable (in this case total Covid-19 cases) observed at location i,
Xi represents independent variables measured at location i, and β represents coefficient
parameters that describe how a change in X (independent variable) affects Y (dependent
variable).
In relation to geographically weighted regression linear discussed in the later stage, the global
model and its resulting parameters are important as a benchmark model to be compared to its
counterpart GWPR local model (Fotheringham et al., 2003). In terms of operation of the
GWR4 software, the global model is generated simultaneously with the GWPR model.
2.3 Geographically Weighted Regression Linear for GWPR model
Unlike the global model, the geographically weighted regression linear is a nonstationary
regression linear with an additional function of spatial location (Fotheringham et al., 2003),
where the estimated coefficient parameters are varied over space. A formula for the GWPR
regression is expressed with variability over space as follows:
Yi = β0(i) + β1(i) Xi1 + β2(i) Xi2 + … βn(i) Xin

(Equation 2)

where index i is added to the standard global regression calibration formula in equation 1 to
express the variability over space locally.
In this study, a step-by-step procedure in building the GWPR model is adopted from
Fotheringham et al. (2003), Vanessa da Silva (2015), Tenerelli et al. (2016), and Mansley et
al. (2015); and provided in the following 6 (six) stages in order.

2.3.1 Stage 1: Variable selection
The GWPR modelling is initiated by variable selection in order to appropriately select the
independent variables based on the literature review, the recommendation from experts, and
the common knowledge with consideration to the dependent variable. In this section, a total
of 30 independent variables are selected from 50 variables from the dataset provided in annex
1. The independent variables selected consist of 5 variables from the socioeconomic group
and 25 variables from the health group.
2.3.2 Stage 2: Multicollinearity check
Multicollinearity between variables is assessed using "Spearman's correlation rank" with the
threshold correlation of 0.7 (Tenerelli et al., 2016). This process is aimed to filter out
variables with the multicollinearity effect due to the high degree of correlation between
variables. At this stage, variables with a correlation beyond 0.7 are excluded except those
considered susceptive to coronavirus infection, such as older people, cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancers, as indicated by WHO (2020). Therefore, a
total of 18 variables were further rejected and living 12 variables to proceed to the next stage,
which consists of 3 socioeconomic variables and 9 health variables. The multicollinearity
check’s result is presented as a correlation matrix between independent variables as provided
in annex 2.
2.3.3 Stage 3: Model optimization with a stepwise-AICc procedure
Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) is a measurement of statistical model's quality from a
dataset (Konishi et al., 2008). The quality optimization of the final model can be achieved by
comparing AICc values of multiple models calibrated from the dataset; the lower the AICc,
the better the model quality (Fotheringham et al., 2003). The stepwise-AICc procedure is
initiated by sequentially run ordinary least square (OLS) for each variable from the dataset,
the OLS round one. The variable with the best fitting model, which is the smallest AICc
value, is selected and added permanently to the model before proceeding to the next rounds.
This procedure is repeated until the smallest AICc value is obtained for all the independent
variables from each round. The next step is to plot the smallest AICc values of each
independent variable in the scatter plot and assess the quality optimization of the model from
the curve. The variable with the highest AICc value from OLS round one declines towards
the curve's lowest point before reaching its constant point or inclining point. The variables
with AICc constant or inclining after the lowest point considered no improvement to the final
model. This procedure can be simply run in RStudio programming software with appropriate
programming code for statistical computation following the aforementioned procedure.
At this stage, a total of 12 variables from stage 2 are further assessed with the stepwise AICc
procedure. It reveals that the last 5 variables no longer improve the model, and therefore they
are excluded from the final model. Variables excluded are Mood-Disord, Obst_Pulmonary,
SQKM, Diabetes and Stroke; hence leaving the 7 variables: TotPop, Rest_syst, Cancers, 6085yr, Kidney, Ischaemic_heart and Asthma. The result of the stepwise AICc procedure can
be seen in figure 2.

Diabetes, and Stroke are excluded)

2.3.4 Stage 4: Spatial variability test
The spatial variability of an individual variable can be tested by comparing the original GWR
model and the switched model, the comparison indicators (Nakaya, 2016). In GWR4
software, the spatial variability is given by "Diff of Criterion," which indicates the
comparison coefficient between the original model and the switched model. The variables
with a positive "Diff of Criterion" value indicate no local spatial variability, while negative
values indicate local spatial variability (Nakaya, 2016); hence, decisions can be made in
terms of local and global variables. At this stage, the spatial variability test's results indicate
that variables Resp_syst, Kidney, and Asthma are observed to have very low/no local spatial
variability as given by the positive "Diff of Criterion" coefficient. Therefore, these variables
are only assigned to the global model and excluded from the local model calibration. The
result of the spatial variability test is provided in table 1.

2.3.5 Stage 5: Model Calibration
The model calibration for both global and GWPR are run simultaneously in GWR4 software
with a 5 (five) steps procedure (Nakaya, 2016). Step 1 is project settings and data input,
including the final review of the dataset before proceeding to model calibration. Step 2 is the
most critical part of the model calibration, where variables are assigned as dependent or
independent variables as well as local or global, settings for model type, and define the
geographical location of the variables. In this study, variables TotPop, Cancers, 60-85yr, and
Ischaemic_Health are selected for both global and local regression, while the other three
variables are limited to global regression with consideration to procedure discussed in stages
1 - 4; and the Poisson model type is selected for the count data. Step 3 defines the Kernel
function for geographical weighting to estimate local coefficients, bandwidth size, and model
selection criteria necessary for finding the best bandwidth. In this study, the adaptive bisquare Kernel type is selected with the bandwidth selection method of golden section search
and AICc selection criteria. Steps 4 and 5 are settings for output files and further executing
and run calibration for the final model.
2.3.6 Stage 6: Mapping, analysis, and interpretation
Global and local models obtained from GWR4 are further mapped and analysed in the ArcGIS software, including minor calculations in Microsoft excel. This process includes analysis
and interpretation of the individual model as well as model comparison. Details of mapping,
analysis, and interpretation are described in sections 3 and 4.
In order to analyse the spatial autocorrelation, the standard residuals for global and local
models are calculated and mapped. The standard residuals for both global and local models
are calculated with reference to estimated coefficients and statistical parameters generated
from the final model. The global regression coefficients are provided in table 2, while local
regression coefficients are indicated by ‘yhat’. Calculations of standard residuals for each
model are provided in the following equations 3 to 6, respectively.
Global Residual = [TotCov19] - (2.067951 + 0.000016 * [TotPop] + 0.000369 * [Cancers] 0.000013 * [age] - 0.000639 * [heart])
(equation 3)
Standard Global Residual = ([Glob_Res] - 19.134585) / 35.306436

(equation 4)

where 19.134585 and 35.306436 are mean and standard deviation values of the global
residual
LocRes = [y_1] - [yhat]

(equation 5)

StLocRes = ([Loc_Res] + 0.619157) / 19.353506

(equation 6)

where -0.619157 and 19.353506 are mean and standard deviation values of the global
residual.

3.2 Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression Linear for GWPR model
With reference to section 2.3.4 and the previous sections, only 4 variables are finally
accepted for GWPR calibration. The Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression Linear
(GWPR) model with an Adaptive bi-square Kernel resulted in an optimal bandwidth of 60
nearest neighbours. It means that a local model for each 130 local government area (LGA)
was generated using weighted data from the nearest 60 LGA, which is 46 percent of the total
LGA.
Local coefficients of the 4 variables for the entire NSW state are statistically presented in
table 4 along with the AICc and R2. For the purpose of interpretation, the estimated
7|Page

coefficients of individual variables and their significance (t-value) are mapped and presented
in figures 3 – 8, including R2 and standardized residuals maps. The GWPR model's result
indicates Goodness-of-Fit (R2) of 78% with an AICc value of 1264. Detailed discussion and
interpretation of each map are presented in section 4.

4. Discussion
The GWPR model exhibits an improvement of model quality locally, where the AICc
decreases from 2060 in the global model to 1264 in GWPR, and the Goodness-of-Fit (R2)
increases from 64% in the global model to 78% in GWPR.
Figures 3 – 6 show maps of the local parameter estimated (left maps), and the statistically
significant to P<0.05 (right maps), which means the t-value between -1.96 and +1.96 are
statistically not significant. The colour code for the local parameter (left maps) indicates the
estimated risk level for Covid-19 infection, where the high risk is represented by red and
decreases towards green. Meanwhile, the colour code for the t-value (right maps) indicates
that only red and green colours are statistically significant and valid for this study.
Figure 3 illustrates the positive relationship between the variable total population and Covid19 in the eastern side of NSW (red and orange in the left map), where the t-value is
statistically significant (red in the right map). Similarly, figure 4 illustrates a positive
relationship between variable cancers and Covid-19 in the eastern side of NSW (red, orange,
yellow, and green in the left map), where the t-value is statistically significant (red in the
right map). Both global and GWPR models suggest a positive relationship between these 2
variables and Covid-19.
Interestingly, the global model suggests a negative relationship between variables people with
ages between 60 and 85 years and Covid-19. In contrast, the GWPR model presented in
figure 5 reveals a positive relationship between these variables in most of the NSW area (red,
orange, yellow, and light green in the left map), except the very eastern side of the NSW area
with a negative relationship (green). The t-value is statistically significant in most of the
study area, as indicated by green and red colours in the right map).
In contrast, the global model, as well as the GWPR model presented in figure 6, suggest a
negative relationship between the variables ischaemic heart disease and Covid-19 in the
eastern side of NSW (red, orange, light green, and green in the left map). The t-value for this
relationship is statistically significant, as indicated by the green colour in the right map. The
negative relationships between these variables observed from both global and local models
10 | P a g e

Francelino A. Xavier-Conceição

are contradicted to the initial hypotheses by the WHO (2020). However, the estimated
coefficients for this relationship are very small and close to zero; hence further observations
including assessment from different perspectives are required for validation.
Figure 7 exhibits that the local model replicates variations in variable total Covid-19 very
well in the eastern side of NSW with a Goodness-of-Fit (R2) range between 52-73% but less
fit in western NSW. Nevertheless, the R2 in western NSW is not significantly poor and
maintains its consistency between 45-52%; hence it can be accepted.
The standardized residuals for the global and local models (figure 8) indicate that the global
model is spatially autocorrelated compared to the local model. The standardized residual of
the local model (right map) suggests nonstationary relationships between the dependent
variable total Covid-19 and the independent variables. Therefore, it proves the GWPR
calibration's effectiveness to account for the geographical variability in this study.
5. Conclusions
The global regression and the Geographical Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) models
are used in this study to assess the relationship between total Covid-19 and variables from
socioeconomic and health sectors in local government area (LGA) in New South Wales
(NSW). Through step-by-step procedure in building the global and GWPR model, 50
independent variables are filtered, and leaving 4 variables for the GWPR model calibration.
The GWPR results exhibit that the independent variables total population, cancers, and
people with ages between 60 and 85 years are positively correlated with dependent variable
total Covid-19. Meanwhile, the independent variable ischaemic heart disease is negatively
correlated with the dependent variable Covid-19, where the model coefficient is very small
and close to zero; therefore, further assessment is required for validation.
The GWPR calibration successfully improved the model quality by 14%, and the AICc value
decreased from 2060 in the global model to 1264 in GWPR. The Goodness-of-Fit (R2) map
indicates that the model performed well with R2 varying from 45-73%. Furthermore, the
standardized residual of the GWPR model exhibits nonstationary relationships between the
dependent variable and independent variables compared to the global model. Therefore,
GWPR calibration plays a vital role in geographic modelling at the local scale.
