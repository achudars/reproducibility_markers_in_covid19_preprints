Abstract
Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) in the late 2019, it has affected over 200 countries and billions of people worldwide. This has affected the social
life of people owing to enforcements, such
as “social distancing” and “stay at home.”
This has resulted in an increasing interaction
through social media. Given that social media can bring us valuable information about
COVID-19 at a global scale, it is important
to share the data and encourage social media
studies against COVID-19 or other infectious
diseases. Therefore, we have released a multilingual dataset of social media posts related
to COVID-19, consisting of microblogs in English and Japanese from Twitter and those in
Chinese from Weibo. The data cover microblogs from January 20, 2020, to March 24,
2020. This paper also provides a quantitative
as well as qualitative analysis of these datasets
by creating daily word clouds as an example of
text-mining analysis. The dataset is now available on Github.1 This dataset can be analyzed
in a multitude of ways and is expected to help
in efficient communication of precautions related to COVID-19.

Introduction

The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) was observed at the end of 2019 in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Since January
2020, it has rapidly spread worldwide. On March
11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
announced that COVID-19 can be characterized
as a pandemic. The virus causing COVID-19,
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 1.2 million people worldwide, and 60,000 people have
lost their lives.2 WHO highly recommends main1

taining “social distancing” measures, and several
countries with severe epidemics are further requesting citizens to stay home.
In this scenario, online social media, such as
Twitter, Weibo, and Instagram, are playing an important role in sharing information and perception about COVID-19. Social media is recognized
as one of the valuable resource of data that can
lead to prediction of various phenomena related
to an event. For example, Lampos and Cristianini (2010) showed that microblog data facilitated
better public-health surveillance, such as the prediction of the number of patients suffering from
influenza.
To encourage and support the social media studies on COVID-19, it is crucial to make relevant
datasets available to the public. Here, we publish
a multilingual dataset that contains over 20 million microblogs related to COVID-19 in English,
Japanese, and Chinese from Twitter and Weibo
since January 20, 2020, until March 24, 2020.
Chen et al. (2020) and Lopez et al. (2020)
have already released multilingual datasets collected from Twitter. Given that China is the very
first country to have faced a COVID-19 outbreak,
we further collected microblogs about COVID-19
from Weibo, one of the most popular social media
in China similar to Twitter.
The remainder of the paper is organized as described follows. In Section 2, we elaborate on the
method of data collection. In Section 3, we provide a quantitative analysis of the dataset, such
as the character count per microblog and the microblog count per day. In Section 4, we present the
daily word cloud images created from microblogs
of each language as an example of text-mining
analysis. Finally, in Section 5, we present the conclusion with our future work.

Data Collection

To collect the microblogs related to COVID-19,
we adopted keyword-based search. For English
and Japanese, we collected microblogs related to
COVID-19 from Twitter, while we obtained Chinese microblogs from Weibo. We employed Twitter Search API3 for tweets; a web crawler was applied to retrieve Weibo posts.
2.1

English
Japanese
Chinese

Phase 1 (January 20 to February 23, 2020):
In combination with the term “Wuhan,” we
used the keywords “pneumonia” and “coronavirus” in English and their translations in
Japanese and Chinese. We included the Chinese city name “Wuhan” as the primary keyword, because Wuhan (“武 漢” in Japanese
and “武汉” in Chinese) observed the earliest
outbreak with the maximum number of confirmed cases. Note that in the said period, the
official disease name “COVID-19” was yet to
be defined.
Phase 2 (February 24 to 29, 2020):
WHO assigned the official name “COVID19” on February 11. We added it to the
keywords in combination with “Wuhan,” although this resulted in a smaller number of
retrieval because all the microblogs included
“Wuhan.”
Phase 3 (March 1–24, 2020):
To obtain more data, we relaxed search con3

ditions by querying each set of keywords separately.

Keywords

We developed three sets of query keywords as
shown in Table 1 according to the stages of
COVID-19 spread. Corresponding to these sets,
our dataset can be divided into three phases:

Phase 1

2.2

Data Size

As shown in Table 2, we have collected over
16 million microblogs in English, 9 million in
Japanese, and 180 thousand in Chinese during January 20 to March 24, 2020. To collect Twitter and
Weibo posts, we have adopted a uniform daily timing to collect microblogs from 0:00 to 23:59 (JST)
of the previous day. To ensure the uniqueness of
the data, for Twitter, we filtered out all retweets by
adding the “-filter:retweets” operator; for Weibo,
we searched for “original microblogs” only. Note
that we have collected smaller amounts of the data
from Weibo than Twitter because anti-crawling
mechanism in Weibo limits our web crawler to access only the first 50 pages of the search content.
2.3

Dataset Accessibility

We released the first version of the dataset on
Github at https://github.com/sociocom/covi
d19_dataset. Following the terms of service
of Twitter and Weibo, we mainly published microblog IDs, instead of exposing original text and
metadata. The dataset consists of the lists of microblog IDs with two fields of metadata: their
timestamps and the query keywords mentioned in
the microblogs among our search queries. This
helps make subsets suitable for subsequent applications and tasks. Since a Weibo’s microblog is

uniquely determined by the combination of user
ID and microblog ID, we share the corresponding
user ID and microblog ID for each microblog in
the form of “user ID/microblog ID.”

Quantitative Analysis

We provide basic statistics of our dataset in terms
of its quantitative volume. First, we show the number of characters in microblogs. Next, we plot the
number of microblogs per time series.
3.1

Character Count

While microblogs contain multimodal data (e.g.,
images and movies), their core content is text. We
report the number of characters to quantify the total amount of our dataset. Table 3 shows the sum,
mean, and standard deviation of the number of
characters for each language in our dataset. We
removed URLs and punctuations from each microblog to expose the amount of characters that
constituted the essential content.
3.2

Daily Microblog Count

Figure 1 portrays the daily count of microblogs
in each language, combined with the number of
confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients every day,
which is obtained from DataHub.io4 . Figure 1(a)
is the plot of English microblogs and the confirmed cases in four major English-speaking countries (i.e., Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom,
and the United States) during Phases 1 and 2;
Figure 1(b) shows that in Phase 3. Figures 1(c)
and 1(e) are the Japanese and Chinese versions of
the same plots for Phases 1 and 2, whereas Figures 1(d) and 1(f) display the plots of Phase 3.
In Figure 1(a), a sudden and dramatic increase
in the number of English microblogs can be observed on January 28, 2020. According to the
news, that particular day saw a discussion on the
death toll in mainland China reaching 100.5 On
the same day, Japan also observed a sharp rise in
4

the relevant microblogs, as shown in Figure 1(c).
This was a result of many users tweeting extensively about the three newly confirmed cases in
Japan, which included people who had not been
to Wuhan.6
Subsequently, there was a substantial increase
in the English microblogs on February 25, 2020,
as shown in Figure 1(a). On that day, there were
reports that “Trump privately vents over his team’s
response to coronavirus – even though he says that
the virus is under control,”7 leading to many microblogs against Trump on Twitter.
In March, as Figure 1(b) shows, the number of
microblogs in major English-speaking countries
showed an upward trend as the number of the confirmed cases increased, and the largest number of
microblogs exceeded 9 million a day. Meanwhile,
in Japan, the number of daily confirmed cases was
relatively small as shown in Figure 1(d). Therefore, we assumed that Japanese Twitter users are
not as interested in COVID-19 as in the major
English-speaking countries. In particular, there
was a decline in the number of microblogs from
March 12 to March 15, 2020. March 12, 2020,
was the Olympic flame lighting ceremony and the
torch relay for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.8 Therefore, we speculate that this sudden decrease was
caused by a shift in attention from COVID-19 to
the torch relay for many Japanese users.
With regard to the Chinese microblogs, the
trends of the numbers are shown in Figures 1(e)
and 1(f). These do not fully reflect the quantitative
trends of the confirmed cases owing to the limited
amount of the microblogs we could collect on a
daily basis.

Qualitative Analysis

In addition to the quantitative analysis, we show
an example of qualitative analysis based on our
dataset. As an initial attempt, we adopted a word
cloud, which is “an electronic image that shows
words used in a particular piece of electronic texts
or series of texts.”9 In word clouds, term frequency for each word in a corpus is proportional
to its font size, which enables us to grasp the top6

tations of these word clouds to demonstrate a possible text-mining approach that can be applied to
our dataset in Figure 2.
Note that we removed stop words followed by

and Japanese tokenization, we used Jieba10 and
Mecab11 , respectively. We also filtered out the
search keywords in each microblog to reduce the
disturbance of these keywords in the image.

word clouds contain the tokens of the video title,
i.e., “震源 (hypocenter),” “動画 (video),” and “和
訳 (Japanese translation).”

English Word Cloud

A US citizen who lived in Wuhan passed away
because of COVID-19 in Wuhan on February 8,
2020.12 This was the first casualty of a US citizen. The word cloud of this day, shown in Figure 2(a), contains the related words, e.g., “American,” “US,” “citizen,” and “die.”
Figure 2(b) is the word cloud on March 16,
2020, in which “social distancing,” an important
phrase to fight against the epidemic, appears notably. We can also notice that another socially
important phrase “stay home” has an increased in
size in our word cloud series from March 20, 2020.
4.2

Japanese Word Cloud

The first local transmission of COVID-19 inside
Japan was reported on January 28, 2020, as described in Section 3.2. Figure 2(c) shows the word
cloud on that day. It reflects the fact that the infected patient lived in Nara prefecture and drove
a sightseeing-tour bus that carried travelers from
Wuhan. We can observe the relevant keywords,
such as “奈 良 (Nara),” “バ ス (bus),” and “運
転 (drive).”
On March 24, 2020, Japan and International
Olympic Committee (IOC) officially agreed to
postpone the planned 2020 Tokyo Olympics until 2021.13 A notable change in Japanese word
cloud series can be found as the novel appearance
of the words “オリンピック (Olympics)” and
“延期 (postponing)” in that day’s figure (i.e., Figure 2(d)).
We can also notice that a YouTube video became viral in Japanese Twitter from around January 29 to February 6, 2020, by observing the
corresponding word clouds. The video was originally made by a Wuhan citizen and subtitled in
Japanese later by another YouTuber,14 which tells

Chinese Word Cloud

Figure 2(e) shows the word cloud on January
20, 2020, and also shows that the term “钟
南 山 (Zhong nanshan)” has a larger weight.
It was on January 20 that Dr. Zhong indicated
the existence of human-to-human transmission of
COVID-1915 that triggered extensive discussion
on Weibo.
Figure 2(f) shows the word cloud on March 10,
2020 and the word “方 舱 医 院 (mobile cabin
hospital)” was more conspicuous. According
to China’s National Health Commission, all of
Wuhan’s mobile cabin hospitals were closed on
March 10.16 The mobile cabin hospitals, which
were instrumental in preventing the spread of the
epidemic, also had attracted much attention.

Conclusion

We published a multilingual dataset of microblogs
related to COVID-19 collected by relevant query
keywords at https://github.com/sociocom/co
vid19_dataset. The dataset covered English and
Japanese tweets from Twitter and Chinese posts
from Weibo. The present version of the dataset
(April 20, 2020) encompassed microblogs from
January 20 to March 24, 2020.
We then showed one of the possible utilization
of our dataset through the daily microblog count
analysis as an example of the quantitative analyses
and the word cloud-based analysis as an example
of the qualitative analyses. The results of the analyses are summarized as follows. For China, which
is the first country to have faced a full-blown outbreak of COVID-19, we can observe from social media that people took the situation and prevention seriously. As the number of confirmed
cases in China decreased, the trend in social media
shifted toward the concern for the global situation.
In the UK and the US, the main English-speaking
countries, initially, there was less social media
interests owing to fewer confirmed cases. The
subsequent outbreaks sprung the discussion about

However, on March 24, 2020, the announcement
of the postponement of the 2020 Olympic Games
in Tokyo along with a relatively rapid growth of
confirmed cases was reflected in the increased social media activity. This was accompanied by microblogs expressing concerns about the epidemic
and dissatisfaction with government measures.
We believe that this dataset can be analyzed
further in many ways, such as sentiment-based
analysis17 , comparison with web search queries,
moving logs18,19 , etc. Various combinations of
data can enable deeper analyses of social media
communication. Furthermore, our dataset would
contribute to extract useful clinical information

from social media and render hints about efficient
broadcasting of the clinical information. We continue to collect the microblog data while keeping
the repository up-to-date.
