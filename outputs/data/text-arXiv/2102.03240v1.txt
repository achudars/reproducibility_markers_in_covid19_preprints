Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted human activities, leading to unprecedented decreases in
both global energy demand and GHG emissions. Yet a little known that there is also a “low carbon”
shift of the global energy system in 2020. Here, using the near-real-time data on energy-related
GHG emissions from 30 countries (~70% of global power generation), we show that the pandemic
caused an unprecedented de-carbonization of global power system, representing by a dramatic
decrease in the carbon intensity of power sector that reached a historical low of 414.9 tCO2eq/GWh
in 2020. Moreover, the share of energy derived from renewable and low-carbon sources (nuclear,
hydro-energy, wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass) exceeded that from coal and oil for the first
time in history in May of 2020. The decrease in global net energy demand (-1.3% in the first half of
2020 relative to the average of the period in 2016-2019) masks a large down-regulation of fossil-fuelburning power plants supply (-6.1%) coincident with a surge of low-carbon sources (+6.2%).
Concomitant changes in the diurnal cycle of electricity demand also favored low-carbon generators,
including a flattening of the morning ramp, a lower midday peak, and delays in both the morning
and midday load peaks in most countries. However, emission intensities in the power sector have
since rebounded in many countries, and a key question for climate mitigation is thus to what extent
countries can achieve and maintain lower, pandemic-level carbon intensities of electricity as part of
a green recovery.

Since late 2019, the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused more than a million deaths
worldwide1 . This has led to the largest disruption of human activities since World War II, with drastic
changes in energy consumption and generation patterns, leading to an unprecedented drop of CO2
emissions2-5. Moreover, the relative decrease of CO2 emissions from the electricity sector was
disproportionately greater than the decreases in electricity demand and generation, pointing to a reduction
in carbon intensity of the energy sector. For example, electricity use in China between January and April
of 2020 was 4.7%5 lower than during the same months of 2019, but the corresponding decrease in
electricity-related emissions was 6.0%6. In particular, coal power was more negatively affected by the
pandemic than other sources. The observed vulnerability of coal power to the negative demand shock of
COVID-19 in many countries leads us to speculate that this sector may be close to a tipping point, beyond
which substantial coal-fired generation capacity may become economically disadvantaged. This could
hasten the phasing-out of coal power plants worldwide7. Changes in electricity demand and supply during
the pandemic may thus have important lessons for near-term reductions in energy-related CO2 emissions,
but the necessary in-depth analysis is yet lacking.
High spatial- and temporal- source specific electricity data can help understand why de-carbonization
occurred and can help interpret the short-term immediate and long term effect COVID-19 has on the
electricity sector. Traditionally, this sector tend to be analyzed either in aggregated time scale (monthly or
yearly, often updated with time-lag) or for refined spatial locations (national or regional) 3. While monthly
or yearly aggregated data do provide knowledge base for evaluating the overall profiles of the electricity
sector, information on day-to-day and diurnal electricity consumption and generation patterns induced by
human behavior is unfortunately omitted. Regional daily electricity profiles can fill in some of this gap by
providing snapshots of certain specific locations. However, it fails in providing a dynamic integral portrait
of the global electricity system. A global scaled dataset on source specific electricity generation and
consumption, with high time frequency and with high spatial coverage is therefore urgently needed to
understand what exactly changes electricity sector has gone through during the pandemic globally, and
when and how these changes happened.
Here, we compiled and analyzed near-real-time, sub-hourly, sub-regionally electricity demand, electricity
generation and related emissions from January of 2016 to June of 2020 8 (see also: http://carbonmonitor.org).
Specifically, we quantify the patterns and drivers of global carbon intensity change in power generation
(defined as the amount of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases emitted per unit energy generated) since the
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We accomplished this by providing a long-term dataset revealing the
historical development and daily variations of the carbon intensity and the energy structure change (defined
as the proportion of electricity generated by each energy source) in global power generation, (2) examining

the drivers of the energy structure change during the pandemic by assessing the driving force: the electricity
demand pattern shift in the corresponding time period, (3) evaluating how the newly formed electricity
demand pattern since the COVID-19 pandemic facilitated the energy structure change by unfolding the
diurnal pattern shift of each energy source, (4) assessing the reversed process by evaluating the carbon
intensity and CO2 emission rebound from the electricity sector with the temporary recovery from lockdown
in summer 2020. We included all major electricity generation sources in this study, covering electricity
supplied by thermal power of oil, natural gas and coal, as well as, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar and other
renewables (mainly bioenergy and geothermal energy). We compiled sub-hourly, hourly and daily data from
30 countries that account for ~68% of global electricity generation and global carbon emissions (See
Supplementary Table S1).

Accelerated decline of global carbon intensity marked by declined fossil electricity and more
renewables
During the first half of 2020, the carbon intensity of electricity generated worldwide continued its fast
decline and reached a historical low of 414.9 tCO2eq/GWh (Fig1a). In May of 2020, the share of lowcarbon sources in the global power mix reached an historical high of 47%, reflecting increased shares of
electricity from low-carbon sources and decreased shares from fossil sources (Figs. 1b and 1c). Some of
the increases in wind and solar generation were related to exceptional weather conditions in some regions;
nuclear and hydro remained at the level of previous years, and biomass together with geothermal
decreased (Fig. 1b). Altogether, the share of low-carbon sources worldwide surpassed power generated
from coal and oil combined for the first time (Fig. 1b), growing by 2.4% in 2020--almost three times
faster than the average 2014-2019 (Fig. 1d). As a result, these changes led to a record decline of GHG
emission in the power sector by 24.2% (Fig. 1d; hereafter all reported changes refer to the period of
January 1st till July 1st relative to the same period in previous years).

Electricity demand is sensitive to seasonal temperature variations for winter heating in cold countries
and summer air conditioning in many subtropical and tropical countries9. Yet, the share of electricity in
the final energy use for heating varies substantially across countries, e.g., from 1% in Poland to 18% in
Spain. In addition to spurring electricity demand for air conditioning, hot conditions also reduce the
efficiency of thermal power plant operations, so that high temperatures also directly affect the mix of
power sources. The first few winter months of 2020 were exceptionally warm in many places10

(Supplementary Table S5), leading to a reduction of heating demand on top of the COVID-19 impacts.
During 2020 winter time (from January to March), out of the total energy generation decrease of 5.39%
(compared to 2019), we attributed 0.72% to abnormally warm temperatures (Least-Squares Regression
Model, see Methods). Out of all countries analyzed, we found medium to strong correlation between daily
electricity generation and daily average temperature in 18 countries, while taking into account public
holidays (modeled separately) and population density (temperature was first weighted by population
before modeling; country-specific results see Supplementary Table S4)
In order to filter seasonal temperature variations while retaining inter-annual temperature anomalies, we
first compiled the baseline electricity generation using data from 2016-2019 for each component of the
global power mix in Figure 2 (dashed lines and shaded areas, see also Supplementary Fig. S1). Both fossil
and nuclear which deliver the base power supply show a double seasonality with a peak in January and in
July: the summer peak being smaller than the winter one for oil (Fig 2d) and nuclear (Fig 2e), but higher
coal (Fig 2b) and gas (Fig 2c), which is mainly related to the exposure of countries with a different energy
mix to heating and cooling demands inferred from heating and cooling degree days (HDD 11 and CDD12).
Solar energy follows the solar radiation pattern in the northern hemisphere (Fig 2h), and hydro energy

peaks in summer (Fig 2f), mainly owing to a higher production in monsoon Asian countries 13. Wind
energy exhibits a broad maximum from the autumn to the spring equinox, consistent with the prevailing
intensity of the zonal atmospheric circulation in the northern hemisphere (Fig 2g). In the past five years,
wind and solar showed a steady increase, while other sources remained stable (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Then we compared the daily source specific electricity generation in 2020 (Fig 2, solid lines) to the
baseline values to compute the corresponding de-seasoned change. In the first six months of year 2020,
global power generation decreased by -1.5% (-121.2 TWh, Fig2a), Noticeably, Japan, the US and Europe
experienced the greatest relative declines of -11.8% (56.3 TWh), -8.5% (166.9 TWh) and -5.6% (80.1
TWh), respectively. In contrast, there was a net increase in China (+7.6%, 231.5TWh) because the
COVID-induced declines in February coincided with the timing of the annual Spring Festival when the
power supply is normally reduced (-0.3%, -1.5 TWh)
The development of different energy sources, however, were impacted differently by the pandemic in
2020. In the first half of 2020, the absolute amount of wind and solar power showed large positive
anomalies, +30.5% and +49.6%, explained by very windy conditions (in February in Western Europe) and
very sunny springs (in both Europe and US). In contrast, Figure 2b shows that coal power declined by the
end of January at the onset of the pandemic China and returned close to the monthly average by June
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Oil power had remained low since Jan 2020 despite the low prices. The share of

electricity from gas was higher than average before March, favored by low market prices of gas in the
U.S. and Europe allowing to switch rapidly to a higher gas share. Later, global gas power decreased to
reach within its monthly inter-annual variability from April to June (Fig 2c and Supplementary Table S4).



Declines in fossil electricity generation

In the first six months of 2020, electricity from fossil fuel sources decreased by -6.1% (292.2 TWh
Supplementary Fig S2), largely reflecting an -8.7% (-310.58 TWh) decrease in coal electricity (Fig2b).
The decline was caused by a combination of factors, including a negative trend of coal in the energy
mixes of Europe (-39.1%), the U.S. (-41.5%), and Japan (-9.8%), against the background of sharp

declines in economic activity due to public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in
industrial production (e.g., industrial demand declined by -5.2%, or -108.3 TWh in China, by -14.3%, or 73.7 TWh, in India, and by -20.8%, or -2.1 TWh, in Brazil; Supplementary Fig. S2).
Electricity from oil also began 2020 at lower than past year levels (-40.1%, -7.5 TWh in January), and
these lows continued during the pandemic, reflecting policies aimed at reducing the use of this fuel in
many countries14,15, with a total decline of 35.6% in the first 6 months of 2020 (76.5 TWh ± 18.9%). In
January, lower shares of electricity from oil were observed in Europe (-36.3%), the U.S. (-12.6%), Japan
(-13.0%), India (-48.0%) and Brazil (-65.8%), but oil electricity increased in China (+3.7% ). However,
during February and March, when China was under strict lockdown, Chinese electricity from oil did
decline by about -8% relative to the reference period.
In contrast to coal and oil, 2020 began with an increase in electricity supplied by natural gas (+4.8%,
+10.3 TWh growth in January, +9.2%, +12.2 TWh in February Fig2c), driven by rising gas use in Europe
(+13.3%, +6.46 TWh in January), the U.S. (+25.7%, +23.6 TWh in February), and Brazil (+52.2%, +2.0
TWh in January). However, the growth in gas use was cut short by the pandemic. Electricity from gas
decreased with lockdowns in the U.S., Europe, and Brazil (e.g., the reduced operation time of natural gas
energy operation systems) (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S2).


More renewables in the first half of 2020

We observe a substantial increase in global wind (+29.4% increase from 5.17×10 2 TWh ± 15% average of
2016-2019，Fig2g) and an even larger increase in solar power generation (+48.0% increase from 1.98 ×10 2
TWh ± 24.7%, average of 2016-2019, Fig2h). Meanwhile, there were small decreases in generation from
hydropower, biomass and other renewables, while global nuclear was similar as reference years. Altogether,
the share of low- carbon sources in the energy mix reached an historical high of 47% in May of 2020.

The strongest growth among all energy sources was seen in solar power, with a 49.4% increase in
January 2020, and a +52.5% increase in April. Furthermore, the increase of solar energy was observed in
every region/country analyzed and every month from January to June. The largest increase was in China,
with a rise of +60.8% (6.2 TWh) in January and of +88.4% (10.9 TWh) in April. Brazil and Japan also
show large solar energy growth (+221.3%, 1.7 TWh and +31.2%, 8.83 TWh respectively). Increases are
smaller but still substantial in Europe and the U.S. (+25.6%, 14.1 TWh and +16.3%, 5.3 TWh,
respectively).
Wind power was already 21.0 % higher than the reference (91.5 TWh ± 19.5%, 2016-2019 average,
Fig2g) in January 2020, mainly due to continuously increasing construction of wind power generation and

power purchasing activities in Europe, US and China15 (Supplementary Fig. S2). After a brief drop back
to the level as previous years at the end of January, global electricity from wind grew strongly throughout
the first half of year 2020, by a total of 29.0% (1.5 ×102 TWh). Wind energy increased in every
region/country analyzed in this study, though to different extents. The largest increase is in China
(+41.9%, 67.9 TWh), followed by Europe (+29.4%, 51.9 TWh) and the U.S. (+23.1%, 31.9 TWh).
In contrast to wind and solar energy sources, hydro-power began 2020 lower than the reference period
(-8.4% in January, compared to 1.82 ×102 TWh ± 2.7%, Fig2f), but reached around the reference level
from February untill June. Geothermal, biomass and other renewables have shown a 14.6% decline since
the beginning of year 2020 with no obvious change during the COVID-19 pandemic.


Contrasting regional development of Nuclear energy

Global nuclear energy did not show large changes during the first half of 2020 (9.58 ×102 TWh,
compared to 9.65 ×102 TWh ± 4.4%, Fig2e). However, there is a remarkable difference between
countries. In Europe (-12.1%), the U.S. (-3.2%), and Brazil (-7.3%), the shares of nuclear electricity
declined, while in China (+36.8%), India (+9.0%), and Japan (+60.8%), nuclear power generation
increased in the first half of 2020 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Nuclear power generation decline sharply in
China in February following the lockdown measures. However, no clear evidence of impact from
COVID-19 was observed in the nuclear energy production in other countries (Supplementary Fig S3).
Declined and shifted energy demand pattern following the COVID-19 pandemic
The global electricity demand and generation systems were immediately impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, and this impact induced change is not homogeneous throughout the day. By comparing the
diurnal cycle of power generation before and after COVID-19, with the same time period as reference,
we found 1) a flattening of morning ramp (the average power delivered per hour before the peak in
midday) 2) a lower peak demand, and 3) a delay in the peak time from around 8 AM before lockdown
(week 11) to as late as around 12 PM after lock downs (Fig. 3). For Europe and the U.S., both morning
demand peaks declined and peaks were delayed (Fig. 3). In the US, the evening peak surpassed or
equaled the morning one, whereas in Europe, the evening peak load declined to a similar level as the
morning peak.
The change of diurnal power profiles changed to a more “weekend-like” pattern after the lockdown.
Prior to lockdown, the 2020 weekday energy demand was very close to the weekday demand pattern of
2019 during thee same time period (Supplementary Figure S6). Immediately after the lockdown (around
week 12, as most global lockdown measures happend in this week), the energy demand profiles started

shifting to more weekend-like profiles, with lower and delayed morning peaks (Supplementary Figure
S6). These shifts indicate that the “working-from-home” thus remote working style had driven the change
in energy demand pattern.

EU27&UK, U.S., Japan and Brazil. Dashed line indicates week8-week11, which are the four weeks prior to

2020. Solid lines indicate the four weeks (week12 - week 15) when diurnal profiles were under the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. For 2019, solid lines and dashed lines indicate the same time period (but without
the influence of COVID-19). Vertical lines indicate the times for morning peaks in week8-week11 (prior-COVID
for 2020, green line) or in week12 - week 15 (post-COVID for 2020, blue lines). For diurnal patterns of other
countries, see Supplementary Fig. S5.

New electricity demand pattern as a driving force for increased share of low carbon sources in the
electricity system
A shift towards higher energy consumption around mid-day, while lower towards morning and night
time, likely have facilitated the increase of low-carbon energy (particularly solar) share in the energy mix.
Traditionally, power system is known to have to ramp up the thermal electricity to cope with the morning
peak (Fig. 3 and thermal electricity profiles in Supplementary Fig. S7). Because of the lowered and
delayed morning peak, and the generally lower daytime consumption, thermal power has lowered its
morning peak as well. This is reflected by the significant decline in the morning ramp rate change of the
“duck curve” (Fig. 4), or the electricity demand less solar electricity generation 16. Its characteristic
morning ramp and evening ramp (climb from midday low point to evening peak) have both changed
significantly following the lockdown measures. Compared to pre-COVID days, and to the same time

period of reference year 2019, the post-COVID morning and evening ramp rates have declined at global
scale (Fig. 5). The evening ramp rate decline is much more obvious for the U.S., caused by the increased
midday consumption.

Figure 4 | Non-solar electricity consumption ramp rate change in 2019 and in 2020 for the periods before
and after lockdowns Summary of changes in “duck curves” (i.e. solar-excluded electricity consumption, see
Supplementary Fig. S6). Morning ramp rate is computed by dividing the morning ramp height by the hours this
ramp lasted (time taken for the energy consumption to reach from the lowest point to the morning peak). Morning
ramp height is computed as the energy consumption difference between morning peak (highest energy
consumption before midday) and the midnight lowest point (usually around 4AM). Evening ramp rate is

computed by dividing the evening ramp height by the hours this ramp lasted. Evening ramp is defined as the
difference in energy consumption between midday lowest demand and the evening peak (highest consumption
during after midday, usually occurs around 7-8PM).

The diurnal patterns of each electricity sourses were affected differently during the COVID-19
pandemic period (Fig. 6). The most noticeable change is that thermal power from coal and gas declined
more during day time, as a result of adjusting to the lowered morning consumption peak demand, and of
adjusting to a higher day-time renewable energy production. In the U.S. in 2020, we observe increases in
gas power compensating for decreased coal power in the U.S. during the afternoon in March, and during
the night in April and May (Fig. 5). In Europe, there was a similar increase of gas power during morning
hours in March when the weather was colder than in 2019, and a strong morning decrease in April and
May that were warmer than in 2019 (Supplementary Table S3). As solar power peaking around midday
was much above average in 2020, coal energy also declined during midday (Fig 5). Similar changes are
also detected at smaller spatial scales (national and sub-national, Supplementary Fig. 4). Although coal
generation was already lower than in 2019 for Europe and the U.S. in January and February, that preCOVID deficit was uniformly distributed throughout the day (Fig. 6). After the lockdowns, this pattern
changed to more decline during the day, especially around 8 AM (coal power in the U.S. and in coal and
gas power combined in Europe). This could be explained by the flattened morning peaks in energy
demand profiles (Fig. 3). As there is less electricity demand at around 8AM, likely caused by life styles
changing towards widely practiced remote working.

Figure 5 | Source-specific Power generation Difference between 2020 and 2019, shown as monthly averaged
diurnal pattern, for month January to June. Positive values indicate an increase of power generation at a given
time of the day in year 2020 compared to 2019, white negative values indicate a decrease. The profiles are
computed by taking the difference between the monthly averaged diurnal patterns of energy generated by each
source from year 2020 and year 2019. Global profiles include data from Europe (EU27&UK), US, Japan and
Brazil. Regional comparisons of other major countries/regions see Supplementary Fig S4.

Rebound of fossil fuel power generation
The transient drop of carbon intensity in the power sector during the first half of 2020 appears to result

from a combination of three factors: a lower demand from declined industrial and commercial activities; a
market-driven substitution from coal to gas especially in the U.S.; and an exceptional supply of both solar
and wind power occurring at the same time in Europe, the US and China, although during different
months in each of these countries/regions. However, fossil fuel power generation and emission intensities
have rebounded in many countries/regions. Since May 2020 this rebound was mainly contributed by
China and countries with released lockdown measures. The carbon intensity in May reached back to its
level of 2019 at the same time of year. To gain insights into the drop of GHG emissions from the power
sector (Fig1), we decomposed monthly emission changes from 2016 to mid-2020 into the contributions
of changes in total power generation (activity) versus changes in energy sources mix (structure). Results
(shown in Fig6, given as decomposed contributions to change in GHG emissions, with reference to the
same time period in 2016) suggest that from January 2017 to January 2019, increased activity (increased
power generation) outpaced the improvement in structure (increased low carbon sources’ share) globally.
In addition, the global decomposition is similar to that of China, the largest emitter. From January, 2019
to the beginning of the first lockdown in 2020 (in Wuhan, China), improved structure is noticeable,
contributed mainly by Europe and secondarily by the U.S.. After the first lockdown in China, the sharp
decline of global emissions is explained by both decreased activity (59%) and improved share of low
carbon sources in energy mix (41%). There was no clear improvement in energy mix related to the 2020
lockdown in China compared to 2019, a higher low carbon share in energy mix in Europe than in 2019,
while in the U.S., the decreased emissions is mainly explained by decreased activity (Fig. 6).

the final month and the GHG emissions from the same month in previous year.

Discussion
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the carbon intensity of the global power sector reached historic lows.
Although there were many factors underlying this decarbonization, three drivers are most prominent:
First, electricity generation from solar and wind--which have been growing strongly for years--reached
new highs in many regions. Meanwhile, sudden and substantial drops in electricity demand were
disproportionately met by turning down fossil fuel-fired power plants. The decrease in fossil fuel use
makes economic sense despite low oil and gas prices given the near-zero marginal costs of solar and wind
electricity, but the greater use of variable renewable energy sources--and particularly solar--was further
bolstered by shifts in the diurnal pattern of energy demand, with lower ramp rates and peak loads that
were lower and nearer to the middle of the day (i.e. loads that were easier for the available renewable
sources to meet).
We analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on global power system with a novel near-real-time country
specific, source specific data-set. With this approach, we are able to detect the immediate and long-term
impact of lockdown measures on the global power generation and consumption system. Our results show
that as individual behaviours change in response to lockdown measures, the diurnal cycle of power
systems distorted strongly in 2020, which favored solar power by moving the peak demand closer to the
peak of daytime radiation. However, there are still uncertainties remained in our results. Although we
have provided a fairly comprehensive dataset for the purpose of this study, there are still limitations in
daily availability in general. High-time resolution and high quality sub-hourly data remains a challenge to
acquire for some parts of the world. Secondly, for the GHG emission estimation we applied an IPCC lifecycle emission factor based approach. Uncertainties may rise from the emission factors, which are
assumed to be universal for a given power source sector. In future studies, country-specific and timespecific emission factors may be applied to reduce these uncertainties.
However, in China and other countries, the end of lockdowns was followed by a rapid rebound of fossil
power generation. Although our analyses demonstrate the potential of existing renewable electricity
sources to be robust and reliable sources of power, the return to normal levels and timing of electricity

demand are dragging the carbon intensity of electricity systems around the world back up. Yet the
transient changes during the pandemic suggest that focused investments under a green recovery could be
influential. In particular, the economic viability of coal-fired power seems near a tipping point in many
regions17. such that modest additional deployment of renewables and energy storage technologies (the
latter of which could act to shave and redistribute intraday peaks) might trigger large and permanent
decreases in the shares of coal power and thus the carbon intensity of electricity.

Methods
Data availability and process. We focused on six countries/regions, i.e., China, India, United States,
Europe (EU27 & UK), Japan and Brazil in this research. The total electricity generation of these regions
accounts for ~68% of the global energy production (see Supplementary Table S1). We compiled and
estimated hourly and sub hourly power generation and demand data with publicly available datasets
(Table 1). Time zone-corrected electricity data, which are collected at the sub-regional or sub-national
levels such as in the U.S. and Europe, are then combined into the national or regional total.
We defined eight major energy source categories in this study: coal, gas, oil, nuclear, hydro-power, wind,
solar and other (note that “other” represents the combined category for biomass, geothermal and other
renewables). For data sources in which sub-categorical data are provided, we aggregated these subcategories to one of the eight categories summarized above. For example, onshore wind and offshore
wind are both included in wind energy in this study. In addition, thermal and low carbon energy sources
are defined based on the energy sources’ carbon intensity. Thermal energy includes energy produced by
coal, gas and oil. Low carbon energy includes energy produced by nuclear, hydro-power, wind, solar,
biomass, geothermal and other renewables. According to data availability (Table 1), sub-categorical data
were re-grouped to the eight major energy source categories described above. The detailed contents of

Least-Squares Regression Method
We estimated the temperature induced power generation change by establishing a linear regression model
between the daily power generation in year 2018 & 2019 with the temperature on the corresponding day,
for each country, the following model (Eq.1) is established:
𝐸𝑐 = 𝛼𝑐 𝑇𝑐 + 𝛽𝑐
(Eq.1)
For each country c, the and are estimated by minimizing the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE ), expressed as
Eq.2:
1

1
2
RMSE = (∑ni=1 (𝐸̂
𝑐,𝑖 − 𝐸𝑐,𝑖 ) )2
n

(Eq.2)

Where 𝐸̂
𝑐,𝑖 is the calculated power generation for country c, day i with Eq.1, and the 𝐸𝑐,𝑖 is the actual
power generation for country c, day i. The criteria for establishing a meaningful linear regression model
between the power generation and temperature is that the linear relationship between power generation
(Ec) and temperature (Tc) is strong enough, i.e. temperature variation can explain the majority of the
change in electricity generation. Therefore, we excluded public holidays, when social activities contribute
substantially to power generation change. The criteria for a medium to strong linear relationship is that
the R-squared value of the established model is above 0.6. Once the regression model is established, we
calculated the theoretical power generation change with the temperature difference between 2020 and

2019 on the same day.
Emission Calculation.
The emissions from the energy mix are calculated by multiplying the activity data (i.e., electricity
production) and the emission factors by energy types (Eq. 3)18.
GHG Emissions = Σ(Activity Datai × Emission Factori )

(Eq. 3)

In this study, we analyze the GHG emissions from the whole life cycle of electricity production. The
life cycle GHG emissions are associated with the upstream energy consumption and the embodied energy
use for building power stations and operation19, which are frequently used to analyze the environmental
cost and carbon footprint of different power generation technologies 20. Here, We use the life cycle
emission factors by different technologies from the IPCC (2015)21 (see Supplementary Table S2) to assess
the GHG emissions over the whole life cycle per unit electricity generated. Different technologies show
large discrepancies on their life cycle emissions. For example, nuclear energy is one of the lowest GHG
emission technologies. The life cycle GHG emissions of nuclear generated electricity is only 1/30 of the
emissions caused by coal generated electricity.
The carbon intensity of energy mix is calculated by the following equation (Eq. 4), defined as the GHG
emitted per unit of electricity produced:
Carbon Intensity= GHG emissions/Electricity Production

(Eq. 4)

Index Decomposition Analysis.
The Logarithmic Mean Divisa Index (LMDI) decomposition method was proposed to solve diﬀerent
decomposition problems in 199821. Here, LMDI is adopted to perform the residual-free decomposition of
the factors affecting GHG emissions. The expression is shown in Eq. 5) (adopted from literature22,23):
E = ∑i E i = ∑i Q

Qi Ei
Q Qi

= ∑i QSi Ii

(Eq. 5)

Where E is the total GHG emission (expressed as CO2-eq), Q is the gross generation from energy,
and Si and Ii are the shares of electricity i generation and emission factor (CO2-eq/generation) of
electricity source i, respectively. Taking 2016 as the baseline year (each month in 2016 as the baseline
months), thus the contribution of each driving factor causing the emission change (difference in GHG
emissions between the tth month and the base month) can be expressed as the following equation (Eq. 6):

∆𝐸𝑡 = 𝐸𝑡 − 𝐸0 = ∆𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡 + ∆𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑟 + ∆𝐸𝑖𝑛𝑡

(Eq. 6)

Where ∆E is the difference between the GHG emissions from the tth month (𝐸 𝑡 ) and the GHG
emissions from the baseline month (𝐸0 ). In this study, by developing the time-series manner, 𝐸0 from
January 2016 to June 2019 and 𝐸𝑡 from January 2017 to June 2020 are considered with one month step.
∆𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡 , ∆𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑟 , and ∆𝐸𝑖𝑛𝑡 represent the activity effect, the energy structure effect, and the emission
intensity effect, respectively. Activity effect is indicated by gross power generation, energy structure
effect is indicated by energy's share of power generation, and emission intensity effect is indicated by
energy's emission factor, which is shown in Eq.7 - Eq.10:
𝑄𝑡

∆𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡 = ∑𝑖 𝑤𝑖 ln( 𝑖0 )
𝑄𝑖

𝑆𝑡

∆𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑟 = ∑𝑖 𝑤𝑖 ln( 𝑖0 )
𝑆𝑖

𝐼𝑡

∆𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑟 = ∑𝑖 𝑤𝑖 ln( 𝑖0 )
𝐼𝑖

𝑤𝑖 =

𝐸𝑖𝑡 −𝐸𝑖0

ln 𝐸𝑖𝑡 −ln 𝐸𝑖0

(Eq.7)
(Eq.8)
(Eq.9)
(Eq. 10)

Where 𝑄 𝑡 , 𝑆 𝑡 , and 𝐼 𝑡 are the power generation, energy structure, and emission factor of the t th month,
respectively. 𝑄 0 , 𝑆 0 , and 𝐼 0 are the power generation, energy structure, and emission factor of the
baseline month, respectively.
