The spatialization of socioeconomic data can be used and integrated with other sources of information
to reveal valuable insights. Such data can be utilized to infer different variations, such as the dynamics
of city dwellers and their spatial and temporal variability. This work focuses on such applications to
explore the underlying association between socioeconomic characteristics of different geographical
regions in Dublin, Ireland, and the number of confirmed COVID cases in each area. Our aim is to
implement a machine learning approach to identify demographic characteristics and spatial patterns.
Spatial analysis was used to describe the pattern of interest in Electoral Divisions (ED), which are
the legally defined administrative areas in the Republic of Ireland for which population statistics are
published from the census data. We used the most informative variables of the census data to model
the number of infected people in different regions at ED level.

1. Introduction
In March 11th, 2020, the Republic of Ireland’s government launched a national action plan in response to COVID19, a widespread lock-down in order to minimize the risk
of illness. The impacts of pandemics such as the current
COVID-19 should be explored extensively. To mitigate and
recover from the negative repercussions, it is of paramount
importance to study the effects on the social tissue in cities.
It seems that various research is needed to thoroughly investigate, understand, mitigate and recover from the effect
of this pandemic. Some studies have been focused on providing risk assessment frameworks based on artificial intelligence and leveraging data generated from heterogeneous
sources such as disease-related data, demographic, mobility, and social media data [29, 33, 12, 3, 32]. The exposure
risk of the pandemic in different environments has been assessed. Many researchers are exploring the dynamics of the
pandemic in urban areas to mitigate effects and understand
the impacts of COVID-19 on cities [26, 33, 7]. In this area
of research, four distinctive categories have received significant attention: environmental quality, socio-economic impacts, management and governance, and transportation and
urban design [30]. As far as the socio-economic impacts
are concerned, pandemics can substantially negatively affect people at the bottom of the socio-economic hierarchy,
those with low education, low income, and low-status jobs.
For instance, it has been discussed that the Black and Latino
people’s mortality rate is twice that of the Whites in the US
[38]. The pandemics can also hit vulnerable groups of people in poor sanitary conditions. Moreover, various factors
such as high density, inadequate access to health services and
infrastructure facilities can exacerbate the situation [9, 25].
Different inequality issues can also make it difficult to main⋆

tain social distancing [35]. Hence, it is essential to understand the existed relation between socio-economic inequalities and the pandemic. As discussed, such inequalities can
threaten public health by making it difficult to enforce protective measures such as social distancing.
Artificial Intelligence technologies such as Neural Networks and Deep learning can play a significant role during a
pandemic. They can be used to provide different platforms
for social distance tracking [1, 23], monitor and control the
spread of COVID-19 [4, 44]. Such technology has been
used in this study. We assess the association between the
demographic features and the number of confirmed cases
at Electoral Divisions (i.e., ED) in Dublin, Ireland based
on an optimized self-organizing neural network. It should
be mentioned that the number of cases until September 10,
2020, have been considered in this work. Our aim is to understand the impacts of the pandemic on Dublin city given
associated characteristics and study the related patterns in
different clusters obtaining from demographic information,
i.e., census data. We used a machine learning method based
on an unsupervised learning approach to group spatial data
into meaningful clusters. In doing so, the similarities among
spatial objects were taken into account. Given the implemented model, the implicit information about different EDs
were extracted, and all associated relations were examined.
Such data exploration can help us extract demographic information related to various clusters. First, a feature selection
method was used to extract the most relevant variables since
the census data includes over 700 features, and redundant
features can significantly affect the model accuracy. Feature extraction aims to project high-dimensional data sets
into lower-dimensional ones in which relevant features can
be preserved. These features, then, were used to distinguish
patterns. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection/extraction
methods [13], e.g., principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and canonical correlation
analysis (CCA), play a critical role in dealing with noise
and redundant features. These methods were used as a prePage 1 of 12

processing phase of data analysis and helped us obtain better
insights and robust decisions.
Broadly speaking, dimensionality reduction is considered as a method to remove redundant variables. This technique can be regarded as two distinctive approaches, i.e.,
feature extraction and feature selection. Feature extraction
refers to those techniques that project original variables to
a new latent space with lower dimensionality, while feature
selection methods aim to choose a subset of variables such
that a trained model minimizes redundancy and maximizes
relevance to the target feature. In this work, we deal with a
clustering problem and high-dimensionality issue; hence, a
feature extraction technique was used. Since interpreting associated patterns in feature extraction methods can be a subjective process, different tests were implemented to deal with
related issues such as readability and interpretability. PCA
is a classic approach to dimensionality reduction (feature extraction) and has been implemented in various research studies. However, it suffers from a global linearity issue. Thus,
to address this concern, a nonlinear technique (i.e., kernel
PCA [19]) was used in this work.
Then, the extracted features from the census data were
fed into a clustering model, and different clusters were identified. The goal in this phase is to cluster EDs (including
various demographic variables) such that similarities among
them within each group are maximized. The model is based
on an advanced spatial clustering technique and can deal
with non-linear relationships between features of a high dimensional data set. To do so, we implemented an unsupervised approach based on an Artificial Neural Network
(ANN) that can properly transform geo-referenced data into
information. The main property of ANNs is their ability to
learn and model nonlinear and complex relationships. The
model employ a competition-based learning mechanism to
generate insights from unlabelled data. It leverages a multilayer clustering approach, i.e., a self-organizing neural network [8, 43], to transform a complex high-dimensional input space into low dimensional output space while preserving the topology of the data. Given a set of EDs, the model
groups together different spatial objects that are similar with
other (i.e., the distance among observations is minimized in
a given cluster). Different validity measures were also applied and the results are illustrated. For visualization, we
use the shapefile of Dublin. Fig. 1 demonstrates the Dublin
shapefile, including different districts.
The contributions of this work are as follows:
1. The link between the number of confirmed Covid cases
and socio-economic determinants at Electoral Division level in Dublin, Ireland is analyzed based on an
AI-based spatial clustering method.
2. A topology-preserving model is implemented to explore nonlinear relationship among Electoral Divisions
given the census data to characterize the spatial distribution of city dwellers.

2. Related Work
Due to the global spread of coronavirus, many researchers
across the world are working to understand the underlying
patterns of the pandemic from different perspectives. They
are looking for effective ways to manage the flow of people and prevent new viral infections. As expected, numerous research has been undertaken as to medical concerns
(e.g., diagnosis and treatment of the disease like lung disease, lung nodules, chronic inflammation, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) to ensure all required measures are
in place. Different strategies, such as chest computed tomography imaging [42] and polymerase chain reaction [18],
have been discussed for detecting and classifying COVID-19
infections. Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have also
been used in the field of medical data analysis [4], and different algorithms have been implemented for such analysis
and patients’ classification. Different neural network techniques have been utilized for diagnosis based on identified
clinical characteristics such as cough, fever, sputum development, and pleuritic chest pain [20, 24]. Various impacts

of the pandemic on urban areas have also attracted the attention of researchers. In [2], the authors have introduced
a novel method to identify regions with high human density and mobility, which are at risk for spreading COVID-19
by exploiting cellular-network functionalities. In doing so,
they have used the frequency of handover and cell selection
events to identify the density of congestion. Several visualization techniques like Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
[37], Class-specific Saliency Map, and Gradient-weighted
Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) [17] has been used
to generate localization heatmaps in order to highlight crucial areas that are closely associated with the pandemic. Rustam et al., have implemented four Machine Learning models, such as linear regression, least absolute shrinkage, and
selection operator, support vector machine, and exponential
smoothing to understand the threatening factors of COVID19 [27]. Different features, such as the number of newly infected cases, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries have been taken into account in their model.
Network analysis, as a set of integrated techniques, can
be used to provide direct visualization of the pandemic risk.
By illustrating the degree of similarity among various areas given confirmed cases, So et al. have demonstrated that
network analysis can provide a relatively simple yet powerful way to estimate the pandemic risk [34]. Such analysis
can also supplement traditional modelling techniques to improve global control and prevention of the disease and provide more timely evidence to inform decision-making in crisis zones. In [22], the authors have presented a methodology
to identify spreaders using the analysis of the relationship between socio-cultural and economic characteristics with the
number of infections and deaths caused by the virus in different countries. The authors have explored the effect of socioeconomics, population, gross domestic product, health,
and air connections by solving a vertex separator problem in
multiplex complex networks.
Targeting policy responses to crises such as the current
pandemic and interventions exclusively on people who live
in deprived areas requires insights such as which clusters in
society are most affected. In this work, we explore demographic and socioeconomic factors and investigate the role
of socioeconomic factors in the spread of COVID-19. Our
aim is to analyze underlying features obtained from census
data and describe such demographic information concerning
the geolocation of patients. We study the link of the pandemic with such factors. Fig. 2 illustrates different phases
of the proposed model.

3. Data Processing
Geodemographic is referred to as the study of spatial patterns and socio-economic characteristics of different areas.
Associated demographic databases, such as census data, can
be used to understand population diversity better since they
include characteristics of a country’s inhabitants. Generally
speaking, Spatio-temporal datasets can be divided into different categories, such as geo-referenced data points, geoM. Ghahramani et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

referenced time series, moving objects, and trajectories. The
estimation of a region’s population has been a critical application of geospatial science in demography. In this sense,
geodemographic clustering can be considered as a tool to
understand spatially dependent datasets. This kind of clustering is unsupervised learning that groups spatial data into
meaningful clusters based on similarities among various areas. The learning procedure is correlated to the tendency of
people to associate themselves with others who have common characteristics. Census data can be considered as a
reference for overall population estimation. It includes information about individuals who have been counted within
households in different regions. Such data sets have some
special characteristics such as geospatial features. They consist of measurements or observations taken at specific locations, referenced by latitude and longitude coordinates and/or
associated within specific regions (in this work Electoral Divisions). Census data for the population living in the Republic of Ireland are available at a different level, i.e., Small Area
and Electoral Division (ED), from a survey taken in 2016.
However, since the number of confirmed cases are available
at EDs, the census data at such administrative areas were incorporated.

3.1. Dataset
Demographic information is available at the local population level via censuses carried out by countries. In Ireland,
a census is conducted at five-year periods by the government,
with the most recent census prior to this work occurring in

2016. The census of Ireland is disseminated by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and provides a vast amount of
information. Spatial data like a census typically involves a
large number of observations, meaning analysis of this nature tends to involve complex multivariate analysis and machine learning methods [16, 15, 14]. There are 322 EDs
in Dublin, and the census consists of 764 features (relating to, for example, age, household size, marriage status,
and education levels etc.) for each of 322 EDs. The census reports the features as a count of people. We converted
these features to percentages of the population within each
ED. Some sample records are presented in Table 1. The
number of Covid cases are also aggregated in this Table.
There are no missing values or outliers in the census data.
The dataset were normalized; the variables were scaled and
transformed so that they each make an approximately equal
contribution to the results. For example, there are about
100 variables relating to age information in the raw census data that they are summarized into percentages of different age bands; and there are about 40 variables relating
to education levels that are converted to percentages of people holding a third-level higher education degree and above
for each area. Take some variables demonstrated in Table 1
as an example. The variables T1-1AGE0M, T1-1AGE1M,
T1-1AGE2M, T1-1AGE3M, and T1-1AGE4M, which refer
to the number of people in different age bands (infants to
four years old) have been merged, and a new feature Age04 has been created. In total, we extracted 53 variables that
are synthesized from the census data, and a subset of these
variables is presented in Table 2. For the sake of brevity,
not all summarized census variables are presented and discussed in detail. All the features created in this phase are
used in a dimensionality reduction phase to be explained
later. It should be mentioned that spatial features cannot be
illustrated or modelled in a simple way due to their complex
characteristics, e.g., size, boundaries, direction and connectivity. Hence, spatial analysis is more sophisticated than relational data processing in terms of algorithmic efficiency
and the complexity of possible patterns because interrelated
information at a spatial scale has to be considered. Therefore, spatial or geodemographic clustering is used for grouping and labelling geographical neighbourhoods in terms of
their social and economic characteristics. Such an approach
can be used to understand our spatially dependent data and
the potential underlying associations between this data and
confirmed number of Covid cases. Such applications allow
similarities between patient structures in different EDs to be

highlighted, geodemographically speaking.
Each observation (EDs consisting of demographic information) can be defined as an m-tuple (𝑚 is the number of
features).
Let matrix 𝑋 ∈ 𝐑𝑛×𝑚 as:

where 𝐑 is the real number set, 𝑋𝑖 is the 𝑖th region and its
corresponding variables (m-tuple), and 𝑛 is the number of
all areas. As stated earlier, we deal with high dimensionality in this work. Such datasets can pose serious challenges,
such as model overfitting. The more the number of variables
increases, the more the chance of overfitting.

3.2. Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction is the process of eliminating
redundant variables. To handle such concerns, different approaches have been considered in the literature. Generally
speaking, feature extraction and feature selection techniques
are applied to reduce data dimensionality. In the former approach, original features are mapped to a new feature space
with lower dimensionality. The latter refers to those methods that identify and select a subset of features such that
the trained model (based on the selected features) minimizes
redundancy and maximizes relevance to the target feature.
PCA is the most common dimensionality reduction approach;
however, the transformation applied is linear. But when data
follow a nonlinear structure, as in our case, approximating
the model by a linear method like PCA will not perform well
on the original data. Likewise, Multidimensional Scaling
[28] and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [11, 31]
suffer from the linearity issue. To address this shortcoming,
nonlinear techniques such as Kernel PCA, Laplacian Eigenmaps [36], and Semidefinite Embedding [40] can be used.
The two first-mentioned methods have been applied in this
work. The result of the Kernel PCA is illustrated to save
space. We can define the variance-covariance matrix as

It should be mentioned that we have constructed the kernel

where 𝑐 is a constant. Given the measured variance for each

We have also examined the relevance of all features using
the coefficient of determination. In doing so, the proportion
of the variances have been tested. A supervised learner has
been used, and iteratively one feature of the dataset has been
considered as the dependent variable and others as the independent variables. The Hopkins statistic, which is a way
of measuring the clustering tendency of a data set, has been
calculated for both scenarios with the value of 0.59 before
dimensionality reduction and 0.67 after that phase. A value
close to 1 indicates that the data is highly clustered. Fig. 3 illustrates the result of the dimensionality reduction given the
Kernel PCA approach. Given the fraction of variances measured in this phase and also given all the weights associated
to each feature, 21 features, such as percentage of population aged 65 and over, percentage of house-share household,
and percentage of the unemployed population, have been selected. All these features have been integrated with two additional variables, i.e., the population of each ED and the
number of confirmed covid cases in each of those areas. The
final dataset is then used in the second phase (i.e., clustering)
of the model.

4. Clustering Approach
After performing all the data preprocessing operations
explained above, a clustering method can be implemented to
find underlying patterns. Due to characteristics of this work,
i.e., non-linear dynamics, an unsupervised learning mechanism based on a vector quantization technique [41] has been
considered. It should be mentioned that most neural network approaches operate based on the non-linear optimization of a criterion, which may result in the local minimum
issue and/or the convergence may take a long time. It has
been discussed that self-organizing maps are less sensitive to
such concerns. This approach is motivated by retina-cortex
mapping and considered as an optimal technique for vector
quantization problems. The topographic mechanism used in
this method can enable us to study relationships among spatial and non-spatial features and identify associated patterns.
The model is self-organized and operates based on learning
rules and neuron interactions. The learning process is based
on cooperation and competition among neurons. Moreover,
neurons maintain proximity relationships during the learning process. The idea is to quantize the input space into
a finite number of vectors. All observations in the input
space (census vectors, together with the number of Covid
cases in each spatial area) are projected to post-synaptic neurons in the latent space. The implemented model can transform all the census features in the input space into a lowdimensional discrete output space while preserving the relationships among variables. To do so, all vectors are mapped
to neurons based on synaptic connections, each of which is

assigned with weights. These weights are updated such that
adjacent neurons on the lattice have similar values. The clustering procedures consists of different phases, i.e., competition, collaboration, and weight updating.
In the competition phase of the algorithm, a predefined
number of neurons are initialized by randomly setting their
weights using census features. Neurons compete for each input vector’s ownership, and the most similar neuron (given
the distance measure between an ED object together with all
relevant features and all neurons) to a given observation is
detected. The winning neuron is called the Best Matching
Unit (BMU). There are different distance measures to find
the similarity between neurons and an input vector, such as
the Euclidian distance, Correlation tests, and Cosine similarity. However, the squared Euclidean distance is often used in
a real application. Let 𝑋𝑖 be the 𝑖th input vector (i.e., 𝑖th ED’s
features) and 𝑊𝑗 the associated weights of the 𝑗 th neuron.
∑ ∑
Then, the distance matrix 𝐷𝑖𝑗 = 1𝑛 𝑛𝑖=1 𝑘𝑗=1 (𝑋𝑖 − 𝑊𝑗 )2
can be defined as:

The BMU can be measured according to

𝑗

In the collaboration phase, the adjacent neurons of a given
BMU are updated. The aim is to find out which of the nonwinning neurons are within the BMU’s neighbourhood detected in the previous phase. To do so, the spatial location of a topological neighbourhood of the excited neuron
is detected. Several neighbourhood functions can be used to
calculate the neighbourhood radius, i.e., Rectangular, Mexican hat, and Gaussian functions. The latter (i.e., Gaussian
function) is the most commonly used one and has been utilized in this work. The cooperative process in this phase
starts with defining an initial neighbourhood radius, which
shrinks throughout different iterations based on the neighbourhood function. For each neuron 𝑗 (𝑁𝑗 ) in the neighborhood of the 𝑖th winning neuron (𝑁𝑖 ), the algorithm updates all the weights associated with the 𝑗 th neuron based on
a learning rate. It should be mentioned that the weights of
other neurons outside of 𝑁𝑖 neighbourhood are not adjusted
(in a given iteration). The procedure can be defined by the
function below:

𝜆(𝜉𝑖𝑗 ) = 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−

𝜉𝑖𝑗2
2𝜎 2

)

(11)

where 𝜆(𝜉𝑖𝑗 ) is the topological neighborhood value of the
𝑖th winning neuron (𝑁𝑖 ), 𝜉𝑖𝑗 is a lateral distance (the distance between Ψ𝑖 and its adjacent neurons 𝑁𝑗 ), and 𝜎 is a

function of the number of iterations and starts with an initial value (𝜎𝑜 ). A decay function (− 𝑇𝑛 ) is also employed,
𝜎(𝑛) = 𝜎𝑜 .𝑒𝑥𝑝(− 𝐺𝑛 ), where 𝑛 is the number of iterations, and
𝐺 is a constant. By defining the distance function formulated
above, the neighbourhood territory for updating all adjacent
neurons is explored. Two different connections, i.e., shortrange excitatory connections and long-range inhibitory interconnections, are used during the projection process. The
former is utilized at the presynaptic layer and the latter at the
postsynaptic one. The process can be expressed as:
𝜕𝑌𝑗 (𝑛)

∑
∑
𝑊𝑖𝑗 (𝑛)𝑋𝑖 (𝑛) +
𝜂𝑘 𝑌𝑘∗ (𝑛) −

𝑘

where 𝜏 is a constant, 𝑊𝑖𝑗 (𝑛) is the synaptic strength between input vectors at the presynaptic layer and neurons at
the postsynaptic layer, 𝜂𝑘 and 𝛾𝑘 are connection weights at
the presynaptic and postsynaptic layers, respectively, and 𝑌 ∗
is an active neuron at the postsynaptic layer.
In the third phase, two methods (i.e., Hebb’s rule [39, 21]
and Forgetting rule [6]) for adjusting weights of neurons are
considered. Based on the Hebb’s rule, the change of the
synaptic weight (Δ𝑊 ) is a function of relative neuron spike
timing and is proportional to the correlation between an input (𝑋) and an output (𝑌 ) of a network, i.e.,

Δ𝑊 =

where Θ is the learning rate (0 < Θ < 1). A sigmoid function has been applied during the learning process on the outputs to make sure that they are not negative.

where Θ(𝑛) is the learning rate for the 𝑛th iteration, 𝑊𝑗 (𝑡) is
the weight vector of the 𝑗 th neuron, and 𝜆 is a neighborhood
function. The learning rate is also a function of time and
decreases monotonically, i.e.,
Θ(𝑛) = Θ0 𝑒𝑥𝑝(

𝑛
)
−𝐺2

where Θ0 is an initial value, 𝐺 is a constant, and 𝑛 is the
number of iterations.
After the weights for all the input vectors are calculated,
both the learning rate and the radius are diminished. The
postsynaptic weights are adjusted to resemble the census features and reflect its properties as closely as possible. To sum
up the procedures, the pseudo-code of the implemented Selforganizing map is presented in Algorithm 1. The summary
of notations used is also given in Table 3. Two quantization
and organization criteria have been utilized to measure the
reliability of the model. Given such validity measures, the
sensitive parameters of the algorithm have been adjusted. A
discussion regarding the settings of the algorithm such as the
learning rate, the size of lattice (the number of neurons), and
level of similarities among neurons are presented next.

4.1. Algorithm Convergence and Parameter
Settings
The learning rate and the number of units needed should
be set in the algorithm, while the level of similarities among
units and the proper number of clusters are designated thereafter. Different techniques can be utilized to explore the
convergence of the algorithm, such as Quantisation Error

and probabilistic models. It should be noted that there is no
exact cost function that a self-organizing map (SOM) follows
precisely. As explained before, two criteria (i.e., QE and
topology preservation metric) have been taken into account
to ensure that the output of the model is reliable. The quantization metric was used to assess the required number of neurons. The squared distance between an observation 𝑋𝑖 and
its corresponding neuron was calculated. In other words, an
optimization problem was solved based on the similarity between vectors at presynaptic and postsynaptic layers. The ultimate synaptic weights of neurons were achieved after running Algorithm 1. The metric calculates the variance associated with neurons’ synaptic weights by measuring the average distance between each observation and its corresponding
BMU, i.e.,

The next step is determining the level of similarity among
neurons. We have performed different validity measures to
divide neurons at the postsynaptic layer into clusters where
inter-cluster similarities are minimized while the intracluster similarities are maximized. Let 𝐶 = {𝐶1 , 𝐶2 , ..., 𝐶𝑚 } be
a set 𝑚 clusters’ centroids, 𝑁 = (𝑁1 , 𝑁2 , … , 𝑁𝑘 ) be 𝑘 neurons at the postsynaptic layer and 𝜑(𝑥𝑖 , 𝑥𝑗 ) be the similarity
measure between two EDs 𝑥𝑖 and 𝑥𝑗 . |𝑁𝑖 |{𝑚} is the number
of neurons in the 𝑚th cluster. The first validity measure used
in this work, Davies-Bouldin index (DBI), operates based on
the inter-cluster and intra-cluster variance. The similarities
among all ED’s features projected into neurons are considered. Let denote the mean distance of all neurons belonging
to cluster 𝐶𝑚 to their centroid as:
𝛿𝑚 =

where 𝑘 is the size of the lattice (the number of neurons at the
postsynaptic layer) and 𝑉 𝑖 is the Voronoi areas associated
with the 𝑖th BMU (Ψ𝑖 ). Therefore, by using such a metric
for determining the convergence of the algorithm, the proper
number of neurons was detected. The learning rate of the
algorithm is a value between 0 and 1. Different initial values
for the learning rate of the algorithm were tested, and the
results are illustrated in Fig. 4. The initial learning rate has
been set to 0.57, and 270 neurons have been considered.

The number of clusters, i.e., 𝑝 in (19) which minimizes the

For the second validity metric (i.e., Silhouette index), the
within-cluster distance (Eq. 20), the mean distance among
neurons in each cluster (𝐶𝑙𝑖 ), and the intra-cluster similarity
(Eq. 21) between the cluster to which 𝑁𝑖 belongs and its
nearest cluster are calculated.

The smallest intra-cluster distance is then calculated, 𝛽(𝑖) =

𝑚≠𝑝

(𝑁𝑖 ) at the postsynaptic layer can be defined as
𝑆̌ =

𝛽(𝑖) − 𝛼(𝑖)
𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝛼(𝑖), 𝛽(𝑖))

(22)

The mean of the index defined above for a given cluster is
then calculated. Silhouette values fall between −1 and 1, and
a value close to 1 indicates that the corresponding number
of clusters is optimal. Considering the DBI measure, the average distance among clusters should be minimized. Hence,
the minimum values for this validity index are considered.
According to the results achieved from the validity measures
presented in Table 4, we choose seven as the optimal number
of clusters. The results achieved in this work show that the
algorithm converges appropriately, and the generated neural network units have been decently grouped into superclusters. Finally, the results of the clustering method are
illustrated in Fig. 5.
We have aggregated the number of confirmed COVID
cases in each Electoral Division given the identified clusters,
and the results are demonstrated in Table 5. As shown, the
number of confirmed COVID cases in Clusters 5, 6, and 7 are
higher comparing with others. Given the result of the clustering model and the visualizations in Fig. 5, we can identify
different characteristics of each cluster. The detailed features
are presented in Table 6. We have found that those clusters
with a high number of cases have the lowest proportions of
the population with age over 65, high percentage of employment, high percentage of private rent, and high percentage
of the population aged 25-44 (young professionals). At the
same time, they have the highest proportion of house shares.
The boxplots illustrated in Fig. 6 correspond to the cluster
characteristics in the seven detected clusters.

6. Conclusions and Future Work
In this work, we have proposed a multiple-level approach
to study the association between geodemographic clustering
and the number of confirmed Covid cases in Dublin, Ireland.
This work suggests that by incorporating and clustering the
publicly available census data, we can obtain valuable insights regarding the spatial variations of people who have
contracted the virus. The proposed method includes various phases. As the census data used in this work consists

Different tests have also been applied to make sure the most
relevant features are selected. Then, an advanced geodemographic clustering algorithm has been implemented based on
a self-organizing feature map to extract clusters given the selected features. The quality of the generated map has been
analyzed. It should be noted that there is no universal definition of what is good clustering, and this notion is relative.
As discussed throughout the paper, an SOM has been considered in this work due to the inherent non-linear characterPage 9 of 12

According to the analysis, we have detected seven clusters based on the census data and the spatial distribution

terms of real-life infected people attributes.
