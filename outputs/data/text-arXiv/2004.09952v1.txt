The study aimed to forecast the total earnings lost of
the tourism industry of the Philippines during the COVID19 pandemic using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average. Several models were considered based on the
autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation graphs. Based
on the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and Root Mean
Squared Error, ARIMA(1,1,1)×(1,0,1)12 was identified to be
the better model among the others with an AIC value of
−414.51 and RMSE of 47884.85. Moreover, it is expected
that the industry will have an estimated earning loss of
around P 170.5 billion pesos if the COVID-19 crisis will
continue up to July. Possible recommendations to mitigate
the problem includes stopping foreign tourism but allowing
regions for domestic travels if the regions are confirmed to
have no cases of COVID-19, assuming that every regions will
follow the stringent guidelines to eliminate or prevent transmissions; or extending this to countries with no COVID-19
cases.

1 Introduction
1.1 Background of the Study
According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, tourism
accounts to 12.7% of the countrys Gross Domestic Product
in the year 2018 [1]. Moreover, National Economic Development Authority reported that 1.5% of the countrys GDP
on 2018 is accounted to international tourism with Korea,
China and USA having the largest numbers of tourists coming in []. In addition, Department of Tourism recorded that
7.4% of the total domestic tourists or an estimated figure
of 3.97 million tourists, both foreign and domestics were in
Davao Region on 2018 [2]. Also, employment in tourism in-

dustry was roughly estimated to 5.4 million in 2018 which
constitutes 13% of the employment in the country according
to the Philippine Statistics Authority [3].
Hence, estimating the total earnings of the tourism industry in the Philippines will be very helpful in formulating
necessary interventions and strategies to mitigate the effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper will serve as a baseline research to describe and estimate the earnings lost of the
said industry.
1.2

Problem Statement
The objective of this research is to forecast the monthly
earnings loss of the tourism industry during the COVID-19
pandemic by forecasting the monthly foreign visitor arrivals
using Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average.
Specifically, it aims to answer the following questions:
1. What is the order of the seasonal autoregressive intergrated moving average for the monthly foreign visitor
arrivals in the Philippines?
2. How much earnings did the tourism industry lost during
the COVID-19 pandemic?
1.3

Scope and Limitations
The study covers a period of approximately eight years
from January 2012 to December 2019. Also, the modeling technique that was considered in this research is
limited only to autoregressive integrated moving average
(ARIMA) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving
average (SARIMA). Other modeling techniques were not
tested and considered.

2 Methodology
2.1 Research Design
The research utilized longitudinal research design
wherein the monthly foreign visitor arrivals in the Philippines is recorded and analyzed. A longitudinal research
design is an observational research method in which data
is gathered for the same subject repeatedly over a period
of time [4]. Forecasting method, specifically the Seasonal
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), was
used to forecast the future monthly foreign visitor arrivals.
In selecting the appropriate model to forecast the
monthly foreign visitor arrivals in the Philippines, the BoxJenkins methodology was used. The data set was divided into
two sets: the training set which is composed of 86 data points
from January 2012 to December 2018; and testing set which
is composed of 12 data points from January 2019 to December 2019. The training set was used to identify the appropriate SARIMA order whereas the testing set will measure
the accuracy of the selected model using root mean squared
error. The best model, in the context of this paper, was characterized to have a low Akaike’s Information Criterion and
low root mean squared error.
2.2

2. Model Estimation
In this stage, parameters are estimated by finding the
values of the model coefficients which provide the best
fit to the data. In this research, the combination of Conditional Sum of Squares and Maximum Likelihood estimates was used by the researcher. Conditional sum
of squares was utilized to find the starting values, then
maximum likelihood was applied after.
3. Diagnostic Checking
Diagnostic checking performs residual analysis. This
stage involves testing the assumptions of the model to
identify any areas where the model is inadequate and
if the corresponding residuals are uncorrelated. BoxPierce and Ljung-Box tests may be used to test the assumptions. Once the model is a good fit, it can be used
for forecasting.
4. Forecast Evaluation
Forecast evaluation involves generating forecasted
values equal to the time frame of the model validation
set then comparing these values to the latter. The root
mean squared error was used to check the accuracy of
the model. Moreover, the ACF and PACF plots were
used to check if the residuals behave like white noise
while the Shapiro-Wilk test was used to perform normality test.

Source of Data
The data were extracted from Department of Tourism
website. The data were composed of monthly foreign visitor arrivals from January 2012 to December 2019 which is
composed of 98 data points.

The following statistical tools were used in the data analysis of this study.

Procedure for Box-Jenkins Methodology
Box-Jenkins methodology refers to a systematic method
of identifying, fitting, checking, and using SARIMA time
series models. The method is appropriate for time series of
medium to long length which is at least 50 observations. The
Box-Jenkins approach is divided into three stages: Model
Identification, Model Estimation, and Diagnostic Checking.
1. Model Identification
In this stage, the first step is to check whether the data
is stationary or not. If it is not, then differencing was
applied to the data until it becomes stationary. Stationary series means that the value of the series fluctuates
around a constant mean and variance with no seasonality over time. Plotting the sample autocorrelation function (ACF) and sample partial autocorrelation function
(PACF) can be used to assess if the series is stationary
or not. Also, Augmented Dickey−Fuller (ADF) test can
be applied to check if the series is stationary or not. Next
step is to check if the variance of the series is constant
or not. If it is not, data transformation such as differencing and/or Box-Cox transformation (eg. logarithm and
square root) may be applied. Once done, the parameters
p and q are identified using the ACF and PACF.
If there are 2 or more candidate models, the Akaike’s
Information Criterion (AIC) can be used to select which
among the models is better. The model with the lowest
AIC was selected.

Data Analysis

1. Sample Autocorrelation Function
Sample autocorrelation function measures how correlated past data points are to future values, based on
how many time steps these points are separated by.
Given a time series Xt , we define the sample autocorrelation function, rk , at lag k as [5]

N−k

∑ (Xt − X̄)(Xt+k − X̄)

rk =

t=1

for k = 1, 2, ...

N

(1)

2

∑ (Xt − X̄)

t=1

where X̄ is the average of n observations .
2. Sample Partial Autocorrelation Function
Sample partial autocorrelation function measures
the correlation between two points that are separated by
some number of periods but with the effect of the intervening correlations removed in the series. Given a
time series Xt , the partial autocorrelation of lag k is the
autocorrelation between Xt and Xt+k with the linear dependence of Xt on Xt+1 through Xt+k−1 removed. The

sample partial autocorrelation function is defined as [5]
h−1

rk − ∑ φk−1, j rk− j
φkk =

j=1

6. Conditional Sum of Squares
Conditional sum of squares was utilized to find
the starting values in estimating the parameters of the
SARIMA process. The formula is given by [7]

(2)

j−1

θ̂n = arg min sn (θ)

1 − ∑ φk−1, j r j

(5)

θ∈

j=1

where φk, j = φk−1, j − φk,k φk−1,k− j , for j = 1, 2, ..., k − 1,
and rk is the sample autocorrelation at lag k.
3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
RMSE is a frequently used measure of the difference between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed from the environment that is being
modelled. These individual differences are also called
residuals, and the RMSE serves to aggregate them into
a single measure of predictive power. The RMSE of a
model prediction with respect to the estimated variable
Xmodel is defined as the square root of the mean squared
error [6]
s
1 n
RMSE =
∑ (ŷi − yi )2
n i=1
where ŷi is the predicted values, yi is the actual value,
and n is the number of observations.
4. Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC)
The AIC is a measure of how well a model fits a
dataset, penalizing models that are so flexible that they
would also fit unrelated datasets just as well. The general form for calculating the AIC is [5]
AIC p,q =

−2 ln(maximized likelihood) + 2r
n

(3)

where n is the sample size, r = p + q + 1 is the number
of estimated parameters, and including a constant term.
5. Ljung−Box Q* Test
The Ljung−Box statistic, also called the modified
Box-Pierce statistic, is a function of the accumulated
sample autocorrelation, r j , up to any specified time lag
m. This statistic is used to test whether the residuals of
a series of observations over time are random and independent. The null hypothesis is that the model does not
exhibit lack of fit and the alternative hypothesis is the
model exhibits lack of fit. The test statistic is defined
as [5]
r̂k2
k=1 n − k
m

Q∗ = n(n + 2) ∑

(4)

where r̂k2 is the estimated autocorrelation of the series
at lag k, m is the number of lags being tested, n is the
sample size, and the given statistic is approximately Chi
Square distributed with h degrees of freedom, where h =
m − p − q.

t−1
1 n 2
et (θ) , et (θ) = ∑ α j (θ)xt− j , and
∑
n t=1
j=0
⊂ R p is a compact set.
7. Maximum Likelihood
According to [7], once the model order has been
identified, maximum likelihood was used to estimate the
parameters c, φ1 , ..., φ p , θ1 , ..., θq . This method finds the
values of the parameters which maximize the probability
of getting the data that has been observed . For SARIMA
models, the process is very similar to the least squares
estimates that would be obtained by minimizing

where sn (θ) =

T

∑ εt2

(6)

t=1

where εt is the error term.
8. Box−Cox Transformation
Box−Cox Transformation is applied to stabilize the
variance of a time series. It is a family of transformations that includes logarithms and power transformation
which depend on the parameter λ and are defined as follows [8]
 λ
 yi − 1
(λ)
, if λ 6= 0
yi =
 λ
ln yi
, if λ = 0
(
λ
y
, if λ 6= 0
wi = i
ln yi , if λ = 0
where yi is the original time series values, wi is the transformed time series values using Box-Cox, and λ is the
parameter for the transformation.
2.5

Statistical Software
R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing [9].
R includes linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification modeling, clustering, etc. The ‘forecast’ package [7] was utilized to generate time series plots, autocorrelation function/partial autocorrelation function plots, and forecasting. Also, the ‘tseries’
package [10] was used to perform Augmented Dickey-Fuller
(ADF) to test stationarity. Moreover, the ‘lmtest’ package
[11] was used to test the parameters of the SARIMA model.
Finally, the ‘ggplot2’ [12], ‘tidyr’ [13], and ‘dplyr’ [14] were
used to plot time series data considered during the conduct
of the research.

Results and Discussion

3.1

How much Foreign Tourism Earnings was Lost during the COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis

Fig. 2: Expected Monthly Earnings Loss
Fig. 1: Monthly Foreign Visitor Arrivals

Line plot was used to describe the behavior of the
monthly foreign visitor arrivals in the Philippines. Figure 1
shows that there is an increasing trend and a seasonality pattern in the time series. Specifically, there is a seasonal increase in monthly foreign visitor arrivals every December
and a seasonal decrease every September. These patterns
suggest a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) approach in modeling and forecasting the
monthly foreign visitor arrivals in the Philippines.

Figure 2 shows the estimated earnings loss (in billion pesos) of the tourism industry of the Philippines every month
from April 2020 to December 2020. According to the Department of Tourism, the Average Daily Expenditure (ADE)
for the month in review is P 8,423.98 and the Average
Length of Stay (ALoS) of tourists in the country is recorded
at 7.11 nights. The figures were generated by multiplying the
forecasted monthly foreign visitor arrivals, ADE, and ALoS
(rounded to 7) [2]. Moreover, it is forecasted under community quarantine that the recovery time will take around four to
five months (up to July) [15]. With this, the estimated earning loss of the country in terms of tourism will be around
170.5 billion pesos.

Akaike Information Criterion and Root Mean Squared
Error were used to identify which model was used to model
and forecast the monthly foreign visitor arrivals in the Philippines. Table 1 shows the top two SARIMA models based on
AIC generated using R. ARIMA (1,1,1)×(1,0,1)12 has the
lowest AIC with a value of −414.56 which is followed by
ARIMA (1,1,1)×(1,0,1)12 with an AIC value of −414.51.
Model estimation was performed on both models and generated significant parameters for both models (refer to Appendix A.2). Moreover, diagnostic checking was performed
to assess the model. Both models passed the checks using
residual versus time plot, residual versus fitted plot, normal
Q-Q plot, ACF graph, PACF graphs, Ljung-Box test, and
Shapiro-Wilk test (refer to Appendix A.3). Finally, forecast evaluation was performed to measure the accuracy of
the model using an out-of-sample data set (refer to Appendix
A.4). ARIMA (1,1,1)×(1,0,1)12 produced the lowest RMSE
relative to ARIMA (0,1,2)×(1,0,1)12 . Hence, the former was
used to forecast the monthly foreign visitor arrivals in the
Philippines.

4 Conclusions and Recommendations
4.1 Conclusions
Based on the results presented on the study, the following findings were drawn:
1. The order of SARIMA model used to forecast
the monthly foreign visitor arrival is ARIMA
(1,1,1)×(1,0,1)12 since it produced a relatively
low AIC of −414.51 and the lowest RMSE of 47884.85
using an out-of-sample data. This means that the
model is relatively better among other SARIMA models
considered in forecasting the monthly foreign visitor
arrivals in the Philippines.
2. If the COVID-19 Pandemic lasts up to five months, the
tourism industry of the Philippines will have an estimated earnings loss of about P 170.5 billion. Assumptions about average daily expenditure and average length
of stay of tourists were based on the Department of
Tourism reports.
4.2

Recommendations
The projected P 170.5 billion loss on Philippines foreign tourism is really a huge money. Regaining such loss
the soonest time, however, would only jeopardize the lives
of the Filipino people. On the other hand, the government

can, perhaps, reopen the Philippines domestic tourism. This
would somehow help regain the countrys loss on revenue
from tourism, although not fully.
However, the following recommendations, shown in
scenarios/options below, may be helpful in regaining it, both
in foreign and domestic tourism, and ensuring safety among
Filipinos, as well.
1. Option 1: Stop foreign tourism until the availability of
the vaccine, but gradually open domestic tourism starting July of 2020. In this scenario/option, the following
considerations may be adhered to, viz.
(a) not all domestic tourism shall be reopened in the
entire country; only those areas with zero covid19 cases;
(b) for areas where domestic tourism is allowed/reopened, appropriate guidelines should
be strictly implemented by concerned departments/agencies to eliminate/prevent covid-19
transmission; and
(c) digital code that would help in tracing the contacts
and whereabouts of domestic tourists, as being
used in China and Singapore, should be installed
before the reopening of the domestic tourism.
2. Option 2: Gradual opening of foreign tourism starting
July 2020 and full reopening of domestic tourism on the
first semester of 2021 or when the covid-19 cases in the
Philippines is already zero. However, the following considerations should be satisfied, viz.

Fig. 3: Line, ACF, and PACF Plot of Monthly Visitor Arrivals

Line, ACF, and PACF graph were used to identify the
model to be used to forecast the monthly visitor arrivals in
the Philippines. The line graph in Figure 3 shows an increasing trend which suggests a non-stationary behavior. This is
supported by the ACF and PACF plots which shows a slow
decay in all the lags of the former and the the first lag is significant for the latter. Moreover, the line plot slightly display
an increasing variance across time. Therefore, data transformation such as differencing and Box-Cox transform were
applied to the time series data.

Model Estimation
The combination of conditional sum of squares and
maximum likelihood estimates were used to estimate the parameters of the three moving averages and test its significance. Table 3 shows the estimated coefficients, standard
errors, z-values, and p-values of each parameters of ARIMA
(0,1,2)×(1,0,1)12 . Since the p-value of the parameter is less
than 0.05, there is sufficient evidence to say that the estimate
of the moving averages, seasonal autoregressive, and seasonal moving average are significantly different from zero.

Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) was used to identify the best SARIMA model from among the models considered. Table 2 shows the top 2 models with the least AIC,
namely: ARIMA (0,1,2)×(1,0,1)12 (Model 1) and ARIMA
(1,1,1)×(1,0,1)12 (Model 2)with an AIC of −414.56 and
−414.51, respectively.

Diagnostic Checking
Residual versus Time, Residual versus Fitted, and Normal Q-Q Plot were used to perform diagnostic checking for
the model whereas ACF and PACF plots of the residuals were
used to check if there are remaining patterns that should be
accounted by the model 1 and 2. Graphs for Model 1 are displayed in the left whereas graphs for Model 2 are displayed
in the right. Figure 5 shows that the residuals and time does
not display correlation between the two variables. Therefore,
this scatter plot suggests that the residuals has no serial correlation, that is, there is no interdependence between time and
residuals. This is supported by Ljung-Box test which suggests that the error terms behave randomly for both Model
1 (Q(20) = 20.109, df=20, Model df=4, p= 0.4511) and
Model 2 (Q(20) = 20.941, df=20, Model df=4, p= 0.4006).
In addition, the residuals versus fitted values scatter plot displays no visible funneling pattern which indicates that the
variances of the error term are relatively equal. Moreover,
the normal Q-Q plot suggests that the residuals are normally
distributed since most of the the values lie along a line. This
is supported by Shapiro-Wilk test which suggest that the error is normally distributed for both Model 1 (W= 0.98062,
p= 0.2372) and Model 2 (W= 0.9852, p= 0.4513). Finally,

cast errors are normally distributed. Moreover, root mean
squared error was used to identify which model has better
forecast accuracy. The results show that Model 2 has the
lowest RMSE which means that Model 2 is relatively accurate compared to Model 1.
Based on the diagnostic presented, the models satisfied
all the assumptions of a seasonal autoregressive integrated
moving average model. Furthermore, Model 2 is relatively
accurate compared to Model 1 based on the RMSE of each
model. Hence, the ARIMA (1,1,1)×(1,0,1)12 was used to
forecast the monthly visitor arrivals in the Philippines.
Fig. 5: Line, ACF, and PACF Plot of the Two Models

ACF and PACF graphs displays that all of the lags are within
the acceptable limits. Therefore, all the lags are not significant which means that the residuals of the model may be
considered as white noise. Hence, the residuals are assumed
to be Guassian white noise.
A.4

Forecast Evaluation
Figure 6 shows the ACF and PACF graphs of the forecast
errors both models. All of the autocorrelation and partial
autocorrelation are within the limits which means that these
values are not significant. Therefore, the forecast errors are
considered white noise.
Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test if the forecast errors of both models were normally distributed. The results show that there is no sufficient evidence to say that
the forecast error terms are not normally distributed for both
Model 1 (W= 0.0.878, p= 0.082) and Model 2 (W= 0.875,
p= 0.075). This means that it can be assumed that the fore-
