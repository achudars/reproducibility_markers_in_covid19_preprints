Abstract
A new epidemic model for Covid-19 has been constructed and simulated for eight US states. The coefficients for this model, based on
seven coupled differential equations, are carefully evaluated against
recorded data on cases and deaths. These projections reveal that
Covid-19 will become endemic, spreading for more than two years. If
stay-at-home orders are relaxed, most states may experience a secondary peak in 2021. The number of Covid-19 deaths could have
been significantly lower in most states that opened up, if lockdowns
had been maintained. Additionally, our model predicts that decreasing contact rate by 10%, or increasing testing by approximately 15%,
or doubling lockdown compliance (from the current ‚àº 15%) will eradicate infections in Texas within a year. Applied to the entire US, the
predictions based on the current situation indicate about 11 million
total infections (including undetected), 8 million cumulative confirmed
cases, and 630,000 cumulative deaths by November 1, 2020.

The first cases of community Covid-19 transmission in the United States
were reported in California, Oregon, Washington state, and New York state
in late February, 2020 ‚Äì roughly two months after the initial outbreak in
Wuhan, China [1]. A national emergency was declared by the US President
on March 13, 2020, and testing several days later revealed that Covid-19 had
spread to all 50 states. On March 20, New York City was declared the US
outbreak epicenter [1]. As of June 29, 2020, the US had approximately 2.5
million confirmed Covid-19 cases and 125,000 confirmed deaths [2]; we note
that Florida, Arizona, and Texas are now emerging outbreak epicenters. It
is natural to ask how the situation will look in a few months, and even in
a few years, based on the recent trend of rapidly rising cases in several US
states, and also to ask what interventions need to be ramped up in order to
prevent further spread.

Figure 1: A new epidemiological compartment model for Covid-19. Each
compartment reflects a category of the population, with rates of transfer between compartments indicated by the arrows. Œ≤U a is the infection rate, q(t)
is the sequestration rate,  is the exclusion rate due to undetected recovery
or death, Œ¥ is the detection rate, Œ± is the detected recovery rate, Œ≥ is the detected death rate, and œÅ is the reintroduction rate (due to loss of immunity as
reinfection is quite likely, particularly for Covid-19 [3] ‚Äì either due to intrinsic
loss of antibody effectiveness or due to the virus having metamorphosed).
We propose a new compartmental, epidemiological, dynamical systems
model (see [4]) to predict Covid-19 virus growth. It considers: both detected
2

and undetected infected populations, medical quarantine and social sequestration, release from sequestration, plus possible reinfection due to loss of
immunity. The model considers the population to be conceptually separated
into mutually exclusive compartments or subgroups: susceptible (which is
the majority of the population at the beginning of an outbreak), undetected
infecteds (who presumably avoid detection due to having mild or no symptoms), excluded (due to undetected recovery or deaths), quarantine (not representative of an enforced medical quarantine ‚Äì which is already accounted
for by the detected infected compartment ‚Äì but rather self-sequestration),
detected infected (detected due to testing), detected recovered, and detected
deaths. Individuals are transferred between compartments at distinct rates,
as shown in Figure 1, where the rates are determined by fitting to reliable
and verified data on case counts and deaths. For our study, the data was
obtained from the Johns Hopkins University‚Äôs GitHub website repository [5].
Sheltering-at-home, as some states have ordered, and release from this, since
some states have reopened, are modeled by having a time dependent sequestration rate q(t) with two peaks centered on the days these measures impacted
each state ‚Äì the days and the magnitude of the peaks (corresponding to the
fraction of the population transferred) are also fit parameters.
Note that the essential process behind our study is simple. First we write
a set of seven coupled ordinary differential equations, some nonlinear, for the
compartment content level; these equations contain a series of coefficients,
one is time-dependent, which denote the transfer rates between the compartments. These coefficients are evaluated by fitting the model equations
to data, and then the evolutionary solutions of the equations for the compartment levels can be simply calculated using a computer. Sensitivity to
these coefficients can be explored by altering their values and studying the
solutions.
As is usual with modeling complex phenomena such as Covid-19, a major
challenge is to focus on the most important aspects of the phenomenon by
undertaking judicious simplifications. Hence, in our study, several simplifying assumptions or idealizations have been made. We assume that detected
infected individuals do not transmit Covid-19 to the susceptible population
during medical or self-isolation. Our contact rate Œ≤, and therefore the infectious power Œ≤U a (see Figure 1), is modeled as being constant in time ‚Äì
in future versions of our model we may incorporate time dependent Œ≤ or a
in order to disentangle population wide transmission suppression (e.g. face
masks) from social contact suppression (stay-at-home orders). Our q(t) func3

tion removes susceptibles and undetetected infecteds at the same rate (we
have no reason at this time to differentiate the rates of change of these populations). Similarly, people from the excluded and recovered compartments
lose immunity at the same rate œÅ. Indeed, it is possible that people who
experienced milder forms of the disease (excluded) lose immunity faster than
those who experienced more severe and persistent symptoms and sought out
treatment (recovered); this is not unexpected because severe illness is quite
likely to induce higher levels of antibodies [3]; however, we use a single rate
for simplicity. Finally, we do not consider the effects of births, vertical transmissions (from mother to child during pregnancy), immigrants, emigrants,
or deaths due to other diseases or trauma.
The coefficients in the model, including contact rate Œ≤, U (0) at the beginning of the outbreak (time 0), a, and detection Œ¥, recovery Œ±, sequestration
and reintroduction (into the susceptible class) q(t) rates, are evaluated by
fitting to empirical case and death data for eight major US states: Arizona,
California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York State, and
Texas ‚Äì see figure 2. Together, these states make up 43% of the US population; some of these states appear to have handled their initial outbreaks well,
while others appear to be emerging hotspots. The evolution of Covid-19 is
fairly similar among these states: variations in contact and recovery rates remain below 5%; however, variations are larger in death rate, reinfection rate,
sequestration rate, and release rate from sequestration. Surprisingly, we find
that the sequestration rate is low, less than 20%, in all states considered.
The release rate from sequestration is rather high in some states ‚Äì around
50% in Arizona and Florida, and nearly 40% in Texas, explaining the current
dire situation of rapidly rising case counts.
Extending our model based on the current situation out to two years, we
find that Covid-19 will become endemic, spreading for more than two years,
with the peak number of cases occurring for most states in the Autumn
months ‚Äì see Figure 3 (gray dashed curve). Had lockdowns been continued
at the prior compliance rate, the number of cases would have been one tenth,
and death rates up to five times lower. Fitting our model to all of the US
states and generating predictions based on the current situation, we find that
there will be about 11 million total infections (including undetected), 8 million cumulative confirmed cases, and 630,000 cumulative deaths by November
1, 2020.
Considering that some states are planning for a phased reopening, with
further access to businesses and entertainment venues in the coming months,
4

we examined the effects of fully reopening all of the states considered on two
dates ‚Äì September 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021 ‚Äì see Figure 3. For fully
reopening on both of these dates, we observe a similar trend ‚Äì the number
of infections rapidly rise, leading to peaks in infections within two months of
reopening ‚Äì similar to what is currently occurring in Arizona, Florida, and
Texas. We also observe that many states experience a smaller, second peak
in infections within six months of the first peak. This demonstrates that
reopening states should not occur unless additional interventions to reduce
the infectiousness of the disease and its spread are implemented.
Based on the current situation in Texas, we tested the effects of interventions on Covid-19 prevalence. We found that decreasing the contact rate by
only 10% results in eradication of the disease within one year. Such an increase is easily achievable by people in the absence of formal statewide orders
simply by wearing masks and increasing social distancing. Increasing detection by testing by 15% also results in eliminating Covid-19 within a year, as
does doubling the current compliance with staying at home (from the current
15% to 30%). These findings are somewhat surprising and suggest that it is
indeed possible to eliminate the virus, which will otherwise remain endemic.
