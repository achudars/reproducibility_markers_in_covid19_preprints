Abstract
As the recent COVID-19 outbreak rapidly expands all over the world, various
containment measures have been carried out to fight against the COVID-19
pandemic. In Mainland China, the containment measures consist of three types,
i.e., Wuhan travel ban, intra-city quarantine and isolation, and inter-city travel
restriction. In order to carry out the measures, local economy and information
acquisition play an important role. In this paper, we investigate the correlation of
local economy and the information acquisition on the execution of containment
measures to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Mainland China. First, we
use a parsimonious model, i.e., SIR-X model, to estimate the parameters, which
represent the execution of intra-city quarantine and isolation in major cities of
Mainland China. In order to understand the execution of intra-city quarantine and
isolation, we analyze the correlation between the representative parameters
including local economy, mobility, and information acquisition. To this end, we
collect the data of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the inflows from Wuhan and
outflows, and the COVID-19 related search frequency from a widely-used Web
mapping service, i.e., Baidu Maps, and Web search engine, i.e., Baidu Search
Engine, in Mainland China. Based on the analysis, we confirm the strong
correlation between the local economy and the execution of information acquisition
in major cities of Mainland China. We further evidence that, although the cities
with high GDP per capita attracts bigger inflows from Wuhan, people are more
likely to conduct the quarantine measure and to reduce going out to other cities.
Finally, the correlation analysis using search data shows that well-informed
individuals are likely to carry out containment measures.

Introduction

Since December 2019, novel coronavirus COVID-19 has been identified and the outbreak
has expanded rapidly throughout tremendous countries, e.g., China [1], United
States [2], European countries [3], etc. In China, the number of confirmed cases
increased from 571 on January 23, 2020 to 84,388 on May 1, 2020 and saturated around
84.5 thousand. The COVID-19 has become a global emergency and is currently
spreading throughout the whole world [4, 5]. In order to deal with the rapid outbreak of
the COVID-19 pandemic in Mainland China, a range of containment measures have
been put in place by Chinese authorities [6–8]. Similar containment measures have been
adopted in major countries all over the world [9, 10] etc.
In Mainland China, the containment measures consist of intra-city and inter-city
measures. As intra-city measures, suspected and confirmed cases have been quarantined
in hospitals or monitored self-quarantine at home [11], which is denoted the “quarantine”

measure in the paper. The authorities also encouraged citizens to stay-at-home and
discouraged mass gatherings closed schools [12]. In addition, Wuhan city travel ban was
adopted, i.e., all transport was prohibited in and out of Wuhan city from 10:00 a.m. on
23 January 2020, which incurred a significant reduction of the outflows from Wuhan as
shown in 1. As shown in Figure 2, the national spring vacation has been prolonged and
inter-city travel has been discouraged to reduce massive human migration across cities
in order to reduce infection.

Mobile applications, e.g., Baidu Migration 1 and search engines, e.g., Baidu 2 , can be
easily used to achieve information acquisition for citizens to keep informed during the
outbreak of COVID-19. There are a great number of studies [1, 13–19] that
demonstrated the feasibility to leverage mobile applications for information acquisition.
As a result, the history search records can reflect the information acquisition status and
the history statistical migration data can be used to analyze the status of the
COVID-19 outbreak. As well-informed individuals are likely to travel less when there is
COVID-19 [20], it is interesting to analyze the correlation between information
acquisition and the execution of the containment measures. In addition, the correlation

between the local economy and the information acquisition can be used to reveal how
people in different economy situations react to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this work, we aim at using a parsimonious model, i.e., SIR-X model, and Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [21] methods to estimate the parameters of the execution
of intra-city containment measures in major cities of Mainland China. Then, we analyze
the correlation among different random variables, i.e., information acquisition status
(COVID-19-related search frequency), local economy situation (GDP per capita) and
the parameters in the SIR-X model, in order to understand the relationship among
economy, information acquisition and the execution of containment measures. More
specifically, we would like to investigate following problems:

• How to construct a model to capture the confirmed cases? This research issue has
been studied [7, 11] at province scale using the migration scale index released by
Baidu Migration Open Data, where the index is calculated based on the past
historical statistical records from a widely-used Web mapping service, i.e., Baidu
Maps 3 . We propose to construct an SIR-X model based on the confirmed cases at
city scale using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We provide solid
results using exact figures for major Chinese cities.
• To what degree does the local economy affect the pandemic outbreaks of COVID-19
and the execution of containment measures in major cities of China? The impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on economy has been studied [22, 23] while the
correlations between local economy and the outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic
or the execution of containment measures are not analyzed. We hypothesized that
the outflows from Wuhan trend to go to the cities where GDP per capital is high.
We further hypothesized that there would be more initial confirmed cases as more
infected people arrived at these cities. In addition, we hypothesized that the
people in the cities where GDP per capital is high tend to perform more
information acquisition activities through voluntary COVID-19-related search in
order to be well informed on the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyze
the correlations based on the estimated parameters of SIR-X and the statistical
data from Baidu Maps and provide solid results for major Chinese cities.

• To what degree does the information acquisition affect the execution of
containment measures in major cities of China? Strong positive correlation
between the pandemic outbreaks of COVID-19 the information acquisition has
been reported in [20] while the correlation between the information acquisition
and the execution of containment measures are not analyzed. As reported in [20]
and was seen in the collective responses to the emergencies [24] and panics [13],
people voluntarily acquire information more frequently when the pandemic
situations become worse in their cities. We hypothesized the well-informed people
tend to apply the containment measures more strictly in order to avoid the risk to
be infected and the risk to make the situation worse. We analyze this correlation
based on the estimated parameters of SIR-X and the statistical data from Baidu
Maps and Baidu Search Engine, and provide solid results for major Chinese cities
as well.
Different from existing research [1, 6, 7, 11], we particularly analyze the correlation
between local economy strength and the COVID-19-related search frequency with the
city population size (a controlling variable) removed in order to avoid the impact of the
scale of city. Compared to the existing work [20, 22], we analyze the correlations not
only based on the data from Baidu Maps and Baidu Search Engine but also based on
the combination of an SIR-X model and MCMC methods.

Modeling epidemic spread with containment
measures

In this section, we first present the existing models to capture COVID-19. Then, we
propose using SIR-X and MCMC to construct the model. Afterwards, we present the
comparison between the official number and the model fitting number of accumulated
confirmed cases.
Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model [25, 26] and Susceptible Exposed
Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model [27–29] are largely adopted to characterize the
outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. However, the containment measures cannot be
described in the standard SIR or SEIR model. A modified SEIR model [30] is proposed
with the consideration of mobility while it is still not able to infer the execution of
containment measures. A Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) [30] model is proposed to
project the number of accumulated confirmed cases, which is not able to describe the
execution of containment measures either.
In order to characterize the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic with containment
measures at city level, we exploit the SIR-X model [11]. The SIR-X model is a modified
SIR model, which takes the containment measures into consideration. We have the same
assumptions and use the same representative parameters as those in [11]. We assume
that there are public containment efforts, e.g., stay-at-home, reduced interaction with
other people, which is referred as ‘containment’ and represented by a variable κ0 . In
addition, we assume that infected individuals are quarantined, which is referred as
‘quarantine’ and represented by a variable κ. We use α to represent the infection speed
of an infected individual and β −1 to represent the average time an infected individual
remains infectious before recovery or removal. Then, the SIR-X model is expressed by
the following differential equations:
∂t S = −αSI − κ0 S
∂t I = αSI − βI − κ0 I − κI
∂t R = βI + κ0 S

(1)

∂t X = (κ + κ0 )I

Instead of fixing the same parameters (α and β) for each province in [11], we
estimated the parameters using a MCMC [21] method, inspired by [31]. In the model,
I0 represents the number of initial infected individuals. The basic reproduction number
R0 represents the average number of secondary infections an infected will cause before
he or she recovers or is removed [11]. The reproduction number can be calculated as:
α
R0 =
. We use R0,f ree to represent the reproduction number without
β + κ + κ0
containment or quarantine measures. As high temperature and high humidity
significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19 citeWang2020, R0,f ree and β may be
different for different cities because of the diversity of local environments. Thus, we use
the MCMC [21] method to estimate the distribution of the parameters, i.e., α, β, κ, κ0 ,
I0 , while the other parameters are fixed (S0 is the population in the city, R00 is fixed as
0 and X0 is the number of initial confirmed cases) at the beginning (January 23, 2020)
with S0 , R00 , X0 and I0 representing the initial values of S, I, R and X.

Specifically, we use the uniform distribution as the parameter’s prior distribution.
And with the consideration of the nonlinear of SIR-X model, we adopt the Sequential
Monte Carlo sampler to achieve the posterior distribution of model’s parameters
including the α and β. Finally, we take the expected value of each parameter to
construct the model.

In order to have stable results from the MCMC method, we use a priori conditions,
0
i.e., R0 < R0,f
ree and κ0 < κ. The results of MCMC methods may not be stable, i.e.,
the results of each execution may be different without a priori conditions. Thus, we
0
introduce a priori conditions, i.e., R0 < R0,f
ree , κ0 < κ and the model fit number of
accumulated confirmed cases should be equal or bigger than the official number of
0
0
confirmed cases. R0,f
ree represents a maximum value of R0 . We set R0,f ree as 6.2,
which is in accordance with the result from [11] that the R0 should be between 1.4 and
3.3. During the fitting process, if the a priori conditions are not met, the fitting process
will be executed again until reaching a limit, e.g., 20 times of execution, in order to
avoid infinite execution. We assume that the quarantine measure is applied more
strictly on the infected individuals than other public citizens, i.e., κ0 < κ.
In order to use the SIR-X model, we need to assume that few travelers and
symptomatic infected individuals travel into or from a city. As reported in [20], there is
strong correlation between the inflows from Wuhan and the confirmed cases in a city.
We assume that few infected individuals travelled into major cities after January 23,
2020 as Wuhan travel ban has been put in place since January 23, 2020 and few people
went to other cities from Wuhan as shown in Figure 1. In addition, we assume that the
number of infected individuals in the inflows from other cities can be ignored compared
to the number of infected individuals among the local citizens in a city. With these two
assumptions, we can use the SIR-X and MCMC to estimate parameters for each major
cities in Mainland China based on the number of confirmed cases 4 from January 23,
2020 to May 1, 2020.
Figures 3a - 3f illustrate the confirmed cases in several major cities of Mainland
China. From figures, we can see that the combination of SIR-X and MCMC captures the
number of confirmed cases in different cities very well, e.g., Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen,
Wuhan and Chongqing. However, the model does not well characterize the number of
confirmed cases in Guangzhou as there are many (127 5 ) infected individuals from other
countries, which cannot be captured by the SIR-X model. In addition, we believe that
the errors between the confirmed cases and fitted data are mainly due to the travelers
from other countries in Beijing (174 confirmed cases from other countries) and Shanghai
(326 confirmed cases from other countries). Then, we calculate the confirmed cases of
different provinces by adding the number of confirmed cases in each affiliated city.
Figures 4a - 4f shows the number of confirmed cases in several provinces of Mainland
China. We can see that the SIR-X well captures the aggregated cases at province scale.
Furthermore, we use the same method to calculate the number of confirmed cases in
Mainland China as shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows that the combination of SIR-X
model and MCMC captures well the number of confirmed cases at city scale.

Correlation study

Besides the number of confirmed cases (May 1, 2020), we collected three datasets, i.e.,
GDP, mobility and COVID-19-related search frequency for major cities in Mainland
China. The GDP dataset was collected from [32], which characterized local economic
development in 2019. The mobility data was captured from Baidu Maps and the
COVID-19-related search frequency (the ratio between COVID-19-related search volume
from January to March 2020 and population in each city) data was gathered from a
widely-used Web search engine. We analyze the correlation among local economy,
mobility, search behaviors and the parameters estimated based on the combination of
the SIR-X model and the MCMC method as presented in Section 2, for 238 cities in

Significant positive correlations have been evidenced
between local economy and COVID-19-related search
frequency

We have evidenced the significant positive correlations between local economy and
COVID-19-related search frequency for major Chinese cities (Result I in Table 1). In
order to analyze the correlation between two random variables, we calculated the
Pearson correlation coefficients [33] and conducted the Student’s T-test (two tails) to
verify the significance test (the same for the following analysis in the paper). The
Pearson correlation between the local GDP per capita and the total COVID-19-related
search volume (between January and March 2020) is R∗∗∗ = 52.5% (N = 238 and
p-value= 3.06 × 10−18 < 0.0001) for each city. However, we considered that this

observation can be incurred by the scale of the city, as a larger city would have larger
population, and would correspond to bigger GDP and high COVI-19-related search
volume.
We therefore tested the significance of the correlations between GDP per capita and
COVID-19-related search frequency, where we evidenced the significance in the
correlations as R∗∗∗ = 63.5% (N = 238 and p-value=2.91 × 10−28 < 0.0001). In
addition, in order to obviate the impact of the scale of the city, i.e., the impact of city
population, we conducted partial correlation analysis [34, 35] between GDP per capita
and the COVID-19-related search frequency with the effects of the city population size
(a controlling variable) removed. In order to estimate the partial correlation of random

We find a strong correlation with significance as well, such that R∗∗∗ = 57.0% (N = 238
and p-value= 7.15 × 10−22 < 0.0001). Thus, we can conclude that no matter whether
the scale of the city is big or small, the GDP per capita has a significant positive
correlation with the COVID-19-related search frequency. Please see also in Figure 8 for
the visualization of the correlations.

Correlation analysis for the spread of the COVID-19
pandemic

We have evidenced the significant positive correlation between the GDP per capita and
inflows from Wuhan (Result II in Table 1). We hypothesized that cities with higher
GDP per capita would attract larger inflows from Wuhan. Therefore, for every city in
the study, we correlated the GDP per capita and the inflows from Wuhan, where we
obtained Pearson correlation coefficients of R∗∗∗ = 42.3% (N = 238 and
p-value= 9.88 × 10−12 < 0.0001). In addition, in order to obviate the impact of the scale
of the city, we correlated GDP per capita and the inflows rate from Wuhan, i.e., the
ratio between inflows from Wuhan and the population. We found a strong positive
correlation with significance as well, such that R∗∗∗ = 32.6% (N = 238 and
p-value= 2.67 × 10−7 < 0.0001). Please see also in Figures 9 and 10 for the visualization
of the correlations.

have more initial infected cases, i.e., I0 in the SIR-X model. Thus, we correlated the
inflows from Wuhan and I0 , where we obtained found a strong positive correlation with
significance, such that R∗∗ = 21.6% (N = 238 and p-value= 8.11 × 10−4 < 0.001). In
addition, we analyzed the correlation between the inflow rate and R0 , where we found a
strong positive correlation with significance, such that R∗ = 19.2% (N = 238 and

We have evidenced the significance of the positive correlation between the number of
initial infected individuals and the number of confirmed cases (Result II in Table 1) and
the positive correlation between R0 and the number of confirmed case rate (Result III in
Table 1). We hypothesized that cities with bigger I0 finally have more confirmed cases.
To this end, we performed correlation using I0 and the number of confirmed cases on
May 1, 2020. We found a significant positive correlation, such that R∗∗ = 22.5% with
N = 238 and p-value= 4.67 × 10−4 < 0.001. In addition, we hypothesized that cities
with bigger R0 have more confirmed case rate, i.e., the ratio between the confirmed
cases and the population. We performed correlation between R0 and the confirmed case
rate, where we obtained a significant positive correlation, such that R∗∗∗ = 29.8% with
N = 238 and p-value= 2.82 × 10−6 < 0.0001. Please see also in Figures 13 and 14 for

(N = 238 and p-value= 2.45 × 10−11 < 0.0001). Furthermore, we obtained a strong
positive correlation with significance between confirmed case rate and the
COVID-19-related search frequency, such that R∗∗ = 21.4% (N = 238 and
p-value= 9.01 × 10−4 < 0.001). Similar results are also reported in [20].
We thus can conclude that for each major city in the study, the GDP per capita and
the factors that incur infections, e.g., inflows from Wuhan, I0 , R0 , have significant
positive correlation. This indicates that the rich cities attract more inflows from Wuhan,
which caused infections and in order to fight against COVID-19, the citizens in the rich
cities tend to perform more search activities in order to be well-informed.

Correlation analysis for the execution of containment
measures

In this section, we analyze the correlation among local economy, information acquisition
and containment measures. As the quarantine measure (see details in Section 2) is
directly related to the number of confirmed cases, we analyze the correlation between κ
and other factors (local economy and information acquisition). In addition, we are also
interested in the realization of inter-city containment measures, i.e., the outflow recovery
rate (the ratio between the outflows of 2020 and that of 2019).

We have evidenced the significance of the positive correlation between the execution
of the quarantine measure and GDP per capita for major Chinese cities in the study
(Result IV in Table 1). Among all 238 cities in the correlation study, we hypothesized
that people with high GDP per capita would try harder to realize the quarantine
measure for infected individuals. Therefore, we correlated the GDP per capita and κ,
where Pearson correlation coefficients are R∗ = 17.3% (N = 238 and
p-value= 7.46 × 10−3 < 0.01). Furthermore, we correlated the GDP per capita and the
outflow recovery rate, where we obtained Pearson correlation coefficients of

R∗∗∗ = −46.5% (N = 238 and p-value= 3.82 × 10−14 < 0.0001). The correlation
analysis result suggests that people with higher GDP per capita are more likely to apply
the quarantine measure. Please see also in Figures 15 and 16 for the visualization of the
correlations.
We have evidenced the significance of the positive correlations between the realization
of quarantine measure and the COVID-19-related search frequency. We performed
correlation using the COVID-19-related search frequency and κ. We found a significant
positive correlation, such that R∗ = 17.8% with N = 238 and
p-value= 5.84 × 10−3 < 0.01. Please see also in Figures 17 for the visualization of the
correlations. We found negative correlations between the COVID-19-related search
frequency and the outflow recovery rate are stronger with R∗∗∗ = −51.4% (N = 238
and p-value= 1.88 × 10−17 < 0.0001) (similar result is also reported in [20]). The
correlation analysis result suggests that people with more per capita COVID-19-related
search frequency are more likely to apply the containment measures, i.e., separate the
infected individuals and small outflow recovery rate.
We can conclude that for every city in the study the GDP per capita and the
COVID-19-related search frequency have significant positive correlation to the
realization of containment measures. We believe it is due to the will to avoid the risk to
be infected and the natural response to the fear and massive panics [13, 20]. In addition,
the reason also goes to the fact that the people in the cities of higher GDP per capita
tend to have bigger capacity or more tolerance to apply the containment measures.

Conclusion

In this work, we first exploit the SIR-X model and MCMC method to estimate the
parameters related to the COVID-19 pandemic at the scale of city. Then, we examined
the correlation between the local economy and the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and
the execution of containment measures in major cities of Mainland China. We
conducted correlation analysis based on the mobility data and search data from Baidu
Maps and Baidu Search Engine in Mainland China. Our analysis brings novel
knowledge of the correlation among different factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The cities of higher GDP per capita attracts bigger inflows from Wuhan, which cause
more confirmed cases. However, the demands of information from individuals becomes
higher, which incurs the reaction to apply the containment measures. Furthermore,
well-informed individuals are more likely to apply the intra- and inter- city containment
measures, i.e., quarantine of infected individuals and reducing going to other cities. The
implications of these correlations include that, the better the local economy is and the
more that timely information acquisition is attained by residents, the better the
containment measures are realized, which help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in
major cities of Mainland China.
