The SIR-compartment model is among the simplest models that describe the spread of a disease
through a population. The model makes the unrealistic assumption that the population through
which the disease is spreading is well-mixed. Although real populations have heterogeneities in
contacts not represented in the SIR model, it nevertheless well fits real US state Covid-19 case data.
Here we demonstrate mathematically how closely the simple continuous SIR model approximates
a model which includes heterogeneous contacts, and provide insight onto how one can interpret
parameters gleaned from regression in the context of heterogeneous dynamics.

Differences in susceptibility and rates of contact between individuals strongly affect their likelihood of catching Covid-19. High contact rates may explain why outbreaks have been particularly devastating for prisons [4],
nursing homes [5], and cruise ships [6], while variations in
susceptibility between students, families and caretakers,
and school staff vastly complicate modeling of the conditions needed to reopen schools during the epidemic.
Heterogeneities also strongly influence the thresholds for
herd immunity [7].
However, heterogeneity-capturing models contain
many unknown parameters that are difficult to fit to real
data. Accordingly, public health departments continue
to make predictions about the progress of the epidemic
and about the effectiveness of social distancing based on
so-called well-mixed models (reviewed in [8]), and these
models can be made to fit existing case data very well.
To show the general applicability of well-mixed models, we first sought to determine how closely the number
of cumulative cases in different US states from the beginning of their respective outbreaks to May 20th, by which
time stay at home orders had been relaxed, changing the
transmission rate of the disease [9], can be modeled by the
SIR model. Solutions of SIR models with different initial
conditions and populations are mathematically similar
when rescaled by the population size and translated in
time[8]. Accordingly, we tested whether cumulative cases
for many different states could be collapsed onto a single master curve if the number of cases was scaled by
an appropriately chosen population size, and the curves
shifted in time to account for the different arrival times
of index cases in each state. Even though the 52 states
and territories have different heterogeneous compositions
based on their age-demography, urban-rural subpopulations, and other factors, the state Covid curves could be
clustered into just 7 different clusters of curves (Fig. 1
and Supplementary Materials).
We then modeled the master curves for each state using a well-mixed SIR-model [10]. In the model, a group
of susceptibles (S ) transition via contact with infectious
individuals to the infectious (I ) group, and after some
time recover or are removed (R). The three compart-

ments evolve according to:
dS

(1)

while dR
dt = γI ensures that the total number of individuals S + I + R = Ntot remains constant. The susceptibility coefficient β represents the number of infections
caused by a single infected individual in an otherwise
susceptible population in unit time. γ is a basic recovery
rate. For the above equations to be valid the population
should be well-mixed: everyone in the population interacts with everyone else at all times. Given geographic
considerations and changes in mixing behavior during
a pandemic, this assumption cannot be true. Accordingly, much modern epidemiological modeling, including
of Covid-19 [8, 11, 12], has focused on the role of heterogeneous contacts, either by ramifying compartments
or by using networks to model connections between individuals [7, 13–21]. Previous work has shown that under
certain conditions heterogeneous models by well-mixed
models [22–24], but there is limited data showing these
conditions are met by real epidemics.
The SIR model fits the US state data for 6 of the 7 clusters, accounting for 37 of 52 states and territories (Fig.
1). The remaining data fit well at larger case numbers,
when the data are less likely to be influenced by stochastic effects [25]. Given its neglect of heterogeneities in
population contacts, why does the basic SIR differential
equation fit pandemic data so well?
A Heterogeneous Extension.—To examine why the
simple SIR model fits real pandemic data at all, we consider a multi-population SIR model that allows for populations to be heterogeneous in their contacts and susceptibilities. The model assumes that the population is
split into K subpopulations, with population sizes Ni ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , K, that interact with each other with contact rate βij , i.e. βij is the number of infections a single
infected individual in subpopulation i could cause in subpopulation j, if j contains only susceptible individuals.
Our subpopulations represent geographic or demographic
partitions of Ntot . In this first treatment we neglect differences in recovery rate based on individual characteristics. The susceptible, infectious, and removed quantities

fectively merging into a single homogeneous population.
Scaling βij Nj ensures that interactions between subpopulations are proportionate to their sizes.
A single SIR model fits this model for b & 0.2 (Fig
2). Moreover, the β̃ gathered by Eq. 3 is very close to
the β achieved by least squares model fitting to the full
simulation, although unsurprisingly least squares fitting
performs better at fitting the actual curve for lower values of b. The agreement between β̃ and the fitted β is
encouraging: for the consideration of real data, one can
only deduce model parameters via some sort of fitting
algorithm without knowledge of subcompartmental dynamics, but the result suggests that least squares fitting
optimally estimates the susceptibility parameter to maximize the simple SIR part of the model relative to the
intrapopulation dynamics.
A Model with Network Structure.—We now model subpopulations whose interactions are prescribed by a network with adjacency matrix Aij . Aij = 1 indicates two
subpopulations that maintain frequent contact with one
another, such as a pair of communities which go to the
same grocery store or school. For the purpose of analysis, we modeled random connections between subpopulations as random Erdős-Réyni networks parameterized
by mean degree. The SIR model approximates the graph
dynamics model above b = 0.2, with the fit improving
as the mean degree of each node is increased (Fig. 3).
However, β̃ does not asymptote to β = 0.2 whether we
use Eqn. 3 or least squares fitting. Instead, increasing
mixing allows the model to gain awareness of how sparse
the connections between subpopulations are, ultimately
causing β̃ to decrease. When all subpopulations have the
same size:

Both numerator and denominator include a term which
relies on graph structure and gains weight with the mixing parameter b and the covariance between the fraction of susceptibles and infecteds across subpopulations.
Just as for a complete graph, β̃ agrees with β from least
squares fits. Narrowing of error bars as mean degree of
the random network increases express the decreasing importance of network structure as the mean degree of the
network increases.
Connections to other macroscopic spread estimators.—
We have shown that one can generate a single populationlevel transmission rate for a heterogeneous population.
From β we may derive the basic reproduction number
R0 = β/γ, the expected number of secondary cases produced in a completely susceptible population, by a typical
infectious individual[26]. We compare the results from
Eq.3 with basic exponential growth rate fitting on the
first 20 days of the simulation and the next-generation
matrix method from [3] (Fig. 4).
In [3], R0 is computed for a general compartment
model from the Jacobian matrix of the system. This
matrix is evaluated at a disease-free equilibrium to determine the average number of individuals that a typical
infectious person infects when the population is asymptotically disease free, i.e. Si = Ni for each i. Applying
the method in [3] to Eq. 4 and making the assumption
that Ni = Nj for all i and j as in the simulations, we
obtain:

1 + ρ(Aij )
R0 =

K
where ρ denotes the spectral radius of the matrix Aij . In
the complete network case (as in Fig. 2), ρ(Aij ) = K − 1,
which yields R0 = β/γ, matching the asymptote in Fig.
4.
As the mean degree of our random network increases,
R0 values computed from the next generation matrix
method in [3] and the R0 computed from β̃ in Fig. 4
converge. The exponential growth rate consistently underestimates the contact rate, while, for small values of
b, the next generation matrix method R0 exceeds the optimal estimate from β̃.
The R0 computed in [3] comes from the linearized
dynamics—it provides a threshold for the stability of
disease-free equilibria (see [27]). By contrast the R0 computed in this paper is computed by approximating the
spread of the disease by a homogeneous model. Surprisingly, the two methods produce confluent results even
under modest levels of mixing between subpopulations.

lations can exhibit well-mixed dynamics that can be described by an SIR model. Importantly, the optimal susceptibility parameter is 1. obtainable from least squares
fitting, and 2. interpretible in terms of intrapopulation
dynamics.
Our analysis of data from states and territories provide empirical evidence that there is enough mixing between the disease hotspots within each state or territory
that approximation by a well-mixed model is appropriate.
The concordance between β obtained by curve fitting and
Eqn. 3 affirms that least squares fitting extracts information on the subpopulation interaction structure and dynamical asymmetry between subpopulations. Although
our analysis of state data is restricted to the duration
of stay at home orders, our framework allows for timevarying contact structures: for example a step function
β can fit state data beyond May 20th [25].
Although we have examined what a simple susceptibility parameter could mean in the context of model fitting, two large questions remain. First Our state models
are built up of well-mixed subpopulations; we make no
assertion about whether these subpopulations represent
households, neighborhoods, cities, or counties. Indeed,
an important corollary of our analysis is that with even
modest levels of connectedness between the subpopulations they can function as well-mixed, making the details of the substructure undetectable in the data. Second, state case data can be aligned by scaling population sizes, but the population sizes used for rescaling are
unconnected to the state’s real population. Since even
loosely connected networks of subpopulations have closeto-well mixed dynamics, our results suggest that state
populations must be divided into disconnected networks,
and the effective Ntot for a state measures the size of
its disease-carrying networks. Whether these networks
are truly disconnected, or the disease has a second phase
of spread between networks is key to predicting its long
term spread.
