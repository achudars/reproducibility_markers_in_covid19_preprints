Abstract
This paper analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on the populations and equity
markets of 92 countries. We compare country-by-country equity market dynamics
to cumulative COVID-19 case and death counts and new case trajectories.
First, we examine the multivariate time series of cumulative cases and deaths,
particularly regarding their changing structure over time. We reveal similarities
between the case and death time series, and key dates that the structure of the
time series changed. Next, we classify new case time series, demonstrate five
characteristic classes of trajectories, and quantify discrepancy between them
with respect to the behavior of waves of the disease. Finally, we show there is
no relationship between countries’ equity market performance and their success
in managing COVID-19. Each country’s equity index has been unresponsive to
the domestic or global state of the pandemic. Instead, these indices have been
highly uniform, with most movement in March.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 has had an immense social and economic impact on countries
around the world, claiming many lives, necessitating business closures, and
sending financial markets into disarray. This paper addresses the following
question: on a country-by-country basis, what has had the most impact on a
country’s stock market - its total cumulative cases, the growth in new daily
cases, the return of second waves of the disease, or the worldwide state of the
pandemic? The goal of this paper is to study the worldwide spread of COVID-19,
analyze the various waves of the disease on a country-by-country basis, and show
that the financial markets have been unresponsive to all developments in new or
cumulative cases after March.

The pandemic has prompted a substantial amount of attention and research.
Epidemiologists have analyzed the spread of COVID-19 and potential measures
of containment [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], while clinical researchers have explored potential
treatments for the disease [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In finance, many studies have
observed the impact of COVID-19 on stock markets [14, 15, 16], particularly
regarding financial contagion [17, 18] and stability [19]. Within the nonlinear
dynamics community, a majority of papers on COVID-19 have used new and
traditional techniques to analyze and predict the spread of cases and deaths
[20, 21, 22, 23]. Of these, improvements to SIR models [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]
and power-law models [31, 32, 33, 34] have been the most popular. There is an
absence of research that studies financial markets in conjunction with the spread
of the virus.
For this goal, we use new and existing time series analysis techniques. Existing
methods of time series analysis are diverse, including power-law models [35, 36,
37, 38, 31], and nonparametric methods such as distance analysis [39], distance
correlation [40, 41, 42] and network models [43, 44]. Time series analysis has
been widely applied to both finance [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50] and epidemiology
[51, 52], including COVID-19 [32, 53, 23].
We implement two methods of clustering time series, which have been previously used in various financial [54, 55, 56] and epidemiological applications,
including inflammatory diseases [57], airborne diseases [58], Alzheimer’s disease
[59], Ebola [60], SARS [61], and COVID-19 [53]. The two methods we use are
hierarchical clustering [62, 63] and the optimal one-dimensional implementation
of K-means, Ckmeans.1d.dp [64].
In each of the proceeding three sections, we implement time series analysis
and clustering for a different goal. In Section 2, we use a smoothed dynamic
implementation of cluster analysis to track the worldwide spread of COVID-19,
particularly the change in structure over time. In Section 3, we apply semi-metrics
to sets of turning points to classify countries according to the disease’s first,
second or third wave behavior. In Section 4, we use a new method to analyze case
trajectories and equity markets in conjunction, and show the markets are highly
concurrent with each other, not any country’s case counts. Section 5 summarizes
our findings regarding the considerably different progression of COVID-19 and
equity market trends of 2020.
2. Cumulative COVID-19 case and death spread
In this section, we use a dynamic and smoothed implementation of cluster
analysis to study the worldwide spread of COVID-19, track the relationships
between countries’ cumulative case and death counts, and detect changes in the
structure of the two time series. Our data spans 12/31/2019 to 08/31/2020, a
period of T = 245 days. We restrict attention to countries with more than 10
000 cumulative cases at the end of the data period, leaving n = 92 countries.
We order these countries by alphabetical order and let xi (t), yi (t) ∈ R be the
multivariate time series of cumulative daily cases and deaths, respectively, for
i = 1, ..., n and t = 1, ..., T .
2

2.1. Cluster-based methodology for multivariate time series
Following [23], this analysis proceeds in several steps, which are further
explained in Appendix A. First, given the multivariate time series of cases or
deaths, we generate a logarithmic distance matrix D(t) between counts xi (t)
(t)
at time t. That is, D(t) is an n × n matrix with entries Dij = | log(xi (t)) −
log(xj (t))|. Next, we estimate an appropriate number of clusters to partition the
counts x1 (t), ..., xn (t) at each time t. We average over several methods from the
statistical learning literature [65] to produce an estimator kav (t), and then apply
exponential smoothing to produce a smoothed integer value k̂(t). Third, we use
the distance matrix D(t) to partition the counts into k̂(t) clusters at each t. As
our data is one-dimensional, we apply the optimal implementation of K-means
specific to one-dimensional data, Ckmeans.1d.dp [64].
We record the results of this day-by-day clustering in several ways. Figure 1
displays the changing cluster memberships in the form of heat maps. Figure 2a
plots the smoothed number of clusters k̂(t) for both cases and deaths. We define
two sequences of n × n adjacency matrices and affinity matrices defined by
(

.

(2)

To understand the changing cluster structure of the series with time, we define
1
a distance between these adjacency
Pn matrices. Let the L norm of an n × n
matrix A be defined as ||A|| = i,j=1 |aij |. Given s, t ∈ [1, ..., T ], let d(s, t) =
||Adj(t) −Adj(s) ||. This distance measures the discrepancy between the respective
cluster structure on different days. We perform hierarchical clustering on d(s, t)
in Figure 3.
Finally, we can use the constructions so far to compare the case and death
time series in conjunction. Turning first to the number of clusters, let k̂X (t), k̂Y (t)
be the smoothed number for cases and deaths, respectively. Noticing a similarity
between these functions, we can compute the most appropriate offset between
them. Given a function f (t) and δ > 0, we write fδ (t) = f (t + δ). An appropriate
offset can be computed by minimizing the L1 norm between functions,
Z
1
||(k̂X )δ − k̂Y ||L = |k̂X (t + δ) − k̂Y (t)|dt.
(3)
Turning to the cluster structure, we can define and compute the offset that
minimizes the discrepancy between adjacency or affinity matrices AffX and AffY
of the two time series. With τ > 0, we seek to minimize the normalized difference

Figure 1: Heat maps track the changing cluster membership of select countries with respect to
(a) cases and (b) deaths, respectively. Cluster membership depicts COVID-19 severity relative
to the rest of the world. Clusters are labelled and ordered with 1 being the worst impacted at
any time. Darker colors signify worse affected clusters.

We display this normalized difference as a function of τ in Figure 2b and observe
a clear minimum. This can be computed for both adjacency and affinity matrices.
2.2. Results of cluster-based analysis of cases and deaths
We now summarize the results of the three figures. Figure 1a tracks the
changing cluster membership of 15 select countries with respect to their case
counts from February onwards, and captures the natural history of COVID-19.
China was the first country to experience a severe number of cases, and was the
unique country in the worst-affected cluster until late March. Then, Italy, Spain
and the United States (US) join the worst-affected cluster, struggling to contain
their case counts. From the beginning of April until the end of May, the US was
the unique member of the worst-affected cluster, signifying how exceptionally it
was impacted by COVID-19 cases relative to every other country. Brazil joins
the worst-affected cluster at the start of June, and India at the start of August.
By contrast, the United Kingdom (UK), Italy, Spain and Germany move to less
affected clusters from the beginning of April, likely a result of strict lockdown
procedures implemented in these countries.
Figure 1b tracks the cluster memberships according to deaths for the same
countries. Until mid-March, China was the only member of the worst-affected
cluster. From then until mid-May, the US, UK, Spain, and Italy belong to
the worst-affected cluster. Subsequently, the UK, Spain and Italy leave this
cluster. As with cases, the US was the unique member of the worst cluster with
respect to deaths for over a month, with Brazil joining at the end of June, and
India joining just before the end of August. Given the similarity in case and
death cluster behaviors, anomalous countries can be identified if they belong
to a significantly different case and death cluster at the same time. The most
anomalous country is Singapore. On 08/31/2020, Singapore belonged to the
fifth case cluster, but the ninth and least severe death cluster. Indeed, on this

day, Singapore had 56771 cases and only 27 deaths, a lower death rate than
any other country under consideration. In general, these heat maps have two
advantages over other methodologies: first, they are an effective tool for visually
comparing the severity of one country’s counts relative to the rest of the world.
Next, they can highlight countries that are in significantly different clusters with
respect to cases and deaths, such as Singapore.
Figure 2a tracks the changing number of clusters for both cases and deaths.
During February and March, the number of clusters rises substantially as the
virus spreads to different countries at different rates. Subsequently, cluster
numbers stabilize in April, May and June, then begin to decline as cumulative
counts around the world begin to exhibit more homogeneity. Toward the end
of the period, the greater number of case clusters than death clusters reflects
the greater heterogeneity in death rates than cumulative cases. Singapore is
the starkest example here, but this difference reveals a general trend that the
time series for deaths become more spread out than the time series for cases.
The minimal offset in the number of clusters is computed to be δ = 27. Figure
2b displays a convex minimum of τ = 15 for the offset that minimizes the
discrepancy between affinity matrices pertaining to the case and death time
series. With respect to adjacency matrices, this offset is τ = 20.
Figure 3 studies the evolution of the cluster structure over time via hierarchical clustering on the distance between adjacency matrices on different dates.
Accounting for the 15-day offset identified in Figure 2b, we focus our attention
on date ranges 05/01 - 08/31 in Figure 3a for cases and 05/16 - 08/31 in Figure
3b for deaths. Each dendrogram identifies four clusters of date ranges, with
broad similarity between the figures. All clusters are identified as contiguous
intervals of dates: 05/01-05/29, 05/30-07/01, 07/02-08/07, and 08/08-08/31
for cases; 05/16-06/12, 06/13-07/20, 07/21-08/17, and 08/18-08/31 for deaths.
Thus, Figure 3a reveals marked transitions in the cluster structure on three
dates: 05/30, 07/02, and 08/08, while Figure 3b reveals transitions on 06/13,

The three boundary dates 05/30, 07/02, 08/08 for cases and 06/13, 07/21, 08/18 for deaths
herald significant changes in the structure of the multivariate time series on these dates.

07/21, and 08/18. The fact that all clusters are unbroken intervals means the
transition dates between the adjacency matrices characterize significant changes
in the cluster structure of the respective time series. In Figure 3, we plot only
the intervals of dates rather than all 123 individual dates, for sake of readability
of the labels. This methodology reveals significant changes in a collection of
time series without the use of change point detection algorithms [66]. Change
point algorithms often require highly tuned parameters for good results, are
usually applied in a univariate setting, and typically require the assumption of
independence [67].
3. New case trajectories and wave behavior
In this section, we study the trajectories of new cases. Again we restrict to
the n = 92 countries with more than 10 000 total recorded cases as of 08/31/2020.
Our goal is to algorithmically identify turning points in new case counts on a
country-by-country basis and therefore determine which countries are in their
first, second, or later waves of the disease. We also apply a measure of discrepancy
between sets of turning points to compare this behavior between countries.
Following [68], we proceed in several steps, which are further detailed in
Appendix B. Let zi (t) ∈ R be the time series of new daily cases, with countries
ordered alphabetically. First, we apply a Savitzky-Golay filter to produce a
collection of smoothed time series ẑi (t), t = 1, ..., T and i = 1, ..., n. Next, we
apply a two-step algorithm where we select and then refine a set of turning
points. We assign to each smoothed time series a non-empty set Pi and Ti of
local maxima (peaks) and local minima (troughs). Every sequence of turning
points begins with a trough at t = 1, where there are zero cases, and alternates
between trough and peak. These sequences determine if a given country is in a
first or second wave of COVID-19. An assigned sequence of TP indicates the
country is in its first wave, with case counts that have never materially decreased;
a sequence of TPTP indicates a country is in its second wave. A sequence of
TPT indicates a country experienced one wave followed by a period of significant
decline. If this trough occurs as the last day of the period, the cases are still in
decline; if it occurs before the last day, the wave has reached a local minimum
and is completely over.
Finally, we measure distance between two sets of turning points using the
semi-metrics between finite sets proposed in [69]. Given two non-empty finite
sets A, B, this is defined as
P
P

d(a, B)
1
b∈B d(b, A)
D(A, B) =
+ a∈A
.
(5)
2
|B|
|A|
The semi-metric D(A, B) is symmetric, non-negative, and zero if and only if
A = B. Then, we define the n × n turning point distance matrix DT P by
TP
Dij
= D(Pi , Pj ) + D(Ti , Tj ).

(6)

Our algorithmic approach classifies the 92 countries under consideration into
five characteristic classes. 15 countries, including Brazil, India and Argentina,
displayed in Figures 4a, 4b, 4c, respectively, are assigned the sequence TP and
determined to be in their first wave of the disease. 31 countries, including China
(4d), Sweden (4e) and Russia (4f) are assigned the sequence TPT, indicating
these countries experienced one wave of the disease - their counts have either
reached a local minimum or are still in decline. 28 countries, including Spain (4g),
Italy (4h), the UK (4i) and Germany (4j) are assigned TPTP and determined
to be in the midst of their second wave. 14 countries, including the United
States (4k) and Singapore (4l) are assigned TPTPT, indicating an ongoing or
completed decline from a second wave. Notably, the United States was in a
rapid decline in new cases as of 08/31/2020, but still a substantial number of
∼ 40000, while Singapore’s cases declined to nearly zero. Finally, 4 countries,
that is, Portugal, Greece, Croatia and South Korea are determined to be in
their third wave. Of the 92 countries analyzed, 24 exhibited their greatest case
counts up to smoothing on the final day of the period. Of the 46 countries that
experienced a second (or third) wave, their final wave was more severe for 28 of
them. A complete classification of the 92 countries is included in Appendix C.
Figure 5 displays hierarchical clustering on the 92 × 92 matrix DT P . China
is an outlier due to turning points that occurred much earlier than any other
country, and relatively little activity in the disease after March. Excluding China,
four primary clusters are revealed in this dendrogram, corresponding to differing
behaviors of waves of the disease. The semi-metric in Equation (5) prioritizes
low minimal distances between sets, rather than the number of elements. Thus,
the four countries in their third wave are assigned to the same cluster as the
second wave countries due to low minimal distances between their turning point
sets. Compared to other methodologies, the matrix DT P is capable of quickly
classifying countries into first, second or higher wave behaviors. This paper is
the first time it has been used to examine different countries’ COVID-19 counts.
4. Equity Market Dynamics
In this section, we study the dynamics of 17 countries’ equity indices with
respect to both pricing and 30-day rolling volatility. The data spans 01/01/2020
to 08/31/2020, a period of T1 = 175 trading days. The countries analyzed are:
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy,
Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the UK and the US.
This list contains the top 15 economies in the world by nominal GDP [70], and at
least one country from each of the five characteristic classes of behavior identified
in Section 3.
Let pi (t) be the multivariate time series of each country’s daily closing equity
prices, for t = 1, ..., T1 and i = 1, ..., 17. Let σi (t) be the 30-day rolling volatility,
t = 1, ..., T1 − 30. For each t, this is defined √
as the standard deviation of the
previous 30 days of index data, normalized by 250, the number of trading days
in a year. This measure of volatility is one of several that we could potentially
consider. For example, [71] study the impact of COVID-19 on cryptocurrencies

clusters of time series are identified with the following behaviors: 15 countries in their first
wave, 31 countries declining from their first wave, 14 countries declining from their second
wave, and a final cluster containing 28 countries currently in their second wave and 4 in their
third.

with a specific analysis of the max-min and absolute return volatility time
series. We plot all 17 countries’ equity prices and rolling volatility in Figure 6,
respectively, with equity prices normalized to 1 as of the start of the year. Every
index experiences a significant drop and a highly volatile period in March. At
the end of the period, China’s index has risen the most relative to its value at
the beginning of 2020. Qualitatively, we make two striking observations: first,
market dynamics have been highly uniform among the 17 countries, with China
as the only exception. Secondly, market movement after March has been largely
unaffected by the natural history of COVID-19 described in Sections 2 and 3,
such as Brazil and India entering the worst-affected clusters for cases and deaths
by the end of August, or the United States experiencing a large second wave in
July, or many other developments.
We proceed to quantify and further elucidate both of these observations. First,
we analyze all trajectories of equity prices and rolling volatilities in conjunction.

Considering
PT1 equity prices of 1a single country gives a function pi ∈ R . Let
||pi || = t=1 |pi (t)| be its L norm. We can define a normalized index price

trajectory by gi = ||p
. Analogously, we define ||σi || = t=1
|σi (t)| and

the normalized volatility trajectory by vi = ||σσii || . These vectors highlight the
relative changes of price or volatility within the entire period. We then define
P

two trajectory distance matrices, Dij
= ||gi − gj || and Dij
= ||vi − vj ||.
P
vol
We analyze these distance matrices D and D , which are symmetric, real
matrices with trace 0. As such, they can be diagonalized with real eigenvalues.
To determine self-similarity within these indices with respect to prices and rolling
volatility, we plot the absolute values of the eigenvalues |λ1 | ≤ ... ≤ |λ17 | for
each respective matrix in Figure 7. Inspecting the collective similarity of Figure
6, we expect that a large number K of the 17 countries are highly similar with
respect to equity price and rolling volatility, with a small number of outliers.
Indeed, one would expect many volatility trajectories to behave similarly due
to structural financial market factors such as volatility clustering. We examine

11

the eigenvalues to estimate this K. If there is a large collection of highly similar
elements in an n × n distance matrix D, the matrix would have the form

where rows r1 , . . . , rK are highly similar to one another and elements ∗ are close
to zero. Such a matrix is a small deformation away from a rank n − (K − 1)
matrix, and so K − 1 of the eigenvalues should be close to 0.
Thus, given an appropriate threshold , if |λ1 | ≤ ... ≤ |λK−1 | ≤ , then we
can deduce K indices are similar with respect to price or volatility. This is a
concise measure of the number of indices that are similar within the collection
studied. In Figure 7a, we can set  = 0.2 and observe that 15 eigenvalues are less
than this threshold, suggesting high similarity among 16 of the index prices, with
China as the clear outlier. In Figure 7b, 14 eigenvalues are under a threshold
of  = 0.3, suggesting broad similarity among 15 of the indices with respect to
volatility. Returning to Figure 6, this broad similarity is even more striking
when examining the significant changes over time in market behavior.
Further, the eigenvalue analysis provides a measure of the scale of the matrix.
Since the distance matrices D are symmetric, they can be conjugated by an
orthogonal matrix to yield a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. As a consequence,
the operator norm [72] of D coincides with the largest eigenvalue |λn |. That is,
||Dx||
= ||D||op = |λn |.

We can see from Figure 7 that the operator norm for Dvol is approximately
four times that of DP . Both distance trajectory matrices are normalized, so a
direct comparison is appropriate. Similarly, when comparing L2 matrix norms,
||Dvol ||2 = 4.14, while ||DP ||2 = 1.09. That is, there is a higher degree of
collective similarity among indices with respect to price trajectories than volatility.
This is a surprising result, given the expected similarity in collective volatility
behavior due to volatility clustering. This result may differ if we were to compare
price and volatility trajectories of assets in different financial sectors.
Finally, we quantify the extent to which large changes in index price coincide
with high case counts. For this purpose, we take all 17 equity price time series
pi (t) and the corresponding countries’ new case time series zi (t) ∈ R≥0 . Large

values of zi (t) mean that the disease is spreading rapidly in that country.
 On the

other hand, large values of the absolute value log returns |Ri (t)| = log pip(t−1)
indicate significant changes in the value of the market. Since equity data is only
applicable on weekdays, we restrict the new case time series to the weekdays to
yield a time series wi (t), t = 1, ..., T1 . As new cases are lower on the weekends,
this provides a good representation of the trajectory of new cases in each country.
We define a symmetric 34 × 34 matrix M that compares the concurrence of
these changes. The entries of M are normalized inner products between time
series to measure the extent of overlap between market movement and new cases.

The pairing < ., . >n is a normalized inner product that measures the concurrence
of large changes in the time series more accurately than the correlation between
price and new case time series. The matrix M is defined as follows:


< |Ri (t)|, |Rj (t)| >n if 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 17,

(11)


< |Ri (t)|, wj−17 (t) >n if 1 ≤ i ≤ 17, 18 ≤ j ≤ 34.
As all the sequences |Ri (t)|, wj (t) are non-negative, all entries of M are non13

negative. In general, given non-negative functions f, g, < f, g >n = 1 if and only
if f = αg for some α > 0, while < f, g >n = 0 if and only if the non-zero values
of f and g are disjoint sets.
In Figure 8 we perform hierarchical clustering on the matrix M and reveal
several insights. First, China is highly anomalous with respect to both case
counts and its index. Indeed, China recorded a large number of cases only during
January and February, with few cases since and no subsequent wave. Second,
China is also relatively anomalous with respect to its index. We can see two
particular periods in Figure 6 where China did not undergo similar large changes
as other countries. In March, China’s index experienced a less severe drawdown
than every other country; in July, China experienced a period of significant
positive growth, unlike any other country.
Third, the dendrogram reveals a high level of similarity among equity indices,
excluding China’s, visible in the clear subcluster in the center of the dendrogram.
These 16 equity indices form a submatrix in which the mean of all the entries
is 0.78, indicating high concurrence of large price movements. Turning to
the remaining indices, the dendrogram reveals more heterogeneity, yet some
similarity, between the same 16 countries’ case counts. While the 16 equity
indices form one prominent subcluster, the same countries’ case counts split
into two subclusters. The normalized inner product produces high association
between countries whose peaks in cases occurred at similar times. Indeed, the
first cluster generally experienced much earlier peaks, as can be seen for Italy
(4h) and Germany (4j), while the second cluster experienced large case counts
much later, such as Brazil (4a), India (4b) and Argentina (4c). Even within the
two subclusters, there is less similarity between case counts than there is for
indices. This is reflected in the tree of Figure 8, where branches belonging to
countries’ equity indices are split much lower in the tree’s structure.
Most significantly, the figure reveals that there is no concurrence at all between
large changes in countries’ case counts and their equity indices. Excluding China’s
index, all other equity indices have moved together closely - even China itself
exhibited some similarity with other indices.
The insights provided by Figure 8 are enhanced by the specific methodology
presented above. For example, we trialed the commonly used Pearson correlation
and distance correlation [40] measures between time series. The correlation does
not perform as well due to the considerable flatness of the China cases time
series, and does not identify it as an outlier. In addition, using correlation does
not split the 16 countries (other than China) into two subclusters as described
above. The distance correlation is not suitable in this setting: two time series xt
and yt with any linear relationship, such as xt = ayt + b, are determined to have
maximal distance correlation 1. This is not desired if a is negative, meaning that
xt increases or decreases in the opposite direction of yt . As such, using distance
correlation performs even more poorly, for instance allocating Canada and the
UK to their own cluster and several other poor results.

Figure 8: Hierarchical clustering on the normalized inner product matrix M . High similarity
is observed between 16 equity indices, with no relationship to case counts. China is observed
as an outlier in both cases and index. Other countries’ case counts split into two subclusters
according to whether large counts of new cases occur disproportionately early or later.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we analyze the natural history of COVID-19 across the world
in conjunction with the stock market activity of 17 countries. Qualitatively and
quantitatively we demonstrate that market movements have been highly uniform
between these 17 countries, with China as the only exception.
In Section 2, we analyze the structure of the multivariate time series of
COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our analysis isolates the US as the unique member
of the worst-affected cluster with respect to both cumulative cases and deaths
for over a month, reflecting its exceptional impact by COVID-19. Subsequently,
Brazil and India join that cluster, as their counts rose rapidly. The dendrograms
in Figure 3 each exhibit four contiguous intervals of dates, allowing us to observe
key dates when the structure of the world’s case counts changed substantially.
With respect to cases, these dates are 05/30, 07/02, and 08/08. Indeed, all these
dates herald significant shifts in the status of the disease around the world. On
05/30, Russia and Brazil enter the worst-affected cluster, on the same day as the
latter reported a record number of cases [73]. On 07/02, several countries that
had been heavily impacted earlier, such as China, South Korea, Singapore, and
the Netherlands, enter less-affected clusters. This follows from June, a period of
steady decline in Europe [74]. On 08/08, both Singapore and the Netherlands
move back into more severely affected clusters. Also around this time, India,
Brazil, much of Africa and South America experience significantly more cases
[75], while cases in Europe demonstrate a slower increase.
In Section 3, we identify five characteristic behaviors of new case trajectories
between countries. 24 countries exhibit their greatest counts up to smoothing
on the final day of the period. 46 countries experience a second wave, with 28

15

experiencing a more severe second wave than the first. Singapore and Australia
responded quickly to the virus [76], and South Korea was hailed for its early
contact tracing success [77], yet all three of these countries experience second
waves, and South Korea exhibits its greatest case counts at the end of the
period. Italy and Spain were acknowledged to have imposed lockdowns too late
in March [78], with case counts eventually declining in May. Nonetheless, both
of these countries experience second waves, with Spain’s more severe than its
first. Overall, long first waves and the return of second waves contribute to high
case counts toward the end of the data period.
Despite the substantial activity in COVID-19 cases after March, the heterogeneity of subsequent waves and the number of countries with peaks in new cases,
no discernible impact on financial indices was observed from March. In Section
4, we apply a new method to analyze collective equity market dynamics across
17 countries in conjunction with their new case counts. Eigenvalue analysis
indicates high similarity between 16 countries’ equity prices, with China as the
only outlier. We introduce an inner product pairing that demonstrates little
concurrence between the profound market movements observed in March and
development in COVID-19 cases.
Overall, we have chronicled the natural history of COVID-19 together with
the market movements during 2020. Despite substantial heterogeneity in the
new case trajectories on a country-by-country basis and frequent changes in
the order and structure of most affected countries in cumulative cases, we have
observed high homogeneity in the markets. All have moved together with
substantial drawdown in March, followed by steady recovery, and no qualitative
or quantitative relationship to any developments in COVID-19.
Our methods and results could be used by both financial practitioners and
policymakers. The identification of a single country’s index behaving differently
from the rest of the collection, in this case China’s, could provide opportunities
for diversification of holdings and portfolio gains. More broadly, studying the
sensitivity of financial securities to external factors is fundamental to market
analysts and strategists. The finding that the equity markets have been highly
uniform, despite considerably differing trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths,
may encourage policymakers to be more aggressive in pursuing containment
measures. That is, the finding that the equity indices of countries that responded
more aggressively to the pandemic have not been negatively impacted could
provide confidence in prioritizing public health with reduced concern about
harming their equity index.
Diverse future research possibilities exist with these methods. Market dynamics could be analyzed across different sectors, rather than countries. It is
conceivable that during the pandemic, equity movements may be highly homogeneous within certain sectors such as technology, but heterogeneous when
comparing retail and health care stocks. One could analyze fixed income assets
such as government and corporate bonds, and determine if there is a bifurcation
between equities and fixed income assets during market crises. Alternative asset
classes such as cryptocurrencies could be studied, building on the work of [79],
who analyze the co-movement between COVID-19 and Bitcoin. One could also
16

apply our analysis to alternative time series, such as max-min and absolute
return volatility [71, 80]. Overall, the framework presented in this paper could
be applied broadly to various economic, epidemiological and political crises.

Appendix A. Cluster-based evolution methodology
In this section, we provide more details and explanation for the methodology
described in Section 2.1. Given the exponential spread of the disease, we select
a logarithmic distance between counts. We replace any data entry that is empty
or 0 - before any cases are detected - with a 1, so that the log of that entry is
defined. Then, we define a distance on counts by d(x, y) = | log(x) − log(y)|.
Effectively, this pulls back the Euclidean metric on R by the homeomorphism
log : R+ → R and makes the positive reals a one-dimensional normed space.
This allows us to use efficient cluster methods specific to one-dimensional data.
The goal is to partition the case or death counts x1 (t), ..., xn (t) into a timevarying number of clusters at each time t. We wish to choose the number
of clusters in such a way that provides us meaningful inference on how the
multivariate time series evolves as a whole. A highly variable number of clusters
would obscure inference on individual countries’ cluster memberships. So we
combine several methods of choosing this number to reduce any bias in our
estimator and then implement exponential smoothing to yield a suitably changing
number of clusters with time. For one-dimensional data, it is often regarded as
unsuitable to use multivariate clustering methods, as simpler alternatives exist.
We use an optimal implementation of K-means clustering called Ckmeans.1dp.dp
[64]. This requires the choice of the number of clusters a priori.
To choose the number of clusters at each t, we average six methods described
in [65]. These methods are as follows: Ptbiserial index [82], Silhouette score [83],
KL index [84], C index [85], McClain-Rao index [86] and Dunn index [87], but
other methods could be used alternatively. Let the cluster numbers computed
by
P6
these methods be k1 (t), ..., k6 (t), respectively. We define kav (t) = 16 j=1 kj (t).
This value is not necessarily an integer, so we cannot cluster with it directly. The
function kav (t) is approximately locally stationary. So we may apply exponential
smoothing to produce a smoothed integer value k̂(t). It is with this number
that we cluster. Doing so at each t produces a time-varying partition of the 92
countries into clusters, and defines an adjacency matrix Adj(t) for every time t.

Appendix B. Turning point methodology
In this section, we provide more details for the identification of turning points
of a new case time series z(t). First, some smoothing of the counts is necessary
due to irregularities in the data set, and discrepancies between different data
sources. There are consistently lower counts on the weekends, and some negative
counts due to retroactive adjustments. The Savitzy-Golay filter ameliorates these
issues by combining polynomial smoothing with a moving average computation this moving average eliminates all but a few small negative counts; we simply
replace these negative counts with zero. This yields a smoothed time series
ẑ(t) ∈ R≥0 . Subsequently, we perform a two-step process to select and then refine
a non-empty set P of local maxima (peaks) and T of local minima (troughs).
Following [68], we apply a two-step algorithm to the smoothed time series
ẑ(t). The first step produces an alternating sequence of troughs and peaks,
beginning with a trough at t = 1, where there are zero cases. The second step
refines this sequence according to chosen conditions and parameters. The most
important conditions to identify a peak or trough, respectively, in the first step,
are the following:
ẑ(t0 ) = max{ẑ(t) : max(1, t0 − l) ≤ t ≤ min(t0 + l, T )},

(B.1)

ẑ(t0 ) = min{ẑ(t) : max(1, t0 − l) ≤ t ≤ min(t0 + l, T )},

(B.2)

where l is a parameter to be chosen. Following [68], we select l = 17, which
accounts for the 14-day incubation period of the virus [88] and less testing on
weekends. Defining peaks and troughs according to this definition alone has
several flaws, such as the potential for two consecutive peaks.
Instead, we implement an inductive procedure to choose an alternating
sequence of peaks and troughs. Suppose t0 is the last determined peak. We
search in the period t > t0 for the first of two cases: if we find a time t1 > t0
that satisfies (B.2) as well as a non-triviality condition ẑ(t1 ) < ẑ(t0 ), we add
t1 to the set of troughs and proceed from there. If we find a time t1 > t0 that
satisfies (B.1) and ẑ(t0 ) ≥ ẑ(t1 ), we ignore this lower peak as redundant; if we
find a time t1 > t0 that satisfies (B.1) and ẑ(t1 ) > ẑ(t0 ), we remove the peak t0 ,
replace it with t1 and continue from t1 . A similar process applies from a trough
at t0 .
At this point, the time series is assigned an alternating sequence of troughs
and peaks. However, some turning points are immaterial and should be excluded.
The second step is a flexible approach introduced in [68] for this purpose. In this
paper, we introduce new conditions within this framework. First, let tm be the
global maximum of ẑ(t). If this is not unique, we declare tm to be the first global
maximum. This time tm is always declared a peak during the first step detailed
ẑ(t1 )
above. Given any other peak t1 , we compute the peak ratio ẑ(t
. We select a
m)
ẑ(t1 )
parameter δ, and if ẑ(t
< δ, we remove the peak t1 . If two consecutive troughs
m)
t0 , t2 remain, we remove t0 if ẑ(t0 ) > ẑ(t2 ), and remove t2 if ẑ(t0 ) ≤ ẑ(t2 ). That
is, we ensure the sequence of peaks and troughs remains alternating. In our

18

implementation, we choose δ = 0.05. Unlike [68], we remove earlier peaks, not
just subsequent peaks, according to this condition.
Finally, we use the same log-gradient function between times t1 < t2 , defined
as
log-grad(t1 , t2 ) =

log ẑ(t2 ) − log ẑ(t1 )
.
t2 − t1

(B.3)

2)
The numerator equals log( ẑ(t
ẑ(t1 ) ), a "logarithmic rate of change." Unlike the
2)
standard rate of change given by ẑ(t
ẑ(t1 ) −1, the logarithmic change is symmetrically
between (−∞, ∞). Let t1 , t2 be adjacent turning points (one a trough, one a
peak). We choose a parameter  = 0.007; if

| log-grad(t1 , t2 )| < ,

(B.4)

that is, the average logarithmic change is less than 0.7%, we remove t2 from our
sets of peaks and troughs. If t2 is not the final turning point, we also remove t1 .
