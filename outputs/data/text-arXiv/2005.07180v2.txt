Abstract
We point out an instantiation of Simpson’s paradox in Covid-19 case fatality rates
(CFRs): comparing data of 44,672 cases from China with early reports from Italy
(9th March), we find that CFRs are lower in Italy for every age group, but higher
overall. This phenomenon is explained by a stark difference in case demographic
between the two countries. Using this as a motivating example, we introduce basic
concepts from mediation analysis and show how these can be used to quantify
different direct and indirect effects when assuming a coarse-grained causal graph
involving country, age, and mortality. As a case study, we then investigate total,
direct, and indirect (age-mediated) causal effects between different countries and
at different points in time. This allows us to separate age-related effects from
others unrelated to age, and thus facilitates a more transparent comparison of CFRs
across countries throughout the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Introduction

The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic originates from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the associated infectious respiratory disease Covid-19 [4]. After an outbreak was identified in Wuhan,
China, in December 2019, cases started being reported across multiple countries all over the world,
ultimately leading to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring it a pandemic on 11 March
2020 [26]. As of 3 June 2020, the pandemic led to more than 6.44 million confirmed cases and over
382,000 fatalities across 188 countries [25]. One of the most cited indicators regarding Covid-19 is
the reported case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the proportion of confirmed cases which end
fatally. In addition to the total CFR, CFRs are often also reported separately by age since CFRs differ
significantly across different age groups, with older people statistically at higher risk.
In this work, we show how tools from causal inference and, in particular, mediation analysis can be
used to interpret case and fatality data related to the Covid-19 pandemic. We motivate our investigation by pointing out what could be a textbook example of Simpson’s paradox in comparing CFRs
between China and Italy, suggesting opposite conclusions depending on whether the data is analysed
in aggregate or age-stratified form (§2). This example illustrates how a traditional statistical analysis
provides insufficient understanding of the data, and thus needs to be augmented by additional assumptions about the underlying causal relationships. In §3, we therefore postulate a coarse-grained
causal model for comparing age-specific Covid-19 CFR data across different countries. We then
review different types of (direct and indirect) causal effects, and motivate them in the context of our
assumed model as different questions about Covid-19 fatality in §4.
As one of our contributions, we curated a dataset involving 756,004 confirmed Covid-19 cases and
68,508 fatalities, separated into age groups of 10-year intervals (0–9, 10–19, etc.), reported from 11
different countries from Africa, Asia, Europe and South America and the Diamond Princess cruise
ship, which, together with an interactive notebook containing all our analyses, is publicly available

at: github.com/Juliusvk/Covid19-age-related-causal-effects. We use this dataset, in
combination with the proposed coarse-grained model, to perform a case study (§5). Tracing the
evolution of direct and indirect effects of country (China or Italy) on mortality, from early March
to late May 2020, allows to discover trends—such as a reversal in the sign of the direct effect in
mid March that temporally aligns with a reported “collapse” of the health-care system in parts of
Italy [1]—which may otherwise remain hidden in the data. Moreover, we compute direct and indirect effects for 132 pairs of countries and thus identify countries whose total CFRs are particularly
adversely affected by their case demographic. We further find that the size of indirect effects is
strongly correlated with a country’s median age, but only weakly with that of direct effects.
While our model is rather simple—and we do not claim to be the first to introduce it—it constitutes,
to the best of our knowledge, the first application of causal analysis to better understand the role of
mediators such as age in Covid-19 fatality data. We discuss limitations such as issues of selection
bias and propose future directions such as the inclusion of additional mediators in §6, and hope that
our work may serve as a stepping stone for further studies to gain better insight into the mechanisms
underlying the Covid-19 pandemic within a principled and transparent causal framework.

Simpson’s paradox in comparing CFRs between China and Italy

When comparing Covid-19 CFRs for different age groups (i.e., the proportion of confirmed Covid-19
cases within a given age group which end fatal) reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control
and Prevention [27] with preliminary CFRs from Italy as reported on March 9 by the Italian National
Institute of Health [10] a seemingly strange pattern can be observed: for all age groups, CFRs in
Italy are lower than those in China, but the total CFR in Italy is higher than that in China. This
is illustrated in Fig. 1a (see Table 1 in Appendix A for exact numbers). It constitutes a textbook
example of a statistical phenomenon known as Simpson’s paradox (or reversal) which refers to the
observation that aggregating data across subpopulations (here, age groups) may yield opposite trends
(and thus lead to reversed conclusions) from considering subpopulations separately [24].
How can such a pattern be explained? The key to understanding the phenomenon lies in the fact
that we are dealing with relative frequencies: the CFRs shown in percent in Fig. 1a are ratios and
correspond to the conditional probabilities of fatality given a case from a particular age group and
country. However, such percentages conceal the absolute numbers of cases within each age group.
Considering these absolute numbers sheds light on how the phenomenon can arise: the distribution
of cases across age groups differs significantly between the two countries, i.e., there is a statistical
association between the country of reporting and the proportion of confirmed cases per age group.
In particular, Italy recorded a much higher proportion of confirmed cases in older patients compared
to China. This is illustrated in Fig. 1b (see Table 2 in Appendix A for exact numbers).
While most cases in China fell into the age range of 30–59, the majority of cases reported in Italy
were in people aged 60 and over who are generally at higher risk of dying from Covid-19, as illustrated by the increase in CFRs with age shown in Fig. 1a for both countries. The observed difference
may partly stem from the fact that the Italian population in general is older than the Chinese one with
median ages of 45.4 and 38.4 respectively (see Table 3 in Appendix A for full age demographics of
both countries), but additional factors such as different testing strategies and patterns in the social
2

contacts among older and younger generations [e.g., 14] may also play a role. In summary, the larger
share of confirmed cases among elderly people in Italy shown in Fig. 1b, combined with the fact that
the elderly are generally at higher risk when contracting Covid-19, explains the mismatch between
total and age-stratified CFRs shown in Fig. 1a and thus gives rise to Simpson’s paradox in the data.2

A causal model for Covid-19 CFR data

While the previous reasoning provides a perfectly consistent explanation in a statistical sense, the
phenomenon may still seem puzzling as it defies our causal intuition—similar to how an optical illusion defies our visual intuition. Humans appear to naturally extrapolate conditional probabilities to
read them as causal effects, which can lead to inconsistent conclusions and may leave one wondering: how can the disease in Italy be less fatal for the young, less fatal for the old, but more fatal for
the people overall? It is for this reason of ascribing causal meaning to probabilistic statements, that
the reversal of (conditional) probabilities in §2 is perceived as and referred to as a “paradox” [15].
The aspiration to extrapolate causal conclusions from data is particularly strong in the context of a
pandemic, during which many inherently causal questions are naturally asked. For example, politicians and citizens may want to evaluate different strategies to fight the disease by asking interventional (“what if ...?”) or counterfactual (”what would have happened if ...?”) questions. However, it
is a well-known scientific mantra that “correlation does not imply causation”, and observational data
alone (like that in Fig. 1) is generally insufficient to draw causal conclusions. While correlations can
be seen as a result of underlying causal mechanisms [20], different causal models can explain the
same statistical association patterns equally well [17, 18]. Additional assumptions on the underlying
causal structure are therefore necessary to guide reasoning based on observational data.
3.1

Assumptions

Included variables We consider the following three variables for comparing Covid-19 CFRs
across different countries: (i) the country C in which a confirmed case is reported, modelled as
a categorical variable; (ii) the age group A of a positively-tested patient, an ordinal variable with 10year intervals as values; and (iii) the medical outcome, or mortality, M , a binary variable indicating
whether a patient has deceased by the time of reporting (M = 1) or not (M = 0).
Data generating process and causal graph We assume the causal graph shown in Fig. 2, motivated by thinking of the following data-generating process: (1.) Choosing a country at random;
(2.) Given the selected country, sampling a positively-tested patient with age group A; (3.) Conditional on the choice of C and A, sampling the mortality M . This is clearly a very simple and
coarse-grained view of what is known to be a complex underlying phenomenon. As a consequence,
we abstract away various influences and mechanisms within the arrows in Fig. 2. In particular, this
view encompasses at least the following influences:
• (C → A) encodes that the age distribution of cases is countrydependent. This difference might be due to a general difference in age
demographic between countries, but other mechanisms such as intergenerational mixing or age-targeted social distancing may also play a role.

M

• (A → M ) reflects the notion that the disease is more dangerous for the Figure 2:

causal graph: note how,
• (C → M ) summarises country-specific influences on mortality other within this view, age A

pharmaceutical interventions, air pollution levels, and medical infrastruc- effect of country C on
ture, e.g., availability of hospital beds and ventilators. We will refer to the mortality M .
combination of all these effects as a country’s approach.
Causal sufficiency and observational sample In addition, we assume causal sufficiency, meaning
that all common causes of C, A, M are observed (i.e., there are no hidden confounders). Further,
we assume that CFRs and the proportion of cases by age group are based on an observational sample
and thus constitute estimates of P (M = 1|A = a, C = c) and P (A = a|C = c), respectively. We
discuss these assumptions in the context of selection bias in §6.
2

Note that the observed phenomenon can indeed only be explained if there is some association between the
country and the number of confirmed cases per age group: if we simply took a weighted average of the CFRs
shown in Figure 1a using the same P
weights for both
Pncountries, Simpson’s paradox could
Pn not not arise since

Total, direct, and indirect (age-mediated) causal effects on mortality

Having clearly stated our assumptions, we can now answer causal queries within the model postulated in §3.1. In this section, we review definitions of different causal effects (following the treatment
in [15]) and provide interpretations thereof by phrasing them as questions about different aspects of
the CFR data in Fig. 1. We defer a discussion of issues such as identifiability under different conditions to Appendix B. Example calculations for each defined quantity using the data from Fig. 1 can
be found in Appendix C. Throughout, we denote an intervention that externally fixed a variable X
to a particular value x (as opposed to conditioning on it) using the notation do(X = x) [16].
Total causal effect (TCE) First, we may ask about the overall causal effect of country on mortality:
QTCE : “What would be the effect on mortality of changing country from China to Italy?”
The answer to this query is called the average total causal effect (TCE):
Definition 1 (TCE). The TCE of a binary treatment T on Y is defined as the interventional contrast
TCE 0→1 = EY |do(T =1) [Y |do(T = 1)] − EY |do(T =0) [Y |do(T = 0)].
(1)
In our setting (i.e., according to the causal graph in Fig. 2), the country C takes the role of a treatment
that affects the outcome mortality M (denoted by T and Y , respectively, in Defn.1), and (subject to
causal sufficiency) the TCE is simply given by the difference in total CFRs.
Asking “why?”: beyond total effects via mediation analysis While computing the TCE is the
principled way to quantify the total causal influence, it does not help us understand what drives a
difference between two countries, i.e., why it exists in the first place: we may also be interested in
the mechanisms which give rise to different CFRs observed across different countries. Since the age
of patients was crucial for explaining the instance of Simpson’s paradox in §2, we now seek to better
understand the role of age as a mediator of the effect of country on mortality. This seems particularly
relevant from the perspective of countries, which—without being able to influence the age distribution of the general population—only have limited control over the age demographic of confirmed
cases and thus may wish to factor out age-related effects.3 However, such potential mediators are
not reflected within the TCE, as evident from the absence of the age variable A from (9).
The country C causally influences mortality M along two different paths: a direct path C → M ,
giving rise to a direct effect;4 and an indirect path C → A → M mediated by A, giving rise to
an indirect effect. The TCE of C on M considered in §4 thus comprises both direct and indirect
effects. Quantifying such direct and indirect effects is referred to as mediation analysis [15]. The
main challenge is that any changes to the country C will propagate along both direct and indirect
paths, making it difficult to isolate the different effects. The key idea is therefore to let changes
propagate only along one path while somehow controlling or fixing the effect along the other path.
Controlled direct effect (CDE) The simplest way to measure a direct effect is by changing the
treatment (country) while keeping the mediator fixed at a particular value. For example, we may ask
about the causal effect for a particular age group such as 50–59 years olds:
QCDE(50−59) : “For 50–59 year-olds, is it safer to get the disease in China or in Italy?”
Because it involves actively controlling the value of the mediator, the answer to such a query is
referred to as the average controlled direct effect (CDE). It is defined as follows.
Definition 2 (CDE). The CDE of a binary treatment T on an outcome Y with mediator X = x is
CDE0→1 (x) = E[Y |do(T = 1, X = x)] − E[Y |do(T = 0, X = x)].
(2)
For our assumed setting, the CDE is given by the difference of CFRs for a given age group. A practical
shortcoming of the CDE is that for real world scenarios it is often difficult or even impossible to
control both the treatment and the mediator.5 Another problem is that the CDE does not provide a
global quantity for comparing baseline and treatment: in our setting, there is a different CDE for
each age group. However, we may instead want to measure a direct effect at the population level.
3
The demographic of confirmed cases can be influenced, e.g., via measures such as targeted isolation of the
elderly, see also the discussion of the arrow C → A in §3.1.
4
Recall that the direct effect of country on mortality is likely mediated by additional variables, which are
subsumed in C → M in the current view—see §6 for further discussion.
5
In medical settings, for example, one generally cannot easily control individual down-stream effects of a
drug within the body, such as fixing, e.g., blood glucose levels while changing treatments.

4

Natural direct effect (NDE) Instead of fixing the mediator to a specific value (selecting a particular
age group), we can consider the hypothetical question of what would happen under a change in
treatment (country) if the mediator (age) kept behaving as it would under the control, i.e., as if
the change only propagated along the direct path. This corresponds to asking about the effect of
switching country without affecting the age distribution across the confirmed cases.
QNDE : “For the Chinese case demographic, would the Italian approach have been better?”
As it relies on the distribution of the mediator (age) under the control (China) to evaluate the treatment (“switching approach”), the answer to QNDE is known as average natural direct effect (NDE).
Definition 3 (NDE). The NDE of a binary treatment T on an outcome Y mediated by X is given by
NDE 0→1

= E[YX(0) |do(T = 1)] − E[Y |do(T = 0)].

(3)

where X(0) refers to the counterfactual distribution of X had T been 0.
Natural indirect effect (NIE) For isolating the indirect effect that a country exhibits on mortality
only via age, C → A → M , we run into the additional complication that it is not possible to keep
the influence along the direct path C → M constant under a change in treatment (country). To
overcome this problem, one can consider a hypothetical change in the distribution of the mediator
(age) as if the treatment (country) were changed, but without actually changing it. E.g., we may ask:
QNIE : “How would the overall CFR in China change if the case demographic had instead been that
from Italy, while keeping all else (i.e., the CFR’s of each age group) the same?”
Since this considers a change of the mediator (age) to the natural distribution it would follow under
a change treatment (case demographic from Italy) while keeping the treatment the same (Chinese
CFR ’s), the answer to this question is referred to as the average natural indirect effect ( NIE).
Definition 4 (NIE). The NIE of a binary treatment T on an outcome Y with mediator X is given by
NIE 0→1

= E[YX(1) |do(T = 0)] − E[Y |do(T = 0)].

(4)

Mediation formulas: effects in causally sufficient systems For causally sufficient systems, the
interventional distributions of each variable given its causal parents equal the corresponding observational distributions [16], corresponding to the intuition that they represent mechanisms rather than
mere mathematical constructs [18]. This means that TCE (1) and CDE (2) reduce to:
obs

TCE 0→1
obs
CDE0→1 (x)

= E[Y |T = 1] − E[Y |T = 0],

(5)

= E[Y |T = 1, X = x] − E[Y |T = 0, X = x].

(6)

Moreover, in this case, NDE (3) and NIE (4) are given by the following mediation formulas [15]:


P
obs
NDE 0→1 =
(7)
x P X = x|T = 0 E[Y |T = 1, X = x] − E[Y |T = 0, X = x] ,

P
obs
NIE0→1 =
(8)
x P (X = x|T = 1) − P (X = x|T = 0) E[Y |T = 0, X = x].
When comparing CFRs across countries, we only have access to observational data and thus rely on
the assumption of causal sufficiency to compute total, direct and indirect effects via (5), (6) (7), (8).
Relation between TCE, NDE, and NIE Can the total causal effect be decomposed into a sum of
direct and indirect contributions? While such an additive decomposition indeed exists for linear
models,6 it does not hold in general due to possible interactions between treatment and mediator,
referred to as moderation.7 Direct and indirect effects are not uniquely defined in general, but depend
on the value of the mediator. Counterfactual quantities such as NDE and NIE are thus useful tools to
measure some average form of direct and indirect effect with a meaningful interpretation.
6

in which causal effects can be seen as path coefficients that can be multiplied to obtain path-specific effects
[17] gives the illustrative example of a drug (treatment) that works by activating some proteins (mediator)
inside the body before jointly attacking the disease: the drug is useless without the activated proteins (so the
direct effect is zero) and the activated protein is useless without the chemical compound of the drug (so the
indirect effect is also zero), but the total effect is non-zero because of the interaction between the two.

Figure 3: Evolution of TCE, NDE, and NIE of changing country from China to Italy on total CFR
over time. We compare static data from China [27] with different snapshots from Italy reported
by [10]. The direct effect initially was negative, meaning that age-specific mortality in Italy was
lower; however, it changes sign around mid-March when an overloaded health system in northern
Italy was reported [1]. The indirect effect remains mostly constant at a substantial +3–3.5%.

Case study: mediation analysis of age-related effects on Covid-19 CFRs

Dataset To employ the tools from mediation analysis outlined in §4 to better understand the influence of age on Covid-19 CFRs, we curated a dataset of confirmed cases and fatalities by age group
(0–9, 10–19, etc.) from eleven countries (Argentina, China, Colombia, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal,
South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea) and the Diamond Princess cruise ship, on
which the disease spread among passengers forced to quarantine on board [22]. The dataset includes
756,004 cases and 68,508 fatalities (total cumulative CFR of 9.06%), reported either by the different
countries’ national health institutes or in scientific publications. The selection of countries is based
on availability of suitable data at the time of writing.8 Where available, we included several reports
from the same country, e.g., for Italy and Spain in weekly intervals. The data and our analysis (in
form of an interactive notebook) are provided in the supplement and will be made publicly available.
The exact sources and several additional figures and tables can be found in Appendices D and E.
Tracing causal effects over time First, we investigate the temporal evolution of direct and indirect
(age-mediated) causal effects on mortality by expanding on the comparison from §2. The result
of tracing TCE, NDE, and NIE of changing from China to Italy over a period of 11 weeks using
(approximately) weekly reports from [10] is shown in Fig. 3. Note that case and fatality numbers
for China remain constant in the figure, so that any changes over time can be attributed to Italy.9
We find that the TCE—which measures what would happen to the total CFR if both CFRs by age
group and case demographic were changed to those from Italy—is positive throughout, reflecting a
higher total CFR in Italy. It increases rapidly from an initial 2.2% (see Fig. 1a) to 9.5% over the first
three weeks considered, and then continues to rise more slowly to 11.4%. This indicates that the
difference between the two countries’ total CFR becomes more pronounced over the time. In order
to understand what drives this difference, we next consider the direct and indirect effects separately.
The NDE—which captures what would happen to the total CFR if the case demographic were kept
the same, while only the approach (CFRs per age group) were changed— is negative at first, meaning
that the considered change in approach would initially be beneficial, consistent with the lower CFRs
in each age group shown in Fig. 1a. However, at a turning point around mid March the NDE changes
8
Unfortunately, conventions on how to group patients by age vary across countries: e.g., Belgium, Canada,
France, and Germany do not consistently use 10-year intervals; others such as the US use different groupings
(0–4, 5–14, etc). For some countries (e.g., Brazil, Russia, Turkey, UK) we did not find demographic data.
9
We did not find updated data beyond [27], though not many new cases have been reported from China
since.

treatment country (rows). Numbers show the change in total CFR in %, i.e., negative numbers
indicate that switching to the treatment country’s approach, i.e., its CFRs by age group, (NDE) or case
demographic (NIE) would lead to a decrease in total CFR. Countries are ordered by their average
effect as a treatment country (NDE or NIE) over the remaining 11 data points as a control.
sign: beyond this point, switching to the Italian approach would lead to an increase in total CFR.
While we can only speculate about the precise factors that came together in producing this reversal
in NDE, it seems worth pointing out that a number of articles reported an overwhelmed health care
system “close to collapse” in (northern) Italy during that very period of early to mid-March [1]. The
NDE then keeps rising steeply until early April before gradually flattening off, similar to the TCE .
The NIE—which measures what would happen to total CFR if the approach were kept the same, while
the case demographic were changed to that in Italy—on the other hand, remains largely constant over
time, fluctuating between 3 and 3.5%, indicating that the case demographic in Italy does not change
much over time. Its large value of over 3% means that simply changing the case demographic from
China to that in Italy would already lead to a substantial increase in total CFR, consistent with the
larger share of confirmed cases amongst the elderly in Italy shown in Fig. 1b.
In summary, while indirect age-related effects considerably contribute to differences in total CFR—
especially initially, when the instance of Simpson’s paradox from §2 is reflected in the opposite signs
of NDE and NIE—it is mainly the direct effect that drives the observed changes over time.
Comparison between several different countries We now leave the specific example of China vs
Italy aside and turn to a comparison of different causal effects on Covid-19 mortality between the 12
countries (incl. the Diamond Princess) contained in our dataset.10 All pairwise effects on total CFR
(in %) of changing only “approach”, i.e., the CFRs by age group, (NDE; left) or case demographic
(NIE; right) from a control country (columns) to a treatment country (rows) are shown in Fig. 4.
For ease of visualisation, the order in which countries are presented in Fig. 4 was chosen according
to their average effect as a treatment over the remaining countries as control (i.e., by the mean
of rows) for NDE and NIE separately. This allows to read off trends about the effectiveness of
different approaches and the influence of the case demographic (subject to limitations such as, e.g.,
differences in testing which we discuss further in §6). In the case of NDE, for example, the Diamond
Princess, China, Portugal, and South Korea compare favourably to most others in terms of their
approaches, while the Netherlands, Sweden, and Italy occupy the bottom end of the range. In the
case of NIE, on the other hand, South Africa, Colombia, and Argentina benefit most from their case
demographic compared to other countries, while Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and the Diamond
Princess are particularly affected by an adverse age distribution across confirmed cases.
Notably, there is no significant correlation between countries’ ranking by NDE and NIE (Spearman’s
ρ = 0.04, p = 0.9), suggesting that a country’s approach and case demographic may be largely

We use the latest reported numbers available at the time of writing: except for China (17 February), the
Diamond Princess (26 March), and Sweden (18 May) all reports are from the period of 25–29 May.

unrelated. While some countries such as South Korea, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Italy take
almost the same place according to both rankings of particular interest are those countries for which
rankings by NDE and NIE differ most. Other than for the Diamond Princess—which due to small
sample size and high testing rates constitutes an illustrative special case that we discuss further
in §6—the case of high ranking (rk) in terms of NDE and low ranking in terms of NIE is most most
pronounced for Spain (rkNDE − rkNIE = −4), Portugal (−3), and China (−3). This suggests that,
for the case of Spain, the high total CFR may, at least in parts, be attributed to an unfavourable
case demographic, while the approaches (age-specific mortality) of China and Portugal may be even
better than suggested by their (already comparatively low) total CFRs. Conversely, countries that
rank considerably higher in terms of NIE than NDE include Colombia (+7), South Africa (+6),
and Argentina (+5). These countries’ low total CFRs may thus wrongly suggest a very successful
approach while the low total CFR may actually, at least in parts, be due to an advantageous case
demographic—again, subject to caveats such as differences in testing, see §6 for more details.
Noting that South Africa, Colombia, and Argentina are also the three youngest amongst the considered countries in terms of median age, we computed the Spearman correlation between the ranking
of countries by NIE (as shown in Fig. 4) and by their median age and found a strong correlation between the two (ρ = 0.94, p = 7 × 10−6 ). This indicates that, for the countries considered, the case
demographic is predominantly determined by the age distribution of the population, and suggests
that countries seem not to make (effective) use of strategies such as, e.g., age-specific quarantines.
As a further investigation into the relation between direct and indirect effects on Covid-19 mortality,
we find that, of the 132 ordered pairs of distinct countries, 64 exhibit opposite signs of NDE and
NIE (as for the example of Simpson’s paradox in §2, see also dates from early March in Fig. 3),
meaning that comparing countries in terms of total CFR may not give an accurate picture of the
relative effectiveness of two countries’ approaches in those cases. Overall, pairwise NDEs and NIEs
are only weakly but significantly correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.17, p = 0.04) as shown in Fig. 5a.

Discussion

In this work, we have taken a coarse-grained causal modelling perspective considering the variables
country C, age group A, and mortality M , which are commonly reported in the context of Covid-19
CFR data. This view abstracts away many potentially important factors (some of which we have
named in §3.1) within the paths of the assumed causal graph. A strength of this approach is that it
allows for consistent reasoning about age-mediated and non-age-related effects within the assumed
model in situations where the data does not support a more fine-grained analysis. On the other
hand, any conclusions drawn must be interpreted within this coarse-grained framework: we have
thus referred to various country-specific influences on mortality collectively as “approach”.
Considering additional mediators It is safe to assume that the virus is ultimately agnostic to the
notion of different “countries” and that the influence of country on mortality C → M is not actually
a direct one, but instead mediated by additional variables Xi , as illustrated in Fig. 5b. Candidates for
such additional mediators Xi include, e.g., non-pharmaceutical interventions and critical healthcare
infrastructure. We believe that many questions of interest regarding the Covid-19 pandemic can be
phrased as path-specific causal effects involving such mediators, e.g.: “What would be the effect
on total CFR if country C1 bought as many ventilators as country C2 ?”. Assuming more finegrained data will become available as the pandemic progresses, extending our model with additional
8

mediators and investigating their effects by building on the tools described in §4 is a promising
future direction to deepen our understanding about which factors most drive Covid-19 mortality.
Testing strategy and selection bias An important potential limitation of our approach (or, more
fundamentally, of CFR data) is that we only consider confirmed cases, i.e., patients who tested positively for Covid-19. We can make this explicit in our model by including test status T as additional
variable. Our data is then always conditioned on T = 1, as illustrated in Fig. 5c. Since who is tested
is not random, but generally depends both on a country’s testing strategy and a patient’s age (e.g.,
via severity of symptoms), reflected by the arrows {C, A} → M in Fig. 5c, this results in a problem
of selection bias [19]. This issue is particularly clear for the case of the Diamond Princess on which
“3,063 PCR tests were performed among [the 3,711] passengers and crew members. Testing started
among the elderly passengers, descending by age” [22]. As a result of such extensive testing, the
proportion of asymptomatic cases on board was very high (318 out of 619 detected cases), leading to
low CFRs as manifested in the negative NDEs for the Diamond Princess as treatment in Fig. 4. This
rate of testing is presently not feasible for countries with millions of inhabitants. Since testing capacities differ across countries, the reported CFR’s may thus often not be comparable. Furthermore,
a second source of selection bias may stem from the choice of countries which were included in our
dataset: we only considered countries that report CFRs for age groups separately—those might be
particularly affected by the pandemic. The cumulative CFR of 9% in our data may thus be inflated by
such selection processes. Building on recent work in the causal inference literature on recoverability
from selection bias may help account for this aspect of the problem [2, 5].

Conclusion

We have shown how causal reasoning can guide the interpretation of data of the ongoing pandemic.
In particular, mediation analysis provides tools of separating effects due to different factors which,
if not properly identified, can lead to misleading conclusions. We exploited these tools to uncover
patterns in the time evolution of the pandemic in Italy, and in the comparison of multiple countries.
In order to study age-mediated and age-unrelated effects on CFR across different countries, we curated a large-scale dataset from a multitude of sources; to the best of our knowledge, data allowing
for this kind of analysis has not been aggregated before.
All datasets and an interactive notebook to reproduce and expand on our analyses are publicly available at: github.com/Juliusvk/Covid19-age-related-causal-effects

Additional concepts from mediation analysis

B.1

Experimental (non-)identifiability of direct and indirect effects

Since the CDE in (2) only involves interventional quantities it is in principle experimentally identifiable, meaning that it can be determined through an experimental study in which both the treatment
and the mediator are randomised, thus providing valid estimates of P (Y |do(T = t, X = x)).
In contrast, NDE and NIE are, in general (i.e., without further assumptions), not experimentally
identifiable owing to their counterfactual nature. However, under certain conditions such nonconfoundedness of mediator and outcome experimental identifiability is obtained.11 In this case:

P
exp
NDE 0→1 =
x P X = x|do(T = 0) (E[Y |do(T = 1, X = x)] − E[Y |do(T = 0, X = x)]) ,


P
exp
NIE 0→1 =
E[Y |do(T = 0, X = x)] .
x P X = x|do(T = 1) − P X = x|do(T = 0)
Note that even then, identifying natural effects requires combining results from two different experimental settings: one where both mediator and treatment are randomised, and a second in which
treatment is randomised and the mediator observed. This again highlights the hypothetical nature
of NDE and NIE and explains why they—unlike TCE and CDE—cannot simply be read off from a
table like Table 1, even when causal sufficiency is assumed.
B.2

Subtractivity principle

There exists a general formula relating TCE, NDE, and NIE known as the subtractivity principle that
follows from their definitions and holds without restrictions on the type of model [15]:
TCE 0→1 = NDE 0→1 − NIE 1→0 = NIE0→1 − NDE 1→0 .

C

Example calculations for TCE, CDE, NDE and NIE

C.1

TCE

To address QTCE in our example we need to compute
TCE China→Italy = E[M |do(C = Italy)] − E[M |do(C = China)].

(9)

From the assumed causal graph and causal sufficiency, it follows that for our setting P (A|do(C)) =
P (A|C) and P (M |do(A, C)) = P (M |A, C). We can thus compute (9) as
X

TCE China→Italy =
PM |A,C (1|a, Italy)PA|C (a|Italy) − PM |A,C (1|a, China)PA|C (a|China)
a

≈ 2.2%.
Note that this corresponds to the difference of total CFRs reported in the last column of Table 1. This
means that the difference of total CFRs indeed constitutes a causal effect, and changing country from
China to Italy would lead to an overall increase in CFR of ≈ 2.2% (given the data in Table 1 and
subject to our modelling assumptions).
C.2

CDE

To address QCDE(a) in our example, we need to compute
CDE China→Italy (a)

= E[M |do(C = Italy, A = a)] − E[M |do(C = China, A = a)]
= P (M = 1|do(C = Italy, A = a)) − P (M = 1|do(C = China, A = a))
= P (M = 1|C = Italy, A = a) − P (M = 1|C = China, A = a).

This corresponds to the difference between CFRs across the two countries within a particular age
group, i.e., the difference of two CFRs within a particular column of Table 1. Hence, the answer to
QCDE(50–59) is that for this age group it is safer to switch country to Italy with a resulting change in
CFR of ≈ 0.2% − 1.3% = −1.1%. (Bear in mind that this calculation is based on Italian data from
beginning of March.)
11

A more general criterion is the existence of a set of covariates W , non-descendants of T and X, which
satisfy the graphical d-separation criterion (Y ⊥
⊥ X|W )GTX , see [15, Thms. 1&4] for details.

14

C.3

NDE

Applying our assumptions, in particular causal sufficiency, we can calculate the NDE to answer QNDE
for our running example as follows,
NDE China→Italy

= E[MA(China) |do(C = Italy)] − E[MA(China) |do(C = China)]
X


=
PA|do(C) (a|do(China)) PM |do(A,C) (1|do(a, Italy)) − PM |do(A,C) (1|do(a, China))
a

=

X



PA|C (a|China) PM |A,C (1|a, Italy) − PM |A,C (1|a, China)

a



= EA|C=China CDEChina→Italy (A) ≈ −0.8%.
We thus find that when we only consider the Chinese case demographic, using the Italian approach
(i.e., the CFRs for Italy from Table 1) would lead to a reduction in total CFR of ≈ 0.8%, consistent
with our observation from §2 that CFRs were lower in Italy for each age group.
Remark 1. As is apparent from the last line of the above calculation, the NDE can be interpreted as
an expected CDE w.r.t. a particular (counterfactual) distribution of the mediator. Here, due to our
assumption of causal sufficiency the expectation is taken w.r.t. the conditional distribution of A in
the control group (China).
Remark 2. Taking the previous remark about NDE as the expected CDE within the control group
one step further, we can, of course, also consider expected CDEs w.r.t. other distributions describing
a target-population we want to reason about. For example, a third country, say Spain, may be
considering whether to adopt the Chinese or Italian approach given its own case demographic. In
this case, we would be interested in the following quantity.

EA|C=Spain [CDEChina→Italy (A)] = a PA|C (a|Spain)CDEChina→Italy (a)
C.4

NIE

Again, using causal sufficiency, we can calculate the NIE to answer QNIE for our example as follows,
NIEChina→Italy

= E[MA=AItaly |do(C = China)] − E[MA=AChina |do(C = China)]
X

=
PA|do(C) (a|do(Italy)) − PA|do(C) (a|do(China)) PM |do(A,C) (1|do(a, China))
a

X

=
PA|C (a|Italy) − PA|C (a|China) PM |A,C (1|a, China)
a

≈ 3.3%
We thus find that changing only the case demographic to that from Italy would lead to a substantial
increase in total CFR in China of about 3.3%. Notably, the NIE is of the opposite sign of the NDE
suggesting that indirect and direct effects are counteracting in our example as the reader may have
expected from §2: despite the lower CFRs in each age group (leading to a negative NDE) the total
CFR is larger in Italy due to the higher age of positively-tested patients (leading to a positive NIE ).
C.5

Substractivity-principle

In our running example we find that
TCE China→Italy

= 2.2% 6= −0.8% + 3.3% = NDEChina→Italy + NIEChina→Italy

indicating that some level of moderation or interaction is present.

Dataset details

In this Appendix, we provide further details on the datasets of age-stratified case and fatality numbers
curated as part of this work. We provide three different datasets:
• A dataset containing the latest age-stratified case and fatality numbers for all different countries considered in our analysis, described in more detail in D.1.
• A dataset containing longitudinal age-stratified case and fatality numbers for Italy, described in more detail in D.2.
• A dataset containing longitudinal age-stratified case and fatality numbers for Spain, described in more detail in D.3.
All datasets are contained in the supplementary material in multiple commonly-used formats (.csv,
.xlsx, .json, .pkl) and will be made publicly available upon publication.
D.1

Dataset of latest age-stratified case and fatality numbers for different countries

An overview of the dataset of latest age-stratified case and fatality numbers for different countries
in the form of metadata is shown in Table 4.
CFR s

and absolute case and fatality numbers in age-stratified form are shown in Table 5.

Additional results and figures
Temporal CFR data for Spain

We perform a similar analysis of the temporal evolution of different causal effects of changing
country from China to Spain, as done for Italy in §5 and Fig. 3. The results are shown in Fig. 8.
Recall that the control China remains fixed throughout so that any changes can be attributed to
changes in the Spanish data.
Interestingly, a reversal in the sign of the NDE can also be observed for Spain, taking place around
30 March. This bears similarity to the reversal of NDE observed for Italy. The initial increase in NDE
is also reflected in the age-specific CFRs shown in the middle of Fig. 8 which are initally increasing
for most age groups. Unlike Italy, however, NDE and TCE do not increase monotonically, but reach a
maximum (over the time period considered) around 23 April and subsequently decrease again. The
NIE also appears less constant than for the case of changing country to Italy shown in Fig. 3, steadily
climbing from intially 2.3% to 3.1% at the end of May (ca. 35% increase).
As a remark of caution, we point out that the total number of fatalities reported by the Spanish
ministry in age-stratified form is considerably lower than the number of fatalities reported (without
separation into age groups) by different sources such as, e.g., [25]. This may have different reasons
such as, e.g., latency in their reporting of fatalities in general, or of the exact age group of deceased
patients specifically. As a result, CFRs from Spain are lower than other sources suggest, and may
thus not be very reliable.
E.2

Comparison of age-specific CFRs and case demographic between different countries

A visual comparison of CFRs by age group and case demographic (similar to that shown in Fig. 1
for only China and Italy) for all different countries in our dataset is shown in Fig. 9.
E.3

TCEs between different countries

In addition to the pair-wise NDEs and NIEs between the different countries in our dataset, we also
show the pair-wise TCEs for completeness in Fig. 10. Note that—as opposed to NDE and NIE—the
TCE is, by definition, symmetric, i.e., TCE 0→1 = − TCE 1→0 , as can be seen from Fig. 10.

treatment country (rows). Numbers show the change in total CFR in %, i.e., negative numbers
indicate that switching to the treatment country’s approach in terms of both CFRs by age group and
case demographic would lead to a decrease in total CFR. Countries are ordered by their average
