Abstract A pandemic caused by a new coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, inducing an epidemic still active in Argentina. In this chapter, we present a case
study using an SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) diffusion model of
fractional order in time to analyze the evolution of the epidemic in Buenos Aires and
neighboring areas (Regi√≥n Metropolitana de Buenos Aires, (RMBA)) comprising
about 15 million inhabitants. In the SEIR model, individuals are divided into four
classes, namely, susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I) and recovered (R). The
SEIR model of fractional order allows for the incorporation of memory, with hereditary properties of the system, being a generalization of the classic SEIR first-order
system, where such effects are ignored. Furthermore, the fractional model provides
one additional parameter to obtain a better fit of the data. The parameters of the
model are calibrated by using as data the number of casualties officially reported.
Since infinite solutions honour the data, we show a set of cases with different values
of the lockdown parameters, fatality rate, and incubation and infectious periods. The
different reproduction ratios ùëÖ0 and infection fatality rates (IFR) so obtained indicate
the results may differ from recent reported values, constituting possible alternative

solutions. A comparison with results obtained with the classic SEIR model is also included. The analysis allows us to study how isolation and social distancing measures
affect the time evolution of the epidemic.

1 Introduction
We present an SEIR subdiffusion model of fractional order ùúà, with 0 < ùúà ‚â§ 1 to
analyze the time evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in Buenos Aires and neighboring areas (Region Metropolitana de Buenos Aires, (RMBA)) with a population
of about 15 million inhabitants. RMBA consists of Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos
Aires (CABA) plus forty municipalities covering an area of about thirteen thousand
square kilometers, where some of these municipalities have rural areas. Thus, RMBA
has an average population density of 1100 people/km2, but in CABA and many of
its neighboring cities this number increases significantly. For example, CABA has a
population density of about 14000 people/km2. In this work, we consider that RMBA
has a uniform population distribution.
The epidemic started officially on March 9th with the number of cases and deaths
still increasing at the day of writing (September 22th, 2020. The classical SEIR
model (ùúà = 1) has been used by Carcione et al. [1] and Santos et al. [2] to model the
COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and Argentina, respectively.
Fractional calculus has been used to define diffusion and wave propagation models
in biological and viscoelastic materials [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. One important property
of the fractional-order SEIR model is that incorporates memory and hereditary
properties, a behavior exhibited by most biological systems. The use of fractional
order derivatives affects the duration of the epidemic, peaks of infected and dead
individuals per day and number of number casualties.
Among other authors that have applied fractional calculus to obtain solutions
of the SEIR model, we mention Scherer et al. [11], that used a Gr√ºnwald-Letnikov
time-discrete procedure, introduced by Ciesielski and Leszczynski [12] (CL method).
Besides, Zeb et al. [13] presented an analysis of several numerical methods to solve
the SEIR model of fractional order. For general works on fractional calculus including
numerical methods, we refer to Podlubny [14] and Li and Zeng [15].
We first formulate an initial-value problem (IVP) for the classical SEIR model
(ùúà = 1) and the SEIR subdiffusion equations of fractional order ùúà at the continuous
level using the Caputo definition of the fractional derivative [6]. Existence and
uniqueness of the solution of this IVP, with positive values, is demonstrated in [13].
The numerical solutions of the continuous IVP are computed by using the timeexplicit algorithm of Gorenflo-Mainardi-Moretti-Paradisi (GMMP method) [16, 17].
The conditional stability of the time-explicit GMMP method (and also of the CL
method) was demonstrated by Murillo et al. [19] [see their equation (19)]. The
validation of the GMMP method is performed by comparison of its results against
those of the classic SEIR model and those of the fractional Adams-Bashford-Moulton
method (ABM method) as defined in [15].

The parameters of the SEIR model are the birth and death rates, infection and
incubation periods, probability of disease transmission per contact, fatality rate and
initial number of exposed individuals. These parameters, together with the order of
the fractional derivative, are obtained by fitting the number of fatalities officially
reported. This is an inverse problem with an infinite number of solutions (local
minima) honouring the data, which is solved by using a quasi-Newton technique
for nonlinear least squares problem with the formula of Broyden-Fletcher-GoldfarbShanno [20]. The numerical simulations give an effective procedure to study the
spread of the evolution of virus, analyze the effects of the lockdown measures and
predict the peak of infected and dead individuals per day.

2 The Caputo derivative and initial value problems
For 0 < ùúà ‚â§ 1, the time fractional Caputo derivative ùê∑ ùëêùúà (ùë¢(ùë°) is defined as [3, 16,
17, 6]

where Œì(¬∑) denotes the Euler‚Äôs Gamma function.
Note that the Caputo derivatives of constant functions ùëì (ùë°) = 1 vanish and those
of powers of ùë°, ùëì (ùë°) = ùë° ùëò are
Œì(ùëò + 1) ùëò‚àíùúà

Œì(ùëò ‚àí ùúà + 1)
The advantage of using the Caputo derivative in Caputo-type IVP‚Äôs is that the initial
conditions are the same as those of the classical ordinary differential equations.
For details on the Caputo derivative and its relation with the Riemann-Liouville
fractional derivative we refer to [6].
To approximate the time-fractional Caputo derivative, we use a backward
Gr√ºnwald-Letnikov approximation at time ùë° ùëõ = ùëõŒîùë°, ùëõ = 0, 1, , ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , with ùëìùëõ =

The work by Abdullah et al. [18] presents an analysis of the fractional-order SEIR
model formulated in terms of the Caputo derivative and its GMMP time discretization.

3 The classical and fractional-order SEIR models
The IVP for the classic SEIR system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations is
ùêº (ùë°)
ùëÜ¬§ = ùëì1 (ùëÜ, ùê∏, ùêº, ùëÖ) (ùë°) = Œõ ‚àí ùúáùëÜ(ùë°) ‚àí ùõΩùëÜ(ùë°)
,
ùëÅ (ùë°)
ùêº (ùë°)
ùê∏¬§ = ùëì2 (ùëÜ, ùê∏, ùêº, ùëÖ) (ùë°) = ùõΩùëÜ(ùë°)
‚àí (ùúá + ùúñ)ùê∏ (ùë°),
ùëÅ (ùë°)
ùêº¬§ = ùëì3 (ùëÜ, ùê∏, ùêº, ùëÖ) (ùë°) = ùúñ ùê∏ (ùë°) ‚àí (ùõæ + ùúá + ùõº)ùêº (ùë°),
ùëÖ¬§ = ùëì4 (ùëÜ, ùê∏, ùêº, ùëÖ) (ùë°) = ùõæùêº (ùë°) ‚àí ùúáùëÖ(ùë°),

(4)

with initial conditions ùëÜ(0), ùê∏ (0), ùêº (0) and ùëÖ(0). A dot above a variable indicates
the time derivative, while ùëÅ (ùë°) is the number of live individuals at time ùë°, i.e.,
ùëÅ = ùëÜ + ùê∏ + ùêº + ùëÖ ‚â§ ùëÅ0 , ùëÅ0 being the total initial population. In (4), ùëÜ is the
number of individuals susceptible to be exposed while ùê∏ is the number of exposed
individuals, in which the disease is latent; they are infected but not infectious.
Individuals in the ùê∏-class become infected (ùêº) with a rate ùúñ and infected become
recovered (ùëÖ) with a rate ùõæ. People in the ùëÖ class do not move back to the ùëÜ class
since lifelong immunity is assumed. Furthermore, 1/ùõæ and 1/ùúñ are the infection and
incubation periods, respectively, Œõ is the birth rate, ùúá is the natural per capita death
rate, ùõº is the average fatality rate, and ùõΩ is the probability of disease transmission
per contact. All of these coefficients have units of 1/time. Given the short period of
the epidemic in Argentina (6 months at the time of writing), and that the average life
expectancy is about 76 years, it is reasonable to assume that Œõ = ùúáùëÅ, so that the
deaths balance the newborns.
Dead individuals ùê∑ (ùë°) are computed as ùê∑ (ùë°) = ùëÅ0 ‚àí ùëÅ (ùë°), so that the dead people
per unit time ùê∑¬§ (ùë°), can be obtained as [21]:
ùê∑¬§ (ùë°) = ùõºùêº (ùë°).

Next, we reformulate the system (4) into a fractional-order system by using the
Caputo derivative in (1):

ùê∑ ùëêùúà ùê∏ (ùë°) = ùëì2ùúà (ùëÜ, ùê∏, ùêº, ùëÖ) (ùë°) = ùõΩ ùúà ùëÜ(ùë°)

(6)

The reproduction ratio, ùëÖ0 , indicates the number of cases induced by a single
infectious individual. When ùëÖ0 < 1, the disease dies out; when ùëÖ0 > 1, an epidemic
occurs. Al-Sheikh [22] analyzes the behavior of the SEIR models in terms of ùëÖ0 .
For the SEIR model, ùëÖ0 is given by [23]
ùëÖ0 =

(ùúñ ùúà

where this relation holds at all times, not only at the end of the epidemic.

The results of the GMMP method (9)-(12) will be validated against the solution
of the classical SEIR model (ùúà = 1) and the Adams-Bashford-Moulton (ABM)
time-explicit scheme as defined in [15] and included in the Appendix.

4 Numerical results.
4.1 Validation of the GMMP algorithm
The results of the GMMP algorithm are cross-checked with those of the ABM solver
for the classical SEIR model (ùúà = 1 ) and SEIR models of fractional orders ùúà = 0.9
and 0.8.
We use the following parameters, given in Chowel et al. [24] and used by Carcione
et al. [1] to perform a parametric analysis of the model. Average disease incubation
1/ùúñ = 3 days, infectious period 1/ùõæ = 8 days, induced fatality rate ùõº = 0.006/day,
ùõΩ = 0.75/day, and Œõ = ùúá = 0. The initial conditions are ùê∏ (0) = 1, ùëÜ(0) = ùëÅ (0) ‚àí
ùê∏ (0) ‚àí ùêº (0), ùêº (0) = 1 and ùëÖ(0) = 0. The time step is ùëëùë° = 0.01 day and N0 = 10
million. This case corresponds to a high reproduction ratio ùëÖ0 = 5.72.
Figures 1‚Äì6 show the results of the four classes, S,E,I,R, and the dead and dead
per day individuals computed by using the GMMP and ABM algorithms. First, an
excellent agreement between the results of the two algorithms is observed for all
values of the fractional order derivative ùúà. To quantify this agreement, we compute a
mean squared relative error between the estimations of both methods. For example,
in the computation of infected individuals, the following errors are obtained: 1.512 √ó
10‚àí5 for ùúà = 1, 9.880 √ó 10‚àí6 for ùúà = 0.9 and 1.053 √ó 10‚àí5 for ùúà = 0.8. In particular,
the results for ùúà = 1 agree with those of Figures 1 and 2 in [1]. Figure 1 shows
that decreasing the order of the fractional derivative causes a delay and an increase
in the number of susceptible individuals. While for the classical model the number
of infectious individuals vanish at long times, this is not the case for the orders
ùúà = 0.8 and ùúà = 0.9 (Figure 3). We run the simulator up to a very long time but the
individuals do not vanish, so that the epidemic never ends (in theory). This happens
because ùëÖ0 ‚â• 1. We run other examples with different parameters such that ùëÖ0 < 1
and as expected the number of infectious individuals vanish and the epidemic dies
out. For brevity these plots are not shown. The case ùëÖ0 < 1 is analyzed in Subsection
4.2, when simulating the evolution of the epidemic in the RMBA using fractional
derivatives. This value of ùëÖ0 is associated with the strict lockdown imposed by the
government, with a corresponding decrease in the number of infected individuals.
Regarding the exposed infected classes (Figures 2-3), a decrease in ùúà causes delays
and reduces the amplitude of the peaks of these classes. Furthermore, as ùúà decreases
the number of casualties increase as seen in Figure 4 while Figure 6 shows a delay
and increase of the peak in the number of dead individuals per day. Also, note that
Figure 5 shows a delay and decrease in the number of recovered individuals as the
order of the fractional derivative decreases.
These simulations consider a single value of ùõΩ, the lockdown parameter. In a
realistic case, ùõΩ is a function of time and the procedure is that every time ùõΩ changes,
the algorithm has to be fully initialized from the beginning. Changing ùõΩ in the same
time loop yields wrong results. This fact has been verified by cross-checking different
algorithms and several fractional orders.

4.2 Analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic in the RMBA
We model the COVID-19 epidemic in the RMBA, with a population ùëÅ0 = 14839026
individuals according to the 2010 Census (https://www.indec.gob.ar/indec/
web/Nivel4-Tema-2-41-135). The prediction of the time evolution of the epidemic is very difficult due to the uncertainty of the parameters defining the SEIR
model. Virus properties such as the infectious and incubation periods (ùõæ ‚àí1 and ùúñ ‚àí1 )
and life expectancy of an infected individual (ùõº‚àí1 ) lie in certain bounded intervals.
Instead, the parameter ùõΩ is time dependent, due to changes according to the lockdown and social-distance measures imposed by the government. Most authors use the
infectious individuals to calibrate the model, e.g., Gonz√°lez-Parra et al. [25], who
model the AH1N1/09 influenza epidemic in Bogot√°, Colombia and in the Nueva
Esparta state in Venezuela.
Since the number of asymptomatic, undiagnosed infectious individuals in RMBA
is unknown, we choose to calibrate the model with the number of officially reported casualties as the most reliable data, from day 1 (March 9, 2020) to day
198 (September 22th, 2020) (https://www.argentina.gob.ar/coronavirus/
informe-diario). Concerning the parameters, fractional order and initial conditions of the model, we assume ùúá = 3.6 √ó 10 ‚àí5 / day, corresponding to a life expectancy
of 76 years. Changes in the ùõΩ parameter are associated with different measures of
lockdown and social distance imposed by the goverment. Thus, we assume that ùõΩ is
a piecewise constant function, where its variations are related to the inflection points
observed in the curve of casualties. After the initial time ùë°0 = 1 day, this curve shows
two inflection points at times ùë°1 = 31 day and ùë°3 = 50 day. The fractional-order derivative ùúà, the values of ùõº, ùõΩ, ùúñ, ùõæ and the initial exposed individuals ùê∏ (0) are estimated
by minimizing the ùêø 2 -norm between the simulated and actual casualties, which is
an inverse problem with an infinite number of solutions due to the existence of local
minima. The estimation is also performed for the classical case ùúà = 1. This inverse
problem is solved by using a quasi Newton approximation technique for nonlinear
least-squares problems, based on the formula of Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
[20]. Application of this technique to solve inverse problems in reservoir engineering can be found in [26]. Table 1 shows ranges of the fractional derivative ùúà, of the
parameters ùõº, ùõΩ, ùúñ, ùõæ and the initial exposed individuals ùê∏ (0) used in the inversion
procedure. Table 2 displays the initial values and results of four outputs (Cases) of

Let us analyze four cases, resulting from the minimization algorithm. We obtained
the SEIR parameters, the fractional order and the initial exposed humans values fitting
the data. In all the cases, the initial number of infected individuals is assumed to be
ùêº (0) = 100.
Figures 7 and 8 show the dead individuals and dead individuals per day for Case
1. The inflection point at ùë°1 = 30 day, related to a change of ùëÖ0 from 3.178 to
0.688, shows a decay in the simulated curves, because of the effect of the lockdown.
After ùë°1 = 50 day, the curves exhibits a continuous increase in casualties due to the
relaxation of the lockdown measures with ùëÖ0 = 1.725. Figure 9 shows the behavior of
all classes, with a a peak of 555 thousand infected individuals at day 188 (September
12th, 2020) while Figure 10 exhibits a death toll of 19000 people after 800 days
(May 17th, 2022) and a peak of 234 casualties at day 188.
The parameters of Cases 2 and 3 in Table 2 also fit the data, with graphs similar
to those in Figures 7 and 8. Case 2 estimates peaks of 309 deaths and 285 thousand
infected individuals at day 222 (October 16th, 2020). At day 800 (May 17, 2022),
there are 34 thousand deaths and 7457 thousand recovered humans. This increase in

12

the number of casualties is due to the higher infection fatality rate IFR and higher
reproduction ratios ùëÖ0 as compared with those of Case 1 (see Table 2).
Case 3, which corresponds to the classical SEIR model (ùúà = 1), exhibits a peak of
171 casualties at day 184 (September 8th, 2020) and 607 thousand people infected.
The end of the epidemic is consider the day at which the number of infected individuals is smaller than 1, which is day 594 (October 24th, 2021) for this case. At
this day, the total number of recovered and dead individuals are 10157 thousand and
18 thousand, respectively, so that the total number of infected people at the end of
the epidemic is 10175 thousand individuals. This is the case predicting the smallest
number of casualties.
Finally, since the reported number of deceased people could possibly be underestimated due to undeclared cases and delays in the upload of official data, we also
consider a case with 30 % more casualties to date (Case 4 in Table 2), giving IFR =
0.254 % and values of the parameters similar to those of Case 1. Besides, the peak
occurs almost at the same day of Case 1 (day 187: September 11th, 2020) with 592
thousand infected individuals and 296 casualties. This peak of casualties and the
death toll of 24400 individuals are approximately 30 % higher than those of Case 1.

In the following, we compare the behavior of all classes for the different orders
of the fractional derivative used in this analysis, i.e., ùúà = 1, 0.919 and 0.812. Figure
11 displays the number of infected individuals, where there is a delay and decrease
of the peak values as the order of the fractional derivative decreases. This behavior
is consistent with that observed in Figure 3. Figure 12 shows an increase in the
number of casualties by decreasing the order of the fractional derivative, with a 47
% increase between ùúà = 1 and ùúà = 0.812. Moreover, it can be seen that the curves
stabilize at later times as the fractional order decreases. Finally, Figures 13 and 14
exhibit the estimated recovered and susceptible individuals for the three values of ùúà.
Recovered individuals increase and, consequently, susceptible individuals decrease
as the order of fractional derivative increases. The curves exhibit asymptotic values
at later times as ùúà decreases, and the lower the value of ùúà the later individuals recover
from the virus infection. Note that the general trends of Figures 11‚Äì14 are similar to
those of the figures in Subsection 4.1, in spite of the fact that parameters obtained
from the adjustment are different for the three cases.
In the four cases described above, we consider that the initial number of infected
individuals is ùêº (0) = 100. Nevertheless, we tested other values: if ùêº (0) belongs to the
interval [10, 150] a reasonable adjustment is obtained, with similar values to those
shown in Table 2 and a slight delay on the infected individuals peak as ùêº (0) decreases.
Outside this interval, the fit is poor and the results have no physical meaning.

5 Conclusions
We use a fractional SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) diffusion
model to analyze the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in Argentina, particularly
in the Region Metropolitana de Buenos Aires (RMBA), where a significant number
of the population is concentrated.
We solve the SEIR system of fractional order ùúà, 0 < ùúà < 1 and the classical
(ùúà = 1) SEIR model by using a time-explicit Gorenflo-Mainardi-Moretti-Paradisi
(GMMP) method. To validate this method, the results were cross-checked with those
of the time-explicit fractional Adams-Bashford-Moulton (ABM) method, obtaining
an excellent agreement between the two schemes.
Assuming that the birth and death rates are balanced, the parameters that characterize the model are the infection and incubation periods, the probability of disease
transmission per contact, the fatality rate and the initial number of exposed individuals. These parameters and the order ùúà of the fractional derivative are estimated by
fitting the number of casualties officially reported. This inverse problem is solved
by using a quasi-Newton technique for non-linear least-squares problem with the
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno formula.
In all the simulations we used three lockdown parameters (denoted by ùõΩ), associated with the different measures taken by the government during the evolution of
the epidemic. One important conclusion related with this time-dependent parameter
is that both the fractional GMMP and ABM algorithms need to be fully initialized
from the beginning in order to obtain correct results.
Different cases have been analyzed since the inverse problem has an infinite
number of solutions. We observe a similar behavior in all the cases, with a fatality
rate IFR varying in the range, [0.175, 0.444]. After the 50th day of lockdown, it is
observed a continuous increase in casualties due to the relaxation of the preventive
social isolation and community circulation of the virus.
The numerical simulations in RMBA show that when the order of the fractional
derivative decreases, i.e., higher subdiffusion of the virus, the duration of the epidemic is extended, and the peak of infected individuals and number of casualties
increase. Furthermore, the classical SEIR model yield a smaller number of casualties
and infected individuals with associated peaks located at earliest times as compared
with those of the fractional-order cases.
