Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency of international concern affecting 201 countries and territories around the globe. As of April 4,
2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 11,16,643 confirmed infections and
more than 59,170 reported deaths worldwide. The main focus of this paper is two-fold:
(a) generating short term (real-time) forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple
countries; (b) risk assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for
some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To solve the first problem, we
presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and
Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of
the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK.
The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective
allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for government
policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal regression tree algorithm to
find essential causal variables that significantly affect the case fatality rates for different
countries. This data-driven analysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of
early risk assessments for 50 immensely affected countries.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, Wuhan city of China became the centre of an outbreak of pneumonia of
unknown cause, latter named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which raised intense
attention not only within China but internationally [13; 32]. The COVID-19 pandemic is the
most significant global crisis since the World War-II that affected almost all the Countries
of our planet [4]. As of April 4, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 11,16,643

confirmed cases with reported deaths of 59,170 worldwide [22]. On March 11, WHO publicly
characterized COVID-19 as a “global pandemic”, and shortly after that, the United States
declared COVID-19 outbreaks a national emergency. The COVID-19 has caused a great
threat to the health and safety of people all over the world due to its widespread and potential
harm. Thus, the studies of the novel COVID-19 epidemics and its future development trend
has become a cutting-edge research topic at this moment. We are therefore motivated to
ask: (a) Can we generate real-time forecasts of daily new COVID-19 cases for countries
like Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK? (b) What are the probable causal
variables that have significant impacts on the case fatality rates for the profoundly affected
countries?
To answer the first question, we study classical and modern forecasting techniques for
which the prediction accuracy largely depend on the availability of data [28]. In outbreaks of
COVID-19 epidemics, there are limited data available, making predictions widely uncertain.
From previous studies, it was evident that the timing and location of the outbreak facilitated
the rapid transmission of the virus within a highly mobile population [29]. In most of
the affected countries, the governments implemented a strict lockdown in subsequent days
of initial transmission of the virus and within hospitals, patients who fulfill clinical and
epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 are immediately isolated. The constant increase
in the global number of COVID-19 cases is putting a substantial burden on the health
care system for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. To anticipate additional
resources to combat the epidemic, various mathematical and statistical forecasting tools [21;
34] and outside China [20; 36; 10] were applied to generate short-term and long-term forecasts
of reported cases. These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. Since
the time series datasets of COVID-19 contain both nonlinear and nonstationary patterns,
therefore, making decisions based on an individual model would be critical. In this study, we
propose a hybrid modeling approach to generate short-term forecasts for multiple countries.
In traditional time series forecasting, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
model is used predominantly for forecasting linear time series [6]. But in recent literature,
the wavelet transformation based forecasting model has shown excellent performance in
nonstationary time series data modeling [27]. Thus, combining both models may accurately
model such complex autocorrelation structures in the COVID-19 time-series datasets and
reduce the bias and variances of the prediction error of the component models. In the
absence of vaccines or antiviral drugs for COVID-19, these estimates will provide an insight
into the resource allocations for the exceedingly affected countries to keep this epidemic
under control. Besides shedding light on the dynamics of COVID-19 spreading, the practical
intent of this data-driven analysis is to provide government officials with realistic estimates
for the magnitude of the epidemic for policy-making.
The second problem is connected with the global concern of health and mortality due
to the significant COVID-19 outbreaks. Mortality is crudely estimated using a statistic, the
case fatality rate (CFR), which divides the number of known deaths by the total number
of identified cases [18; 5; 30]. During the current phase of this global pandemic, it is criti2

cally important to obtain reliable estimates of the overall CFR. The estimates of CFR are
highly dependent on several country-specific demographic parameters and various disease
characteristics. A key differentiation among the CFR of different countries can be found by
determining an exhaustive list of causal variables that significantly affect CFR. In this work,
we put an effort to identify critical parameters that may help to assess the risk (in terms of
CFR) using an optimal regression tree model [7]. The regression tree has a built-in variable
selection mechanism from high dimensional variable space and can model arbitrary decision
boundaries. The regression tree combines case estimates, epidemiological characteristics of
the disease, and heath-care facilities to assess the risks of major outbreaks for profoundly
affected countries. Such assessments will help to anticipate the expected morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 and provide some critical information for the planning of health care
systems in various countries facing this epidemic.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the data, development of the hybrid model, and experimental results for short-term forecasts of COVID-19 for
Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. In Section 3, country-wise CFR datasets,
method, and results for finding critical parameters are presented. We discuss the assumptions and limitations of our findings in Section 4. Finally, the discussions about the results
and policy recommendations are given in Section 5.
2. Real-time forecasting of COVID-19 cases
We focus on the daily figures of confirmed cases for five different countries, namely
Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The datasets are retrieved by the Global
Change Data Lab1 ). All these datasets are collected from the starting date of the disease for
the respective countries to April 4, 2020. In this section, we first briefly discuss these datasets,
followed by the development of the proposed hybrid model, and finally, the application of
the proposed model to generate short-term forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for five
different countries. All these datasets and codes to be used in this section are made publicly
available at https://github.com/indrajitg-r/COVID for the reproducibility of this work.
2.1. Datasets
Five univariate time-series datasets are collected for the real-time prediction purpose of
COVID-19 cases for India, Canada, France, South Korea, and the UK. Several previous
studies have forecasted future COVID cases for China and a few other countries using mathematical and traditional time series forecasting models, for details see [29; 21; 34; 20; 36].
We try to nowcast the COVID-19 cases of five different countries based on their past cases.
For India and UK, we consider the daily laboratory-confirmed cases from January 30, 2020,
through April 4, 2020 and from January 31, 2020 through April 4, 2020, respectively, for
model building. Daily COVID-19 cases data for Canada, France, and South Korea are taken

for the time period January 20, 2020 through April 4, 2020, January 25, 2020 through April
4 2020, and January 26 through April 4 2020, respectively.
The dataset for India contains a total of 64 observations, 65 observations for the UK,
70 observations for Canada, 71 observations for France, and 76 for South Korea. For these
five countries the outbreaks of COVID-19 started almost from the same timeline and the
epidemic curves still not showing the sharp diminishing nature, just like China. We limit
our attention to trended and non-seasonal models, given the patterns, observed in Table
1.Note that we follow a pragmatic approach in that we assume that the trend will continue
indefinitely in the future in contradiction with other S-curve or deterministic SIR modeling
approaches which assume convergence.

2.2. Proposed Model
To forecast confirmed cases of COVID-19, we adopt hybrid time series forecasting approaches combining ARIMA and wavelet-based forecasting techniques. The proposed hybrid
model overcome the deficiencies of the single time series models. Before describing the proposed methodology, we give a brief description of the individual models to be used in the
hybridization.
2.2.1. ARIMA Model
ARIMA is a classical time series model, used for tracking linear tendencies in stationary
time series data. ARIMA model is denoted by ARIMA(p, d, q). The parameters p and q are
the order of the AR model and the MA model respectively, and d is the level of differencing
[9]. ARIMA model can be mathematically expressed as follows:
yt = θ0 + φ1 yt−1 + φ2 yt−2 + · · · + φp yt−p + εt − θ1 εt−1 − θ2 εt−2 − · · · − θq εt−q ,
where yt denotes the actual value of the variable under consideration at time t, εt is the
random error at time t. The φi and θj are the coefficients of the ARIMA model. The
basic assumption made by the ARIMA model is that the error series follows zero mean
with constant variance, and satisfies the i.i.d condition. Building an ARIMA model for
any given time series dataset can be described in three iterative steps: model identification
(achieving stationarity), parameter estimation (the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the
partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots are used to select the values of parameters
p and q), and model diagnostics checking (finding the ‘best’ fitted forecasting model using
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)) [15].
2.2.2. Wavelet-based Forecasting (WBF) Model
Wavelet analysis is a mathematical tool that can reveal information within the signals
in both the time and scale (frequency) domains [27]. This property overcomes the basic
drawback of Fourier analysis and wavelet transforms the original signal data (especially in
the time domain) into a different domain for data analysis and processing. Wavelet-based
models are most suitable for nonstationary data, unlike ARIMA [23]. Most epidemic and
climatic time-series datasets are nonstationary; therefore, wavelet transforms are used as a
forecasting model for these datasets [11; 2]. When conducting wavelet analysis in the context
of time series analysis, the selection of the optimal number of decomposition levels is vital
to determine the performance of the model in the wavelet domain. The following formula
for the number of decomposition levels, WL = int[log(n)] is used to select the number of decomposition levels, where n is the time-series length. The wavelet-based forecasting (WBF)
model transforms the time series data by using a hybrid maximal overlap discrete wavelet
transform (MODWT) algorithm with a ‘haar’ filter. Daubechies wavelets can produce identical events across the observed time series in so many fashions that most other time series
prediction models cannot recognize [3]. The necessary steps of a wavelet-based forecasting
model, defined by [2], are as follows. Firstly, the Daubechies wavelet transformation and a
5

decomposition level are applied to the nonstationary time series data. Secondly, the series
is reconstructed by removing the high-frequency component, using the wavelet denoising
method. And, lastly, an appropriate ARIMA model is applied to the reconstructed series to
generate out-of-sample forecasts of the given time series data.
2.2.3. Hybrid ARIMA-WBF Model
For the COVID-19 datasets, we propose a hybridization of stationary ARIMA and nonstationary WBF model to reduce the individual biases of the component models [24]. The
COVID-19 cases datasets for five different countries are complex in nature. Thus, the
ARIMA model fails to produce random errors or even nonstationary residual series, evident from Figure 1. The behavior of the residual series generated by ARIMA is mostly
oscillatory and periodic; thus, we choose the wavelet function to model the remaining series.
Several hybrid models based on ARIMA and neural networks are available in the field of
time series forecasting; see for example [35; 1; 12; 19; 8; 25].

Algorithm 1 Proposed Hybrid ARIMA-WBF Model
Given a time series of length n, input the in-sample (training) COVID-19 daily cases data.
Determine the best ARIMA(p, d, q) model using the in-sample (training) data.
• ARIMA parameters p, d, and q values are selected using the procedures described in
Section 2.2.1.
• Obtain the predictions using the selected ARIMA(p, d, q) model for the in-sample data
and generate required number of out-of-sample forecasts.
• Obtain the residual series (εt ) by subtracting ARIMA predicted values from the original
training series.

3

Train the residual series (εt ) generated by ARIMA by the WBF model, as described in
Section 2.2.2.
• Select the number of decomposition level using the formulae WL = int[log(n)] and
boundary is chosen to be ‘periodic’.
• Obtain in-sample predictions (εˆt ) using the WBF model and generate required number
of out-of-sample forecasts..

4

Final predictions (Ŷt ) are obtained by combining then ARIMA predictions with WBF predictions (εˆt ) for both the training series as well as the out-of-sample forecasts.
Motivated by the above discussion, we propose a novel hybrid ARIMA-WBF model which
is a two-step pipeline approach. In the first step of the proposed hybrid approach, an ARIMA
model is built to model the linear components of the epidemic time series, and a set of outof-sample forecasts are generated. In the second phase, the ARIMA residuals (oscillatory
residual series) are remodeled using a mathematically-grounded WBF model. Here, WBF
6

models the left-over autocorrelations (in this case, the oscillatory series in Figure 1) in the
residuals which ARIMA could not model. The algorithmic presentation of the proposed
hybrid model is given in Algorithm 1.
The proposed model can be looked upon as an error remodeling approach in which we
use ARIMA as the base model and remodel its error series by wavelet-based time series
forecasting technique to generate more accurate forecasts. This is in relevance to model
misspecification in which disturbances in the nonlinear time series of COVID-19 cases cannot
be correctly modeled with the ARIMA model. Therefore, if the error series generated by
ARIMA is adequately modeled and incorporated with the forecasts, the performance of the
out-of-sample estimates can be improved, even though marginally at times.
Remark. The proposed hybrid approach contradicts other mathematical and traditional forecasting modeling approaches applied to COVID-19 data. We choose two completely diverse
models for hybridization, one from classical forecasting literature and another from modern
forecasting approaches.

Five time series COVID-19 datasets for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK
are considered for training the proposed model and the component models. The datasets are
nonlinear, nonstationary, and non-gaussian in nature. We have used root mean square error
(RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), to evaluate the predictive performance of the models
used in this study [17]. Since the number of data points in both the datasets is limited thus
going for advanced deep learning techniques will simply over-fit the datasets [14].

We start the experimental evaluation for all the five datasets with the classical ARIMA(p,d,q)
using ‘forecast’ [16] statistical package in R software. To fit an ARIMA model, we first specify
the parameters of the model. Using ACF plot and PACF plot (See Table 1 we can decide the
value of the parameters of the model. We have also performed unit root tests for stationarity
check and all the datasets were found nonstationary. The ‘best’ fitted ARIMA model is chosen using AIC and BIC values for each training dataset. The fitted ARIMA models for five
datasets are as follows: ARIMA(1,2,1) for India, ARIMA(1,1,2) for Canada, ARIMA(0,1,1)
for France, ARIMA(2,1,0) for South Korea, and ARIMA(2,2,2) for the UK. We employ a
pre-defined Box-Cox transformation set to λ = 0 to ensure the forecast values stay positive.
As the ARIMA model is fitted, forecasts are generated for 10-time steps (5 April 2020 to
14 April 2020) for all the five datasets. We also compute training data predicted values and
calculate the residual errors. Plots for the residual series are given in Figure 1.
It is interesting to see that the error series (residuals) generated by ARIMA are oscillating
and nonstationary for all the datasets. These seasonal oscillations can be captured through
the wavelet transform, which can decompose a time series into a linear combination of
different frequencies. These residual series as in Figure 1) satisfy the admissibility condition
(zero mean) that forces wavelet functions to wiggle (oscillate between positive and negative),
a typical property of wavelets. Thus, we remodel the residuals obtained using the ARIMA
model with that of the WBF model. The value of Wavelet levels is obtained by using the
formula, as mentioned in Algorithm 1. WBF model was implemented using ‘WaveletArima’
[26] package in R software with ‘periodic’ boundary and all the other parameters were kept as
default. As the WBF model is fitted on the residual time series, predictions are generated for
the next ten time steps (5 April 2020 to 14 April 2020). Further, both the ARIMA forecasts
and WBF residual forecasts are added together to get the final out-of-sample forecasts for
the next ten days (5 April 2020 to 14 April 2020). The hybrid model fittings (training data)
for five countries, namely Canada, France, India, South Korea and the UK are displayed
in Figures 2(a), 3(a), 4(a), 5(a) and 6(a) respectively. The real-time (short-term) forecasts
using ARIMA, WBF, and hybrid ARIMA-WBF model for Canada, France, India, South
Korea, and the UK are displayed in Figures 2(b), 3(b), 4(b), 5(b) and 6(b) respectively.
The predicted values for the training COVID-19 cases datasets of the proposed hybrid
model for five countries are further used for model adequacy checking and based on actual
and predicted test outputs, we computed RMSE and MAE for all the datasets and reported
them in Table 1. The performances of the proposed hybrid ARIMA-WBF model are superior
as compared to the individual models for Canada, France, and the UK, whereas, for India
and South Korea, our results are competitive with ARIMA. It is often true that no model
can be universally employed in all circumstances, and this is in relevance with “no free
lunch theorem” [33]. Even if in a very few cases hybrid ARIMA-WBF model gave lower
information criteria values (in terms of RMSE and MAE for training data), we still can opt
for the hybrid model given the asymmetric risks involved as we believe that it is better to
take decisions based on a hybrid model rather than depending on a single one at least for
this pandemic. We produced ten-days-ahead point forecasts based on all the three model
8

models discussed in this chapter and reported then in Figures 2-6. Our model can easily be
updated on a daily or periodic basis once the actual values are received for the country-wise
COVID-19 cases.

Remark. Please note that this is not an ex-post analysis, but a real, live forecasting exercise.
Thus, these real-time short-term forecasts based on the proposed hybrid ARIMA-WBF model
for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK will be helpful for government officials
and policymakers to allocate adequate health care resources for the coming days.

3. Risk Assessment of COVID-19 cases
At the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak, data on country-wise case fatality rates due
to COVID-19 were obtained for 50 affected countries. The case fatality rate can be crudely
defined as the number of deaths in persons who tested positive for divided by the number of
COVID-19 cases. In this section, we are going to find out a list of essential causal variables
that have strong influences on the CFR. The datasets and codes of this section are made
publicly available at https://github.com/indrajitg-r/COVID for the reproducibility of
this work.
3.1. Data
In the face of rapidly changing data for COVID-19, we calculated the case fatality ratio
estimates for 50 countries from the day of starting the outbreak to 4 April 2020 from the
following website2 . A lot of preliminary analysis is done to determine a set of possible
variables, some of which are expected to be critical causal variables for risk assessments of
COVID-19 in these affected countries. Previous studies [22; 30; 18; 5] have suggested that
the total number of cases, age distributions, and shutdown period have high impacts on the
CFR values for some of the countries. Along with these three variables, we also considered
seven more demographic structures and disease characteristics for these countries as input
variables that are likely to have a potential impact on the CFR estimates. Therefore, the
CFR modeling dataset consists of 50 observations having ten possible causal variables and
one numerical output variable (viz. CFR), as reported in Table 2.

countries.

The possible causal variables considered in this study are the followings: the total number
of COVID-19 cases (in thousands) in the country till 4 April, 2020, population density per
km2 for the country, total population (in millions) of the country (approx.), percentage of

people in the age group of greater than 65 years, lockdown days count (from the starting
day of lockdown till April 4, 2020), time-period (in days) of COVID-19 cases for the country
(starting date to April 4, 2020), doctors per 1000 people in the country, hospital beds per
1000 people in the country, income standard (e.g., high or lower) of the country and climate
zones (e.g., tropical, subtropical or moderate) of the country. The dataset contains a total
of 8 numerical input variables and two categorical input variables.
3.2. Method: Regression Tree
For the risk assessment with the CFR dataset for 50 countries, we apply the regression tree
(RT) [7] that has built-in feature selection mechanism, easy interpretability, and provides
better visualization. Rt, as a widely used simple machine learning algorithm, can model
arbitrary decision boundaries. The methodology outlined in [7] can be summarized into
three stages. The first stage involves growing the tree using a recursive partitioning technique
to select essential variables from a set of possible causal variables and split points using a
splitting criterion. The standard splitting criteria for RT is the mean squared error (MSE).
After a large tree is identified, the second stage of RT methodology uses a pruning procedure
that gives a nested subset of trees starting from the largest tree grown and continuing the
process until only one node of the tree remains. The cross-validation technique is popularly
used to provide estimates of future prediction errors for each subtree. The last stage of
the RT methodology selects the optimal tree that corresponds to a tree yielding the lowest
cross-validated or testing set error rate. To avoid instability of trees in this stage, trees
with smaller sizes, but comparable in terms of accuracy, are chosen as an alternative. This
process can be tuned to obtain trees of varying sizes and complexity. A measure of variable
importance can be achieved by observing the drop in the error rate when another variable
is used instead of the primary split. In general, the more frequent a variable appears as a
primary split, the higher the importance score assigned. A detailed description of the tree
building process is available at [17].
3.3. Results
The rationale behind the choice of RT as a potential model to find the important casual
variables out of 10 input variables for the CFR estimates is the simplicity, easy interpretability, and high accuracy of the RT algorithm. We apply an optimal RT model to the dataset
consisting of 50 different country samples and try to find out potential casual variables from
the set of available variables that are related to the case-fatality rates. RT is implemented
using ‘rpart’ [31] package in R with “minsplit” equals to 10% of the data as a control parameter. We have used RMSE, co-efficient of multiple determination (R2 ), and adjusted R2
(AdjR2 ) to evaluate the predictive performance of the tree model used in this study [17]. An
optimal regression tree is built with 7 variables with ‘minsplit’ = 5 with equal costs for each
variable. The estimates of the performance metrics for the fitted tree are as follows: RMSE
= 0.013, R2 = 0.896, and AdjR2 = 0.769. A variable importance list from the RT is given
in Figure 7 and the fitted tree is provided in Figure 8.
12

From the variable importance plot based on the complexity parameter of the RT model
(also see Figure 7), seven causal variables are obtained out of 10 potential input variables
having higher importance. These seven causal variables that significantly affect the CFR
for 50 most affected countries are the followings: total number of COVID-19 cases in the
country (in thousands), percentage of people in the age group of greater than 65 years, total
population (in millions) of the country, doctors per 1000 people in the country, lockdown
period (in days) for the country, time-period (in days) of COVID-19 cases for the country,
and hospital beds per 1000 people in the country. Our results are consistent with previous
results obtained by [30; 18; 5], where the authors suggested that the total number of cases,
age distributions, and shutdown period have high impacts on the CFR estimates. But
interestingly, we obtained four more essential causal variables that will provide some new
insights into the study of risk assessments for COVID-19 affected countries. Out of these 7
numerical input variables, there are four control variables (number of cases, people of age
group > 65 years, lockdown period, and hospital beds per 1000 people) present that can be
managed to fight against this deadly disease. Once these variables are taken care of, the
respective country may reduce their case fatality rate at a significant rate.

Figure 8 shows the relationship between the important causal variables and CFR. In
Figure 8, the tree starts with the total number of COVID-19 cases as the most crucial causal
variable in the parent node. In each box, the top most numerical values suggest the average
CFR estimates based on the tree. One of the key findings of the tree is the following rule:
13

When the number of cases of a country is greater than 14,000 having a population between
14 to 75 million are having second highest case fatality rate, viz., 10%. Similarly, one can see
all the rules generated by RT to get additional information about the relationships between
control parameters and the response CFR variable.

4. Limitations of our findings
We made some simplifying assumptions to carry out the analysis of COVID-19 datasets.
The assumptions are listed as follows: (a) the virus mutation rate are comparable for different
countries; (b) the recovered persons will achieve permanent immunity against COVID-19;
(c) we ignore the effect of climate change (also spatial data structures) during the shortterm predictions. Along in this line, we presented two different approaches to deal with two
inter-connected problems on COVID-19. In the first problem of short-term predictions for
COVID-19 outbreak in five countries, we proposed a hybrid methodology combining ARIMA
and WBF models. In the second problem of risk assessment, we found some important factors
affecting case fatality rates of COVID for 50 highly affected nations. However, there may
exist a few more controllable factor(s), and some disease-based characteristics that can also
have an impact on the value of CFR for different countries, can be regarded as future scope
of the study.

5. Discussions
The COVID-19 outbreaks globally present a significant challenge for modelers, as there
are limited data available on the early growth trajectory, and epidemiological characteristics
of the novel coronavirus have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we considered two
alarmingly important problems relevant to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first problem
deals with the real-time forecasts of the daily COVID-19 cases in five different countries. We
proposed a hybrid ARIMA-WBF model that can explain the nonlinear and nonstationary
behavior present in the univariate time series datasets of COVID-19 cases. Ten days-ahead
forecasts are provided for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The proposed
model can be used as an early warning system to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Below we present a list of suggestions based on the results of the real-time forecasts.
1. Since we presented a real-time forecast system unlike an ex-post analysis, thus one can
regularly update the actual confirmed cases and update the predictions, just like it
happens in weather forecasting.
2. The forecasts mostly show oscillating behavior for the next 10 days and reflect the
impact of the broad spectrum of social distancing measures implemented by the governments, which likely helped stabilize the epidemic.
3. The short-term forecasts don’t necessarily show any stiff decay sooner; also, these five
countries are not going to face any unlike uplifts in the number of cases too.
4. Guided by the short-term forecasts reported in this paper, the lockdown period can be
adjusted accordingly.
Secondly, we assessed the risk of COVID-19 by finding seven key parameters that are
expected to have powerful associations with that of case fatality rates. This is done by designing an optimal regression tree model, a simplified machine learning approach. The model
is very flexible, easily interpretable, and the more data will come, one can just incorporate
the new data sets and rebuild the trees to get the updated estimates. RT provides a better
visual representation and is easily interpretable to be understood by a broader audience.
Quantification of the outbreak risks and their dependencies on the key parameters will support the governments and policymakers for the planning of health care systems in different
countries that faced this epidemic. Experimental results suggest four control variables out
of seven highly influential variables that will have a significant impact on controlling CFR.
Below we present a point by point discussion of the control variables affecting CFR and
preventive actions to be taken by the governments.
1. The number of covid cases of the country can be reduced by enforcing social distancing
strategies.
2. Number of people of age group > 65 years should be specially taken care of and isolated.
3. Lockdown time period can be extended if the country faces a sharp increase in the
number of cases and or deaths.
4. The number of hospital beds should be increased by making special health care arrangements in other places to deal with this emergency due to COVID-19.
