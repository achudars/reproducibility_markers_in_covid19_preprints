Abstract
Countries around the world implement nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to
mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Design of efficient NPIs requires identification of
the structure of the disease transmission network. We here identify the key parameters
of the COVID-19 transmission network for time periods before, during, and after the
application of strict NPIs for the first wave of COVID-19 infections in Germany
combining Bayesian parameter inference with an agent-based epidemiological model.
We assume a Watts-Strogatz small-world network which allows to distinguish contacts
within clustered cliques and unclustered, random contacts in the population, which
have been shown to be crucial in sustaining the epidemic. In contrast to other works,
which use coarse-grained network structures from anonymized data, like cell phone
data, we consider the contacts of individual agents explicitly. We show that NPIs
drastically reduced random contacts in the transmission network, increased network
clustering, and resulted in a change from an exponential to a constant regime of new
cases. In this regime, the disease spreads like a wave with a finite wave speed that
depends on the number of contacts in a nonlinear fashion, which we can predict by

between exponential increase and exponential decrease in the number of new cases,
NPIs can induce a transition to another, previously unappreciated regime of constant
new cases.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has dramatic consequences at a global scale. Until herd
immunity has been reached through vaccination, countries rely on non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) of varying severity, like canceling big events, closing schools, and
shutting down businesses to reduce virus transmission. An important goal of NPI
design is to prevent those contacts in the population which contribute the most to
disease spread while allowing less dangerous contacts. Data from several countries
indicate that the effect of early, less strict NPIs, for example cancellation of large
events, had a profound effect on the spread of the disease [1]. Other findings suggest
that only a full lockdown reduced the spread noticeably [2], although the
implementation of the lockdown varied dramatically between individual countries. For
example, during the first wave, Germany did not implement a full lockdown but
enacted contact restrictions and closure of nonessential businesses so that people were
still allowed to leave their homes and meet in small groups. In several countries,
following the implementations of various NPIs, the curves of cumulative infections left
the exponential regime and entered a linear one, corresponding to a constant regime of
new infections, and an effective reproduction number around 1, see Fig. 1a-c. This is
remarkable, because these countries are quite heterogeneous regarding their
demographics, economic situation and the implemented NPIs. Epidemiological models
that assume an underlying random transmission network predict this behavior only for
a particularly fine-tuned set of parameters, which contrasts with the robustness of the
decline in the reproduction number observed in reality [3–6]. Crucially, this is still true
for detailed compartment models that incorporate the effect of test-trace-isolate (TTI)
efforts, asmptomatic spreaders, or age-dependent spreading based on contact matrices
[7, 8] and for agent-based models that rely on coarse-grained contact networks, for
example created from anonymized cell phone data, which assume a well-mixed
situation on a mesoscopic scale of hundreds of agents [9, 10]. Thurner et al. suggested
that the linear regime of cumulative infections is a consequence of small-world
transmission networks with high clustering [11], see Fig. 1d-i. A similar model was
able to explain the disease dynamics during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003
[12]. Komarova et. al. discussed the power law behavior of the dynamics of COVID-19
spread in the context of a metapopulation model [13], while the power law dynamics
during the hard lockdown in Chinese provinces could be explained by a compartment
model that assumes that the susceptible population was quarantined on a time scale
comparable to the infectious period of the disease, so that the epidemic comes to a
halt quickly [14].

Identification of the underlying transmission network is not only crucial for the
design of effective NPIs, but also for assessing other properties of COVID-19 spread,
such as the herd immunity threshold [15]. The heterogeneous topology of real social
networks is reflected by a small average path length between any two nodes (small
world property), a high clustering in the network (the probability of two nodes being
connected is much larger if they have a neighbor in common) and by a power-law
distribution (scale-free property) of the node degree [16, 17]. Network-based
epidemiological models allow to consider the effects of heterogeneity with respect to
the type and frequency of contacts in the population, i. e. how often people meet and
whom, by representing all agents as nodes of a network and the contacts in the
population by links between these nodes [18, 19]. For example, the spread of diseases is
strengthened on scale-free networks so that the epidemic threshold is reduced [20–22].
Here, we argue that during the period of severe NPIs, like contact restrictions, the
most important feature of real transmission networks is their strong clustering. This
means that because public places and events are closed, we expect that people focus
their contacts on a single group (clique), where almost each member of this clique is
contact with each other. Typically examples for such cliques include households or
colleagues at work. On the other hand, we will neglect the scale-free property of social
networks, because it requires that there are a few people with a very large number of
contacts, for example at events, schools, large private gatherings etc., which are the
targets of most NPIs. We combine Bayesian parameter inference [23] with an
epidemiological model based on the Watts-Strogatz small-world network [16] that
allows to interpolate between unclustered and highly clustered transmission networks,
see Fig. 2, to infer the topology of the transmission network in Germany during three
time periods: February 26 until March 15, before serious NPIs were imposed, March
16 until June 6, when strict contact restrictions were in place and nonessential
businesses were closed, and June 7 until September 15, when most NPIs were lifted.
We show that NPIs reduced random contacts in the transmission network, resulting in
a change from an exponential to a constant regime of new cases. Random contacts
often span a large distance in the transmission network and connect different cliques.
They include, for example, contacts in public transport, bars and restaurants, but also
contacts with relatives that live far away. Furthermore, given the nature of random
contacts, the probability for superspreading events increases when there is a high
density of such random contacts, as they enable the disease to spread to fully
susceptible cliques. Moreover, we show that the reduction of random contacts has a
strong nonlinear effect on the effective reproduction rate and the peak value of
infected people, pushing the disease dynamics into a regime of a constant number of
new infections, see Fig. 1g-i. Decreasing the total number of contacts including those
within connected cliques, on the other hand, has a strong effect if the epidemic
threshold is reached or if the network has a large fraction of random contacts and
weak clustering, see Fig 1d-f. Furthermore, we are able to analytically predict disease
spread in the regime of almost no random contacts by a wave equation where the wave

speed (proportional to the growth rate) c scales as c ∝ k k, where k is the number of
clustered, local contacts. This corresponds to the linear spreading regime. In

summary, our model suggests that NPIs decrease random contacts in the population,
can prevent an exponential disease spread and induce a previously unappreciated
transition to a regime of constant new cases.

Results
Bayesian parameter inference
We aimed to infer the induced changes in the topology of the COVID-19 transmission
network by Bayesian parameter inference. We expected that NPIs lead to a change in
the behavior of people and therefore in the topology of the corresponding transmission
network. We assumed that the transmission network can be described by the
Watts-Strogatz network [16] that can interpolate between a weakly and a strongly
clustered small-world network, see Fig. 2. Crucially, in this framework, we could
distinguish local, clustered contacts within cliques, like households, nursing homes,
businesses, etc. and random contacts outside of these clusters, corresponding to
encounters in public transport, with business partners, friends and family that live far
away and similar. During the construction of the Watts-Strogatz network, n nodes are
placed in a ring topology and connected to their k = 2, 4, 6, . . . nearest neighbors
(local contacts, black lines in Fig. 2). After that, each link is rewired with a
probability p to another random node (random contacts, cyan lines in Fig. 2). We
used the SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) epidemiological model for the
COVID-19 disease dynamics. Agents in the SEIR model were represented by network
nodes such that infectious agents could spread the disease with probability pI to the
susceptible agents that they are connected to in discrete time steps of single days
(Methods, Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 1).
We inferred the model parameters p, k, pI for the time periods before and after the
first NPIs were implemented in Germany, and after most NPIs were lifted again using
an approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC)
algorithm (Methods). We did not infer those SEIR model parameters corresponding to
the disease progression, because they were reported in the literature as 3(1) d to
become infectious after exposure and 10(3) d of infectiousness [25] and kept the
number of agents fixed at n = 3 × 105 , which we regard as a representative sample of
the whole population. Note that we do not explicitly account for the quarantine of
infectious agents, which could be done by a time period-dependent removal
probability, for example. However, we do not do this, because the infection and
removal probabilities cannot be determined independently [6] and there is no reliable
data on the effectiveness of TTI measures to further specify the removal probability.
For the time periods before June 6, for which a large number of infections was
undetected, we also inferred the initial numbers of exposed and infectious individuals

effect of NPIs in Germany to be March 15, as from March 16, NPIs were synchronized
in German states, and schools and nonessential businesses were closed.
We intentionally chose broad, uninformative priors for all parameters, such that we
could compare the obtained posterior distributions with other data sources as a
sanity-check of our approach. To account for the weekday-dependent reporting delay,
we used a seven day rolling average of new case reports provided by Johns Hopkins
University [24], see Fig 3a. Our parameter inference scheme is based on a
minimization of the difference between this average and the number of agents
becoming infectious in the model on the corresponding day. For the initial phase, we
base our inference on the absolute number of infections, while we used the relative
number for the following time periods (Supplementary Information).
We here assumed that all people that were tested positive were also infectious at
the time of the test and that the time delay between people turning infectious and
their test is negligible.
First, we inferred the parameters for the time from February 26 to March 15, since
daily new cases increased rapidly after February 26, while there were almost no cases

in the week before. Our analysis of this period revealed an almost random
transmission network, with a median fraction of random contacts of p = 0.48 (with
95 % credibility interval, CI [0.23, 0.94]), a large number of contacts k = 26 (CI
[22, 32]) and a high infection probability of pI = 0.035 (CI [0.025, 0.061]). The
inference of this unexpectedly high number of contacts could be the result of a
scale-free degree distribution before NPIs were imposed (Discussion). For the initial
condition we estimated that 33 (CI [4, 46]) people were exposed and 81 (CI [32, 118])
people were infectious on February 26.
To assess the changes of the transmission network induced by the NPIs in
Germany, we next considered the time period following March 16. During that time
frame, the NPIs were changed several times, however, the contact restrictions, which
we regard as the most crucial intervention, were only lifted on June 6, which is why we
chose this date as the endpoint of the time interval. As the total number of cases was
computationally intractable, we here used the relative number of new cases as input
for this time period (Supplementary Information).
Our Bayesian parameter inference reveals that the NPIs reduced the number of
contacts in the transmission network considerably to k = 6 (CI [4, 10]). They also
reduced the infection probability of these contacts to pI = 0.02 (CI [0.010, 0.039]),
which matches well with an estimation based on the individual-level secondary attack
rate in the household of 17 % [27]. Crucially, the fraction of random contacts decreased
to p = 7 × 10−5 (CI [10−7 , 0.12]), stopping the exponential growth. Additionally, we

estimated the number of exposed people on March 16 to be nE (March16) = 78 (CI

[31, 147]) per million and the number of infectious people to be nI (March16) = 452
(CI [301, 656]) per million. The fact that during the week before March 16 there were
only 57 infections per million detected in Germany is a hint that a large fraction of
infections went unnoticed at the time, which agrees with other reports [28, 29].
We also inferred the model parameters for the time period following June 6 when
contact restrictions were lifted. To this end, we used the final time point of simulation
instances from the previous period as initial conditions. For the number of contacts we
obtained a median k = 12 (CI [6, 20]) that matches well with reports of the average
number of daily contacts in Europe of 13.4 [30]. The median fraction of random
contacts was estimated as p = 0.03 (CI [0.001, 0.6]), which means it was notably
smaller than before NPIs had been implemented, but larger than in the time period of
strict NPIs. Interestingly, we found that the infection probability was as low in this
time period at pI = 0.02 (CI [0.01, 0.04]) as during the lockdown, which could be the
result of a seasonal effect and of people spending more time outside, which hinders the
spread of airborne diseases such as COVID-19. We inferred rather broad parameter
posterior distributions for this period, due to the generally low number of infections
and large localized outbreaks, leading to a large variation in daily case counts. This is
also reflected in a big variability between single model instances for this time period,
see Fig. 3a (gray lines). For the time periods without strict NPIs (February 26 to
March 15 and June 6 to September 15), for which we inferred a large fraction of

random contacts, the infection probability pI and the number of contacts k were
notably correlated, leading to broader posterior distributions. Figure 3 shows the
model fit compared to the daily case counts and the corresponding prior and posterior
parameter distributions of the network parameters and the infection probability for
the three time periods.

Disease dynamics in the clustered network
To determine the transitions between the linear and exponential regimes of the disease
dynamics, we performed a parameter scan varying the network parameters p and k,
while keeping the disease-specific parameters and the system size fixed at
n = 105 , pI = 0.02. Thereby, reducing k corresponds to reducing the total number of
contacts (local and random), while reducing p does not change the number of contacts,
but restricts them to locally clustered agents (cliques). We recorded the peak number
of simultaneously infected people, because a central goal of NPIs is to prevent the
overload of the health system, and the total number of infected people after 100 days
as a measure for the total damage to public health, see Fig 4.
Importantly, the number of infections could be reduced massively by only
decreasing the fraction of random contacts in the population, while keeping the total
number of contacts constant. As we have inferred the parameters of the transmission
network for different time periods, we could associate them with regions in our
parameter space. If no NPIs had been implemented and people would not have
changed their behavior, more than 40 % of people could have been infected
simultaneously and almost everybody would have been infected after one year (Fig 4,
blue square). The peak of infections was reduced to 0.0002 % by the interventions
(Fig 4a, green point). Lifting the NPIs moved the system back into the exponential
regime, with a projected peak of infections of 1.3 % and almost 10 % of the population
to be infected within one year (Fig 4, yellow diamond). Reducing the total number of
contacts can in principle push the system below the epidemiological threshold leading
to extinction of the disease (see Figs. 1, 4), however the effect is weaker in the regime
far away from the threshold (see Figs. 1,4, k = 10, 12, 14). On the other hand, in the
strongly clustered regime p ≈ 0, increasing the fraction of random contacts has a
dramatic effect: both the peak value of infected agents and the total number of

infected agents increase in a non-linear manner. Preventing most random contacts in
the network (p → 0) hinders the spread of the disease, so that the effective
reproduction number fluctuates around 1, and the cumulative number of infections

increases linearly with time as observed in many countries after the first NPIs were
imposed.

another exponential increase. Shown are contour lines of the mean of 20 independent

break down. In the case of only local contacts in the network, the disease spreads like
a wave originating from the initially infectious agent. This wave-like disease spread
was also reported in real networks, such as the air traffic network [31]. To calculate
the speed of the infection wave, we used a mean-field approximation of an SIR-like
agent-based model operating on the Watts-Strogatz network (Supplementary
Information). We scaled the mean-field equations to continuous time t and space x
(where the distance ∆x is measured as the number of links along the ring of nodes),
and approximated the dynamics by a set of partial differential equations for the
probability densities of susceptible σ(x, t), infectious ι(x, t) and removed ρ(x, t) agents
(Supplementary Information). In particular, we obtained the following equation for
the probability density of infectious agents
∂tt ι(x, t) =

R
I := ι dx, where the integral represents a nonlocal coupling by random contacts. The
equation resembles the Telegrapher’s equation but with a nonlocal coupling by

random contacts and a nonlinear diffusion term due to local contacts. We recover the
classical SIR model for p = 1, as expected. For the regime p = 0, we obtained the

Notably, the wave speed depends on k in a nonlinear manner. Comparing our

regime, see Fig 5.

Conclusion
We used Bayesian parameter inference to quantify the effects of government
interventions in Germany on the transmission network of COVID-19 assuming it can
be approximated by a Watts-Strogatz network. This network captures the key feature
of social networks affected by NPIs, namely the strong clustering of contacts when
people restrict their social life to a small, interconnected clique. Our analysis revealed
that NPIs lead to a reduction in transmission probability, number of contacts, and,
crucially, to the removal of almost all contacts outside highly clustered cliques. In
contrast to standard epidemiological models, in this regime the cumulative number of

infections does not increase exponentially but linearly, with a massively reduced peak
of infections. The dynamics corresponds to a wave-like spread of the disease in the
√
network, whose wave speed c we predicted by mean-field theory to scale as c ∝ k k in
dependence of the number of contacts k. At the same time, the effective reproduction
number fluctuates around 1, irrespective of the wave speed. However, as long as the
epidemic threshold is not reached by the reduction of contacts between cliques and the
reduction of the infection probability, the disease still spreads in the population, which
emphasizes the need for an effective test, trace, and isolate (TTI) system and,
ultimately, a vaccine.
A similar system was studied in a theoretical work on epidemics with two levels of
mixing [32]. There, the authors found that local transmission leads to an increase in
the effective reproduction number proportional to the local outbreak. This in turn
means that a very small fraction of random connections in the population are enough
to enable a global outbreak, which corresponds to the exponential regime in our work.
Several other studies have highlighted the importance of random contacts between
members of different cliques. A recent study which used mobility network data to
show that the spread of the disease is mostly driven by infections at events, which
connect different communities, for example, in restaurants and religious
establishments, further supports the importance of random contacts [33]. Moreover,
empirical studies of the circumstances under which people got infected revealed that
although 46 to 66 % of transmission is household-based (clustered contacts), random
contacts between these cliques are essential to sustain the epidemic, even if only a low
percentage of infections are caused directly by them [34]. A theoretical study that
investigated the effect of different social network-based distancing strategies showed
that the most effective social distancing strategy is to restrict contacts to a single
clique, and to eliminate any contacts between the cliques (random contacts) [35].
We based our parameter inference on the daily count of positive tests. Clearly, this
approach is not perfect: the number of positive tests depends on the testing policy and
the number of available tests, and the date, when the test result is recorded is always
delayed. Another option is the usage of daily deaths, which are independent of testing.
However, it is very difficult to base our approach on the death count, simply because
the total death count in Germany during the first wave and especially during the
summer was comparatively quite low. That means that even our scaled-down system
needs to be intractably large, if we want to reproduce the number of deaths using
realistic assumptions about the fatality rate of the disease. Additionally, the time
distribution between infection and death has a big variance of up to 10 days, as it
varies depending on the age of the affected individual [25, 36], further increasing the
noise in the already low death numbers.
In our model we assumed a Watts-Strogatz transmission network and distinguished
between random and clustered links. Clearly it is possible to use other algorithms to
construct clustered networks, for example the stochastic block model [37], the relaxed
caveman graph [38], or the configuration model with defined clustering [39], to name a

few. We chose the Watts-Strogatz graph for its simplicity and its low number of
parameters, but we expect that one can obtain similar results using other graph
ensembles, as long as they allow for high clustering and overlap of connected cliques.
Moreover, we did not account for the scale-free degree distribution found in real
social networks. It is a result of hubs with a large number of connections potentially
connecting several communities, like grocery stores, restaurants, religious
establishments, etc. This favors disease spread even more than randomly assigned
links and can lead to outbursts of infections (superspreading events) [12]. In fact,
there were several super spreading events related to carnival festivities at the
beginning of the first wave in Germany, for example [28]. We believe that this, at least
in part, explains why our parameter inference scheme finds larger values for the total
number of social contacts k than previously reported [30] for the time period before
NPIs were put in place. However, the fact that our inferred parameters for the later
time periods are consistent with other reports regarding the number of contacts and
the infection probability, reassures us that our assumption, that super spreading was
less important after NPIs were enacted, is justified.
We inferred that lifting contact restrictions in Germany after June 6 moved the
disease dynamics back into the exponential regime. However, the effective
reproduction number remained close to one, due to a reduced transmission probability
of the disease, compared to the pre-lockdown time period. This is likely a result of
several phenomena: first, there might be a small seasonal effect due to the higher
temperatures; second, even after contact restrictions were lifted, there was now a mask
mandate at public places, and lastly, mobility was still reduced by about 20 %
compared to previous years [26] indicating a higher awareness of the virus in the
population. In October, people did spend more time indoors again, and mobility
reduced to normal levels, contributing to a second fast exponential growth of cases.
The German government responded with new NPIs in November, which reduced the
effective reproduction number to a value around one, again corresponding to a linear
regime of new cases.
Our analysis shows that NPIs can reduce the effective reproduction number to one
by eliminating random contacts. However, eliminating the disease does most likely
require to cut almost all contacts between different cliques, for example, by working
from home and not having direct contact with colleagues. In summary, government
interventions should target random contacts and encourage people to form social
cliques that are disconnected from other cliques in order to efficiently prevent disease
spread.

Methods
Model definition
We study an agent-based, discrete-time SEIR model on the classical Watts-Strogatz
network, representing agents as network nodes. The network is constructed by, first,
connecting every node to its k nearest neighbors in a ring-like topology, and, second,
rewiring every link to a random node with probability p, see Fig. 2. Every node i has
a discrete state si ∈ S = {S, E, I, R}, corresponding to susceptible (S), exposed (E),
infectious (I), and removed (R) states.

Disease progression is dictated by Γ-distributed waiting times inferred from
COVID-19 disease characteristics, as these have been found to describe the disease
best [25]. During every discrete time step t, where the length of the time step
corresponds to 1 day, each susceptible agent can become exposed with probability pI
to every infectious agent they are connected to,
P (si (t + 1) = E|si (t) = S) = 1 − (1 − pI )Ii ,

(3)

where Ii is the number of infectious agents node i is connected to. Upon infection, we
change the agent’s state to exposed, and assign a waiting time τE ∼ Γ(kE , θE ) which
we draw from a Γ-distribution with shape kE and scale θE . During every time step,

the waiting times are reduced by 1 day, τE (t + 1) = τE (t) − 1 if τE (t) > 0. Else, the
disease progresses, si (t + 1) = I, and a new waiting time is assigned from another

Γ-distribution τI ∼ Γ(kI , θI ), with shape kI and scale θI . Finally, when τI ≤ 0, the
node is removed, si (t + 1) = R. A sketch of the SEIR dynamics can be found in

Supplementary Fig. 1. We calculate the shape and scale of the Γ-distributions from
the reported mean time and variance in the respective states according to

Note that we did not infer these parameters with our Bayesian parameter inference
framework.
In our model we do not account for an inflow of infectious people by travel; we
instead account for the initial surge of infections by placing randomly nE (0) exposed
and nI (0) infectious agents in the population.

Bayesian parameter inference
We apply approximate Bayesian computation with a sequential Monte-Carlo scheme
(ABC-SMC) to infer the set of parameters Θ = {pI , p, k, nE (0), nI (0)} of our

agent-based model. We always keep the total number of agents fixed at n = 3 · 105 . To

this end, we employ the Python package pyABC [40]. In short, the algorithm employs
sequential importance sampling over generations T = 1, ..., nT . In generation T , the
algorithm draws sets of parameters θi from a given proposal distribution and
consequently simulates data C (i) from the model, until nABC instances were accepted
based on the comparison to observed data via a distance function D(C (i) , Cobs ) and
acceptance threshold εT , D(C (i) , Cobs ) ≤ εT . As the distance function, we choose the

absolute difference between new cases in the model instance C (i) (t) and the respective
reports for Germany Cobs (t),
D(C (i) , Cobs ) :=

C (i) (t) − Cobs (t) .

They are compared to the seven-day rolling average of new case reports in Germany
Cobs (t) provided by Johns Hopkins University [24] to account for the weekly
fluctuations in reporting. Acceptance of model instances depends on the acceptance
threshold T of generation T , which we choose as the median of the distances of the
accepted instances of the previous generation

(8)

When nABC model instances have been accepted, the algorithm constructs new
proposal distributions from the accepted instances to allow high acceptance rates
while decreasing the threshold [41]. In particular, for the continuous variables it
employs a multivariate normal distribution with an adaptive covariance matrix based
on the sample covariance matrix, whose scale parameter is determined by a grid search
with 5-fold cross validation and refitting on the whole data set. We compute the
discrete numbers of initially exposed and infectious people nE (0), nI (0) by rounding
the continuous output of the multivariate normal distribution. We can do this without
a large error as these parameters vary smoothly over a large range. For the parameter
k we employ an adaptive discrete transition that assigns probabilities to all possible
parameter values directly from the frequency of the respective value in the population
of accepted particles with additional random jumps (with probability 0.3) to ensure
absolute continuity of the prior. The process is repeated until the acceptance threshold
is sufficiently low; we especially ensured that the threshold is considerably lower than
the difference between the reported cases and the seven-day rolling average of cases.

1 Bayesian parameter inference
February 26 - March 15
The early phase of the epidemic is characterized by a low number of cumulative infections. We can therefore
directly use the absolute numbers of new infections as input for our agent-based model, as we are always
far away from the epidemic threshold. We choose broad, uniform priors for all the parameters that can be
found in table S1. Note that the probability for random connections varies on several orders of magnitude
p ∈ [10−6 , 100 ] and we therefore infer this parameter on a logarithmic scale. We use nABC = 100 and obtain
an effective sample size of neff ≈ 46.

March 16 - June 6
In the time period from March 16 to June 6 Germany recorded 177652 cases in total. This means that
it becomes computationally unfeasible to replicate the population directly in our model without noticing
a strong effect of the removed (immune) agents. Therefore, we scale down the total number of infections
to our system size and compare the relative number of cases per 300,000 people instead. Assuming our
hypothesis that the NPIs lead to a strongly clustered transmission network holds, we expect a large number
of unconnected communities in Germany in that time period, which we represent as distinct model instances.
We use nABC = 200 and obtain an effective sample size of neff ≈ 105. Our priors for this period can be found
in table S2.

To infer the parameters of the system during this time period we first sample parameters from the posterior
distribution which we obtained for the previous time period, and let the system evolve for 81 days (corresponding to the time period from March 16 to June 6). Next, we change the infection probability pI and
assign a new transmission network based on a new set of parameters p, k. For these parameters, we choose
the same prior distributions as for the previous time period, see Table S3. We use nABC = 200 and obtain
an effective sample size of neff ≈ 164.

2 Parameter scan
2.1 SEIR model
To investigate the disease dynamics in the small-world network, we perform a parameter scan. We vary
the network parameters p, k while keeping the rest of the parameters fixed at n = 105 , pI = 0.02, nE (0) =
0, nI (0) = 10. Our choice for pI during the parameter scan is motivated by reports of the COVID-19
individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household of 17 %. Inverting Eq 3 we obtain
√
pI = 1 − τI 1 − SAR ≈ 0.02.
(S1)
We vary the number of contacts from k = 2, 4, . . . , 24 and sample the probability for random contacts in
eleven equally-spaced steps on the log scale from log10 p = −5, . . . , 0. As initial condition, 10 random agents
are set to the infectious state and the system is simulated until there are no more exposed and infectious
agents. We repeat this process five times per parameter combination (p, k). As output we determine the
peak of simultaneously infectious people
npeak (p, k) := max nI (t, p, k),

(S2)

N (t, p, k) = nI (t, p, k) + nR (t, p, k).

(S3)

t

and the cumulative infection curves

2.2 SIR model
To compare our analytical prediction of the wave speed in the highly clustered network (see below), we define
a simplified SIR model. The difference to the SEIR model is that there is no exposed state, and that the
waiting times for the transition from the infectious to the removed state are drawn from an exponential
distribution with mean hτI i = 10d. For the parameter scan, we initialze the system of n = 105 agents in a
2

ring-like topology (no random links) with a single infectious agent and let it evolve for 365 time steps. We
repeat this process 20 times per parameter k. We then record the cumulative infection curves
(S4)

N (t, k) = nI (t, k) + nR (t, k),
see Fig. 5a. We calculate the linear growth rate from the cumulative infections as


N (tmax,k , k) − N (tmin , k)
c(k) :=
,
tmax,k − tmin

(S5)

where we neglect the initial exponential growth by skipping tmin = hτI i = 10 time steps. We also determine
the maximum time tmax,k until the epidemic dies out for each parameter k so that after tmax,k time steps,
the cumulative number of infections did not increase in any realization of the system

3 Mathematical analysis
Epidemic threshold
We can calculate an upper bound for the number of contacts kc by demanding R0 = 1, i. e. a single infectious
person in a network of susceptible people will effect on average one other person. Using Eq 3 (Main Text)
we can calculate the expected number of infections as
R0 = 1 = kc [1 − (1 − pI )τI ] ⇐⇒ kc =

1
.
1 − (1 − pI )τI

(S6)

For pI = 0.02 and hτI i ≈ 10 we obtain kc ≈ 5.5.

Derivation of differential-equation approximation
In order to predict the linear growth of infections in the highly clustered small-world network, we consider a
simplified variant of our original model, where we neglect the exposed state and assume that the progression
times are distributed exponentially (SIR model, section 2.2 in Supplementary Information). Then we describe
the state of an agent j in our model by a set of three Boolean stochastic variables sj (t), ij (t), rj (t) = 0, 1,
where sj + ij + rj = 1 and sj = 1 indicates that the agent is susceptible, ij = 1 means he is infectious
and if rj = 1 he is removed. We represent the event "agent j becomes infectious at time t" by the Boolean
stochastic variable αj (t) with
P (αj (t) = 1) = 1 − (1 − pI )Ij (t) ,
(S7)
P
where Ij (t) := m∈Nj im (t) is the number of infectious agents in the neighborhood Nj of agent j. Similarly,
the event "agent j is removed at time t" is given by the stochastic variable βj (t) with
(S8)

P (βj (t) = 1) = pR = 1/τI .
During one time step the state of all agents changes as
sj (t + 1)

=

ij (t + 1)

=

rj (t + 1)

=

(S9)

sj (t) − αj (t)sj (t),

ij (t) + αj (t)sj (t) − βj (t)ij (t),
rj (t) + βj (t)ij (t).

(S10)
(S11)

We want to calculate the expected value of the state variable under a mean-field approximation, i. e. we
replace the expected value of a function f (X) of any random variable X by the function evaluated at the
expected value of the random variable, hf (X)i ≈ f (hXi). In particular, this also means that we neglect any
correlations between the state variables of neighboring nodes. We denote the expected values of the state
variables as σj (t) := hsj (t)i , ιj (t) := hij (t)i , ρj := hrj (t)i. For the expected number of infectious neighbors
we obtain

where N is the total number of nodes in the network and p is the probability of a random link (see Model
definition).
Next, we also introduce a small time step length τ > 0 and continuous time t̂ = τ t along with the transition
rates κI := pI /τ, κR := pR /τ . In the following we only consider continuous time and drop the hat for better
readability. For τ → 0 we can approximate the expected value of αj (t) by a Taylor approximation around
pI = 0 as
P (αj (t) = 1) = 1 − (1 − κI τ )Ij (t) ≈ κI τ Ij (t).

(S13)

We can further simplify our system by considering the regime N → ∞, and introducing the spatial step
length ∆x > 0 so that N ∆x = L = const. We can then replace the state probabilities σj (t), ιj (t), ρj (t)
by the probability densities σ(x = j∆x, t), ι(x = j∆x, t), ρ(x = j∆x, t). This allows us to approximate
the expected number of infectious agents in the neighborhood by expanding the terms ι(x + m∆x, t) ≈
ι(x, t) + m∆x∂x ι(x, t) + m2 ∆x2 /2∂xx ι(x, t) to obtain

We introduce the constant Dk := ∆xτ k̃ and can now identify two separate time scales: A fast time scale, with
terms ∝ τ1 which characterizes the disease progression, and a slow timescale with terms ∝ Dk that describes

In the regime τ → 0 we expect the the system to quickly reach a local steady state, so that the fast time
scale terms vanish. We can use this to obtain an approximate value for the wave speed of infections.

Calculation of the infection wave speed in the highly clustered network
To calculate the wave speed of infections we consider the regime p = 0, so that we can neglect the nonlocal
coupling by I(t) in Eq S18. As described above, if we let lim τ, ∆x → 0 with finite Dk , we expect the system
to always be in a local steady state, corresponding to the fast time scale terms being 0. Then, we arrive at
the following equation for the density of infected people
∂tt ι(x, t) = κI kDk σ(x, t)∂xx ι(x, t).

Figure S1. Dynamics in the agent-based SEIR model. Susceptible agents can become exposed, if they are
linked to infectious agents. Exposed agents become infectious after the waiting time τE , and infectious agents are
removed after τI . All nodes are updated simultaneously at every time step t.

If we consider a point far away from the wave front, we have σ(x, t) ≈ 1 (everyone is susceptible), and Eq S21
reduces to the wave equation
∂tt ι(x, t) = κI kDk ∂xx ι(x, t)
