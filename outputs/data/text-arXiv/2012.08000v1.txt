Abstract
Driven by the low passenger satisfaction and fierce competition in the airline industry, carriers
seek to deliver a flawless travel experience as well as exceed passenger expectations to attract
and retain customers. To understand the important dimensions of service quality from the passenger’s perspective and tailor service offerings for competitive advantage, airlines can capitalize
on the abundantly available online customer reviews (OCR). The objective of this paper is to
discover company- and competitor-specific intelligence from OCR using an unsupervised text
analytics approach. First, the key aspects (or topics) discussed in the OCR are extracted using
three topic models - probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and two variants of Latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA-VI and LDA-GS). Subsequently, we propose an ensemble-assisted
topic model (EA-TM), which integrates the individual topic models, to classify each review sentence to the most representative aspect. Likewise, to determine the sentiment (positive, neutral
and negative) corresponding to a review sentence, an ensemble sentiment analyzer (E-SA),
which combines the predictions of three opinion mining methods (AFINN, SentiStrength and
VADER), is developed. An aspect-based opinion summary (AOS), which provides a snapshot of
passenger-perceived strengths and weaknesses of an airline, is established by consolidating the
sentiments associated with each aspect. Furthermore, a bi-gram analysis of the labeled OCR is
employed to perform root cause analysis within each identified aspect. A case study involving
99,147 airline reviews of a US-based target carrier and four of its competitors is used to validate the proposed approach. The results indicate that a cost- and time-effective performance
summary of an airline and its competitors can be obtained from OCR. Moreover, the proposed
EA-TM and E-SA achieved 17-23% and 9-20% higher average accuracy over individual benchmark models, respectively. Finally, besides providing theoretical and managerial implications
based on our results, we also provide implications for post-pandemic preparedness in the airline
industry considering the unprecedented impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and
predictions on similar pandemics in the future.
Keywords: Airline industry, text mining, online customer reviews, topic modeling, sentiment

1. Introduction
The competition in the airline industry has become fierce due to deregulation, and the
proliferation of low-cost carriers (LCC). To sustain in this challenging environment and gain
a competitive advantage, airline companies are striving for passenger satisfaction and loyalty.
They offer competitive fares and provide differentiated services, such as priority check-in and onboard internet, to attract and retain customers. Nevertheless, the airline industry is frequently
ranked low in customer satisfaction [1]. Further, the U.S. Congress’ consistent efforts and
the consequent establishment of the ”Airline Customer Service Commitment” too failed to
ameliorate passenger dissatisfaction [1]. Improving in critical areas of service quality is essential
for customer contentment as well as for enhancing business performance and customer loyalty
[2]. Specifically, identifying service quality attributes that are most-valued by passengers and
meeting/surpassing their expectation for those attributes is crucial for achieving high customer
satisfaction [2].
Traditionally, survey studies were used to understand customer expectations and satisfaction
in the airline industry. However, Lucini et al. [3] criticized such survey methods as the aspects
focused tend to be based on the knowledge of management or researchers and may not mirror the
customer’s actual needs, resulting in an inconsistent measurement of perceived service quality.
Another drawback to these techniques is that they limit the response a customer can provide,
and the expected structured response also distorts the customer’s intrinsic voice [4]. Finally,
many of these survey forms are completed perfunctorily, and some customers even respond
randomly, leading to a fictitious understanding of customer perception, which is more harmful
to any business [3].
With increasing accessibility to Web 2.0 technologies and expansion of social media websites,
more customers express their opinions/experiences about a product or service on online forums
without much restrictions [5]. Even though online customer reviews (OCR) are subjective and
represent a subset of actual customers, they are considered highly trustworthy for understanding a customer’s perspective [6]. Besides, OCR also influences the decisions made by potential
customers [7]. A negative OCR can undermine the company’s reputation and also spreads five
to six times quicker than positive reviews [7]. Thus, businesses are faced with the need to understand and analyze these unstructured review data. Further, these reviews have become widely
available and easily accessible, allowing businesses to effortlessly understand their strengths and
weaknesses from a customer’s perspective [7]. Hence it is presumed that the airline industry
can also use OCR to improve its passenger experience. Typically, a customer review discusses
several aspects of a product/service and has a sentiment associated with each aspect. For instance, consider the passenger’s review given in Figure 1. The first two sentences express a
negative sentiment towards on-time performance and seat comfort, respectively. Whereas, the
third sentence portrays the flight crew in a positive manner. Thus, each sentence in this review
can be classified into a topic and its corresponding sentiment. A topic-wise summary of the
customer opinion (i.e., proportion of positive, negative and neutral reviews for each topic) can
be obtained by aspect and sentiment labeling of representative review sentences.

“...the flight was delayed by 2.5 hours due to mechanical issues. Besides, the economy seats were small and cramped. But the crew and pilots were amazing.””
Figure 1: Sample airline review by a passenger

Since OCR is a vast collection of unstructured text, processing them to gain insights is a
challenge. However, with advances in natural language processing (NLP), many approaches
have been introduced to effectively mine unstructured text [8, 9]. Hence, businesses can process
millions of these unstructured textual data and gain insights from them without having to read
or intervene manually. Prior research has also considered text analytics of airline reviews to
identify the key dimensions impacting customer satisfaction [2–4]. While these works extract
the topics discussed in OCR for a group of airlines, they do not provide a topic-wise sentiment
summary of each airline, which is necessary to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of an
airline and its competitors. Besides, these studies do not examine the prominent underlying
cause of a positive or negative reviews.
This paper aims to (i) identify the key aspects/topics affecting passenger satisfaction based
on thousands of OCR, (ii) automatically classify each review sentence to its most prominent
topic and sentiment (iii) provide a snapshot of topic-wise opinion summary of an airline (iv)
extract business and competitive intelligence from OCR. We integrate three different techniques, namely, topic modeling, sentiment analysis and root cause identification, to achieve
the aforementioned goals. First, an unsupervised ensemble technique based on topic modeling
is proposed for aspect identification and labeling of review sentences. Likewise, an ensemble
opinion analyzer is proposed to automatically detect the sentiment of each review sentence.
Subsequently, these results are combined to obtain the sentiment summary for each topic. Besides, a data-driven root cause analysis is performed to identify the main reasons for customer
satisfaction or dissatisfaction towards each aspect. Finally, the insights obtained are leveraged
to provide managerial implications. Since the proposed approach provides comprehensive insights by automatically analyzing passenger reviews, it is efficient in terms of cost and time.
Moreover, it serves as a decision support system to monitor the changes in customer preferences and enable the airline management establish their priorities, which in turn can improve
passenger satisfaction, airline reputation, customer loyalty, and competitive advantage.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. A review of other relevant studies in the
literature is presented in Section 2. Section 3 provides a detailed description of the proposed
approach. The case study descriptions, along with the results, are discussed in Section 4. Lastly,
conclusions and the scope for future research are given in Section 5.
2. Literature Review
Capturing the customers’ voice is crucial to understand their expectations and perceptions
needed to bridge service quality gaps and satisfy customers [3]. Since this research focuses on
extracting insights based on the voice of passengers, we review some relevant notable works in
this section. Subsequently, we identify the gaps in literature and delineate the contributions of
this research.

2.1

Measuring Passenger’s Expectation and Perception

Conventionally, the customer’s perspective of a service is measured using specifically-designed
survey instruments [10, 11]. Notably, SERVQUAL, a popular multi-item survey instrument
developed to quantify the customer’s expectations and perception pertaining to the five dimensions (reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy, responsiveness) of service quality, is majorly
employed. Moreover, to specifically capture the voice of airline passengers, Bari et al. [12] proposed a modified questionnaire, AIRQUAL, by considering the following personalized dimensions that are specific to air travel - airline tangibles, terminal tangibles, personnel, empathy,
and image.
These survey instruments have been widely used to understand the passenger’s perceptions
and expectations in the airline industry. Pakdil and Aydin [13] developed a 35-item questionnaire based on SERVQUAL dimensions to assess the service quality of a Turkish airline. Their
results indicated responsiveness (e.g., efficient check-in, willingness to help) to be a top-priority
for passengers, while availability (e.g., presence of global alliance and travel-related partner) was
perceived to be an non-essential element of service. Koklic et al. [14] leveraged the AIRQUAL
scale to study the relationship between airline tangibles, service quality, customer satisfaction,
and the intention to recommend and repurchase. They found increased service quality to be
positively associated with customer satisfaction, which in turn influenced the intent to repurchase and recommend. Instead of relying on existing instruments, Kurtulmuşoğlu et al. [15]
developed a customized survey to capture the voice of airline customers to specifically understand their priorities when selecting a preferred airline. Their study revealed low fares, high
reliability (or punctuality), and online booking facility to be the top priorities for customers,
while in-flight meal service and reward programs were found to least impact the passenger’s
preference in airlines.
Though most of the aforementioned researchers utilized surveys/questionnaires to capture
their customers’ opinions, these methods have limitations stemming from their restricted and
predefined nature as enumerated in the earlier section. Owing to these limitations, recent
research has capitalized on freely written OCR for capturing customer’s intrinsic voice and
understanding their expectations and perceptions. While it is difficult to extract information
from OCR, it is crucial as it also serves as a link between prior and prospective customers,
influencing purchasing decisions [7].
2.2

Harnessing Unstructured User-Generated Content to Gather Insights

Many studies have shown the importance of user-generated content (UGC), such as online reviews and tweets, for improving customer satisfaction [16], service quality [4] , brand
reputation [17], and loyalty [18]. One of the frequently used approaches for processing unstructured textual data is topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning technique capable
of scanning a set of documents to identify and extract the hidden semantics that occurs in it
[8]. Different variants of topic models are employed to detect dominant topics (or aspects) discussed in customer reviews, tweets, and other textual data from versatile domains [8]. Latent
semantic analysis (LSA) is one of the first algorithms for topic modeling, which generates a
high-dimensional co-occurrence matrix (or document-term matrix) based on the corpus, and
then employs singular value decomposition to decompose them into topics [19]. Nevertheless,
LSA is not a generative model and uses many ad-hoc parameters. To overcome these limitations,

4

probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) was proposed [20]. Subsequently, other unsupervised topic modeling algorithms, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [21], were proposed
to extract topics using different statistical approaches. Another NLP technique to understand
customer perception is sentiment analysis (SA) or opinion mining, which aims to identify and
extract subjective information in texts such as opinions, attitudes, and emotions [9]. The SA
methods used to determine the sentiment of a sentence/text can be broadly classified into three
types – lexicon-based (uses set of rules and a dictionary of words tagged to their corresponding
sentiment polarity), machine learning-based (uses supervised algorithms to learn patterns from
sentiment-tagged sentences) and hybrid approach (adopts a combination of lexical features and
machine learning algorithms) [9].
Topic models have been used to identify the key dimensions of service quality discussed
in OCR across several industries [3]. Additionally, sentiment analyzers have been employed to
detect emotions and opinions associated with the reviews [9]. Nevertheless, only few studies have
employed these techniques to understand drivers of passenger satisfaction in the airline industry
[3]. Korfiatis et al. [4] mined multiple airlines’ online reviews and extracted 20 aspects of service
quality using the structural topic model. Besides, they found good customer service to have the
greatest positive impact on the customer rating, while delays and cancellations led to stronger
negative impacts. Likewise, Sezgen et al. [2] scraped 5,120 online reviews and extracted key
factors affecting passenger satisfaction and dissatisfaction using LSA. Their analysis revealed
ten and twelve factors associated with positive and negative reviews, respectively. Specifically,
friendliness of staff and ticket prices were found to be critical drivers of satisfaction, while
legroom and flight disruptions were the main reasons for dissatisfaction. Recently, Lucini et
al. [3] identified topics affecting passenger satisfaction using the LDA model and predicted a
customer’s recommendation using the aspects as features.
Few works on airline review analysis have adopted a different approach to detect both topics
and the associated sentiments. Instead of using topic models, Siering et al. [22] used domainspecific words to detect service aspects discussed by the passengers, and lexicon-based approach
to determine the sentiment polarity. Further, they leveraged the aspect-level sentiments and
machine learning algorithms to predict a customer’s recommendation (yes or no) for an airline.
Ma et al. [23] extracted prevalent topics and sentiments from customer tweets following an
overbooking crisis encountered by an airline. Their analysis indicated the overall customer
perception to be negative towards the incident, and vary over time depending on the crisis
management approach adopted by the airline.
Besides understanding the customer’s perspectives, OCR is also used to gather business
intelligence (BI), which involves the identification of both company-specific and competitive
information to aid and improve the decision-making process [24]. Traditionally, BI is majorly
engendered from structured and semi-structured data, but with the increase in availability of
web data and the development of tools to mine them, unstructured data can be effectively analyzed to gain intelligence [8, 9]. This has been the case with the airlines’ industry as well. Xu et
al. [25] mined online reviews of airlines with service failures to identify causes and therefore implement a recovery strategy to improve the airline’s reputation, finance, and customer retention
[25]. Similarly, Hong et al. [26] analyzed online reviews to identify the marketing performance
of individual airlines. Instead of relying on OCR, Hu et al. [27] utilized tweets pertaining to
global airline companies to help them understand their brand perceptions, which is crucial to
strategic decision-making. While most of these research works focused on analyzing UGC to
5

help individual companies identify their strengths and weaknesses, very few studies also focused
on mining the competitor’s UGC to assess potential opportunities and threats (e.g., [4, 28]).
2.3

Research Gaps and Contributions
Based on the review of the relevant literature, the following gaps have been identified.

• Very few works have leveraged text analytics approach for extracting business intelligence
from OCR in the airline industry [2–4, 22].
• Due to the lack of competitor information on the public domain, not enough studies have
focused on competitive intelligence [29], especially in the airline industry.
• To the best of our knowledge, none of the prior studies have used an automated approach for classifying/labeling a review sentence into a topic. Most of them have relied
on supervised learning approaches for sentence classification. The major limitation of
such an approach is that they require large samples of labeled datasets. Therefore, if
domain-specific labeled data is not readily available, such a method is time-consuming as
it requires manual annotation of each review sentence.
• None of the extant studies have implemented unsupervised generation of topic-wise sentiment summary. As the customer’s sentiment towards each aspect may change over
time, adopting an automated approach will provide an efficient and economic summary
of customer perception as opposed to a manual/supervised approach.
• Existing studies have analyzed airline reviews to extract key topics/aspects, but have
not explored the underlying cause of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction within each
aspect. Such root cause analysis is crucial to gather insights on customer perception and
generating actionable insights [5].
This research seeks to address the aforementioned gaps in the literature pertaining to airline
review analysis. Specifically, the OCR of a target airline and its competitors are analyzed to
obtain business intelligence including competitor information. We propose a novel unsupervised
ensemble topic model and sentiment analyzer to automatically classify each review sentence into
one of the identified topics and sentiments. Previous research in text mining has demonstrated
the discriminative capability of topic models to automatically label sentences [30]. However,
such an approach might not provide good classification accuracy. Since extant research has
indicated that an ensemble approach can outperform single classification models [6], we adopt
a similar strategy for topic and sentiment classification of each review sentence. Upon validation, the proposed models are employed to obtain an aspect-based opinion summary for each
airline under consideration to enable the managers of the target airline better understand their
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Besides, to facilitate data-driven actionable
insights, the underlying cause for an overall positive or negative sentiment towards a topic is
analyzed for the target airline. Typically, a root cause analysis is conducted by manually reviewing customer feedback or analysis of survey responses. However, such an approach is not
feasible for OCR due to the large volume of text generated. Therefore, we use bi-gram analysis,
a frequency distribution of co-occurring words in a string, on the subset of positive/negative
review sentences associated with a topic to infer the common reasons for passenger satisfaction/dissatisfaction. Such an approach has been used in prior research to obtain deeper insights
from OCR in industries such as logistics [5] and education [6].

3. Research Methodology
In this research, we strive to derive business intelligence for an airline (referred to as the
target airline), which seeks to understand passengers’ perspectives and improve their satisfaction, by analyzing OCR on itself and its competitors. To achieve this, we propose the research
framework illustrated in Figure 2. First, the unstructured OCR of the target airline and its
competitors are extracted using a web crawler and scraper. For each airline under consideration, the corpus containing all the customer reviews is split into individual sentences and then
pre-processed to facilitate unsupervised learning. A sizeable subset of the pre-processed text is
provided as an input to the topic models (such as pLSA and LDA) for identifying the prominent aspects discussed by the customers and to prepare the models for topic-based sentence
stratification. On the contrary, the remaining text is held-out for extrinsic evaluation of the
model’s capability in sentence classification. Upon completion of the un-supervised learning,
the dominant topics in the OCR are established and the probability of each topic to represent
the individual review sentences are obtained, and this information is used for the discriminative
task of labeling each sentence in the testing dataset with its most probable aspect. The topic
model’s performance is evaluated by comparing the automatically labeled sentences with the
ground-truth (i.e., manually annotated sentences). Subsequently, the sentences are also labeled
using sentiment analysis (SA) tools, and the performance of the approach adopted is evaluated.
While the performance of a topic model is optimized by tuning its hyperparameters, such as
the number of topics to extract , SA tools typically do not need it. SA tools, such as SentiStrength [31], VADER [32], and AFFIN [33] are pre-trained on a large domain-independent
corpus and are therefore directly employed on the held-out review sentences to obtain customer
sentiments. The SA tools employed provide a sentiment polarity score on a numerical scale,
and a cut-off/threshold is determined to convert it to a sentiment class (positive, negative or
neutral) as well as to fine tune the model’s classification ability. The performance of a sentiment
analyzer is evaluated by comparing its results with the ground-truth sentiments. The tuned
topic model and sentiment analyzer are then leveraged to classify the review sentence of each
airline into a topic and sentiment, respectively. Thereafter, the sentiments across all the review
sentences discussing the same aspect of an airline are combined to obtain aspect-based opinion
summary (AOS) of that carrier. Finally, business intelligence is obtained by analyzing the AOS
of all carriers. Further, bi-gram based root-cause is executed on the categorized reviews to
extract more specific-actionable insights. A detailed description of key stages associated with
the proposed framework is provided in the following subsections.
3.1

Passenger Review Extraction and Pre-Processing

The dataset can be retrieved from one or more online travel platforms (e.g., TripAdvisor,
Kayak) that allow its registered users to post detailed textual reviews describing their experiences/opinions with an airline. As customer reviews are prone to noise and inconsistencies,
the extracted OCR are pre-processed by employing different techniques, as shown in Figure 3.
Since a review can discuss multiple aspects and express different sentiment towards each aspect
(as shown in Figure 1), it is first decomposed into individual sentences. Subsequently, a series
of normalization procedures are conducted to ascertain consistency among all the reviews. This
includes spelling correction, standardization of identical words, conversion to lowercase for uniformity, removal of repetitive punctuations and extra white spaces. Following normalization,

7

Figure 2: Overview of research methodology

the stop words (e.g., “and”, “the”, “is”) are expunged from the review sentences as they occur very frequently while not adding any context/value to our models. Every review sentence
is then broken down into a set of words (tokenization) and the words are reduced from their
inflectional forms to base forms (stemming) to enable better semantic interpretations. Finally,
the pre-processed review sentences corresponding to all the airlines are partitioned into learning
and held-out data.

Figure 3: Overview of research methodology

3.2

Aspect Extraction using Topic Modeling

The review sentences in the learning data are used as inputs to topic models, which automatically uncover the latent variables (referred to as topics or aspects) that govern the se8

mantics of the corpus. The topic models assume the corpus containing R review sentences,
C = {1, 2, . . . , R}, to be a mixture of a finite set of K aspects, A = {a1 , a2 , . . . , aK }, where each
aspect (ak ∈ A) is characterized by a multinomial distribution of words [21]. Further, there are
U unique words, W = {w1 , w2 , w3 , . . . , wU }, in corpus C and each passenger review sentence,
r ∈ C, contains a bag of words (B) with word sequence {w1 , w2 , w3 , . . . , wB }, where wi denotes
the ith word in the sequence. During training, a topic model uses a generative procedure to
determine the aspect distribution in each review sentence r (i.e., P (ak |r), ak ∈ A; r ∈ R) and
word distribution in each aspect (i.e., P (w|ak ), w ∈ W, ak ∈ A). Depending on the generative
procedure and statistical assumptions employed in the topic modeling algorithm, both P (w|ak )
and P (ak |r) may change. Among the various topic modeling algorithms, pLSA [20] and LDA
[21] are widely utilized in the literature [34]. Therefore, we use these algorithms for identifying
the topics and the associated keywords. The generative procedure of pLSA, and LDA are briefly
described in the following subsections.
3.2.1. Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA)
Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) models each word in the review sentence as a
sample from a mixture model with multinomial component models and is represented as shown
in Equation (1) [20].

The word-aspect distributions P (w|a) and aspect-review distributions P (a|r) are evaluated
using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm [35] that maximizes the likelihood that
the review corpus (C) is generated by the model and is given by Equation (2). Note that the
parameters φ and θ indicate the words that are important for a certain aspect and aspects that
appear in a review sentence, respectively. Also, c(w, r) denotes the number of times a word w
occurs in a review sentence r.

3.2.2. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
Though pLSA model is effective in extracting topics, it is prone to over fitting and does
not provide an explicit way to process new review documents that aren’t a part of the training
data. In order to overcome these challenges, Blei et al. [21] proposed the Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA), a topic model that closely resembles PLSA but majorly differs in the way

9

it makes statistical inferences. Specifically, LDA derives its topic mixture (θ) from a conjugate
Dirichlet prior. The generative process for each review sentence r in the corpus C is stated
below, where α and β are hyper-parameters of the Dirichlet and are determined beforehand
based on the review documents’ aspect distribution and word distribution, respectively; θ is the
data generating N -dimensional Dirichlet random variable.

To adopt the LDA, it is necessary to compute the posterior distribution of the hidden
variables given a review sentence. While it is intractable for exact inference, other approximate
algorithms can be leveraged to solve the posterior distribution. In this research, we consider
two approximate inference algorithms for LDA, namely variational approximation and Markov
Chain Monte Carlo algorithms (specifically Gibbs Sampling). Thus, two variants of LDA are
considered: LDA based on variational inference (LDA-VI) and LDA based on Gibbs Sampling
(LDA-GS)
3.3

Determining Number of Aspects and Aspect Labeling

The inference from the topic model includes a sequence of keywords arranged in the decreasing order of their likelihood of representing a particular aspect. One of the challenging tasks
is to designate the number of topics (K) to establish without having prior knowledge on the
aspects of service quality discussed in the OCR [36]. The topic model becomes too coarse to
detect the key dimensions of service quality discussed by the passengers if K is underestimated.
On the other hand, overestimating the aspects could lead to complex topic models, thereby
making it arduous to validate and implement. A prevalent statistical technique to select K is
10

to estimate the predictive likelihood of the topic model on held-out data using the perplexity
measure [37]. However, such an approach may not always reveal human interpretable topics,
which are necessary for applications such as topic segmentation [37]. Therefore, we use the topic
coherence score, an evaluation metric that measures the degree of semantic similarity between
high probability keywords in the topic, to determine the optimal number of topics. The Coherence for topic k containing n probable words (w1 , w2 , . . . , wn ) is given by Equation 10, where
P (wi ) denotes the likelihood of finding wi in a random document and P (wi , wj ) represent the
probability of locating both wi and wj in an arbitrary document.

For each topic model, the number of topics is varied from K min to K max , and the corresponding coherence score is calculated. The optimal number of aspects is the smallest value of
K that yields the highest coherence score. Since topic models do not automatically label these
aspects, we use our domain knowledge to label them by examining the relationship between the
keywords associated with each aspect.
3.4

Review Sentence Classification

The sentence-level topic distribution obtained from pLSA, LDA-VI and LDA-GS are used
for the discriminative task of tagging the review sentences to their most representative aspects.
The procedure for classifying a review sentence r using a trained topic model is illustrated in
Equation 11.

Tr =


argmax {P (ak |r) : k = 1, 2, ..., K}

if max {P (ak |r) : k = 1, 2, ..., K} > γ


Null,

otherwise

k

k

(11)

A review sentence r is assigned to the most probable topic only if its corresponding probability is greater than a user-specified threshold γ. Otherwise, it is not assigned to any of the K
topics and is instead categorized as ‘Null’ topic. A threshold is used to avoid classification of
objective statements which do not reflect customer’s perception of service quality. For example, sentences such as “I traveled from Los Angeles to San Francisco” or “I chose to book with
this airline in March” are objective statements and should be classified as ‘Null’ topic for the
purpose of this research. Besides, the aspects identified by the topic models contain only the
commonly discussed themes and thus are not exhaustive. Therefore, it is possible to encounter
review sentences that do not belong to the identified K topics and its crucial to categorize them
appropriately. The provision for classifying a review sentence as ‘Null’ also helps to overcome
this challenge. Note that a high threshold value will increase the accuracy of tagged sentences
but may discard many sentences by classifying them as ‘Null’. On the other hand, a low γ will
lead to increased misclassifications. Further, the accuracy is also challenged due to the presence
of non-coherent keywords associated with an aspect or keywords reflecting multiple topics.
To improve the sentence classification procedure, we propose an ensemble assisted topic
model (EA-TM), a meta-algorithm that combines M topic models, m = {1, 2, . . . , M }, such
that the accuracy achieved is better than the individual topic models. Specifically, a rule-based
approach is adopted to predict the most appropriate topic for a given review sentence. First, the
11

EA-TM seeks to classify a sentence by plurality voting of the most probable aspects identified by
individual topic models, provided there exists a topic that is unanimously chosen by the majority
of the topic models under consideration (i.e., a unique mode). If τr,m represents the most probable topic chosen by model m for sentence r (i.e., (τr,m = argmax P (ak |r, m) : k = 1, 2, . . . , K)
k

and {τr,m : m = 1, 2, . . . , M } is unimodal, then the classification of sentence r by EA-TM can
be represented as shown in Equation 12.
Tr = mode {τr,m : m = 1, 2, . . . , M }
(12)
However, if there is a tie in voting (multimodal) or when there is no mode, the review
sentence (r) is allotted the aspect labeled by the most confident of the individual topic models,
Tr = argmax {P (ak |r, m) : k = 1, 2, . . . , K; m = 1, 2, . . . , M }, provided the associated topic
k

probability is greater than γ.
Nevertheless, both plurality voting and threshold-based approaches may at times fail to
automatically assign a topic, even when the sentence belongs to one of the established K topics.
This could happen when words mentioned in the review sentence do not occur frequently in
the corpus. For example, the sentence “The burger was stale” clearly reflects a topic associated
with “Food/In-flight Meals”, but the keywords generated by the topic model may not include
the word ‘burger’ as it could have appeared only in a few review sentences. To facilitate the
classification of such statements, a topic-specific custom word list, {Lk : k = 1, 2, . . . , K}, is
generated by automatically extracting all the synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, and hypernyms
associated with each keyword identified by the topic model. Subsequently, a score for classifying
a review sentence r to an aspect ak , S(ak ), is computed by counting the number of words from r
that appear in the custom word list Lk . A sentence, not satisfying the proposed condition-based
approaches, is now classified into the topic with the highest score as shown in Equation 13, while
ties in the scores are resolved by arbitrarily choosing one of the highest scoring aspects.
Tr = argmax S(ak ) : k = 1, 2, . . . , K)
(13)
k

If the aforementioned rules are unable to classify a sentence to a most appropriate topic,
then the sentence is labeled as a ‘Null’ topic. In summary, the classification of review sentence
r by EA-TM is discussed in Algorithm 1.

Sentiment Analysis of Review Sentence

Besides tagging a sentence with a topic, identifying the customer perception associated with
each of these review sentences is crucial to obtain an aspect-level sentiment summary. For this
purpose, we use sentence level-sentiment analysis to facilitate the categorization of customer
perception as positive, neutral or negative. Owing to its wide and crucial applications, multitudes of researches have taken place to introduce numerous sentiment analysis techniques.
Ribeiro et al. [9] studied the performance of 24 popular sentiment analysis methods across gold
standard labeled data sets covering different domains. They found three lexicon-based methods,
namely, SentiStrength [31], Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning or VADER [32]
and AFFIN [33] to consistently rank well for datasets involving customer reviews. The overall
sentiment score for a review sentence is typically obtained by combining the individual sentiment scores for each word in that sentence. AFFIN sentiment evaluator has 2477 coded words
in its dictionary, where each word has a valence score ranging from -5 (unpleasant) to 5 (pleasant). It is designed for modern English and therefore can efficiently extract sentiment from

review sentences involving internet slang, web jargons and obscene words. On the other hand,
SentiStrength is a lexicon of 2310 words and provides a scaled sentiment score (varying from -1
to +1) for review sentences. In particular, it is effective for handling sentences containing exaggerated punctuations, emoticons, and deliberate misspellings. Finally, VADER, which includes
7,500 lexical features (words, slang, emojis, etc.) that are specially adapted for social media
data, rates the sentiment on a -1 (extremely negative) to +1 (extremely positive) continuous
scale. Besides using a comprehensive lexicon, VADER uses rules to capture the grammatical
and syntactical conventions used to express sentiment intensity. Yet, the performance of these
three opinion mining methods varied substantially across different sentences owing to differences
in their lexical features and rule-based scoring [9]. Therefore, to obtain consistent sentiment
orientation of the review sentences and exploit the strengths of the three well-performing SA
methods, this research introduces an ensemble sentiment analysis (E-SA) algorithm that combines the predictions from these methods to produce superior results spanning across diverse
customer reviews. The step-by-step procedure for E-SA is presented in Algorithm 2. Once the
sentiment score for sentence r is determined by sentiment evaluator l (νr,l ), the E-SA approach
leverages positive and negative sentiment cut-off values (γ + and γ − ) to convert νr,l into a “positive”, “negative” or “neutral” sentiment category (or,l ). Subsequently, a plurality voting of L
individual sentiment analyzers is used to determine the sentiment associated with each review
sentence r (Or ) as shown in Equation 14.

13

Or = mode {or,l : r = 1, 2, . . . , R; l = 1, 2. . . , L}

(14)

In case of tie or absence of a mode, E-SA uses a three-step procedure to ascertain the
sentiment category: (i) normalizes the scores obtained for sentence r by each l between 0 ) (ii) selects the sentiment analyzer that has the highest absolute value of the
1 and 1 (νr,l
normalized sentiment score (denoted as l∗ ), (iii) establishes the sentiment of sentence r to
reflect the sentiment category predicted by the most confident model (i.e., Or = or,l∗ ).

Evaluation of Aspect-detection and Sentiment Classification

To evaluate and compare the performance of the topic-models and sentiment analyzers
extrinsically, we first compare the results inferred by each of the models with respect to the
ground truth. The benchmark models as well as the proposed ensemble models are each used to
label the review sentences in the testing data set, which contains the held-out reviews that have
not been used for training. Specifically, pLSA, LDA-VI, LDA-GS, and EA-LDA are separately
used to label the aspects for the held-out review sentences, while AFINN, SentiStrength, VADER
and E-SA are individually used to classify the associated sentiment category. The ground truth
is established with the help of human annotators, who are presented with testing dataset as
well as the identified aspects and sentiment categories. In order to avoid bias, multiple human
14

annotators are employed to tag the topic and sentiment associated with each sentence. In
case of discrepancies between annotators, that particular review sentence is analyzed again
to resolve the discrepancy in classification. In order to quantitatively evaluate and compare
the performances, we calculate three commonly used measures in the literature - aspect-wise
precision, recall and F1 scores. Precision (P) is the ratio of the number of correct classifications
to the total number of instances where the model inferred it. It is preferred when the cost of
incorrectly classifying a review into that aspect or sentiment is high. On the other hand, recall
(R) is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to total number of its instances in the
ground truth. It is adopted when the cost of failing to classify an appropriate review into that
aspect or sentiment is high. Finally, the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall,
as shown in Equation 15.
P×R
(15)
F1 = 2
P+R
F1 score is better metric to consider when we seek a balance between Precision and Recall.
The maximum value for all three evaluation metrics is 1, and is obtained when a model has
classified all the instances correctly.

Aspect-level Sentiment Analysis for Business and Competitive Intelligence

For each of the airlines under consideration, the AOS is obtained by combining review sentences on the same aspect and stratifying them based on their sentiment categories. Given
the AOS of the target airline, a topic that has a stupendously positive overall sentiment is
regarded as a customer-perceived strength, while an aspect with an overall negative sentiment
is its weakness. Besides, to obtain the key reasons for customer appreciations and criticisms
pertaining to the target airline, a bi-gram analysis is conducted on the aspects considered as
strengths and weaknesses, respectively. This enables the target airline to develop/plan specific actionable insights. Further, by evaluating the AOS of the competitors, insights on their
strengths and weaknesses are discovered. Such analysis helps an organization better understand
their customer’s perceptions and plan managerial actions accordingly. Besides, it also aids in
acquiring business intelligence – information needed to make profitable business decisions (i.e.
intelligence on strengths and weaknesses of the target airline and its competitors).
4. Case Study
In this section, we evaluate the feasibility of the proposed methodology using a case study.
First, the parameters related to the case study are established and the dominant topics discussed
in the reviews are extracted. Subsequently, each review sentence is classified based on the relevant topic and sentiment, and the performance of the proposed EA-TM and E-SA models is
validated. Finally, the results are analyzed to gain business intelligence for the target airline,
and its theoretical, design, and managerial implications are discussed. The research framework
(e.g., data extraction, pre-processing, model development) was coded using Python programming language, which provides numerous libraries for text mining and NLP, and executed on a
computer running Windows 10 with an i9 processor and 128 GB RAM.
4.1

Case Study Parameters

We considered a full-service carrier (FSC), a major US-based airline operating a large domestic network spanning 242 destinations with over 160 million annual passengers and 5000
15

daily departures yet ranked only in lower the quartile for service quality when compared with
other domestic carriers in the US, as our target airline. Additionally, we considered four of
its competitor airlines, including two LCC carriers (LCC-1 and LCC-2) and two FSC airlines
(FSC-1 and FSC-2). The airlines were selected based on their service similarities and core
competencies. While FSC airlines have traditionally dominated the US market, LCC airlines
have grown tremendously in the last decade, and studying them could give insights into the
service gaps that they might have capitalized. Specifically, LCC-2 had achieved the highest
improvement in service quality in recent years, while FSC-1, FSC-2 and LCC-1 dominated the
domestic market share. Besides, FSC-2 and LCC-1 also ranked in the top quartile for service
quality in the US.
The dataset utilized in this paper was retrieved from TripAdvisor – the world’s largest travel
platform that facilitates booking and provides user-generated feedback [4]. TripAdvisor has over
830 million reviews of 8.6 million hospitality services [38]. Therefore, we capitalized on this freely
available information and extracted all the reviews that were published between August 2017
and September 2019 for the five carriers. The web scraping was performed by employing the
Beautiful Soup library in Python, and the Selenium WebDriver was used to navigate through the
web pages. A total of 99,147 reviews, which had over 398,571 unique sentences with an average
length of 18 words, were scraped. Subsequently, the review sentences were pre-processed using
the functions available in Python’s Natural Language ToolKit (nltk) library. A majority of
the extracted review sentences (∼ 95%) were utilized for unsupervised learning of the topics
and sentiments. Supervised learning was avoided as it requires manual annotation of the review
sentences, which is time-consuming, cumbersome and expensive. However, the remaining 20,000
review sentences were held-out, but only to extrinsically evaluate the discriminative capability
of the topic models and sentiment analyzers. The topic models, namely, pLSA, LDA-VI and
LDA-GS were implemented using the libraries available in python. To establish the number of
topics (K) in each topic model, we varied its value from 5 to 50 in increments of 1 and calculated
the corresponding topic coherence score.
Upon extracting and labeling the topics discussed in the scrapped reviews using the three
topic models, the individual topic models and E-TA were employed for review sentence classification. We observed the accuracy of sentence-level topic classification to be best with a threshold
parameter (γ) of 0.7. Similarly, the individual sentiment analyzers and the E-SA were used
for sentence-level sentiment classification and based on empirical evaluation, the positive (γ + )
and negative (γ− ) threshold values for both SentiStrength and VADER were established as 0.05
and -0.05, respectively. On the other hand, the values of γ + and γ − were set to -1 and +1 for
AFINN.
4.2

Experimental Results

The best coherence value was achieved with 18 topics for pLSA and 23 topics for the other
two topic models (LDA-VI and LDA-GS). Subsequently, the topics were labeled based on the
keywords identified. Similar to Lucini et al. [3], we grouped the topics that had similar keywords/meaning and discarded infrequent ones (i.e., topic distribution probability of < 0.05%).
Finally, we were able to identify 11 meaningful aspects from each of the three topic models.
Table 1 presents the identified topics, along with their most representative words specific to each
topic model. In addition to the expected aspects of service quality, such as seating and baggage
services, the model also identified ticketing services and reward programs as frequently discussed
16

topics in the passenger reviews. Moreover, the priority for each keyword varied depending on
the topic model. For instance, the highest ranked keyword pertaining to the “Ground and Cabin
Staff” topic is “crew”, “staff” and “attendant” for pLSA, LDA-VI and LDA-GS, respectively.

To establish the ground-truth of topics in the held-out dataset, two annotators manually
labeled each review sentence with one of the 11 identified topics or a “Null” topic. Furthermore, the sentiment associated with each review sentence was labeled positive, negative, or
neutral. In order to assess the classification performance of the topic models, they were employed to automatically classify each held-out review sentence to a topic (based on Equation 11
for individual topic models and Algorithm 1 for EA-TM) and the evaluation measures, namely,
precision, recall, and F1 scores, for each topic, obtained by validating the predicted outcome
with the ground-truth, were compared. Table 2 summarizes the performance of the considered
benchmark models in review sentence classification. It is evident that the proposed EA-TM
approach achieved superior discriminative power for all the topics compared to the individual topic models, especially with respect to F1 score. Similarly, these performance measures
for sentence-level sentiment classification were determined to evaluate the capability of the SA
methods, and are shown in Table 3. Similar to EA-TM, the proposed E-SA method consistently
outperformed the individual SA methods. Thus, the results clearly demonstrate the dominance
of the ensemble-based approaches for unsupervised classification of review sentence into the
most prominent topic and sentiment.

and sentiment distribution of the review sentences for the airlines under consideration. It can be
observed that 40% of the review sentences discuss specifically about staff, on-time performance
or seating services provided by the airlines, thereby indicating it to be the critical dimensions
of service quality for passengers. Besides, the distribution of positive and negative sentiments
is balanced across the review sentences. Further, to enable business intelligence for the target
airline, the sentence-level sentiments were categorized for each topic and carrier, and the airlinespecific AOS were established.

Figure 4: Overall distribution of (a) topics and (b) sentiment in the review sentences

Extracting Business Intelligence

Figure 5 illustrates the AOS summary for the target airline from the passenger’s perspective.
It is evident that “Rewards Program”, “In-flight Entertainment”, “First and Business Class
Service”, “Cabin and Ground Staff” and “Food and Beverage” are the aspects that are positively
perceived by a majority of the passengers, and thus can be regarded as the target airline’s
strengths. On the contrary, most passengers have lamentable experiences or grievances on
the following five aspects of service quality: “Seating”, “On-time Performance”, “Ticketing
Services”, “Cabin Comfort”, and “Baggage Services”, and hence are weaknesses. The check-in
and boarding process received mixed opinions from the passengers, thereby indicating scope for
improvement.
To ascertain the underlying attributes for customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction in the target
airline, the aspects identified as its strengths and weaknesses were further explored by analyzing
the bi-grams that occur within the review sentences. Specifically, the frequently occurring bigrams were obtained by analyzing review sentences stratified by aspects. Following Srinivas
and Rajendran [6], a bi-gram was considered to be frequent if it appears in more than 15% of
the processed reviews.
18

Figure 5: Aspect-based opinion summary for target airline

Figure 6 provides the most frequently occurring bi-grams from all the review sentences that
express a negative opinion towards “On-time Performance”. It can be observed that the bigrams such as (“incoming, flight”) and (“wait”, “connect”) are common, and thus we can infer
the late-arrival of aircraft to be an underlying cause of poor on-time performance. Likewise,
other causes of dissatisfaction related to delays can be identified as mechanical problems, weather
conditions, waiting for connecting bags/passengers, and runway congestion. Similarly, it is
possible to deduce the reasons for dissatisfaction pertaining to other weaknesses. The result
of the root cause analysis for passenger dissatisfaction is illustrated using the cause and effect
diagram in Figure 7, where the primary causes are the aspects identified as weaknesses and the
secondary causes are the attributes determined using bi-gram analysis.

Figure 6: Frequent bi-grams from review sentences expressing negative sentiment towards “On-time
Performance” aspect

Passengers feel the baggage services to be inefficient mainly due to loss, delay or damage of
checked baggage. In addition, customers perceive the fee for luggage check-in to be expensive
and also criticize the practice of coercing them to check-in their carry-on items at the departure
gate due to limited overhead bin space. For seating, the most common complaints among the
passengers are due to the lack of space and reclining seats. Other feedbacks pertaining to
seating are on improper maintenance and poor design. Specifically, passengers repine about
the inadvertent pressing of the call button on the armrest and non-functional/missing power
outlets. The underlying causes of cabin discomfort are unsanitary aircraft lavatories, limited
storage space and low cabin temperature. Additionally, the issue of cold temperature is not
remedied with blankets. As far as ticketing services is concerned, the prominent reasons for
dissatisfaction are the costs associated with purchasing and rescheduling a ticket. Besides,
passengers feel that it is inequitable to change pre-selected and prepaid seats without providing
19

Figure 7: Root cause analysis of topics with overall negative sentiment

any prior notification/reasoning. While the experience with cabin and ground staff is described
to be pleasant, their interaction with the ticket agent is perceived to be impertinent. Finally,
improper/obscure communication of ticket policies leads to a series of inconveniences to the
customer, namely, delay/denial of refund, unprecedented automatic cancellation of return ticket
when outbound is unutilized, and unexpected lack of carry-on privilege.
Likewise, a similar analysis was conducted on the aspects identified as target airline’s
strengths to infer the underlying reasons for passenger contentment, and the corresponding
results are summarized in Figure 8. The cabin and ground staff, one of the important assets of
an airline, is predominantly accoladed for it’s staff’s attitude and service delivery. Specifically,
the passengers appreciate the staff for promptly responding to customer requests and keeping them well apprised throughout their flight. Regarding in-flight entertainment service, the
availability of free wi-fi and the collection of relevant movies, TV-shows, and music that caters
to different demographics are the main reasons for positive reviews. Besides, the flexibility to
stream the airline’s media collection on passenger’s personal device (such as tablet and mobile)
and age-appropriate alternatives to keep children entertained also play a key role in garnering
compliments from the customers. Similarly, for the food and beverage services, the complimentary snacks and soft drinks as well as the huge assortment of in-flight purchase options
(such as meals and alcoholic drinks) contribute to passenger satisfaction. Besides, the taste,
temperature, and portion of food served exceed their expectations and enhance their in-flight
meal experience. As far as business and first-class service is concerned, passengers are delighted
about the in-flight service and other amenities such as lounge access. Unlike most passengers,
business and first-class travelers are pleased with their seats as they describe it as comfortable
with ample legroom. Finally, for the rewards program, the privileges given on seating, boarding,
and baggage allowance are valued by the customers. In addition, travelers are also satisfied with
the value of the rewards awarded and the third-party partnerships (e.g., hotels, retailers, car
rentals) established by the airline to redeem the points (or miles) accumulated. Thus, the tar20

get airline can capitalize on these findings and reinforce them to improve the overall passenger
satisfaction.

Figure 8: Underlying reasons for passenger satisfaction

To gather insights on the competitors, their AOS alongside the target airline’s performance
was obtained, as shown in Table 4. The service quality associated with seat comfort appears
to be a common problem for all the airlines under consideration, while cabin and ground staff
provide positive customer experience for most of the airlines. Compared to LCCs, the FSCs are
perceived to be better for the rewards program, but worse with respect to ticketing services (such
as ticket price, refund, cancellation). However, some carriers appear to be the market leaders
for certain aspects. In particular, FSC-1 and LCC-1 are the only carriers that have garnered
overall positive reviews for the boarding process and baggage services, respectively. A root-cause
analysis of FSC-1 revealed five main check-in and boarding characteristics that were commended
by the passengers – (i) seamless, on-time, and quick process, (ii) orderly boarding according to
group priority with strategies to discourage other passengers from blocking the boarding area,
(iii) friendly check-in personnel and polite agents (iv) audible announcements for boarding
calls, and (v) express check-in and boarding for qualified members/ticket holders. Similarly,
a bi-gram analysis of review sentences corresponding to LCC-1’s baggage services disclosed
their two free checked baggage allowance as the major reason for customer contentment. In
addition, passengers also appreciate the timely arrival and the courteous handling of baggage.
On the other hand, FSC-2 and LCC-2 are being appreciated for the on-time performance.
The frequently occurring bi-grams for these carriers predominantly indicate the early/on-time
21

departure as a key feature for satisfaction. Unlike the target airline’s passengers, these customers
rarely complain about mechanical problems, missing connections, or late-arrival of the aircraft.
The negative reviews on delay are mostly attributed to extreme weather conditions, which is
beyond the airline’s control. This could suggest that the airlines performing well with respect
to on-time departures are likely to have (i) robust flight schedules with sufficient buffer times
to offset any late arrivals and avoid missed connections, (ii) periodic structural/component
maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities to mitigate preventable failures such as fuel tank
contamination and worn engine fan blades, and (iii) sufficient reserves (crew and planes) to
handle unavoidable failures such as landing and descent accidents.
Table 4: Root cause analysis of topics with overall negative sentiment

In comparison to competitors, the target airline has a competitive edge on food and beverage services but is disadvantaged by its uncomfortable cabin experience. Moreover, the first
and business class service offered by the target airline and FSC-2 is viewed positively by the
passengers, while both the LCCs do not offer such services as it is not their primary target
market. Therefore, the target airline can capitalize on the insights obtained from AOS and root
cause analysis to strategically focus on the aspects that are perceived poorly by the customers.
Specifically, the target airline can learn from the market leaders to improve their business practices on check-in/boarding and baggage services. In addition, the target airline can adapt the
strategies used by FSC-2 and LCC-2 for improving the on-time performance as it is one of the
important and most commonly discussed aspects by the passengers.
5. Discussion
In this section, we discuss the theoretical, design, and managerial implications of this study.
Further, considering the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on air travel and
the predictions on more frequent global pandemics in the future [39], we also extend the insights
obtained from our results to provide implications on preparing flight operations post a disease
outbreak (such as SARS, COVID-19). Typically, major disruptions in airline history have led
to industry-wide operational transformations, permanently changing the entire industry [40].
For instance, the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 lead to heightened security checks

22

at airports to keep air-travel safe [40]. Similarly, we expect our implications on post-pandemic
preparedness to aid in reshaping the future of air travel.
5.1

Theoretical Implications

This research reveals staff service, on-time performance, and seat comfort as the most prominent aspects pertaining to airline service quality, validating prior research [13]. Moreover, most
of the dimensions used to measure service quality in airlines concur with the aspects identified
by our topic model. For instance, Elliott and Roach [41] used timeliness, food and beverage
services, luggage transport, check-in process, seat comfort, and in-flight service as dimensions
for measuring airline service quality, and these were found among the aspects we extracted as
well. Similarly, findings put forth by another recent study [42], which recognized seat and cabin
comfort as critically important factors, also resurfaced in our analysis. Moreover, Pakdil et al.
[13] used the SERVQUAL model to group passengers’ expectations and perceptions into eight
different categories that directly match with our extracted aspects or associate as sub groups.
In summary, the aspects identified from OCR align with the service quality dimensions provided by traditional methods like SERVQUAL [10], and also with the topics extracted in recent
studies that utilized text analytics [2–4].
Many research studies have shown the significance of customer service to airline passenger
satisfaction, and the current study adds to the depth of knowledge in this area [1, 2]. Sezgen et al.
[2] showed that the key driver of satisfaction for a premium class passenger is staff friendliness.
This concurs with our results as the carriers that perform well in “First and Business Class
Service” also do well in “Cabin and Ground Staff”, and vice versa. Xu et al. [25] reported
that during any service failure or recovery, the primary attribute that decides a passenger’s
satisfaction is whether the airline kept them informed by explaining the failure. Our results
further support this finding, as the bi-gram analysis indicates lack of information as a factor for
dissatisfaction related to on-time performance.
Some findings of this research also contradict the conclusions of existing studies. For instance, Chatterjee [43] reported that customers are more disposed to come across negative
reviews on online platforms as disgruntled consumers are more eager to share their negative
experiences. However, the most discussed topic in our study, “Cabin and Ground Staff”, is
positively perceived for all airlines. Likewise, Kano et al. [44] indicated that meeting customer’s basic expectations like on-time performance may not lead to satisfaction/appreciation,
but failing in these aspects would lead to dissatisfaction. Though the reviews of the target
airline concur to this claim, reviews of FSC-2 and LCC-2 differ as the proportion of positive
reviews about on-time performance is almost double the negative ones, indicating that basic
expectations receive praise as well. Thus, our results exonerate OCR of its bias attributions,
further establishing them as a well-founded source for extracting business intelligence.
Finally, this research also contributes to the literature pertaining to airline review analysis.
Specifically, it provides a fresh perspective on researching aspects of airline service quality by
leveraging unsupervised topic models and sentiment analysis methods for discriminative tasks.
The proposed ensemble techniques achieves superior classification accuracy for the topics and
sentiments, and also enables a robust AOS for each airline. Such automated hybrid approaches
have shown to provide business intelligence in other sectors such as logistics [5] and education
[6]. Also, the results of the current study strengthen the support for capitalizing on bi-gram

23

analysis to infer the root cause for customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction in service industry
[5].
5.2

Design Implications

Technological advancements have been reforming the airline industry and have revamped
customer experience across all stages of air travel. Airlines can incorporate these technologies
into their aircraft design to innovate service and meet customer expectations.
• Leverage Reconfigurable Seating: As indicated in our analysis, common complaints
among passengers of all airlines include cramped legroom, narrow seats, and limited recline. Given that the cabin load factor (i.e., percentage of seats filled with passengers) for
domestic flights is typically around 80%, an astute solution would be to adjust the seat
spacing depending on real-time load. In particular, airlines should consider an overhaul of
seating by adopting the concept of smart cabin reconfiguration, where the seating layout
for each journey is personalized based on real-time demand, allowing the airlines to use
cabin space efficiently [45]. For example, the Flex Seat is a sliding seat concept developed
jointly by Airbus, Recaro, and THK to give passengers extra legroom and space whenever
the flight is not at its full capacity [45].
• Automate Lavatory Disinfecting Process: Though not mentioned frequently in the
reviews, the target airline still has strong negative reviews on lavatory cleanliness. Scheduling more cleaning sessions could ameliorate passenger satisfaction, but it is inconvenient
and may not feasible. A better solution is to automate the disinfecting process after
each use by retrofitting planes with modern self-cleaning bathrooms developed by Boeing,
which uses ultraviolet light (UV) to sanitize all lavatory surfaces in three seconds [46].
Deploying such self-cleaning systems, besides improving cabin perception, also helps the
cabin staff to focus on other in-flight services.
• Retrofit Redesigned Overhead Baggage Bins: Inadequate overhead bin space is
identified to be a common problem among all airlines under study. Especially, basic
economy class flyers are dissatisfied with the lack of carry-on privilege and many others
show resentment as their carry-ons are forcefully checked-in at the gate. Incorporating
redesigned overhead baggage bins, such as Airbus’s Airspace XL and Boeing’s Space Bins,
can help airlines overcome this challenge by accommodating 50-60% more luggage [47].
Besides, these incipient designs can be retrofitted to existing fleet of airlines without
increasing the aircraft’s weight [47]
• Provide Personalized Cabin Environment: As revealed in the analysis, the target
airline’s passengers perceive the cabin temperature to be uncomfortably cold. Since expectations and perceptions of the cabin environment are subjective, a seat-level control of
the cabin environment is preferred [48]. The personalized passenger climate control prototype proposed by ISPACE has proved to provide a more comfortable cabin experience
as it empowers the passenger to control thermal comfort, humidification and ventilation
at seat level [48]. Further, deploying a personalized displacement ventilation system is
also considered efficacious in maintaining optimal thermal comfort [49].

24

5.3

Managerial Implications

The results of this study also provide several implications for practical consideration by the
airline industry. The following list highlights noteworthy managerial recommendations based
on the AOS and bi-grams of the target airline and its competitors.
• Optimize Schedules and Time Buffer: Nearly 20% of all reviews comment on the
timeliness of the airlines, and the target airline has the worst performance in this category.
The competitors (FSC-2 and LCC-2) who performed well in this aspect did not receive
any complains on late-arriving aircraft or missed connections. This suggests a scope for
amending the target airline’s scheduling activity. Further, this is crucial as a delay that
occurs early in the schedule causes a ripple effect that leads to over 70 other flight delays
on the that day [50]. Specifically, the airline should harness the data generated and build
analytical models to optimize the schedule and time buffers.
• Deploy Predictive Maintenance Solutions: A substantial proportion of reviews also
report dissatisfaction due to delays caused by mechanical failure for the target airline,
while such complaints are rare for the market leaders (FSC-2 and LCC-2). Employing
a predictive maintenance strategy, an artificial intelligence-based approach that monitors equipment’s health using sensor data to detect anomalies, can enable an airline to
surmount such challenges [51]. In particular, deploying predictive maintenance solutions
allows for early detection of failures and enables timely pre-failure interventions, hence
removing any unexpected breakdown, unplanned downtime or flight delays [51].
• Introduce Flexible Booking Policy: While an overwhelming majority of the customers
markedly revere the flexible booking option (i.e., no cancellation charge, no change fee,
upfront about costs) of LCC-2, most passengers of FSCs (target airline, FSC-1 and FSC-2)
dread the exorbitant fee on ticket changes and cancellation, and many more are dissatisfied
with the lack or delay of refunds. Therefore, the target airline can adopt policies similar
to that of LCC-2 to gain competitive advantage over other FSCs and also tackle the
near-monopoly position of LCC-2 with respect to ticketing services. Specifically, the
target airline can better prepare to handle flexible booking policy by incorporating the
possibility of cancellation and no-shows in their revenue management models and seat
booking policies [52]. Further, customers are also dismayed by the insolent behavior
of the ticketing agents. This can be avoided by providing the staffs with better task
clarifications, performance-based feedback, and social praise [53].
• Install Accurate Luggage Tracking Systems: Aside from forced check-in of carryon bags, lost, delayed, and damaged baggage are some of the underlying reasons for
overall negative sentiments. Though the target airline offers baggage tracking services,
customers report the information provided to be incorrect and misleading. By adopting
RFID tags in lieu of the regular barcode tags, airlines can address this issue in a costefficient manner and ensure passenger satisfaction [54]. Further, automation of baggage
handling processes at airports, apart from improving on-time performance and lowering
costs, will also ameliorate the overall baggage handling and prevent damage [54]. Finally,
it is also recommended that airlines provide frequent automated baggage related updates
to the passengers’ handheld devices to ensure satisfaction [54].
25

• Automate Passenger Identification and Authentication: Based on reviews, long
queues for check-in and boarding agitates the passengers. The use of blockchain technology, coupled with biometrics, can remove the need to present several documents at multiple
checkpoints and improve on-time performance [55]. It does so by creating a biometricspredicated single token ID that automates passenger identification and authentication,
and serves as the boarding pass, passport, and ID for the passenger’s travel [55]. Hence
passengers can seamlessly transfer through check-in, baggage drop, immigration, security,
and board the aircraft at convenience [55].
5.4

Implications for Post-pandemic Preparedness

After reaching a near standstill due to the COVID-19, airlines across the world are planning
to restart air travel. While preparing the suspended flights for travel is essential, it is also
crucial for the airlines to restore passenger confidence by adopting robust measures to prevent
the transmission of deadly viruses and bacteria. Further, as people around the world accentuate
on “sanitation” and “social-distancing” during the current pandemic, our research reveals the
already existing passenger dissatisfaction with “unsanitary lavatory conditions”, “long queues
and waiting times” and “cramped seating”, establishing the challenge ahead. In such a scenario,
ascertaining that the passenger’s voice is heard and addressed will be the key to regaining
passenger confidence, the biggest challenge facing the airlines today [40].
Incorporating the aforementioned design implications would also prepare the airline to handle a pandemic, where aspects related to “hygiene/cleanliness”, “non-contact/touchless process”
and “physical distancing” are expected to take precedence. For instance, the recommended UV
based self-cleaning lavatory, apart from improving passenger satisfaction, kills 99.99 percent of
pathogens [46]. Further, research also indicates that UV light can both efficiently and safely
inactivate human coronaviruses [56]. Thus, its ability to sanitize, coupled with its touch-free
features [46] could be a revolutionary approach to deal with infectious diseases. Further, the
recommended smart cabin reconfiguration concept can be acclimated to customize the seating
layout [45] and provide the required distancing depending on the type and the severity of a
pandemic. Moreover, apart from maintaining cabin thermal comfort, the recommended personalized ventilation system also prevents the transmission of infections like SARS by reducing the
transport of contaminants [49].
Besides ensuring distancing and sanitary conditions, it is also possible to minimize the
number of human-touch points during air travel by adopting the managerial recommendations
suggested in this study. For example, the biometrics-predicated single token ID eliminates the
need for human intervention [55] and facilitates contactless boarding, thereby making airports
safer during pandemics. Moreover, the automation of baggage handling processes and maintenance systems will reduce worker interventions at the airport, further improving pandemic
safety. Finally, during such dubious times, the suggested ticketing policies and practices can
enable airlines to handle cancellations stemming from both government restrictions and passenger precautions. In addition, we have also derived the following insights from our AOS and
bi-gram results to enable post-pandemic preparedness.
• Facilitate Informed Service Withdrawals: Numerous airlines are fighting against the
current pandemic, COVID-19, by slashing services such as in-flight meals and beverages
to reduce physical contact [57]. While many of these service withdrawals are crucial
26

for pandemic safety, they ineluctably cause inconvenience to passengers. Our research
results will help the airline management anticipate the impact of withdrawing a specific
service on customer satisfaction. For example, in-flight sales are a rare discussion in
the reviews; with this intelligence, airlines can confidently cut-off this service to ensure
pandemic safety. On the other hand, from our bi-gram analysis, it is discernible that
lack of sleep orientated amenities is a significant cause for passenger dissatisfaction. As
a result, airlines can inform the passengers beforehand if withdrawing this service is still
crucial, thereby changing passenger expectations early and alleviating dissatisfaction.
• Provide Targeted Service Alterations: Few airlines are also combating the pandemic
with service alterations [57]. Our research reports the specific aspects of airline services
that are vital for customer satisfaction. Instead of eliminating these important services,
they can be altered to reduce physical contact. For example, our results indicate that
beverage services are crucial to passenger satisfaction. With this astuteness, airline managers can focus on alternatives/alterations before considering the complete withdrawal of
this service. A potential alteration is to replace poured beverage service with packaged
beverages that can placed on seats before boarding passengers. Similarly, in-flight entertainment is vital for passenger satisfaction; instead of cutting down the entire service
due to concerns about handling headphones and contact with high-touch surfaces like
LCD screens, passengers can be notified to bring their own devices/accessories on-board
or sanitizers could be placed next to such surfaces.
• Attract and Retain Premium Passengers: The first and business class passengers
constitute close to a third of the total revenue generated in the entire airline industry [58].
Moreover, in long-haul carriers, this contribution can be as high as seventy prevent [58].
Attracting this elite class would be vital during a post-pandemic recuperation [58]. Our
research shows that access to lounges, spacious leg-room, comfortable seats, and options
to upgrade are essential to this segment. Hence, continuing and improving these services
is crucial to attract this lucrative class and drive post-pandemic recovery.
• Maintain Passenger Loyalty: Downtimes have always been linked with loss in customer
loyalty [59]. Hence, during a pandemic period, airlines must focus on sustaining their loyal
passengers. Award programs strive to improve customer loyalty, and our research shows
that the mileage program and other frequent flyer benefits like priority seating, extra
leg-room, and seat upgrades are vital aspects of the rewards program needed to maintain
customer contentment. Ensuring that these passenger miles and frequent flyer benefits are
valid when the passengers resume flying post-pandemic will help to maintain passenger
loyalty. Further, providing pandemic specific frequent flyer benefits like allocating a seat
adjacent to a vacant middle seat can also reinforce passenger loyalty.
6. Conclusions
As the airline industry experiences fierce competition and also frequently ranks low in customer satisfaction compared to other service industries, it becomes critical to capture passenger’s
expectations and their current perceptions to take measures needed to bridge the service gap and
satisfy customers. To automatically gather company-specific and competitor-related passenger

27

perspectives, this research proposed a novel unsupervised text analytics approach that uses online customer reviews (OCR), an economic and abundantly available information source. Three
topic models (pLSA, LDA-VI, and LDA-GS) were leveraged to detect vital aspects discussed in
OCR, and subsequently an ensemble-assisted approach based on these models were proposed to
automatically classify each review sentence into its most prominent topic. Likewise, an ensemble method with three sentiment analysis techniques (AFINN, SentiStrength, and VADER) was
developed to predict the opinion pertaining to each review sentence. The sentiment associated
with each aspect was then combined to establish the aspect-based opinion summary (AOS),
thereby providing an efficient snapshot of customers’ perspectives. Besides, a bi-gram analysis
was employed to identify the factors contributing to the current level of customer satisfaction
within each aspect, thus facilitating deeper understanding of customer experience and paving
way for specific-actionable insights.
A case study of a US-based airline and its four major competitors was considered to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The topic models identified 11 essential
aspects that were commonly discussed among passengers. The proposed ensemble approaches
for sentence-level topic and sentiment classification performed substantially better than the
existing individual benchmark models, when tested on a manually-annotated subset of the extracted review sentences. The customer-perceived strengths and weaknesses of each airline were
established using AOS, while the common underlying reasons for overall positive/negative perception were revealed by bi-gram analysis. Based on these results, we provided theoretical,
design and managerial implications to aid researchers and practitioners with critical decisionmaking. Finally, from our results, we were also able to derive implications to help airlines
restart service post-COVID-19 and prepare better to face future pandemics.
Apart from addressing the literature gap in the effective extraction of intelligence from OCR
to improve passenger satisfaction in the airline industry, the proposed innovative approach to
capture and analyze the customer’s voice also provides numerous directions for future research.
First, our findings were based on OCR extracted from a single travel platform for a sample of
US-based airlines that have major domestic operations. Future studies can verify the results
by collating data from multiple travel platforms and considering airlines specializing in international routes as well as domestic carriers based in other countries. Second, the extracted OCR
were not stratified based on comprehensive factors (age, nationality, and educational qualifications of the passenger, flying season, demographics, and cabin segment) and therefore could not
provide implications personalized for these attributes. Nevertheless, our proposed methodology
can be applied independently on the stratified OCR to obtain personalized decisions for a passenger type in a specific journey, and future works could validate the effectiveness of such an
approach. Third, the proposed ensemble approaches were only validated on a subset of airline
reviews as it is cost and time intensive to manually annotate large samples for evaluation. Thus,
evaluating the proposed unsupervised ensemble techniques on existing annotated data from different domains (e.g., airlines, hotel, manufacturing) is a future research opportunity. Finally,
in addition to affecting customer satisfaction, service quality has also been an important driver
of perceived value. As the current study does not explore the interconnection between service
quality, satisfaction, and perceived value, future studies could investigate the relationship between the three different factors to gain a better understanding of the predictors of customer
satisfaction.
