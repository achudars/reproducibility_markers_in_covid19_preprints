Abstract
This article is driven by the following question: as the communities reopen after the COVID-19
pandemic, will changing transportation mode share lead to worse traffic than before? This question
could be critical especially if many people rush to single occupancy vehicles. To this end, we estimate
how congestion will increases as the number of cars increase on the road, and identify the most sensitive
cites to drop in transit usage. Travel time and mode share data from the American Community Survey
of the US Census Bureau, for metro areas across the US. A BPR model is used to relate average travel
times to the estimated number of commuters traveling by car. We then evaluate increased vehicle volumes
on the road if different portions of transit and car pool users switch to single-occupancy vehicles, and
report the resulting travel time from the BPR model. The scenarios predict that cities with large transit
ridership are at risk for extreme traffic unless transit systems can resume safe, high throughput operations
quickly.

Introduction

Traffic jams result when there are more vehicles than the road network can handle. After the roads
are fully saturated, the travel times increase with each additional traveler. In fact, the rate at which
traffic grows follows a very predictable pattern. Similarly, when there is a steep decrease in the number
of travelers, traffic can vanish. The travel restrictions put in place to reduce the spread of Covid-19
resulted in a sharp reduction in traffic throughout the US.
As communities begin to reopen, it is important to understand how badly traffic will rebound. Using
basic laws of traffic, we can predict the amount of traffic that will occur in each city given only the
number of vehicles on the road. This allows us to explore “what if” scenarios. For example, it is possible
that many transit riders could switch to a car instead. We want to know how these decisions will impact
traffic.
To answer the above questions, we need to estimate the change in traffic volume caused by the drop
of transit usage, and how this change will affect commute time on the road. With historical data of the
number of commuters using each travel mode – carpool, transit or single-occupancy vehicle (SOV) – we
are able to estimate the number of cars on the road if certain proportions of commuters switch from
transit and carpool modes to SOV, thereby increasing the total number of vehicles. We assume that the
number of commuting vehicles from these modes is representative of total traffic volume. This data is
fit to the BPR model [1, 2] to capture the relationship between traffic volume and average travel time,
allowing us to predict travel time under scenarios where the number of vehicles on the road decreases.
Several studies try to model the congested travel in urban network. Saberi et al. [3] use a susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) model to describe the spreading of traffic jam. Çolak et al. [4] use the ratio
of road supply to travel demand as a dimensionless factor to explain the percentage of time lost in
congestion. The macroscopic BPR model is studied by Wong et al. [5] and Kucharsk and Drabicki [6]
to relate traffic demand and travel time. One or several cities or regions are studied in the above works,
while our work compares the traffic congestion behavior for more than one hundred cities in US, and
make predictions for their travel time under various scenarios of possible traffic volume.
Our main finding is that high-transit cities are at greater risk for increased traffic unless their transit
systems can resume safe, high throughput operations quickly. Figure 1 gives a more detailed look at the

switch to SOV, respectively.

consequences of the shift away from transit for these high-transit cities. The cities most at risk include
San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and San Jose, with potentially 6-80
minutes additional commute travel time per person on a one-way trip. We note that these potential
increases are avoidable. If transit ridership returns in step with trips by car, road traffic will return to
normal. Monitoring closely road and transit ridership during the rebound is critical.
We also demonstrate our method and main findings in a more digestible format in article “The
Rebound: How Covid-19 could lead to worse traffic”1 [7], where interactive plots are included to better
interpret the results.
In the remainder of this article, we will introduce the formulation of BPR model (Section 2), introduce
the data on traffic in US cities (Section 3.1) , and show the forecast result of traffic in different reopening
scenarios (Section 3.2).

Method: BPR model

The Bureau of Public Road (BPR) function [1, 2] is a model that relates the volume of traffic on the
road to the travel time to traverse it. It is widely used in transportation management [8, 9], and network
traffic simulation [10]. While the BPR model is mostly applied on single-road traffic, recent studies have
shown its applicability on urban scale transportation analysis [5, 6]. Thus, BPR function provides us
with theoretical foundation of predicting metro area travel congestion based on traffic volume.
The classic BPR function reads
 β !

τ = τf 1 + α

C

with τ the travel time as a function of N the volume on the roadway. The parameters τf , C are the free
flow travel time and the road capacity respectively. The shape parameters α and β can be fit or assumed
to follow a common choice of α = 0.15 and β = 4.0 [1, 2].
For application at the scale of a city, we interpret the BPR model as a function that takes the total
number of road users in a city N as a proxy for volume, and returns the average commute travel time τ
in the city. In this interpretation, the capacity C should be viewed as the total number of road users that
can be accommodated in the city before average travel times begin to increase. Note that the average
travel time is over all users at all times of the day.
Next we show that the model parameters of the BPR function can be estimated using linear regression.

The form (3) shows that travel time τ and the fourth order of traffic volume N have a linear

regression to find the coefficients τf and γ. This in turn allows us to estimate the free flow travel time

Experiment
Data description

All our data comes from American Community Survey (ACS) of the United States Census Bureau
(USCB) [11], automatically downloaded via Julien Leider’s “censusdata” Python package [12]. The data
records means of transportation to work by selected characteristics. For each metropolitan statistical
areas (MSA) [13], annually statistics of up to eight years (2010 - 2018) is recorded, including total number
of people for each commute mode (2-person carpool, 3-person carpool, single-occupancy vehicle (SOV),
public transit, walk, and taxi/motorcycle/bike/other), as well as the average commute time for each
mode. We select metros areas with at least 4 years of records, resulting in 131 areas in total.
Using the raw data, we calculated the road commute metrics. For each metro area each year, the
mean travel time on the road is computed as a weighted average of carpool and SOV travel time. Total
number of vehicles is computed by converting 2-person carpool, 3-person carpool and SOV into equivalent
vehicles on the road. We also estimated the resulting cars on the road when 25%, 50% and 75% of the
carpool and transit commuters switch to SOV. We note that we are using the statistics from 2018 to
estimate the number of vehicles, which is the latest data available. We do not account in this analysis for
growth from 2018 to present day, which can be considered in an extension. We also note that the mode
share data for taxis and ride hailing is mixed in with motorcycles, bike and others, but this category
constitutes only a small portion of the traffic volume (2% on average), so we omit the influence of taxis
in this study, and do not count taxis in total number of vehicles.
Commute time for all metro areas in the US in 2018 are shown in Figure 2. We see that cities with a
large number of vehicles tend to have higher travel times. But the trends are not obvious, since the travel
time in each city depends on a number of factors, such as the size of the city, the population density, the
average distance traveled, etc.

Model fitting and results
BPR model

To better understand the travel times, we now look at the behavior of individual cities. We show that
for many cities, travel times follow the BPR model as described in Equation (2).
Firstly, we filter out metro areas that do no have strong relationship between traffic volume and travel
time over the years. There can be two two reasons for having no strong relationship. Firstly there might
be error in data collection. Secondly the traffic network might not be saturated yet, so traffic volume is
not the main factor for increase in travel time. In these cases, traffic volume do no have predictive power

times increase with more vehicles on the road.

for commute time prediction, so we chose to filter them out. The filtering is done as following. For each
metro area, we measure the linear correlation between travel time τ and the fourth order of traffic volume
N 4 , and calculate their Pearson’s correlation coefficient and two-tailed p-value. We filter out the metro
areas where Pearson’s correlation coefficient is larger than 0.5 and p-value is smaller than 0.1. Using
this threshhold, 76 metro areas are selected, and 55 metro areas are not included for further analysis.
We then fit the BPR model for the 76 selected metros. Figure 3 shows the result of four example metro
areas. We can see how travel time grows with number of vehicles, nicely following the BPR function. A
complete plot for BPR fit of each metro areas, as well as the estimated free flow travel time and road
capacity can be found in appendix(Figure 8, 9, 10).
Using the estimated free flow travel time and road capacity, we calculate two important metrics for
each metro area:
• Travel time ratio: the ratio of actual travel time versus free flow travel time. A travel time ratio of
1.1 means the current travel time is 1.1 times (or 10% higher) than the empty road travel time.
• Capacity ratio: the ratio of traffic volume versus road capacity. A capacity ratio of 1.1 means there
are 10% more cars than the road capacity.
Travel time ratio and capacity ratio allows us to standardize each city, accounting for the fact that larger
cities tend to have larger capacities and longer commutes, even when the roads are empty. Figure 4 shows
the standardized relationship of travel time ratio and capacity ratio across all metro areas. We see that
all of the cities now follow the same growing curve. Essentially, what we are doing in the standardization,
is looking at the rate travel time ratio increases with capacity ratio, then estimate where the city sits on
the BPR curve. For example, for San Francisco there is a sharp increase in travel time ratio as capacity
ratio increases. This indicates that the traffic volume of San Francisco is way above road capacity. As a
consequence, in the standardized figure 4, San Francisco is the most upper right point.

volume. When number of cars do not excess road capacity, the travel time do not deviate too much free

most upper right point is San Francisco, indicating that traffic volume is way above road capacity for San
Francisco.

Traffic scenarios prediction during the rebound

We now explore what could happen if commuters quickly return to the roads, and transit users switch
to SOV instead. We consider four scenarios, namely when 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the carpool and
transit commuters switch to SOV. We note that the scenarios are created to show a range of possibilities,
not necessarily to predict the actual mode shift. The actual rate at which transit and carpool commuters
shift to personal vehicles will depend on a multitude of factors that are specific to each traveler and each
city, such as unemployment [14] and remote work [15]. In other words, we are not claiming that 75% or
100% transit users will switch to SOV commutes. Rather, the intention is to identify which cities are the
most sensitive to changes in the number of cars on the road.
The predictions for four example cities under each of the four scenarios is shown in Figure 5. Two
main factors determine if travel times will significantly increase:
• Cities that historically have high capacity ratios (many more cars than the network can handle)
are naturally sensitive to changes in the number of cars on the road. Even small changes can have
big impacts. A typical example is Seattle as shown in Figure 5c
• Cities that historically have lower capacity ratios can also see travel time impacts if the number of
cars on the road increases enough. A large change will cause the travel times to increase substantially
as well. A typical example is New York as shown in Figure 5b.
The bar plot in Figure 6 summarizes the travel time increase predictions for metros with medium/large
transit (public transit taking up more than 5% of total commuter). Generally, we see that the increases
are more severe for larger cities, and those that are more dependent on transit – 8 of 10 cities with
the largest predicted travel time increase also rank in the top 10 for transit use. The most extreme
scenario (when all riders switch) is extremely unlikely. But it does illustrate that keeping transit open,
safe, and available will be important to control the traffic rebound. In the less extreme scenarios, we

see that average travel times can increase by a few minutes. This might not seem like much, but it is.
The additional delay is for each trip. When multiplied by the number of travelers in these cities, even
a minute of delay per traveler can easily result in thousands of hours of additional time spent in traffic
every day.

Conclusions

In this work, we gather historical data from the the US Census Bureau, which includes data on the
commute mode and road travel times for cities in the US. A BPR model is used to relate average travel
times to the estimated number of commuters traveling by car. We then estimate the number of cars
on the road if different portions of transit and car pool users switch to single-occupancy vehicles, and
predict the resulting travel time from the BPR model.
To conclude, our take-away messages are:
• When the roads are already saturated above road capacity, increasing cars on the road is detrimental
to everyone’s commute. This is captured by the BPR model.
• Covid-19 cleared the streets in many communities. As we reopen, traffic will eventually rebound.
If transit ridership does not return, travel times will increase, sometimes dramatically.
• Travel time increases of 5-10 minutes are possible in high-transit cities, which adds up to hundreds
of thousands of hours of additional travel time each day
• These increases are avoidable, if transit ridership resumes in step with car traffic.
