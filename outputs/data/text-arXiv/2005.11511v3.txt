The Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model is one of the standard
models of disease spreading. Here we analyse an extended SEIR model that accounts for asymptomatic carriers, believed to play an important role in COVID-19 transmission. For this model we
derive a number of analytic results for important quantities such as the peak number of infections,
the time taken to reach the peak and the size of the final affected population. We also propose
an accurate way of specifying initial conditions for the numerics (from insufficient data) using the
fact that the early time exponential growth is well-described by the dominant eigenvector of the
linearized equations. Secondly we explore the effect of different intervention strategies such as social
distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try
to reduce the disease reproductive number, R0 , to a target value R0target < 1, but in distinct ways,
which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same R0target < 1, TQ is more
efficient in controlling the pandemic than SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be based on
contact tracing and our study quantifies the required ratio of tests-per-day to the number of new
cases-per-day. Our analysis shows that the largest eigenvalue of the linearised dynamics provides
a simple understanding of the disease progression, both pre- and post- intervention, and explains
observed data for many countries. We apply our results to the COVID data for India to obtain
heuristic projections for the course of the pandemic, and note that the predictions strongly depend
on the assumed fraction of asymptomatic carriers.

The COVID-19 pandemic, that started in Wuhan
(China) around December 2019 [1, 2], has now affected
almost every country in the world. The total number of
confirmed cases on July 30, 2020 were close to 17.5 million with close to 686, 000 deaths [3]. One of the serious
concerns presently is that there is as yet no clear picture
or consensus on the future evolution of the pandemic.
It is also not clear as to what is the ideal intervention
strategy that a government should implement, while also
taking into account the economic and social factors. The
role of mathematical models has been to provide guidance for policy makers [4–18].
One of the standard epidemiological model is the SEIR
model [19] which has four compartments of Susceptible
(S), Exposed (E), Infected (I) and Recovered (R) individuals with S +E +I +R = N being the total population
of a region (the model can be applied at the level of a
country or a state or a city and is expected to work better
for well-mixed populations). The SEIR model is parameterized by the three parameters β, σ and γ that specify
the rates of transitions from S → E, E → I and I → R
respectively. In terms of the data that is typically measured and reported, R corresponds to the total number of
cases till the present date, while γI would be the number
of new cases per day. The number of deaths across different countries is some fraction (≈ 1 − 10%) of R [20] while
the number of hospital beds required at any time would
be ≈ new cases per day × typical days to recovery. An
important parameter characterizing the disease growth
is the reproductive number R0 [21, 22] — when this has
a value greater than 1, the disease grows exponentially.
Typical values reported in the literature for COVID-19
are in the range R0 = 2 − 7 [23]. For the SEIR model
one has R0 = β/γ [22].

The two main intervention schemes for controlling
the pandemic are social distancing (SD) and testingquarantining (TQ). Lockdowns (LD) impose social distancing and effectively reduce contacts between the
susceptible and infected populations, while testingquarantining means that there is an extra channel to
remove people from the infectious population. These
two intervention schemes have to be incorporated in the
model in distinctive ways [7, 8] — SD effectively changes
the infectivity parameter β while TQ changes the parameter γ. Intervention schemes attempt to reduce R0 to a
value less than 1. In the context of the SEIR model with
R0 = β/γ, it is clear that we can reduce it by either
decreasing β or by increasing γ. In this work we point
out that for the same reduction in R0 value, the effect
on disease progression can be quite different for the two
intervention strategies.
Here we analyze an extended version of the SEIR
model which incorporates the fact that asymptomatic
or mildly symptomatic individuals [7–9, 24] are believed
to play a significant role in the transmission of COVID19. Our extended model considers eight compartments
of Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), asymptomatic Infected
(Ia ), presymptomatic Infected (Ip ), and a further four
compartments (Ua , Da , Up , Dp ), two corresponding to
each of the two infectious compartments. These last four
classes comprise of individuals who have either recovered
(at home or in a hospital) or are still under treatment
or have died — they do not contribute to spreading the
infection. We do not include separate compartments for
the number of hospitalized and dead since these extra
details would not affect our main conclusions.
For this extended SEIR model we first provide, for the
case with R0 > 1, analytic expressions for peak infection

2
numbers, time to reach peak values, and asymptotic values of total affected populations. These would provide
useful guidance on disease progression. The linearized
dynamics is accurate when the total affected population
is small. We propose an accurate way of specifying initial
conditions for the numerics (from insufficient data) using
the fact that the early time exponential growth is welldescribed by the dominant eigenvector of the linearized
equations. We next discuss the performance of two different intervention strategies (namely SD and TQ) in the
disease dynamics and control. The aim of interventions is
to reduce the reproductive number from it’s free value R0
to a target value R0target < R0 . We study both the cases,
of strong interventions (R0target < 1 aimed at disease suppression,) and that of weak interventions (R0target & 1,
aimed at disease mitigation). Apart from the reproductive number, R0 , an important parameter is the largest
eigenvalue of the linear dynamics, which we denote as µ.
For R0target > 1, we have µ > 0 and this gives us the exponential growth rate (doubling time ≈ 0.7/µ). On the
other hand, for R0target < 1, the corresponding µ is less
than 0 and this tells us that infections will decrease exponentially. We find that, for the same reduction of R0target
to a value less than 1, the corresponding µ magnitude
can be very different for different intervention schemes.
A larger magnitude of µ, corresponding to a faster suppression of the pandemic, is obtained from TQ than that
from SD. An important question for disease control is as
to how much testing is required. In our work we relate the
parameters of the model related to TQ to testing rates
and point out that for TQ to be successful: (a) it has to
be based on contact-tracing and (b) it is necessary that
testing numbers are scaled up according to the number
of new detected cases. Finally, we show that many of our
results provide a qualitative understanding of COVID-19
data from several countries which have either achieved
disease suppression or mitigation.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In
Sec. (I) we define the extended SEIR model. A number of analytic results for the linearized model as well as
the full nonlinear system are presented in Sec. (II). In
Sec. (III), we discuss in detail how intervention strategies such as social distancing and testing-quarantining
can be incorporated into the model, we comment on how
real testing numbers enter the model parameters. We
also present numerical studies comparing different intervention protocols and make qualitative comparisons of
the predictions of the SEIR model with real data on the
COVID-19 pandemic. In Sec. (IV) we make some heuristic predictions in the Indian context. We summarize our
results in Sec. (V).

ables (S, E, Ia , Ip , Ua , Da , Up , Dp ) and ten parameters
(βa , βp , σ, γa , γp , α, νa , νp , r, u), of which α represents the
fraction of asymptomatic carriers while u, r, νa , νp are related to intervention strategies.
We consider a population of size N that is divided into
eight compartments:
1. S = Susceptible individuals.
2. E = Exposed but not yet contagious individuals.
3. Ia = Asymptomatic, either develop no symptoms or
mild symptoms.
4. Ip = Presymptomatic, those who would eventually
develop strong symptoms.
5. Ua = Undetected asymptomatic individuals who have
recovered.
6. Da = Asymptomatic individuals who are detected
because of directed testing-quarantining, may have mild
symptoms, and would have been placed under home isolation (few in India).
7. Up = Presymptomatic individuals who are detected
at a late stage after they develop serious symptoms and
report to hospitals. Here we assume that all individuals who develop significant symptoms are eventually detected.
8. Dp = Presymptomatic individuals who are detected
because of directed testing-quarantining.
We have the constraint that N = S +E +Ia +Ip +Ua +
Da + Up + Dp . A standard dynamics for the population
classes is given by the following set of equations:

The parameters in the above equations correspond to
• α: fraction of asymptomatic carriers.
• βa : infectivity of asymptomatic carriers.
• βp : infectivity of presymptomatic carriers.
• σ: transition rate from exposed to infectious.
• γa : transition rate of asymptomatic carriers to recovery or hospitalization.
• γp : transition rate of presymptomatics to recovery
or hospitalization.
• νa , νp : detection probabilities of asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic carriers.
• u: intervention factor due to social distancing (time
dependence will be specified later).
• r: intervention factor due to testing-quarantining
(time dependence to be specified later). This is a
rate and depends on testing-quarantining rates.
With our definitions, the total number of confirmed cases,
C, and the number of daily recorded new cases F would
be
C = Da + Dp + Up , F =

Note that we include Up because these are people who
are not detected through directed tests but eventually
get detected (after ∼ 1/γp days) when they get very sick
and go to hospitals. On the other hand the class Dp get
detected because of directed testing, even before they get
very sick.
In the next section we will discuss the case where
the intervention parameters u and r are kept fixed, and
present a number of analytic results. In Sec. (III) we will
discuss the case where u and r are time-dependent.

Linear analysis of the dynamical equations

Since at early times S ≈ N and all the other populations E, Ia , Ip , Da , Dp , Ua , Up  N , one can perform a

linearization of the above equations. This tells us about
the early time growth of the pandemic, in particular the
exponential growth rate. Let us define new variables to
characterize the linear regime: x1 = S − N, x2 = E, x3 =
Ia , x4 = Ip , x5 = Ua , x6 = Da , x7 = Up , x8 = Dp . At
early times when xi << N , the dynamics is captured by
linear equations

where β̃a = uβa , β̃p = uβp , γ̃a = γa + rνa , γ̃p = γp + rνp .
For the present we ignore the time dependence of the SD
factor u and the TQ factor r. The matrix has 5 zero
eigenvalues while the 3 non-vanishing ones are given by
the roots of the following cubic equation for λ:

+σγ̃a γ̃p (1 − R0 ) = 0,

is the expected form for the reproductive number for the
disease. One can intuitively see this as follows. The reproductive number is the average number of secondary
infection from one infected individual at the initial phase
of the outbreak. In our model, an infected individual may
either be asymptomatic or presymptomatic with probabilities α or (1 − α) respectively. On average, While an
asymptomatic individual infects β¯a /γ¯a number of people, a presymptomatic carrier infects β¯p /γ¯p number of
people. Consequently the expected number of secondary
infection from an arbitrarily chosen infected individual
will be R0 with expression given by Eq. (14). Noting the
fact that Q < R0 , it follows that the condition for at
least one positive eigenvalue is
R0 > 1.

(15)

4
We denote the largest eigenvalue by µ and note that this
is uniquely related to the reproductive number R0 by
Eq. (13). At early times the number of cases detected
would grow as ∼ eµt . For R0 ≈ 1, we expect that the
largest eigenvalue is close to zero and, after neglecting the
λ3 and λ2 terms in Eq. (13), we can read off the value as
µ≈

σ(R0 − 1)
.
1 + σ(γ̃a−1 + γ̃p−1 )(1 − Q)

(16)

Initial conditions: We discuss here the fact that all
initial conditions (which satisfy the condition S(0) ≈ N )
quickly move along the direction of the dominant eigenvector and how this provides us a way to choose the correct initial conditions from the knowledge of one variable
(e.g confirmed cases) at an early time. We denote the
right and left eigenvectors corresponding to an eigenvalue
λq by φq (i) and χq (i) respectively. The largest eigenvalue is denoted by µ with corresponding right and left
eigenvectors φm (i) and χm (i) respectively. The vector
X = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , x6 , x7 , x8 ) can be written as [27]
X
xi (t) =
cq eλq t φq (i)

FIG. 2. Role of initial conditions: Plot showing I(t),
for a fixed population of size N = 107 , with 5 very different initial conditions : (1)E(0) = 100, Ia (0) = 0, Ip (0) = 0,

where the coefficients cq are determined by putting t = 0
and then taking the inner product with the

where the second last line is true at sufficiently large
times when only one eigenvalue µ dominates. This proves
that the direction of the vector X is independent of initial conditions. In particular, using the explicit form of
the dominant eigenvector we find the following relation
in the growing phase of the pandemic:
φm (3)
α(µ + γ̃p )
Ia (t)

Ip (t)
φm (4)
(1 − α)(µ + γ̃a )
Let us consider the initial condition X
(−, 0, 0, , 0, 0, 0, 0) so that (noting that χm (1) = 0)
xi (t) ≈ φm (i)χm (4)eµt = ai eµt ,

(19)
=
(20)

where ai = φm (i)χm (4). At a sufficiently large time tl
(but still in the very early phase of the pandemic) we
equate the observed confirmed number C0 on some day
to x6 (tl ) + x7 (tl ) + x8 (tl ) which therefore gives us the
relation
eµtl =

C0
.
a6 + a7 + a8

(21)

This then tells us that we should start with the following
initial conditions, (now counting time t = 0 from the day
of the observation C0 ):
xi (0) =

φm (i)
C0 .
φm (6) + φm (7) + φm (8)

(22)

The crucial point is that the leading eigenvector fixes
the direction of the growth and then knowledge of linear combination fixes all the other coordinates. Thus,
independent of initial conditions, the vector describing
all the system variables quickly points along the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue [15, 28]. Hence if we know any one variable (or
a linear combination of all the variables) at sufficiently
large times in the growing phase, then the full vector is
completely specified. This leads to an accurate way of
specifying initial conditions for the numerics (from insufficient data) and will help in reducing the number of
fitting parameters in modeling studies, thereby increasing their accuracy in predicting.
This fact also implies that different initial conditions
(such as different seed infections) will only cause a temporal shift of the observed evolution. This also means
that trajectories for different initial conditions are identical up to a time translation. If one uses identical parameters and intervention strategies, then all countries
should follow the same trajectory provided they start
with the same value for the normalized fraction of confirmed new cases F0 /N . We illustrate this idea, for the
extended SEIR dynamics, in Fig. 2 where we show a plot
of I(t) = Ia (t) + Ip (t) for 5 different initial conditions.
The inset shows a collapse of all the trajectories after
an appropriate time translation of the different trajecto-

5
moment let us assume that u and r do not have any time
dependence. We also assume that Ua (0) = 0, Up (0) =
0, Da (0) = 0, Dp (0) = 0 and S(0) ≈ N . Then solving
Eq. (1), we get
S̄ = N e−

dt[β̃a Ia (t)+β̃p Ip (t)]/N

.

(23)

where β̃a and β̃p are given after Eq. (13). Adding Eqs. (5)
and (6) and then multiplying both sides by β̃a /γ̃a we get
β̃a dRa
γ̃a dt = β̃a Ia where Ra = Ua + Da . Similarly, we also
β̃ dR

get γ̃pp dtp = β̃p Ip where Rp = Up + Dp . Plugging these
two equations into Eq. (23) then gives
S̄ = N e−[(β̃a /γ̃a )R̄a /N +(β̃p /γ̃p )R̄p /N ] .

(24)

Next we note that (d/dt)(Ia +Ra ) = ασE and (d/dt)(Ip +
Rp ) = (1 − α)σE. Hence, for the initial condition
Ia = Ip = Ra = Rp = 0, we find that the ratio
[Ia (t) + Ra (t)]/[Ip (t) + Rp (t)] = α/(1 − α) at all times.
Since at large times Ia,p → 0, this means that the asymptotic values of Ra and Rp are given by
R¯a = αR̄, and R̄p = (1 − α)R̄.

(25)

Using this in Eq. (24), noting that S̄ + R̄ = N and defining x̄ = R̄/N , we then get the following simple equation
that determines the asymptotic total affected population:

population, with the time axis shifted so that every country
starts with the same normalized value. Data from [29]

ries. Can we see a similar collapse of the real data for
different countries (after normalizing by the respective
populations and with appropriate time translation of the
data) ? In Fig. 3 we plot the data with this normalization
and initial condition and see a rough collapse for several
countries. The differences can be attributed to different
parameter values and different control strategies in different countries. We notice in particular that three of
the Asian countries (India, Pakistan, Indonesia) follow a
distinctly different trajectory.

B.

1 − x̄ = e−R0 x̄ ,
β̃

where R0 = α β̃γ̃aa + (1 − α) γ̃pp is the reproductive number
as stated earlier. We note that Eq. (26) has a non-zero
solution only when R0 > 1. In Fig. (4) we show the
dependence of x̄ on R0 , obtained from a numerical solution of Eq. (26). For the simple SIR model the result
of Eq. (26) is well known [25], here we show that this is
valid for an extended model as well generally. This computation of the asymptotic population can be straightforwardly extended to a more general model where one can
have arbitrary number of compartments for the infected
and recovered populations.
The asymptotic population of all four compartments
within R are thus given by
R̄a = αR̄, R̄p = (1 − α)R̄

Final affected population

Let us define the asymptotic populations (i.e the populations at very long times) in the different compartments
as Ūa , D̄a , Ūp , D̄p , and let R̄a = Ūa + D̄a , R̄p = Ūp + D̄p ,
R̄ = R̄a + R̄p . The total population that would eventually be affected by the disease (and either recover or
die) is given by R̄ and would have developed immunity.
A fraction Ūa (see below) would be undetected and uncounted.
It is possible to compute the final affected population
R̄ from the dynamical equations in Eqs. 1 - 8. For the

Peak infections and the time to reach the peak

The peak infection numbers and the time at which the
peak occurs are two important quantities that one would
like to know during a pandemic. Here we provide heuristic analytic formulas for these, which are derived after
making some simple physical assumptions.

The parameters used are βa = 0.33, βp = 0.5, σ = 0.33, γa = 0.125, γp = 0.083, r = 0.0 and u = 1.0. We also plot the quantity

Eqs. (34)-(37) are σ = 1/3, γe = 0.1 for all values of R0 and β = R0 γe . The dominant eigenvalue µ are computed using the
linearised version of Eqs. (34)-(37) and slopes are obtained from the data.

We start with the evolution equations for the infected

Let us assume that in comparison to the time scale of
the pandemic, E, Ia and Ip all peak at roughly the same

time say tm , and let us indicate by E (m) , Ia , Ip the
respective peak values. We then obtain

(37)

Here, γe is given by Eq. (31) and βe = R0 γe where the
reproductive number R0 is given by Eq. (14). Assuming
the initial conditions: S(0) ≈ N, R(0) = 0, we can solve
Eqs. (34,37) to get:
S = N e−R0 R/N .

(38)

At the peak, our assumption of dE/dt = 0 gives from
Eq. (35), S (m) /N = σE (m) /(βe I (m) ) = γe /βe = R0−1
[using Eq. (30)]. The peak value R(m) is then given
from Eq. (38) by R(m) /N = R0−1 ln(R0 ). Finally, using
Eq. (30) and the fact that S/N + E/N + I/N + R/N = 1

For somewhat simpler models it is possible to obtain an
analytical estimate of the peak size [16] and for the time,
t(m) , required to reach the infection peak [26]. In our
case we estimate t(m) by noting that the linearized dynamics is approximately valid (see previous section) up
to the time I(t) reaches its peak I (m) . Hence we write

able form is one where u(t) has the constant value (= 1)
before the beginning of any interventions, and then from
time ton it changes to a value 0 < ul < 1, over a characteristic time scale ∼ tw . Thus we take a form
u(t) = 1 t < ton ,
= ul + (1 − ul )e−(t−ton )/tw ,

t > ton .

(41)

The number ul indicates the lowering of social contacts.
Testing-quarantining (TQ): We expect that testing
and quarantining will take out individuals from the infectious population and this is captured by the terms
rνa Ia and rνp Ip in the dynamical equations. A reasonable choice for the TQ function is perhaps to take
FIG. 5. Comparison of values of Ia , Ip , I obtained from direct
numerics with those from the approximate assumed forms,
Iath , Ipth from Eq. (33) (I taken from the numerics). We also
plot the predicted peak value of I (m) . The parameters in the
numerics were taken as N = 107 , α = 0.67, βa = 0.333, βp =
0.5, γa = 1/8, γp = 1/12, σ = 1/3, νa = 1/3, νp = 1/2, u =
1, r = 0.5, which gives R0 = 1.26, µ = 0.039. We see in this
case the assumption is valid to a high degree of accuracy.
(m)

I (m) = I0 eµ(t −t0 ) , where I0 = I(t = t0 ) is the infection number at some early time (but already in the
exponentially growing regime). Hence we get

with I (m) given by Eq. (39) and c is a constant that
depends on initial conditions and model parameters.
In Fig. (4), we provide a numerical verification of the
results in Eq. (39) and Eq. (40) by solving the extended
SEIR equations numerically. One of the main assumptions required for the proof is the validity of Eqs. (33). In
Fig. (5) we check this assumption in a numerical example
with a particular parameter set.

III.

INTERVENTIONS: SOCIAL DISTANCING
AND TESTING-QUARANTINING

We next consider the effect of different intervetion
strategies which are incorporated into the extended
SEIR dynamical equations, (1)-(8), through the parameters u and r which we will now make time-dependent.
We discuss here the choices of the intervention functions u and r. Note that u is a dimensionless number
quantifying the level of social contacts, while r is a rate
which, as we will see, is closely related to the testing rate.
Social distancing (SD): We multiply the constant factors βa,p by the time dependent function, u(t), the “lockdown” function that incorporates the effect of social distancing, i.e reducing contacts between people. A reason-

r(t) = 0 t < t0on ,
0

0

= rl − rl e−(t−ton )/tw ,

t > t0on .

(42)

where one needs a final rate rl > 0. In general the time
at which the TQ begins to be implemented t0on and the
time required for it to be effective t0w could be different
from those used for SD.
A useful quantity to characterize the system with interventions is the time-dependent effective reproductive
number given by
R0eff (t) = α

u(t)βa
u(t)βp
+ (1 − α)
.
γa + r(t)νa
γp + r(t)νp

(43)

At long times this goes to the targeted reproduction number
R0target = R0eff (t → ∞) = α

u l βp
ul βa
+ (1 − α)
.
γa + rl νa
γp + rl νp
(44)

The time scale for the intervention target to be achieved
is given by tw and t0w .
Relation of the TQ function r(t) to the number of
tests done per day: Let us suppose that the number
of tests per person per day is given by Tr . We show
in Fig. (6) the data for the number of tests per 1000
people per day across a set of countries and see that this
is around 0.05 for India which means that Tr = 0.00005.
If tests are done completely randomly, then the number
of detected people (assuming that the tests are perfect)
would be Tr × I and so it is clear that we can identify
r(t) = Tr (t). It is then clear that this would have no
effect on the pandemic control. To have any effect we
would need r & γp ≈ 0.1 which means around 100 tests
per 1000 people per day which is clearly not practical.
However, a better strategy is to do focused tests on
the contacts of all those who have been detected on a
given day. We now give an estimate of the rate r if we
followed this strategy. For simplicity of presentation of
our argument we here assume νa = νp = 1 and γa = γp .

8
the value of T (t)/F (t) ≈ 25 (around May 15) for India
appears to be large, it may not be sufficient given that
the population densities are much larger than in many
other countries and implementation of SD may be less
effective. If we assume 20 contacts a day and the number
of days before isolation of the individual to be 5 we get
the rough estimate of A ≈ 100 and then the ratio T /F
thus has to be at least ≈ 100. This is the minimum
value of testing-to-detected ratio that has to be targeted
at localities with high infection rates. The details of the
arguments presented here are largely independent of the
specifics of the particular SEIR model that we study.

A.
FIG. 6. Data of number of tests per day per thousand in
several countries on a log-scale. Data from [20].

From our extended SEIR model the number of detected
cases per day is given by F (t) = rνa Ia + (rνp + γp )Ip =
rI + γp Ip . In the growing phase we have, from Eq. (19),
that Ia = αI and Ip = (1 − α)I. Hence we get F (t) = γ̂I
with γ̂ = r + (1 − α)γp . The total number of contacts
of the I = F (t)/γ̂ individuals would be AF (t)/γ̂, where
A is the mean number of contacts of a single infected
person. If we perform T tests per day on this pool, then
the rate of detections will be given by
r=

T γ̂
AF (t)

(45)

Denoting c = T /(AF ) and noting that γ̂ = r + (1 − α)γp ,
we self-consistently solve the above equation to find
r=

c(1 − α)γp
.
1−c

(46)

Now it is clear that unless r and γa = γp are of the same
order, TQ will not have much effect on the dynamics and
the change in R0 will be small. Setting r & γp then gives
us the condition
T &

AF (t)
.
2−α

(47)

Note that in our model we identify r(t) as our control rate
function that changes from the value 0 to a value rl ≈ γp
over the time scales of a week or so. This means that
we would need to change the testing rate in a controlled
way such that the condition T (t) ∼ AF (t) is maintained.
Thus the number of tests/per day has to be proportional
to number of new detections/per day and in fact the ratio
T /F has to be larger than the average number of contacts,
A, that each infectious person makes. The number A is
expected to depend on the population density and also
how well SD is being implemented. The table in Fig. 7
shows data for the ratio T (t)/F (t) for a set of countries
and also how this ratio has evolved over time. While

Comparision of intervention strategies

The model details are given in Sec. (I). We recall that
at any given time the total infectious population size is
I = Ia + Ip , the cumulative affected population (recovered, in hospital or dead) is R = Ua + Da + Up + Dp , the
reported total confirmed cases is C = Da + Dp + Up ,
and the reported new daily cases is F = dC/dt =
rνa Ia + (γp + rνp )Ip .
A useful quantity to characterize the system with
interventions is the targeted reproduction number [see
Eqs. (43,44)]
R0target =

αul βa
(1 − α)ul βp
+
.
γa + rl νa
γp + rl νp

(48)

We classify intervention strategies by the targeted R0target
value. A strong intervention is one where R0target < 1
and will achieve suppression of the disease while a weak
intervention is one with R0target & 1 and will only mitigate the effects of the disease.
Other than R0 , an important quantity to characterize
the disease growth is the largest eigenvalue µ of the linearized dynamics (see Sec. II A). In the early phase of
the pandemic, all populations other than S grow exponentially with time as ∼ eµt . As we will see, for the case
of strong intervention, µ becomes negative and gives the
exponential decay rate of the disease.
In our numerical study we choose, for the purpose of
illustration, the following parameter set: α = 0.67 and
the rates βa = 0.333, βp = 0.5, σ = 1/3, γa = 1/8, γp =
1/12 all in units of day−1 . For the specified choice of
parameter values (free case with u = 1.0, r = 0.0) we
get µ = 0.158 which is close to the value observed for
the early time data for confirmed cases in India. The
corresponding free value of R0 is 3.7665. Note that µ is
not uniquely fixed by R0 (and vice versa) and different
choices of parameters can give the same observed µ but
different values of R0
Choosing these typical parameter values for COVID19, we now compare the efficacy of strong and weak interventions implemented in four different ways: (1) 6WLDNTQ: Six weeks lockdown (strong value of SD parameter)
and no testing-quarantining, (2) ELD-NTQ: Extended

ESD-ETQ: Extended social distancing and extended
testing-quarantining. The case with no social distancing
and no testing-quarantining is indicated as NSD-NTQ.
We work with a population N = 107 and initial conditions E(0) = 100, Ia (0) = Ip (0) = Ua (0) = Da (0) =
Up (0) = Dp (0) = 0 and S(0) = N −E−Ia −Ip −Ua −Da −
Up − Dp . In all cases, we will assume that intervention
strategies are switched on when the confirmed number
of cases reaches 50 and after that the full intervention
values are attained over a time scale of 5 days.

1.

Strong intervention (R0target < 1)

In this case, the exponential growth stops around the
time when R0eff (t) crosses the value 1. After this time,
the infection numbers will start decaying exponentially.
Since the infection numbers are still small compared to
the total population, one can work with the linearized
theory and the magnitude of the largest eigenvalue µ
(now negative) determines the exponential decay rate.
For illustrating this case, we take:
Parameter set I [R0target = 0.667] — We choose three
SD and TQ strengths as (i) SD: ul = 0.177, rl = 0,
(ii) TQ: ul = 1, rl = 1.2 and (iii) SD-TQ:
ul = 0.461, rl = 0.4. This choice corresponds to
changing the free value of R0 = 3.766 to a target value
R0target = 0.667, for all the three different strategies.
The largest eigenvalue µ changes from the free value
µ = 0.158 to the values (i) µ = −0.027, (ii) µ = −0.077
(iii) µ = −0.0546 respectively. The results of the
numerical solution of the extended SEIR equations are
presented Figs. (8a) and (8b).
Main observations:

1. A six week (or eight week) lockdown is insufficient
to end the pandemic and will lead to a second
wave. If the interventions are carried on indefinitely, the pandemic is suppressed and only affects
a very small fraction of the population (less than
0.1%). We can understand all features of the dynamics from the linear theory. In Figs. 8(a,b), intervention is switched on after ≈ 2 weeks and the
peak in infections appears roughly after a period of
5 days. Thereafter however, the decay in the number of infections occurs slowly, the decay rate being
given by the largest eigenvalue µ (now negative and
smaller in magnitude than µ in the growth phase).
2. We find that for the same target R0target < 1, different intervention schemes (ELD-NTQ, NSD-ETQ,
or ESD-ETQ) can give very different values of the
decay rate µ and, in general we find that TQ is
more effective than SD. We see that ELD-NTQ
ends the pandemic in about 10 months while NSDETQ would take around 3.5 months. This can be
understood from the fact that the corresponding µ
values (post-intervention) are given by µ = −0.027
and µ = −0.077 respectively, i.e, they differ by a
factor of about 3. With a mixed strategy where
one allows almost three times more social contacts
(ul = 0.431) than for LD case and that requires
three times less testing (rl = 0.4) than for TQ
case, we see that the disease is controlled in about
5 months. Hence this appears to be the most practical and effective strategy.
3. The expected time for the pandemic to die would
be roughly given by
tend ∼

ln(Peak infection number)
,
|µpost−intervention |

(49)

and so it is important that intervention schemes are
implemented early and as strongly as possible.

the end of one year, for the different strategies. In the absence of interventions this is close to 96% and is given by Eq. (26). The
total population was taken as N = 107 . Parameter set II [R0target = 1.205]: (c) Total number of infected cases I = Ia + Ip for
different intervention strategies. (d) Total number of confirmed cases C = Up + Da + Dp . The dashed lines indicate the total
affected population R = C + Ua at the end of one year, for the different strategies. Total population was taken as N = 107 .

2.

Weak intervention (R0target & 1)

In this case, a finite fraction of the population is
eventually affected, but the intervention succeeds in
reducing this from its original free value and in delaying considerably the date at which the infections
peak. We take the following parameter set for this study:
Parameter set II [R0target = 1.205] — we choose three
SD and TQ strengths as (i) SD: ul = 0.32, rl = 0, (ii) TQ:
ul = 1, rl = 0.536 and (iii) SD-TQ: ul = 0.634, rl = 0.24.
This choice corresponds to changing the free value of
R0 = 3.766 to a fixed target value R0target = 1.205 for
all the three different strategies. The largest eigenvalue
µ remains positive and changes from the free value
µ = 0.158 to the values (i) µ = 0.0152, (ii) µ = 0.032 (iii)
µ = 0.0248 respectively. The results of the numerical
solution of the extended SEIR equations are presented
Figs. (8c) and (8d).

Main observations:
1. We find that in this case the peak infections, peak
infection time and the final affected population can
be obtained from the analytic expressions given by
Eqs. (26,39,40) in terms of the basic disease parameters, using their values after interventions are
introduced. We assume that the intervention parameters change from the values u = 0, r = 0 to
their full strength u = ul , r = rl over a short time
scale and thereafter remain constant.
2. We find that the peak infection numbers are smallest for the case with ELD-NTQ and they occur at
a later stage. These results can also be understood
mathematically from the expressions in Eq. (39)
and Eq. (40) using the post-intervention values of
γ and µ (from the linear theory).
3. We note that while weak interventions can slow
down and reduce the impact of the pandemic, they

11
do not lead to development of herd immunity of the
population (assuming that all the recovered people develop immunity). It is well known that herd
immunity is attained when a fraction 1 − 1/R0 of
the population has developed immunity. Thus herd
immunity in the above example would require that
1 − R0−1 ≈ 0.74, i.e 74% of the population be affected, while Eq. (26) with R0target = 1.205 predicts
that only about 31% of the population is affected.

B.

Observation of strong and weak intervention in
COVID-19 data

In Figs. (9) we give some examples of data for number
of new cases for nine countries where we see that some
of the qualitative features seen in the model results in
Fig. 8(a,b). In particular we see the fast exponential
growth phase and then a much slower decay phase for the
first six countries which have succeeded in controlling the
disease with various levels of success. On the other hand
we see that India, Brazil and Pakistan continue to show a
positive µ and it is clear that intervention schemes need
to be strengthened.

IV. DIFFICULTIES IN MAKING
PREDICTIONS FROM THE EXTENDED SEIR
MODEL: CASE STUDY FOR INDIA

In the following we make some heuristic predictions,
based on the analytic results in Eqs. (26,39,40) and the
present observed data, for daily new cases in India (N ≈
1.3 × 109 ), in the state of Delhi (N ≈ 1.9 × 107 ) and in
the city of Mumbai (N ≈ 1.3 × 107 ). The analysis here
is based on the assumption of a best case scenario where
the value of R0target , achieved after various intervention
schemes is maintained at a constant value.
Here we assume that intervention has effectively been
through SD, with r << γ being neglected. We consider
the following choice of parameter values which appears
to be reasonable for getting a conservative estimate: σ =
1/2, β̃p = β, β̃a = 2β/3, γ̃p = γp = γ, γ̃a = γa = 3γ/2,
i.e, we assume that asymptomatics are 2/3rd less infectious and recover 3/2 times faster. This gives us [using
Eq. (31)] γe = γ/(1 − α/3) and the effective reproductive number as R0target = (1 − 5α/9)β/γ. From this last
relation we can write β = γR0target /(1 − 5α/9). Plugging
this into the equation for the eigenvalues, Eq. (13), and
replacing λ by the observed mean exponential growth
rate (we choose the values of µ = 0.05 and µ = 0.035
which are representative of the values observed in India
since around April 10), we see that we basically get an
equation for R0target in terms of α, σ, γ and µ. For specific choices of α, σ and γ, the observed values of µ before
and after intervention will then give us the corresponding
values of R0 .

For our analysis we need to know the total infections I(0) on some day (we take this as April 11) and
we estimate it in the following way. Suppose that the
daily observed cases on this day was Fp (0) (assuming that only the symptomatics are detected). Then
we have Ip (0) = Fp (0)/γp . From Eq. (32) we have
(m)
Ip
= (1 − α)γe I (m) /γp and so the time to the peak
(m)
can be estimated as t(m) = µ−1 ln[Ip /Ip (0)]. We use
Eq. (39) to compute the peak number of infections I (m)
and the peak daily cases (PDC) is then obtained as
(m)
(m)
PDC= Fp
= γp Ip = (1 − α) × γe × I (m) . The total affected population fraction x̄, can be computed from
Eq. (26), using only the knowledge of R0target . If we assume the number of deaths is 1% of all symptomatic cases
this gives us an estimate for the total number of deaths
as N x̄(1 − α)/100.
The observed daily new cases in India, Delhi and Mumbai on April 10 were around Fp (0) ≈ 900, Fp (0) ≈ 115
and Fp (0) ≈ 195 respectively [30]. For a range of choice
of the parameters with σ = 0.5, 0.4, γ = 0.2, 0.143
and of α = 0.67, 0.9, and two representative values of
the post-intervention growth rates, µ = 0.05, 0.035, we
compute the corresponding values obtained for R0 and
(m)
R0target . These and the estimates for PDC= Fp , t(m)
and x̄ are given in Tables (I III) for µ = 0.05 and in
Tables (IV-VI) for µ = 0.035, for India, Delhi and Mumbai. Note that while the peak numbers and total affected
population and deaths simply scale with population size,
the time to peak depends on the daily detected numbers
on April 10, and this leads to the observed differences in
the time to the peak for the three cases. We also note
here that changing the initial conditions by about 10%
causes a change of few days in the peak time while the
other quantities remain unchanged. The full numerical
solution in Fig. (10) also shows that the complete suppression of the disease takes more than 6 months after
the peak.
In Fig. 10 we show results of a numerical solution of the
dynamical equations in presence of intervention (SD) for
one of the parameter sets in Table. III and find excellent
agreement with our analytic formula in Eqs. (26,39-31).
We see that the predicted peak time is off by about 10%.
The numerics also shows that the complete suppression
of the disease takes more than 6 months after the peak.
We point out that the mixed-population assumption
of the SEIR model is expected to be more accurate for
a smaller population and so the estimates for Delhi and
Mumbai would be more reliable than the one for India.
For a big and highly in-homogeneous country like India,
smaller regions (states or cities) would have different values of µ and R0 and also different initial conditions, hence
the global values would not capture the local dynamics
correctly. It is likely that the numbers in Table I are
an over-estimate of the true future trajectory. For the
state of Delhi and the city of Mumbai these would be
more accurate, however we see that the uncertainty in
the true value of α and other parameters leads to a huge

FIG. 9. Number of new cases per day for nine different countries. The dashed orange vertical lines in some of the figures
denote the day of the implementation of lockdown. We note that the first six data sets exhibits the same broad features that
we see for the model predictions in Fig. 8(a,b). In particular we see the fast exponential growth and slow exponential decrease
in new cases (following strong interventions). The two countries UK and US show a very slow decay rate, indicating that
disease suppression has barely been achieved. The data for India, Brazil and Pakistan show the behavior corresponding to
model predictions in Fig. 8(c,d) and have only been able to achieve mitigation so far (R0target > 1, µ > 0). Data from [29] and
the end date is June 10.

DISCUSSION

Several earlier work have discussed, using determinsitic
compartmentalized models, the effect of asymptomatic
affected population and the effect of intervention measures on the COVID pandemic [7–18]. Here we present a
somewhat different choice of compartments and perform
a careful quantitative comparison of different intervention strategies. A distinction from earlier studies is that
we present a number of analytic results which we believe will be useful beyond their immediate application
to epidemiological modeling, in more general studies of
population dynamics.
To summarize our findings, a modified version of the
SEIR model, incorporating asymptomatic individuals,

was analyzed in detail. We have obtained a number of
analytical results for the full nonlinear model which can
be useful in making empirical estimates of various important quantities that provide information on disease
progression. We believe that the derivation of these results can be extended to more sophisticated SIR type
models including more compartments and more complex
interactions. From the linearized dynamics we point out
a simple but important property, namely that at early
times the motion of the system quickly settles along the
direction of the dominant eigenvector. This allows one
to determine accurately initial conditions from sparse
data. We provided numerical examples to illustrate these
ideas and in addition have provided comparisons with
real COVID-19 data. Looking at COVID-19 data in several countries, we find that the extended SEIR model
captures some important qualitative features and hence
could provide guidance in policy-making
We used the extended SEIR model for analyzing the

effectiveness of different intervention protocols in controlling the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-clinical
interventions can be either through social distancing or
testing-quarantining. Our results indicate that a combination of both, implemented over an extended period
may be the most effective and practical strategy. We
have attempted to relate real testing rates to the parameters of the model and comment on what the minimum
testing rates should be in order for testing-quarantining
to be an effective control strategy.
Finally we have used our analytic formulas to make
predictions for disease peak numbers and expected time
to peak for India, the state of Delhi and the city of Mumbai, pointing out that these predictions would be highly
unreliable for India (due to big inhomogeneity in disease progression across the country) and perhaps more
reliable for the cases of Delhi and Mumbai. Our main

conclusion here is that the lack of precise knowledge of
the disease parameters (e.g the fraction of asymptomatic
carriers) and changing control strategies lead to rather
large uncertainties in the predictions. Nevertheless, we
believe that they could perhaps be used to obtain reasonable bounds.

FIG. 10. Plot of the new daily cases (γp Ip ) and total affected
population fraction (R), as a function number of months for
one of the parameter sets in Table. III for the city of Mumbai.
Parameter values were σ = 0.5, γ̃p = 0.2, α = 0.9, R0 = 2.16
before intervention and R0target = 1.3. The dashed lines give
the analytic predictions for the peak daily cases (black line)
and the final affected population ( green line), and show the
good agreement with the numerics. The arrows indicate the
date when initial condition was specified γp Ip (0) = 195 and
the peak infection date, which occurs about 15 days after the
date predicted from Eq. (40).
