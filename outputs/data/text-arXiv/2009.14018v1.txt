Executive Summary
Six months into the pandemic and one month after the phase
four reopening in New York City (NYC), restrictions are lifting,
businesses and schools are reopening, but global infections are
still rising. This white paper updates travel trends observed in
the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC and highlights
some findings toward the “new normal.”

Key Findings
•

•

•
•

•

•

According to MTA data (1), vehicular traffic volumes at
major NYC crossings have bounced back to only 10% less
than pre-pandemic levels by the week of August 17.
Previous editions of this white paper used a MATSim
simulation framework to estimate the return of traffic and
travel with NYC’s phased reopening. Estimated results
compared with observed VMT data show that simulation
predicted the VMT restoration in Phase 4 within 6% of
observed VMT.
The rebound in VMT is uneven across NYC, with some
boroughs seeing a slow comeback, and some boroughs
experiencing a higher VMT than the pre-pandemic period.
In Queens, VMTs were observed to be 18% lower in
August than February, while VMT in Manhattan,
Brooklyn, Bronx and Staten Island in August were 27%,
51%, 32%, and 23%, higher than February, respectively.
Estimated bus ridership and scheduled Access-A-Ride trips
were down 35% and 36%, while subway and commuter rail
ridership continued to lag, down 75% from 2019.
Travel times on the 495 Corridor (2) slightly increased by
an average of 6% eastbound and 4% westbound in the first
week of August, compared with the first week of July.
However, these travel times are still about 20% lower in
both directions compared to pre-pandemic levels.
In April 2020, the total number of monthly rides for yellow
taxis dropped 96%, 92% for green taxis, 79% for for-hire
vehicles (FHVs), and 76% for high volume for-hire
services (HVFHS) as compared to January 2020,
respectively. The number of rides started to increase
gradually in May and June but are still 91%, 86%, and 63%
lower for yellow, green, and HVFHS than in January 2020.
The average distance of a completed ride increased from

February to May, from 2.4 miles to 4.8 miles for yellow
taxis, and 2.7 miles to 3.8 miles for green taxis. This,
coupled with the drop in ridership, indicates that people are
taking longer, but less frequent, trips.
The average number of daily school zone speeding tickets
issued remains 70% higher in July and 62% higher in the
first two weeks of August 2020 compared with prepandemic levels in 2020. Speeding violations are also
likely to occur repetitively: 23% of ticketed vehicles
received more than one speeding ticket in June, and these
vehicles contributed to 44% of total speeding tickets.
Unsafe speed was listed as the primary cause for half of the
traffic fatalities in NYC in April (7 out of 14) and 42% of
the fatalities in May (5 out of 12) according to NYPD’s
Motor Vehicle Collision reports (12).
Weigh-in-motion (WIM) data from C2SMART’s testbed
on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) (3) showed
that average daily traffic (ADT) has fully recovery for both
Queensbound (QB) and Staten Island-bound (SIB) traffic
by the first two weeks of August, compared with February
2020. Average daily truck traffic (ADTT) for QB is 5%
higher and is down by 8% SIB in August vs. February.
The demand for cycling continued to increase in July. The
daily number of Citi Bike trips (5) was 9% higher
compared to June, and up 71% from February.
Detection results based on a deep-learning based videoprocessing algorithm (4) show that average pedestrian
density from 11 select locations in NYC continued to see a
gradual increase (+10%) in July compared to June. The
average percentage of pedestrians observed to be able to
follow social distancing guidelines of remaining a
minimum of 6 feet from others remained at a constant level
(~82%) in June and July, as seen from traffic cameras.
24-hour density distribution estimations show that car and
pedestrian densities over the course of the day resemble
pre-pandemic patterns. The cyclist density in observed
locations has exceeded pre-pandemic levels, for example
up 34% in the afternoon (2-6:00 PM) at 5th Ave/42 St.
Continued tracking of subway ridership from multiple
cities in China show that only 85% of pre-pandemic
ridership levels have been restored 6-months after full
reopening of those cities. Where a second wave occurred,
the restoration only reached 65% of pre-pandemic volume.

Vehicular Traffic and Transit Trends
The average daily vehicular traffic via MTA bridges and
tunnels (B&T) continued to rebound through mid-August,
bouncing back from pandemic lows to 90% of pre-pandemic
levels, according to MTA data (1). Table 1 presents the weekly
percentage change in vehicular traffic via MTA bridges and
tunnels, compared to the same week in 2019. While most of the
bridges and tunnels in Queens and Manhattan had a relatively
slower recovery (e.g., -33% Queens Midtown Tunnel, -27%
Henry Hudson Bridge, -20% Robert F. Kennedy Bridge in the
week of August 9 compared to the same week in 2019), bridges
and tunnels connecting Brooklyn were down only about 10%.
Traffic volume remained mostly stable for most bridges and
tunnels over the past four weeks (July 19 to August 15).

As of August 16, Weigh-in-motion (WIM) data from
C2SMART’s testbed on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway
(BQE) (3) showed that average daily traffic (ADT) is down by
only 2% for Queensbound (QB), and 4% for Staten Islandbound (SIB) traffic in the first two weeks of August, as
compared with February 2020. Average daily truck traffic
(ADTT) for SIB is down by 8% and is 5% higher QB in August
compared to February. The average vehicle speed on BQE
remained around the same level in the first weeks of August
compared to June but is still 8% higher for SIB and 2% higher
for QB, as compared to February.

C2SMART researchers continued to investigate crowd density
trends and social distancing patterns during the subsequent
COVID-19 recovery process using a deep learning-based
computer vision method introduced in the previous issues of
this white paper. Object detection is being applied to real-time
traffic camera videos at multiple key locations within NYC (4).
In July, average pedestrian density continued to see a gradual
increase (+10%) from 11 locations in NYC on selective days as
compared with June (a 62% increase from April lows). The
average percentage of pedestrians following social distancing
guidelines of remaining a minimum of 6 feet from others
remained the same (~82%) in June and July.

Bus ridership and scheduled Access-A-Ride trip volumes (1)
were 35% and 36% of 2019 averages by the week of August 17,
2020, which were 20 and 17 percentage points increase from
June, respectively. However, average subway and commuter
rail ridership in NYC continues to stay low – a 74%, 73% and
77% decline in weekly ridership for NYC subway, Long Island
Rail Road (LIRR), and Metro North Railroad (MNR) in the
week of August 17, compared to weekly averages in 2019.
Figure 1 shows the weekly ridership trends reported by MTA
compared to 2019.

Figure 2 illustrates the 24-hour temporal density of daily
snapshots of the distributions of pedestrian, cars, and cyclists at
a selected location (5 Ave/42 St, Manhattan). A gradual
increase was observed in all three modes. The temporal
distribution in car and pedestrian densities around the end of
July were observed to be similar to pre-pandemic patterns over
the course of the day, whereas the cyclist density exceeded prepandemic levels with a 34% uptick in the afternoon period (2:00
PM– 6:00 PM) at this location.

Travel times on the 495 Corridor (2) increased by an average of
6% eastbound and 4% westbound in the first week of August,
compared with the first week of July 2020. However, these
travel times are still about 20% lower in both directions
compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Uneven Increase in Vehicle Miles Travelled
According to Streetlight (7), total Vehicle Miles Travelled
(VMT) in the NYC region has been steadily increasing since
the initial phases of reopening. Nevertheless, the VMT increase
is uneven across NYC, with some boroughs seeing a slow
comeback, and some boroughs experiencing even a higher
VMT than the pre-pandemic period (Figure 4). In Queens,
VMTs were observed to be 18% lower in August than February
2020. However, VMT in other boroughs in August surpassed
pre-pandemic levels.

Interborough Traffic
StreetLight InSight (7) data was used to estimate the change in
interborough traffic in April 2020 and July 2020 compared with
April 2019 levels in Table 2 and Table 3. By July, interborough
traffic has seen a nearly full recovery from April lows, except
trips originating and ending in Manhattan, which saw a much
slower rebound. Moreover, traffic between Brooklyn and the
Bronx has increased (41% and 43%) from pre-pandemic levels.

Figure 2 Temporal distributions of pedestrian, car, and cyclist
densities (5 Ave/42 St, Manhattan)
Cycling continued to increase in July. According to Citi Bike
system data (5), on average, there were 67,422 rides in NYC
per day in July, a 9% increase compared to June and a 71%
increase compared to February 2020. Figure 3 illustrates the
Citi Bike daily ridership trends since March.

inbound and outbound traffic in Staten Island in June, possibly
due to the increased delivery demand from the Amazon

Taxis and For Hire Vehicles
The recent data released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine
Commission (TLC) (9) show the sharp decrease in yellow taxi,
green taxi, FHV, and high volume for-hire services (HVFHS)
usage from the second week of March 2020 onwards. FHVs
include Community Cars (aka Liveries), Black Cars, and
Luxury Limousines, whereas HVFHS include records from
Uber, Lyft, and Via. At the beginning of April, trips in all TLC
licensed vehicles dropped 84% compared to the same time last
year. According to a report by TLC (8), in April 2020, 28,893
TLC drivers were on the road, compared with 122,076 TLC
drivers in April 2019 (a 76% drop). From March through April
2020, trips to parts of the city with hospitals increased as a
percentage of all pick-ups, while trips to and from airports
decreased (8).

According to TLC data (9), the total number of monthly rides
for yellow taxis dropped by 96%, 92% for green taxis, 79% for
FHVs, and 76% for HVFHS in April compared to January 2020
(Table 4). The number of rides gradually rebounded in May and
June but are still 60-90% lower than those in January 2020. In
February, HVFHSs completed, on average, nearly 750,000 trips
per day, Yellow Taxis completed 217,000 trips per day, and
Green Taxis completed 14,000 trips per day. Trips began to
decline for all three types in the middle of March and reached
their lowest point in April (144,000, 8,000, and 1,000 trips per
day, respectively) (Figure 5).

Spatial Distributions
Figure 6 shows the spatial distribution in yellow taxi, green taxi,
and HVFHS rides from March to June 2020. Green taxi rides
ending in the upper Manhattan zones of Central Harlem North,
Hamilton Heights, and Washington Heights North increased in
June 2020. HVFHS had seen the most recovery in ridership
levels since the start of the pandemic at JFK airport, Forest
Hills, and Middle Village, Queens. For the Bronx and Staten
Island, total rides have remained steady in the last four months.

(c) HVFHS (left-March, middle-April, right-June 2020)

The average number of passengers decreased, especially for
green taxis, since the start of the pandemic - this might be
because the passengers are advised against sitting beside the
driver in any taxis or FHVs, to adhere to social distancing
norms. The average passenger count for a ride for the months
of January to June 2020 are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 6 Spatial distributions by sector

Trip Distance, Duration and Passenger Count
The average distance of a completed rides has increased during
the pandemic (Figure 7). This, coupled with the drop in
ridership, points to a trend where people are taking longer trips,
but perhaps only when most necessary. As ridership numbers
increase, the average trip distance also become shorter.

After examining unique plate IDs, speeding tickets per vehicle
is summarized in Table 5. 14%, 29%, and 23% of the vehicles
received more than one speeding ticket in February, April, and
June 2020, respectively, and these vehicles contributed to 27%,
54%, 44% of the total speeding tickets in February, April, and
June 2020, respectively.

A Surge in Speeding

School Zone Speeding Tickets

While the pandemic has resulted in reductions in traffic
congestion, speeding, observed by the number of speeding
tickets issued, has increased. Data from speed camera violations
(10) highlights that speeding violations skyrocketed during the
pandemic. The New York Independent Budget Office reported
that although parking violations were issued despite restrictions
being lifted during the March 23 to May 31 period in Question,
77% of all summonses issued were for speed (11). Average
daily school zone speeding tickets were up 70% and 62% in
July and the first two weeks of August 2020 compared to
January 1 to March 12 of 2020. Figure 10 presents the time
series of weekly numbers of speeding tickets since January
2020.

Speeding vs. Crashes
NYPD motor vehicle collision data (12) reports traffic crashes
in NYC and the contributing factor(s) associated with each
crash. Reported contributing factors include behaviors such as
passing or lane usage, improper or unsafe lane changing, and
unsafe speed. Figure 11 shows the total crashes and the number
of crashes primarily due to unsafe speed reported by NYPD. It
is worth mentioning that not all crashes were associated with a
specific contributing factor, therefore the actual number of
crashes due to unsafe speed could be higher than what was
reported.

Despite a decrease in traffic-related fatalities due to lower
traffic volumes and less exposure of pedestrians, the fatality
rate in crashes (fatalities/number of total crashes) changed from
1.5 fatalities/1000 crashes in February 2020 to 3.4, 2.0, 4.2 and
2.5 fatalities/1000 crashes in April, May, June, and July 2020,
respectively. Although a relative higher fatality rate was
observed in April and June, more data is needed to identify a
trend (Figure 13).

Figure 14 shows the comparison of the predicted restored trips
when NYC enters Phase 4 reopening with the most recently
observed data. The daily transit ridership is based on MTA
ridership (1) from July 20 to August 31, daily car and walk trip
ratios are from the Apple mobility reports (13) from July 20 to
August 30. CitiBike data is available from July 20 to August 2
from CitiBike system data (5). It should be noted that some
industries which were planned to have fully reopened in phase
4 did not do so (e.g., university, indoor dining, etc.), therefore,
predicted transit and car trips are slightly higher than the
observed data. The difference in CitiBike trips is relatively
large, but this might be due to several reasons, including the
major CitiBike expansion this year as well as free membership
for essential workers, which were not initially considered in the
model assumptions.

The June issue of this white paper introduced an agent-based
simulation model (MATSim-NYC) that was used to predict
how this pandemic could change travel behavior and provided
some insights for the reopening of NYC. The VMT from
MATSim simulation results is compared with the observed
VMT data from StreetLight (7). The observed average daily
VMT in July and August has been restored to 131% of the prepandemic period VMT (January 2020), while the predicted
VMT restoration from the simulation model is 137% (a 6%
difference). This shows that on an aggregate level the model
was able to accurately predict the increased preference for
driving by NYC’s Phase 4 reopening.

Ongoing MATSim-NYC work will analyze the transportation
system with different travel behavior and transit operation
assumptions by examining the following performance
measurements: traffic congestion, emissions, and social
contacts in transit. 12 scenarios were designed for NYC traffic
conditions in the post-pandemic period with considerations of
four impact factors due to COVID-19: the change of mode
preference, with/without transit capacity restriction, the rise of
the remote workforce, and the flexible work hours suggested by
the health authorities. Estimations will be reported in the future.

pedestrians, reducing traffic violence and inequality, balancing
vehicular traffic and encouraging sustainable transportation
alternatives for all ages and abilities, and maintaining the
affordability and functionality of transit systems. Deeper
consideration for vulnerability assessments and incremental
improvements to make transportation systems more resilient
and well-prepared are still needed.

Future Updates to COVID-19 Transportation Trends
C2SMART’s
COVID-19
Dashboard
(available
at
http://c2smart.engineering.nyu.edu/covid-19-dashboard), an
all-in-one mobility and sociability trend monitor, will continue
to consolidate public data sources to track the impact of the
pandemic on transportation systems. Most of the data and
aggregated statistics will be updated weekly and are open for
download. The current dashboard contains data from traditional
traffic detectors, crowdsourcing applications, probe vehicles,
real-time traffic cameras, and police and hotline reports from
multiple affected cities. This platform will continue to evolve
with the addition of new data, metrics, and visualizations.
Through this interactive data dashboard, researchers,
transportation authorities, and the general public have direct
access to information that can be used to monitor the
pandemic’s ongoing impacts to our cities and transportation
systems to make more effective data-driven decisions.

To gain insights on what subway recovery might look like in
the aftermath of COVID-19 and what may happen if a second
wave occurs, subway ridership in multiple cities in China is
shown in Figure 15. In Shanghai and Guangzhou, 85% of prepandemic ridership was restored 6 months after reopening.
Wuhan, the Chinese epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, had
a phased reopening one month after the other cities in China. It
has seen a 61% recovery in subway ridership 5 months after
reopening. Beijing implemented a stricter reopening strategy at
first (e.g., mandate to maintain subway car occupancy below
50% of its maximum capacity) and also experienced a second
wave of COVID-19 in late June. Beijing ridership has
recovered to only 65% of pre-pandemic levels, 6 months after
its initial reopening.

Summary of Findings
One month after the phase 4 reopening in NYC, traffic
conditions are still evolving. The rebound in traffic is uneven
across NYC and the recovery speed of different transportation
subsystems is not uniform. New challenges such as the
increasing VMT in certain regions, high demand for bikes,
growing funding gaps for public transportation, and the surge
in speeding behavior are raised. Adapting to the “new normal”
and taking actions to address these enormous challenges in the
aftermath of COVID-19 is crucial: providing a safe and
accessible micromobility network and open space for
