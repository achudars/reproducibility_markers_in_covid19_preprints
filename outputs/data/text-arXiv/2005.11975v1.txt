Abstract
The availability of intensive care beds during the Covid-19 epidemic is crucial
to guarantee the best possible treatment to severely affected patients. In this work
we show a simple strategy for short-term prediction of Covid-19 ICU beds, that has
proved very effective during the Italian outbreak in February to May 2020. Our

1

approach is based on an optimal ensemble of two simple methods: a generalized
linear mixed regression model which pools information over different areas, and an
area-specific non-stationary integer autoregressive methodology. Optimal weights
are estimated using a leave-last-out rationale. The approach has been set up and
validated during the epidemic in Italy. A report of its performance for predicting
ICU occupancy at Regional level is included.

Introduction

Italy has been, and partially still is, under pressure to properly manage the recent COVID19 epidemic emerged from China in December 2019. Its quick spread required a global
response to prepare health systems worldwide. In its present form, COVID-19 seems to
have two very challenging characteristics (see also [1]): it is highly infectious and, despite
having a benign course in the vast majority of patients, it requires hospital admission and
even intensive care for a far from negligible proportion of infected.
In Italy, particularly in the two Regions of Lombardia and Veneto, the COVID-19
infection emerged in February 2020 with a basic reproductive number R0 between 3 and 4
[2]. At the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, Italy was one of the countries with the
lowest amount of acute care beds per person in Europe. The resources of the national health
system were not designed to face a large-scale epidemic. The national health system was
equipped with a total number of approximately 5200 beds, that was substantially increased
very quickly during the spread of the disease [3]. This reversed a trend that started years
ago, especially after financial crises, according to which resources allocated to the national
health system were progressively cut.
In general, ICUs are characterized by a rather low number of beds with high turnover.
Most of patients stay in intensive care only for one or few days [4], even if some of them can
stay months. However, ICU length of stay (LOS) due to COVID-19 infection was rather
long: a recent study [5] involving 1591 patients admitted in ICUs in Lombardia reported
a median length of stay of 9 days (6-13 [95% CI]). Long LOS implied a slower turnover,
and increased the risk of collapse of the national ICU system. Indeed, in the absence of
measures to flatten the epidemic curve, the number of ICU beds available in Italy would
have achieved very quickly 100% occupation, leaving several thousand patients short of the
cures needed (see also [3] for a discussion).
It is now clear that measures like social distancing, use of masks, contact tracing,
and a wide access to diagnostic testing coupled with isolation of positives can be very
effective. Nevertheless, careful and reliable planning of resources can also aid substantially
in controlling the consequences of the epidemics, and likely increase the likelihood of early
diagnoses and better care. To respond to the looming threat of shortage of ICU beds,
hospitals urgently need to establish and implement policies that more fairly allocate these
scarce resources. If hospitals can plan in advance how many ICU beds shall be made
available for the nearly following days, capacity can be increased (or decreased) to match the
demand. This would avoid the ethical dilemma of severe triaging patients and not admitting
2

those whose lives are not worth saving [6]. In this work we propose one statistical tool of
this sort, which can be used to accurately forecast the ICU occupation for the next one to
five days. Beds demand in intensive care depends on two factors: the number of COVID-19
patients needing intensive care, and duration of their hospitalisation. Unfortunately, these
data are not made available during the Italian outbreak. Public data include, anyway, daily
ICU occupation by Region, which we use as a proof of concept.
Existing approaches to forecast ICU occupancy are mainly based on exponential models
fitted to daily numbers of occupied critical care beds out of confirmed cases [7, 8] or
on SIR (susceptible, infectious, recovered) models [9]. Both approaches are subject to
certain limitations in our opinion. An obvious limitation of the former approach includes
ascertainment bias due to the use of counts of confirmed cases, and inappropriate modeling
assumptions (including for instance a Gaussian assumption for log-counts). A model of
the SIR family may on the other hand be a very appropriate option. However, SIR-based
models require the possibility to precisely estimate several characteristics of the epidemics
which are still mostly unknown, and it is well known that changing even slightly the initial
conditions can lead to very different results. This is even more difficult as the exposed
population is only partially observed [10, 11, 12].
Our approach is based on optimally combining two forecasting methods. The first is
based on Poisson mixed effects regression; the second one is a Region-specific time series
model for counts, taking into account time-dependence over time. The count outcome is
appropriately modeled as a Poisson conditionally on observed time trends and unobserved
heterogeneity including dependence, as implied by random effects or by the auto-regressive
structure of the time-series models, and the averaged predictions give an optimal balance
between pooling information over different areas (which targets a low variance prediction)
and adaptation at the specific area (which targets a low bias prediction).
The rest of the paper is as follows: in the next section we give a description of the
available data. In Section 3 we describe our method for prediction of the next-day ICU
occupancy. We mention here that we have validated our method during the outbreak, by
repeatedly producing ICU predictions with the current data, and waiting for the official
data for the next five days. An illustration of the performance of our approach is given in
Section 4. Some concluding remarks are in Section 5.
An implementation of our approach for the Italian case is available within our Shiny
app at: https://statgroup19.shinyapps.io/StatGroup19-Eng.

Data

On January 31, 2020, the Italian Government declared the state of emergency for six months
as a consequence of the health risk associated with COVID-19 infection.
To inform citizens and make the collected data available, the Department of Civil Protection
developed an interactive geographic dashboard (accessible at the addresses http://arcg.is/C1unv
(desktop) and http : //arcg.is/081a51 (mobile)) and built a daily updated data githubrepository (CC-BY-4.0 license), with a large number of variables; among them the intensive
care defined as number of hospitalized patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) available at

the Regional level (20 Italian Regions). In Figure 1 the time series of ICU admission from
February 24 until April 16 , 2020 are reported and it appears that several sources of heterogeneity affect the data. The epidemic started at different times across Regions, starting
from the North of the country and evolved very differently in each Region, leading to trajectories of different shapes. Population size is also very different across Italian Regions
(Figure 2), which are also characterized by different economic and social structures. Moreover, a further heterogeneity source relates to the ICU capacity. In Italy, the health system
is Regional-based, so in practice there are 20 different health systems and management
choices, local authorities and local policy makers play a fundamental role in the definition
of health services capacities, with very few national directives.
During the epidemic some of the northern Regions went beyond the capacity of the
local system. Figure 3 reports the Regional rate of occupancy (occupancy over capacity1 )
during the epidemic. Regions are ordered geographically from North to South showing the
north-south gradient of the epidemic evolution mostly affecting the northern Regions. It is
rather clear that the health systems of northern Regions were under pressure for a longer
period and this reflects the difference in the spread of the epidemic. A Regional model that
takes into account different sources of heterogeneity and the different timing in the spread
of the epidemic is thus required.

Methods

In order to produce accurate forecasts we combined two methods, one based on joint
modelling all Regions through a mixed-effects generalized linear regression model, and
the other one based on separately modelling each Region as a non-stationary time-series
of counts, which uses an integer-valued autoregression specification, with covariates. The
first approach pools information over Regions, reducing variance of the final prediction;
the second instead can be expected to have a lower bias. The final predictions are then
averaged with weights chosen through a leave-last-out method. Furthermore, in order to
focus more on the recent trends, we always set T = 15, that is, we use the last two weeks
of data to make predictions and ignore previous measurements.

3.1

Random effects modelling of longitudinal count data

We start assuming that the observed daily ICU admissions for Region i at day t, yit ,
are realizations of independent Poisson random variables Yit with parameter µit , ∀i =
1, . . . , I, t = 1, . . . , T . The interest is in modelling µit as a non-linear function of time,
taking into account unobserved heterogeneity and Region-specific effects. A simple way to
deal with these features is through a Generalised Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) [13] with
linear predictor
log(µit ) = (β0 + b0i ) + (β1 + b1i ) × t + (β2 + b2i ) × t2 + log(residentsi )

(1)

where a canonical link has been adopted, the offset term log(residentsi ) accounts for
different population exposures, β = (β0 , β1 , β2 ) represents the vector of shared fixed-effects
regression parameters, and bi = (b0i , b1i , b2i ) represents the random coefficients, i.e. the
Region-specific intercept and slopes, with
bi = N (0, ΣB )
The observed counts are assumed independent given the three-dimensional random
vector bi . The likelihood function is obtained integrating out the bi in (2)

)
(2)

As widely discussed in the literature, the integral in (2) has no analytical solution, and
approximate methods should be used in order to estimate the parameters β and ΣB . Here,
a Laplace approximation has been used first of all to speed up computations. Adaptive
Gaussian quadrature may represent a slightly more accurate option, at the expense of a
higher computational burden. Other approaches can also be considered [14, 15].
Predictions are based on the posterior estimates of the random effects and the MLE of
the fixed-effect parameters. Predictions intervals are found through non-parametric block
bootstrap using 500 replicates. Block bootstrap involves resampling Regions, and once a
6

Region is included its entire time-series is used for model estimation of the resampled data.
This is done to preserve the dependency structure of the data.
It is worth mentioning that the specific covariance structure among the random effects
has been chosen on the grounds of model selection using BIC. In our data, the best covariance structure, which has been then used for all estimates and predictions, has turned out
to be:

3.2

Region-specific integer-valued autoregression modelling

At the second step, we fit and obtain predictions for Regional time series separately. In
other words, 20 different models are fitted, as time-series models for counts.
Let again Yit be the daily number of ICU admissions and let xit = (t0 , t1 , . . . , tr )T denote
an (r+1)-dimensional time-varying covariate vector, consisting of a polynomial specification
of time; notice that this vector is Region-specific, so different polinomial specifications can
be selected for different Regions. We model Yit as a conditional Poisson distribution where
the expectation µit at time t depends on both past counts and past covariates:
µit = α0 µi,t−1 + α1 Yi,t−1 + γ T xi,t−1 ,

t > 1.

(4)

where the coefficients α0 and α1 represent the effecst of the expectation µi,t−1 in the previous
day and the number of ICU admissions in the previous day Yi,t−1 , respectively.
Note that the model defined by (4) belongs to the INGARCHX family [16, 17, 18]. An
alternative approach would be to examine the log-linear INGARCH model of [19]. However,
the linear model has significant advantages in terms of interpretation, since it allows for
an additive decomposition of the expectation. Under the Poisson assumption, equations
(4) corresponds to a GARCH-type model [20] for the conditional variance of the process;
hence the name INGARCH has been used frequently in the literature (though there is some
debate on this terminology, see e.g.[21]).
For each Region, we compare stationary, linear, quadratic and cubic trends (that is,
r = 0, 1, 2, 3). We select the best model specification for each one separately, according to
the Bayesian information criterion.
Parameters in equation (4) are estimated via conditional maximum quasi-likelihood
estimation, using the function tsglm in the tscount R package. If the Poisson assumption
holds true, then we obtain an ordinary ML estimator. Predictions and their confidence
intervals are obtained as follows. The distribution of the 1-step-ahead prediction is not
known analytically and it is thus approximated numerically by a parametric bootstrap
procedure. One-step-ahead prediction intervals can be straightforwardly obtained and are
based on simulations of realizations from the fitted model; the approximated prediction
intervals are obtained from the empirical 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the boostrap-based
predictions.

Model averaging
(1)

Let ŷi,T +1 denote the prediction obtained for the i-th Region (i = 1, . . . , 20 for the Italian
(2)
case) and time T + 1 with the GLMM method, and ŷi,T +1 the prediction obtained with the
integer autoregressive method. The final prediction is
(1)

(2)

ŷi,T +1 = wi,T +1 ŷi,T +1 + (1 − wi,T +1 )ŷi,T +1 ,

(5)

for some wi,T +1 ∈ (0, 1). In order to estimate an optimal wi,T +1 , we first repeat model
(1)
(2)
estimation excluding yiT for i = 1, . . . , I; obtaining leave-last-out predictions ŷiT and ŷiT ;
and then we solve the optimization problem
wi,T +1 = arg inf

x∈(0,1)

(1)

(2)

xŷiT + (1 − x)ŷiT .

It shall be here noted that for the first few days, when T < 15, we make the weighthomogeneity assumption wi,T +1 = wj,T +1 for all i 6= j. For reasons of simplicity final
prediction intervals are obtained as the weighted average of the limits of prediction intervals
(1)
(2)
for ŷi,T +1 and ŷi,T +1 . It is straightforward to use Jensen’s inequality to show that this
conservatively guarantees the nominal level.

Results

The reliability and goodness of our approach can be assessed by checking the next-day
performance as: (i) median absolute error over the twenty Italian Regions, (ii) mean relative
error over the twenty Italian Regions, (iii) proportion of prediction intervals that do not
contain the actually observed occupancy, (iv) proportion of observed occupacies above the
upper limit of the prediction interval. For illustrative purposes we discuss in this section
predictions related to the next day, for days from March, 17 to April, 27th.
The daily absolute error has a median of 4 beds, with first quartile 1 and third quartile
8. The daily relative error over the twenty Regions has first quartile 2%, median 5%,
third quartile 12%. Its mean is 9.2%. For prediction intervals we used a nominal level
of 99%. Out of the 840 intervals produced, 99.4% indeed contained the observed ICU
occupation. Figure 4 summarizes the main results. We report a plot of the next-day
performance for each day since March, 17. It can be seen that after the first two weeks,
when data available were scarce and a unique weight was used, the absolute and relative
errors decreased substantially. Furthermore, coverage of the prediction intervals was always
very close to 100%, with only one occasion in which one Region reported an ICU occupation
above the predicted upper limit. Overall, the approach is rather effective and needs just
few data points to produce reasonable estimates.
Just to corroborate the results, we provide an example of the forecasts shown daily at
https://statgroup19.shinyapps.io/StatGroup19-Eng. On April 9th , we published the
forecasts displayed in Table 1 on the web, along with 99% confidence intervals. On April
10th , we checked how well the ensemble approach performs. Overall, the performance of
the proposal is more than satisfactory. The observed values are all into the 99% confidence

intervals, whose length is reasonable and ensure a good representation of the uncertainty
surrounding the forecasts. The upper bound of the confidence interval can be used as the
worst possible scenario for a specific day and resources should be allocated accordingly to
guarantee optimal health services. To be fair, the confidence interval for Puglia is rather
wide. However, this is not surprising, as patients were transferred from northern Regions to
Puglia for a few days, and daily bursts in the time series of ICU admissions were observed.
In the following plot (Figure 5), we provide a focus on some Regions, those whose health
systems were under pressure for the longest time. The prediction intervals were slightly
wide but reasonable, for instance for Lombardia, the most severely affected Region, the
median length was 20% of the predicted occupancy. Median difference between upper limit
of the prediction interval and total available beds in the Region is 4.6% in Veneto. We also
report data and estimates for Piemonte. This is because the news overlooked the situation
in Piemonte, mainly focusing on Lombardia and Veneto. However, while Veneto was more
effective at containing the epidemic, the health system in Piemonte was (and partially still
is) under pressure, with a decay in the ICU occupancy much slower than the other Regions.

Conclusions

We estimated the occupancy of ICU beds at the Regional level in Italy during the Covid19 outbreak. The resulting estimates are obtained as a combination of two approaches,
which address different data features, i.e. heterogeneity and time-dependence, merged via

ensambling. The proposed approach is data-driven, no simulated scenarios are required,
and it is based on rather simple modelling assumptions. We have discussed in this paper
only one-day ahead predictions, but our approach can also be easily extended to three-days
and five-days horizons.
From the beginning of this emergency in Italy, the ICU bed capacity was identified as
a major bottleneck, to be monitored to avoid the increase in the fatality rate. Accordingly,
strong efforts have been dedicated to this issue from government and planners. Our approach was able to predict the demand of ICU beds since the very beginning, showing an
improvement in its behavior as long as more data were available. These information and
predictions were shown and freely available on a daily basis on the StatGroup-19 Facebook
page (https://www.facebook.com/StatGroup-19-100907671547894). A correct communication of the evolution of the epidemic under all its variables was crucial to properly inform
the general public and avoid any unmotivated concern.
As a by-product conclusion drawn from this analysis, we noticed that the Regional
health systems, though under pressure, were able to properly satisfy the demand for critical
care. This might be related to the restrictions imposed by the government, which effectively
reduced the spread of the Covid-19 in Regions with a low number of ICU beds.
