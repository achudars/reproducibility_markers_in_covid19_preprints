General Idea: Naturally produced droplets from humans (such as those produced by breathing, talking,
sneezing, and coughing) include several types of cells (e.g., epithelial cells and cells of the immune
system), physiological electrolytes contained in mucous and saliva (e.g. Na+ , K+ , Cl− ), as well as,
potentially, several infectious agents (e.g. bacteria, fungi, and viruses). In response to the novel
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, which has become a major public health issue worldwide, we
provide a concise overview of airborne germ transmission as seen from a physics perspective. We also
study whether coronavirus aerosols can travel far from the immediate neighborhood and get airborne
with the convective currents developed within confined spaces.
Methodology: Methods of fluid dynamics are utilized to analyze the behavior of various-size airborne
droplets containing the virus.
Study Findings: We show that existing vortices in the air can make a location far away from the source
of the virus be more dangerous than a nearby (e.g., 6 feet away) location.
Practical Implications: Our study reveals that it seems reasonable to adopt additional infection-control
measures to the recommended 6 feet social distancing. We provide a recommendation that could help
to slow down the spread of the virus.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The recent outbreak of the respiratory disease identified as COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, shortened to SARS-CoV2 [1–3]. The outbreak, first reported in December 2019,
has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. Indeed,
COVID-19 is spreading across the globe with a speed and
strength that laid bare the limits of our understanding
of the transmission pathways and the associated factors
that are key to the spread of such diseases. In particular,
the virus can spread from seemingly healthy carriers or
people who had not yet developed symptoms [4]. Overall, this has transformed the face of healthcare around
the world.
To understand and prevent the spread of a virus like
SARS-CoV-2, it is important to estimate the probability of airborne transmission as aerosolization with particles potentially containing the virus. There have been
reports favoring the possibility of creating coronavirus
aerosols [5]. Thus far no aerosolized coronavirus particles have been found in hospital searches within the most
public areas, but evidence has been detected in rooms of
SARS-CoV-2 patients [6–9]. In this paper we provide an
overview on the possible threat of SARS-CoV-2 airborne
infection from a physics point of view, focusing attention
on the effect of convection currents in indoor spaces.
The layout of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we
first provide a concise discussion of the motion of the
virus in suspended aerosols. After that, using the SimScale program [10] we study the convective airflow in
a meeting room and office space. We show that existing vortices in the air can make a location far away
from the source of the virus be more dangerous than a
nearby (e.g., 6 feet away) location. In Sec. III we present
our conclusions. Throughout we adopt the convention

of the World Health Organization to nickname particles
that are & 5 µm diameter as droplets and those . 5 µm
as aerosols or droplet nuclei [11].

II. MODELING THE EFFECT OF CONVECTION
CURRENTS IN THE TRANSMISSION OF SARS-COV-2

In the presence of air resistance, compact heavy objects
fall to the ground quickly, while light objects exhibit
Brownian motion and follow the pattern of turbulent
convection of the air. For aerosol particles containing
the virus, the boundary between these two behaviors
depends on the size of the particle. We begin with a
simple question: how long does a virus float in the air
under the influence of gravity? To answer this query we
model the virus as a sphere of radius r ∼ 90 nm and mass
m ∼ 2.5×10−19 kg [12], and we assume that this spherical
particle is suspended in a viscous fluid (the air) feeling
the Earth’s gravitational field. Herein, gravity tends to
make the particles settle, while diffusion and convection
act to homogenize them, driving them into regions of
smaller concentration. On the one hand, the convection
mechanism provides particle macro-mixing within the
fluid through the tendency of hotter and consequently
less dense material to rise, and colder, denser material
to sink under the influence of gravity. On the other
hand, the diffusion mechanism acts on the scale of an
individual particle (micro-mixing) slowly and randomly
moving through the media.
Under the action of gravity, the virus acquires a downward terminal speed that follows from Stokes law and is
given by
vdown = µmg ,

is the virus mobility in the fluid, and where η = 1.8 ×
10−5 kg/(ms) is the dynamic viscosity of air [13]. Substituting (2) into (1) we find that the downward terminal speed of the virus in dry air is indeed negligible,
vdown ∼ 8 × 10−8 m/s. It is therefore clear that gravity
plays no role in the motion of an isolated virus through
the air. Rather it follows a convection pattern in a manner similar to how smelly substances move through the
air. The survival probability of the virus in the dry air is
then given by the likelihood of survival outside its natural environment. The half-life of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols
has been found to be about 1.1 hours [5].
We have seen that the coronavirus can go airborne
staying suspended in the air. However, the virus is
transmitted through respiratory droplets and droplet
nuclei produced mostly while sneezing and coughing.
Then to ascertain whether airborne transmissible SARSCoV-2 can survive and stay infectious in aerosols we
must double-check that the falling time of a droplet or a
droplet nuclei from a height of about two meters is larger
than its evaporation time scale. To this end, we assume
that the drops are also spherical and hence the mass can
be simply estimated as
m=

(3)

where ρ = 997 kg/m3 is the density of water and r the
droplet/aerosol radius. For large droplets whose diameters & 1000 µm, the effect of air resistance is negligible and so the falling time can be directly estimated using Newton’s equations for gravitational settling. For
smaller droplets whose diameters < 100 µm, the falling
times must instead be determined using the downward
terminal speed given in (1) to account for the air resistance upon the falling droplets. It is now an instructive
and straightforward exercise to show that the time for
falling 2 m in saturated air is 0.6 s for droplets with
r > 500 µm, 6.0 s for those of r ∼ 50 µm, 600 s (about
10 minutes) for those of r ∼ 5 µm, and 60,000 s (about
16.6 hours) for those of r ∼ 0.5 µm. The droplet evaporation time scale, as computed by Wells using droplet

evaporation data collected by Whytlaw-Gray and Patterson, is shown in Table I [14]. The assumption of pure
water droplets in unsaturated air at 18◦ C was used for
the evaporation calculations, such that the theoretical
droplets are capable of complete evaporation. By direct comparison of the droplet evaporation and falling
times we can conclude that somewhere between 100 and
200 µm lies the droplet size (i.e. the diameter) which
identifies droplets of mouth spray that reach the ground
within the life of the droplet as against droplets that
evaporate and remain in the air as droplet-nuclei with
attached SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several investigations
have been carried out to continue improving the precision of Wells analyses and to study the various external
environmental (such as temperature and humidity) factors that may alter his estimates; see e.g. [15].
The sizes of the droplets and droplet-nuclei produced
by sneezing and coughing were studied by the microscopic measurement of 12,000 droplet stain-marks found
on slides exposed directly to mouth-spray, and of 21,000
stain-containing droplet-nuclei recovered from the air
on to oiled slides exposed in the slit sampler [16]. From
this data sample it was found that the original diameters of respiratory droplets ranged from 1 to 2000 µm
and that 95% were between 2 and 100 µm and that the
most common were between 4 and 8 µm. Similar results were reported in [17]. This suggest that, in principle, droplet-spray could drive direct airborne infection
of SARS-CoV-2. The transmission of the COVID-19 disease, however, still depends on the infectious virus load
carried by the droplets, which must be determined experimentally. The number of virions needed for infection
is yet unknown, but we can use other viral transmission
(e.g., influenza [18–20]) for a template. The spread of a
sneeze in the air has been studied by ultrafast imaging at
MIT [21–23]. It was found that even the largest droplets
from a sneeze can float in the air for up to 10 minutes,
which allows them to reach the far end of a large room.
This points towards convection in the air being the primary mechanism of the spread of the infection.
From the physics point of view, we cannot find a good
justification for a stationary 6-feet separation in a situation when people spend long time together in a room.
Small droplets or aerosols containing the virus move in
the air via convection. The convection pattern in a room
can be very complex; see Fig. 1. It depends on the location of air conditioners, radiators, windows, and all
items in the room, as well as on people producing vortices by moving around. The existing vortices in the
air can make a location far away from the source of the
virus more dangerous than the location 6 feet away. This
applies to meeting rooms, office spaces, supermarkets,
department stores, etc. The airflow pattern should be
studied for all such facilities to avoid the spread of infection to large distances from a single infected person. The
safest rooms must be those equipped with the air sucking
ventilator at the top, like hospital surgery rooms [24].
By all means, re-configuring the ventilation of public

infection can be taken by the airflow from one cubicle to the other. Simulation by SimScale [10].

and private facilities cannot be done within the timescale
of the pandemic. The question is what to do now if we
want to slow its pace. The answer is very simple. People
must be required to wear face masks in public spaces to
prevent the virus from becoming airborne in the first
place.

CONCLUSIONS

Airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads from infected
individuals and accumulates in confined spaces where
it can linger in the air in the aerosol form for hours. The
inhaled virus load depends on the virus concentration in
the air and the time of exposure. Concentration can vary
from one spot to another. It depends on the location of
the spreaders and the pattern of the airflow. The latter
is determined by many factors, such as the location of
doors and windows, ventilators, heaters, movement of
people, etc. Common central air conditioning system
that is cooling the indoor air but is not exchanging it
with the outside air and is not filtering the virus helps
to spread it across the airconditioned space. It can
easily take the virus to distant locations and make it
