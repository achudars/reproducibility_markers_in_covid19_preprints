Abstract
Covid-19 is one of the biggest health challenges that the world has ever faced.
Public health policy makers need the reliable prediction of the confirmed cases
in future to plan medical facilities. Machine learning methods learn from the
historical data and make a prediction about the event. Machine learning methods have been used to predict the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19. In
this paper, we present a detailed review of these research papers. We present
a taxonomy that groups them in four categories. We further present the challenges in this field. We provide suggestions to the machine learning practitioners
to improve the performance of machine learning methods for the prediction of
confirmed cases of Covid-19.

confirmed cases is increasing steadily. From 22nd January 2020 to 31st May 2020 [5]

reported in Wuhan, China in December 2020 [2]. Since then it has spread
all over the world. It was declared pandemic by World Health Organization
(WHO) on 11th March 2020 [3]. As on 4th June 2020, there were more than
6.5 million COVID-19 confirmed cases across 188 countries [4]. The fast spread
of the Covid-19 has put a lot of pressure on healthcare systems of countries.
Predicting the number of confirmed cases in future has become an important
task for the public health policy makers so that they can increase their medical facilities accordingly. It spreads differently in countries (Fig. 1 and Fig.
2). Different governments propose various measures such as lockdown, social
distancing, closing of schools etc. to slow down the spread of Covid-19. Effect
of different responses can be measured with accurate prediction models so that
the response can be modified to be more effective.
Different approaches are used for modelling infectious diseases. SusceptibleInfectious-Recovered model and its extensions Susceptible-Infectious-RecoveredDeceased-Model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-model etc. have been

applied to predict the spread of infectious diseases [6]. The models are generally based on ordinary differential equations. These models can also be used to
study the effect of public health interventions on the spread of infectious diseases. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to study modelling
of infectious diseases [7] .
In machine learning models are built using historical data and these models
are used to predict the new outcome. Regression, classification, clustering, deep
learning etc. [8, 9] are some of the machine learning methods which have been
successfully used in various domains such as image analysis, speech recognition,
health informatics etc.
Many applications of machine learning methods for Covid-19 have been proposed such as diagnosis and prognosis, patient outcome prediction, tracking and
predicting the outbreak, drug development, vaccine discovery, false news prediction, etc. [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Many machine learning models have been used

3

to model the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 [11, 12, 13]. In this paper,
we will review these machine learning models. There are other review papers
on the related topics, we present the detailed analysis of these review papers
and differentiate them from our paper. In this paper, we present a taxonomy
to identify four broad machine learning methodologies for predicting confirmed
cases of Covid-19. Using this taxonomy, we present the comprehensive review
of related published papers. We also present the challenges that have impacted
this area. We further present suggestions to improve the performance of the
machine learning models for the prediction of confirmed cases of Covid-19.
The paper is organized in following way. In the next section, we will discuss
published reviews on the applications of machine learning methods for Covid-19.
Section 3 will discuss various machine learning models to predict the number of
confirmed cases of Covid-19. Challenges are presented in Section 4. The paper
ends with suggestions to improve the accuracy of machine learning methods for
the prediction of Covid-19 confirmed cases.

2. Related review papers
A few review papers have been published that discuss applications of machine
learning methods or artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for Covid-19. In this
section, we will discuss these review papers. Naude [12] presents an early review
of the applications of AI techniques for Covid-19. Prediction of the confirmed
cases is one of the applications discussed in the paper. However, few related
papers are discussed. Bullock et al. [13] discuss some of the studies that apply
machine learning methods for handling Covid-19. They discuss some of the
papers that apply machine learning methods to forecast the spread of Covid19. Vaishya et al. [14] discuss some of the applications of AI techniques for
COVID-19 pandemic. They suggest that AI techniques can be used to predict
the number of cases, however, no related papers are reviewed. Pham et al. [11]
review the applications of AI and big data for COVID-19 pandemic. In this
paper, they review eight papers related with prediction of spread of Covid-19.

The study suggests that all the related review papers focus on many applications
of machine learning methods for Covid-19. Prediction of the confirmed cases is
not extensively covered in these papers. Our paper concentrates on only one
application of machine learning methods for Covid-19. We try to include all the
related papers majority of which are not covered in these review papers.

3. Taxonomy for machine learning methodologies for the prediction
of confirmed cases of Covid-19
The world is facing Covid-19 pandemic. The health policy makers need
reliable estimates of the confirmed cases in future to make informed decisions
about the required health facilities. They also want to estimate the effect of
public health interventions to mitigate the epidemic. Machine learning methods
have been applied to forecast the confirmed cases.
In this section, we will present a taxonomy to review the related published
papers. The taxonomy identifies four research themes- traditional machine
learning regression, deep learning regression, network analysis and social media and search queries data-based methods. There are some papers which may
belong to more than one research themes, we take utmost care to place them in
the most related research themes.
3.1. Traditional machine learning regression
Regression analysis is a supervised machine learning approach which estimates the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables. The independent variables are also called predictor variables [8]. These
relationships are learned from the given data and are used to predict. Some of
the regression analysis methods assume models and try to find the best parameters that fit the data to those models; for example multivariate linear regression
(Eq. 1) it is assumed that the dependent variable y is linearly dependent on j
predictor variables xi (i is 1 to j). The task is to find out the values of ai so
that the equation best fit the given data.

5

y=

j
X

ai xi + a0

(1)

i=1

These relationships can be nonlinear. For example polynomial regression of
order more than one, S-shaped logistic curve (Eq. 2);

Nt =

Nmax
1 + e−c(t−to )

(2)

where t is a predictor variable, Nmax is the maximum value of the curve,
t0 is the t value of the sigmoid’s midpoint, and c is the logistic growth rate.
With the given data, the best values of Nmax , t0 and c are estimated. Then the
equation is used to predict the number of curve, Nt , at given t.
These methods work well if the assumed models are correct otherwise the
performance may not be very accurate. Some of the machine learning methods
do not assume any relationships and can learn complex relationships between
predictor variables and dependent variable. Random forests [15] and neural
networks [8] come under this category.
In the prediction of confirmed cases of Covid-19 using regression methods
two approaches have been used.
1. Time series analysis - In this approach the confirmed cases against the
days curve is used for the prediction in the future. Two methodologies
have been used for this purpose.
• m previous days confirmed cases are used to predict the next day confirmed cases. A relationship is learned using multivariate regression
analysis which is used to predict the confirmed cases in the future
[16].
• A relationship such as logistic curve is learned to predict the number
of confirmed cases at a given day [17, 18].
2. The relationships between confirmed cases of Covid-19 and the other factors such as temperature, humidity etc. are leaned from the data and the

6

relationships are used to predict the number of confirmed cases with the
new values of the factors [19].
We will present the detailed review of traditional machine learning regression
methods for the confirmed cases of Covid-19. Gupta et al. [16] use polynomial
regression to predict the number of confirmed cases in India. They use data
from 30th January till 25th March 2020 as the training data and predict the
number of COVID-19 patients in India for next two weeks. Gu et al. [20] apply
cubic regression equations which uses the number of days as the input variable
to predict the conformed Covid 19 cases in China and world.
Pavlyshenko [17] apply logistic curve to model COVID-19 spread. Model parameters are computed using Bayesian regression approach. The author argues
that in the Bayesian inference, prior distributions can be set up by a Covid-19
expert which can be useful for small historical COVID19 datasets. Predictions
are made for confirmed COVID19 cases in different countries. Batista [21] use
logistic growth regression model to predict the the final size of the coronavirus
epidemic. They predict the final value around 90000 which is way below the
current value. Batista [22] does the similar calculation for final size of the second phase of the coronavirus using logistic model, the parameters of the logistic
model are computed using regression analysis. Ensembles are combinations of
accurate and diverse models, they generally perform better than single model
[23]. Buizza [24] create an ensembles of logistic curves to estimate the confirmed
cases. These diverse logistic curves are generated by perturbing the training
dataset. The model works well for China.
Petropoulos and Makridakis [25] predict the global spread of Covid-19 using models from the exponential smoothing family. These have shown great
prediction accuracy for short time series. Exponential smoothing models are
useful to capture various types of trends. This approach is opposite to S-Curve
(logistic curve) approach that assumes convergence. Stubinger and Schneider
[26] argues that the Covid-19 spread in China first and then other countries got
affected by it. Therefore, there are lead-lag effects between spreads of Covid-19

7

in different countries. The relationships can be exploited to predict the spread
of Covid-19 in other countries using the data of China. The relationships are
computed using dynamic time warping.
Tobias et al. [27] predict the number of the confirmed cases in the Italy and
Spain under lockdown using quasi-Poisson regression model. Interaction model
is applied to compute the variations in confirmed cases trends. Xu et al. [28]
apply a rolling growth curve approach (RGCA) to estimate the spread in USA.
The model uses the number of daily hospitalized COVID-19 patients as the
independent variable. The authors argue that the number of confirmed deaths
due to Covid-19 or the number of daily hospitalized COVID-19 patients is more
reliable than the reported number of COVID-19 cases. Li et al. [29] propose
a regression equation to predict the early spread of Covid-19 in China. In
this equation log value of the summation of confirmed cases and 34 is linearly
dependent on the days. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
is applied to forecast the number of conformed cases in China in the timeseries framework [30]. Enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) and salp
swarm algorithm (SSA) are used for selecting parameters of ANFIS. The results
suggest that the FPA and SSA perform better than the other parameter selection
methods.
Maier and Brockmann [18] demonstrate that the scaling law, number of
confirmed cases is proportional to (days)x , is universal for confirmed cases in
affected provinces in Mainland China universal, with a range of exponents (x) =
2.1 ± 0.3. They suggests that effective containment strategies can be the reason
for this behaviour. It is shown that all country-specific infection rates follow
a power law growth behaviour [31]. Different countries have different scaling
exponents. The authors calculate scaling exponents for different countries. It
is shown [32] that cumulative distribution function [33] can be used to predict
the spread of the Covid-19 using days as the predictor variable.
Gupta and Pal [34] investigate the application of ARIMA (Auto-Regressive
Integrated Moving Average) time series method for the prediction of confirmed
covid 19 cases in India. ARIMA model is used to estimate the spread in China,
8

Italy, South Korea, Iran and Thailand [35]. The model predicts stable trend in
China and Thailand in future whereas the model predicts that Iran and Italy
will have unstable trends in future. Using time-series framework, Chakraborty
and Ghosh [36] combine ARIMA model and Wavelet-based forecasting model
to generate ten days ahead estimates of Covid-19 spread in various countries.
Perc et al. [37] develop an iteration method to estimates the transmission
of Covid-19 that requires the daily values of confirmed cases as input. It accounts for expected recoveries and deaths using a parameter. Covid-19 spread
is predicted for various countries using the proposed model.
Lua et al. [38] apply linear regression to suggest that countries with lower
Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index may have larger number of unreported cases of Covid-19. Pirouz et al. [19] uses a group method of data
handling (GMDH) type of neural network [39] to investigate the relationship
between environmental and urban factors and the number of confirmed cases.
It is also shown using 42 datasets in four countries, including China, Japan,
South Korea, and Italy to show that there is a very low correlation between
them, therefore different models should be created for these datasets. Zhao et
al. [40] propose that the daily traffic from Wuhan and the total traffic in this
period can be used to estimate the spread in Chinese cities in January 2020.
Multiple regression models are developed which use number of passengers and
local population as predictor variables to explain the variance of the number
of cases in the infected cities. Ensembles of ten different machine learning algorithms are used to estimate the spread of Covid-19 using climate variables
(monthly mean temperature, interaction term between monthly minimum temperature and maximum temperature, monthly precipitation sum, downward
surface short-wave radiation, and actual evapotranspiration) [41].
Wang et al. [42] apply linear regression framework to suggest that high temperature and high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19.
They use data from china in their experiments. Oliveiros et al. [43] apply a linear regression model to study the effect of temperature, humidity, precipitation,
and wind speed on the doubling rate of COVID-19 spread in China.

3.2. Deep learning regression
Deep learning is generally related with artificial neural networks which mimic
human brain. Deep neural networks have large number of hidden layers [9].
Deep neural networks have shown excellent performance in various domains
image analysis, speech recognition, text analysis etc. Various types of deep
learning neural networks have been applied to predict the spread of Covid-19.
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network
architecture which is used to study a time series and predict the future events
[9]. Tomar and Gupta [44] investigate the use of LSTM for the number of confirmed cases in India. The predicted cases are very close to the official number
of cases. Hu et al. [45] use modified auto-encoders [46] to model Covid-19 time
series of confirmed cases in various Chinese cities. They use the trained model
to predict six-step to ten-step forecasting. Yang et al. [47] use LSTM to predict
the spread in China in Feb. 2020. The LSTM is trained using the SERS 2003
data. COVID-19 epidemiological parameters such as transmission probability,
incubation rate, etc. are incorporated in the model. The model predicts that
the number of confirmed cases in China should peak by late February. Fong et
al. [48] demonstrates that for small datasets polynomial neural network with
corrective feedback method outperform linear regression, support vector machines [8] and ARIMA methods. Deep learning-based Composite Monte-Carlo
simulation [49] is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques to predict the spread in China. Deep learning produces better fitted Monte Carlo
outputs which lead to a better prediction. It is demonstrated that the combination of LSTM and gated recurrent unit perform better than individual methods
to predict the confirmed cases in the world [50]. Nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks are used to predict the spread in many countries [51].
Huang et al. [52] demonstrate that convolutional neural networks [9] outperform
other deep learning models such as gated recurrent unit, LSTM and multilayer
perceptron in the prediction of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Chinese cities.

3.3. Network analysis
Networks or graphs consist of nodes and edges [53]. Nodes represent the
entities. Edges represent the connections between nodes. Analysis of graphs or
networks is an important research area of machine learning. Web mining, social
networks analysis, Community Detection etc. are some of the applications of
the networks analysis [53]. Humans are connected with other humans, therefore
they can be represented by networks. These networks have been used to study
the spread of the infectious diseases [53]. When one of nodes of a network gets
infected, it can infect other nodes which are connected to the infected node. This
process continues and the disease spread to the other nodes of the network. In
this section, we will discuss those papers that use network analysis to predict
the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19.
It has been observed that virological transmission usually satisfies the Gaussian distribution. Therefore, this is used to predict the Covid-19 transmission
[54], it is assumed that an infected person can infect 1 to ∞ persons. The model
is used to estimate the transmission in China and the other countries. Zhuang
et al. [55] use a stochastic model to estimate the confirmed cases in Republic
of Korea and Italy. In this model, it is assumed that the number of secondary
cases associated with a primary COVID-19 case follows a negative binomial distribution. The mean parameter represents the basic reproduction number of
COVID-19 whereas the dispersion parameter represents the likelihood of occurrence of other factors that can effect spread like super-spreading events. The
current growth closely follows power-law kinetics in China, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network (a small average shortest path length,
and a large clustering coefficient [53])of connections between susceptible and
infected individuals [56]. Li et al [57] demonstrate that the spread of Covid-19
closely follows a power-law kinetics in China during January 2020 to February
2020. It suggests that the underlying network has small-world property.
Herrmann and Schwartz [58] propose that network of interactions can be
used to estimate the spread of Covid-19. They use scale-free networks (a scalefree network’s degree distribution follow a power law) with Susceptible-Infected11

Susceptible model [59], with the model parameters computed for COVID-19.
Their results show that directly targeting hubs in the network is far more effective than randomly decreasing the number of connections between individuals.
It is shown that by transforming the time-series of COVID-19 infection curve
to a visibility graph one can study the time-series as a complex network [60].
Complex-network-based splines regression method is proposed for the prediction
of confirmed cases in Greece [61]. The proposed method outperforms both the
cubic regression model and the randomly-calibrated splines regression model.
Pujari and Shekatkar [62] propose a hybrid model to predict the spread of
Covid-19 in Indian cities. Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered models are created
for individual cities. The migration among cities are modelled using transportation networks. Indian aviation and railway networks are used as transportation networks. Biswas and Sen [63] use Susceptible-Infected-Removed model
of epidemic spreading on Euclidean networks to study space-time dependence
of Covid-19 spread in many countries. It is assumed that the disease can be
transmitted to a nearest neighbour and to some random other agent who is
connected with a probability decaying algebraically with the Euclidean distance
separating them.
Gross et al. [64] study the spatial dynamics of the COVID-19 in Hubei
and other provinces of China. It is demonstrated that power laws hold for
the number of confirmed cases in each province as a function of the province
population and the distance from Hubei.
Hybrid non-linear cellular automata (HNLCA) classifier is trained on different parameters such as movement of the people, various transmission rates,
vulnerable people in the region, etc. to estimate the spread in India [65]. Regression analysis is carried out to evaluate the relationship between migration
and the spread of Covid-19 in China [66]. Bivariate correlation analysis is used
to extract the strength of these relationships in various cities of China.

12

3.4. Social media and search queries data-based methods
Internet search queries and social media have emerged as rich sources of data.
This data is used to predict and monitor infectious diseases [67]. It is easy to
collect this data, however there is a problem of noisy data. Internet search
queries and social media have been used to predict the number of confirmed
cases of Covid-19, we will review these research works in this section.
Qin et al. [68] predict the number of Covid-19 cases by using social media
search indexes (SMSI) of Covid-19 symptoms (dry cough, fever, chest distress,
coronavirus, and pneumonia) collected from Baidu search engine data as the
independent variables. Five regression methods, subset selection, forward selection, lasso regression, ridge regression, and elastic net, are used to determine
the relationships between the number of Covid-19 cases and independent variables. The subset selection method produces the best result. Jahanbin and
Rahmanian [69] conclude that tweets extracted from twitter can be used to estimate the spread of Covid-19. Fuzzy rule-based evolutionary algorithm called
Eclass1-MIMO is used to model the spread. The results suggest that geographical origins of tweets posted about COVID-19 are consistent with the number
of confirmed cases of Covid-19.
ARGOnet [67] combines AutoRegression with General Online information
(ARGO) with spatio-temporal information about influenza activity to predict
influenza transmission. Liu et al. [70] apply AGROnet to predict Covid-19
cases, the model uses the data from official health reports from Chinese Center
Disease for Control and Prevention, Covid-19 related internet search activity
from Baidu, media activity reported by Media Cloud, and daily forecasts of
COVID-19 activity by an agent-based mechanistic model. They apply clustering
to get spatio-temporal Covid-19 information across Chinese provinces required
for AGROnet. ARGOnet outperforms an autoregressive model trained only on
historical confirmed cases.
Ayyoubzadeh et al. [71] use search statistics collected from Google Trends for
search queries related to COVID-19 such as Corona, COVID-19, Coronavirus,
hand washing, Antiseptic, etc. to predict the number of confirmed cases in
13

the next days in Iran. Linear regression and LSTM models are used for the
prediction. Linear regression model performs better.
Lampos et al. [72] use the data pertaining to google search queries and
basic news media coverage metric associated with Covid-19. Elastic net models
are trained using the data. The authors also study the transferability of their
models between countries. It is proposed that Twitter sentiment analysis can
be used to predict the spread of COVID19 Outbreak [73].

4. Challenges
Many machine learning methods have been used to predict the number of
confirmed cases of Covid-19. However, there are many challenges for the accurate prediction by machine learning methods. In this section, we will discuss
these challanges.
Time series framework is very popular in prediction of the confirmed cases.
In many countries the first case of Covid-19 came in January 2020 or after.
Therefore till 30th May 2020, the number of data points is less 150. It is
difficult to train accurate machine learning models with such small datasets.
Deep learning methods are successful because of large training data which is
not available for Covid-19 confirmed cases prediction task. It is difficult to
select proper architectures and parameters for deep learning neural networks
with small datasets.
The lack of historical data is a major problem. Pandemics are rare and the
characteristics of Covid-19 are different than other coronaviruses such as SARS
and MERS[74]. Therefore their data cannot be used for Covid-19.
It is argued that many countries are not doing enough testing [75]. Therefore,
it is impossible to have correct number of confirmed cases in these countries.
Training machine learning algorithms with datasets of poor quality will lead to
misleading conclusions.
Governments take different preventive steps such as lockdown, social distancing etc. to slow the spread of Covid-19. The effectiveness of these measures

14

are different in countries. Inclusion of the effects of these measures in machine
learning methods is a challenging task.
It has been estimated that about 80% of people with COVID-19 are mild
or asymptomatic cases [76]. Many of these people do not get tested, therefore
the numbers of confirmed cases in countries are not accurate. However, these
people contribute to the new cases. It makes creating accurate machine learning
models for Covid-19 confirmed cases a difficult task.
Social stigma attached to Covid-19 [77] in many countries force suspected
Covid-19 patients to stay away from medical facilities. Therefore, many confirmed cases are not recorded. However, they contribute to new confirmed cases.
Logistic curve regression have been applied to predict the number of the
confirmed caseas. It is shown that by using logistic curve regression, a realworld epidemic outbreak can be predicted reliably only in the short term [78].
Therefore, logistic curve regression may not produce accurate prediction for long
term.
Social media data has been applied for the prediction of Covid-19 cases.
This data is huge, however, the data is noisy. Search queries have been used to
predict the number of confirmed cases. However, many normal people also try
to find the information about Covid-19. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the
confirmed cases only on the basis of search queries. Furthermore, there is a vast
difference in Internet penetration is various countries. The number of Internet
users are vastly different in countries [79]. The amount of social media data and
search queries data is quite different in countries.Therefore, it is difficult to find
prediction models which may work for many countries.
Predicting the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 using network analysis
requires accurate estimation of the transmission of Covid-19 from one person
to another person. As Covid-19 is a new pandemic, all the characteristics of
this pandemic are not known. Hence, the predicted confirmed cases may not be
accurate.
Structures of networks also play an important roles in accurate prediction.
In a country the connections between nodes are dependent on the culture, en15

vironment, population density etc. Some of these factors such as culture are
difficult to quantify. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate the connections between nodes accurately. Furthermore, models in one country cannot be applied
to other countries easily as they have different factors.

5. Suggestions
We present some suggestions that can be used to address the challenges for
machine learning methods for the prediction of confirmed cases of Covid-19.
Machine learning methods have not been very successful because of the challenges discussed in the last section. Established epidemiological models, such as
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered models, have been successfully used for modelling infectious diseases. The hybrid models of machine learning algorithms
and epidemiological models will be a promising research area.
Machine learning experts should work with epidemiologists to understand
the data well and to select the parameters of machine learning methods for the
prediction of confirmed cases of Covid-19.
As it is difficult to predict the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 accurately from one type of data. Models trained on different types of data may be
combined to predict the number of confirmed cases.
Countries are at different stages of the pandemic. Therefore, data from one
country that are ahead in the epidemic curve may be used for other countries
in earlier stages of the epidemic curve. There have been some attempts in this
research direction [26]. Transfer learning deals with training a model for a given
problem and using it to related but different problem [80]. Transfer learning has
been applied for the prediction of confirmed cases by using the model trained on
data from one country in which is ahead in the epidemic curve to other countries
still in earlier stages of the epidemic curve [72]. More research is required in
this direction.
Some countries have better facilities of collecting data. This data can be
used for countries with less facilities of collecting data. The data should be

16

modified for the local context for better representation of a country.
In countries where social stigma attached with Covid-19 scare people from
taking medical help, new sources for data such as medicine buying pattern,
online-purchasing pattern, shopping pattern etc. should be investigated for the
prediction of covid-19 cases.
In this paper, we identified four major research themes to predict the number
of confirmed cases of Covid-19. We presented a comprehensive state-of-the-art
review of the related research papers within them. We discussed the challenges
in this research area and presented suggestions to address them. We believe
that the review paper will be helpful to the researchers to develop an in-depth
understanding of the research area. This paper may lead to generate novel
ideas of using machine learning methods for accurately predicting the number
of confirmed cases of Covid-19. This will be very beneficial to mankind.
