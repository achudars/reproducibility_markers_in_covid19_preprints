Virtual Screening of Plant Metabolites against Main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
and Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2: Therapeutics option of COVID-19

Abstract
Covid-19, a serious respiratory complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become one of the global
threat to human healthcare system. The present study evaluated the possibility of plant originated
approved 117 therapeutics against the main protease protein (MPP), RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) and spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 including drug surface analysis by using
molecular docking through drug repurposing approaches. The molecular interaction study revealed
that Rifampin (-16.3 kcal/mol) were topmost inhibitor of MPP where Azobechalcone were found most
potent plant therapeutics for blocking the RdRp (-15.9 kcal /mol) and S (-14.4 kcal/mol) protein of
SARS-CoV-2. After the comparative analysis of all docking results, Azobechalcone, Rifampin,
Isolophirachalcone, Tetrandrine and Fangchinoline were exhibited as the most potential inhibitory
plant compounds for targeting the key proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, amino acid positions; H41,
C145, and M165 of MPP played crucial roles for the drug surface interaction where F368, L371, L372,
A375, W509, L514, Y515 were pivotal for RdRP. In addition, the drug interaction surface of S proteins
also showed similar patterns with all of its maximum inhibitors. ADME analysis also strengthened the
possibility of screened plant therapeutics as the potent drug candidates against SARS-C with the
highest drug friendliness.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 pandemic situation has tremendously turned the entire world into a place of horrible death
tragedy. SARS-CoV-2, initially named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health
Organization (WHO) is the causative agent of the recent serious respiratory complications resulting
the COVID-19 pandemic [1,2,3,4]. Though the symptoms of COVID-19 infection appear after an
incubation period of approximately 5.2 days, the period from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to
death ranged from 6 to 41 days with a median of 14 days [5,6]. It has already completed its world tour,
and around 213 countries are now experiencing the deadly scene occurred by COVID-19 including
41, 52,670 infected patients and 2, 84,536 global death cases till 12th May, 2020 [7]. The scientific
community is racing to explore the effective remedy against this severe health complications, but till
to date there are no any potential therapeutics have been approved for clinical use [8].

There have been few key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that could be targeted as the vaccine or drug surface
[9]. Similar to SARS and MERS, non-structural proteins (e.g. 3-chymotrypsin-like protease
coronavirus main protease, papain-like protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase),
structural proteins (e.g. spike glycoprotein) and accessory proteins were investigated in the genome of
SARS-CoV-2 where non-structural proteins constitute two-thirds of the entire genome [10]. Among
the structural proteins, Nucleocapsid (N) protein is prerequisite for RNA genome assembly where
Membrane (M) and Envelope (E) proteins are associated in viral assembly in the host environment
[11]. Moreover, Spike (S) protein is mainly responsible for the viral entry into the host cell, and that
is why spike protein is now being considered as a major therapeutic target for drug and vaccines
against SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Again, The S protein interaction with the human ACE2 interface has been
revealed at the atomic level, and the efficiency of ACE2 usage was found to be a main factor of
coronavirus transmissibility in human to human [13]. On the contrary, coronavirus main protease (M
pro) or 3C-like proteinase (3CLP) was reported for their ability to cleave the polyproteins into
individual polypeptides that are required for replication and transcription [14]. The 3CLP is autocleaved initially from the polyproteins to become a mature enzyme leading the translation of the
messenger RNA [15]. Then the 3CLP cleaves all the 11 downstream non-structural proteins. As 3CLP
plays a vital role in the replication cycle of virus in the host, it has been reported as the attractive target
against the human SARS virus [16]. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, other key target protein of

SARS-CoV-2 catalyses the synthesis of viral RNA possibly with the support of other non-structural
proteins as co-factors [17,18,19].
The computational drug repurposing method could allow the immediate search of potential antiviral
therapy in case of re-emergence of viral infections as like as COVID-19 pandemic situation [20,21,22].
Computational drug repurposing has already been used to identify promising drug candidates for other
virus associated diseases like Dengue, Ebola, ZIKA, and influenza infections [23,24]. Most
importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 has shown evolutionary convergent relations with SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV, and the drug repurposing methods were also applied to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
[25,26,27]. Hence, extensive in silico studies were performed to identify potential drug candidates, for
example, Prulifloxacin, Bictegravir, Nelfinavir, and Tegobuvi, were identified as repurposing
candidates against COVID-19 by looking for drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main
protease [28]. Again, Nelfinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor was also predicted to be a potential
inhibitor of COVID-19 main protease by another computational-based study [29].
However, secondary metabolites from plant origin are found to show effective defence mechanism
against different deadly pathogens, and they have been widely used for conventional remedy to treat
a wide range of human diseases since the ancient period of human civilization [30,31,32]. In this
pandemic situation, researchers are trying find out the effective solution against COVID-19 where
plant metabolites could be a promising wings for screening out potential drug candidates. Even few
plant secondary metabolites have already been reported as effective against other coronaviruses
[33,34]. In the present study, a total of 117 plant based drug compound were screened out to check
their potentiality for blocking the three important key proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The main protease
proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were employed to
molecular docking study with the repurposed drug candidates from plant origin for find out the better
drug option towards the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Retrieval of SARS-CoV-2 main protease proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, spike
protein and acquisition of potential natural therapeutics

PDB structures of SARS-CoV-2 main protease proteins (6LU7, 6Y2E), RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (6M71) and spike protein (6VYB) were retrieved from RCSB Protein Data Bank [35].
Moreover, a total 117 plant based drugs were collected from PubChem database (Supplementary Table
1). Alpha-ketoamide (CID 6482451) were also retrieved from the PubChem database database
(https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) of NCBI [36].
2.2. Screening of natural therapeutics against the key viral proteins
Molecular docking is an effective approach for screening out potential therapeutics against specific
drug-targets of deadly pathogens [37,38]. The crystal structure of retrieved SARS-CoV-2 proteins
(complexed with inhibitors) were refined by PyMOL v2.0 software [39]. Unwanted molecules i.e.
water, ions, inhibitors were removed from the viral retrieved viral protein, and further employed to
molecular docking experiment with 117 natural therapeutics. AutoDock Vina software [40] to analyse
the binding affinity and interactive amino acids. Alpha-ketoamide, an inhibitor SARS-CoV-2 main
protease protein were used as a positive control in this study [41] and also docked against the target
proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The default parameters for grid box were set to 62 A° x 71 A° x 60 A° (x,
y and z) and center -25.389 A° x 15.333 A° x 56.865 A° (x, y and z) to perform the action. Moreover,
2D ligand-protein interaction diagrams were generated by LigPlot+ find out the involved amino acids
with their interactive position were identified in the docked complexes [42]. The ligand molecules’
interactions with the viral proteins were visualize and analyzed by Discovery Studio [43] and PyMOL
v2.0 software [44].
2.3. Structural insights of drug surface hotspot in the viral proteins
The drug surface hotspot of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were identified by analysing the docked structures
of each protein with the top most natural therapeutics by LigPlot+, PyMOL v.2.0 and Discovery Studio
software. Binding patterns of Azobechalcone, Rifampin, Isolophirachalcone, Tetrandrine,
Fangchinoline with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the results were allowed for the comparative structural
analysis of screened natural therapeutics. Furthermore, interactions of Alpha-ketoamide with the
studied proteins were also investigated.
2.4. Analysis of drug likeness property of top drug candidates
The ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) properties of top drug candidates
were analysed by SwissADME server [45]. The pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness property and

medicinal chemistry were assessed [46]. Default parameters were used to evaluate various
physiochemical parameters (Molar Refractivity, Molecular weight, TPSA), lipophilicity (Log Po/w
(WLOGP), Log Po/w (MLOGP), Log Po/w (XLOGP3), Log Po/w, (SILICOS-IT), Log Po/w
(iLOGP), Consensus Log Po/w), pharmacokinetics parameters (Log Kp; skin permeation) and water
solubility of the probable drug candidates [47]. The inhibition effects of these natural therapeutics with
different cytochromes P450s (CYP2C9, CYP2C19 CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6) were also studied.
In addition, admetSAR and OSIRIS Property Explorer were employed to evaluate the toxic or
undesired effects (i.e. mutagenicity, tumerogenecity) of the compounds [48,49,50].

3. Results

3.1. Screening of natural therapeutics against the key viral proteins
All of the retrieved natural therapeutics were employed for molecular docking against MPP, RdRp
and Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Table 2). The scoring function of AutoDock Vina
was utilized to predict the interaction between the ligands (therapeutics) and the proteins. The top five
inhibitors for each protein was identified based on their free binding energy. Results showed that
Rifampin had the highest negative binding energy (-16.3 kcal/mol) among top MPP inhibitors (Table
1). Azobechalcone (-14.6 kcal/mol), Isolophirachalcone (-13 kcal/mol), Amentoflavone (-12.8
kcal/mol) and Cepharanthine (-12.7 kcal/mol) docked with the MPP of SARS-CoV-2 were also
exhibited topmost place with a higher negative binding energy (<-12.7 kcal/mol) as well (Table 1).
While interacting with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, the most negative binding energy was scored by
Azobechalcone (-15.9 kcal /mol) following by Rifampin (-15.6 kcal/mol), Tetrandrine (-13.9
kcal/mol), Biflavone (-13.7 kcal/mol), Biflavone (-13.7 kcal/mol) (Table 2). Moreover,
Azobechalcone, Rifampin, Isolophirachalcone, Fangchinoline and Tetrandrine were found to be top
most natural inhibitors for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Azobechalcone required lowest energy
(-14.4 kcal/mol) to interact with the spike protein, while Rifampin, Isolophirachalcone, Fangchinoline
and Tetrandrine scored -13.7 kcal/mol , -12.8 kcal/mol, -12.6 kcal/mol and -12.5 kcal/mol respectively
(Table 3). However, Azobechalcone, Rifampin, Isolophirachalcone, Tetrandrine and Fangchinoline
were found to be most effective inhibitory natural compounds when the docking results were
compared for all three SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Figure 2 and Table 4). All of these plant based natural

inhibitors required minimum energy (not more than -12.3 kcal/mol) to interact with the studied protein
molecules.
3.2.Structural insights of drug surface hotspot in the viral proteins
The docking pattern and interacting amino acid residues with their respective position were analyzed
to unravel the binding sites of studied SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Rifampin were involved with the amino
acid H41, N142, S144, C145, H163, M165, E166, D187, R188, Q189 of MPP of SARS-CoV-2
(Figure 2). The position of H41, C145, and M165 were also crucial for the binding of Amentoflavone
(H41, C145, H164, M165, E166, D187, R188, Q189) and Cepharanthine (H41, N142, C145, M165,
E166, D187, R188, Q189) (Table 1). Azobechalcone, the top scorer among RdRp inhibitors, were
engaged by Y32, K47, L49, Y129, H133, N138, D140, T141, S709, T710, D711, K714, K780, N781
in the docked complex. Moreover, results revealed that 6 amino acid positions i.e. F368, L371, L372,
A375, W509, L514, Y515 were crucial for binding pattern of RdRP with Tetrandrine, Biflavone and
Fangchinoline ( Figure 3 and Table 2). Remarkably, binding patterns of spike protein with
Isolophirachalcone (R355, Y396, P426, D428, F429, T430, K462, P463, F464, F515), Fangchinoline
(R355, Y396, P426, N428, P463, F464, S514, F515, E516) and Tetrandrine (R355, Y396, P426, N428,
P463, F464, S514, F515, E516) were exactly similar as all 9 amino acid residues i.e. R355, Y396,
P426, N428, P463, F464, S514, F515, E516 were critical for binding with the protein (Figure 4).
However, an additional residue T430 were involved in case of Isolophirachalcone (Table 3). P426,
D428, T430, P463, F464 and F515 were also critical for binding pattern of Rifampin and SARS-CoV2 spike protein.
3.3.Analysis of drug likeness property of top drug candidates
The most potent MPP, RdRp and spike protein inhibitors (Azobechalcone, Rifampin,
Isolophirachalcone, Tetrandrine and Fangchinoline) were investigated in the spheres of
physicochemical parameters, lipophilicity, pharmacokinetics and water solubility (Table 5).
Lipophilicity, partition coefficient between n-octanol and water (log Po/w) were also calculated by
using five widely available predictive models (XLOGP3, WLOGP, MLOGP, SILICOS-IT, iLOGP).
GI absorption was lower for all the drug candidates. Azobechalcone, Rifampin, Isolophirachalcone,
Tetrandrine and Fangchinoline molecules had no repressive action with the P450 (CYP) isoforms
(CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4). Moreover, no permeant BBB exists among the
protein inhibitors of MPP, RdRp and Spike. The compounds sowed water solubility from moderate to

high level i.e. 1.30e-16 mg/ml, 1.50e-02 mg/ml, 1.18e-10 mg/ml, 9.78e 09 mg/ml, 4.61e-08 mg/ml,
respectively (Table 5). The toxicity analysis of these inhibitors showed that there were no carcinogenic
effect and organ toxicity. However, Rifampin, Tetrandrine and Fangchinoline were slightly positive
in terms of mutagenesis though Azobechalcone and Isolophirachalcone inhibitors were completely
negative. Among the top five inhibitors Azobechalcone was listed in the acute oral toxicity category
2 and rest of them were listed in the category 3.

4. Discussion
Global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a major concern due to its excessive infection
rate and lethality [51,52,53,54]. Despite huge research regarding the pathogen, no drugs or vaccine
has proven satisfactory to combat infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 [55,56]. Several investigational
drugs exist, however none of these could treat the patients unquestionably. Moreover, lack of rapid
detection procedures made SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis troublesome [57]. Computational approach and
drug repurposing strategies hold promise to face such challenges caused by SARS-CoV-2. Hence, in
the present study, attempts were taken to suggest probable drug candidates by checking the efficacy
of natural inhibitors to inhibit the key proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
The race against the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed the drug repurposing through virtual for
finding drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Recent studies prioritized MPP
inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 i.e. alpha-ketoamide, Hydroxy, Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Favipiravir
to evaluate their potency as drug [58,59,60]. Several in silico approach was also adopted to screen
putative drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 [61,62]. However, all these experiments used either
main protease proteins or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 as probable drug
targets. In this study, we screened potential natural therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 MPP, RdRp
and spike protein by molecular docking approach. Here, Rifampin, Azobechalcone and
Azobechalcone were determined as top most drug candidates as they interacted with SARS-CoV-2
MPP, RdRp and spike protein with lowest negative binding energy had the highest negative binding
energy (-16.3 kcal/mol, -15.9 kcal /mol and -14.4 kcal/mol respectively. However, comparative
analysis revealed the superiority of 5 drug candidates i.e. Azobechalcone, Rifampin,
Isolophirachalcone, Tetrandrine, Fangchinoline against SARS-CoV-2 (Table 4). The common drug

surface hotspots were analyzed along with modeling of pharmacophore which is very important step
for drug discovery. Three amino acid residues i.e. H41, C145, and M165 played the crucial role for
the interaction of MPP with its inhibitors (i.e. Rifampin, Amentoflavone, Cepharanthine) (Table 1).
Azobechalcone, the top scorer among RdRp inhibitors, Again, the position of F368, L371, L372,
A375, W509, L514, Y515 were vital for binding of RdRP with Tetrandrine, Biflavone and
Fangchinoline (Table 2). Most importantly, the binding patterns of spike protein with
Isolophirachalcone, Fangchinoline and Tetrandrine were significantly similar. This study revealed
the possibility of these amino acids to efficiently interact with drugs, though requires validation in
wet lab trials. ADME analysis of top drug candidates reveled no undesirable consequences by these
compounds. Various physico-chemical parameters, lipophilicity, pharmacokinetics properties and water
solubility were determined (Table 5). In addition, no BBB permeant were identified among the top most

inhibitors of MPP, RdRp and spike protein. The consequence of association of the natural inhibitory
drugs of three key proteins with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) suggests that no substantial inhibition
can occur. However, toxicity analysis revealed that Rifampin, Tetrandrine and Fangchinoline can be
slightly mutagenic, though there was no possibility for organ toxicity.

The results suggest that Azobechalcone, Rifampin, Isolophirachalcone and Tetrandrine, Fangchinoline
could be an option to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the study employed various
computational approaches to screen the potent natural therapeutics and does not involve in-vivo assay.
Currently investigational drugs of SARS-CoV-2 are under immense experimental evaluation.
Therefore, we suggest clinical trials for the experimental validation of our findings.

Conclusion
COVID-19 pandemic situation is going to be a worst condition throughout the world. Rapid detection
and social distancing are being encouraged at this stage, but we need to search for immediate
therapeutic options and effective vaccine candidates for battling this serious health crisis. Drug
repurposing approaches could screened out the already approved drugs for reusing against any serious
causative agents that are causing health complications. Plant metabolites based repurposed drug
molecules could be a promising options against SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, five plantr based

therapeutics such as Azobechalcone, Rifampin, Isolophirachalcone, Tetrandrine and Fangchinoline
were suggested for potential inhibitors for the Main Protease protein, RNA dependent RNA
polymerase and Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 by using molecular docking based virtual screening
study. The study initiated the window towards the thinking of plant based therapy against COVID-19,
though extensive research and wet lab validation needs to make it usable for patient.
