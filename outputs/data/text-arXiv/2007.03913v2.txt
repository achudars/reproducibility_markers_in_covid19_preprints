Abstract
We propose a time-fractional compartmental model (SEIA IS HRD) comprising
of the susceptible, exposed, infected (asymptomatic and symptomatic), hospitalized, recovered and dead population for the COVID-19 pandemic. We study
the properties and dynamics of the proposed model. The conditions under which
the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are asymptotically stable are
discussed. Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of the parameters and use
the data from Tennessee state (as a case study) to discuss identifiability of the
parameters of the model. The non-negative parameters in the model are obtained by solving inverse problems with empirical data from California, Florida,
Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The basic
reproduction number is seen to be slightly above the critical value of one suggesting that stricter measures such as the use of face-masks, social distancing,
contact tracing, and even longer stay-at-home orders need to be enforced in
order to mitigate the spread of the virus. As stay-at-home orders are rescinded
in some of these states, we see that the number of cases began to increase almost immediately and may continue to rise until the end of the year 2020 unless
stricter measures are taken.

1. Introduction
Fractional differential equations (FDEs) are used to model complex phenomena such as such as the modeling of memory-dependent phenomena (Di
Giuseppe et al. [1], Baleanu et al. [2], Podlubny [3]), mechanical properties
of materials (Caputo and Mainardi [4]), anomalous diffusion in porous media
(Fomin et al. [5], Metzler and Klafter[6]), groundwater flow problems (Cloot

and Botha [7], Iaffaldano et al. [8]), and control theory (Podlubny [9]), among
others. They serve as a generalization of the integer-order differential equations and give more degree of freedom for modeling of biological and physical
processes. FDEs have been applied in biological tissues [10], DNA sequencing
[11], Pine Wilt disease [12], lung tissue mechanics and models [13] , harmonic
oscillators [14], Dengue fever [15], measles [16], human liver [17], diffusion processes [18], SEIR models [19]. Infectious disease outbreaks are one of the main
causes of deaths in human. Their dynamics and spread are modeled and studied before the introduction of vaccines. COVID-19 began in December 2019 in
China. Over the last few months, it has spread rapidly leading to over 400,000
deaths across the globe. The first occurrence in the United States was seen
around mid January in Washington [20] and has spread across America with
over 100,000 deaths and 1.5 million infected. The pandemic has disrupted the
day-to-day activities of the human life with over six million jobs lost in the
United States. Several actions and measures have been taken by the federal,
state and local governments to mitigate the spread of the pandemic. The most
prominent measures taken include social distancing, testing, use of face-masks
and contact tracing. It is important to model this pandemic in order to better
understand the spread and dynamics as well as address the challenges of the
pandemic. In short, mathematical models are important to guide the decisions
of health and government officials.
The goal of this study is to examine and analyze the spread of the pandemic using a modification of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model
with a time-fractional derivative. The use of fractional derivatives in the model
stems from the fact that the spread of infectious diseases depends not only on
the current state but also on its past states (history or memory dependency).
Additionally, time-fractional order models reduce errors resulting from neglect
of parameters in models. We shall focus on some selected states in the US. We
note that models that consider the US as a whole may be misleading and have
limited applicability as different states have different economical and political
perspectives which determines the different control strategies used for each state.
For example, while some states such as Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, among others, enforced the use of masks in public places and longer
stay-at-home order [21], other states do not enforce these measures thereby allowing for a possibility of increase of infected individuals in such states. There
have been several models for the study of the pandemic. Lu et al. [22] considered
a fractional-order SEIHDR model which incorporates intercity movements. Liu
et al. [23] studied the dynamics of the pandemic by considering asymptomatic
and symptomatic infected populations separately. Giordano et al. [24] studied
the COVID-19 epidemic with intervention strategies in Italy. They proposed
a model consisting of different stages: susceptible, infected, diagnosed, ailing,
recognized, threatened, healed and extinct. They further discuss the long time
behavior of the populations in which the susceptible, healed and extinct population remains. Stella et al. [25] studied the role of asymptomatic individuals
via complex networks. In particular, they formulated a model which aims at
studying the interactions in the population by means of complex networks. They
2

further extended the model to a structured nonhomogenous version by means of
the Watts-Strogatz complex network. Wu et al. [26] studied domestic and international spread of the pandemic by using different data sets. Zhao and Chen [27]
discussed the dynamics of the pandemic by considering the Susceptible, unquarantined infected, quarantined infected and Confirmed infected (SUQC) model
and parametrize the intervention effect of control measures. Zhang et al. [28]
considered a fractional SEIR model with different order of the time-fractional
derivative for each of the different population being studied. Tuan et al. [29]
proposed a fractional-order model using the Caputo derivative for studying the
transmission of COVID-19. They discussed the existence and uniqueness of
solutions to the proposed model. They further used the generalized AdamsBashforth-Moulton method for simulating the model. Bahloul et al. [30] proposed a fractional-order Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined- RecoveredDeath-Insusceptible (SEIQRDP) model for predicting the spread of COVID-19.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we give
some preliminary results and definitions from fractional Calculus. Furthermore,
we discuss the formulation of the model by considering seven compartments:
Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic infected-Symptomatic infected, Hospitalized, Recovered and Dead populations (SEIA IS HRD). Section 3 details the properties and theoretical analysis of the model. Section 4 discusses the parameter
sensitivity and identifiability analysis. In section 5, we applied the model to observed data for some selected states in the US. In particular, this section details
solving several inverse problems for parameter estimation and computation of
the basic reproduction number. Finally, we give some concluding remarks in
Section 6.

2.2. Model Formulation
The model discussed in this work is a modification of the SEIR model having
three additional compartments. We consider a SEIA IS HRD compartmental
model which comprises of the susceptible, exposed, infected (asymptomatic and
symptomatic), hospitalized, recovered and dead population. We assume that
the natural death and birth rates are the same. We further assume that deaths
in the S and R compartments are due to natural deaths and deaths in the other
compartments are as a result of the pandemic. The schema below shows the
transmission flow of the model.

= ρH(t) − b1 R(t),
= µ1 E(t) + µ2 IA (t) + µ3 IS (t) + µ4 H(t).

The system has the associated initial data
S(0) = S0 ≥ 0,

E(0) = E0 ≥ 0,

IA (0) = IA0 ≥ 0,

IS (0) = IS0 ≥ 0,

H(0) = H0 ≥ 0,

R(0) = R0 ≥ 0,

D(0) = D0 ≥ 0.
The total population is N which is further divided into S(t), E(t) , IA (t), IS (t),
H(t) and R(t), b1 is the natural birth rate, βA and βS are the transmission rates
to the susceptible population from the asymptomatic and symptomatic populations, respectively. 1/σ is the incubation period of an exposed individual, η
denotes the fraction of the exposed population that becomes asymptomatic after
the incubation period and the remaining (1 − η) of the population are symptomatic. γ1 and γ2 are the infectious rates of an asymptomatic and a symptomatic individual, respectively. ρ is the recovery rate through hospitalization
5

and, µ1 , µ2 , µ3 and µ4 are the mortality rates of the exposed, asymptomatic,
symptomatic and hospitalized populations, respectively. We note that the death
population in the model comprises of deaths during exposure µ1 E(t), infectious
period (µ2 IA and µ3 IS ) and hospitalization µ4 H, and assume that deaths due
to other natural occurrences are negligible for this populations.
We note that the parameters of the model are non-negative and have dimensions given by 1/timeα . This observation was originally noted in Diethelm [15].
To alleviate this difference in dimensions, we replace the parameters (except η)
with a power α of new parameters to obtain the new system of equations

3.1. Stability Analysis
3.1.1. Computation of the basic reproduction number R0
We shall use the next generation matrix originally proposed by Diekmann
et al. [33] and further elaborated on by van den Driesche and Watmough [34]
and Diekmann et al. [35] to determine R0 . The disease-free equilibrium point
(DFE) is (N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). Now, consider the four compartments Y = (Y1 , Y2 , Y3 , Y4 ) =
(E, IA , IS , H) containing the infected individuals and let Y ∗ be the DFE point.
Since the DFE point exists and is stable (shown in the next section) in the
absence of any disease, then the linearized equation at the DFE is
α
0 Dt Yi

= Fi (Y ) − Vi (Y ), i = 1(1)4,

where Fi (Y ) is the rate of appearance of new infections in compartment i and
Vi (Y ) is the rate of transfer of infections to and from compartment i. We further
define
∂Vi (Y )
∂F(Y )
and V =
, i, j = 1(1)4.
F =
∂Yj Y =Y ∗
∂Yj Y =Y ∗
Then ρ(F V −1 ) is the basic reproduction number R0 , where ρ(x) is the spectral
radius of x and F V −1 is the next generation matrix. For the system (2),

4. Parameter Sensitivity and Identifiability Analysis
We discuss the sensitivity and identifiability of the parameters with respect
to the proposed model.
4.1. Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis (SA) deals with the significance or importance of the
parameters in the model. In particular, it finds the most influential parameters
that drives the dynamics of the model. It also describes the extent to which
parameter changes affects the result of the methods or models with the goal of
identifying the best set of parameters that describes the process or phenomena
in question.
There are several SA methods which are broadly classified as local and global
methods. In this work, we shall focus on the Morris screening method (local
method) and Sobol analysis method (global method).
4.1.1. Morris Screening Method
The Morris screening method is a local sensitivity measure that makes use
of the first order derivative of an output function y = f (θ) = f (θ1 , · · · , θp ) with
respect to the input parameter θ. It measures the effect of the output when the
input variable is perturbed one at a time around a nominal value. It serves as
a first check, in most analysis, in screening parameters for identifiability. The

8

method evaluates elementary effects [36, 37, 38] with the ith parameter through
the forward perturbation
gi (θ) =

f (θ1 , θ2 , · · · , θi + ∆θi , · · · , θp ) − f (θi , · · · , θp )
,
∆θi

i = 1(1)p

Morris [39] proposed two sensitivity measures, the mean (µ) and the standard
deviation (σ̃) of the elementary effects. For non-monotonic models, µ may lead
to a very small value due to cancellation effects. For this reason, Campolongo
et al. [40] proposed the use of absolute values for evaluating the mean. In order
to obtain a dimension-free sensitivity, we prefer the use of the sensitivity measure
δ given in Brun et al. [41] as
v
u
N
u1 X
g̃ 2 ,
i = 1(1)p, and j = 1(1)N,
δi = t
N j=1 ij
where N is the number of sample points and
g̃i (θ) =

θi
f (θ1 , θ2 , · · · , θi + ∆θi , · · · , θp ) − f (θ1 , · · · , θp )
.
∆θi
f (θ1 , · · · , θp )

A common practice in the literature [42, 43, 38] is to plot the indices δ against σ̃,
the standard deviation. We see from Fig. 2(a) that the fractional order α has the
highest influence on the model output over time. The transmission rates for the
symptomatic and asymptomatic populations and, the fractional parameter η are
the next most influential parameters in the model. This is further corroborated
by Fig. 2(b). The four parameters (α βS , βA and η) denoted by red squares are
the most important parameters, that is they have the largest δ and σ̃ values.
The parameters (b1 , ρ, µ1 , µ2 , µ3 and µ4 ) represented by the blue squares have
the least influence on the model output and can be considered unimportant.
The other parameters represented by the green squares have more influence
than the parameters represented by the blue squares.
One major setback of the Morris screening test for sensitivity analysis is the
consideration of each parameter individually and independently of the other
parameters. In real applications, this is not true as parameters have collinearity
and dependencies on one another.

4.1.2. Sobol Analysis
The Sobol method is a variance-based sensitivity analysis method which unlike the Morris screening method takes into account the effect of the relationship
between each parameters of the model. It uses the decomposition of variance to
calculate Sobol’s sensitivity indices: first and total order sensitivity measures.
The basic idea of the Sobol’s method is the decomposition of the model output
function y = f (θ1 , · · · , θp ) into summands of increasing dimensionality, that is
V (y) = V1,··· ,p +

p
X

Vi +

i=1

i=1 j>1

where Vi is the partial variance of the contribution of the parameter θi and Vi,··· ,s
is the partial variances caused by the interaction of the parameters (θ1 , · · · , θs )
for s ≤ p.
The first order sensitivity index measures the main effect of parameter θi on the
model output; that is the partial contribution of θi to the variance V (y).The

10

index [44, 45] is defined as
Si =

Vi
.
V (y)

The larger this index, the more sensitive the parameter is to the model output
[44, 45]. Using the law of total variances [45, 38], the index can also be expressed
as
V (y) = Vθi (Eθ∼i (y|θi )) + Eθi (Vθ∼i (y|θi ))
and
Si =

Vθi (Eθ∼i (y|θi ))
V (y)

where Vθi (Eθ∼i (y|θi )) is the partial variance caused by θi and Eθ∼i (y|θi ) is
the mean of the model output calculated by using all the values of the other
parameters θ∼i (except θi ) and V (y) is the total variance.
The total sensitivity indices [46] measures the effects of parameter θi and the
interaction with the other parameters. It is defined as
STi =

Vi + Vi,j + · · · + Vi,j,··· ,p
.
V (y)

The total variance, V (y), for this index is given as
V (y) = Vθ∼i (Eθi (y|θ∼i )) + Eθ∼i (Vθi (y|θ∼i ))
and
Eθ∼i (Vθi (y|θ∼i ))
V (y)
V (y) − Vθ∼i (Eθi (y|θ∼i ))
=
.
V (y)

STi =

The mean and the variance can be evaluated using quasirandom sampling
method [47, 38] and are given as
Vθi (Eθ∼i (y|θi )) =

N


f (Bj ) f (AiB,j ) − f (Aj ) ,
N j=1

and
Eθ∼i (Vθi (y|θ∼i )) =

N

1 X
f (Aj ) − f (AiB,j ) ,
2N j=1

where A and B are two independent parameter sample matrices of dimensions
N × p. We shall use the python SALib package [48] to compute the first and
total order variance indices. Fig. (3) shows that the fractional order βS has the
highest interaction with the other parameters. These results are consistent with
the results in the Morris screening test as important parameters of the test show
high interaction with the other parameters.

4.2. Parameter Identifiability
The concept of identifiability is dependent on sensitivity. It entails the selection of the subset of parameters of a model having little or no collinearity
and uncertainty, and which can be identified uniquely from a given set of observed data or measurements. In other words, it answers the question ”Can the
available data be described by the model and the selected subset of parameters?”. There are several techniques or tests for parameter identifiability. Most
of the tests are based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) F = χT χ where
χ = ∂y/∂θ for a model output function y. Cobelli and Di Stefano [49] showed
that a sufficient condition for identifiability is the non-singularity of FIM. Burth
et al. [50] proposed an iterative estimation process which implements a reducedorder estimation by finding parameters whose axis lie closest to the direction
of FIM. The associated parameter values are then fixed at prior estimates during the iterated process. Brun et al. [41] studied parameter identifiability using
two indices; a parameter importance ranking index δ and a collinearity index γK
which depends on the smallest eigenvalues of submatrices of χT χ corresponding
to the parameter subset K. Cintrón-Arias et al. [51] explained the need for
a good parameter subset for identifiability to satisfy the full rank test. They
further introduced two indices; the selection score and the condition number of
χT χ. The smaller these indices the lesser the collinearity and uncertainty in
the parameter values of the subset. Finally, they used the coefficient of variation index to examine the effect of parameters in the parameter subset. In this
work, we shall use the test proposed by Cintrón-Arias et al. in identifying the
parameters. The algorithm can be summarized in the following steps

Algorithm 1 Algorithm for Parameter subset Selection [51]
1:

Perform a combinatorial search for all possible parameter subsets. Let
Sp = {θ = (λ1 , λ2 , · · · , λp ) ∈ Rp λk ∈ I and λk 6= λm ∀ k, m = 1, · · · , p},

2:

where I = {b1 , βA , βS , σ, γ1 , γ2 , ρ, µ1 , µ2 , µ3 , µ4 , η, α}.
Select parameter subsets that pass the full rank test; that is
Θp = {θ θ ∈ Sp ⊂ Rp , Rank(χ(θ)) = p}.

For each θ ∈ Θp , calculate the parameter selection score ζ(θ) = |ϑ(θ)| where

and Σ(θ) = σ02 χT (θ)χ(θ)
∈ Rp .
4: Calculate the condition number κ(χ(θ)) for each parameter subset θ ∈ Θp .
The smaller the values of κ(χ(θ)) and ϑ(θ), the lower the uncertainty possibilities in the estimate.

3:

To discuss the results in this section, we shall use the state of Tennessee
as a case study to understand parameter identifiability. Furthermore, we used
the following values obtained using a random search algorithm as the nominal
parameter set θ0 for the model:
b1 = 8.0316e-07, βA = 1.0000e-10, βS = 1.2312e+00, σ = 9.9618e-01,
γ1 = 2.6628e-02, γ2 = 1.0000e+00, ρ = 6.1740e-03, µ1 = 3.3491e-03,
µ2 = 1.0000e-10, µ3 = 3.0859e-04, µ4 = 2.1222e-05, η = 1.5683e-01,
α = 1.0000e+00
and the nominal error variance σ0 = 10. We further divide the parameters into
three groups according to their importance rankings discussed in the previous
section:
S1 = (βA , βS , η, α),
S2 = (σ, γ1 , γ2 ),
S3 = (b1 , ρ, µ1 , µ2 , µ3 , µ4 ),
where S1 and S3 are the most and least influential parameter sets, respectively,
while S2 contains more influential parameters than S3 . We display some selections of the parameter subsets of size p in Table 1 where we have chosen the
subsets with the smallest score values. The entries in Table 1 are ordered with
respect to the selection score ϑ(θ) for each subset of same cardinality. A high
selection score and condition number for a parameter subset indicates substantial collinearity and linear dependence, and thus is poorly identifiable even if

N × p sensitivity matrices for all parameter subsets θ = Θp with p = 2. Logarithmic scales
are used on both axis

the parameter subsets contains S1 , that is contains the set of most influential
parameters. We observe that most of the selections in Table 1 contains at least
one element in each of the groups listed above. This shows that while parameter
importance ranking is crucial in identifying parameters that drives the dynamics
of a model, it does not have substantial effect in identifiability. Identifiability
depends on proper selection of subsets including parameters in each of the three
groups above that describes the measurement or data.
To have an idea of the variations of the condition number and the selection
score, we give a plot of these values for p = 2 in fig. 4 (with logarithmic scales).
Good parameter combination in fig. 4 corresponds to values in the lower left
corner of the figure where the values, ϑ(θ) and κ(χ(θ)), are relatively small.

Table 1: Selection scores and condition numbers for some selected parameter subsets

To further analyze the parameter identifiability of the model, we consider
the parameters subsets:
θ1 = (b1 , βA , βS , σ, γ1 , γ2 , ρ, µ1 , µ2 , µ3 , µ4 , η, α),
θ2 = (b1 , βS , σ, γ1 , γ2 , ρ, µ1 , µ3 , µ4 , η, α),
θ3 = (βS , σ, γ1 , γ2 , ρ, µ1 , µ4 , η, α),
θ4 = (βS , γ1 , γ2 , ρ, µ4 , η, α),
θ5 = (γ1 , γ2 , ρ, µ4 , α),
θ6 = (γ1 , γ2 , ρ, α),
θ7 = (γ2 , ρ, α)
such that θi+1 ⊂ θi , i = 1, · · · , 6. The choice of these parameter subsets are
due to their relative small condition numbers and selection scores. In other
to create synthetic data, we assume the nominal parameter subsets and error
variance (given at the beginning of this section) to be the true parameter vectors
and true variance. Furthermore, we add random noise to the model output as
follows:
Yj = z(tj , θ0 ) + σ0 N (0, 1), j = 1, · · · , N.
We solve seven inverse problems for each of the parameter subsets θi , i =
1, · · · , 7. We analyze the result using the coefficient of variation and standard
error [51] given as

From Table 6, it is seen that the parameters (µ2 , µ3 ) ⊂ θ1 have standard
errors that is approximately 20 times their estimates. This shows substantial uncertainty in these parameter values and any parameter subset containing these
parameters may result in illogical parameter estimation from observations. The
standard errors of βS , γ1 , ρ, µ3 , µ4 , η, α in θ2 show improvements and implies
lower linear dependence and collinearity for parameters in θ2 than those in θ1 .
Thus, a substantial improvement in uncertainty quantification is seen from θ1
to θ2 . Further improvements are observed for each of the other parameter subsets as more parameters are removed. For instance, with the removal of βS and
η in θ4 , it seen that the standard error for γ1 and γ2 dropped from 4% and
1% to approximately 0.07% and 0.003%, respectively, of their estimates. Other
improvements in θ5 include α where the standard error is reduced to at least
one-tenth of its standard error in θ4 . We note that there is no substantial gain
in the removal of µ4 from θ5 and γ1 in θ6 as seen in Table ??.
Parameter identifiability might be misleading without the investigation of the
residual of the model [51]. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) indices make use of residuals to determine the quality of models in the presence of a given set of data. Table 2 shows the AIC and
BIC estimates for each parameter set θi , i = 1, · · · , 7. It is seen that the best
improvements occur from θi to θi+1 for i = 2, 3. Thus, the best case scenario of
uncertainty quantification obtained for this analysis is that of θ4 .
Finally, we present results in Table 3 obtained from solving the inverse problem
for θ4 using the data given in [52]. The remaining parameters are fixed using the
nominal parameters above and T ∗ is the number of days used in the simulation

5. Results and Discussions
Seven inverse problems for California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Texas,
Washington and Wisconsin were solved to estimate the full parameter sets of
the model. As seen in fig. 5, the fits are reasonably good even for states like
Tennessee and Wisconsin whose current infected population begins to flatten.
Table 7 (see Appendix) shows the fit parameter sets for each of the states with
T ∗ being the number of days used in the simulation. We see that the conα
tact rates βA
and βSα for the asymptomatic and symptomatic population lies
within 0.5–1.5 days−1 , a range suggested by Li et al. [53], Read et al. [54], Shen
et al. [55], Eikenberry et al. [56]. The incubation period 1/σ α is seen to be relatively small, around 1–2 days. The average length of active infection 1/γ1α and
1/γ2α of the asymptomatic and symptomatic population, respectively, is seen
to be around 1–27 days which is in line with suggested range of days in the
literature [57, 58]. The recovery rate via hospitalization is seen to be very small
for California, Florida, Georgia and Washington where the data records little or
α
α
α
no recovery at all for infected patients. The death rates µα
1 , µ2 , µ3 , µ4 from the
exposed, asymptomatic infected, symptomatic infected and hospitalized compartments are seen to be relatively small ranging from 0–0.01 day−1 . With a
µα
4 value of around 0, Florida and Georgia has no death from the hospitalized
compartments. This is reasonable since ρα is also practically 0 indicating no
recovery for this states as seen in the data (not shown here).
Table 4 shows the basic reproduction number R0 values computed for our model
using (3) and the parameters listed in Table 7. The epidemic is expected to continue indefinitely if R0 > 1 as predicted for all states. This suggest that stricter
measures such as the use of masks in public places, social distancing, contact
tracing and even longer stay-at-home orders need to be enforced in order to
eradicate the epidemic. Fig. 5 shows plot of the infected (asymptomatic plus
symptomatic), recovered and deaths. We see that shape of most curves are similar except for Wisconsin and Tennessee where the infected population begin to
flatten over time. In particular, spikes of the curves in fig. 5 begin around late
March or early April 2020 and continues to rise.
Table 5 shows a computational comparison of the proposed model and the
integer-order counterpart using the sum squared errors (SSE) obtained for the

infected, recovered and dead populations. As seen in the table, the fractionalorder model shows superiority over the integer-order model in fitting the COVID19 pandemic. In fig. 6, we show the cumulative infected and hospitalized population. This plot also shows that while the infected population flatten over time
for states like California, Florida, Maryland, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin,
it increases for Georgia and Washington. If drastic measures are not taken, the
model suggest that many will be infected, at some point, before the end of 2021
in these states.
6. Conclusions
A fractional-order compartmental model is proposed to study the spread and
dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied the properties of the model
and discussed the parameters of the model in the context of sensitivity and
identifiability. We solve several inverse problems to estimate the fit parameters
of the model using data from John Hopkins University [59] for some selected
states in the US. The basic reproduction number R0 of the model was computed
and shows that the states considered have R0 values slightly greater than the
critical value of one. The model suggests that stricter or aggressive measures
need be enforced in order to slow the spread of the virus.

Appendix A. Proof of Theorem 3.1.
Proof. By applying [60, Theorem 3.1], we obtain the existence of the solutions.
To show the uniqueness and boundedness of solutions, it suffices to show, by
[60, Remark 3.2] and Rademacher’s theorem, that F = (f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 , f5 , f6 ) is
locally Lipschitz continuous where
f1 = bα

3 )IS ,

4 )H,
f6 = ρα H − bα
1 R.
Let X = (S, E, IA , IS , H, R), X̃ = (S̃, Ẽ, I˜A , I˜S , H̃, R̃) and || · || denote the L2
norm, then
||F (X) − F (X̃)|| ≤ ||f1 (X) − f1 (X̃)|| + ||f2 (X) − f2 (X̃)||
+ ||f3 (X) − f3 (X̃)|| + ||f4 (X) − f4 (X̃)||
+ ||f5 (X) − f5 (X̃)|| + ||f6 (X) − f6 (X̃)||

L3 = ησ + γ1 + µ2 , L4 = (1 − η)σ + γ2 + µ3 , L5 = γ1 + γ2 + ρ + µ4 and
L6 = ρα + bα
1 . Thus, F satisfies the local Lipschitz conditions with respect to X
which proves the uniqueness and boundedness of solution to (2). Next we show
the non-negativity of solutions. At first, we consider moving along the S-axis,
that is E(0) = IA (0) = IS (0) = H(0) = R(0) = 0 and 0 < S(0) = S0 ≤ N , then

whose solution is given as

α
α
α α
S(t) = S0 Eα,1 (−bα
1 t ) + b1 N t Eα,α+1 (−b1 t ) > 0

since bα
1 > 0 and t > 0. In a similar manner, moving along each of the other
respective axis (that is all initial conditions are zeros except for the axis being
considered), it is easy to show that
α
E(t) = Eα,1 (−(σ α + µα
1 )t ) E0 ≥ 0
α
IA (t) = Eα,1 (−(γ1α + µα
2 )t ) IA0 ≥ 0
α
IS (t) = Eα,1 (−(γ2α + µα
3 )t ) IS0 ≥ 0
α
H(t) = Eα,1 (−(ρα + µα
4 )t ) H0 ≥ 0
α
R(t) = Eα,1 (−bα
1 t ) R0 ≥ 0.

26

Therefore, all axis are non-negative invariant. Now, if the solution of the system
is positive in the E − IA − IS − H − R plane, then let S(t∗ ) = 0, E(t∗ ) > 0,
IA (t∗ ) > 0, IS (t∗ ) > 0, H(t∗ ) > 0 and R(t∗ ) > 0 for some t∗ such that S(t) <
S(t∗ ). But
α
α
0 Dt S |t=t∗ = b1 N > 0
in this plane. Using the mean value theorem for Caputo-fractional derivative
S(t) − S(t∗ ) =

1
Dα (τ )(t − t∗ )α
Γ(α) t

for some τ ∈ [t∗ , t), we see that S(t) > S(t∗ ). This contradicts our previous
statement. Similar arguments can be used for each of the remaining population
variables.

To show stability, we apply the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. Clearly A > 0 and
C > 0 if R0 < 1. It is easy to show that AB > C if K < 1 which completes the
proof.

Appendix D. Data Sets and Methods
Data for cumulative confirmed cases, recovered and deaths were obtained
from the Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) and Johns Hopkins University
(JHU) Center for Systems Science and Engineering which are made available to
the public on TDH’s website [52] and Github [59], respectively. The raw files
are converted into Panda data frames and stored for ease of access. For the files
obtained from [59], the data are sorted according to counties, so we aggregate
the cases for each of the recorded counties to obtain the total number of cases
in each day for the states. For the total number of population for each states,
we used the data obtained from the US Census Bureau [61].
All numerical simulations were done in python using our numerical scheme [62]
from which we obtain the solution of the proposed model at each time step as

The fitted parameters were obtained by using python’s scipy.optimize.minimize
routine with the limited memory BFGS method. One main benefit of the
routine is the use of bounds for fit parameters. This allows faster convergence of the algorithm and ensures obtaining meaningful fit parameters
of the model. The parameters are constrained to lie between 0 and 1 except for the transmission rates that are allowed to lie between 0.5 and 1.5
as suggested in [53, 54, 55, 56]. In some cases like Florida and Georgia
where the data shows little or no recovery of the infected population, we
constrain the fit parameter to lie within 0 and 1e-10. Fits were made
comparing the simulation results and the data obtained from [59] for the
infected, recovered and deaths.
