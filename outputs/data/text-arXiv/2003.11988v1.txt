Abstract
Background: Chest computed tomography (CT) is recognized as an important tool for COVID-19
severity assessment. As the number of affected patients increase rapidly, manual severity assessment
becomes a labor-intensive task, and may lead to delayed treatment.
Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe)
of COVID-19 based on chest CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting
assessment model.
Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age 45.3±16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female)
with confirmed COVID-19 are used, from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio
of the whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are calculated. A random forest
(RF) model is trained to assess the severity (non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features.
Importance of each quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of COVID-19, is
calculated from the RF model.
Results: Using three-fold cross validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true
positive rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of quantitative features shows that the volume and
its ratio (with respect to the whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related
to the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the right lung are more related
to the severity assessment than those of the left lung.
Conclusion: The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of
COVID-19 infection, and the performance is promising. Several quantitative features, which have the
potential to reflect the severity of COVID-19, were revealed.

Introduction
Since the end of year 2019, a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was detected and has rapidly
spread out worldwide. Recently, the world health organization (WHO) has declared that COVID-19
becomes a global pandemic [1]. Over thirty thousands of people around the world have been confirmed
as COVID-19 infection, and more people are suspected. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) is one of the standard diagnostic methods, but it faces the inherent disadvantage of false
negative positive due to many factors, e.g., quality, stability, reproducibility and possible insufficient viral
material in specimens [2]. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been identified as an important
complementary tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Comparing to RT-PCR test, chest CT is relatively
easy to operate and can provide fast diagnosis; moreover, chest CT has high sensitivity for screening
COVID-19 infection [3]. Therefore, chest CT has become an indispensable tool in the screening and
severity assessment of COVID-19 in China. However, since the explosively increased confirmed and
suspected cases of COVID-19, manually assessing the severity of COVID-19 based on chest CT images
becomes a labor-intensive task, potentially leading to the delay of patient isolation and treatment.
Although automatic severity assessment for COVID-19 using chest CT is highly desired, very few
studies focusing on this topic has been reported. Most of current studies on chest CT images are about the
findings of image characteristics related to COVID-19, e.g., the ground glass opacity (GGO) and
consolidation regions in chest CT images [4, 5]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has
worked on automatic severity assessment of COVID-19 using chest CT images.
In this paper, we build a random forest (RF) based model for COVID-19 severity assessment. The
input of the model is the quantitative features calculated from chest CT images, and the output is the
severity of COVID-19 (non-severe or severe). In order to reduce the redundant and unrelated quantitative
features, in the training stage, the importance of all quantitative features in the context of COVID-19
3

severity assessment is calculated, and a subset of quantitative features that are of great importance is
selected to train the RF model. The performance of the resulting RF model is found to be very promising.

Material and methods
This multi-center study was approved by Medical Ethical Committee (approved number: 2020002), which
waived the requirement for patients’ informed consent referring to the Council for International
Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) guideline.
Chest CT images
In total, chest CT images of 176 patients (age 45.3±16.5, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID19 (RT-PCR test positive) are included in this study. All chest CT images were captured in seven hospitals
with different types of CT scanners, including Philips (Ingenuity CT iDOSE4), Siemens (Somatom
perspective), GE (Bright speed S), Hitachi (ECLOS) and Anke (ANATOM 16HD). The scanning
parameters are as follows: 120 kVp, 100-200 mAs, pitch 0.75-1.5 and collimation 1-5 mm. All imaging
data were reconstructed by using a medium sharp reconstruction algorithm with a thickness of 1-5 mm.
The clinical condition of COVID-19
For each patient, the severity of COVID-19 is determined following the guideline of 2019-nCoV (trial
version 7) issued by the China National Health Commission, and the severity includes four types: mild,
common, severe, and critical [6]. However, the number of patients with mild and critical types are small
as compared to those with common and severe types. In order to avoid the imbalanced issue, we categorize
patients into two groups: non-severe group (mild and common) and severe group (severe and critical), and
then do two-type severity assessment (non-severe or severe), i.e., binary classification. It is worth noting
that the binary classification is reasonable in clinical practice, as patients with non-severe and severe types
are different in treatment regimen. Of these 176 patients, 121 are identified as non-severe, and 55 are
4

identified as severe. Fig. 1 shows examples of the chest CT images from 2 non-severe patients and 2
severe patients.
Quantitative features in chest CT images
In this study, a COVID-19 chest CT analysis tool (uAI-Discover-NCP) [7], which is developed by
Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co., Ltd., is used to calculate the quantitative features from the
chest CT images. This tool is based on deep learning, where a VB-net [7] is adopted to fulfill accurate
segmentation of lung as well as infection regions from chest CT images. It is evaluated on 300 subjects
with 0.916 Dice similarity with manual delineations. According to segmentation results, quantitative
features, which are potentially related to COVID-19, are calculated. Specifically, the lung is segmented
and divided into five lung lobes, i.e., superior/middle/inferior lobes of the right lung ( RBS|M|I ) and
superior/inferior lobes of the left lung (LBS|I), and 18 lung segments, where 10 segments in the right lung
(RS1−10 ) and 8 segments in the left lung (LS1−8 ). The infection volume (𝑰𝑽) and ratio (𝑰𝑹) of the whole
lung (WL), right/left lung (RL/LL), and each lobe/segment are calculated as quantitative features, as
defined below:

𝑰𝑽(𝑥 ) = 𝑽(𝑥infect ),

𝑰𝑽(𝑥)

IR(x)= 𝑽(𝑥) =

𝑽(𝑥infect )
𝑽(𝑥)

(1)

where 𝑽(. ) is the volume of input region, 𝑥 ∈ {WL, RL, LL, RBS|M|I , LBS|I , RS1−10 , LS1−8 } and 𝑥infect
is the infected regions in 𝑥. Moreover, regions within the HU ranges of −∞ to -750 (HU[−∞,−750] ), -750
to -300 (HU[−750,−300] ), -300 to 50 (HU[−300,50] ), and 50 to +∞ (HU[50,+∞] ) are also considered in our
study. These four HU ranges correspond to normal lung regions, ground glass opacity (GGO) regions,
consolidation regions, and regions of vessel calcification, respectively. Volumes and ratios of these four
regions are also calculated and adopted as quantitative features. It is worth noting that, the ratio of the
5

𝑽(𝑥)

region 𝑥 within each HU range is calculated by 𝑹(𝑥) = 𝑽(WL) (i.e., with respect to the volume of the
whole lung). These 60 quantitative features together with the volumes of the whole/right/left lung form
the final quantitative feature set (i.e., 63 quantitative features in total). A summary of these 63 quantitative
features is presented in Table 1.
Random forest based severity assessment
Random forest (RF) is a kind of ensemble learning method [8], where training samples for building each
decision tree [9] are randomly selected (bootstrap samples) [10], and the final result is obtained by
majority voting or averaging the prediction results from multiple decision trees. Since RF is robust to
noise [11] and relatively insensitive to small amount of training samples [12], it has been widely used for
classification and regression tasks in medical field [13-15]. In this study, the classification and regression
tree (CART) is adopted to build the RF model. The Gini index is used in CART to measure the split quality
at each node, which is defined as:
𝐶

𝐶

𝑮(𝑥) = ∑ 𝑷𝑐 (𝑥) ∑ 𝑷𝑐′ (𝑥 ) = 1 − ∑ 𝑷2𝑐 (𝑥)
𝑐=1

𝑐′≠𝑐

(2)

𝑐=1

where 𝑥 is the sample set at a node, 𝑷𝑐 (𝑥) is the probability of samples in 𝑥 belonging to class 𝑐, 𝐶 is
the number of all classes, and 𝐶 = 2 for binary classification. At each node, the CART chooses a feature,
which has the smallest Gini index of

|𝑥left |
|𝑥|

𝑮(|𝑥left ) +

|𝑥right |
|𝑥|

𝑮(|𝑥right ) of all features (|. | is the sample

size), to split the samples in x into two subgroups (i.e., the left and right child nodes containing samples
𝑥left and 𝑥right , respectively).
Considering the relatively imbalanced samples, i.e., the ratio between non-severe and severe samples
is 11:5, a weighted random forest (WRF) strategy [16] is applied. Specifically, instead of assigning equal
weights to training samples in traditional RF (i.e., setting sample weight as 1), the sample weights in WRF
6

are inversely proportional to the sample numbers of their classes, i.e., assigning large weights to samples
in minority classes. Fig. 2 provides the whole workflow of the RF based severity assessment for COVID19.

Results
Three-fold cross-validation is performed to evaluate the RF based severity assessment model. In each
case, the training samples are divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) samples. It is worth noting
that, the ratio between non-severe and severe samples in the training, validation, and testing samples is
relatively consistent with that in all 176 samples (i.e., around 11:5).
The RF model contains 500 decision trees. The input of the RF model includes 63 quantitative
features calculated from chest CT images, and the output is the severity of COVID-19 (i.e., non-severe or
severe). To explore the relations of 63 quantitative features to the severity of COVID-19, importance of
each quantitative feature is also calculated based on the RF model. The importance of each quantitative
feature (𝐹𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, … ,63) is related to the reduced Gini index in the RF model using 𝐹𝑖 , which reflects the
capacity of 𝐹𝑖 in discriminating non-severe and severe types. Specifically, the reduced Gini index (𝑮RD )
of 𝐹𝑖 is calculated by:
𝑮RD (𝐹𝑖 ) =

1
|node𝑖 |

𝑖
𝑖
𝑮(𝑥 𝑖 ) − 𝑮(𝑥left
) − 𝑮(𝑥right
)

∑

(3)

𝑥 𝑖 ∈node𝑖

where node𝑖 is the nodes in the RF models that use quantitative feature 𝐹𝑖 to split samples 𝑥 𝑖 in node𝑖
𝑖
𝑖
into 𝑥left
and 𝑥right
. Based on 𝑮RD (𝐹𝑖 ), the importance of 𝐹𝑖 can be defined as:

𝑰𝑷(𝐹𝑖 ) =

𝑮RD (𝐹𝑖 )
.
63
∑𝑖=1 𝑮RD (𝐹𝑖 )

(4)

According to the resulting importance of quantitative features, top 𝐾 quantitative features of the
great importance are selected and used to build the RF model. To get the proper hyper-parameter 𝐾, a
7

grid search strategy is adopted. Specifically, in the experiment, besides the RF model using 63 quantitative
features (i.e., K63), five more RF models with 𝐾 = 50, 40, 30, 20, 10 are built, respectively, and their
performance is evaluated and compared using validation samples. Details of the evaluation results of these
RF models and their corresponding receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, together with area
under ROC curve (AUC) values, are presented in Fig. 3.
It could be observed that the K30 RF model (i.e., 𝐾 = 30) has the best performance using the
validation samples. Therefore, the K30 RF model is chosen as the final severity assessment model and
applied to the testing samples. Specifically, the evaluation result of K30 RF model using the testing
samples are 0.933 (TPR), 0.745 (TNR) and 0.875 (Accuracy). The ROC curve of K30 RF model evaluated
with the testing samples is shown in Fig. 4, and the AUC of the ROC curve is 0.91.
Table 2 shows the top 30 quantitative features of the great importance to the severity. The volume
and ratio of the region within the HU range of [-700,-300], corresponding to the region of ground glass
opacity (GGO) in chest CT images, is at the top rank. An interesting finding is that quantitative features
calculated from right lung are relatively more important than those of left lung (Table 2).

Discussions
In this paper, a random forest (RF) based automatic severity assessment of COVID-19 model was
presented; and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work using machine learning method to
perform severity assessment of COVID-19. Sixty-three quantitative features, including infection
volume/ratio of the whole lung as well as the volumes of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, were
calculated from the chest CT images and used as input of the RF model. The output of the RF model is
the corresponding severity (non-severe or severe). In addition, the importance of 63 quantitative features
was also calculated from the RF model, and different number of quantitative features, which are of the top
importance, were further selected and used to train the RF model. The RF model using 30 quantitative
8

features achieved the best performance using the validation samples, and the evaluation results using the
testing samples are promising, i.e., TPR, TNR and Accuracy are 0.933, 0.745, and 0.875, respectively,
along with AUC of 0.91.
Among these 30 quantitative features, the volumes of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions (HU range
of -700 to -300) and their ratios (with respect to the whole lung volume) are the most important features
contributed to the severity of COVID-19. This is contrary to several previous studies, which reported that
consolidation regions were more like to be seen in patients in ICU (Intensive Care Unit) or later stage of
the disease [17]. However, in this study, we only included initial CT images, indicating that GGOs might
be the predominant findings than consolidation regions at baseline [18, 19]. In our cohort, the volumes
and ratios of GGO regions are indeed greater than those of consolidation regions with 𝑝 = 3.28 × 10−7
using pairwise t-test. Fig. 5 shows the ratios of GGO regions, i.e., HU range of [-700, -300], and
consolidation regions, i.e., HU range of [-300, 50], of 176 patients. Moreover, the infection volume and
ratio of the whole lung are also highly related to the severity of COVID-19; this finding further proved
the previous study [20]. Another interesting finding is that the quantitative features of the right lung lobes
were more relevant to the severity of COVID-19 than those of the left lung lobes. This may be explained
by specific anatomical structure of the trachea and bronchi (i.e., short and straight), and the virus might
easily infect this location. Please note that this finding is consistent with previous studies related to
COVID-19 pneumonia baseline [18] and H7N9 baseline [21].
The limitation of this study is that two types of the COVID-19 severity (non-severe and severe) were
used (i.e., with binary classification), instead of four types (i.e., mild, common, severe and critical),
because of limited numbers of patients with mild and critical types of COVID-19, respectively. In this
study, mild and common were regarded as non-severe, while severe and critical were combined as severe.

9

In the future, we will extend the severity types by collecting chest CT images from more patients through
multi-center collaborations.
