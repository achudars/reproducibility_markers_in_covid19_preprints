ABSTRACT

CCS CONCEPTS

Since the start of COVID-19, several relevant corpora from various
sources are presented in the literature that contain millions of
data points. While these corpora are valuable in supporting many
analyses on this specific pandemic, researchers require additional
benchmark corpora that contain other epidemics to facilitate crossepidemic pattern recognition and trend analysis tasks. During our
other efforts on COVID-19 related work, we discover very little
disease related corpora in the literature that are sizable and rich
enough to support such cross-epidemic analysis tasks. In this paper,
we present EPIC30M, a large-scale epidemic corpus that contains
30 millions micro-blog posts, i.e., tweets crawled from Twitter, from
year 2006 to 2020. EPIC30M contains a subset of 26.2 millions tweets
related to three general diseases, namely Ebola, Cholera and Swine
Flu, and another subset of 4.7 millions tweets of six global epidemic
outbreaks, including 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu, 2010 Haiti Cholera,
2012 Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), 2013 West African
Ebola, 2016 Yemen Cholera and 2018 Kivu Ebola. Furthermore, we
explore and discuss the properties of the corpus with statistics
of key terms and hashtags and trends analysis for each subset.
Finally, we demonstrate the value and impact that EPIC30M could
create through a discussion of multiple use cases of cross-epidemic
research topics that attract growing interest in recent years. These
use cases span multiple research areas, such as epidemiological
modeling, pattern recognition, natural language understanding and
economical modeling. 1

INTRODUCTION

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread around the globe
since the beginning of the year 2020, affecting around 200 countries
and everyone’s life. To date, the highly contagious disease has
caused over 6.6 million confirmed and suspected cases and 389
thousand deaths. In time of crisis caused by epidemics, we realize
the necessity of rigorous arrangements, quick responses, credible
and updated information during the premature phases of such
epidemics [40].
Social media platforms, such as Twitter, play an important role
in informing the latest epidemic status, via the announcements
of public policies in a timely manner. Facilitating the posting of
over half a billion tweets daily [31], Twitter emerges as a hub for
information exchange among individuals, companies, and governments, especially in time of epidemics where economies are placed
in a hibernation mode, and citizens are kept isolated at home. Such
platforms help tremendously to raise situational awareness and
provide actionable information [19].
Recently, numerous COVID-19 related corpora from various
sources are presented that contain millions of data points [11, 33].
While these corpora are valuable in supporting many analyses on
this specific pandemic, researchers require additional benchmark
corpora that contain other epidemics to facilitate cross-epidemic
pattern recognition and trend analysis tasks. During our other
efforts on COVID-19 related work, we discovered very little disease

related corpora in the literature that are sizable and rich enough to
support such cross-epidemic analysis tasks.
In this paper, we present EPIC30M, a large-scale epidemic corpus
that contains 11.8 millions micro-blog posts, i.e., tweets crawled
from Twitter, from year 2006 to 2020. EPIC30M contains a subset
of 3.9 millions tweets related to three general diseases, namely
Ebola, Cholera and Swine Flu, and another subset of 7.9 millions
tweets of six global epidemic outbreaks, including 2009 H1N1 Swine
Flu, 2010 Haiti Cholera, 2012 Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS), 2013 West African Ebola, 2016 Yemen Cholera, and 2018
Kivu Ebola.
We conduct several exploratory analyses to study the properties
of the corpus, such as word cloud visualization and time series trend
analysis. Several interesting findings are discovered through these
analyses. For instance, we find that a large quantity of topics are
related to specific locations; cross-epidemic topics, i.e. one that involves more than one epidemic-related hashtag, appear frequently
in several classes; and several hashtags related to non-epidemic
events, such as warfare, have relatively high ranks in the list. Furthermore, a time-series analysis also suggests that some of the
epidemics, i.e. 2010 Haiti Cholera and 2018 Kivu Ebola, show a surge
in tweets before the respective start dates of the outbreaks, which
signifies the importance of leveraging social media to conduct early
signal detection. We also observe that an epidemic outbreak not
only leads to rapid discussion of its own, but also triggers exchanges
about other diseases.
EPIC30M fills the gap in the literature where very little epidemicrelated corpora are either unavailable or not sizable enough to
support cross-epidemic analysis tasks. Through discussing various potential use cases, we anticipate that EPIC30M brings great
value and impact to various fast growing computer science communities, especially in natural language processing, data science
and computation social science. We also foresee that EPIC30M is
able to contribute partially to cross-disciplinary research topics,
such as economic modeling and humanity studies. While EPIC30M
includes tweets posted throughout the cause of each outbreak available in the corpora, we expect that EPIC30M may serve as a timeless
cross-epidemic benchmark.

RELATED WORK

In this section, we discuss the existing Twitter corpora for several
domains, such as COVID-19, disasters, and others. These corpora
attract a large quantity of interests and enable a large amount
of research works in their respective domains, which we believe
EPIC30M generalizes to a similar level of impact in the epidemic
domain.
Corpora of COVID-19. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic spread
across the globe and generated enormous economical and social
impact. Throughout the pandemic, numerous related corpora have
been released. For instance, Chen et al. [11] released a multi-lingual
corpus that consists of 50 million tweets that include tweet IDs and
their timestamps, across over 10 languages. Similarly, Banda et al.
[7] presented a large-scale COVID-19 chatter corpus that consists
of over 152M tweets with retweets and another version of 30 million
tweets without retweets.
English corpora of disasters. There are several disaster-related
corpora presented in the literature that are utilized for multiple
works. CrisisLex [38] consists of 60 thousand tweets that are related
to six natural disaster events, queried based on relevant keywords
and locations during the crisis periods. The tweets are labelled
as relavant or not-relevant through crowdsourcing. Olteanu et al.
[39] conducts a comprehensive study of tweets to analyze 26 crisis
events from 2012 to 2013. The paper analyzes about 25k tweets
based on crisis and content dimensions, which include hazard type
(natural or human-induced), temporal development (instantaneous
or progressive), and geographic speed (focalized or diffused). The
content dimensions are represented by several features such as
informativeness, types and sources. Imran et al. [20] releases a collection of over 52 million tweets, out of which 50 thousand come
with human-annotated tweets that are related to 19 natural crisis
events. The work also presents pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings
with a set of Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words and their normalizations, contributing in spreading situational awareness and increasing response time for humanitarian efforts during crisis. Phillips
[42] releases a set of 7 million tweets related to Hurricane Harvey.
Littman [28] publishes a corpus containing tweet IDs of over 35
million tweets related to Hurricane Irma and Harvey.
Non-English corpora of disasters. Numerous non-english crisis corpora are also found in the literature. For instance, Cresci et al.
[13] released a corpus of 5.6 thousand Italian tweets from 2009

to 2014 during four different disasters. The features include informativeness (damage or, no damage) and relevance (relevant or
not relevant). Similarly, Alharbi and Lee [2] compiled a set of 4
thousand Arabic tweets, manually labelled on the relatedness and
information-type for four high risk flood events in 2018. Alam et al.
[1] released a Twitter corpora composed of manually-annotated 16
thousand tweets and 18 thousand images collected during seven
natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and floods)
that occurred in 2017. The features of the datasets include Informativeness, Humanitarian categories, and Damage severity categories.
Other Twitter Corpora. Apart from crisis-related corpora, several Twitter datasets are used for analysis related to politics, news,
abusive behaviour and misinformation, Trolls, movie ratings, weather
forecasting, etc. For instance, Fraisier et al. [15] proposes a large and
complex dataset with over 22 thousand operative Twitter profiles
during the 2017 French presidential campaign with their corresponding tweets, tweet IDs, retweets, and mentions. The data was
annotated manually based on their political party affiliation, their
nature, and gender. We also find Twitter Corpora that are related
to other domains, such as politics [9, 50], cyberbullying [14], and
misinformation [17, 43, 52].

DATA COLLECTION

This section describes the data collection process for crawling
EPIC30M.
Epidemic Outbreaks. EPIC30M includes six epidemic outbreaks
in the 21st century, recorded by World Health Organization 3 and
happened after the founding of Twitter in 2006. These outbreaks
include the 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu, the 2010 Haiti Cholera, the 2012
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the 2014 West Africa
Ebola, the 2016 Yemen Cholera, and the 2018 Kivu Ebola, as listed in
Table 1. We intentionally exclude the recent COVID-19 pandemic
outbreak to avoid producing redundant work, as there are already
numerous COVID-19 datasets released by different parties with
multi-million data points.
Search Queries. For each outbreak, we initialize with a large
collection of keywords used as the search queries, with the hypothesis to retrieve most relevant tweets from Twitter. We use a
combination of keywords for each outbreak, as listed on table 1,
to fetch the related tweets. Two types of keywords used, namely
(a) general disease-related terms, such as ebola, cholera and swine
flu; and (b) specific outbreak-related terms with a combination of
location and disease, such as africa ebola and yemen cholera.

Woodstock ’18, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY

General Epidemics. Besides the outbreaks set, we extend EPIC30M
by including a subset of three general diseases, namely Cholera,
Ebola and Swine Flu. The tweets related to these diseases are crawled
since the respective first occurrence until 15t h May 2020. We expect
the general epidemic subset is able to act as additional benchmarks
and contribute substantially to various research topics, such as
pattern recognition and trend analysis.

4 DATA EXPLORATION
4.1 Hashtags Analysis
To gain a general overview of EPIC30M, we first conduct hashtags
analysis for each epidemic and plot them on a 3 by 3 grid, as shown
in Figure 1. The first row (Fig. 1a) represents three general diseases
whereas the second and third rows (Fig. 1b) represent the six outbreak classes in chronological order. Each word cloud contains the
top 100 hashtags in their respective class, where the sizes represent
their frequencies.
Through observation, we identify several interesting phenomena, such as: (1) Key terms provide semantic indication of the
crises, in addition to possible cross-epidemic indicators: such as
pandemic, epidemic, healthcare, vaccine, disease, sanitation, and
others; (2) location-related hashtags, such as #Yemen, #Haiti and
#SierraLeone, appear in all classes and occupy majority of the key
words, which we believe to be the highest concerned feature; (3)
several classes include hashtags of other diseases, i.e., #COVID19
in the 2016_Yemen_Cholera class and #Malaria in the Cholera class,
which implies that discussions on cross-epidemic matters are popular; and (4) some hashtags refer to non-epidemic related events,
such as #5YearsOfWarOnYemen and #earthquake appearing in the
2016_Yemen_Cholera and 2010_Haiti_Cholera sets respectively.

4.2

Time-series Trend Analysis

Subsequently, we conduct trend analysis with an attempt to identify time-variant patterns from the corpus. For the three general
classes (Fig. 2a), we plot each class into a line chart, where the
x-axis represents the time in yearly dates and the y-axis represents
the corresponding number of tweets. For the six outbreak classes
(Fig. 2b), the x-axis of each line chart uses the number of days offset
from the start date of the outbreak, whereas the y-axis represents
the number of tweets normalized to between 0 and 1.
Through the time-series line plots, we observe that some of
the epidemics, i.e. 2010 Haiti Cholera and 2018 Kivu Ebola, show
a surge in tweets before the respective official start dates of the
outbreaks, which signifies the importance of leveraging social media
to conduct early signal detection. We also observe that an epidemic
outbreak not only leads to rapid discussion of its own, but also
trigger exchanges of other diseases. Finally, the time-series analyses
also show clear dynamic properties or trends with exponential
increases (shocks or spikes) in tweet type and a temporal persistence
after an initial shock [16]. Other dynamic properties that may be of
interest include local cycles and trends. Such dynamic effects, when
paired with semantic content (such as healthcare related terms),
may provide potential indicators of an onset of a crisis.

POTENTIAL USE CASES

While Twitter has an enormous volume and frequency of information exchange, i.e. over half a billion tweets posted daily, such rich
data potentially exposes information on epidemic events through
substantial analysis. In this section, we demonstrate the value and
impact that EPIC30M could create by discussing on multiple use
cases of cross-epidemic research topics that attract growing interests in recent years. These use cases span multiple research areas,
such as epidemiological modeling, pattern recognition, natural language processing and economical modeling. We claim that EPIC30M
fills the gap in the literature where very little disease related corpora are sizable and rich enough to support such cross-epidemic
analysis tasks. EPIC30M supplies benchmarks of multiple epidemics
to facilitate a wide range of cross-epidemic research topics.
Epidemiological Modeling. Epidemiological modeling provides
various potential applications to understand the Twitter dynamics
during and post-outbreaks, such as compartmental modeling [3]
and misinformation detection [51]. To name a few, Jin et al. [21]
uses Twitter data to detect false rumors and a susceptible-exposedinfected-skeptic (SEIZ) model to group users in four compartments.
Skaza and Blais [49] use susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) epidemic models on Twitter’ hashtags to compute infectiousness of a
trending topic. In the recent event of COVID-19, these models are
repeatedly applied to predict discrete questions, such as Chen et al.
[11]’s proposal of using a time-dependent SIR model to estimate the
total number of infected persons and the outcomes, i.e., recovery
or death.
Trend Analysis and Pattern Recognition. Extensive prior
works leverage social media data to perform trend analysis and pattern recognition tasks. For instance, Kostkova et al. [23] study the
2009 swine-flu outbreak and demonstrates the potential of Twitter
to act as an early warning system up-to a period of two or three
weeks. Similarly, Joshi et al. [22] predict alerts of Western Africa
Ebola epidemic, three months earlier than the official announcement. While early detection and warning systems for crisis events
may reduce overall damage and negative impacts [31], EPIC30M
provides high volume and timely information that facilitate trend
analysis and pattern recognition tasks for epidemic events.
Sentiment and Opinion Mining. The observation of social
sentiments and public opinions plays an important part in benchmarking the effect of releasing public policy amendments or new
initiatives. Several prior works leverage sentimental analysis and
opinion mining to extract the contextual meaning of social media content. For instance, Beigi et al. [8] provides an overview of
the relationship among social media, disaster relief and situational
awareness in crisis time, and Neppalli et al. [36] performs locationbased sentimental analysis on tweets for Hurricane Sandy in 2012.
Topic Detection. Topic detection or modeling may enable authorities in anticipating a crisis and taking actions during the same.
The technique helps in recognizing hidden patterns, understanding
semantic and syntactic relations, annotating, analyzing, organizing, and summarizing the huge collections of textual information.
Considering the same, several researchers have implemented these
approaches on crises datasets to detect and categorize the potential
topics. Chen et al. [12] suggest two topic modeling prototypes to
ameliorate trends estimation by seizing the underlying states of a

user from a sequence of tweets and aggregating them in a geographical area. In [27] researchers perform optimized topic modeling using
community detection methods on three crises datasets [38, 39, 52]
to identify the discussion topics.
Natural Language Processing. Several works leverage Twitter
datasets to conduct Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. As

a challenging downstream task of NLP, Automatic Text Summarization techniques extract latent information from text documents
where the models generates a brief, precise, and coherent summary from lengthy documents. Text summarization is applicable
in various real-would activities during crisis, such as generating

Woodstock ’18, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY

news headlines, delivering compact instructions for rescue operations and identifying affected locations. Prior works demonstrate
such applications during crisis time. For instance, Rudra et al. [45]
and [44] propose two relevant methods that classify and summarize
tweets fragments to derive situational information. More recently,
Sharma et al. [46] proposes a system that produces highly accurate
summaries from the Twitter content during man-made disasters.
Several other works focus on NLP subtasks of social media, such as
information retrieval [18, 29] and text classification [30, 41].
Disease Classification. Applications of Machine Learning and
Deep Learning in the healthcare sector gather growing interests
in recent years. For instance, Krieck et al. [24] analyzes the relevance of Twitter content for disease surveillance and activities
tracking, which help alert health official regarding public health
threats. Lee et al. [26] conducts text mining on Twitter data and
deploys a real-time disease tracking system for flu and cancer using
spatial, temporal information. Ashok et al. [4] develops a disease
surveillance system to cluster and visualise disease-related tweets.
Crisis-time Economic Modeling. Estimating economical impact of crises, such as epidemic outbreaks, is a crucial task for policy
makers and business leaders to adjust operational strategies [32]
and make right decisions for their organizations in the time of crises.
Several research studies in such domain. For instance, Okuyama
[37] provides an overview and a critical analysis of the methodologies used for estimating the economic impact of disaster; Avelino
and Hewings [5] proposes the Generalized Dynamic Input-Output
framework (GDIO) to dynamically model higher-order economic
impacts of disruptive events. Such studies correlate disaster events
and economy impact, which rely on disaster-related data and financial market data, respectively. We believe that EPIC30M is able
to contribute to future economic modeling studies for epidemic
events.
Health Informatics. Compared to the cases above, a more general use case area is healthcare Informatics , i.e., âĂĲthe integration
of healthcare sciences, computer science, information science, and
cognitive science to assist in the management of healthcare informationâĂİ [6, 34, 48]. While social media and online sources are used
to connect with patients and provide reliable educational content
in health informatics, there is growing interest in using Twitter and
other feeds to study and understand indicators for health trends
or particular behaviors or diseases. For example, Nambisan et al.
[35] utilize Twitter content to study the behavior of depression.
EPIC30M contains behavioral information across various diseases
and how the populace behaves with the onset and persistence of
the diseases. Multiple disease cases will provide such research to
correlate behavioral information across instances.
News and Fake News. With the proliferation of news content
through internet and virtual media, there is a growing interest
in developing an understanding of the science of news and fake
news [25]. Data mining algorithms are advancing to study news
content [47]. EPIC30M contains real news content that grows over
time from social lay-person terminology to technical and professionally based information and opinion. It likewise includes fact-based
information as well as distorted or fake content. Through multiple
cases over time, the field will have a rich source to study news
content, especially when correlating with reliable news sources for
particular snapshots of time.

Liu et al.

All in all, we believe that EPIC30M provides a set of rich benchmarks and is able to facilitate extensions of the above-mentioned
works on a higher order, e.g., in cross-epidemic settings. As a result, the research findings are more robust and closer to real-world
scenarios.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

Conclusion. During our other efforts on COVID-19 related work,
we discovered very little disease related corpora in the literature
that are sizable and rich enough to support such cross-epidemic
analysis tasks. In this paper, we present EPIC30M, a large-scale epidemic corpus that contains 11.8 millions tweets from 2006 to 2020.
The corpus includes a subset of tweets related to three (3) general
diseases and another subset related to six (6) epidemic outbreaks.
We conduct exploratory analysis to study the properties of the
corpus and identify several phenomena, such as strong correlation
between epidemics and locations, frequent cross-epidemic topics,
and surge of discussion before occurrence of the outbreaks. Finally,
we discuss a wide range of use cases that EPIC30M can potentially
facilitate. We anticipate that EPIC30M brings substantial value and
impact to both fast growing computer science communities, such as
natural language processing, data science and computation social
science, and multi-disciplinary areas, such as economic modeling,
health informatics and the science of news and fake news.
Future work. For some epidemic outbreaks, such as 2009 H1N1
Swine Flu and 2014 West Africa Ebola, EPIC30M includes relevant
tweets posted throughout the respective duration of the epidemics.
We expect the data of these few classes could serve as strong and
timeless cross-epidemic and cross-disease benchmarks. On the other
hand, several epidemics, such as 2018 Kivu Ebola and 2016 Yemen
Cholera, are still ongoing. We intend to extend the corpus by actively
or periodically crawling tweets in addition to the current version.
Furthermore, we plan to further develop the corpus with additional
epidemic outbreak classes that happened more recently, such as
the 2019 multi-national Measles outbreaks in the DR Congo, New
Zealand, Philippines and Malaysia, the 2019 Dengue fever epidemic
in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, and the 2018 Kerala Nipah virus
outbreak. Lastly, we also intend to develop an active crawling web
service that automatically update EPIC30M, and migrate to cloudbased relational database services to ensure its availability and
accessibility.
The corpus is available at https://www.github.com/junhua/epic.
