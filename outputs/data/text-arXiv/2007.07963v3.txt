Abstract
Purpose – An important theme is how to maximize the cooperation of employees when
dealing with crisis measures taken by the company. Therefore, the purpose of this paper
is to find out what kind of employees cooperated with the company's measures in the
current corona (COVID-19) crisis, and what effect the cooperation had to these
employees/companies to get hints for preparing for the next crisis.
Design/methodology/approach – Pass analysis was carried out using awareness data
obtained from a questionnaire survey conducted on 2,973 employees of Japanese
companies in China.
Findings – The results showed that employees with higher social capital and resilience
were more supportive of the company's measures against corona and that employees who
were more supportive of corona measures were less likely to have turnover intention.
However, regarding fatigue and anxiety about corona felt by employees, it was shown
that it not only works to support cooperation in corona countermeasures but also enhances
the intention to leave.
Research limitations/implications – This study used self-report data from individual
respondents, which may have resulted in common method bias, although we confirmed
that the impact was not large. Future research might consider including supervisor-rated
scales to strengthen the study design and reduce common method bias.
Practical implications – It is important for employees to be aware of the crisis and to
fear it properly. But more than that, it should be possible for the company to help
employees stay resilient, build good relationships with them, and increase the social
capital to make them support crisis measurement of the company most effectively while
keeping their turnover intention low.
Originality/value – This research is one of the first papers to show how effective human
resource management daily is in crisis management, focusing on measures against corona.

Introduction
In the new coronavirus (COVID-19) peril, Japanese companies in China were required to
deal with employee hygiene and attendance management. Among these, what kind of
company was able to get employees to work on corona measures smoothly? Also, how
was such cooperation related to the employee's turnover intention, which is an important
issue in personnel measures? In this paper, we would like to consider this problem by
conducting an analysis using data obtained from a questionnaire survey recently
conducted on employees of Japanese companies in China.
The first possible factor that determines the cooperation of employees in dealing
with a company's crisis is how they have accepted their work and company. Employees
who take a positive attitude about work and the company daily may have been more
supportive of the company's measures against corona. Also, as a side effect, if the
measures of the organization are successful through cooperation, cohesion among
employees may have been strengthened and the willingness to leave may have declined.
In China, where a Confucian tradition has a strong influence, the relationship of
reciprocity (employees who feel the support of the organization to act in return for the
organization) is still common today. Previous studies have argued that it still has a
significant impact on the human resources policies of modern enterprises in China (e.g.,
Warner, 2010).
The next thing to consider is how responsive the employees were to the crisis.
Many previous studies have revealed that the crisis response capabilities of employees
play an important role in recovering from a crisis, using keywords such as resilience and
coping as a clue (e.g., Aldrich, 2012). However, most of them are studies that deal with
the ability to heal and recover the feelings that have been hurt by a crisis such as a natural
disaster. What impact does employee resilience or coping have on the company's
measurements against the crisis? In a continuous and difficult-to-see crisis such as this
coronavirus peril, there is a large part that cannot be overcome by individual tolerance
alone, so it is meant to clarify how it is connected to the organization's attitude to crisis
countermeasures.
The last thing to consider is how anxious employees were about the coronavirus
peril. The magnitude of anxiety will depend not only on the personality of the individual,
such as whether or not he/she is prone to anxiety but also on what kind of health condition
he/she was in at work. Employees who are well-managed in good physical and mental

2

health may not have had much anxiety during this crisis. On the other hand, employees
who are tired due to poor health management may have become more and more anxious
during this crisis and may have been more eager to seek corona measures.
Furthermore, if the employee's efforts to combat corona are short-term outcomes,
the long-term outcomes the organization should aim for in human resource management,
including lower employee turnover intentions, are also need to be discussed. By doing so
in the current research, we believe that it will give us a hint to take measures during a
crisis without sacrificing employee loyalty to the organization and, if possible, increasing
it further.

Theoretical framework
It is important to focus on resilience when considering how to respond to a crisis.
Resilience refers to the ability of people, society, and organizations to control damage
and increase sustainability in adversity (Serfilippi and Ramnath, 2018). To measure a
person’s/organization's resilience, it is necessary to look at how the person/organization
was exposed to adversity and how it responded (Sutcliffe and Vogus, 2003). Furthermore,
the evaluation of the response will change depending on whether it was a temporary
measure for overcoming adversity or a long-term effect. To that end, resilience-based
research needs to clearly define the adversity faced by the person/organization, the
response it has taken, and the short- and long-term outcomes (Rao and Greve, 2018). In
this paper, we will discuss corona erosion as the adversity faced by
employees/organizations, corona countermeasures represented by hygiene/ attendance
management as the measures taken by the organizations, employees' cooperation in
corona countermeasures as the short-term result, and the employees' intention to leave as
the long-term result. In other words, we consider not only how much employees were
able to be involved in the measures taken by the organization during the crisis, but also
how much they were able to lower their intention to leave the job as the result of a series
of measures against corona. This is because, if the tactical approach to a crisis can
influence employee loyalty to the organization, simply overcoming the immediate crisis
is unlikely to be a complete success. As a factor that influences these outcomes, we adopt
social capital, resilience, and anxiety about the corona for the reasons mentioned at the
beginning. Furthermore, we would like to briefly confirm the validity of the analytical
model by picking up the voices in the open-ended column provided in the survey form.

Determinants of cooperation intentions for corona countermeasures
So how can we get our members to help the organization deal with corona? If there are
differences in the attitudes of employees' cooperation between organizations, it can be
said in a nutshell that they are due to the accumulation of daily personnel measures. In
considering this problem, we would like to refer to social capital, a characteristic of social
organizations such as trust, norms, and networks that can improve social efficiency by
activating people's coordinated actions (Putnam et al., 1994). It should be recalled here
that many organizations routinely take various measures to increase the social capital of
their employees. This is because members are said to unite and exchange information to
achieve their goals in high social capital organizations (Leana and Van Buren, 1999). In
line with social exchange theory-based literature on employee-employer relationships
(Coyle-Shapiro and Shore, 2007; Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005), a previous study
confirmed that social capital can contribute to employees’ sense of obligation to pay back
the cooperative and collaborative working atmosphere (Parzefall and Kuppelwieser,
2012). In particular, concerning disasters such as the corona eruption, which was difficult
to predict in advance, it is thought that employees were required to have more
understanding and cooperation than what can be captured by written rules and manuals.
Therefore, it is considered that the presence or absence of social capital influenced the
size of cooperation for the measures against corona. From the above, the following
hypotheses are derived.
H1: Employees with higher social capital were more supportive of the organization's
measures against corona
Previous studies have shown that highly resilient employees can respond appropriately to
organizational problems (Avey et al., 2009) and tend to be more flexible in accepting and
cooperating with organizational changes (Shin et al., 2012; Wanberg and Banas, 2000).
Therefore, it is expected that employees with higher resilience were more supportive of
the organization's measures against corona, and the following hypothesis is derived.
H2: Employees with higher resilience were more supportive of the organization's
measures against corona
However, no matter how large the social capital and resilience are, if the corona isn't
something to worry about, the need for corona countermeasures will not be felt, and as a
result, cooperation with the organization will be limited. Anxiety can sometimes be a
motivation to take specific action by raising awareness of dangers to avoid and problems
to address (Strack et al., 2017). Therefore, if there is a great deal of anxiety about the

4

corona, it is considered that they are willing to cooperate with corona countermeasures,
and the following hypothesis is derived.
H3: Employees who were more concerned about corona were more supportive of the
organization's measures against corona
Determinants of turnover intention
Many researchers have pointed out that infectious diseases have historically caused
anxiety, suspicion, and panic, weakening trust in the policies of the organization, or
weakening the cohesion of the organization (Edelstein, 1988; Peckham, 2015; Picou et
al., 2004). Relatedly, Erikson (1994) argues that if the disaster is artificial, it weakens the
cohesion of the organization. Such a phenomenon may occur even when the members'
feelings leave the organization when the organization cannot effectively take measures
against the disaster and cannot prevent the damage that would otherwise be prevented.
Therefore, the following hypothesis is derived.
H4: Employees with greater anxiety were more likely to leave
But at the same time, Erikson (1994) also mentions the potential of natural disasters to
strengthen organizational cohesion. It can be assumed that if the members cooperate with
the disaster countermeasures of the organization and the response is successful, the trust
in the organization increases. These arguments may imply that disasters normally act by
damaging members' loyalty to the organization by causing anxiety, but if an organization
can make its members cooperate to the measures and respond well to disasters, it is not
impossible to increase their loyalty. Therefore, the following hypothesis is derived.
H5: Employees who were more supportive of the organization's measures against corona
were less likely to leave
Previous studies have shown that social capital has the effect of reducing turnover rates
(Shaw et al., 2005). Therefore, the following hypothesis is derived.
H6: Employees with higher social capital were less likely to leave
Relationship between social capital and resilience
Lengnick-Hall (2011) reviews a series of previous studies and argues that practicing HR
policies that create social capital and solidarity creates resilience for employees and
organizations. Therefore, the following hypothesis will be established.
H7: Employees with higher social capital had higher resilience

5

Relationship between resilience and anxiety
It is considered that those with high resilience were less anxious about corona because of
their confidence that they could cope well. Empirical findings indicate a negative
correlation between resilience and anxiety (Hjemdal et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2015).
Therefore, the following hypothesis is derived.
H8: Employees with higher resilience were less concerned about the corona
Relationship between fatigue and anxiety
In a workplace where health care is not routinely maintained, it is considered that
employees became tired and became more and more concerned that the company would
not take adequate measures against the corona. Correlation between fatigue and anxiety
has also been shown in previous studies (Jiang et al., 2003; Kokubun et al., 2018).
Therefore, the following hypothesis is derived.
H9: More tired employees were more concerned about the corona
Relationship between social capital and fatigue
The social capital variable was negatively correlated with fatigue in the previous studies
(Lim et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2006). Therefore, the following hypothesis is derived.
H10: Employees with greater fatigue had a lower social capital
Relationship between fatigue and intention to leave
Accumulation of fatigue will increase the desire for a less fatiguing workplace. Previous
studies have shown that fatigue and stress increase the willingness to leave the job (De
Croon et al., 2004; Lee and Jang, 2020). Therefore, the following hypothesis is derived.
H11: More tired Employees were more likely to leave
From the above, the 11 hypotheses shown in Fig. 1 will be tested in this paper.

Research method
The questionnaire consisted of attribute items such as gender and residential area, as well
as 40 question items based on the 5-point method. Of these, the social capital was created
by modifying and adding the organizational support items of Eisenberger et al. (1986) to
organizational commitment items of Kokubun (2018) which was created referring to
Mowday et al. (1982). In other words, we define social capital as the reciprocal state of
organizational support and employee commitment. Putnam et al. (1994) defined that
social capital consists of three elements: trust, reciprocity, and social networks. However,
this paper, which focuses on relationships within an organization, defines social capital
by focusing on trust (organizational support) and reciprocity (employee commitment).
Besides, fatigue was composed of the three items of Kokubun (2017; 2018) with
the addition of independently developed two items: "My work always keeps me from
feeling" and "I sometimes feel frustrated while working". This is because to see the
relationship between the anxiety about the corona and the mental state, we thought that
not only physical but also mental fatigue was more appropriate in the analytical model.
Regarding resilience, it was created by referring to the resilience scale of Saito and
Okayasu (2010) developed referring to Oshio et al. (2002), Wagnild et al. (1993), Friborg
et al. (2003), Connor et al. (2003), and disaster self-efficacy scale of Motoyoshi (2017)
developed referring to Nypaver (2011). Other corona-related items were independently
developed referring to various media and articles.

From February 15th to May 31st, 2020, this questionnaire, after being translated
into Chinese by the back-translation method, was distributed to more than 10,000 people
at 32 companies in the eastern and southern areas, and 6,673 people answered. However,
this analysis uses data from 2,973 people from 26 companies who answered all the
questions. Most of the target people are manufacturing employees (94.7%) and the rest
are design, finance, consulting, etc.

Analysis and results
All statistical analyses have been performed using IBM SPSS
Statistics/AMOS Version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). As a result of factor
analysis by varimax rotation, six factors as shown in Table 1 were extracted. The factor
names of social capital (composed of 14 items), resilience (composed of 10 items),
cooperation for corona measures (composed of 5 items), fatigue (composed of 5 items),
anxiety about corona (composed of 4 items), and turnover intention (composed of 2 items)
were assigned.
Before proceeding to the main analyses, Harman's single-factor
analysis was used to check if the variance in the data could be largely
attributed to a single factor, while the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was
used to test if the factors were related to the measures. First, the factor
analysis indicated that only 36.3 percent of the variance could be explained
by a single factor, which was <50 percent. Thus, it was established that the
data did not suffer from the common method variance (Chang et al., 2010).
Next, for CFA, the model fit was evaluated by examining the indices
recommended by Hu and Bentler (1999) and it was shown that the 6-factor
model shown in Table 1 fits better than the 1-factor model that added 6
variables (available upon request for more details).
Table 2 shows the results of descriptive statistics and correlation analysis
between variables. For each variable, 1 to 5 points are assigned to the individual response
items of the 5-scale method, and the average is calculated for easy comparison. The
highest score was 4.639 for cooperation for corona measures, followed by 4.332 for
resilience and 3.922 for social capital. On the contrary, the lowest was 1.812 for turnover
intention, followed by 2.508 for fatigue and 3.630 for anxiety about the corona. It can be
seen that the overall positive awareness is high and the negative awareness is low.
However, looking at the standard deviation, the former is 0.707 to 0.940, while the latter
is 1.121 to 1.169, indicating that the latter has more variation. Therefore, it should be
noted that the negative consciousness, especially the turnover intention, is not so high on

8

average, but the difference between employees is relatively large. Regarding age, 1 to 4
points were assigned to the options of "under 30", "30-39", "40-49", and "50 or older".
Similarly, concerning the length of service, 1 to 4 points were assigned to the options
"less than 1 year", "1 year to less than 3 years", "3 years to less than 5 years", and "5 years
or more".
Tables 3, 4, and 5 are descriptive statistics by gender, region, and position,
respectively. In terms of gender, males were significantly lower than females in social
capital, cooperation with corona measures, and anxiety about coronas and males were
significantly higher than females in intention to leave. By region, the eastern region was
significantly higher in terms of social capital, and significantly lower in fatigue, anxiety
about the corona, and turnover intention, than the southern region. By position, managers
were significantly higher than non-managers for cooperation with social capital,
resilience, and measures against corona and managers were significantly lower than nonmanagers for fatigue, anxiety about the corona, and turnover intention. Therefore, the
following analysis will be performed after incorporating gender, region, and position into
the variables.
Fig. 2 shows the result of the path analysis. Gender/regional/positional paths and
covariance between variables are omitted. However, in Table 5, the direct effect, the
indirect effect, and the total effect of the path coefficient are listed for all variables
including the variables omitted in Fig. 2. First, it was shown that higher social capital and
resilience would lead to greater cooperation in combating corona and supported H1 and
H2. H3 was also supported by showing that greater anxiety about corona increases
cooperation with corona countermeasures. Furthermore, H4, H5, and H6 were supported
as it was shown that the anxiety about corona heightened the intention to leave the job,
while the cooperation to the measures against corona and the social capital lowered the
intention to leave the job. Besides, the relationship between higher social capital and
higher resilience was shown, supporting H7. H9, H10, and H11 were also endorsed, as
fatigue was shown to increase anxiety about the corona, reduce social capital, and increase
willingness to leave. The only unexpected thing was the relationship between resilience
and anxiety about the corona. In other words, it was the opposite of the expectation that
an increase in resilience would increase anxiety about the corona, resulting in the rejection
of H8. By the way, Table 3 shows that although the resilience (0.580) is the largest in
terms of the overall effect on cooperation in countermeasures against corona, social
capital (0.507) and anxiety about corona (0.172) are also relatively large. Regarding the
overall effect on turnover intention, fatigue (0.410) was the largest, followed by social
capital (-0.229).

9

Thus, 10 out of 11 hypotheses were supported. Only the rejected H8 resulted in
the opposite of the assumption, that is, the higher the resilience, the greater the anxiety
about the corona.

Free answer analysis
The participants of the survey were asked to comment freely under the description "What
suggestions do you have for the current situation?" Regarding the measurements against
coronal bruise, there were: "Always open windows and improve ventilation" "Work to
prevent coronavirus" "Want to distribute mask regularly" "Share latest information"
"Coronavirus has had a huge impact on our employees, so we would like to ask our
employees to assist after the convergence''.
However, more common were the following comments that argued for the
importance of unity: "Let's work together to fight the virus, overcome the difficulties, and

15

do our best together!" "Continuing attention to the current situation of the coronavirus,
all employees will work together" "I hope that the company can overcome this difficulty"
"I will do my best to move forward together with the company" "I will do my best to
overcome the difficulties together" "Let's unite and survive this coronal disaster together."
Besides, there were noticeable comments for after the disaster: "Difficulty is
temporary, so I hope that the company will develop more and more" "The crisis brought
by Corona Erosion is also an opportunity. We can make better use of our strengths" "Both
coronavirus prevention and production activities must not be neglected" "Encourage the
production and recover the loss of corona damage" "The difficulty of corona damage is
temporary, so I hope that the company will recover quickly and production will be
normal!"
This fact is compatible with the model in this paper, in which a good relationship
between the company and employees daily leads to cooperation with employees for
measures against corona (a short-term result) and suppression of their intention to leave
the company (a long-term result).

Discussion
First, it was revealed that employees with higher social capital are more supportive of
corona countermeasures. From this, it can be said that it is a company that has a good
relationship with employees regularly that can get the cooperation of employees in a crisis.
Next, it became clear that employees with higher resilience were more supportive of
corona countermeasures. It can be interpreted that the high resilience allowed him to take
the current situation calmly, and to take positive action while cooperating with the
company's measures against corona. Besides, it was revealed that employees who are
more concerned about corona are more supportive of corona countermeasures. That is,
the greater the anxiety, the stronger the desire to seek countermeasures.
We expected a negative correlation between resilience and anxiety about the
corona. It was because he believed that with resilience, he would be able to control anxiety
without being upset during a crisis. However, the results were reversed, and a positive
correlation was found between the two. How can we interpret the unexpected positive
relationship between resilience and anxiety about corona? Most of the previous studies
have shown that resilience is effective in recovering from psychological shocks such as
past disasters. On the other hand, the coronal disaster this time was an ongoing crisis at
the time of the questionnaire. In this case, it would be more unusual to not be anxious
about the corona, and it could be interpreted that those with resilience were more sensitive
to the risk of corona and felt more anxious. Previous studies have also pointed out that

16

people with higher resilience can recognize their effects more accurately in adversity and
deal with them appropriately (Luthans et al., 2008; Youssef and Luthans, 2007).
However, anxiety about the corona is troublesome because it not only leads to
cooperation in countermeasures against corona but also has the effect of increasing the
intention to leave the job. Also, it has been clarified that the more tired the person is, the
greater the anxiety about the corona, and indirectly the supportiveness of corona
countermeasures. Regarding the former, it was shown in the attentional control theory
(ACT; Eysenck et al., 2007) that anxious persons tend to overlook the information that is
truly necessary to turn away from the information that causes anxiety. In other words,
they can't calmly accept that the organization's countermeasures against coronas can calm
their anxiety about coronas, and they are likely to cause thoughtless actions such as having
to get out of the organization as soon as possible. On the other hand, in the latter case, in
a company where employees' usual consideration for health is low, the employees who
accumulated fatigue may have become more anxious due to coronal bruise, feeling a
sense of crisis that further unhealthy conditions were unbearable. Therefore, they may
have shown a supportive attitude toward the company's measures against corona. In
previous studies, workplace fatigue was caused by physical factors such as workload,
psychological factors such as work regularity and human relationships, or environmental
factors such as air conditioning, sound, and lighting (Sadeghniiat-Haghighi and Yazdi,
2015). Neuroscience studies have also shown that fatigue correlates with brain health and
anxiety (Kokubun et al., 2018). According to the results of this article, both a company
with high social capital, a company with high employee resilience, and a company where
employees feel tired or anxious were able to have employees cooperate with the
company's measures against corona. Therefore, judging from the appearance, most of the
companies responded well to the crisis, as are shown by the high numbers in Table 2, and
it was probably difficult to notice the mechanism that occurred under the surface.
However, even for employees who seemed to be cooperative with the company from the
appearance, it is considered that there will be a large difference in intention to leave the
job when the corona damage is over and the post-corona stage is reached. Indeed, the
results in this paper show that the employees who cooperated with the company's
countermeasures against corona supported by good relationships with their jobs and
companies were less willing to leave. It can be said that such a company is expected to
further develop with corona on its side as if turning a pinch into an opportunity, as
expressed in the concrete voices of employees.
On the other hand, it seems that those who supported the corona countermeasures,
supported by their resilience, also tended to lower their intention to leave. This could be

17

interpreted as confirming that their resilience and the crisis response of the company are
in the same direction and increased confidence in continuing to work at the current
company. At the same time, however, it should be noted that people with high resilience
tended to indirectly lower their intention to leave the job due to heightened consciousness
or anxiety about the corona. As shown in Table 5, this indirect effect (-0.036) is not a
large value at all, but in an organization where employees do not have a favorable
impression on the work or company and it is not possible to expect a decrease in intention
to leave due to this direct or indirect path, it may be something that cannot be ignored.
Besides, it should be noted that people who have accumulated fatigue due to poor health
management tended to increase anxiety about the corona and cooperative attitude in
countermeasures against corona, and at the same time, increased the willingness to leave
the job. Therefore, if anxious, employees will cooperate with the company's measures.
However, their feelings will rapidly cool off after the crisis and they will leave the
company, suggesting risks of using anxiety as a motivator.

Implication
This paper analyzed psychological data obtained from a questionnaire survey conducted
on Chinese employees working for Japanese companies in China and found how
employees' feelings of work/company, resilience, and even anxiety/fatigue would affect
their cooperation to companies’ measures against the corona and intention to leave the
job. The results in this paper show that it is possible to encourage employees to cooperate
with the company's measures against corona even by fueling the anxiety of corona. At the
same time, however, it is also indicated that after the crisis is over, employees will face
the problem of increasing intention to leave. By creating a work environment that allows
employees to build good relationships with their jobs and companies, and by increasing
their resilience, not only can they successfully implement crisis countermeasures, the
employee's intention to leave the job can be lowered. It is important to prepare for a crisis
by working to build a relationship of trust with employees and improve their resilience
by this fall when there is concern about the second corona wave.

Conclusion
An important theme is how to maximize the cooperation of employees when dealing with
crisis measures taken by the company. Therefore, to find out what kind of employees
have cooperated with the company's measures in the current corona (COVID-19) crisis,
and what effect the cooperation has had to these employees/companies to get hints for
preparing for the next crisis, the pass analysis was carried out using awareness data

18

obtained from a questionnaire survey conducted on 2,973 employees of Japanese
companies in China. The results showed that employees with higher social capital and
resilience were more supportive of the company's measures against corona and that
employees who were more supportive of corona measures were less likely to leave their
jobs. However, regarding fatigue and anxiety about the corona felt by employees, it was
shown that it not only works to support cooperation in corona countermeasures but also
enhances the turnover intention. This means that just by raising the anxiety of employees,
even if a company achieves the short-term goal of having them cooperate with the
company's countermeasures against corona, it may not reach the longer-term goal by
making them increase their intention to leave. It is important for employees to be aware
of the crisis and to fear it properly. But more than that, it should be possible for the
company to help employees stay resilient, build good relationships with them, and
increase their social capital to make them support crisis measurement of the company
most effectively while keeping their turnover intention low.
