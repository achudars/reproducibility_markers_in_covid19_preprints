ABSTRACT
Scientific literature tends to grow as a function of funding and
interest in a given field. Mining such literature can reveal trends that
may not be immediately apparent. The CORD-19 corpus represents
a growing corpus of scientific literature associated with COVID-19.
We examined the intersection of a set of candidate therapeutics
identified in a drug-repurposing study with temporal instances of
the CORD-19 corpus to determine if it was possible to find and
measure changes associated with them over time. We propose that
the techniques we used could form the basis of a tool to pre-screen
new candidate therapeutics early in the research process.

INTRODUCTION

Diachronic word analysis is Natural Language Processing (NLP)
technique for characterizing the evolution of words over time. Often
used for historical linguistic studies, it can also be applied to scientific literature [Tshitoyan et al. 2019] and can reveal early evidence
of scientific discoveries before they become widely known.
Drug-repurposing studies aim to identify existing drugs that
might be useful in treating other diseases. The availability of large
amounts of data about drugs and infectious agents such as viruses
has enabled such studies to be performed in-silico. In early 2020, a
number of repurposing studies were undertaken to identify potential treatments for COVID-19.
The CORD-19 corpus [Wang et al. 2020] was established in
March 2020 as a repository for research related to SARS-COV-2 and
other coronaviruses. It aggregates content from PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and other sources, and it is updated with new publications on a regular basis. Figure 1 illustrates the growth of CORD-19
through mid-2020.

Figure 1: Weekly growth of the CORD-19 corpus
Using CORD-19, we conducted a diachronic survey of candidate therapeutics identified in one of the more exhaustive drug
re-purposing studies conducted to date for COVID-19, undertaken
in February 2020 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This study,
detailed in [Smith and Smith 2020], analyzed drugs in the SWEETLEAD database for potential antiviral properties. The study produced a dataset identifying over 9,000 existing approved drugs and
supplements as potential candidate therapeutics for COVID-19.
Most importantly for our purposes, this dataset included commonly
used drug or supplement names for each candidate.
Our survey considered the following questions:
• How many candidate therapeutics appear in CORD-19?
• Do references to the candidates change over time?

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Using temporal snapshots of CORD-19 spanning March 13 to June
30, we computed frequency and semantic representations for each
candidate therapeutic found in the corpus. For each temporal instance, we computed TF/IDF (Term Frequency/Inverse Document
Frequency) score for each candidate, a common metric to evaluate
the relative importance of terms in a corpus.

James Powell and Kari Sentz

To perform semantic analysis, we first computed diachronic
word embeddings for each temporal instance of the corpus. These
embeddings were aligned with one another to ensure that terms
from each temporal instance were comparable. The technique we
used is based on TWEC [3]. It uses a negative sampling optimization of softmax to maximize the probability that a set of words
surrounding word 𝑤𝑘 are representative of its context in time (𝐶 𝑡 ),
when multiplied by the mean of atemporal word embedding vectors
from 𝑢 (the compass) for the same set of context words around 𝑤𝑘 .
max log 𝑃 (𝑤𝑘 |𝛾 (𝑤𝑘 )) = 𝜎 (𝑢®𝑘 · 𝑐® 𝛾𝑡 (𝑤 ) )
𝑘
C𝑡
Since the TWEC embedding model did not account for phrases,
we incoporated an additional step to indentify them. Phrases (including drug names) were then specially encoded to allow them
to be treated like words. Figure 2 shows TF/IDF verses the mean
embedding distance to the compass for candidate therapeutics.
Because diachronic embedding instances were aligned with one
another, we were able to isolate a given candidate and visualize its
semantic trajectory over time (Figure 3). As the trajectory is based
on nearest neighbors at a given time, subtle changes in semantic
associations become apparent [Stewart et al. 2017].

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

We detected 14% (1267) of the candidate therapeutics in CORD-19
at 3/13, increasing to 26% (2361) by 6/30. For candidates detected in
multiple adjacent temporal instances of the corpus, we were able
measure their changes over time. We found that many candidates
exhibited increases in frequency, and stable or strengthening semantic associations. However, given the nature of this corpus, we
suspected some would exhibit other kinds of change over time.
We found that some candidate therapeutics exhibited different
patterns of semantic associations. Using heatmap visualizations as
described in [Xu and Crestani 2017], we can illustrate two additional recurring patterns of behavior. Some candidates exhibited
weakening semantic associations over time (Figure 4), while others
exhibited an abrupt persistent shift to a different pattern (Figure
5). Additionally, we found that these changes were not strongly
correlated with changes to a target’s frequency scores.

CONCLUSION

Our diachronic survey of candidate therapeutics for COVID-19
in the CORD-19 corpus found that some exhibited weakening or
abrupt changes of semantic associations. We speculate that this
could be related to the publication of new research that positively
or negatively affected consideration of a candidate therapeutic as
a treatment for COVID-19. Future work will investigate how to
detect and quantify these patterns, and to determine if there are
any correlations between a target’s rank and magnitude of change.
