ABSTRACT
Crises like COVID-19 can create a massive unmet demand for rare blood oxygenation membrane
machines for impaired lungs: Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machines.
Meanwhile, Hemodialysis (HD) machines, which use membranes to supplement failing kidneys,
are extremely common and widespread, with orders of magnitude more available than for ECMO
machines[1]. This short study examines whether the membranes for HD can be modified for use
in blood oxygenation (ECMO). To do so, it considers mass transfer at the micro-scale level, and
calculations for the macro-scale level such as blood pumping rates and O2 supply pressure. Overall,
while this conversion may technically be possible, poor gas transport likely requires multiple HD
membranes for one patient.
INTRODUCTION
Background on HD and ECMO
HD and ECMO machines both operate by removing large volumes of blood from the body and
passing them through membranes that rely on diffusion to transfer desirable or undesirable solutes.
HD machines focus on adding and removing compounds to assist with kidney failure, including
removing salts and small organic compounds like urea. Meanwhile, ECMO uses membranes to
replace O2 and help remove CO2.
Conversion approach requirements for HD for ECMO
Custom HD machines made for blood oxygenation[2] have been successfully demonstrated in the
past; the question is whether existing HD machines can be converted readily. The blood flow paths
of the two machines are similar, although flow rates and pipe diameters are smaller in HD: this
may require multiple machines. Catheter insertion points for ECMO are chosen to provide O2
where it is needed; the same placement would be necessary for a HD to ECMO conversion. The
dialysate side of the HD membrane presents numerous problems that limit the use of a liquid
dialysate. While it is possible to use an oxygenated dialysate for ECMO, it would need a separate
oxygenation chamber along with high pressure O2 supply. On the contrary, directly connecting a
O2 supply to the dialyzer ports allows for a far simpler arrangement that requires a lower O2 supply
pressure. Therefore, it was assumed that a pressurized O2 gas would be far more viable, although
it presents its own concerns like bypassing the machine warning and shut-down systems triggered
by no flow through the dialysate pump. Such pressurized O2 tanks are common in hospitals. Simply
1

described, such a conversion would resemble the invasive setup of venovenous ECMO (VVECMO), with blood connected to HD machine(s) that house the membranes, pump and controls,
and the dialysate side connected to a high pressure O2 tank.

Figure 1. Schematic of HD machines converted to operate as a VV-ECMO machine
The number of HD machines required to be connected in parallel for the conversion depends on the
maximum flow rate through the blood pump. With a flow rate of 1.63 l min-1 through the blood pump, an
array of at least three HD machines is needed for the conversion. The number of membrane modules
required depends on the blood flow rate through them. While the blood circuit is the same as in a
conventional dialysis machine, the dialyzer circuit is modified to operate with O2 gas from a compressed
cylinder or a medical gas supply line. Gas exchange occurs inside the dialyzer as deoxygenated blood gets
oxygenated while rejecting CO2 to the gas stream due to partial pressure differences of O2 and CO2 across
a hollow fiber. Modified human body graphic from http://www.learnecmo.com/vv‐ecmo

Concerns
There are numerous concerns and risks to address for attempting to modify HD machines as
ECMO machines.
 Reliability: putting a system together with multiple machines and membranes, calculated here
as 3 HD machines and 12 membranes modules
 Each patient takes up at least 3 dialysis machines
 High O2 supply pressure may lead to bubble induction in blood
 Pumps in parallel may lead to flow instabilities
 Peristaltic blood pumps in HD machines may have a maximum flow rate less than 1.6 l min-1
 Modifications to dialysis machines may be difficult to make
 Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) systems might be needed as these systems will
be used for long periods of time as compared to typical dialysis machines that are used for a
few hours

METHODOLOGY
The approach analyzes blood flow rates for O2 supply and performs simple transport calculations
to examine whether sufficient gas exchange can be provided. The concentrations of O2 present are
described in partial pressures. Representative values of HD membrane properties were obtained.
A large number of commercially available synthetic HD membranes today are made of
polysulfone[3] which is inherently hydrophobic. Hydrophilicity is imparted in the membrane
3

material by adding polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for reasons stated in [4]. Each membrane module
consists of tens of thousands of hollow fibers through which blood flows while the dialysate flows
over the fibers[4]. The two flows are usually counter-current, with radial concentration gradients
driving mass transfer of various necessary and waste solutes. This arrangement differs from
ECMO in which blood flows over the hollow fibers which carry oxygen[5]. We adhere to the
former arrangement with O2 flowing on the dialysate side to keep the number of necessary
modifications at a minimum.
The membrane dimensions used in the calculations are listed in Table 1. For properties that have
been reported with a range, average values were used. The value for membrane area was chosen
from the largest available membrane from Fresenius Medical Care to assess a system with least
number of membrane modules.

The transport of gases between the blood and the oxygen streams, across the membrane, is
essentially a diffusion problem driven by concentration gradients. Since O2 and CO2 are carried by
the blood as species bound to hemoglobin, we need to the convert the concentration gradients to
partial pressure gradients in order to be able to use the oxygen dissociation curve (ODC). The ODC
is a non-linear relationship between the volume fraction of O2 in blood and its partial pressure.
Table 2 lists the physiological parameters used for calculating the required O2 transport, indicating
the operating points of the ODC curve. The values used are representative of a healthy adult and
are the target values that need to be achieved through ECMO in a patient.

In order to solve for the rate of diffusion of O2, the diffusion coefficient or diffusivity of O2 in the
membrane material needs to be calculated. Given the partly hydrophilic nature of the membrane
material, we assume that the pores in the hollow fibers are mostly filled with plasma. The
diffusivity of O2 in pore confined plasma, however, would be lower than its bulk value,
𝐷 ,
. Given the porosity 𝜀 and the tortuousness of the transport path 𝜏 in a polymer
material, an effective diffusivity can be calculated as
,

[9]

The effective diffusivity can then be multiplied with the solubility of O2 in plasma 𝛼 to obtain
Krogh’s diffusivity given as

[10]

This along with the partial pressures of O2 allows us to use the same functional forms of the
diffusion equations to calculate O2 transport across the membrane. Reported and calculated values
of the diffusion parameters are listed in Table 3.

Transport calculations
The transport calculations must consider the micro-scale, describing diffusion through membranes
into the blood, and the macro-scale, describing changing O2 levels with length. Relative diffusion
in the different channels must be compared to neglect those that are an order of magnitude smaller.
On the micro-scale, O2 permeation can be calculated by assuming a negligible gas side resistance
and ignoring the blood side resistance owing to a high blood flow rate[13]. With mass transfer
being dominated by the membrane resistance, the overall mass transfer coefficient for a single
hollow fiber can be written as
𝑘

(5)

On the macro-scale, the variation of gas concentration with length along the membranes resembles
heat transfer in a shell and tube heat exchanger with phase change on the shell side, so a logarithmic
mean pressure difference is calculated as

(6)

The partial pressure of O2 on the gas side and is assumed to be constant along the length of a
hollow fiber. This appears to be a reasonable assumption provided the rate of O2 transport across
the membrane is small as compared to the bulk O2 flow rate on the gas side.
The net rate of blood oxygenation in one membrane module with 𝑁 fibers can then be written as

CONCLUSION
The limiting factor in the above arrangement is the maximum flow rate through the HD blood
pump, which in turn dictates the number of dialysis machines required to be put in parallel (3 here).
If the maximum blood pump flow rate is lower than 1.63 l min-1, we will need another dialysis
machine and so on. Another major concern would be to reprogram a hard-coded HD console that
might be not function as desired in the absence of the dialysate loop. Overall, there a significant
challenges in gas exchange in this conversion, but these likely can be overcome with engineering
to use multiple membranes per patient, modified flow and catheters, and the inclusion of high
pressure O2.
