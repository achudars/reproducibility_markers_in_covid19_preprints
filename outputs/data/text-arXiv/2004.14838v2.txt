Abstract.
The aim of the paper is to describe two models of Covid-19 infection dynamics. For this purpose a special class of branching processes with two types of
individuals is considered. These models are intended to use only the observed
daily statistics to estimate the main parameter of the infection and to give a
prediction of the mean value of the non-observed population of the infected individuals. Similar problems are considered also in the case when the processes
admit an immigration component. This is a serious advantage in comparison
with other more complicated models where the officially reported data are not
sufficient for estimation of the model parameters. In this way the specific development of the Covid-19 epidemics is considered also for all countries as it
is given in the specially created site http://ir-statistics.net/covid-19 where the
obtained results are updated daily.

1. Introduction.
The theory of branching processes is a powerful tool for investigation the
population dynamics where the members can reproduce new members following some stochastic laws. The objects may be of different types and nature.
Branching processes have serious applications in physics, chemistry, biology
and medicine, demography, epidemiology, economics, computer science an so
on. Basic models and analytical results are presented in some books and a lot
of papers. We would like to point out the monographs [1 − 8] among the others.
Some applications of branching processes in biology and medicine are presented
in [5], [9] and [10]. For statistical inference of branching processes one can
consider [11] and [12]. Some specific estimation problems are given in [13], [14]
and [15].
The aim of the present paper is to model and to estimate the development
of the Covid-19 infection in the population. For this purpose a special class of
branching processes with two types of infected individuals is constructed and
considered day by day. In fact they are ”infected undiagnosed” vs ” infected
diagnosed” following the terminology of P. Jagers (personal communication).
It is proposed also a generalization of this situation assuming an immigration
component. In this way we are able to use the observed data for the Covid19 daily registered infected individuals and to estimate the main parameter of
1

infection. In fact this parameter m represents the mean value of the infected
individuals by one individual per day. Using the observed statistics some methods for estimation are proposed and corresponding graphics are presented. Two
models with and without immigration are compared. In this way we are able to
give a prediction of the possible development of the mean value of the infected
individuals.
Notice that both type processes with or without immigration have an exponential growth in the supercritical case m > 1 but in the critical case m = 1
and in the subcritical case m < 1 the asymptotic behaviour is essentially different. In the critical case the mean value of the process with immigration grows
linearly while for the process without immigration the mean value is constant.
In the subcritical case the mean value of the immigration process converges to a
positive constant but for the process without immigration the mean value goes
to zero. The estimation of the immigration mean a is a serious problem because
this parameter cannot be estimated by the observed data and one needs additional information. Hence the processes with immigration need more careful
investigation.
As it is given in the paper the proposed estimators can be applied also in
the case when the processes are inhomogeneous in time. The behaviour of the
estimators shows that the observed processes are able to change the criticality
during the development of the epidemics. The estimated values for the main
epidemical parameter m vary greater than 1, equal (or very closed) to 1 and
even less than 1. Moreover it seems that the real epidemic process develops
like a mixture of both type of the models with and without immigration. In
this case four stages of epidemic development are available: exponential growth
(m > 1), linear growth (m = 1 and an immigration component), non-increasing
and almost stable population (due to m = 1 or m < 1 with an immigration component), convergence to zero (extinction of the epidemics due to m < 1 without
immigration). It is obvious that the restriction of the immigration component is
very important to the limitation of the epidemic process. It seems that in some
countries exist some regions which can be considered as immigration sources for
the other regions and in general for the whole country. The abroad immigration
plays also an important role.
The paper continues the investigations started in [16] where some results
for the model without immigration were presented only for Bulgaria, Italy and
globally.
In the present paper as an illustration of the models with and without immigration the obtained results are presented for several countries: USA, Italy,
France, Germany, Spain and Bulgaria. Additional information, reports and
plots, related to this research for all countries all over the world can be found
on the site http://ir-statistics.net/covid-19. The data used for the estimation
of the parameters of the model are taken from European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control [21], similar to the data provided by World Health Organization [20]. Since these databases are updated daily, the proposed here
model is applied regularly on each new data set. Using these results one can
compare the infection rate on different countries and regions on the basis of es2

timated growth rate. For example, on Table 3, the 10 countries with lowest and
highest growth rate are shown. Even in the cases where the infection growth is
less than 1, the confidence interval goes above 1, which states that there is a
possibility for increasing of the infection growth in the future.
The theoretical model based on two type branching process is described in
detail in Section 2. The p.g.f.’s and the mathematical expectations are obtained.
Regardless of its simplicity the model has a great advantage using only the observed official data for the lab-confirmed cases. The two-type branching process
assuming an additional immigration component is considered in Section 3. The
estimation problems are presented in Section 4. Some conclusive remarks are
given in Section 5.
Finally the estimation of the mean parameter of infection can be considered as a fast test to estimate the rate of Covid-19 epidemic in a country or
a region. It can be used also as a first stage of a construction to some more
complicated epidemiological models where it is not possible to estimate directly
this parameter. Obviously the solution of this problem requires the collaboration of specialists in various fields as epidemiology, mathematics, medicine,
microbiology, molecular biology and informatics among others.
2 Two-type branching process as model of Covid-19 population
dynamics.
Assume that the epidemic process of infection begins with some finite number of immigrants and then the process of immigration is isolated under the
quarantine.
To describe this situation we can consider a two type branching process
{Z1 (n), Z2 (n)} where type T1 are infected (but still healthy) individuals who
don’t know that they are Covid-19 infected and type T2 of discovered with
Covid-19 virus individuals (and this is the data we use). Every individual of
type T1 (infected) produces per day a random number of new individuals of
type T1 (infected) or only one individual of type T2 (more precisely, in this case
the individual type T1 is transformed into an individual type T2 ). Note that T2
is a final type, i.e. the individuals of this type don’t take part in the further
evolution of the process because they are isolated under the quarantine.
(1) (1)
Let ξ1 = (ξ1 , ξ2 ) be the offspring vector of type T1 . Then the offspring
joint probability generating function (p.g.f.) of type T1 can be defined as follows:

h1 (s1 , s2 ) = E(s11 s22 ) = p0 +

pj sj1 + qs2 , | s1 | ≤ 1, |s2 | ≤ 1,

Pk
where q = 1 − j=0 pj , h1 (1, 1) = 1.
Obviously h2 (s1 , s2 ) ≡ 1 because the type T2 has (0, 0) offspring.
Note that p0 is the probability that type T1 goes out of the reproduction
process (the individual becomes healthy or goes out of the country, i.e. emigrates), pj is the probability to produce new j infected individuals of type T1
and q is the probability that the individual type T1 is confirmed ill (or dead).
In other words, q = P{T1 → T2 }, i.e. with probability q an individual of type
T1 is transformed into an individual of type T2 . Then from (1) we can obtain

where the vectors {(ξ1 (n; j), ξ2 (n; j)} are independent and identically dis(1) (1)
tributed (iid) as (ξ1 , ξ2 ).
The recurrent formula (4) defines two-type branching process {(Z1 (n), Z2 (n)), n =
0, 1, 2, ...}. Notice that Z1 (n) is the total number of individuals (type T1 ) in the
n-th day infected by the individuals of the (n − 1)-th day; Z2 (n) is the total
number of the registered Covid-19 individuals (type T2 ) in the n-th day. The
process starts with Z1 (0) infected individuals, where Z1 (0) can be an integerPK
valued random variable with a p.g.f. h0 (s) = EsZ0 = k=1 p0k sk , |s| ≤ 1, or
(1)
Z0 = N for some integer value, N = 1, 2, ... . The random variable ξ1 (n; j) is
the number of individuals of type T1 in the n-th day infected by the j-th individual of type T1 from the (n − 1)-th day, j = 1, 2, ..., Z1 (n − 1). Similarly the
(1)
random variable ξ2 (n; j) is the number of the confirmed infected individuals
(type T2 ) in the n-th day transformed by the j-th infected individual type T1
from the (n − 1)-th day, j = 1, 2, ..., Z1 (n − 1).
(1)
(1)
Note that P{ξ2 (n; j) = 0} = 1 − q and P{ξ2 (n; j) = 1} = q. Hence
Z2 (n) ∈ Bi(Z1 (n − 1, q), i.e.
P{Z2 (n) = i|Z1 (n − 1) = l} = (li )q i (1 − q)l−i , i = 0, 1, ..., l; l = 0, 1, 2, ...
In other words the probability q can be interpreted as a proportion of the
confirmed individuals in the day n among all infected individuals in the day
n − 1.
Let h0 (s) = EsZ1 (0) , F1 (n; s) = E(sZ1 (n) ), F2 (n; s) = E(sZ2 (n) ). Introduce
the following p.g.f.
Pk
(5) h∗ (s) = h1 (s, 1) = q + p0 + j=1 pj sj , e
h(s) = h1 (1, s) = 1 − q + qs.
Then it is not difficult to check that for n = 0, 1, 2, ..., we are able to obtain
the p.g.f. of the process:
(6) F1 (n; s) = E(sZ1 (n) ) = F1 (n − 1; h∗ (s)) = F1 (0; h∗n (s))
= h0 (h∗ (h∗ (...(h∗ (s))...))),
(7) F2 (n; s) = E(sZ2 (n) ) = F1 (n − 1; e
h(s)) = F1 (0; e

Let m = ds h (s)|s=1 = Eξ1 = j=1 jpj be the mean value of the new in(1)

fected individuals by one infected individual. Note that ds
h(s)|s=1 = Eξ2 = q
is the mean value of the registered infected individuals by one infected individd
ual. Introduce also m0 = EZ1 (0) = ds
h0 (s)|s=1 . Therefore

M1 (n) = EZ1 (n) = m0 mn , n = 0, 1, 2, ...,

4

(10) M2 (n) = EZ2 (n) = qEZ1 (n − 1) = qm0 mn−1 , n = 1, 2, ...; EZ2 (0) = 0.
Notice that the asymptotic behaviour of the process depends essentially of
parameter m. Especially, if m > 1 (supercritical case) then the mean value of
the infected individuals M1 (n) grows exponentially, in the critical case m = 1
it is a constant and for m < 1 (subcritical case) M1 (n) → 0 as n → ∞.
We will use these results to present in the next section a more complicated
model with immigration.
Note that we can observe only Z2 (1), Z2 (2), ..., Z2 (n). What can be estimated
with these observations?
2 (n+1)
Note first that EZ
EZ2 (n) = m. Hence we can consider
2 (n+1)
(11)
m
b n = ZZ
, n = 1, 2, ....,
2 (n)
as an estimator of the parameter m (similar to Lotka-Nagaev estimator for the
classical BGW branching process). It is possible to use also the following Harris
type estimatorP

mn,N = i=n+1 Z2 (i)/ j=n
Z2 (j), n = 1, 2, ...; N = 1, 2, ....
(13)
See [12] for more details.
Estimating m we are able to predict the mean value of the infected (non
observed) individuals in the population. In the case when we assume that
Z1 (0) = 1 then M1 (n) = EZ1 (n) can be approximated respectively by m
b nn , or
m
e nn , or mnn,N . In fact it means that we can obtain three types of estimators
c1 (n) = m
f1 (n) = m
(14) M
b nn , M
e nn and M 1 (n) = mnn,N .
In other words we could say that we have at least three prognostic lines.
Therefore if we have the observations (Z2 (1), Z2 (2), ..., Z2 (n)) over the first n
days, we are able to predict the mean value of the infected individuals for the
next k days by the relations:
c1 (n+k) = m
f1 (n+k) = m
(15) M
b n+k

We are able to estimate also the proportion α(n) of the registered infected
individuals among the population in the n-th day. Then we can obtain the
c1 (n)}, α
following three types of estimators: α
b(n) = Z2 (n)/{Z2 (n) + M
e(n) =
f1 (n)}, α(n) = Z2 (n)/{Z2 (n) + M 1 (n)}.
Z2 (n)/{Z2 (n) + M
All obtained estimators will be presented by the observed registered labconfirmed cases. The quality of the estimation, however, depends on the representativeness of the sample due to the specifics of the data collection in each
country.
Remark 1. In fact our model (4) can be generalized as non-homogeneous

Notice that in this case EZ

3. The two-type branching process with immigration as model of
Covid-19 epidemic development.
The model considered in Section 2 assumes that the process of infection
begins with some random number of infected immigrants and then the immigration process is bounded and it is not essential for the Covid-19 population
dynamics. But in some cases the role of the immigration process cannot be
negligible. That is why we will introduce random variables {In }, where In gives
the number of infected immigrants in the n − th day which take part in the
process of infection. We will assume first that {In } are iid r.v. with a p.g.f.
Pl
(18)
g(s) = EsIn = k=0 gk sk , |s| ≤ 1.
Then instead of (4) we will consider the following branching process with
immigration
PY1 (n−1) (1)
PY1 (n−1) (1)
(19) Y1 (n) = j=1
ξ1 (n; j) + In , Y2 (n) = j=1
ξ2 (n; j), n = 1, 2, ...,
(1)

(1)

where the vectors {(ξ1 (n; j), ξ2 (n; j)} are independent and identically dis(1) (1)
tributed as (ξ1 , ξ2 ) with p.g.f. (1) − (3) and they are also independent of
{In }. We can assume that Y1 (0) > 0 is some random variable independent of
(1)
(1)
{(ξ1 (n; j), ξ2 (n; j)} and {In }, and also the case Y2 (0) = 0. Another possible
assumption is Y1 (0) = Y2 (0) = 0, which means that in fact the process starts
with the first real immigrants.
Interpretation: Y1 (n) is the total number of individuals (type T1 ) in the
n-th day infected by the individuals of the (n − 1)-th day plus the new infected
immigrants In ; Y2 (n) is the total number of the officially registered infected
individuals (type T2 ) in the n-th day.
Then it is not difficult to check that for n = 0, 1, 2, ..., we are able to obtain
from (18) and (19) the p.g.f.’s of the process:
∗
G1 (n; s) = E(sY1 (n) ) = g(s)G1 (n − 1; h∗ (s)) = f (h∗n (s))Πn−1

PN
f (s) = EsY1 (0) = k=0 fk sk , |s| ≤ 1.

Pn−2
(22) A2 (n) = EY2 (n) = qA1 (n − 1) = qa k=0 mk ,
where it is assumed that A1 (0) = EY1 (0) = 0 and the parameters m and q are
well defined in Section 2 by (5).
Hence from (21) and (22) one has
(23) A1 (n) = a(mn − 1)/(m − 1), m 6= 1, and A1 (n) = an, m = 1,
(24) A2 (n) = qa(mn−1 − 1)/(m − 1), m 6= 1, and A2 (n) = qa(n − 1), m = 1

6

Therefore by (23) and (24) one obtains as n → ∞
A1 (n) ∼ amn /(m − 1), m > 1; A1 (n) = an, m = 1; A1 (n) → a/(1 − m), m < 1,
qa
A2 (n) ∼ qamn−1 /(m − 1), m > 1; A2 (n) ∼ qan, m = 1; A1 (n) → 1−m
, m < 1.
In the general case A1 (0) = EY1 (0) = M0 > 0 and instead of (19) and (20)
one has
Pn−1
(25) A1 (n) = M0 mn + a k=0 mk ,
Pn−2
(26) A2 (n) = q(M0 mn−1 + a k=0 mk ).
We would like to point out once again that we can observe only the statistics
Y2 (1), Y2 (2), ..., Y2 (n) and we have to use for estimation only these observations.
2 (n+1)
Notice first that for m ≥ 1 we obtain limn→∞ EY
EY2 (n) = m. Hence for large
enough n we can consider
(27)
m
b n = Y2 (n + 1)/Y2 (n)
as an estimator of the parameter m (similar to Lotka-Nagaev estimator for the
classical BGW branching process). It is possible to use also for m > 1 and large
enough n the following

or Crump and Hove
Pn+ttype estimators
Pn+t−1
mn,t = i=n+1 Y2 (i)/ j=n Y2 (j).
(29)
See [12] for more details.
Estimating m > 1 we are able to predict the mean value of the infected
(non observed) individuals in the population. In the case when we assume
that the process begins with the first immigrants then A1 (n) = EY1 (n) can be
approximated using the estimators (27) − (29).
The problem is how to estimate the immigration mean a. First of all there is
an special case when a = m. Then using (23) and (24) with the Harris estimator
we have
e1 (n) = m
e1 (n) = m
(30) A
e n (m
e nn − 1)/(m
e n − 1), m > 1; A
e n n, m = 1.
In general we have to use some additional information. For
Pn example, if we
can observe {Ik } then we can apply the estimator a∗n = n−1 k=1 Ik . Hence
e1 (n) = a∗n n, m = 1.
e1 (n) = a∗n (m
e n − 1), m > 1; A
e nn − 1)/(m
(31)
A
One can proceed similarly for the other estimators m
b nn and mnn,N .
Remark 2. Similarly as it is shown in Remark 1 from Section 2 the model
(19) can be generalized in the case with non-homogeneous in time offspring

h (l; s)|s=1 = Eξ1 (l) = j=1 jpj (l) will
be the mean value of the new infected individuals by one infected individual in
the day l = 1, 2, .... Therefore instead (25) we obtain
Pn−1
(32)
A1 (n) = EY1 (n) = M0 Πnl=1 m(l) + a k=0 Πkl=1 m(l).
3. Estimating of the main parameter and some predictions.
Recall that both type processes with or without immigration have exponential growth in the supercritical case m > 1. In the critical case m = 1 and in
the subcritical case m < 1 the asymptotic behaviour is essentially different. In
the critical case the mean value of the process with immigration grows linearly
while for the process without immigration the mean value is constant. In the
subcritical case the mean value of the immigration process converges to a positive constant but for the process without immigration the mean value limit is
7

equal to zero. The estimation of the immigration mean a cannot be estimated
by the observed statistics and we need some additional information.
We would like to point out once again that the considered in Section 2 model
is versatile but the application in each country is specific because it depends
essentially on the official data from the country. The plots and tables below
illustrate well some specific details for different countries as well as the common
trend.
The data used for the estimation of the parameters of the model come from
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [21].
We will consider first the process without immigration. Note that the observed data is the number of the newly (daily) registered individuals denoted
by Z2 (n). The data about the new number of infected individuals (denoted by
Z1 (n)) is unobservable. The initial number m0 = EZ1 (0) is also unknown. Here
n is the corresponding day from the beginning of the infection.
The estimation of the parameters of the defined model can be summarized
in the following steps.
1. On the basis of each sample Z2 (1), . . . , Z2 (s), s = 1, . . . , n, the mean
numbers of the new infected individuals by one infected individual is estimated by the considered above estimators but we present only the results
for Harris type estimator.
2. The mean values of the expected number of nonregistered infected individuals are calculated for the Harris estimator as M1 (s + k) = m0 ms+k =
M1 (s)mk . Here, instead of m0 the value of M1 (s) is estimated by the registered contaminated individuals in day s. For the purpose of the study, the
value of s is set to 20 days before the end of observed data, i.e. s = n − 20.
3. The proportion α(n) of the registered contaminated individuals among
the population of all infected in the n-th day is estimated by the formula
f1 (n)}.
α
e(n) = Z2 (n)/{Z2 (n) + M
4. The expected number of individuals in the model with immigration A1 (n) =
EY1 (n) is calculated using equation (25), based on the Harris estimator,
calculated above.
5. The obtained results are presented with 95 % confident intervals.
Firstly, we will demonstrate the approach described above by the data of the
reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 daily cases for USA provided by the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [21] (the data are retrieved
on 02.05.2020).
Table 1 represents the estimated model parameters for the last 5 days of the
available data set. Every row in the table represents the Harris estimate m̃n , as
well as it’s 95 % confidence interval ( CIl - CIr ), the proportion of the registered
infected individuals α(n) and the expected values of the non-confirmed cases M1
( or A1 for the process with immigration) , based on n − k observations, i.e.
Z2 (1), ..., Z2 (n − k); k = 0, ..., 4.

Table 1: Estimation of the model parameters
The following figures Figure 1 - 6 represent the parameters of the process
for the USA data.

Figure 1: Number of the daily reported laboratory-confirmed cases
Figure 1 shows the increments Y2 (n) - the number of the daily reported
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
Pn cases. The related cumulative values (the number of the total registered i=1 Y2 (i)) are presented on Figure 2 exhibiting a
strong exponential growth.

A comparison between the Harris type and Lotka-Nagaev type estimators
of the growth rate (the mean value of the newly infected individuals by one
infected individual) can be seen on Figure 3. After the initially large estimated
values it stabilizes below 1.1, which is determined by the branching processes
theory as a slightly supercritical process. This corresponds to the exponential
growth shown above. The next results shows that the Harris type estimator has
more stable behaviour than the Lotka-Nagaev type estimator.

The estimates of the proportion of the officially registered lab-confirmed
cases among all infected in the population can be seen on Figure 4. During the
most recent days their values are approximately 0.8. This means that nearly
80% of the infected individuals have been tested, confirmed and registered.

Figure 4: Proportion of the officially registered lab-confirmed cases
On Figure 5 the expected number of the nonregistered infected individuals
by days can be seen. The last 5 points on the graph represent the 95% confidence
interval for the forecast.
The expected number of the nonregistered infected individuals in both cases
- with and without immigration, are compared on Figure 6.

Similar results for all countries in the world are available at our specially
constructed site http://ir-statistics.net/covid-19. The data is provided daily by
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [21]. The results are
updated every 24 hours.
The last 5 days results for Italy, Germany, France, Spain and Bulgaria can
be compared on Table 2 (the data are retrieved on 02.05.2020).
The value of the proportion of the registered infected individuals is considerably higher in USA and France than in Germany and Italy, while countries with
a longer infection period observe relatively small values of the Harris estimator
of the mean value of the number of the confirmed infected individuals by one
infected individual. Even more, the lower boundary of the confidence interval
for the Harris estimator falls beneath the value of 1.
Using the same data set one can compare the infection rate for different
countries and regions on the basis of the estimated growth rate. For example,
on Table 3, the 10 countries with lowest and highest growth rate are shown.
Even in the cases where the infection growth is less than 1, the upper bound
of the confidence interval goes above 1, which states that there is a possibility
that the infection growth will increase in the future.
In the countries, where the infection is growing, the growth rate is isoclinically above 1, even though the lower boundary of the confidence interval is less

than 1. It is usually due to the small number of observed infected individuals.
5. Concluding remarks.
First of all the estimation of the mean value of reproduction m allows us
to classify the contamination process as supercritical (m > 1), critical (m = 1)
and subcritical (m < 1). Recall that both type processes with or without
immigration have exponential growth in the supercritical case m > 1. In the
critical case m = 1 and in the subcritical case m < 1 the asymptotic behaviour
is essentially different. In the critical case the mean value of the process with
immigration grows linearly while for the process without immigration the mean
value is constant. In the subcritical case the mean value of the immigration
process converges to a positive constant but for the process without immigration
the mean value limit is equal to zero.
Finally the estimating of the mean parameter of infection can be considered
as a first stage to construction of a more complicated epidemiological model. As
an example, one can use a branching process with random migration considered
in [17 − 19] or some other model of controlled branching processes (see [8]). But
for a general pandemic model the collaboration with specialists of epidemiology, mathematics, medicine, microbiology, molecular biology and informatics
is absolutely necessary for the application of all information about Covid-19
phenomenon.
Remark 3. For more detailed investigation and simulation the following
models can be applied in the considered situation:

16

Pk
(i) h∗ (s) = q + p0 + p1 s + p2 s2 + ... + pk sk , where q = 1 − j=0 pj and
pj , j = 0, 1, ..., k, can be specially
P∞ chosen for k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
(ii) h∗ (s) = q + p0 + k=1 (1 − p)pk sk = q + p0 + (1 − p)ps)/(1 − ps),
where q + p0 = 1 − p. It is possible to consider also the restricted geometrical
distribution up to some k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
P∞
k
(iii) h∗ (s) = q + p0 + k=1 e−λ λk! sk = q + p0 + e−λ(1−s) − e−λ , where
q + p0 = e−λ . Similarly it is possible to consider also the restricted Poisson
distribution up to some k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
Note that the parameters of these distributions can be set in the manner that
d ∗
h
(s)|s=1 is equal to m
b n , or m
e n , or mn,N . Then with this individual distrids
butions it is possible to simulate the trajectories of the non-observed process of
infection for further studies.
