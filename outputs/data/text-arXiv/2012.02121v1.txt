Abstract
Purpose – While the literature presents various advantages of using blended learning,
policymakers must identify the barriers and challenges faced by students that may cripple
their online learning experience. Understanding these barriers can help academic
institutions craft policies to advance and improve the students' online learning
experience. This study was conducted to determine the challenges of computing
students in one private University in the Philippines during the period where the entire
Luzon region was placed under the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) as a response
to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Method – A survey through MS Forms Pro was performed to identify the experiences of
students in online learning. The survey ran from March 16 to March 18, 2020, which
yielded a total of 300 responses.

Results – Descriptive statistics revealed that the top three barriers and challenges
encountered by students were 1.) the difficulty of clarifying topics or discussions with the
professors, 2.) the lack of study or working area for doing online activities, and 3.) the lack
of a good Internet connection for participating in online activities.
Conclusion – It can be concluded that both students and faculty members were not fully
prepared to undergo full online learning. More so, some faculty members may have failed
to adapt to the needs of the students in an online learning environment.
Recommendations – While the primary data of the study mainly came from the students,
it would also be an excellent addition to understand the perspective of the faculty
members in terms of their experiences with their students. Their insights could help
validate the responses in the survey and provide other barriers that may not have been
included in the study.
Practical Implications – The study has revealed gaps in online learning as experienced by
the computing students, which can help the management craft a holistic framework
encompassing both the learners and teachers for a successful online learning experience
for the students.

INTRODUCTION
The rapid advancement of technology has dramatically revolutionized our education
system. The use of technology (e.g., Internet, Mobile Devices, Augment Reality, Virtual
Reality) has led to pedagogical evolution (Chilton & McCracken, 2017), creating a
paradigm shift in education. In recent years, studies have been conducted to determine
how Mobile Learning, which makes use of mobile devices, create a better learning
experience for learners (Almaiah, Jalil, & Man, 2016; Alrasheedi, Capretz, & Raza, 2016;
Fabito, 2017). As more mobile devices become connected to the Internet, the growing
implication for online learning adoption has been increasing.
Online learning is one of the methods used by Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs)
to support traditional learning (Janse van Rensburg, 2018). The use of modern tools such
as email, audio, and video teleconferencing for online learning (Schindler, Burkholder,
Morad, & Marsh, 2017) are some of the tools that can be used by academicians (Rabacal,
2018) to augment the delivery of education. The combination of both using online
learning and face to face instruction has paved the way for what is now known as
Blended Learning (Rasheed, Kamsin, & Abdullah, 2020). Blended learning is advantageous
442

among faculty members and learners due to the limitations brought about by traditional
learning. Students who are restricted to physical space and time in a classroom setting
may gain access to online resources (Calamlam, 2016), collaborate among students, and
connect with faculty members in real-time through PCs, Laptops, Mobile Phones, and
Tablets.
Although the literature has presented the benefits of Blended Learning in the
Philippine setting (Calamlam, 2016; Rabacal, 2018), it is crucial to understand the barriers
that hamper students to embrace online learning. In times of calamities and natural
disasters that force HEIs to shift to online learning suddenly, institutions must understand
the accessibility of students to participate in online learning before it happens. The
success of online learning can occur when the management can address the issues of
students in the conduct of online learning.
In the field of computing, the requirement varies with other programs as some
professional subjects would require devices with specific hardware needs for
programming and other computing courses ("Student Computing Requirements Information Technology - University of Florida," n.d.). Understanding this crucial
component is a must to implement online learning without relaxing the needed course
outcomes effectively.
With this said, the purpose of the study was to determine the challenges and barriers
of computing students in online learning, particularly in one private University in the
Philippines. While there seemed to be a plethora of literature that sought to understand
possible barriers and challenges of blended learning (Janse van Rensburg, 2018; Rasheed
et al., 2020; Sun & Chen, 2016), what made this study unique was its general focus on
computing students as the needed requirement for blended learning varies with other
degree programs. One other example where specific requirements vary in online
education is the nursing degree program (Smith, Passmore, & Faught, 2009).

METHODOLOGY
This study was conducted when Luzon, one of the major islands in the Philippines,
was placed under Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), which started on March 17,
2020, until April 13, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic ("Community Quarantine
over the Entire Luzon," n.d.). During this period, classes all over Luzon were suspended,
including Metro-Manila. However, as early as March 9, 2020, classes in Metro-Manila were
already suspended due to the growing cases of COVID-19. This prompted most HEIs to
immediately shift to online learning. Students and faculty members were barred from
entering the school campus and were asked to use online learning so as not to disrupt the
academic calendar. Starting on March 9, most schools went online.
From the period of March 9 to March 16, students and faculty members of the
computing department of one private University in Metro Manila, Philippines, had the
443

chance to experience full online learning. During that period, much data can already be
obtained to understand the possible challenges of students in an online learning
environment.
This study was conducted using descriptive statistics whose data was made available
through a survey utilizing MS Forms Pro. Before the conduct of the survey, the
researchers asked for some inputs from selected students about their difficulties in online
learning. This served as the basis for the revised questionnaire. The survey was
administered by the student council of the computing department to avoid possible
biases and influence from the faculty members.
The online survey was conducted from March 16 until March 18, 2020, where most
students were still online. For the three (3) day period, a total of 300 responses were
obtained. The survey questionnaire includes questions attributed to 1.) Availability of
Devices, 2.) Internet Connectivity and Reliability, and 3.) Other issues that may hamper
the students' online engagement. Aside from the multiple-choice option, an open-ended
question was included to give them the chance to express their thoughts on how the
department can improve their learning experience online.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Below presents the results of the online survey conducted among the students of one
private University in Manila. Table 1 shows the breakdown of the respondents.

From the 300 respondents, 58 were BSCS students, and 242 were from the BSIT
program. This number was not as surprising as most enrollees in the computing
department were enrolled in the latter. For the year level, the 2nd year or sophomore
students had the greatest number of responses yielding 140 or 47% of the entire
population. This is followed by 1st year or freshmen students with total respondents of
104 representing 35% of the whole respondents and, lastly, the irregular students (3rd-year
or 4th-year students) comprising only 55 or 18% of the entire respondents. The Philippines
implemented the K to 12 Basic Education Program, and there are still no regular students
444

in their third or fourth year of tertiary education. The small number of respondents from
the 3rd-year and 4th-year students was those who did not go through the program.

Devices used for Online Learning
The next two Figures (1 and 2) represent the devices used by the students in online
learning. Figure 1 shows the result per program, whereas Figure 2 describes the result per
year level

Figure 1. Devices used in Online Learning per Program

Figure 2. Devices used in Online Learning per Year Level

445

Figure 1 shows that almost half of the respondents are using computers and laptops
for online learning. Out of the 234 respondents from the IT program, 105 or 44.87 % use a
desktop computer or laptop, while 35 or 14.95% of students have to rent a PC in a
computer or internet shop to participate in online learning. On the other hand, 91 or
38.8% of them are using smartphones to access the Internet. Only 11 or 0.04% do not have
any device that can be used for online learning. The same pattern is also true for CS
students. From a total of 58 respondents, 50% have computers or laptops, while 9 or
15.51% rent a computer, and 20 or 34% make use of smartphones. Two (2) or 3% of CS
students do not have access to the Internet. This outlook represents a big issue for
computing students doing online learning. As already mentioned, specific devices should
be available as some professional courses would require minimum device specifications.
And one of these is a laptop or a desktop PC ("Student Computing Requirements Information Technology - University of Florida," n.d.).
In terms of how it varies per year level, looking at Figure 2, we can infer that most of
the 2nd year students make use of desktop PCs or laptops to participate in online learning
in comparison to freshmen students. Comparing to 55.71% (78 out of 140) of sophomore
students, freshmen students only have 29.5% (31 out of 105) who make use of PCs or
laptops. However, if combined with the computer rental, that would make 49.5% (52 out
of 105) of the entire freshmen students. In terms of using smartphone devices, it can be
observed that 28.5% (50 out of 140) of IT students and 47.61% (50 out of 105) of CS
students can engage in online learning through their mobile devices. With the
advancement in mobile technologies, modern smartphones can now perform some
flexibilities of a computer (Fabito, 2017). Additionally, some Windows and Mac-based
applications can now be installed in Android and iOS-based smartphones making onlinebased applications for PCs available in smartphones (Pilar, Jorge, & Cristina, 2013). Hence,
some students rely on smartphones if PCs and laptops are not available.

Internet Accessibility
While internet accessibility is one of the crucial components for a student to
participate in online learning, Figure 3 presents the variation of how students access the
Internet. From the chart, it can be noted that very few have no access to the Internet.
This only represents 8% (24 out of 300) of the entire population. The twenty-four
responses are a combination of those who do not have an appropriate device (Figure 1)
and a reliable internet connection (Figure 5)

446

Figure 3. Internet Accessibility of Students

Merging the first two items (Availability of devices and Internet accessibility), Figure 4
illustrates the data connectivity available for the devices used by the students. For
desktop or laptop users, out of the 132 users, 82 or 62% have an unlimited data
connection. This is followed by 48 or 36% on prepaid data connection, and the remaining
two (2) or 2 gets the internet connection from a computer shop or has no available
connection. As already stated, while a personal computer or laptop is necessary for
computing courses, an Internet connection is also essential to participate in live meetings
and online assessments. Looking at the data, only 27% (82 out of 300) of the entire
respondents may have the full potential to take advantage of online learning - a computer
and an unlimited internet connection. For those using smartphones, out of the 111 users, it
can be observed that the majority (72 or 65%) of the smartphone users are connected to a
prepaid internet service connection. In contrast, only 25 or 23% have an unlimited data
connection. This goes to show that smartphone users tend to spend more just to be
connected to the Internet. According to a news article, the Philippines, aside from having
the slowest Internet connection in Asia, it is also one of the most expensive ("LIST:
Philippines ranks 21st of 22 Asian countries in Internet download speed," n.d.) Overall, the
data tells us that most PC and Laptop users have an unlimited internet connection, while
smartphone users tend to use prepaid data for their online needs.
From the 44 students who answered that they rent a PC to a computer shop, only 29
or 66 % responded that they get an Internet connection from the shop. The other 8 or 18%
do not have an Internet connection. This may be true since some computer shops only
offer network games. The computers utilized in this case are for solving offline
computing problems (e.g., programming activities). The last 7 or 16% may seem irrelevant
as it cannot be justified conclusively.

447

The authors, however, agree that there might be a few items that have not been
adequately answered by the respondents. The same goes for the 13 respondents who
noted that they do not have any device that can be used for online learning. From the 13
responses, only 8 or 62% have recorded that they do not have an internet connection or
do not have appropriate devices. The remaining 5 or 38% responses seemed to be illogical.
However, given some minute discrepancies, the general picture observed in both surveys
tells us that more than half of the respondents do not have an adequate device to
perform computing activities meant to be answered outside the school campus.
Additionally, a continuous Internet connection also holds a challenge to everyone as it is
limited only to a few students. The reliability of the Internet connection, however, is a
different story that will be discussed in the next section.

Internet Reliability
As already stated, a continuous internet connection is necessary for students to fully
engaged in online learning. This is true, especially when an online meeting is required for
all subjects enrolled. However, variables may come to play that would inhibit continuous
internet connection. Aside from being one of the most expensive internet providers in
Asia, the Philippines is also one of the slowest ("LIST: Philippines ranks 21st of 22 Asian
countries in Internet download speed," n.d.). This can be reflected in the responses of the
students. As observed, out of the 300 students, only thirty-eight (38) or 13%o of them are
experiencing a fast and reliable internet connection.
On the other hand, sixty (60) or 20% are experiencing relatively fast internet
connection but is not always available. It often happens as there are times when the
internet connection is strong and would then subside in some occasions. In terms of the
poor connection, one-hundred thirteen (113) or 37% is experiencing slow connection but
sufficient to meet the requirement for their online activities. Overall, it can be interpreted
that two hundred eleven (211) or 70% of the respondents can somehow meet their
internet requirements for online learning.
Only seventy-seven (77) or 26% are experiencing slow connection and are not able to
meet their online requirements. This is followed by the twelve (12) or 4% without an
internet connection used at home.

448

449

Figure 5. Internet Reliability
Translating the reliability of the internet connection on the devices used by the
students, Figure 7 shows the comparison. The thirty-eight (38) responses representing
the fast and reliable connection in Figure 5 are shared among desktop or laptop users
(30), smartphone users (7), and computer shop users (1). From the 132 desktop or laptop
users, 30 or 23% have a fast and reliable internet connection. The other 31 or 23% is
experiencing fast connection but is not always reliable. What is obvious in the figure is the
fact that the majority of the respondents are experiencing slow connection but can fulfill
their online needs. This corresponds to 51 or 39% of the entire responses. Only 19 or 14% of
the 132 users have difficulty complying with the online learning requirements due to the
slow internet connection.
This trend is also the same for smartphone users. Out of the 111 respondents, 7 or 6%
experienced fast and reliable internet connection, 22 or 20% experienced fast but not
always a reliable connection, 49 or 44% experienced slow connection but is relatively able
to meet their online requirements, 32 or 29% experienced slow connection and is not able
to meet their online requirements and 1 or 1% without a data connection.
For those who use computer shops, it is interesting to find out that out of the 44
users, 54% of the users (24 responses) noted that the internet connection found on
computer or coffee shops are slow and is not able to meet their online learning internet
connectivity reliability. Only 16 or 36% can be identified as having a stable connection to
meet internet demand. Looking at the figures, another problem that computers or coffee
shop users tend to experience is the availability of internet reliability. On the other hand,
from the 13 responses that noted that they do not have any devices used for online
learning, 6 or 46% answered that they do not have an internet connection. The remaining
450

8 or 54% seemed to have an internet connection but does not have any device. This,
however, still needs validation, which the study was not able to perform.
Aside from the availability of devices, internet connectivity, and reliability, the survey
also looked at other issues that may hamper the students' online learning experience. The
questionnaire was partially obtained from students whom the authors had interviewed
before the survey was done. The items include internet accessibility and reliability (as a
way to validate the first three surveys), study areas, and the learning itself. Respondents
were able to select any of the choices portrayed in Figure 6.
Overall, the top three (3) issues selected, highlighted in color green, were the
following: 1.) The difficulty of clarifying topics or discussions with the professor, which
accounts for 169 or 56% of the 300 responses. 2.) Poor internet connection which
accounts for 168 or 56%, and 3.) Lack of good study area for online learning. This accounts
for 144 or 48% of the respondents.

From the result, it seemed that it is not just the devices or the internet connectivity
that is the problem addressed by the students in an online learning environment but also
the learning itself. Since online learning is limited to providing face-to-face engagement
and interactive discussion, a pedagogical design for online education should be well
established ("Five Pedagogical Practices to Improve Your Online Course," n.d.). Faculty
members need to learn certain skills and carefully craft methodologies suitable for online
learning, which includes the design, delivery, and assessment while providing social,
affective, and emotional support to students (Sharma, 2018). Only through a well
designed blended or online learning pedagogy would the learners and teachers fully
obtain the advantage of online learning (Heggart & Yoo, 2018; Shorey et al., 2018).
Admittedly, when faculty members were advised to do full online learning due to the
Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in Luzon, faculty members were not trained on
how to do online learning effectively. In recent years, the LMS used by the computing
department was used primarily as a repository for class materials, uploading of
assignments, and for online exams. It was the first time for the computing department to
make full-blown online learning. Hence, there is a possibility of failing to adapt to the
learners' needs in online learning. This can be further validated by the open-ended
question included in the survey. Answers include that some faculty members from other
departments were merely adding videos and other learning resource materials in the
Learning Management System (LMS) used by the computing department. This is one
problem that may be common among faculty members if they are not adequately trained
to shift to online learning.
The second (2nd) barrier observed from the survey is the internet connectivity. This is
a validation found in Figure 3, which shows that very few are connected to a fast and
reliable internet connection. Lastly, the third (3rd) issue observed is the lack of a
functional study area for the learners. Unlike in a school setting, where learning is more
conducive, students were not adequately prepared to go online learning at home. The
abrupt decision to go online due to the ECQ brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic has
become an eye-opener in terms of the lack of preparedness of students and faculty
members to go online. Although an LMS is employed in the computing department for
years now, it goes to show that both students and faculty members are not prepared to
do full online learning for an extended period.
Surprisingly, the survey has also revealed that only one hundred ten (110) selected "I
lack the device to participate in online activities", which is the 5th among the eight issues
provided. Although there were only one hundred thirty-two (132) who selected that they
have laptops or PCs, it was not the priority in terms of their concerns. As already
mentioned, PCs and Laptops are necessary when performing programming or other
computing problems. While several reasons can explain this, one conclusive justification
could be that since the majority of the students are just starting in their career (1st year
and 2nd Year), most of their subjects are not professional subjects but minor subjects.
Another possible reason is that faculty members may be cautious about providing

453

computing problems as they are aware of the difficulties faced by the students.
However, a follow-up study must still be conducted to understand the result further.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This study has provided insights concerning the barriers of computing students in
online learning. Looking at the results of the survey, it shows that aside from the lack of
computers or laptops, which is necessary for solving computing problems, internet
connectivity also poses a problem. To aid the need for a desktop PC or laptops for
students, the development of mobile apps may be explored that can help simulate
professional subjects such as programming and web development. Mobile apps may
provide functionalities that are observable in computers. However, the effectiveness of
the app is another endeavor that researchers can investigate.
The survey has also shown that faculty members may have failed to adapt to the
needs of the students in an online learning environment. Hence, there is a need for
faculty members to undergo training that would allow them to design a pedagogy suited
for online learning. The management should adopt a policy that would institute
continuous training and monitoring for faculty members to address the pedagogical
concerns of students in online learning.
While the primary data of the study mainly came from the students, it would also be
an excellent addition to understand the perspective of the faculty members in terms of
their experiences with their students. Their insights could help validate the responses in
the survey and provide other barriers that may not have been included in the study.
Subsequently, studying the restrictions of faculty members in online learning, including
their participation, would also be necessary when crafting a holistic framework
encompassing both the learners and teachers for successful online learning for the
computing students. Once a framework is developed and tested, similar to the study of
(Han, Wang, & Jiang, 2019), it can help provide administrators and policymakers advance
online learning implementation in the University.
