Abstract—This work takes a first look at domain names related
to COVID-19 (Cov19doms in short), using a large-scale registered
Internet domain name database, which accounts for 260M of
distinct domain names registered for 1.6K of distinct top-level
domains. We extracted 167K of Cov19doms that have been
registered between the end of December 2019 and the end of
September 2020. We attempt to answer the following research
questions through our measurement study: RQ1: Is the number of
Cov19doms registrations correlated with the COVID-19 outbreaks?,
RQ2: For what purpose do people register Cov19doms? Our chief
findings are as follows: (1) Similar to the global COVID-19
pandemic observed around April 2020, the number of Cov19doms
registrations also experienced the drastic growth, which, interestingly, pre-ceded the COVID-19 pandemic by about a month,
(2) 70 % of active Cov19doms websites with visible content
provided useful information such as health, tools, or product
sales related to COVID-19, and (3) non-negligible number of
registered Cov19doms was used for malicious purposes. These
findings imply that it has become more challenging to distinguish
domain names registered for legitimate purposes from others and
that it is crucial to pay close attention to how Cov19doms will
be used/misused in the future.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Several researchers have conducted Internet measurement
studies to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected
the Internet and user behaviors [8], [4], [9], [15], [2]. Favale
et al. and Feldmann et al. [8], [9] explored the changes in
Internet traffic, Lutu et al. [15] explored the changes in traffic
and its impact on user mobility in mobile operators, Candela
et al. [4] analyzed the impact of Internet traffic changes on
network latency, and Boettger et al. [2] analyzed the changes in

social media access patterns and the implications. The details
of these studies will be discussed in Section V.
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no academic
study that has analyzed the impact of COVID-19 in terms
of registered domain names. This work takes a first look at
domain names related to COVID-19 (Cov19doms in short),
using a large-scale set of registered domain names. We note
that the only literature we have been able to find on this
subject is a blog article [6], which analyzed the domain
names associated with COVID-19. The article reported that the
number of COVID-19 domain name registrations has spiked
in mid-March 2020, with some days seeing the registration
of more than 5,000 Cov19doms. However, we found that the
data used in the article contained many false positives due to
the naive string match heuristics. Also, this data is no longer
updated since May 2020, so we cannot perform a longer-term
analysis using the data. In this study, we attempt to extract
Cov19doms accurately and analyze how it changes over a long
period of time.
With so many of us keeping an eye on COVID-19 and
spending more and more of our time online, it is crucial to
understand the origins and implications of Cov19doms. Given
these backgrounds in mind, we attempt to answer the following
research questions:
RQ1: Is the number of Cov19doms registrations correlated
with the COVID-19 outbreaks?
RQ2: For what purpose do people register Cov19doms?
To address the research questions, we compiled an exhaustive list of Cov19doms using a large-scale registered Internet
domain name database [7], which accounted for 260M of
distinct domain names registered for the 1.6K of top-level

domains. Using the dataset, we found that at least 167K of
distinct Cov19doms containing strings such as “covid” or
“corona” have been registered from the end of December
2019 to the end of September 2020. We attempt to study
how domain name registration behavior changed with the
emergence of COVID-19; i.e., we examine whether or not
the time-series of COVID-19 infections is correlated with the
time series of domain name registrations.
Next, from the 167K of Cov19doms, we extracted active
websites that used Cov19doms by checking DNS A record and
HTTP/HTTPS response. We then randomly sampled 10,000 of
the Cov19doms websites to study how Cov19doms are used
in the wild. By applying cluster analysis to the screenshots,
we systematically classified 10K websites. For the remaining
general websites, we performed manual inspection with the
aid of three evaluators. We also leveraged online virus-testing
services to check whether some Cov19doms were used for
malicious activities.
Our chief findings are as follows:
• Similar to the global COVID-19 pandemic observed
around April 2020, the number of Cov19doms registrations also experienced drastic growth, which, surprisingly, preceded the COVID-19 pandemic by about a
month.
• 70 % of active Cov19doms websites with visible content
provided useful information such as health, tools, or
product sales related to COVID-19.
• Non-negligible number (roughly 4%) of registered
Cov19doms have been used for malicious purposes such
as phishing or malware distribution.
These findings imply that it has become more challenging
to distinguish between domain names registered for legitimate
purposes and those that are not. It was also indicated that
it is necessary for researchers who analyze domain names,
and even operators and blacklisters who take security measures based on domain names to pay close attention to
how Cov19doms currently parked or in preparation will be
used/misused in the future.
II. DATA
A. Collecting Cov19doms
To collect registered Cov19doms, we used a large-scale
commercial domain name database, domainlist.io [7]. This
database contains snapshots of approximately 260M domain
names taken from 1.6K of different TLDs, and we continued
to retrieve data daily from 27 December 2019 to 20 September
2020. Of the 98, 940, 555 domain names that have been newly
registered since December 27, 2019, we first extracted the domain names that contained “covid” or “corona” as a substring.
As a result, we obtained a total of 170, 846 Cov19doms. We
note that this approach could include false positives such as
“covideo.co.uk”, for instance. However, we can safely ignore
the effect of false positives in the following analysis, as our
manual inspection of the randomly sampled data showed that
the occurrence of such false positives was extremely rare as

these words are. We believe that these words, especially in the
COVID-19 era, are mostly used in the context of a specific
purpose, i.e., “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2,” resulting in fewer false positives.
To study the characteristics of the Cov19doms, it is essential
that we can get information about the creation date of the
domain names. Therefore, we used the WHOIS information
for the extracted Cov19doms to obtain information on the date
and time the domain name was created. If the creation date
of a domain name was older than December 27, 2019, those
domain names were excluded from the following analysis.
This resulted in a total of 166,825 Cov19doms, as shown in
Table I. To ensure that domains registered before December
27, 2019 were not related to COVID-19, we manually checked
on them and found it be correct. In fact, most of them were
related to Coronado city in California, U.S.
We investigated where the specific words related to
COVID-19, i.e., “covid” and “corona”, are located in
the left-most labels of Cov19doms (e.g., “covidcare” in
covidcare[.]example) and confirmed that (a) 59.6% are
at the beginning, (b) 24.2% are at the end, and (c) 16.2%
are in the middle of them. The patterns (a) and (b) mean
that the left-most labels of Cov19doms were generated by
concatenating any character at the beginning or end of the
COVID-19-related words such as “covid”. We believe that
patterns (a) and (b) are less likely to cause false positives than
pattern (c). We further investigated the extent to which similar
COVID-19-related words, “covid”, “covid19”, and “covid19”, are included in Cov19doms and found that they are
41,718, 32,671, and 10,120 Cov19doms, respectively. These
numbers do not overlap, because we checked Cov19doms that
contain “covid19” and “covid-19” earlier. It is interesting that
“covid19” is more common in Cov19doms than its formal
name of the desease, “covid-19”. Among these, “covid” was
most frequently included in Cov19doms, and as far as we
manually checked, the majority of cases (about 40%) were
used in the context of the COVID-19. One of the reasons
why “covid” is included in Cov19doms in large numbers is
that there are cases where various numbers are added to the
end of “covid” (e.g., covid-2019, covid-2020, and covid-2021).
We expect those domain names to have been acquired for
speculative purposes.
We looked into what country registered Cov19doms firstest
by usinig WHOIS registrant information. Of the 165,185
Cov19doms we extracted, 153,243 domains had valid WHOIS
registrant country information. Among the countries, United
States was the first to register Cov19doms. The top-5 countries
registered Cov19doms were United States (85,970), Canada
(17,229), Panama (6,781), Germany (4,533) and United Kingdom (4,237).
B. Collecting Active Websites Using Cov19doms
With the aim of studying the usage of Cov19doms, we extract the active websites that are operating using Cov19doms.
To extract active websites, we first check the DNS A record
to determine if an IP address is assigned to the extracted

Cov19doms. We then send an HTTP/HTTPS request to the
domain name where the DNS A record exists, and record
the response. Specifically, we check if a connection can be
established to Port 80 and Port 443 of each host that had
a Cov19dom. Next, if a connection with either port can be
established, we made an HTTP/HTTPS request to those hosts
and checked whether the content could be retrieved from
them. This step removes websites that caused connection
timeouts and/or TLS errors such as invalid certificate. These
steps resulted in a total of 77,333 of active websites that use
Cov19doms, as shown in Table I.
III. M EASUREMENT S TUDY
Figure 1 presents an overview of the measurement processes. We first study the correlation between the number of
COVID-19 infections and the number of Cov19doms registrations (Sec III-A). For this analysis, we used the statistics
on the number of COVID-19 infections by country, provided
by WHO [22]. We then study how Cov19doms are used
for various websites (Sec III-B). The classification of active
websites operated using Cov19doms was manually performed
by three evaluators. Due to the large number of websites to
be analyzed, we conducted a random sampling study. Finally,
we report the analysis of Cov19doms that have been used
for malicious activities (Sec III-C). We used VirusTotal [1] to
investigate the presence of malicious sites using Cov19doms.
A. Number of new infections and Cov19doms registrations
We analyze the online behavior of people around the world
in response to the unprecedented event of COVID-19 through
the lens of DNS. Specifically, we examine whether or not the
time series of COVID-19 infections is correlated with the time
series of domain name registrations.
First, we investigate the time series of new registrations
of Cov19doms and the number of new COVID-19 infections
worldwide. We take all Cov19doms and split them into
groups of gTLDs (e.g., .com) and ccTLDs (e.g., .uk). We
obtained information on the number of COVID-19 infections
from the official WHO website [22]. Figure 2 shows the
time series of the number of new COVID-19 infections and
the number of new registrations in Cov19doms (gTLD and
ccTLD). These figures show that similar to the situation of
the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak around the world around
April 2020, Cov19doms saw a significant increase in its new
registrations as well. Surprisingly, the number of new domain
name registrations peaked around March 2020, about a month
ahead of the peak in the number of new COVID-19 infections.

Subsequently, the number of new registrations of Cov19doms
has reached a stable daily registration rate, but the number of
COVID-19 infections has still increasing as of October 2020.
Second, we focus on the Cov19doms of ccTLDs and investigate the relationship between the number of new registrations
of Cov19doms per ccTLD and the number of new COVID19 infections in the country corresponding to the ccTLD over
time. Our Cov19doms data included only four ccTLDs: United
Kingdom (.uk), Sweden (.se), Niue (.nu), and Australia
(.au). We excluded .nu, for which no information on the
number of WHO infected people existed from there, and
.au, for which we were unable to obtain the full domain
name registration date from the WHOIS data, and conducted
a survey of 4,766 .uk and 549 .se Cov19doms. Figure 3
shows the time-series change in the number of new infections
of Cov19doms and COVID-19 in the UK and Sweden, respectively. Since the lockdown was implemented in the UK, the
period is also shown in .uk graph. In both cases, Cov19doms
registrations tend to be more likely to be ahead of the COVID19 infection explosion. Furthermore, we find that registration
of Cov19doms moves faster and clearer in the UK than in the
Sweden case.
Our results obtained so far above indicate two things: (1)
events like COVID-19 that affect so many people’s lives
will create a massive demand for domain names and (2)
people are anticipating such demand and taking the action
of registering domain names at an amazingly early stage. In
subsequent sections, we will clarify for what purpose people
are registering these Cov19doms.
B. Understanding the Usage of Cov19doms
In general, automatic website classification is not an easy
task as the modern web is composed of rich and complex
multimedia, making it difficult to automatically analyze its
contents using simple data processing scheme. Therefore,
instead of fully automating the website classification process,
this work adopted manual inspection to ensure the quality
of the classification. However, the number of Cov19doms we
have collected is so large that it is infeasible to inspect them
all manually. Therefore, we took the approach of applying
random sampling to reduce the number of domains/websites to
be analyzed. As shown in Figure 1, we randomly sampled 10K
of websites from 77K active Cov19doms websites to reduce
the number of samples to be classified by human. For the
10K of randomly sampled Cov19doms websites, we took the
following two-stage approach.
In the first stage, we aim to systematically classify websites
into the following categories: Empty, Error, Parked, Hosted,
and Has content, where Empty represents cases in which
HTTP/HTTPS requests were responded to, but the data was
empty, Error represents the websites responded with error
codes such as 404 or 501, Parked represents the domain
parking websites, Hosted represents cases where the domain
name has been purchased, but the website only shows the
initial page after installation of Apache, WordPress, etc, and
Has content represents the remaining Cov19doms websites

that have some content. In the second stage, three evaluators
manually classify the websites classified as “Has content.” In
the following, we present the details of the analysis to be
performed at each stage and the results obtained.
1) Stage 1: Systematic Classification: We classify websites
into the five classes defined above based on HTTP/HTTPS
response codes and screenshot information. Among the five
classes, the classification of empty and error is simple. They
can be classified by analyzing the size of the data retrieved
and the response code. For the remaining classes parking and
hosted, we use cluster analysis. For parking, we could use domain name registrar information in some cases, however, our
preliminary study shows that we cannot do a comprehensive
study due to the existence of so many different domain parking
companies. The key idea is that the majority of websites that
are accessed for parking and hosted are similar in appearance.
Therefore, we apply cluster analysis to the screenshot images
and classify the websites by determining whether each cluster
is Parked or Hosted or Has content. With this approach, we
can streamline the classification.
To perform clustering of screenshot images, we need to
calculate the distance between images; i.e., it is necessary to
compute the similarity of images. There are several methods

for computing the similarity of images, and in this paper, we
adopt the perceptual hash (pHash) [23], which computes close
hash values for two similar images. pHash is widely used to
discover copyright infringement and is known to be effective
in discovering resemblances to certain images.
We first accessed 10K of randomly sampled active websites and extract HTML, screenshots, and other metadata
by navigating Google Chrome1 using Selenium [18]. The
language was set to English, and the User-Agent was set to
Windows 10 Google Chrome. To not halm the websites set
to be investigated, access to the IP address corresponding to
each Cov19dom is limited twice (HTTP and HTTPS). Next,
we computed the pHash values for the 10,000 screenshots
we collected, using imageHash [3]. We then grouped the
corresponding Cov19doms with the same value of pHash and
HTTP status code pairs into the same cluster. Table II presents
the classification result of the Cov19dom websites. From the
table, we can see that many of the Cov19doms websites
resulted in either domain parking or errors, and that 40% of the
websites (classified as “Has content”) requires detailed manual
inspection. We note that 60% of the websites categorized as

other than “Has content” do not currently provide any useful
content, however, they might start providing some content
in the future, so we need to pay attention to them. In the
following, we will classify the websites categorized as “Has
content.”
2) Stage 2: Manual Classification: In the second stage, we
will classify the Cov19doms websites marked as “Has content”
in the Stage 1. Since 4K of websites are too many to analyze
manually, further random sampling is performed and 1,000
general websites will be carefully classified by three evaluators. Through the Stage 1 classification, the classification
categories for Stage 2 were predetermined and provided to
the evaluators with detailed explanations. Figure 4 presents
a screenshot image of a tool developed by the authors to
help evaluators efficiently classify websites. Although the
evaluators made a classification based on screenshot image and
metadata, there are cases that cannot necessarily be determined
by screenshot or metadata. For example, if the evaluators could
not understand the language used in the web content, they also
leveraged external resources such as a search engine.
Three evaluators used the tool to classify 1,000 of websites
marked as “General” taking 4.8 hour on average, resulting in
477 websites where the three evaluators agreed, 423 websites

where the two evaluators agreed, and 100 websites where they
all disagreed. That is, for 90% of the websites, at least two
evaluators’ classification results were consistent. The result of
calculating the Fleiss’ kappa coefficient, which is a quantitative
measure of inter-rater agreement, was 0.50, which can be
interpreted as moderate agreement [13]. The results of the
interviews with the three evaluators revealed that the primary
reason for the disagreement was the difference in the decisions
they made when they were unsure of their classification.
One of the evaluators reported that he categorized all of
his confusion as “activities for COVID-19.” Discrepancies in
judgments also arose because of the existence of websites that
could be classified into multiple categories. For example, a
website that displays medical products (masks, face shields)
may be categorized as both Health and Sales. Apart from such
discrepancies, the classifications were generally consistent and
the manual classification results can be considered reasonable. In the final classification, a majority vote was adopted.
Websites with discrepancies between the three evaluators’
classification results were marked as “Unknown.”

Table III presents the classification results. About 70%
of the websites were related to COVID-19. Those websites
were medical services, selling products, providing COVID-19
information such as apps, maps and dashboards, supporting
people’s activities related to COVID-19, and social security. As
would be expected from the nature of COVID-19, the majority
of the websites (40%) were medical-related. Many of these
health-related websites are critical sources of information in
countering COVID-19 pandemic and should never be blocked.
The remaining 30% were completely irrelevant websites, websites with no content displayed, and “Unknown,” which we
defined earlier.

C. Malicious Activities Using Cov19doms
Finally, we investigate whether Cov19dom websites were
involved in any malicious activities. To achieve this goal, we
utilize VirusTotal, a large-scale online virus scanning service.
As shown in Figure 1, we target 10K of active websites
that had Cov19doms. Of the 10K websites, 6,362 of the
websites were detected as malicious by at least one or more
scanners. This is an alarming number, but when we analyzed
the detection results, we found that one online scanner detected
6,256 websites as malicious, and that the majority of them
(about 98.7%) were classified as phishing sites. Although we
cannot determine from our data whether or not these detections
were correct, the result does suggest that there may be a nonnegligible number of malicious sites that use Cov19doms.
On the other hand, one of the reasons why online scanners
may falsely detect Cov19doms as a phishing site is likely to

be naïve detection using keyword matching. For example, a
scheme that increases the probability of detecting a website
with a domain name containing the strings corona or covid19 as a malicious site could be employed. However, such an
approach might have the risk of blocking websites that provide
important information about COVID-19.
To reduce the effect of false positives from individual scanners, we examined websites that were detected as malicious
by at least two online scanners. We note that this approach is
consistent with the best practice used in many papers that make
use of multiple engines/vendors of VirusTotal for the labeling
task [16]. As a result, we found that the number was 357,
which accounted for roughly 4% of the active Cov19doms
websites. The detection categories of those detected by two
or more online scanners are summarized in Table IV. Note
that a website may be detected as a different category (e.g.,

In such cases, the category is decided by majority vote, and
if the category is not uniquely determined, the category is
marked as “pending”. It can be seen that once again, phishing
sites have the highest number of detections, but the number
of other malicious sites is also very close.
IV. D ISCUSSION
A. Limitations
This study aims to understand the Cov19doms in the wild.
In order to ensure the accuracy of the results, two heuristics
were applied to extract such domain names, as described in
Section II. The first heuristic was to limit the domain search
words to “covid” and “corona.” Such limitation will miss
several cases where domain names contain other keywords
such as “virus” or “mask,” which could bring false positives
as we discussed. We also limited our search to the e2LD
part; the limitation will eliminate the cases where an FQDN
contains the substrings in its hostname. Another heuristic was
to constrain the registration date for domain names.
Our analysis also excluded websites that did not include
keywords in their domain name but were COVID-19-related in
their website content. Such websites existed on both malicious
and benign sites. Another limitation that we are aware of is
that the URL path is not taken into account when creating
a URL from an FQDN. We only retrieved web content from
the top directory on a website in the web-crawling process.
Exploring the URL path might reduce the errors shown in the
Table II, however we may miss web content if a website does
not configure the setting of index file. Addressing these issues
is left for future study.
B. Detecting malicious Cov19doms
As we have shown in this work, simply using a list of
Cov19doms as a blocklist may result in false positives, and
this introduces the risk of blocking information that is useful
for COVID-19 countermeasures. In order to determine if a
detected Cov19dom is malicious, we need to monitor a domain
name when it is being abused and examine the content in a
timely manner. The Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH) is a
global database of trademarks and provides this information
to registries and registrars during the domain name registration
process to thwart unwanted domain name registrations by
third-parties. This is effectively used by trademark owners
to fight against a trademark infringement using fake domain
names. Unfortunately, this countermeasure is not effective

against domain names piggybacking on global crises including
COVID-19, due to the fact that there is no right owner of
such corresponding keywords. Szurdi and Christin proposed
the anti-bulk registration policy such as dynamic pricing to
make bulk domain registrations expensive [19], which is a
potential countermeasure against bulk-registered COVID-19
domain names.
C. Ethical considerations
Our study analyzed publicly available DNS records and web
content corresponding to the domain names without collecting
personally-identifiable information. In our web-crawling process, we sent the minimum amount of legitimate requests to
websites, i.e., two requests (HTTP and HTTPS) per site, and
left them and their users unharmed.
V. R ELATED W ORK
In this section, we present several related works and clarify
how our work differs.
Internet Measurement driven by COVID-19. Favale et
al. [8] analyzed the impact of the lockdown enforcement
on a campus network in Italy. Through analyzing Internet
traffic statistics, they revealed that while incoming traffic was
reduced by a factor of 10 during the lockdown, outgoing traffic
increased by 2.5 times, driven by more than 600 daily online
classes, with around 16,000 students per day. They concluded
that the campus network infrastructure is robust enough to
successfully cope with the drastic changes while maintaining
the university operations. Feldmann et al. [9] conducted similar
analysis using traffic data collected at one ISP, three IXPs, and
one educational network. They reported on changes in Internet
traffic in various perspectives and concluded that the Internet
infrastructure has been able to deliver the increased Internet
traffic without significant impact.
Candela et al. [4] conducted a large-scale analysis of Internet latencies, which could be affected by the increased amount
of online activities during the lockdown. By leveraging the
measurement data collected with the RIPE Atlas platform [17],
they analyzed Internet latencies focusing on Italy, where
people experienced more than a month of lockdown. They
reported that the increase in online activity led to an increase
in the variability of Internet latencies, a trend that intensified
in the evening due to the increase in the entertainment traffic.
Event-driven domain name registration. The strategy of
early acquisition of domain names associated with ongoing
events has been a well-known approach in the domain name
business community. In fact, a patent of such a technique was
filed by an Internet domain registrar [14]. Although eventdriven domain registration is a widely known best practice
in the domain name business community, to the best of our
knowledge, there has been little research on the topic in
the research community. One of the few available studies is
that Coull et al. [5] derived rules to describe topics, such as
ongoing events, from popular Google search queries with the
aim of characterizing the registration of speculative domain
names and empirically evaluated the feasibility of domain

acquisition based on such a method. While they attempted
to extract current events using Google search, COVID-19
is a unique phenomenon, and researchers have not had an
opportunity to study domain names for such a case.
Tombs et al. [21] tried to determine the level of credibility of a top-level coronavirus-related website that purport to be government websites, and find out the purpose
of non-governmental entity or company register a top-level
coronavirus-related domain name by analyzing data collected
from 303 websites which domains related to COVID-19 between April 5 and April 6, 2020. They found that 80% of websites presented as government websites cannot be verified the
authenticity. Additionally, about 30% of websites collected had
unverified information and nearly half were squatting domains
or “under construction." Government websites providing critical information about coronaviruses should not be subject
to ambiguous in their authenticity , and therefore should not
share the top-level domain name space with non-governmental
entity or company. Their findings are important in establishing
trusted communication channel between government and their
citizens during this crisis.
Malicious domain names and websites. Much research
has been conducted on ways to observe the registration and
early activity of malicious domain names [10], [12], [20].
Hao et al. [10] unveiled that DNS infrastructures and early
DNS lookup patterns for a newly registered malicious domain
name differ significantly from those with a legitimate domain
name. Korczynski et al. [12] collected WHOIS information,
web content, and DNS records for corresponding malicious
domain names provided from 11 distinct abuse feeds and
observed a growing number of spam domains in new gTLDs,
indicating a shift from legacy gTLDs to new gTLDs. We
conducted our measurement by referring to the ways practiced
in these existing studies. While these studies analyzed fake
domain names containing strings related to brand names
having specific owners, our study focuses on domain names
containing strings related to generic crisis having no specific
owners, which makes it be challenging to distinguish between
malicious and legitimate domain names.
There are few academic studies so far on detection of malicious domain names related to COVID-19. Ispahany and Islam
developed a machine learning model using lexical features
to detect malicious domain names and examined registered
domain names in April 2020 [11]. The purpose of our study
is not to detect malicious Cov19doms, but to investigate the
usage of Cov19doms. Furthermore, our study utilized a longterm dataset obtained from the end of December 2019 to the
end of September 2020.
VI. C ONCLUSION
Through the analysis of 167K of Cov19doms we collected,
we found that a month before the global COVID-19 pandemic
hit in April 2020, there was a flood of domain name registrations. This phenomenon can be attributed to a variety of
people registering domain names for the purpose of COVID19 countermeasures, speculative domain name business, or

to generate phishing sites, as they predicted the high impact
of COVID-19. Such a global, high-impact phenomenon is
unprecedented in the past and is a remarkable event from the
perspective of Internet measurement. In conventional measures
against the registration of unwanted domain names targeting brands, distinguishing between an original domain name
and a fake domain name has been relatively straightforward
since the brand owner has been determined. In the case of
the Cov19doms, on the other hand, there is no concept of
a brand owner, and many different players have registered
Cov19doms to benefit society. Therefore, it is not feasible
to apply traditional domain name analysis methods. As this
study revealed, majority of Cov19doms (about 60%) are not
active. Even if Cov19doms are uesd for active websites,
many of them are parked or hosted, and it is not clear
how these domain names will change in the future. Addressing these problems is a challenge for the future. We plan
to release our dataset and tools used for our analyses at
