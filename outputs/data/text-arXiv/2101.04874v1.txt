ABSTRACT
There is overwhelming evidence on SARS-CoV-2 Airborne Transmission (AT) in the ongoing
COVID-19 outbreak. It is extraordinarily difficult, however, to deduce a generalized
framework to assess the relative airborne transmission risk with respect to other modes. This
is due to the complex biophysics entailed in such phenomena. Since the SARS outbreak in
2002, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been one of the main tools scientists used to
investigate AT of respiratory viruses. Now, CFD simulations produce intuitive and physically
plausible colour-coded results that help scientists understand SARS-CoV-2 airborne
transmission patterns. In addition to validation requirements, for any CFD model to be of
epistemic value to the scientific community; it must be reproducible. In 2020, more than 45
published studies investigated SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission in different scenarios using
CFD. Here, I systematically review the published CFD studies of COVID-19 and discuss their
reproducibility criteria with respect to the CFD modeling process. Using a Weighted Scoring
Model (WSM), I propose a novel reproducibility index for CFD simulations of SARS-CoV-2
AT. The proposed index (0 ≤ 𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 ≤ 1) relies on three reproducibility criteria comprising 10
elements that represent the possibility of a CFD study (𝑗) to be reproduced. Frustratingly, only
3 of 23 studies (13%) achieved full reproducibility index (𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 ≥ 0.9) while the remaining
87% were found generally irreproducible(𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 < 0.9). Without reproducible models, the
scientific benefit of CFD simulations will remain hindered, fragmented and limited. In
conclusion, I call the scientific community to apply more rigorous measures on reporting and
publishing CFD simulations in COVID-19 research.

INTRODUCTION

To the date of writing this article, COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has resulted in 1.6
million deaths and a historic crash of financial markets[1] leading to major fractures in the
world economy[2]. This pandemic challenges our healthcare systems, economic models and
social lifestyle[3]. Many countries refuged to enforcing nationwide curfew[4], travel ban and
quarantine[5], social distancing and obligatory use of face masks[6] as measures to mitigate
the outbreak. Despite few earlier controversies[7, 8], now there is a widely accepted theory
among scientists now proposing that airborne transmission (AT) is a major infection scenario
of COVID-19[9-11]. Few days after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic[12], a
study[13] published in New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated the possibility of
SARS-CoV-2 AT experimentally. The study compared the stability of SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and on surfaces. It was evidently shown that SARS-CoV-2 has an
aerosol stability similar to SARS-CoV-1 and remains infectious in aerosols for hours. SARSCoV-2 infected patients were shown to exhibit high viral loads in the upper-respiratory
tract[14], manifesting the possibility of producing highly infectious aerosols even from
asymptomatic patients[15]. Infectious aerosols are often categorized according to the droplet
particle size. During a sneeze or a cough, aerosols of respiratory tract fluid are produced
containing large particles (i.e. droplets) typically greater than 5 µm in diameter. These particles
impact directly on a susceptible individual. On the other hand, a susceptible individual could
possibly inhale microscopic aerosol particles consisting of the residual solid components of
evaporated respiratory droplets, which are small enough (<5 µm) to remain airborne for
hours[16]. Even during speech, thousands of oral fluid droplets that constitute AT and COVID19 infection risk[17]. It was also established that infectious SARS-CoV-2 RNA is persistent in
aerosols collected in the vicinity of infected individuals with particles of small and large
sizes[18]. Jin et al[19] showed that SARS-CoV-2 positive air samples can be collected in ICU
room for four days after the residing patient tested negative. Guo et al[20] collected positive
samples from ICU air as far as 4 m from patients. Despite rapid air changing in airborne
infection isolation rooms (AIIRs), Chia et al[21] showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be
detected in air samples with particle sizes of > 4 𝜇𝑚 and 1 − 4 𝜇𝑚. Razzini et al[22]
confirmed the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples taken from ICU room and
corridor of a hospital in Milan, Italy. In highly populated communities and crowded spaces,
AT could lead to catastrophic rise in infection probability[23, 24]. Therefore, investigating AT
2

aerodynamics is of eminent importance to help mitigate infection risk at different scales and
scenarios[25]. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a very useful tool to manifest such
importance by providing rapid evaluation method to identify AT risk at virtually any given
scenario[26].

RELEVANCE OF CFD MODELS IN SARS-2002 OUTBREAK
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a diameter of 0.1 𝜇𝑚, aerosol half-life of 1
hour and a concentration of 104 − 1011 RNAs/mL in respiratory fluids[27]. These are typical
numbers for the Coronaviridae[28], including SARS-CoV-1 that caused the first pandemic of
the 21st century. It has been established that viral RNA is carried in fluid particles produced
by symptomatic patients while coughing and breathing[29] leading to AT of the virus. The
degree to which AT constitutes infection risk depends on many variables that are yet to be
comprehensively understood. The pathogenic similarity between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARSCoV-2[30] establishes relevance between the role of AT in the two corresponding pandemics.
The studies conducted on the 2002 SARS outbreak in Amoy Gardens housing complex of Hong
Kong presented important insights. Yu et al[31] studied the distribution of the initial 187 cases
of SARS in Hong Kong while searching for a possible transmission pathway to justify that
cluster infection. Using logistic regression and CFD simulations, they showed that the infection
risk pattern corresponded well with the predicted aerosol transfer pattern between apartments.
In another study, Chu et al[32] analyzed the correlation between nasopharyngeal viral load of
SARS patients on hospital admission and their geographic/location distribution in Amoy
Gardens. They evidently concluded that AT played an important role in the Hong Kong
outbreak. Li et al[33] used multi-zone airflow modeling to study the infection risk of 300
patients in the same housing complex. By comparing the virus concentration and aerosol
dispersion predicted by their model and the distribution of infected patients in the housing
blocks, they provided another evidence on AT. Moreover, Booth et al [34] conducted PCR tests
on air samples collected from patient rooms during the Toronto outbreak. By detecting active
SARS-CoV-1 in air around patients, they indicated AT possibility experimentally. These
studies, all involving CFD simulations, showed that AT has played a significant role in SARS
pandemic outbreak. This historic experience provided sufficient reasoning to consider AT risk
of SARS-CoV-2 at the early beginning of COVID-19 outbreak.

PURPOSE, SCOPE AND REVIEW APPROACH
The purpose of this article is to promote better reporting practice of CFD studies related
to COVID-19 research and biomedical research at large. The scope is limited to the concept of
reproducibility in CFD practice. The establishment of any CFD study requires proper level of
verification, validation and reproducibility otherwise, it would not be possible to confirm the
study’s conclusion[35]. In COVID-19 air transmission research, CFD models represent the
interface between the biomedical and managerial aspects of the COVID-19 infection control
problem. The rapid, aggressive and mutating COVID-19 outbreak compels certain level of
diligence to support balanced and effective decision making strategies of infection control. The
scope of reproducibility here refers to the minimum level of details at which a CFD model
could be reproduced with a quantifiable measure of error or deviation.
Similar to SARS-CoV-1, the importance of CFD in investigating SARS-CoV-2 AT is
driven by its parametrization capability that identifies AT patterns of virtually any given
scenario. Each scenario reveals aerodynamic aspects specific to the settings, physical models
and validation data of the CFD simulation. To compile a comprehensive resource of COVID19 CFD studies and their reproducibility criteria, a systematic review of the CFD studies is
conducted and discussed. The search engine Scopus was used to identify the reviewed studies.
On December 23rd 2020, a search in TIT-ABS-KEY field yielded 49 studies with the search
string: TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "computational fluid dynamics" OR "CFD" ) AND TITLE-ABSKEY ( "Covid-19" OR "SARS-CoV-2" OR "Coronavirus" ) AND ( LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR
, 2021 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR , 2020 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR , 2019 ) ). The
studies were obtained, reviewed to identify the main corpus of this review. A total of 23 studies
were found to report formal and conclusive CFD results. The studies were then classified
according to transmission scenario, solver, computational model, physics, and settings of each
respective CFD model. The studies were classified into three sets. Set (A)[36-43] represents
the studies conducted on COVID-19 in healthcare facilities such as hospital wards and care
rooms. Set (B)[44-52] represents the studies conducted on SARS-CoV-2 AT in respiratory
scenarios such as in nasopharyngeal and pulmonary spaces. Finally, set (C)[53-58] represents
the studies conducted on COVID-19 in generic spaces and buildings.

METHOD: A REPRODUCIBILITY INDEX FOR CFD MODELS OF
COVID-19
There are three criteria of reproducibility that any fluid dynamicist with firsthand
experience in modern CFD software needs to address in order to replicate a simulation case[59,
60]. The first criterion deals with the numerical formulation of the model, the second one deals
with physical formulation and the third deals with the parametric framework of the simulation
being reproduced. The elements of each reproducibility level are detailed in table 1. In order to
evaluate the 23 CFD studies, a novel reproducibility index is proposed. The index is developed
based on the weighted scoring model (WSM) commonly used in engineering project
management. The importance of each element relevant to COVID-19 research is assigned a
numerical weight 𝑤 = [5,10, 20] representing low, medium and high importance to the
reproducibility process, respectively. Each element in each study is assigned a binary score 𝑠 =
[0,1] to represent the reproducibility of each element. Then, the CFD reproducibility index is
calculated as:
𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 =

∑𝑛
𝑖=1 𝑤𝑖 𝑆𝑖

(1)

∑𝑛
𝑖=1 𝑤𝑖

where 𝑗 is the study index and 𝑛 is the number of reproducibility elements, respectively.
Equation (1) dictates that 0 ≤ 𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 ≤ 1 where values at 0 and 1 represent entirely
irreproducible and reproducible simulations, respectively. The elements relevant to COVID19 research and the scope of this study and their corresponding weights are detailed in table
(2). The reasoning proposed for the weights of reproducibility elements is intuitive and derived
from the CFD modeling process. Two elements of high weight (𝑤𝑖 = 20) represent the
mandatory information required for the setup of the CFD simulation which are the model
dimensions and initial and boundary conditions (40% of the total weight per study). Five
elements with medium weight (𝑤𝑖 = 10) represent the information that would make
reproducibility possible (50% of the total weight per study). Two elements of low weight (𝑤𝑖 =
5) represent the information that would make the reproducibility process easy (10% of the total
weight per study). Here, we argue that for a study to be reproducible𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 ≥ 0.9. Irreproducible
studies have𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 ≤ 0.4 while studies with 0.4 < 𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 < 0.9 are difficult to reproduce as they
lack information necessary to perform CFD simulation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The distribution of 𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 among the 23 studies comprising sets A, B and C are
graphically presented in figure 2. The detailed calculations and scoring sheet is provided in the
supplementary materials. The mean value of 𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 was 0.62, 0.57 and 0.71 for sets A, B and
C, respectively. The values of 𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 of the 23 studies were found to be normally distributed
around mean (mean=0.62) as shown in figure 3. The distribution, however, is slightly skewed
for 𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 < 0.62. Three studies, one from each set[42, 46, 57], achieved full reproducibility
score (𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 ≥ 0.9) while six studies[40, 41, 44, 47, 52, 53] were found to be irreproducible
(𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 ≤ 0.4). The remaining 14 studies were found to have a reproducibility score in the range
of 0.4 < 𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 < 0.9. These studies are difficult to reproduce as they lack important
information. The difficulty of reproducing these studies varies according to the missing
information. Figure 4 shows the missing and available information in the 14 studies according
to the elements presented in table 2. Missing information about Reynolds number and aerosol
particle diameter characterize 79% and 36% of these studies, respectively. Missing dimensions
and validation information characterize 50% of such studies while the remaining
reproducibility elements vary from one study to the other.
Infection control in healthcare facilities is of crucial importance in managing COVID19 outbreak. Set (A) [36-43] comprises CFD studies of different AT scenarios in hospitals and
healthcare facilities. The computational domain in these studies always represent the air flow
around aerosol source of particular settings that represent SARS-CoV-2 AT. Grid resolution
ranged from 0.9 × 106 in simple two-dimensional representation of generic care room[38] to
50 × 106 cells in three-dimensional representations in prefabricated inpatient ward[42]. The
use of RANS models was the main approach to model turbulence with just two studies were
reported using LES[38, 39]. Aerosol modeling was predominantly conducted using the
Eulerian-Lagrangian approach[61]. Only one study reported the Reynolds number value[38]
and another reported aerosol particle density[36] of the simulation. Four studies[36, 41-43]
reported the aerosol particle size in the simulations with a range from 0.69 to 500𝜇𝑚. Relatively
similar approaches were identified in the studies comprising set (C)[53-58] where SARS-CoV2 AT was studied in generic building spaces. On the other hand, the respiratory studies
comprised in set (B)[44-52] had some different CFD approaches. The computational domain
in such studies represented either expiratory space[44, 46, 50] (i.e. space around person’s head)
8

or inspiratory space[45, 51] (i.e. tracheobronchial or nasopharyngeal space). Grid resolution,
therefore, had a wide range from 0.15 × 106 to 650 × 106 cells[46, 49]. The aerosol particle
diameter in set (C) studies[44, 45] ranged from 0.1 to 525 𝜇𝑚. Turbulence and aerosol models
were dominated by RANS and Eulerian-Lagrangian approaches similarly with sets (A) and
(C). These CFD studies should empower our understanding of COVID-19 outbreak[7, 26, 62,
63]. This is demonstrated by the citation data of these studies, as presented earlier in this article.
However, and unlike other important testing and characterization tools addressing this
unprecedented pandemic, published CFD studies suffer from a lack of sufficient reproducibility
criteria to advance infectious aerosol research. With more than half of the studies missing
information about domain dimensions, Reynolds number, particle density and validation; a
reproducibility crisis is identified and should be addressed. It is noteworthy to mention that
none of the studies included in this review has provided any form or format of digital files to
enable manipulation and processing of the CFD results.

CONCLUSION
A novel reproducibility index (𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 )is proposed to measure the possibility of a CFD study to
be reproduced. The index accounts for three criteria comprising a total of 10 elements that
comprise the essential information required for reproducing CFD simulation. When the index
was applied to 23 published CFD studies related to COVID-19, it revealed a reproducibility
crisis. The results were normally distributed around a mean value of 0.62 and revealed that
only 13% of the selected studies achieve the reproducibility criteria(𝑅𝑗𝐶𝐹𝐷 ≥ 0.9). In
conclusion, we propose this novel reproducibility index as a criteria for publishing CFD studies
related to COVID-19 research in order to empower reproducibility and validation in this
important research topic.
