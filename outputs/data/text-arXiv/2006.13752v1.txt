Abstract
We discuss the generation of various reproduction ratios or numbers that
are very useful to monitor an ongoing epidemic like Covid-19 and examine the
effects of intervention measures. A detailed SEIR algorithm is described for
their computation, with applications given to the current Covid-19 outbreaks
in a number of countries (Argentina, Brazil, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, UK
and USA). The corresponding matlab script, complete and ready to use, is
provided for free downloading.

Key words: Covid-19 outbreak, SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus, reproduction numbers,
SEIR deterministic models, parameter uncertainties, robust methods

1. Introduction
The monitoring of the evolving state of a serious epidemic can be done during
and after its outbreak by estimating the daily values of basic ratios generally known
as reproductive or reproduction numbers [5, 6, 7, 13]. While not properly geared to
allow serious predictions of future values of the epidemic, they are nevertheless able
to display the past and present history with amazing clarity. However, as their calculation depends on the values of various mathematical parameters (like the length of
transmission and incubation periods), this ability may be impaired by inaccuracies
in their estimation. This is particularly true for the widely used basic reproduction
number, which measures the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual in a full susceptible population (Figure 1).

On the other hand, once some mathematical model has been chosen to simulate
the disease dynamics and its parameters determined, several alternative reproductive numbers become automatically available at no additional computational cost,
many showing very little dependence on key parameters like transmission or incubation times. We will illustrate this fact in the context of deterministic SEIR models,
but our approach can be adapted to other mathematical models (deterministic or
stochastic) as well.
The idea is most easily explained by considering the simplest SEIR model of all,
defined by the equations (1.1) below. This model divides the entire population in
question into four classes: the susceptible individuals (class S), those exposed (class E,
formed by infected people who are still inactive (i.e., not yet transmitting the disease), the active infected or infectious individuals (class I) and the removed ones.
The latter class is formed by those who have recovered from the disease (class R) or
who have died from it (class D). The dynamics between the various classes is given
in the universal language of calculus by the differential equations

see e.g. [2, 4, 7, 12] for a detailed discussion of the various terms and their meanings.
The parameters β (average transmission rate) and r (average lethality rate
of the population I due to the disease) vary with t (time, here measured in days),
but δ and γ are typically positive constants given by
γ =

1
Tt

,

δ =

1
Ti

,

(1.2)

where T t denotes the average transmission period and T i stands for the mean
incubation time, which will be taken as 14 and 5.2, respectively [9, 10, 14]). In the
system (1.1), N denotes the full size of the susceptible population initially exposed,
so that we have S(t0 ) + E(t0 ) + I(t0 ) +R(t0 ) + D(t0 ) = N, where t0 denotes the
initial time. Observing that, by the equations (1.1), the sum S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t)
+D(t) is invariant, it follows the conservation law
S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) + D(t) = N,

∀ t > t0 ,

(1.3)

since, for simplicity, the model neglects any changes in the population due to birth,
migration or death by other causes during the period of the epidemic (of the order of
a few months). To well define the model (1.1), besides informing the functions β(t)
and r(t) we need to provide the initial values S(t0 ), E(t0 ), I(t0 ), R(t0 ), D(t0 ), which
is not a trivial task, since not all of these variables are reported, and those reported
may be in error — which may well be large in case of significant underreporting.
It thus seems clear that predicting reasonably right values for the variables S(t),
E(t), I(t), R(t) and D(t) at future times is not a simple problem, especially in the
long time range. The situation becomes even more complicated for more complex
(i.e., stratified) models, which add other variables and parameters to be determined.
Calibrating many parameters can quickly become a nightmare. For all its simplicity,
models with few variables and parameters like (1.1) can yield surprisingly good
results and thus should not be overlooked, as will be seen in the sequel.

2. Implementing the SEIR model
Having introduced the SEIR equations (1.1), we now describe an implementation
of this model that is suitable for the computation of reproduction numbers.
(i ) assigning a value to the population parameter N
In the case of Covid-19, which can be considered a new virus (SARS-CoV-2), it has
been common to assume the entire population susceptible and assign its whole value
to N. This is highly debatable, since this parameter refers to that particular fraction
of the susceptible population that is effectively subject to infection. For deterministic models, this introduces the possibility that an outbreak might not happen after
the introduction or reintroduction of a few infected individuals, as it has been long
recognized in the stochastic literature [1, 9]. In any case, it turns out that N is not
so much important for the short range dynamics as it proves to be in the long run
(see Figures 2a and 2b), so that for our present purposes this is not a serious issue.
We have therefore taken for N the full population of the region under consideration.

and N = 50 million (black curve). Note the very close similarity of the two 30D
predictions in spite of the appreciable difference in the values of N. Points shown
in blue are the official values reported (cf.https://covid.saude.gov.br.)

(ii ) generation of initial data S(t0 ), E(t0 ), I(t0 ), R(t0 ), D(t0 )
Initial values S0 , E0 , I0 , R0 , D0 for the five variables are generated from a starting
date ts on, which is taken so as to meet some minimum value chosen of total reported
cases (typically, 100). Denoting by Cr (t) the total amount of reported cases up to
some time t, and letting EIR(t) be the sum of the populations E(t), I(t) and R(t),
we set
EIR(ts ) = fc · (Cr (ts ) − D(ts )),

(2.1)

where fc ≥ 1 denotes a correction factor to account for likely underreportings on
the official numbers given. (In (2.1), we have neglected possible underreportings on
the number of deaths, which could of course be similarly accounted for if desired.)
Again, this factor will not play an important role in this paper and could be safely
ignored, but it should be carefully considered in the case of long time predictions.
Having estimated EIR(ts ), we then set
E(ts ) = E0 (ts ) := a · (1 − b) · EIR(ts ),

(2.2a)

I(ts ) = I0 (ts ) := (1 − a) · (1 − b) · EIR(ts ),

(2.2b)

4

R(ts ) = R0 (ts ) := b · EIR(ts ),

(2.2c)


S(ts ) = S0 (ts ) := N − E(ts ) + I(ts ) + R(ts ) + D(ts ) ,

(2.2d)

where a = T i /(T i + T t ) and b = 0.30, consistently with the literature (see e.g. [14]).
The arbitrariness in this choice of weights gets eventually corrected as we compute
more values S0 (t0 ), E0 (t0 ), I0 (t0 ), R0 (t0 ), D0 (t0 ) at later initial times t0 = ts + 1,..., tF ,
where tF stands for the final (i.e., most recent) date of reported data available. For
each t0 , the solution of the equations (1.1) with the previously obtained initial data
at t0 − 1 is computed on the interval J(t0 ) = [ t0 − 1, t1 ], t1 = min { t0 − 1 + d0 , tF },
with constant parameters β = β0 (t0 − 1), r = r0 (t0 − 1) determined so that the computed values for Cr (t), D(t) best fit the reported data for these variables on [ t0 , t1 ] in
the sense of least squares [12]. (Here, d0 ∈ [ 2, 10 ] is chosen according to the data
regularity.) Once this solution (S, E, I, R, D)(t) is obtained, we set S0 (t0 ) := S(t0 ),
E0 (t0 ) := E(t0 ), I0 (t0 ) := I(t0 ), R0 (t0 ) := R(t0 ), D0 (t0 ) := D(t0 ) and move on to the
next time level t0 + 1, repeating the procedure until tF is reached.
(iii ) computing the solution on some final interval [ t0 , T ] (prediction phase)
Having completed the previous steps, we can address the possibility of prediction.
Although this is not important for our present goals, it is included for completeness.
Choosing an initial time t0 ∈ (ts , tF ], we then take the initial values
S(t0 ) = S0 (t0 ), E(t0 ) = E0 (t0 ), I(t0 ) = I0 (t0 ), R(t0 ) = R0 (t0 ), D(t0 ) = D0 (t0 ).
In order to predict the values of the variables S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t), D(t) for t > t0 ,
it is important to have good estimates for the evolution of the key parameters β(t)
and r(t) beyond t0 . This is the most computationally intensive part of the algorithm
and is better executed in large computers. Such estimates can be given in the form
β(t) = β0 + aβ e− λβ (t − t0 )

(2.3a)

r(t) = r0 + ar e− λr (t − t0 )

(2.3b)

where β0 , aβ , λβ , r0 , ar , λr ∈ R are determined so as to minimize the maximum size
of weighted relative errors in the computed values for Cr (t), D(t) as compared
to the official data reported for these variables on some previous interval [ t0 − τ0 , t0 ]
(weighted Chebycheff problem) for some chosen τ0 > 0 (usually, 20 ≤ τ0 ≤ 30).
This problem is solved iteratively starting with an initial guess obtained from the
analysis of the previous values β0 (t), r0 (t) computed in the step (ii ) above. The result
is illustrated in Figure 3 for the case of β(t), with similar considerations for r(t).

= 70 (05/05/2020) for the outbreak of Covid-19 in Brazil, assuming the basic form (2.3a),
after solving the Chebycheff problem (red curve). The data points in the interval [ 40, 70 ],
shown here in blue, are values of the function β0 (t) computed in step (ii), which are used
to obtain the first approximation to β(t). Values of β0 (t) previous to t = 40 (04/05/2020),
shown in black, are disregarded. The golden points beyond t0 = 70 are future values of β0 (t),
not available on 05/05/2020, displayed to allow comparison with the predicted values β(t).

Once β(t), r(t) have been obtained, the equations (1.1) are finally solved (Figure 4).

3. Reproduction numbers
A natural by-product of the results generated by the algorithm is the estimate of
reproduction numbers of the epidemic, which measure the intensity of transmission
at various times and, in doing so, are useful indicators to monitor the situation and
the effects of intervention procedures that may have been taken. Using the generic
symbol Rt to denote such quantities,1 they signal a rise in the number of infections
in the case Rt > 1, their decrease when Rt < 1, and temporary steadiness if Rt = 1.
For instance, rewriting the equation for the critical population I(t) in the form
dI
= α(t) I(t),
dt

α(t) := δ · E(t)/I(t) − r(t) − γ,

(3.1a)

we see that I(t) will increase if α(t) > 0, decrease when α(t) < 0 and stay about
the same if α(t) = 0 — or, in terms of the ratio
Rt :=

δ · E(t)/I(t)
,
r(t) + γ

(3.1b)

whether we have Rt > 1, Rt < 1 or Rt = 1, respectively. Another natural possibility
would be to consider basic ratios like
Rt :=

I(t + d)
,
I(t − d)

Rt :=

E(t + d) + I(t + d)
E(t − d) + I(t − d)

(3.2)

for some chosen d > 0. For example, the choice d = T t /2 corresponds to the standard
basic reproduction number, or the mean number of secondary infections caused by a
typical infected individual during his transmission period [9, 12]. The corresponding
expressions would be, using the calculations performed in step (ii ) of the algorithm,
(1)

Rt :=

δ · E0 (t)/I0 (t)
,
r0 (t) + γ

(3.3)

where r0 (t) denotes the lethality rates computed there, or else
(2)

Rt :=

I0 (t + 3)
,
I0 (t − 3)

(3)

Rt :=

E0 (t + 3) + I0 (t + 3)
,
E0 (t − 3) + I0 (t − 3)

(3.4)
(1)

and so forth. These indicators point to similar scenarios (Figura 5), with Rt seem(2)
ingly more influenced by seasonal (weekly) variations in the data. We have found Rt
particularly useful, with numerical results that are consistent with previous analyses
1

The notation Rt is natural in stochastic models, and is adopted here as we have already used
R(t), R0 (t) with other meanings (size of the recovered population and their initial values, resp.).

7

(see e.g. [13]). For time scales such as those of Covid-19, the choice d = 3 is good to
zoom in the scenario and facilitate the reading (Figure 6), while not compromising
robustness (Figure 7).

4. Applications
In this section we will illustrate the use of reproduction values by examining the
evolution of Covid-19 in various countries around the world under the view of such
(2)
numbers — choosing for definiteness the numeric ratio Rt defined in (3.4) above
as our basic indicator, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, we set
Rt =

I0 (t + 3)
I0 (t − 3)

(4.1)

where I0 (s) is the size of the active infected population at time s as computed in
the step (ii ) of the SEIR algorithm (see Section 2).
Taking right decisions about intervention or relaxation measures is a very difficult
and complex process that involves a careful consideration of various mathematical
indicators and a lot of other factors including many health, economic and social
issues. In the following examples we consider only the single factor given by reproduction numbers. For all the simplicity and obvious limitations of this approach, it
offers nevertheless precious insight and information about the disease dynamics and
evolution.

was based on data available for each country at the site worldometers/coronavirus.

procedures. Partial relaxation of some of these measures was introduced on 06/01/2020
(t = 75) and, in this new period, Rt has remained relatively stable at 1.30 (yellow band).

Bringing the epidemic to a state of nationwide control (Rt < 1) still seems far away.
This example illustrates the basic fact that having low numbers of infections and
deaths does not necessarily mean having the epidemic under control.

negative factor is that flexibilization of control measures has been introduced before the

various regions had attained a state of epidemic control (Rt < 1), which is not ideal.

Despite successfully bringing the epidemic under control, the number of reported cases and deaths was very high due to the
initial delay in taking intervention action.
