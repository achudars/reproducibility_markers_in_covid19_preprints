Abstract. Non-perturbative scale-dependent renormalization problems are ubiquitous in lattice QCD as
they enter many relevant phenomenological applications. They require solving non-perturbatively the renormalization group equations for the QCD parameters and matrix elements of interest in order to relate their
non-perturbative determinations at low energy to their high-energy counterparts needed for phenomenology. Bridging the large energy separation between the hadronic and perturbative regimes of QCD, however,
is a notoriously difficult task. In this contribution, we critically address the challenges that state-of-theart lattice determinations of the QCD parameters have to face in order to be significantly improved. In
addition, we review a novel strategy that has been recently put forward in order to solve this class of nonperturbative renormalization problems, and discuss its implications for future precision determinations.
The new ideas exploit the decoupling of heavy quarks to match Nf -flavor QCD and the pure Yang-Mills
theory. Through this matching the computation of non-perturbative renormalization group runnings in
QCD can be shifted to the computationally much easier to solve pure-gauge theory. We shall present
results for the determination of the Λ-parameter of Nf = 3-flavor QCD where this strategy has been applied and proven successful. The results demonstrate that these techniques have the potential to unlock
unprecedented precision determinations of the QCD parameters from the lattice.

1 Introduction
Renormalization is a fundamental step in order to extract
(meaningful) phenomenologically relevant results from lattice QCD calculations. For the lattice theorist it is natural to renormalize the bare parameters of the lattice
QCD Lagrangian and the composite operators of interest
in terms of some hadronic renormalization schemes (see
e.g. ref. [1]). In order to make the determinations accessible to phenomenologists, however, it is often necessary
to translate the results obtained in the chosen hadronic
schemes to results in the (perturbative) schemes and at the
scales commonly considered in phenomenology. In practice
this requires the determination of the non-perturbative
renormalization group (RG) running of the renormalized
QCD parameters and operators from the hadronic scales
where they were originally defined, up to some high-energy
scale, where perturbation theory eventually applies.
Over the last decade or so, lattice QCD has entered
a precision era for an increasingly large set of quantities
(cf. ref. [2]). Renormalization is a relevant part of many of
these computations where it can significantly impact the
quality of the final results. Hence, as we are forced to be-

come more aware of all possible sources of uncertainties in
the determination of the bare lattice quantities, the same
care must be reserved to their renormalization. In particular, as any other lattice calculation, besides the statistical errors the determinations of renormalized parameters and operators have their systematics to deal with, i.e.
discretization effects, finite-volume effects, quark-mass effects, and, when a matching to phenomenological schemes
is necessary, also perturbative uncertainties. It is therefore
important that the development in strategies to compute
(bare) lattice quantities is accompanied with new ideas to
improve their renormalization, so to guarantee a precise
and robust end result.
An extreme example of this situation, if we can call it
this way, is the determination of the QCD parameters,
on which we shall focus. In this case we can say that
the problem is entirely a renormalization problem, which,
however, has very important phenomenological applications. On the lattice, the QCD coupling and quark masses
are renormalized in terms of hadronic masses and decay
constants, while in phenomenology the QCD parameters
are needed at energies of the order of a hundred GeV and
above. One would thus think that lattice QCD is not the

2

right tool for providing this information given the very
high energies involved. It appears more natural indeed to
obtain these parameters directly from high-energy quantities, rather than from the hadronic spectrum. As we shall
recall later in this contribution, this is actually not the
case, as lattice techniques offer an ideal framework for
these computations.
For the last 10-15 years, lattice QCD has consistently
delivered some of the most precise determinations for the
QCD parameters, as in particular for the QCD coupling
αs (see e.g. refs. [2, 3, 4]).1 The current world average for
the QCD coupling evaluated for reference at the Z-boson
pole mass MZ is αs (MZ ) = 0.1179(10) [4], and has a precision of about 0.8%. The lattice determinations alone give
αs (MZ ) = 0.1182(8) [2], and are the most precise subcategory of those considered by the PDG. Besides the high
precision of the individual state-of-the-art determinations,
it is important to emphasize also their overall consistency.
This is a rather non-trivial result considering the fact that
even though all lattice determinations share some common
systematics, these are probed quite differently by considering very different strategies [2]. It is fair to say that such
a variety of approaches within a PDG subcategory is in
fact unique [4].
Despite the tremendous efforts on and off the lattice,
however, the current uncertainty on αs is still large. It
is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in several key
processes, particularly so within the Higgs sector, and it
is expected to be a limiting factor in many high-precision
studies at future colliders (see e.g. refs. [5, 3]). An uncertainty on αs (MZ ) comfortably below the percent level is
desired for precision applications. For these reasons, there
are plans for future phenomenological determinations of
αs (MZ ) aiming at reaching the extremely competitive accuracy of 0.2% using high-luminosity high-energy data
(see e.g. refs. [6, 7, 8]). The lattice community needs to
meet the challenge.
Reducing the current uncertainties on lattice determinations of αs by such an important factor is not easy. Similarly to several phenomenological determinations most lattice determinations of αs are currently limited by systematic uncertainties related to the use of perturbation theory
at relatively low scales [2]. The issue is due to the fact that
reaching high energy on the lattice requires small lattice
spacings to be simulated and this is in general difficult
without a dedicated strategy.
A way around this has been known since a long time
and it is based on the concepts of finite-volume renormalization schemes and finite-size scaling (or step-scaling)
techniques [9, 10]. The methods have been recently applied
for obtaining one of the most precise determinations of
αs [11]. The key feature of the approach is that it allows
for reaching high energy with all systematics under con1

the ease of notation we often omit to write explicitly the µdependence of the coupling.

trol. This puts the lattice determinations in the privileged
position of being able to reach in a clean and controlled
way high energies fully non-perturbatively. The systematics due to the application of perturbation theory, in
particular, can be entirely avoided at the expenses of the
statistical errors accumulated in running from low up to
high-enough energy. The net advantage of this situation is
that differently from systematic uncertainties, statistical
errors can be straightforwardly reduced. Nonetheless, a
reduction of the current uncertainties on αs by an important factor is yet a computationally expensive task, even
employing a step-scaling strategy (cf. ref. [11]).
In this contribution we want to review the recent proposal made in ref. [12] which may allow for such error
reduction in a substantially cheaper way. The key feature
of this proposal is that one can replace the computation
of the RG running of the coupling in Nf -flavor QCD with
that in the pure-gauge theory. It is clear that, regardless
of the chosen strategy, this allows for a substantial simplification of the problem.
In short, the idea is built on three main steps and exploits the decoupling of heavy quarks in a couple of ways.
In the first step, heavy-quark decoupling is used to connect
a low-energy scale µdec in Nf -flavor QCD with the corresponding scale in the pure-gauge theory. This is achieved
through the computation of a massive renormalized coupling in an (unphysical) theory with Nf heavy quarks of
mass M  µdec . In a second step, by computing the
non-perturbative RG running in the pure Yang-Mills theory of a convenient coupling one obtains the pure-gauge
(N =0)
Λ-parameter in units of µdec , i.e. ΛMSf /µdec . Finally,
perturbative decoupling relations are invoked at a scale
µ ≈ M to estimate the ratio of Λ-parameters in the Nf (N )
(N =0)
flavor and pure Yang-Mills theory, that is, ΛMSf /ΛMSf .
(N )

Putting these steps together, one obtains ΛMSf /µdec , and
(N )

given the physical value of µdec finds ΛMSf . Consider(N )

ing Nf = 3 or 4, once ΛMSf is determined one proceeds
as usual and applies perturbative decoupling relations at
the charm and/or bottom quark-mass scale to estimate
(N =5)
ΛMSf
and from it αs (MZ ).
The strategy has already been proven successful in
(N =3)
the determination of ΛMSf
[12]. The ideas presented in
this reference are however general and may be applied to
solve other non-perturbative scale-dependent renormalization problems that face analogous challenges.
The outline of this contribution is the following.
We begin in Sect. 2 by recalling the challenges in solving scale-dependent renormalization problems on the lattice. The emphasis will be on the determination of the
QCD coupling. Besides introducing important concepts
for later sections, the presentation gives us the opportunity to discuss some recent interesting determinations.
These clearly illustrate the difficulties that state-of-the-art
computations of the coupling have to face in order to be
significantly improved.
In Sect. 3, we introduce the theory of heavy-quark decoupling and present the results of several recent studies

Mattia Dalla Brida: Past, present, and future of precision determinations of the QCD parameters from lattice QCD

that systematically assessed the size of non-perturbative
effects induced by heavy quarks. More precisely, the accuracy of using perturbative decoupling relations to match
the Λ-parameters of different Nf -flavor theories is investigated, as well as the corrections due to the heavy quarks
in low-energy quantities. These studies not only set the
foundation for the renormalization strategy based on decoupling, but also establish the precision at which αs can
be obtained from results in Nf = 3 QCD.
In Sect. 4, the application of heavy-quark decoupling
to the determination of the Nf -flavor QCD coupling is
(N =3)
described in detail and the results of ref. [12] for ΛMSf
are presented.
We conclude in Sect. 5 with some comments on the
future prospects for αs determinations in view of this new
strategy.

2 Precision determinations: the case of αs
Before presenting the renormalization ideas based on decoupling, we believe it is important to put these into context. The aim of these strategies, in fact, is not simply that
of providing alternative ways to solve non-perturbative
scale-dependent renormalization problems. The goal is to
develop a framework that will allow us to improve significantly our control over the current most relevant uncertainties. In this section, we thus want to recall what the
main challenges are in solving this class of problems and
which are the common approaches that are used to tackle
them. Many of the concepts and observations that will
be presented are for the most part well known. However,
these issues are now more current than ever given the high
precision that lattice QCD calculations have achieved, in
particular in the determination of the QCD parameters.
For this reason, we think it is important to address them
also here. This gives us the opportunity to discuss some
new insight that has been gathered from several recent
high-precision studies, as well as introducing key concepts
for later sections.
As anticipated, the discussion will focus on the case of
the QCD coupling αs . This allow us to analyze in easier
terms the main challenges that we need to face in highprecision non-perturbative determinations of RG runnings
while capturing all the relevant issues. Moreover, lattice
determinations of the strong coupling are a distinct case
of competitive calculations which have the potential to
deliver unprecedentedly precise results for a very relevant
and fundamental quantity. Making a significant progress
over the present state-of-the-art determinations by mere
brute force, however, is extremely demanding from the
computational point of view. It is therefore mandatory to
develop new strategies with the clear scope of improving
our control on all sources of uncertainty.
2.1 Determinations of αs on and off the lattice
As already mentioned, since more than a decade lattice
QCD is providing the Particle Physics community with

3

the most accurate determinations of αs (see refs. [2, 3, 4]).
The reason behind this is that, as we shall recall, lattice determinations have some important advantages over
their phenomenological counterparts (see e.g. refs. [13, 5]
for some reviews).
Any determination of αs , whether on the lattice or
not, relies on the following basic strategy. One considers a short-distance observable O(q) which depends on
a characteristic energy scale q. In the limit where q → ∞,
this observable is compared with its theoretical prediction,
Oth (q), in terms of a perturbative expansion2

(1)
The functions kn (s) appearing in this equation are the
coefficient functions defining the perturbative series. They
are known up to some order N and depend on the scale
factor, s > 0, that relates the renormalization scale µ at
which αs is extracted with the scale q. The basic difference
between phenomenological and lattice determinations of
αs is the choice of the observable O(q).
Requiring Oth (q) = O(q) for some finite q, clearly fixes
the value of αs (µ) only up to some error. This error comes
from several different sources, many of which are common
to all types of determinations. First of all, there is the
precision δO(q) to which the observable O(q) is known.
This of course depends on the relevant statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with the determination
of O(q). Secondly, there is the effect of the truncation
of the perturbative series to a given order, i.e. the size
of the O(αsN +1 ) terms in eq. (1). In addition to these
there are contaminations from “non-perturbative contributions”. These are represented in eq. (1) by power corrections to the perturbative expansion of O(Λp /q p ), where
p > 0 and Λ is some characteristic non-perturbative scale
of QCD.3 Thus, regardless of the chosen strategy, an accurate determination of αs needs to have, at least, these
general sources of error under control. Note that for the
most part these are systematic in nature.
Lattice determinations of αs are in principle favored in
several ways in succeeding at this task. Firstly, on the lattice the QCD parameters are first renormalized in terms of
some precisely measured hadronic quantities (e.g. hadron
masses, decay constants, etc.), for which experimental uncertainties typically contribute only marginally to the end

Note that in general the coupling αs to be considered here
should be the QCD coupling of the relevant Nf -flavor theory,
(N )
(5)
i.e. αs (µ) ≡ αMSf (µ), from which αMS (MZ ) can eventually be
extracted (cf. e.g. ref. [2] and Sect. 3.1.2). At this stage, however, we prefer to keep the discussion simple. We shall return
to this point later in detail.
3
Our knowledge of the form of non-perturbative effects is in
fact rather limited. In addition, strictly speaking, perturbative
and non-perturbative contributions cannot really be separated
due to the asymptotic nature of the series (see e.g. ref. [14]).
However, as the discussion is at this point qualitative we simply
adopt the simplistic representation of non-perturbative effects
as power corrections to the perturbative expansion.

result. Once these are fixed, one has lots of freedom in
choosing an observable O(q) as the getaway to extract
αs . One can therefore devise convenient observables which
have small statistical and systematic uncertainties; in particular there is no need for these quantities to be accessible in experiments. Phenomenological determinations of
αs , instead, rely on experimental data for the observable
O(q). It is the typical situation that when q becomes large,
and therefore many sources of systematic uncertainty in
eq. (1) become small, the experimental errors δO(q) become large. It is thus difficult to find in general a single
experimental quantity O(q) that allows one to accurately
follow its scale dependence over a wide range of q-values.
On the lattice, on the other hand, if carefully chosen, O(q)
can be computed precisely from low- up to very highenergy scales. This gives a unique handle on controlling
non-perturbative corrections and the contribution of the
missing perturbative orders in eq. (1).
Another advantage for the lattice theorist is that O is
defined within QCD alone. Consequently, the theoretical
description Oth of eq. (1) does not need to include contributions besides those from QCD. In addition, no modeling
of hadronization is needed when comparing the observable O with its perturbative prediction Oth . Different is
again the situation for phenomenological determinations.
In these cases, other Standard Model (SM) contributions
may be needed in order to extract αs and some modeling
of hadronization is necessary. Depending on the process,
these are known only up to some accuracy and typically
depend on the value of other SM parameters as well. The
precision one can aim for αs can therefore be limited by
these factors.4 Of course, lattice QCD determinations are
not entirely exempted from this issue. In this case, however, the problem of disentangling the QCD contributions
from “the rest” is confined to the hadronic quantities entering the renormalization of the theory, rather than to the
observable O itself. As mentioned earlier, the uncertainties on the hadronic quantities have, at present, limited
impact on the results for αs .
All current lattice QCD determinations of αs , on the
other hand, have to deal with the fact that their calculations are performed with an unphysical number of quark
flavors. The bottom and typically also the charm quark
are in fact not included in the simulations. This brings
up the issue of having to account for their missing contributions. We shall leave this very important discussion
aside for the moment and come back to it in detail in the
following (see Sect. 3).

2.2 The challenge of reaching high energy
Having for the most part presented the pros that lattice
determinations of αs in principle have, we now address
what the main difficulties are in practice.
4
Experimental observables are in principle sensitive also to
any New Physics. How this affects the extracted value of αs ,
however, is something hard to assess.

As any lattice QCD observable, besides the statistical uncertainties, O(q) is affected by several systematics
that need to be controlled. These include general ones,
i.e. discretization errors, finite-volume effects, an unphysical number of quarks, and quark-mass effects, as well
as others which depend on the specific choice of O and
set-up that we make (e.g. excited-state contaminations,
finite-temperature effects, Gribov copies, topology freezing, etc.). Finite quark-mass effects are typically not a
relevant issue in determinations of the QCD coupling [2].
As anticipated, we then leave the problem of having an
unphysical quark-content for later. We also ignore observable specific issues. Here we focus instead on discretization
and finite-volume effects. The combination of having the
two under control, in fact, can severely restrict the accessible range of q-values, if the renormalization strategy is
not carefully chosen.
In particular, if one is determined in resolving within
the same lattice simulation both the hadronic energy scales
relevant for the renormalization of the lattice theory, and
the energy scale q at which αs is extracted, then one is
necessarily limited by the simultaneous constraints:
L−1  Λ

and Λ  q  a−1 .

(2)

The first inequality expresses the fact that finite-volume
effects must be under control in hadronic quantities. The
infrared cutoff set by the finite extent L of the lattice
must be smaller than the typical non-perturbative scales of
QCD, denoted here by Λ. The second inequality, instead,
encodes two separate requirements. On the one hand, the
scale q must be much lower than the ultraviolet cutoff set
by the lattice spacing a. In this way, discretization errors
in O(q) are kept under control, and O(q) can be obtained
in the continuum limit with controlled errors.5 On the
other hand, q needs to be much larger than the scales Λ.
Only in this situation perturbation theory can reliably be
applied to extract αs by comparing O(q) with eq. (1).
The typical lattices that are simulated today have sizes
L/a . 100. Taking for definiteness mπ L = 4, with mπ =
140 MeV, the first condition in eq. (2) implies that for
such ensembles q  a−1 ≈ 3.5 GeV. Of course this is a
crude estimate and somewhat higher energies might be
achieved by compromising at different stages of the calculation (e.g. considering heavier pion masses or smaller
volumes in order to reach smaller values of a, or taking
aq . 1). Nonetheless, it is clear that although convenient in practice, considering lattices devised for studying hadronic physics to compute short-distance quantities
necessarily poses severe challenges on the feasibility of the
approach, as the accessible energies q are quite limited.
5
Here and in the following we assume that O(q) is a properly renormalized lattice quantity with a well-defined continuum limit and free from infrared divergences. Alternative
strategies extract αs from bare lattice quantities by taking
q ∝ a−1 and expressing their expansion in lattice perturbation theory in terms of αs (see e.g. ref. [15]). In these cases,
discretization errors and scale dependence of O(q) are entangled. Addressing systematic uncertainties becomes more subtle
and requires a separate discussion (see ref. [2]).

Mattia Dalla Brida: Past, present, and future of precision determinations of the QCD parameters from lattice QCD

As a concrete example of this situation, we can point
to the recent determination of αs of ref. [16]. For their
computation the authors employ state-of-the-art largevolume simulations by the CLS initiative [17, 18]. The twopoint functions of both axial and vector currents at shortdistances are used to extract αs . Given the range of lattice
spacings at their disposal, a ≈ 0.04−0.08 fm, the accessible
energies for which continuum limit extrapolations could be
performed in a controlled way are limited to q . 2 GeV.
As we shall see below with explicit examples, a limited
range of low q-values unavoidably implies a limited attainable precision for αs as perturbative truncation errors
become a major issue.
2.2.1 The finite volume is your friend
In order to reach high precision we must tailor the lattice
simulations to the problem at hand. Going back to eq. (2),
there is in fact no reason to try to satisfy simultaneously
the two conditions as these belong to separate problems.
On the one hand, there is the determination of the lowenergy quantities used for the hadronic renormalization of
the lattice theory, while, on the other hand, there is the
determination of O(q) for large q.
A more natural strategy is therefore to split the problem over several sets of lattice simulations, each one covering a different range of energy scales. In this way, systematic effects can be more easily kept under control, as
the relevant conditions will be milder for each individual set of simulations. The way to effectively achieve this
in practice is to employ what are known as finite-volume
renormalization schemes [9]. In this case, the scale q at
which the observable O(q) is evaluated is identified with
the inverse linear extent of the finite volume, i.e. q = L−1 .
One may say that, in fact, the observable O considered
is a finite-volume effect. With this choice, one computes
the non-perturbative RG running of O(L−1 ) by simulating lattices with different physical extent L. This strategy
goes under the name of finite-size (or step-)scaling [9, 10]
(see ref. [13] for a recent account).
More precisely, having fixed the bare QCD parameters
through some hadronic quantities, one computes O(L−1
had )
at a low-energy scale qhad ≡ L−1
≈
Λ,
and
determines
had
Lhad in physical units. This is achieved by computing
lima→0 (amhad )(Lhad /a) = O(1), where mhad is a known
low-energy scale. No large scale separations are involved
in this step, and at common bare parameters one can satisfy the conditions Lhad /a  1 and amhad  1, as well as
having finite-volume effects in mhad under control.
Secondly, one computes in the continuum limit the
change in O(L−1 ) as L is varied by a known factor, say,
L → L/2. This step is repeated a number of times n, going
from each new L to the next one. Once the energy scale
reached, qn = 2n /Lhad , is large compared to the hadronic
scales, perturbation theory can safely be applied to extract
αs (µPT = qn /s) from the value of O(qn ) (cf. eq. (1)).
It is important to emphasize that, if carefully chosen,
the only source of systematic errors that affect the determination of O(L−1 ) are discretization effects. In particu-

5

lar, no matter what the scale q = L−1 is, discretization effects are under control once L−1 = q  a−1 , i.e. L/a  1.
This approach elegantly exploits the freedom that we have
in lattice QCD in choosing the observable O(q) to completely circumvent the issue of necessarily having a finite
volume. In particular, within this strategy the computational power is entirely invested into controlling a single
systematic uncertainty.
In principle there is quite some freedom in choosing
the finite-volume observable O(q). For the strategy to be
successful in practice, however, this should have a number
of desirable properties (see e.g. ref. [13]). First of all, it
should be easily and precisely measurable in Monte Carlo
simulations. It should be computable in perturbation theory to a sufficiently high-loop order in order to guarantee
good precision in extracting αs through eq. (1). It should
preferably be gauge invariant, in order to avoid issues with
Gribov copies once studied non-perturbatively, and also
be directly measurable for zero quark masses (see below).
Finally, it should have, in general, small lattice artifacts.
In fact, it is not straightforward to find a single observable
that has all these nice features for any range of q-values.
This, however, is not a real issue as different observables
may be accurately combined in order to cover all the relevant range of scales q. We shall see explicit examples of
good complementary observables in forthcoming sections.
2.2.2 Λ-parameters, β-functions, and all that
As we leave the general discussion for entering a more
quantitative analysis of the challenges of extracting αs ,
we find convenient to reformulate the problem in slightly
different terms. First of all, it is useful to associate with
the observable O a renormalized coupling ḡO through the
relation:
2
(µ)
ḡO
O(µ) − k0
≡
4π
k1

k2 2
α (µ)+. . . ,
k1 s
(3)
where the coefficients ki ≡ ki (1) are those appearing in the
perturbative expansion, eq. (1). This simple procedure defines a non-perturbative, regularization-independent, QCD
coupling. In terms of these couplings, the extraction of
αs is interpreted as the perturbative matching between
αO and αs , where different observables O define different
renormalization schemes. The common normalization allows us to compare the value of the couplings in different
schemes as they approach the high-energy limit. This is
useful in assessing the regime of applicability of the perturbative matching as the latter can be characterized by
the value that αO should reach.
We recall at this point that the non-perturbative couplings studied within lattice QCD are implicitly defined
for a given number of quark flavors, Nf . A more proper
(N )
notation to use for the couplings is therefore αO f (µ) ≡
(Nf )
(N )
[ḡO (µ)]2 /(4π), which emphasizes the fact that ḡO f (µ)
must be considered as a coupling within the Nf -flavor theory. For ease of notation, however, in this section we will
often take the liberty of dropping the superscripts Nf and
αO (µ) ≡

µ→∞

= αs (µ)+

leave these understood, unless they are needed to avoid
any confusion or for later reference.
Having this noticed, a particularly convenient class
of schemes to consider are mass-independent (or simply
massless) renormalization schemes [19]. These are defined
in terms of observables O evaluated for vanishing quark
masses. As a result, the RG running of these couplings is
decoupled from that of the renormalized quark masses and
therefore simpler to solve. On the other hand, differently
from the physical case of massive schemes, quarks do not
decouple in the RG running of massless schemes [20, 21].
Hence, in the Nf -flavor theory the latter is characterized
by a fixed number of active flavors corresponding to Nf .6

It is clear that the Λ-parameters are non-perturbatively
defined once the corresponding couplings and β-functions
are.7 In addition, they are exact solutions of the CallanSymanzik equations [22, 23, 24], and therefore RG invariants, i.e. dΛO /dµ = 0. From a non-perturbative perspective this makes the Λ-parameters natural quantities to
compute, as they provide reference scales for both the lowand high-energy regimes of QCD. We finally stress that,
as their corresponding couplings, the Λ-parameters are defined for a given number of quark flavors, Nf (cf. eq. (4)).
Each Nf -flavor theory therefore has its own Λ-parameters.

2.2.3 Systematic uncertainties in extracting ΛMSf

has been set,8 the non-perturbative value of the coupling,
ḡPT ≡ ḡO (µPT ), in any scheme, at some high-energy scale

µPT , allows for estimating ΛMSf . Below we present two

The issue of fixing the scale of a theory with an unphysical
value of Nf will be addressed in Sect. 3.

eq. (1), our estimate for ΛMS /µPT is in principle also affected by “non-perturbative corrections”, if the coupling
ḡPT is not small enough for perturbation theory to be in
the regime of applicability. We shall come back to this
issue shortly.

Strategy 2. A second possibility to estimate ΛMS is to
first obtain from the non-perturbative value of ḡPT an estimate for ḡMS (sµPT ) using the M -loop relation, eq. (9).
Given this, we can estimate ΛMS /(sµPT ) using eq. (4) and
the perturbative expression for the β-function, eq. (6), in
the MS-scheme. As before, the knowledge of µPT in physical units then gives us ΛMS .
In order to establish the perturbative uncertainties associated with this second approach, we first recall that the
β-function in the MS-scheme is currently known to 5-loop
order [25, 26, 27]. This introduces a systematic uncertainty

in the determination of ΛMS /µPT of O ḡMS (sµPT )8 ≈
8
O ḡPT
(cf. eqs. (10) and (9)). Secondly, using eq. (4) it
is easy to show that the perturbative matching at M -loop
order between ḡPT and ḡMS (sµPT ) translates
 into a sys2M
tematic uncertainty in ΛMS /µPT of O ḡPT
.
For all schemes ḡO used in lattice QCD determinations
of ΛMS we have that M ≤ 3 (see e.g. ref. [2]). The systematic errors coming from the matching between couplings is
therefore parametrically larger than the one from the truncation of βMS . Moreover, note that for all these schemes
we have that M = N − 1, where N is the loop order at
PT
which the corresponding perturbative β-function, βO
, is
known (cf. eq. (6)).9 This means that, for the schemes ḡO
commonly used, Strategy 1. and 2. result in the same
2N −2
parametric uncertainties of O ḡPT
. Clearly, although
parametrically the same, the actual size of the corrections
might be different. In this second strategy, in particular, when matching the couplings we have the freedom to
choose the parameter s (cf. eq. (9)). Different choices can
result in different perturbative corrections to ΛMS /µPT .
Devising different strategies like the ones above and
comparing their outcome can help us assessing the systematic uncertainties in ΛMS coming from the use of perturbation theory at µPT . A truly systematic study, however,
requires to compare the determination of ΛMS /µref , where
µref is a common reference scale, for several different values of ḡPT as ḡPT → 0. Only if agreement is found among
all determinations, possibly including different strategies,
2N −2
one may be reassured that O ḡPT
terms, as well as
non-analytic terms in the coupling, are negligible within
the statistical uncertainties. In the case where, instead, the
results for ΛMS /µref show a clear dependence on ḡPT , one
should first confirm that
 this is actually compatible with
2N −2
the expected O ḡPT
corrections. If this is the case, one
may be confident that the asymptotic regime of the perturbative expansion is reached, no “non-perturbative cor9

This is the case because for all these schemes the N -loop

rections” are relevant, and one can therefore take as final
estimate for ΛMS /µref the extrapolated result for ḡPT → 0.
Clearly, the program above is ambitious. The running
of the coupling ḡPT at high energies is only logarithmic
in µPT /ΛO . Reducing the size of the perturbative truncation errors by a given factor hence requires an exponentially larger change in the energy scale µPT . In order to
accurately estimate the systematic uncertainties coming
from the use of perturbation theory one therefore needs to
cover, non-perturbatively, a wide range of energies, reaching up to very high scales.
If the chosen strategy to determine ΛMS does not allow
for this and the accessible range of ḡPT is quite limited,
one might be tempted to estimate the uncertainties due to
the application of perturbation theory in more simplistic
ways. For example, one might opt for simply adding to the
2N −2
final result an uncertainty δΛMS /ΛMS = k ḡPT
, where
k is estimated in some way from the available perturbative information. Alternatively, one might estimate these
uncertainties based on the spread of the results obtained
at the smallest available ḡPT from different strategies (e.g.
Strategy 1. vs Strategy 2.). Given the asymptotic nature of the perturbative expansion, however, these practices cannot be considered reliable in general. From the
very definition of asymptotic series the only reliable way
to assess its accuracy is to compare the series with the
full function as ḡPT → 0.10 In order to do so, the coupling
ḡPT must be varied by a sensible amount reaching down
to small values.
For the same reasons, it is not advisable to estimate the
size of “non-perturbative corrections” using some model
assumption, or use some model to extrapolate the results
for ΛMS /µref to ḡPT → 0. Our knowledge of the form of
non-perturbative effects is rather limited and the separation between what is perturbative and non-perturbative is
all but well defined. Hence, it is always debatable whether
any model that tries to capture non-analytic terms in the
coupling is really adequate to describe the data within
the given accuracy. Moreover, if the coupling ḡPT cannot
be varied much, it is difficult to really distinguish, e.g.
a power correction, from some higher-order term in ḡPT ,
when statistical errors and other uncertainties are present.
A more reliable practice is thus to avoid regions of large
2N −2
ḡPT where the O ḡPT
behavior has not clearly set in.
2.3 The accuracy of perturbation theory at high
energy
In this section we want to review some recent determinations of ΛMS which paid particular attention to the
issue of the accuracy of perturbation theory in extracting ΛMS [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. As we shall see, the concerns
exposed in the previous sections are legitimate once the
precision goals become competitive. A robust analysis of

perturbative truncation errors is essential to reach high
accuracy.

2.3.1 The high-energy regime of Nf = 3 QCD
We begin with the high-energy studies of refs. [28, 29] in
Nf = 3 QCD. In Fig. 1, we show the results from these ref(N =3)

erences for L0 ΛMSf

as a function of αPT
In this plot, µref ≡ L−1
0 ≈ 4.3 GeV, is a convenient highenergy reference scale and, as in previous sections, ḡPT ≡
ḡO (µPT ) is the value of the coupling in the given scheme at
(3)
which perturbation theory is applied to extract ΛMS /µref .
(3)

The ratio ΛMS /µref is obtained following Strategy 1. of
Sect. 2.2.3. The scales at which perturbation theory is used
correspond to µPT = 2n µref , with n = 0, . . . , 5, and range
from about 4 GeV to 140 GeV. The couplings considered
in this study, ḡO (µ) = ḡSFν (L−1 ), belong to a family of
finite-volume renormalization schemes based on the QCD
Schrödinger functional (SF) [33, 34, 35]. Different schemes
within the family are identified by different values of the
parameter ν. The precise definition of the schemes is not
important and can be found in refs. [28, 29, 36].11
(3)
In order to estimate ΛMS /µref the 3-loop approximation to the relevant β-functions, βSFν , is used. The results
(3)
for ΛMS /µref are therefore expected to show corrections of
2
O(αPT
) as αPT → 0. It is important to note at this point
that the 3-loop coefficients of the β-functions in the different SFν -schemes are given for Nf = 3 by [39, 40, 29]:12

Traditionally only the ν = 0 scheme has been considered
in applications, see e.g. refs. [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42] for some important examples.
12
For comparison the 3-loop coefficient of βMS for Nf = 3 is
(4π)3 bMS
= 0.324.
2

Hence, from the perturbative point of view all schemes
with |ν| . 1 appear to be on similar footing and the perturbative expansion of their β-functions is well behaved.
From this observation, one might naively expect that
(3)
2
the O(αPT
) corrections to ΛMS /µref obtained from different intermediate schemes are similar too. Going back to
Fig. 1, we see that in all cases the results are well de2
scribed by a O(αPT
) dependence over the whole range of
investigated couplings. This is compatible with the expectation from the known leading non-analytic term in the
expansion which is expected to be quite small at these
couplings, i.e. O(e−2.6/α ) [29]. However, we clearly see a
2
substantial difference in the size of the O(αPT
) corrections
depending on the SFν -scheme that is considered. While
2
one can find cases (ν = 0.3) where the O(αPT
) corrections
are insignificant within errors, other schemes (ν = −0.5)
show significant corrections. The results for ν = −0.5 at
αPT ≈ 0.12, for instance, show a 7 − 8% deviation from
(3)
the final result ΛMS /µref = 0.0791(19) quoted in ref. [29],
which corresponds to the gray band in the plot.
As the value of the coupling at which perturbation theory is applied becomes smaller, any significant difference
(3)
among the different determinations of ΛMS /µref steadily
fades away. In particular, once αPT ≈ 0.1 is reached,
any difference is well below the statistical uncertainties
(3)
on ΛMS /µref , which at these couplings are at the level of
(3)

2 − 3%. A robust estimate for ΛMS /µref can therefore be
obtained by taking its value at αPT ≈ 0.1 from one of the
schemes that show milder perturbative corrections. The
(3)
result ΛMS /µref = 0.0791(19) given above, for instance,
corresponds to µPT = 24 µref ≈ 70 GeV from the ν = 0
scheme (cf. ν = 0 (fit C) in Fig. 1) [29].
The first important message from this study is that it
is in fact impossible to predict the actual size of perturbative truncation errors only from the available perturbative
information. To reliably assess these errors, perturbation
theory must be tested against non-perturbative data over
a wide range of energy scales. From the study we presented, in particular, we conclude that in order to be able
to quote in full confidence the competitive precision of
(3)
2 − 3% on ΛMS /µref , one must reach non-perturbatively
αPT ≈ 0.1. At these couplings perturbative truncation er(3)
rors are fully under control and the error on ΛMS /µref is
entirely dominated by the statistical uncertainties coming
from the non-perturbative running of the coupling.
It is now instructive to look at the result of the analysis
of the same data according to Strategy 2 of Sect. 2.2.3.
(3)
The corresponding estimates for ΛMS /µref are shown in
Fig. 2 for the two cases, ν = 0, −0.5 [29]. The different
determinations in each plot are obtained by varying the
parameter s entering the perturbative matching between
the MS-coupling and the SFν -couplings (cf. eq. (9)). The
values of s considered vary by about a factor 2 − 3 around
the value of fastest apparent convergence, s∗ .13 In pheThe scale factor s∗ is defined by (cf. eq. (8)): log(s∗ ) =

nomenological determinations of the QCD coupling the
spread of the results obtained by varying s around some
“optimal” value, typically by a factor 2 or so, is commonly
used to get an estimate of perturbative truncation errors

works in the present case.

data show the expected O(αPT
data, however, can vary significantly depending on the
choice of the parameter s. As expected, the significance of
these differences is reduced as αPT → 0, and the different
determinations come together once αPT . 0.1.
What is clear from the results of Fig. 2 is that the procedure of assigning a systematic error based on the spread
of the results with s at some fixed coupling is not always
reliable. In the case of the ν = 0 scheme (left panel), the
spread in the results between, say, s∗ /2 and 2s∗ , encloses
the final estimate (gray band in the plot) for all coupling
values in the range. If this uncertainly was added to the
statistical errors, it would give a conservative estimate for
the total uncertainly. On the other hand, in the case of the

underestimates the actual size of the O(αPT
Again αPT ≈ 0.1 has to be reached for the perturbative
uncertainties to be small compared to the statistical ones.
From this second analysis we reaffirm the conclusion
that it is very difficult to reliably estimate perturbative
truncation errors if the coupling αPT cannot be varied
much, and if this is confined to values significantly larger
than αPT ≈ 0.1.

is not just a curious example. As we shall see in the following section, through the strategy of renormalization by

in terms of the flow time t0 [43], while αPT is once again
the value of the relevant coupling at the renormalization
scale µPT where perturbation is applied. Similarly to the
case of Nf = 3 QCD discussed above, different schemes
and strategies have been considered in order to extract
(0)
ΛMS /µhad and study the perturbative truncation errors. In
all cases, the non-perturbative RG running from µhad up
to µPT is obtained using a finite-volume scheme based on
the YM gradient flow (GF) [43, 44, 45, 46]. The interested
reader can find more details about the scheme in the main
refs. [30, 32] (see also Sect. 4.3).

Once µPT is reached, ΛMS /µhad is estimated in a number of ways. For the case labeled as (GF) in the plot,

β-function in the GF-scheme of choice [48]. In the other
cases, the GF-scheme is first non-perturbatively matched
to the SFν=0 -scheme introduced in the previous section.
Perturbation theory is then applied either following Strategy 1. based on the SFν=0 -scheme (SF label in the plot),
or by following Strategy 2. and matching the SFν=0 - and
MS-coupling (MS(s = 1, 2) in the figure). In the latter

twice as large as the statistical errors on the points (cf. Table 3 of ref. [32]). In the case of the (GF) and (MS(s = 1))
determinations, it is clear that a trustworthy estimate for
(0)
ΛMS /µhad can be quoted only by extrapolating the results
for αPT → 0. In general, perturbative truncation errors
are large also in the pure YM theory given the precision
one can reach.
The results above show us once again the importance
of an explicit non-perturbative calculation of the running
of the coupling over a significant range of values, reaching down to small couplings, in order to assess the actual size of the perturbative corrections. We join the authors of ref. [32] and conclude that only by studying nonperturbatively the limit αPT → 0 one can avoid the dangerous game of estimating perturbative uncertainties at
some finite (potentially large) value of αPT . Without studying this limit, the determinations can easily be affected by
perturbative truncation errors, even at surprisingly small
values of the coupling.
Large-volume schemes. A precise determination of the
Λ-parameter in the pure YM theory is certainly very much
facilitated from the computational point of view with respect to the case of QCD. However, as we have seen in the
previous example, it is yet a non-trivial challenge to control perturbative truncation errors once a 1−2% precision
in ΛMS is reached.
The disagreement among some recent determinations
(0)
of ΛMS is a clear signal that these difficulties should not
be underestimated. The issue is well illustrated in Fig. 3,

where the very precise results labeled (FlowQCD) from
ref. [47] show a net tension with the determinations of
refs. [30, 32]. We recall that the former result is based on
(0)
extracting ΛMS /µhad from the plaquette expectation value
calculated in large-volume simulations. Bare lattice perturbation theory at couplings αPT ≈ 0.095 − 0.12 is used,

). We refer the
with parametric uncertainties of O(αPT
reader to the given reference for the details. Here we just
note that all the above determinations satisfy the most
stringent criteria set by FLAG (cf. ref. [2]). Yet, one or
more of these results have underestimated uncertainties.
Other groups have recently engaged in a precision de(0)
termination of ΛMS , also with the intent of resolving the
disagreement above. The recent results of ref. [31] based
on the qq-coupling, αqq , defined from the static potential [49], are particularly interesting in this respect.14 We
report them in Fig. 4. In the case of αqq the corresponding β-function, βqq , is known up to 4-loop order, and
some partial information is available also at 5-loops (see

hence expected to have asymptotically O(αqq
In the plot, αqq refers to the coupling at which perturbation theory is used according to Strategy 1. of Sect. 2.2.3,
i.e. it corresponds to αPT in our previous discussions.
Despite the accurate perturbative knowledge there are
a few challenges when using the qq-scheme for precision
(0)
determinations of ΛMS [31]. The most relevant ones for
our discussion are, first of all, that the scheme is conventionally defined in an infinite space-time volume. In order to measure the coupling at small lattice spacings one
therefore needs large lattice sizes to maintain the physical
extent of the lattice large. In the computation of ref. [31]

A similar earlier study on the challenges of extracting ΛMS
in both Nf = 2 QCD and the pure-gauge theory using the qqcoupling can be found in ref. [50].

sult, even in the computationally simpler case of the pure
YM theory, one might have precise data confined for the
most part to a region of couplings too large to have perturbative uncertainties fully under control, while at smaller
couplings the data is not precise enough for a competitive
determination of Λ.

Figure 4 shows the results for ΛMS /µhad as a function
3
. The range of couplings covered by the data is αqq ≈
of αqq
0.16 − 0.35. As we can see from the plot, for couplings
(0)
αqq & 0.21 the results for ΛMS /µhad have good precision,
but perturbative uncertainties are large. This can be seen
by looking at the difference between the 3-loop and 4-loop
results (or analogously between the 4-loop and 4-loop +
5-loop log terms results). At these large couplings, the
perturbative expansion seems to have reached its limit of
applicability. This severely limits the precision one can
(0)
aim at for ΛMS /µhad if one is restricted to this range of
couplings. For couplings αqq . 0.21, the different orders
of perturbation theory seem to start converging. On the
other hand, the errors on the data become large. This is
due to the difficulties in extrapolating the results to the
continuum limit [31]. In fact, the errors are too large to
make definite conclusions for the relevant limit αqq → 0.
All in all, we see from this last example that a pre(0)
cise determination of ΛMS is a challenge. Finite-volume
renormalization schemes allow us to cover a wide range of
couplings, reaching down to rather small values. Yet, having control on perturbative truncation errors requires care.
When using large-volume schemes the situation is further
complicated by controlling continuum limit extrapolations
at the smallest (most relevant) couplings. Small couplings
require small lattice spacings, which require large lattice
sizes in order to keep the physical volume large. As a re-

Having discussed the difficulties of estimating perturbative truncation errors in precision determinations of the
Λ-parameters, we now want to touch on the issue of systematic uncertainties related to the continuum limit extrapolations of the relevant couplings.
To give the reader a feeling of the pitfalls that these
continuum extrapolations can conceal, we first consider
the Nf = 3 results of ref. [46]. The relevant quantity to
look at in this case is the step-scaling function (SSF) of
2
the finite-volume GF-coupling ḡGF
(µ) with SF boundary
conditions (see refs. [45, 46] and eq. (53) for the definition
of this scheme). We recall that the SSF, σ(u), encodes the
change in the coupling u when the renormalization scale is
varied by a factor of 2 [9]. Specifically, having set µ = L−1 ,
2
2 (µ)=u ,
σ(u) ≡ ḡGF
(µ/2)|ḡGF

σ(u) = lim Σ(a/L, u) .
a/L→0

(12)
It is clear from its definition that the SSF is a discrete version of the β-function. The latter can in fact be obtained
once the SSF is known in a range of couplings (cf. ref. [46]).
On the lattice, the SSF is determined by extrapolating to the continuum limit its discrete approximations,
Σ(a/L, u). In order to compute the latter one must first
identify a set of lattice sizes L/a and corresponding values
2
of the bare coupling g0 for which ḡGF
(L−1 ) = u, with u a
specific value. The lattice SSFs Σ(a/L, u) are then given
2
((2L)−1 ) measured at the values of
by the couplings ḡGF
g0 previously determined but on lattices with sizes 2L/a.
The results for the lattice SSFs of the GF-coupling of
ref. [46] are shown in Fig. 5. They correspond to 9 values
of the coupling ui ∈ [2.1, 6.5], i = 1, . . . , 9. As one can
see from the figure, the lattice data are very precise. On
the other hand, discretization effects are in general large,
particularly so at the largest couplings. The results for
Σ(u, a/L) vary in fact by up to 20% in the range of L/a
considered, which is quite a significant change compared
to the statistical errors on the points.
Given the results in Fig. 5, we may expect that a simple
fit of the data linear in (a/L)2 is all that is needed to
extrapolate these to the continuum limit. In particular,
we may consider individual continuum extrapolations for
each ui value using the functional form

where σi , ri are fit parameters. Within the uncertainties, linearly in (a/L)2 is in fact excellent and the above
fits are very good (χ2 /dof ≈ 0.7). One is thus tempted
(A)
to take the precise values for σi as estimates for the
continuum SSF.

Note that this is the functional form expected from the

the coefficient predicted by perturbation theory is slightly
different, i.e. ≈ −0.079.15 This observation suggests us to
perform alternative fits to the data in Fig. 5 considering

fits is as good as for the fits A of eq. (13). Distinguishing between the two fit forms would require significantly
higher statistical precision than the present one.
It is important to note at this point that any functional
form that we consider for the continuum extrapolations,
necessarily comes with assumptions. Both fits A and B
above, for instance, assume discretization errors of O(an ),
n ≥ 3, to be negligible. Moreover, even focusing only on
the leading O(a2 ) effects, we know from Symanzik effective theory (SymEFT) [52, 53, 54] that these are not simply given by a “classical” term ∝ (a/L)2 . They are in fact
a non-trivial combination of different terms which in the
limit a/L → 0 are asymptotically ∝ (a/L)2 ln(L/a)−Γi ,
or rather ∝ (a/L)2 [ḡ 2 (a−1 )]Γi , where Γi ∈ R, i = 1, 2, . . . ,
and ḡ 2 (a−1 ) is the given renormalized coupling of the effective theory evaluated at a scale µ = a−1 (cf. refs. [55,
56,57, 58]).

Perturbation theory predicts: σ(u) ≈ u + s0 u2 + O(u3 ),
with s0 = 2b0 (Nf ) ln(2), where b0 (Nf ) is the universal 1-loop
coefficient of the β-function, eq. (7) (see e.g. ref. [29]). The close
agreement between the non-perturbative data for σ(u) and 1loop perturbation theory is quite peculiar, considering the fact
that it holds up to σ(u) = O(10). We refer the interested reader
to ref. [46] for a detailed discussion about this point.

agree. From the results in Fig. 5 we see that there is in fact
agreement within one standard deviation. However, the
difference between the results from the two fits is clearly
systematic, with the results from fit B being always larger
than those from fit A.
The issue becomes more evident if one tries to obtain
a smooth parameterization for the continuum SSF from
the fitted continuum values σi . As noticed earlier, a fit of
∆σi = 1/σi − 1/ui to a constant ∆σ provides a good description of the continuum data σi in the whole range of
(A)
(B)
u ∈ [2.1, 6.5]; this is the case for both ∆σi and ∆σi
2
(χ /dof < 1). Given the 9 independent values of ∆σi
for each fit, the results for the corresponding ∆σ are 3
times more precise than the individual ∆σi . The systematic effect then becomes clearly noticeable as one finds:
∆σ (A) = −0.0823(4) and ∆σ (B) = −0.0832(4), for the
(A)
(B)
constant fits to ∆σi and ∆σi , respectively.
The previous considerations show that the description
of discretization errors as pure (a/L)2 effects is in this case
not accurate enough for the level of precision claimed in
the continuum limit. Even though the different functional
forms in eqs. (13) and (14) fit the data well and perfectly
agree with each other at finite L/a, the corresponding extrapolations for a/L → 0 are clearly affected by some systematics. In ref. [46], more conservative error estimates
and robust central values for the continuum results are
eventually obtained by carefully accounting as systematic
uncertainties in the data the not entirely negligible effects
of the higher-order terms neglected in eqs. (13) and (14)
(cf. ref. [46] for the details).
The example above might not seem too pessimistic.
However, it should come as a warning for the more general situation. Estimating properly the systematic uncertainties related to continuum limit extrapolations of highprecision data can easily become a challenge, particularly
so if discretization errors are not small.
As recalled earlier, the leading asymptotic dependence
of renormalized lattice quantities on the lattice spacing as
a → 0 is given by a combination of terms ∝ an [ḡ 2 (a−1 )]Γi ,
where the number and values of the Γi , as well as n, depend on the chosen discretization and set-up. The Γi are in
fact inferred from the anomalous dimensions of the fields
defining the O(an ) counterterms in the SymEFT, and the
order of perturbative improvement that has been possibly
implemented (cf. ref. [57]). Hence, when one considers a
pure an dependence for the discretization errors, one is
implicitly assuming that all Γi ≈ 0. This, however, cannot
be taken for granted.
For most cases of interest, the leading discretization
effects have n = 2, i.e. they are of O(a2 ).16 The results
16
A relevant exception is the case of the SF, for which
the leading discretization errors are parametrically of O(a)
(cf. Sect. 4.2.2). In applications, however, the O(a) effects are
subdominant with respect to the O(a2 ) effects, and often also
compared to the statistical errors. The precision studies of
refs. [46, 29, 30] thus opt for treating the O(a) effects as (small)
systematic uncertainties in the data, and perform continuum
extrapolations assuming leading O(a2 ) effects. In this respect,
we note that in refs. [57, 58] the Γi relevant for the O(a) effects

of refs. [57, 58] then show that in the case of QCD we
have O(10) different terms that contribute in general, and
Γi ≈ −0.1 − 3 for several common discretizations and values of Nf = 2 − 4.1718 Having all Γi & 0 is certainly
positive. In particular, the contributions relevant in the
massless theory all have Γi > 0, which implies a faster
approach to the continuum limit with respect to pure a2
terms. However, the large number of terms contributing
makes for a complicated pattern of discretization errors in
the general case, with no clear contribution(s) dominating.
As a result, it may be difficult in practice to identify the
terms that are actually relevant. Moreover, terms of the
form a2 [ḡ 2 (a−1 )]Γi with Γi ≈ 2 − 3 can be hard to distinguish from a3 or a4 terms in a limited range of lattice
spacings when statistical uncertainties are present.19 The
continuum estimates obtained by including different contributions, on the other hand, may vary appreciably. In
this situation, precise and robust final estimates are not
easily achieved.
We stress that it is particularly important to take these
considerations into account when aiming for precise determinations of short-distance quantities like the couplings.
As discussed in previous sections, in the most interesting
region of high energy, µ  Λ, aµ may not be so small. Conin the (pure-gauge) SF have been computed. The results support the treatment of O(a) effects pursued in refs. [46, 29, 30]
(cf. the given references for the details).
17
The results refer to the contributions to discretization effects coming from the lattice action, considering several popular options (cf. ref. [58]). If the relevant observable is not a
spectral quantity, additional effects originating from the lattice
fields that define it are present. These depend on the specific
observable and choice of discretization (see, e.g. refs. [57, 58]).
18
In the case of the pure-gauge theory only two terms from
the lattice action contribute to the O(a2 ) effects. The Γi for
different options can be found in ref. [57]. In all cases, Γi & 0.6.
19
It is clear that even though the SymEFT can predict the
form of the leading asymptotic discretization errors, it cannot
predict the region where these dominate over formally suppressed contributions. In practice, it may thus be difficult to establish the regime of applicability of the results from SymEFT.

tinuum extrapolations are thus likely to be difficult and
require special attention. Following the lines of refs. [57, 58]
one should take the non-trivial a-dependence predicted by
SymEFT into account, provided the information is available. If this is not the case, one should try at least to
estimate the uncertainties associated with neglecting logarithmic corrections to classical scaling, e.g. by considering
terms ∝ a2 [ḡ 2 (a−1 )]Γi , with Γi ≈ 1 − 3, in the fit ansätze.
Ideally, one would like to be in the situation where within
the uncertainties the continuum estimates do not sensibly
depend on whether these terms are considered or not.
Given the observations above, we want to bring the
reader’s attention to a recent study where the non-trivial
a-dependence of discretization effects was found to be a
relevant issue. Specifically, we consider the computations
of refs. [59, 48] of the GF-coupling in the pure Yang-Mills
theory using Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory.20
In this framework, the lattice theory is numerically solved
through a Monte Carlo simulation up to a finite order in
the bare coupling g0 [60, 61]. From expectation values in
this “truncated theory” one can obtain the perturbative
coefficients of the expansion of lattice quantities in g0 .
In refs. [59, 48], the GF-coupling with SF boundary

conditions ḡGF
(µ) has been computed up to two-loop or2

The coefficients k1 (a/L), k2 (a/L) are functions of the resolution a/L considered for the lattice. In order to obtain the
matching relation between the couplings in the continuum
limit the coefficients must be extrapolated for a/L → 0.
Focusing on the 1-loop coefficient, k1 (a/L), from SymEFT

of the leading term ∝ ln(L/a) implicitly depends on the
Γi predicted by SymEFT (cf. Sect. 5.2. of ref. [57] and
also ref. [58]). Compared to the case of the full theory,
the results from the truncated theory have a simpler (yet
non-trivial) cutoff dependence. Given the high precision
reached in these calculations, this allows for a clean illustration of the difficulties in continuum extrapolations.
In Fig. 6 we show the results from ref. [59] for k1 (a/L)
for two different values of the parameter c, 0.3 and 0.4,
that specifies the GF-scheme (cf. refs. [59, 48] and eq. (53)).
Two different discretizations of the observable defining the
clov
plaq
coupling (Emag
, Emag
) are also considered. The simulated
lattices have sizes L/a = 10 − 32.
Starting from the results for c = 0.3 (left panel of
Fig. 6), we see how the data is very precise but discretization effects are sizable. In the plot we then show two types
of extrapolations to the continuum limit. For the first type
(solid lines), lattices with L/a = 12 − 32 are fitted to the
asymptotic form, eq. (16), considering the leading terms
m = 2, n = 0, 1. The fits are good, χ2 /dof ∼ 1, and the
extrapolated results for the two discretizations agree well.
The m = 2, n = 1, term is in fact crucial to obtain good
fits. For the second set of extrapolations (dashed lines),
we consider instead lattices with L/a = 12 − 24. In this
case the data can be very well described by a pure (a/L)2
term (m = 2, n = 0) over the whole range of lattice sizes.
The continuum extrapolated values obtained from these
fits have significantly smaller statistical errors than the
ones from the previous fits, and yet there is perfect agreement between the two discretizations. On the other hand,
the results deviate from the previous estimates by several
of their standard deviations.
The results for c = 0.4 exhibit qualitatively the same
features, although the statistical errors on k1 (a/L) are
about a factor 2 larger and the two discretizations now
show rather different lattice artifacts. On the other hand,
cutoff effects are generally smaller than for c = 0.3, and we
thus include L/a = 10 in the fits. It is clear that in both
cases, c = 0.3, 0.4, a reliable continuum extrapolation for
k1 (a/L) is challenging due to the non-trivial a-dependence
of the data. In particular, larger lattices than the ones considered here are clearly needed in order to obtain accurate
continuum results (cf. ref. [48] for the final determination).
In conclusion, through these examples we saw how assessing the systematics related to the continuum limit extrapolations of couplings can be challenging. This is especially true when one wants to maintain the high precision
reached on the lattice data also in the continuum limit,
but discretization errors are large. It then becomes hard
to avoid systematic biases in the final determinations. To
this end, it is crucial to test all the assumptions that enter the functional forms chosen for the extrapolations. In
particular, we must keep in mind that good fits do not

3 Heavy-quark decoupling
So far we focused on the main challenges that stand on
(N )
the way of a precise determination of ΛMSf and discussed
in detail the cases of Nf = 0, 3. The interesting quantity
(5)
for phenomenology, however, is ΛMS . At present, lattice
(5)

estimates of ΛMS are for the most part based on deter(3)

minations of ΛMS , while just a handful are obtained from
(4)

ΛMS (cf. ref. [2]). As we shall recall in the next subsec(5)

tion, the most common strategy to obtain ΛMS is in fact
(3)

to non-perturbatively compute ΛMS through simulations
of the Nf = 3 theory and then rely on perturbative decoupling relations for the heavy quarks to estimate the ratios
(4)
(3)
(5)
(4)
ΛMS /ΛMS and ΛMS /ΛMS (see e.g. ref. [2]).
The main reason for this is because, as is well-known,
simulating the charm quark dynamically is at present challenging, let alone the case of the bottom quark. While the
inclusion of the charm quark in the computation of the
running of the QCD coupling may be only moderately
challenging with a suitable strategy (see e.g. ref. [64]), it
does pose important difficulties in large-volume hadronic
simulations. Besides the increased computational cost in
simulating an additional quark with respect to Nf = 2 + 1
simulations, and the more complicated tuning of the bare
QCD parameters necessary to define proper lines of constant physics, discretization effects are a serious source of
concern. Given the currently most accessible lattice spacings in hadronic simulations, say a & 0.05 fm, we have
that amc & 0.3 and amb & 1, where for definiteness we
took mc ≈ 1.27 GeV and mb ≈ 4.2 GeV. In the hadronic
regime it is therefore a real challenge to control the discretization effects induced by including the charm quark
in simulations, and unrealistic for the case of the bottom
quark. This is particularly true for the case of Wilson
quarks where the charm quark can potentially introduce
large O(amc ) effects, unless a complete Symanzik O(a)
improvement programme is carried out, which is certainly
no simple task (see e.g. ref. [65]).
In this situation, it is mandatory to assess the reliability of the strategy presented above for the determination
(5)
of ΛMS . To this end, in the following we shall recall the
general theory of decoupling of heavy quarks and critically
(5)
address its application in lattice determinations of ΛMS .
This includes both the usage of perturbation theory for
the inclusion of heavy-quark loops in the running of the

QCD coupling, that is to estimate the ratios ΛMS /ΛMS ,

As we shall see, given the current precision on ΛMS , accounting for heavy-quark effects by means of perturbation

theory in the running of the QCD coupling is remarkably
accurate, even for the case of the charm quark. In addition,
charm-quark effects in (dimensionless) low-energy quantities are found to be quite small, supporting the fact that
Nf = 2 + 1 QCD is accurate enough for establishing the
physical scale. As a result, competitive determinations of
(5)
ΛMS are possible from results in the Nf = 3 flavor theory.
3.1 The effective theory for heavy-quark decoupling
and the QCD couplings
In this subsection we introduce the effective theory of
heavy quarks and recall how this is conventionally ap(5)
plied in the determination of ΛMS . We refer the reader to
refs. [66, 67] for a more detailed presentation.
3.1.1 The effective theory for heavy-quark decoupling
We begin by considering QCD with Nf flavors of quarks,
which in short we denote QCDNf . Of these, N` are considered to be light, while the other Nh ≡ Nf − N` are
heavy. For simplicity, we assume that the light quarks are
degenerate with mass m, while the heavy quarks are also
degenerate but with a mass M  Λ. The effective theory associated with the decoupling of the heavy quarks
is formally obtained by integrating out in the functional
integral the fields associated with the heavy quarks [68].
The field theory that results is characterized by having an
infinite number of non-renormalizable interactions, which
are suppressed at low energies by negative powers of the
heavy-quark masses M . The couplings of the effective theory can be fixed order by order in M −1 by requiring that,
at each given order, a finite number of observables is equal
to the corresponding ones in the fundamental theory. Once
the couplings are fixed up to a certain order M −n , the effective theory is said to be matched to the fundamental
one at this order, and can be used to describe the effects
of the heavy quarks at low energies up to corrections of
O(M −n−1 ). In this sense, we say that as M → ∞ the
heavy quarks decouple from low-energy physics as their
effects eventually fade away [69].
In formulas, the Lagrangian of the effective theory is
of the general form (see e.g. ref. [67])
Ldec = L0 +

where the leading order corresponds to the Lagrangian of
QCD with N` light quarks, i.e. L0 = LQCDN` , while the
corrections Lk , k ≥ 1, consist of linear combinations of
local fields of mass dimension 4 + k, i.e.

with ωi dimensionless couplings. The fields Φi are built
from the light-quark and gluon fields, and include possible powers of the light-quark masses. They must respect

15

the symmetries of the fundamental QCDNf theory, as in
particular gauge invariance, Euclidean (or Lorentz) symmetry, and chiral symmetry.
In the case where the light quarks are massless, the
leading-order effective theory, QCDN` , has a single parameter: the gauge coupling ḡ (N` ) (µ). The effective and fundamental theory are therefore matched at leading order in
M −1 once ḡ (N` ) (µ) is matched. This requires that ḡ (N` ) (µ)
is properly prescribed at a given renormalization scale in
a given renormalization scheme in terms of the coupling
ḡ (Nf ) (µ) of the fundamental theory and the heavy-quark
masses M .21 In addition, provided that the fundamental
theory is defined on a manifold without boundaries,22 it is
possible to show that L1 = 0 and therefore O(M −1 ) corrections are absent [67].23 In this situation, the leadingorder corrections induced by the heavy quarks are suppressed as M −2 at low energy.
In the case where the light quarks have a non-vanishing
mass, the only mass-dimension 5 fields allowed in L1 are
given by the fields of the leading-order Lagrangian LQCDN`
multiplied by the light-quark masses m [67]. Their effect
can be reabsorbed into a redefinition of the gauge coupling and light-quark masses of O(m/M ). Of course, in
the case of massive light quarks the matching of the effective and fundamental theory at leading order also requires
the matching of the light-quark masses. In addition, the
(k)
couplings ωi of the corrections Lk≥2 will depend in general on the light-quark masses, too.
3.1.2 The effective theories and their couplings
The application of the effective theory for heavy quarks in
the determination of the QCD couplings was first advocated by Weinberg in his seminal paper on effective field
theories [68]. The idea is based on the observation that for
mass-independent renormalization schemes the RG equations of the renormalizable couplings of the effective theory completely decouple from the others. This means that
the couplings of the non-renormalizable interactions can
be completely ignored when determining the variation of
the running coupling ḡ (N` ) (µ) of the effective theory with
the energy scale µ. The heavy quarks affect the value of the
coupling of the effective theory only through the matching
with the coupling of the fundamental theory, ḡ (Nf ) (µ).
The matching relation between ḡ (N` ) (µ) and ḡ (Nf ) (µ)
can in principle be established in perturbation theory. This
is best done at a scale µmatch ≈ M [68, 20]. Assuming the
21

For ease of notation we do not use any symbol to indicate
the generic scheme of renormalized couplings. We however assume that, unless otherwise stated, the couplings are defined
in a mass-independent scheme.
22
This means that the theory lives in infinite space-time or
in a finite volume with (some variant of) periodic boundary
conditions. The special but relevant case of a finite volume
with boundaries will be considered in Sect. 4.2.3.
23
Note that for the sake of argument we exclude the uninteresting case of N` = 1, for which a proof of this result is to
our knowledge missing.

coupling ḡ (N` ) (µmatch ) in the effective theory is known, one
can turn tables and obtain ḡ (Nf ) (µmatch ) from inverting
the matching conditions.
In phenomenological applications of this strategy (see
e.g. ref. [4]), the value of ḡ (N` ) (µmatch ) is extracted from
the value of the coupling ḡ (N` ) (µlow ) at some lower energy
scale, µlow  M . The latter is obtained by comparing
the perturbative expansion for some process O(q) with
characteristic energy scale q ≈ µlow , with its experimental results. The effects of the heavy quarks in O(q) are
expected to be suppressed as O((q/M )2 ) (cf. Sect. 3.1.1).
Hence, assuming that these effects can be neglected, the
perturbative expansion of O(q) can be considered in the
N` -flavor theory, which allows the coupling ḡ (N` ) (µlow ) to
be extracted. As observed above, the determination of the
running of the effective coupling in the N` -flavor theory
does not require any input from the fundamental theory:
one can thus readily obtain ḡ (N` ) (µmatch ) from ḡ (N` ) (µlow ).
Clearly, for this strategy to work in practice the energy
scale µlow  M must be yet sufficiently high for perturbation theory to apply.
In non-perturbative applications on the lattice, the
strategy presented above is realized in the following way
(see e.g. ref. [2]). Firstly, as discussed in Sect. 2.2.3, through
the study of the non-perturbative running of a given massless coupling within the effective N` -flavor theory, one de(N )
termines the ratio ΛMS` /µhad , where µhad is a convenient
(not necessarily physical) low-energy scale. Assuming that
the effects of the heavy quarks can be neglected in the
ratio of low-energy scales µhad /µphys , where µphys is an
experimentally accessible hadronic quantity, this can also
be computed within N` -flavor QCD. The physical units of
(N )
µhad and therefore ΛMS` can then be established by taking µphys from experiments. As a second step, as we shall
see in detail in the following subsection, the matching relation between the couplings of the effective and fundamental theory is expressed as a relation between their Λ(N )
(N )
parameters. The ratio ΛMSf /ΛMS` is thus estimated using
perturbation theory at a scale µ ≈ M . From this estimate
(N )
(N )
and the results for ΛMS` , ΛMSf is obtained.
(N )

It is important to note that in extracting ΛMS` from
the running of the chosen non-perturbative scheme, perturbation theory can be applied at arbitrarily large energy
scales. The perturbative matching between the effective
and fundamental theory, instead, is best performed at a
scale µ ≈ M , where M is set by the mass of the given
heavy quarks that decouple. Whether perturbation theory is accurate in this step hence depends on how heavy
these quarks are. As we shall see, in the MS-scheme the
perturbative matching is remarkably accurate already for
masses M close to that of the charm quark.
In the next subsection we describe in detail the perturbative matching of the QCD couplings. We follow the lines
of the presentation in ref. [67], and start by reformulating
this matching in terms of Λ-parameters [20]. After doing
so, we investigate the accuracy of a perturbative matching

within perturbation theory itself, and later present a discussion on the typical size of non-perturbative corrections
one can expect in these relations.
3.2 Perturbative decoupling
3.2.1 Definitions
As we are interested only in the QCD coupling we assume
for simplicity that the relevant effective theory is given by
massless QCDN` . As discussed above, at leading order in
M −1 the only parameter of the effective theory that needs
to be fixed is therefore the running coupling ḡ (N` ) (µ). The
effective theory hence predicts any observable once the
coupling in the chosen scheme is specified at some scale.
The general form of the relation between the couplings
of the leading-order effective theory ḡ (N` ) and of the fundamental theory ḡ (Nf ) , reads [68, 20, 21]

[ḡ (N` ) (µ/Λ(N` ) )]2 = FO [ḡ (Nf ) (µ/Λ(Nf ) )]2 , M/µ , (19)
where for later convenience we explicitly wrote the dependence of the couplings on their corresponding Λ-parameter.
The function FO depends in principle on the specific observable O that is used to establish the matching between
the two theories. The dependence on the observable, however, is suppressed by powers of M −1 . In perturbation
theory, these power corrections can be uniquely isolated
from the logarithmic terms in M and can therefore be
dropped. This is consistent with matching the theories at
leading order in M −1 . In doing so, the relation between
the couplings becomes universal, i.e independent on the
specific matching condition. It only depends on the renormalization schemes chosen for the couplings.
In the MS-scheme the matching relation (also referred
to as decoupling relation) is known up to 4-loop order.
Below, we consider this only for the convenient choice
of matching scale µ = m∗ , where m∗ is implicitly defined by the equation mMS (m∗ ) = m∗ , where mMS (µ) ≡
(N )
(N )
mMSf (µ/ΛMSf ) are the running masses of the heavy quarks
in the fundamental theory in the MS-scheme. Given this
choice, the matching relation reads:
 (N` )
(N ) 2
(N )
(N )
ḡMS (m∗ /ΛMS` ) = g∗2 C(g∗ ), g∗ ≡ ḡMSf (m∗ /ΛMSf ) ,
C(g∗ ) = 1 + h2 g∗4 + h3 g∗6 + h4 g∗8 + . . . ,

(20)

where the hi are pure numbers that depend on both Nh
and N` [70, 71, 72, 73, 74]. As explained in these references,
the particular choice of matching scale makes all contributions ∝ log(mMS (µ)/µ) appearing in the matching relation vanish, and it is considered to be optimal. This implies in particular that the g∗2 term in C(g∗ ) is absent. In
the general case, the scales mMS (µ) and µ should anyway
not be chosen too separated. Large coefficients otherwise
appear in the perturbative matching relation which can
compromise its applicability.
As anticipated, from the perspective of lattice applications it is compelling to recast the matching relation,

the correct asymptotic limit [67].

perturbative expansion cannot tell us anything about the
size of non-perturbative corrections to the decoupling relations and whether perturbation theory actually applies
at all. Whether non-perturbative effects are significant
within the target precision at the relevant quark masses
can only be established through a non-perturbative investigation.
In order to set the grounds for estimating the error that
one makes when using a perturbative approximation for
(N )
(N )
P`,f to extract ΛMSf from ΛMS` , let us begin by recasting
the matching of the effective and fundamental theory in
more non-perturbative terms.25
The leading-order effective theory describes the fundamental theory at low energy only when the corresponding Λ-parameter Λ(N` ) is a properly chosen function of
the scale Λ(Nf ) of the fundamental theory and of the RGI
mass M of the heavy quarks. To be more precise, consider
a low-energy mass-scale S  M . This could be, for instance, a hadronic mass or any of the popular technical
−1/2
scales, t0 , r0−1 , w0−1 [43, 49, 79]. Matching then means

(27)

In these equations S (N` ) and S (Nf ) (M ) refer to the given
low-energy scale computed in the effective and fundamental theory, respectively. Note in particular that the matchS
ing function P`,f
(M/Λ(Nf ) ) depends on the scale S that is
considered in the matching relation. We also stress again
that while the value of Λ(Nf ) does not depend on M the
one of Λ(N` ) does depend through the matching condition.
Once Λ(N` ) is properly fixed through eq. (27) in terms
of S, for any other low-energy quantity S 0 we expect that
2 
S 0(N` ) = S 0(Nf ) (M ) + O Λ(Nf ) /M
.
(28)
25

For simplicity we consider also here the case where the
light quarks are massless.

Note that ratios of low-energy scales, instead, do not depend on the value of the Λ-parameters and are therefore
insensitive to their matching. For these, it readily holds
that

(30)

In other words, at the non-perturbative level the function
S
P`,f
intrinsically comes with O(M −2 ) ambiguities. For this
reason we shall often simply write it as P`,f , keeping the
dependence on S and the related ambiguities understood.
An interesting consequence of the above relations follows from multiplying eq. (27) by S (Nf ) (0)/Λ(Nf ) , where
S (Nf ) (0) stands for the low-energy quantity S computed
in the chiral limit of the Nf -flavor theory. Through this
simple manipulation we find that [66, 67]

where the factor

is defined in terms of the massless Nf - and N` -flavor theories. The interesting aspect of eq. (31) is that the ratio on
the l.h.s. can be computed within the fundamental theory,
while the r.h.s. is a consequence of the decoupling of the
heavy quarks. In particular, we see how the mass dependence of the ratio S (Nf ) (M )/S (Nf ) (0) is expressed in terms
S
of the function P`,f
, while the factor QS`,f is just an overall

constant. In the limit of large mass M , the mass dependence of this ratio is therefore expected to be universal
and described by perturbation theory. As a result, this relation allows us to put at test the perturbative expansion
of P`,f and estimate the typical size of non-perturbative
corrections.
To this end, it is convenient in practice to introduce

with no need for determining S (Nf ) (0) or Q`,f . As for the
M,S

functions P`,f
, the η`,f
obtained from different low-energy
quantities S are expected to differ by O((Λ(Nf ) /M )2 ) contributions. In the limit M/Λ(Nf ) → ∞, however, the massscaling function becomes universal and can asymptotically
be estimated in perturbation theory [67]. In the following
we shall see how by studying the mass-scaling function we
will be able to obtain valuable insight on the applicability
of perturbation theory in computing P`,f .

3.3.2 Non-perturbative corrections to decoupling
Non-perturbative effects in the decoupling of heavy quarks
have been systematically investigated in a series of recent
papers [66, 67, 80, 81, 82, 83], which focus on the relevant
case of the charm. The main question that these works
contribute to answer is how good of an approximation
Nf = 2 + 1 QCD is to the Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 flavor theory.
From our perspective, we are particularly interested in
(4)
understanding how precisely we can expect to obtain ΛMS
(5)

(and consequently ΛMS ) from results in Nf = 2 + 1 QCD.
As already mentioned, the first issue is to understand how
(4)
(3)
accurately we can estimate ΛMS from ΛMS by relying on a
(4)

perturbative approximation for P3,4 (Mc /ΛMS ). Secondly,
we must question how much we can rely on setting the
physical units of the theory using Nf = 2 + 1 QCD.
Studying the decoupling of the charm quark through
simulations of Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 and Nf = 2 + 1 QCD is
very challenging from the computational point of view.
As a result, the physical effects one is after can easily
end up being masked by the final uncertainties. For this
reason, the authors of refs. [66, 67, 80] have investigated
non-perturbatively a model system given by QCD with
Nf = 2 degenerate heavy quarks. When the mass of the

equation is implicitly given by the difference between Nf and
the number Nh of heavy quarks of which the mass is varied.

19

doublet of quarks becomes large the heavy quarks eventually decouple, and the theory is expected to be described at low energy by the pure Yang-Mills theory, i.e.
N` = 0 flavor QCD. Studying this model rather than the
realistic case, avoids the complications of simulating light
quarks. This allows one to reach much finer lattice spacings than typically possible in large-volume simulations
with light quarks, because the volumes are similar to those
in pure-gauge theory. Fine lattice spacings are essential to
have discretization errors under control in the presence of
quarks with masses close to that of the charm.
By studying this model one expects to be able to reliably estimate the typical size of the effects induced by the
charm in low-energy physics. In particular, the absence of
the light quarks is not expected to change the picture very
much and their effect is likely more than compensated by
the additional heavy quark present in the model. In fact,
as we shall report below, some first results have been recently obtained for the more realistic situation where a
single charm quark decouples in the presence of 3 massdegenerate lighter quarks [83]. The results collected so far
confirm the findings of the model study.
Ratios of Λ-parameters The first set of results that we
want to discuss are from ref. [67] and are shown in figure 8. They correspond to the determination of the massM,S
scaling functions η0,2
based on the gluonic low-energy
−1/2

−1/2

, w0−1 (cf. eq. (34)). The precise defscales S = t0 , tc
inition of these scales can be found in the given reference.
The results refer to the continuum limit of the model system introduced above, i.e. Nf = 2 QCD with two heavy
quarks. The RGI mass M of the heavy quarks is varied
from about Mc /8 to 1.2Mc , where Mc is the RGI mass of
the charm quark.27 The plot also includes the results for
M
η0,2
at 1- and 4-loop order in perturbation theory [67].
As one can see from the figure, the results for the massscaling functions corresponding to different low-energy observables significantly differ at the smaller values of M
in the range. As expected, however, they consistently approach each other as M → ∞. In particular, for values
of the mass close to the charm-quark mass all determinations well agree within errors, indicating the smallness of
the O(Mc−2 ) corrections.
M
The results for η0,2
are about 1/10 for M ≈ Mc , both
in perturbation theory and non-perturbatively. In fact,
within the uncertainties of roughly 10% the perturbative
and non-perturbative results perfectly agree. Note that
M
even though the relative precision on η0,2
might not seem
M
impressive, it corresponds to an absolute error on η0,2
of
about 0.01. This means, in particular, that it is reasonable
M
to assume that the difference, ∆η0,2
, between the nonM
perturbative η0,2 and its (4-loop) perturbative approximation is bounded by this error for masses M & Mc . The

M
scaling of the non-perturbative corrections ∆η0,2
to η0,2
as a function of M can then be assessed by studying the
M -dependence seen in figure 8 and comparing the results
for the different observables S [67].
Putting all this information together, the authors of
ref. [67] obtain a conservative estimate for the size of the
non-perturbative contributions ∆P0,2 to P0,2 . We shall not
report their detailed discussion here and refer the interested reader to ref. [67].28 Summarizing their conclusions,
M
given the results for ∆η0,2
obtained in the model, one
can safely state that the non-perturbative contributions
(2)
to P0,2 (Mc /ΛMS ) are at most 2% and quite likely at the
level of 0.4%. This translates into at least a 2% precision
of perturbation theory in the conversion of Λ-parameters
for the investigated case.
What can we conclude from this about the phenomeno(4)
logically interesting case of P3,4 (Mc /ΛMS )? We first note
M
that the dependence in perturbation theory of η`,f
on N` at
fixed Nh is very mild. At leading order it amounts to about
a 20% effect in going from N` = 0 to N` = 3 [67]. For this
reason, the authors of ref. [67] include an additional 50%
contribution to their estimate for the non-perturbative
M
corrections ∆η0,2
to account for the missing light-quark
effects. Secondly, our intuition from both perturbative and
28
The deviation ∆ log(P0,2 ) of the full function log(P0,2 )
from its perturbative approximation is obtained by integratM
ing ∆η0,2
in log(M/Λ) from the value of M/Λ of interest up to
M/Λ = ∞ (cf. eq. (34) and ref. [67]). In order to translate to
M
P0,2 the estimate for the non-perturbative corrections to η0,2
made for M . Mc , one therefore needs to make some assumptions on how these approach the limit M/Λ → ∞. Depending
on the assumptions, more or less conservative estimates are
obtained.

non-perturbative considerations suggests that most likely
the effects of the decoupling of a single charm quark are
about half of those of two quarks. From these observations,
one concludes that one can safely neglect non-perturbative
(3)
(4)
effects in connecting ΛMS and ΛMS down to a precision of
1.5% or better [67].
Ratios of hadronic quantities The second important category of effects that we address are non-perturbative contributions from heavy quarks to dimensionless ratios of
low-energy quantities. For us these are relevant in the
context of setting the physical scale of the theory (see
e.g. ref. [86]). As well-known, in fact, besides the technical
difficulties of computing the relevant ratios, an important
issue that one faces in setting the scale in lattice QCD is
the fact that one never really simulates the “real world”,
where experiments are conducted. Hence, when comparing the lattice results with experiments in order to set
the scale of the theory, one must “correct” the experimental quantities for effects that are not taken into account in
the lattice simulations, or at least verify that these are not
relevant once compared with the rest of the uncertainties.
The most common examples of effects to be considered are
the difference in the u- and d-quark masses, electromagnetic effects, and the unphysical number of quark flavors.
In the following we focus on the issue of estimating the
effects of the charm quark in low-energy quantities, and
to which extent this can be omitted in lattice simulations.
(4)
From the point of view of determining ΛMS from the re(3)

sults of ΛMS , thus, the relevant question is how accurate
the determination of the physical scale is from simulations
in the 3-flavor theory. This amounts to quantify how accurate it is to compute in Nf = 2+1 rather than Nf = 2+1+1

QCD, the ratios of low-energy quantities that are used to
set the physical scale.
As presented in eq. (29), the effects of heavy quarks in
dimensionless ratios of low-energy quantities are expected
to be of O(M −2 ), provided that the mass of the heavy
quarks is large enough compared to the energy scales of
the observables considered. In ref. [80] a systematic study
was conducted in order to assess the range of heavy-quark
masses for which the O(M −2 ) scaling of the heavy-quark
effects predicted by the effective theory actually sets in.
In addition, the authors estimated the typical size of these
contributions when M ≈ Mc . For their computations,
they considered the very same model of QCD with two
degenerate heavy quarks previously introduced, and the
same range of masses, M ≈ Mc /8 − 1.2Mc . The results for
several different ratios of low-energy quantities obtained
in the fundamental Nf = 2 QCD theory and in the effective pure-gauge theory were compared. Note that since the
effective theory is purely gluonic only gluonic quantities
were considered. These, however, are all relevant observables entering realistic scale-setting determinations.
p In figure 9 we show two
√ examples given by the ratios
tc /t0 (left panel) and t0 /w0 (right panel), evaluated
in the continuum limit. The results from Nf = 2 QCD
for different values of the heavy-quark masses M & Mc /4
are shown, as well as those from the effective pure-gauge
theory which correspond to M = ∞. Several fits to the
data are proposed. Let us focus first on the quadratic
(blue) and linear (green) fits in Λ/M . Among these four

fit types, the data seem to favor the leading-order effective theory
predictions: R(M ) = R(∞) + kR × Λ2 /M 2 ,
p
√
R = tc /t0 , t0 /w0 , with kR free parameters, restricted
to masses M/Λ & 2.5, i.e. M & Mc /2 (blue bands). Both
linear fits in Λ/M , either excluding (green bands) or including (green dashed lines) the point at M ≈ Mc /4 have
significantly larger χ2 per degree of freedom than the previous fits (cf. Table 3 in ref. [80]). The pure (Λ/M )2 fits
which include the M ≈ Mc /4 results (blue dashed lines),
instead, are clearly off.
Although the results do not completely exclude a linear Λ/M dependence, the fits obtained by adding to the
leading-order prediction a next-to-leading term ∝ (Λ/M )4
and including data down to M ≈ Mc /4 (red dashed lines),
further support the findings from the previous fits. Indeed,
the close agreement for M & Mc /2 of these fits and the
leading-order predictions restricted to this range, reinforce
the conclusion that the O(M −2 ) scaling sets in for masses
M & Mc /2, while for smaller masses higher-order contributions become relevant, or the expansion has broken
down entirely.
In general the corrections induced by the heavy quarks
are small. They amount to 2−3% at the smallest masses in
the plot, around Mc /4, but they are reduced significantly
below the percent level, to about 0.4%, once M ≈ Mc .
As discussed above, we expect that this result provides
a reliable estimate for the magnitude of these effects in
the realistic case of the decoupling of the charm quark in
Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 QCD. The simultaneous decoupling of two

charm-like quarks rather than just one, likely compensates
the missing effects from the light quarks; this at least in
the purely gluonic quantities under consideration.

t0 /tc and t0 /w0 . In this case, the results from Nf = 3
and Nf = 3 + 1 QCD are compared. Both simulations include 3 mass-degenerate quarks with a mass around the
physical average mass of the u-, d- and s-quarks. The
Nf = 3 + 1 simulations include in addition a fourth quark
with a mass set to the physical value of the charm. By
comparing the results of the two set of simulations one can
directly test decoupling in a close-to-real situation. As one
can see from the figure, the differences in these very precise
ratios of low-energy gluonic quantities are far below the
percent level and of the order of magnitude found in the
model. Interestingly, the ensembles generated in ref. [83]
open the possibility to study systematically the effects of
the charm quark also in fermionic low-energy observables.

Conclusions Let us summarize what we have learned from
(4)
(3)
the studies above. 1) The ratio ΛMS /ΛMS can be safely
computed in perturbation theory with a precision of at
least 1.5%, and realistically much better. In fact, it is important to stress that the estimate for non-perturbative
(4)
corrections to the function P3,4 (Mc /ΛMS ) is very conservative and the actual size of these effects is much likely
quite smaller, i.e. at the level of 0.3% or so [67]. 2) Power
corrections of O(Mc−2 ) in low-energy observables are also
found to be very small, i.e. well-below the percent level
(5)
[80]. All in all, this means that ΛMS can be accurately
(3)

predicted at the 1-2% level from ΛMS . In this respect, we
note that the competitive precision of about 0.8% on the

In the previous section we established that by relying on
perturbative decoupling relations for the charm and bot(5)
tom quarks, precise determinations of ΛMS are possible
from results in the Nf = 3 flavor theory. In order to be
able to make this statement the systematic studies on the
non-perturbative effects induced by the charm quark in
low-energy quantities have been instrumental.
Having this settled, as discussed in detail in Sect. 2, the
main challenges for an accurate determination of αs on the
lattice are: 1) controlling discretization errors in continuum limit extrapolations of the chosen non-perturbative
coupling(s), and 2) estimating the uncertainties associated
with the use of perturbation theory in extracting the Λparameter. In this respect, the combined application of
finite-volume renormalization schemes and finite-size scaling techniques has proven to be extremely effective in dealing with these difficulties, paving the way for robust and
precise lattice determinations of the QCD coupling.
The determination of ref. [11], in particular, relies on
(3)
these techniques to compute ΛMS . The calculation reaches
(3)

a final precision on ΛMS of about 3.5%, which translates
into a 0.8% uncertainty on αs (MZ ). The strength of this
result lies in the fact that all systematic uncertainties are
carefully kept under control at this competitive level of accuracy. The calculation is therefore a prominent example
of the current state-of-the-art determinations of αs from
the lattice [2]. Below we want to briefly recall the main
steps that led to this result in order to understand what
the challenges are in improving on it. For a more detailed
presentation we refer the interested reader to the original
references [28, 46, 11, 29] and reviews [89, 90, 91, 92, 93].
(3)
The ΛMS determination of ref. [11] was obtained from
the study of the non-perturbative running of some convenient finite-volume schemes from a scale of about 0.2 GeV
to roughly 70 GeV. The very high energies reached nonperturbatively allowed for a systematic and robust assessment of the uncertainties related to the application
of perturbation theory. This study has been presented in
Sect. 2.3.1, where the high-energy end of the running in
(3)
the SF-schemes and the result for ΛMS /µ0 with µ0 ≈
4.3 GeV, have been discussed in detail. The rest of the
determination is built on the following steps.
Firstly, we have the computation of the lower end of
the running and corresponding determination of the ratio
of finite-volume scales µ0 /µhad with µhad ≈ 200 MeV [46].
For this step, a novel finite-volume coupling defined in
terms of the Yang-Mills gradient flow was employed. This

allowed for reaching much greater precision than otherwise
possible using the schemes considered at high energy [94].
Note that a non-perturbative matching between the finitevolume schemes at µ0 was performed in order to continue
the running at lower energies. For illustration, we show in
figure 11 the non-perturbative running of the finite-volume
couplings over the energy range covered, together with the
results for the coupling in the MS-scheme obtained from
(3)
the corresponding determination of ΛMS (see below).
In a second step, the relation µhad /fπK was established passing
through the intermediate technical scale
p
µ∗ref = 1/ 8t∗0 [11]. Here, fπK ≡ 31 (2fK + fπ ) is a convenient combination of the pion and kaon decay constants,
while the scale µ∗ref is given in terms of the flow time t∗0
defined in the SU(3) flavor-symmetric limit [87]. This step
involved a combination of small-volume and large-volume
simulations in the hadronic regime [11]. From the experimental value of fπK the precise physical units for µhad
(3)
could be inferred and hence those of ΛMS . Finally, pertur(4)

and P4,5 (Mb /ΛMS ) to obtain ΛMS and from this αs (MZ ).

Splitting the determination of ΛMS over the above steps
was the key to keep all systematic errors under control.
With the proper choice of observables and techniques the
hard multi-scale problem of relating the low- and highenergy sectors of QCD could be solved in full confidence.
It is now instructive to look at the error budget of
this αs determination. This is given in figure 12 which

running at high energy µ ≈ 4 − 70 GeV (ΛMSf

ror squared on αs (MZ ) from the different steps described
above [89]. As it is clear from the figure, the main source
of uncertainty comes from the determination of the nonperturbative running from µhad ≈ 0.2 GeV up to µPT ≈
70 GeV, where perturbation theory is applied to extract
(3)
ΛMS /µPT (cf. Sect. 2.3.1). In particular, the error accumu(N =3)

lated by running from µ0 to µPT (labeled as ΛMSf /µ0
in the plot) contributes roughly 60% of the total budget.
It is important to recall at this point that the error coming from the running is completely dominated by
statistical uncertainties. In particular, thanks to the fact
that µPT ≈ 70 GeV was reached non-perturbatively, the
uncertainties due to the use of perturbation theory are
well below the statistical errors (cf. Sect. 2.3.1). In this
respect, we want to stress the important difference between this and the majority of other lattice determination
(3)
of ΛMS , where perturbation theory is applied at scales
µPT . 2 − 3 GeV. In these cases, a large fraction of the
final error comes from the systematic uncertainties related
to the truncation of the perturbative series and possible
remnants of non-perturbative contributions (cf. ref. [2]).
As we have seen, estimating these systematics reliably is
very challenging, particularly so when precision is desired
but the accessible range of scales is limited to low energy. In this situation, a reduction of the final uncertainties is highly non-trivial, and can eventually come only
from reaching significantly higher energy scales. Without
a step-scaling approach this is in practice extremely de-

manding in QCD given the present computational and
algorithmic capabilities.29
In the case of the step-scaling method, on the other
hand, reducing the uncertainties on the current αs (MZ )
determination is a question of reducing the statistical uncertainties coming from the running of the coupling(s) in
Nf = 3 QCD. This is in principle a straightforward task.
However, reducing the total error by an important factor,
say a factor 2 or so, is yet a non-trivial challenge from the
computational point of view.
Rather than following a brute force approach for the
reduction of the error in the computation of the running
in Nf = 3 QCD, in the following we shall discuss a novel
strategy which promises the desired error reduction in a
significantly cheaper way [12]. It is based on the ideas presented in the previous section on heavy-quark decoupling.
The distinct feature of the approach is that one can replace the non-perturbative computation of the running in
(3)
Nf = 3 QCD needed to determine ΛMS with the running
30
in the pure Yang-Mills theory.
4.2 The coupling from decoupling
4.2.1 General strategy and master formula
Let us begin by considering QCD with Nf flavors of heavy
quarks of RGI mass M . In this theory all quarks are massive and there are no light quarks. As we have seen in
Sect. 3.1.1, as the mass M becomes larger and larger this
theory is expected to be approximated better and better
by an effective theory given by the pure Yang-Mills theory.
In particular, once the Λ-parameters of the fundamental
and effective theory are properly matched, dimensionless
low-energy observables can be computed in the effective
theory up to corrections of O(M −n ), where, in general,
n = 2 if the theories are matched at leading order.
The decoupling of heavy quarks is also valid for the
interesting case of couplings defined in massive renormalization schemes [69, 20]. This is a direct consequence of the
fact that such couplings are defined in terms of dimensionless observables in the massive theory. Following the notation of Sect. 2.2.2, we indicate the generic renormalized
(N )
massive coupling in the Nf -flavor theory as ḡO f (µ, M ),
where O denotes the short-distance observable used to
define the coupling (cf. eq. (3)), while µ is the renormalization scale. From the decoupling of heavy quarks applied
to the observable O it follows that,
(Nf )

ḡO

(0)

(µ, M ) = ḡO (µ) + O(M −2 ) ,

(35)

29
We recall that with the current state-of-the-art algorithms,
the cost of QCD simulations for reducing the lattice spacing
a at fixed physical volume and number of independent configurations scales ∝ a−7 (cf. e.g. ref. [95]). Hence, reducing the
lattice spacing by a factor 2 or so requires a factor of O(100)
in the cost.
30
We take the opportunity to point out the study of ref. [96]
where ideas based on heavy-quark decoupling are considered
in order to address other RG-related problems in the context
of Beyond the Standard Model Physics.

(0)

where ḡO (µ) refers to the corresponding coupling in the
pure Yang-Mills theory evaluated at the same physical
scale µ. Note that here and below we shall loosely denote as O(M −k ) terms, contributions that contain terms
of O((Λ/M )k ) as well as O((µ/M )k ).
The decoupling relation, eq. (35), can be equivalently
recast in terms of the renormalization scales µ implicitly
defined by the couplings. Specifically, given a numerical
(N )
value for the coupling gM , we define the scales µdecf and
(0)

µdec = µdecf + O(M −2 ) .

(37)

We stress again that we assume that the Λ-parameters in
the two theories are properly matched.
From this basic observation the master formula proposed in ref. [12] follows. We start by considering the relation in eq. (27), and take for the low-energy scale S the
renormalization scale µdec defined above in terms of the
given couplings. In formulas,

defines the function P0,f , we shall turn tables and use it
(N )
(N )
(0)

to predict the ratio ΛMSf /µdecf in terms of ΛMS /µdec .
To this end, we first replace the function P0,f with its

Finally, introducing the dimensionless variables,

ϕg,O (gM ) is known. As promised, the master formula allows us to replace the non-perturbative computation of the
running of the coupling from the low-energy scale µdec up
to infinite energy in Nf -flavor QCD with the corresponding running in the pure-gauge theory. A few remarks are
in order at this point.
First of all, it is important to stress the fact that
eq. (43) is exact in the limit where M → ∞. In this limit
both the perturbative O(g∗2n−2 ) corrections and the nonperturbative O(M −2 ) contributions vanish. The basic idea
that is applied in this strategy is in fact similar to when we
(4)
(3)
extract ΛMS from ΛMS by replacing the non-perturbative
(4)

function P3,4 (Mc /ΛMS ) with its perturbative approximation to some order, neglecting both higher-order terms
and non-perturbative corrections. The crucial difference
in the present case is that the approximation can be made
systematically better by considering larger values of M ,
which, at least in principle, is a free parameter of the strategy. In this respect, note that the perturbative corrections
(N )
(N )
to P0,f (M/ΛMSf ) only depend on the value of M/ΛMSf ,
(N )

while the choice of scale µdecf does not matter. From the
results presented in Sect. 3.2.2, we infer that the perturbative errors due to the truncation of the perturbative series
(N )
(N )
for P0,f (M/ΛMSf ) are already small for M/ΛMSf ≈ 5, for
the relevant values of Nf . On the other hand, controlling
the non-perturbative O(M −2 ) terms requires to have both
(N )
(N )
O((ΛMSf /M )2 ) and O((µdecf /M )2 ) terms under control.
Whether this is possible in practice must be assessed by
carefully studying the limit M → ∞ with the accessible
values of M .
In comparing eqs. (27) and (38), the attentive reader
might have noticed that we omitted the M -dependence
(N )
on the scale µdecf . This was intentional. As we shall see in
the later subsection, in practice it is convenient in fact
(N )
to define a single scale, µdecf , common to all the Nf flavor theories defined by the different values of M .32 This
means that, as anticipated by our notation in eq. (36), we
will have different values for gM depending on the value
of M considered. The value of gM is found by comput(N ) (N )
ing ḡO f (µdecf , M ) for the given M at the common scale
32

The fact that we can set a unique scale for all theories
with different M values is a direct consequence of the fact
that they all share the very same Λ-parameter and this is M
independent.

25

(N )

µdecf . In lattice QCD, setting a common scale among
the theories with different M values can be achieved via
the bare parameters. This amounts to consider the very
same lattice discretization and establish a line of constant
(N )
physics along which µdecf is kept fixed. The massive couplings are then evaluated at matching values of the bare
coupling along this line of constant physics for the different bare quark masses corresponding to the target RGI
masses. From their continuum limit extrapolations we find
the values gM .
(N )
Finally, in order to extract ΛMSf from the results for ρ
determined from eq. (43) it is necessary to know the value
(N )
of µdecf in physical units. This is obtained by establishing
(N )
(Nf )
(Nf )
the relation µdecf /µphys
, where µphys
denotes a convenient
low-energy scale computed in Nf -flavor QCD at physical
(Nf )
values of the quark masses. The scale µphys
can thus be
related to its experimental counterpart. Of course, it goes
without saying that in order to be able to set the scale
accurately in terms of experimentally measurable quanti(N )
(5)
ties, as well as to perturbatively match ΛMSf and ΛMS ,
we must consider Nf = 3 or 4.

4.2.2 Another hard multi-scale problem?
The general strategy presented above is certainly very
compelling. As any other strategy, though, in practical
implementations it comes with its challenges. In particular, in order to have all systematic effects under control,
it is necessary to carefully address how to accommodate
in lattice simulations the different scales that enter the
problem. As we shall see, a naive approach can easily end
up facing severe limitations.
In the general situation, first of all, the space-time volume has to be large enough for finite-volume effects to be
under control in all relevant observables. This means that
the infrared cutoff set by the linear extent L of the lattice
must be much smaller than all other scales. Secondly, in
order to have small decoupling corrections in eq. (43) we
must have that the heavy-quark mass M is larger than
(N )
(N )
all other physical scales, as in particular µdecf and ΛMSf .
(N )

Note that although µdecf is in principle arbitrary, in practice it is not convenient to take this scale to be much larger
(N )
(Nf )
than ΛMSf ∼ µphys
. Last but not least, all scales have to be
well below the ultraviolet cutoff set by the lattice spacing.
Putting all these constraints together we find (cf. eq. (2)),
(N )

(N )

(N )

f
L−1  µphys
∼ ΛMSf ∼ µdecf  M  a−1 .

(44)

It is clear from this series of inequalities that having all
these scales comfortably resolved on a single lattice is challenging and requires a very large L/a. Just to give an
example, if one attempts the calculations using a stateof-the-art large-volume ensemble with, say, L/a = 100,
mπ L = 4, mπ = 140 MeV, which results in a ≈ 0.056 fm,
eq. (44) translates into M  3.5 GeV.

4.2.3 Finite-volume couplings rescue us again
Some of the constraints encoded in eq. (44) can be lifted
by considering for the coupling in eq. (35) a finite-volume
scheme, i.e. ḡO (µ, M ) ≡ ḡO (L−1 , M ) (cf. Sect. 2.2.1). With
(N )
this choice, the determination of ḡO (µdecf , M ) does not require the physical volume to be large. Furthermore, if the
(N )
decoupling scale µdecf is also defined in terms of a finite(N )
volume coupling, i.e. µdecf ≡ L−1
dec , one has some addi(N )
tional freedom in the choice of the value of µdecf . Any siz(N )
able scale separation between µdecf and the hadronic scale
(Nf )
µphys can in fact be bridged through step-scaling within
(N )

the Nf -flavor theory (cf. Sect. 2.2.1). Taking µdecf larger
(N )
at fixed z = M/µdecf , allows us to reach larger values of
(N )
M/ΛMSf , as well as to profit from simulating at smaller
(N )

values of a. On the other hand, the larger µdecf is, the
smaller is the range of energy scales for which, through
eq. (43), the running of the coupling in the Nf -flavor theory is replaced by that in pure-gauge. In practice, choosing
(N )
µdecf = O(1 GeV) is a good compromise.
By employing finite-volume couplings and scales the
only constraints that we have to meet are to have small
decoupling corrections in eq. (43), and to keep discretization errors under control. The first condition requires z =
M Ldec  1, while discretization effects are small once
aM  1 and a/Ldec  1. Putting these inequalities together we find the conditions
Ldec /a  z  1.

(45)

(N )

If we take, say, µdecf = 1 GeV and Ldec /a = 50, then
M  50 GeV. In summary, using finite-volume schemes,
for a given set of lattice sizes L/a we can reach much finer
lattice spacings a, as the extent of the lattice L does not
have to be large in physical units. Smaller a values allow
us to consider larger M values, while having aM reasonably small. Larger values of M make for a more precise
PT
approximation P0,f
(M/Λ). Still, large z values have to be
reached in order to control non-perturbative decoupling
corrections.

Heavy-quark decoupling in a finite volume As pointed
out for the case of computing the running through a stepscaling procedure (cf. Sect. 2.2.1), the choice of finitevolume coupling is dictated by several technical aspects, as
for instance, statistical precision and discretization errors.
For the strategy based on decoupling an additional factor
becomes relevant which is the size of non-perturbative contributions in the decoupling of heavy quarks (cf. eq. (35)).
In a finite volume, the situation can be quite different
from one coupling definition to another, as even the leading power in M −1 may be different.
Most finite-volume couplings that are used in practice are based on the QCD Schrödinger functional (SF)
[33,34, 35]. In the SF the quark and gluon fields satisfy

Dirichlet boundary conditions at the space-time boundaries located at x0 = 0 and T , where T is the temporal extent of the space-time volume (cf. eqs. (47)-(48)).
These boundary conditions guarantee many compelling
features [33,34]. However, they come with the price of
having, for instance, additional discretization effects of
O(a) [33, 97]. Using Symanzik effective theory these can
be understood as dimension 4 counterterms localized at
the space-time boundaries [33, 97]. In close analogy with
Symanzik effective theory an analysis of the effective Lagrangian for heavy quarks in the presence of SF boundary
conditions shows that the same boundary fields appear
as O(M −1 ) counterterms. More precisely, considering the
relevant case N` = 0, the Lagrangian L1 in eq. (17) has
the form (cf. eq. (18))


L1 = ωb (g) B(0) + B(T ) ,
Z
1
B(x0 ) = − 2
dx tr{F0k (x)F0k (x)}|x0 ,
(46)
g
where Fµν (x) is the gluon field strength tensor, while ωb is
a coefficient function that can be fixed by matching with
the fundamental Nf -flavor theory. Note that for simplicity we listed the only gluonic operator that is relevant
for the class of the SF boundary conditions normally employed (cf. eqs. (47)). As a result, if couplings based on the
SF are considered, the decoupling relations eqs. (35),(43)
must be corrected to have leading O(M −1 ) corrections
rather than O(M −2 ) [38, 98, 12].33 On the other hand,
finite-volume couplings defined through some variant of
periodic boundary conditions, as for instance regular periodic [44] or twisted [101, 102] boundary conditions, have
leading decoupling corrections of O(M −2 ), as observables
in infinite space-time.
There are several possibilities to deal with the issue of
O(M −1 ) corrections in SF-based couplings. A straightforward one is to consider a sufficiently large time extent T ,
and take for the observable O that defines the couplings
fields which are localized in the middle of the space-time
manifold, i.e. at x0 = T /2. This maximizes the distance
from the boundaries and therefore the correlation between
O and the fields responsible for O(M −1 ) effects. In fact,
at low energy (i.e. relatively large physical L and T ) the
O(M −1 ) contaminations are expected to be exponentially
suppressed with the distance of O from the boundaries.
More elegant solutions have been proposed which eliminate entirely the issue. For example, one could consider
33
The list of O(M −1 ) counterterms for the more general
case, including the situation where the effective theory also
contains light quarks, can be inferred from the O(a) counterterms of the Symanzik effective theory for the SF [97]. It should
be clear that the analogy only refers to the fields entering the
counterterms and, in general, it does not extend to their coefficient functions ωb . In particular, one expects different basis
of counterterm fields to appear at higher orders in the effective
theories, as the two theories have different defining symmetries.
From these observations, one concludes that also finite-volume
couplings based on open-SF [99] or open [100] boundary conditions are affected by O(M −1 ) corrections.

Mattia Dalla Brida: Past, present, and future of precision determinations of the QCD parameters from lattice QCD

for the heavy quarks a twisted rather than a standard
mass [103, 104, 105, 106]. In this case, one can show that
L1 = 0 and the decoupling in the SF is realized with
−2
O(Mtw
) corrections, where Mtw is the heavy twisted mass
of the quarks [98]. Equivalent in the continuum is the situation where the heavy quarks have a standard mass but
the SF boundary conditions are chirally rotated [107, 98,
108] (see also refs. [109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114]). The issue
with these solutions is that they require an even number
of flavors Nf . They are therefore a promising approach for
the case of Nf = 4 QCD. For Nf = 3, one may consider
having a doublet of twisted-mass quarks and a regular
massive quark (or equivalently a doublet of chirally rotated quarks and a regular SF quark (see e.g. ref. [114])).
This would reduce the O(M −1 ) contributions to those of
only a single flavor.
Another possibility that we want to mention, which
is valid for any choice of Nf , is to match the effective
and fundamental theory at O(M −1 ) [115]. In other words,
by equating the results for some convenient observable in
the effective and fundamental theory one can determine
the coefficient ωb appearing in eq. (46). Once this is determined, the O(M −1 ) terms can be taken into account
in the effective theory by computing the insertion of the
counterterm in eq. (46) in the relevant observables. This
guarantees that the decoupling corrections are of O(M −2 ).

4.3 ΛMS from the decoupling of heavy quarks
In this subsection we present the results of ref. [12] where
the master formula, eq. (43), was first applied for the
(3)
computation of ΛMS . The study considers Nf = 3 QCD
which is set on the lattice in terms of non-perturbatively
O(a)-improved Wilson quarks and the tree-level Symanzik
O(a2 )-improved gauge action [116].34
The theory is defined in a finite volume with time extent T and spatial size L. The quark fields ψ, ψ and the
gauge field Aµ satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions in the
time direction, specifically (P± ≡ 12 (1 ± γ0 )) [33, 34, 97],
P+ ψ(x)|x0 =0 = 0 = P− ψ(x)|x0 =T ,
ψ(x)P− |x0 =0 = 0 = ψ(x)P+ |x0 =T ,
Ak (x)|x0 =0,T = 0 ,

(47)

k = 1, 2, 3, while in the spatial directions we have
i

ψ(x + k̂L) = e 2 ψ(x) ,

i

ψ(x + k̂L) = ψ(x)e− 2 ,

Aµ (x + k̂L) = Aµ (x) .

(48)

The finite-volume couplings that we consider in the following are constructed in terms of the gradient flow field
Bµ (t, x) which is defined by the equations [117, 43],
∂t Bµ (t, x) = Dν Gνµ (t, x) ,

Bµ (0, x) = Aµ (x) ,

(49)

34
For ease of presentation in the following we use continuum
notation to introduce the relevant definitions while referring to
the literature for the corresponding lattice expressions.

27

where t > 0 is the flow time and
Gµν = ∂µ Bν − ∂ν Bµ + [Bµ , Bν ] ,

(50)

is the flow field strength tensor. On the lattice several
discretizations of the GF equations have been considered,
here we employ the Symanzik O(a2 )-improved definition
proposed in ref. [118], also known as Zeuthen flow.
Gauge-invariant composite fields made out of the flow
field Bµ (t, x) are automatically finite [119], and are thus
ideal quantities to define renormalized couplings [43, 44,
45]. The definition to which we apply decoupling (cf. eq. (35))
is the massive finite-volume scheme given by
(3)

[ḡGFT (µ, M )]2 ≡

t2
hEmag (t, x)iSF,Q=0
N

√
x0 =L,µ=L−1 , 8t=cL
T =2L

(51)

where N is a normalization constant [45] and

Emag (t, x) = − 12 tr{Gkl (t, x)Gkl (t, x)}

(52)

is the magnetic component of the energy density of the
flow field Bµ (t, x). On the lattice, we define Emag in terms
of the O(a2 )-improved definition given in ref. [118].
Note how in eq. (51) the renormalization scale µ is
set in terms of the finite spatial extent L, as appropriate
for a finite-volume coupling. In order for the coupling to
depend on a single scale (apart from M ), the flow time
t is also linked to L through the constant c [44, 45]. The
value of this constant is in principle arbitrary, but experience suggests that c = 0.3 is a good compromise between
statistical precision and discretization errors [45]. From
the point of view of decoupling, we note that the larger
the value of c is, the more sensitive the coupling is to the
O(M −1 ) counterterms located at x0 = 0, T . This is so because for larger values of t the footprint of the flow field
Bµ (t, x) extends closer to the boundaries.
In order to attenuate the sensitivity to the O(M −1 )
terms, in eq. (51) we consider a space-time volume with
T = 2L, and place the energy density Emag (t, x) at x0 =
T /2, in order to maximize the distance from the boundaries (cf. Sect. 4.2.3). Taking only the magnetic part of the
flow energy density also helps in reducing the O(M −1 )
contaminations.35 Lastly, we note that the expectation
value h· · · iSF,Q=0 in eq. (51) is meant to be considered
in the presence of the SF boundary conditions, eqs. (47)(48), and restricted to gauge fields in the trivial topological
sector [120, 46]. The latter constraint is imposed in order
to circumvent issues related to topology freezing at small
lattice spacings [121, 122].
Having introduced the massive scheme of choice, we
(3)
now move to the definition of the decoupling scale µdec .
We define this in terms of a massless finite-volume coupling. Its definition slightly differs from that of eq. (51).
Specifically, we take [45, 46],
(3)

[ḡGF (µ)]2 ≡

t2
hEmag (t, x)iSF,Q=0
N0

√
x0 =L/2,µ=L−1 , 8t=cL
M =0,T =L

,

(53)

35
These choices made for reducing O(M −1 ) effects are also
effective in reducing the sensitivity to the O(a) effects stemming from the space-time boundaries (cf. Sect. 4.2.3).

where as before we set c = 0.3. The main differences with
respect to the definition in eq. (51) are that the coupling is
evaluated at vanishing (renormalized) quark masses and
the temporal extent is shorter, i.e. T = L. The reason
for considering this specific definition is because its nonperturbative running in the Nf = 3 theory is known very
precisely in the range of scales µ ≈ 0.2−4 GeV (see ref. [46]
(3)
and Sect. 4.1). This gives us the freedom to choose for µdec
the most convenient value in this range. Its physical units
can in fact be inferred from combining the knowledge of
(3)
the non-perturbative β-function of ḡGF (µ) [46] and the
(3)
physical scales µphys determined in large-volume hadronic
simulations [87, 11].36
In this study, the decoupling scale is specified by the
condition
(3)
(3)
[ḡGF (µdec )]2 = 3.95 ≡ u0 ,
(54)
which using the information mentioned above is found to
correspond to
(3)

µdec = 789(15) MeV ≡ L−1
dec .

(55)

This scale is convenient in practice as, given our choice
of lattice resolutions (see below), it allows us to simulate at values of the lattice spacing sensibly smaller than
those typically accessible to large-volume simulations. As
we shall see, this enables us to simulate quark masses up
to M ≈ 4Mc , while having aM effects under good control. Additionally, we can profit from some perturbative
information in the treatment of O(aM ) effects, which is
expected to be accurate enough at the values of the bare
coupling corresponding to the relevant lattice spacings.
(3)
Lastly, the value of µdec is low enough in energy that only
a very limited part of the running in Nf = 3 QCD is
(3)
needed in order to connect it to the scales µphys and set
its physical units.
The next step in the strategy is to determine the value
(3)
(3)
of the coupling ḡGFT (µdec , M ) for some large quark masses.
(3)
(3)
To this end, we must evaluate the coupling ḡGFT (µdec , M )
(3)
for several values of the lattice spacing at fixed µdec and
given M , and extrapolate it to the continuum limit.
The condition in eq. (54) defines the line of constant
(3)
physics along which µdec is constant. Given a set of lattice sizes L/a, by tuning the bare coupling g0 so that the
massless GF-coupling has the prescribed value u0 , we can
identify the values of a for which L = Ldec is fixed in
physical units as a/L → 0. In this respect, note that in
(3)
(3)
order to compute the massive coupling ḡGFT (µdec , M ) and
(3)
(3)
the massless coupling ḡGF (µdec ) at matching values of the
lattice spacing up to O((aM )2 ) corrections, the two must
be evaluated at the same value of the O(a)-improved bare
coupling g̃0 [97]. The latter, we recall, is defined as [97],
g̃02 ≡ g02 (1 + bg (g̃0 )amq ) ,
36

mq = m0 − mcr (g̃0 ) ,

(56)

The latter are given by a combination of pion and kaon
decay constants (cf. refs. [87, 11] and Sect. 4.1 for more details).

where m0 is the bare quark mass, mcr is its critical value at
which the (renormalized) quark masses vanish, and bg (g̃0 )
is a function of the bare coupling to be determined. In the
massless theory mq = 0, and the improved bare coupling
coincides with g0 . The values of g0 determined from the
condition (54) in terms of the massless coupling therefore specify the values of g̃0 at which the massive couplings should be evaluated. According to the Symanzik improvement programme, the coefficient bg (g̃0 ) can be tuned
in order to remove O(amq ) effects in the matching between the massless and massive renormalization schemes.
At present, however, this is only known to 1-loop order
in lattice perturbation theory, where bg (g0 ) = 0.012 g02 ×
Nf + O(g04 ) [38, 97].
Together with the bare coupling, the bare quark masses
must be set in order to guarantee a given value for the
RGI mass M in the continuum limit. This is achieved by
considering a value of z = M Ldec , and by solving for a
given lattice size Ldec /a the following equation for the
bare quark masses,
z=

Ldec
M
Zm (g̃0 , a/Ldec )am̃q .

(57)

dec

In this equation,
m̃q = mq (1 + bm (g̃0 )amq ) ,

mq = m0 − mcr (g̃0 ) , (58)

is the O(a)-improved definition for the bare quark mass,
which replaces the regular bare mass mq in order to eliminate O(amq ) effects in massive schemes [97]. To this end,
the function bm (g̃0 ) must be properly chosen. The function
Zm (g̃0 , a/L), instead, refers to the renormalization constant that relates the bare quark mass to the renormalized
quark mass mSF (µ) in the SF-scheme of refs. [123, 124, 125,
126]. This, together with the improvement coefficient bm ,
and the critical mass mcr , are known non-perturbatively
for the relevant parameters (see ref. [12]). The matching
(3) (3)
factor M/mSF (µdec ) then allows us to convert the renor(3)
malized quark mass in the SF-scheme at the scale µdec to
the RGI mass M . It can be obtained from the results of
ref. [126]. Once amq for the given z is known from eq. (57)
at the values of g̃0 given by the condition eq. (54), using
the 1-loop results for bg we can infer from eq. (56) the
values of g0 at which the massive couplings must be computed in simulations [12].
Having set the bare parameters we can finally evaluate
the functions,

In figure 13 the results for the extrapolations in eq. (59)
are shown. Several values of z have been considered, ranging from z ≈ 2 − 8, which correspond to RGI masses
M ≈ 1.6 − 6.3 GeV. The different values of z will allow us
to assess the size of the non-perturbative corrections to decoupling in eq. (43). The range of lattice sizes considered
is L/a = 12 − 32.
As one can see from the figure, as expected, the continuum limit extrapolations become more challenging as z

data seem to be well described by O(a2 ) discretization errors. In order to assess systematic effects in the extrapolations, fits with different cuts in aM have been considered,
specifically (aM )2 < 1/8, 1/4. The results from the different fits are compatible, with the results for (aM )2 < 1/8
having significantly larger errors at large values of z, where
fewer points are left after the cut is imposed. We take as
final results those with cut (aM )2 < 1/8.
A last step separates us from applying eq. (43) to com(3)
pute ΛMS . In order to use eq. (43) directly in the GFTscheme of eq. (51) the non-perturbative running of the cor(0)
responding coupling in the pure-gauge theory, ḡGFT (µ),
should be known. This, however, has never been computed. On the other hand, the running of the pure-gauge
(0)
coupling in the GF-scheme, ḡGF (µ), is known very precisely [30]. In other to resolve the issue, all we have to do
is to match non-perturbatively the GFT- and GF-schemes
in the pure Yang-Mills theory. More precisely, we need to

4.4 Summary and miscellaneous remarks
The results of ref. [12] put on solid grounds the application of the decoupling relation eq. (43) as a novel strategy to determine the QCD coupling from lattice QCD.
The remarkable feature of this approach is that the nonperturbative running of the coupling from the low-energy
scale µdec up to high energy is done entirely in the puregauge theory. This opens up the possibility to significantly
reduce the current error on αs (cf. Sects. 4.1 and 5).

from the figure, excluding the point at z ≈ 2, the nonperturbative corrections to decoupling are small. At larger
z values they are compatible with O(z −2 ) scaling, indicating that the O(z −1 ) corrections due to the SF boundary
conditions are subdominant. For values of M ≈ 6.3 GeV
(i.e. z = 8) the estimated ρ agrees well with the fully

to a few GeV. At these large masses, perturbation theory
(N )
for the function P0,f (M/ΛMSf ) works extremely well and
non-perturbative O(M −2 ) corrections to the decoupling
relations are found to be small.
From the results of figure 14 we can appreciate how
the strategy based on decoupling promises great accuracy.
The z → ∞ extrapolations give in fact results for ρ which
are about a factor 2 more precise than those obtained
(3)
(3)
using the current FLAG estimate for ΛMS and µdec from
eq. (55). In order to set this result on firmer grounds, however, a robust z → ∞ extrapolation must be performed.
To this end, it is important that the continuum limit extrapolations for the massive couplings Ψ M (u0 , z) are made
more solid at the largest (most relevant) z values by investing some additional computational effort. The lattices
used for the computations entering figure 13 are in fact
rather modest. The largest simulated lattices have L/a =
32, T /a = 64. In addition, the large quark masses make
these simulations significantly cheaper than the more common massless SF simulations. A factor two finer lattices
are hence within reach with affordable computational resources. These lattices will allow us to consider larger
quark masses too, and thus improve even further the control on the z → ∞ extrapolations. All in all, we can expect
that after these improvements the final determination for
z → ∞ will be at least as precise as the results in figure
14 promise, but will include conservative estimates for all
systematics.
It is important to note at this point that a significant
fraction of the error on ρ at finite z comes from the un(0)
(0)
certainty on ΛMS /µdec from ref. [30], which is about 1.5%
(cf. figure 14). A reduction of this error down to 0.5% or
so is desirable and in principle possible. Given the impor(3)
tance of the result for the determination of ΛMS , however,
it is crucial that this error reduction is achieved robustly.
As discussed in Sect. 2.3.2, even though the determination

of Λ in the pure Yang-Mills theory is very much simplified
from the computational point of view compared to QCD,
the problem is yet non-trivial and care must be taken, especially if such a high precision is desired. For this reason,
(0)
it is mandatory that the results for ΛMS are corroborated
by investigating different strategies where the estimates of
systematic uncertainties are put to a stringent test. As we
have seen, there is currently tension among different de(0)
terminations of ΛMS , some of which quote the desired sub
percent precision (cf. Sect. 2.3.2 and ref. [30]). Studies as
the ones of refs. [31, 32] are hence encouraged in order to
(0)
set the actual accuracy at which we currently know ΛMS .
This corroboration goes hand in hand with the explo(0)
ration of new strategies for the determination of ΛMS . In
this respect we point out the results of ref. [32], where
an alternative way to do step-scaling for GF-based couplings was proposed and tested. In short, the change of
renormalization scale in the coupling is first achieved by
changing the flow time at fixed physical volume and in a
second step the physical volume is changed at fixed flow
time. This has to be compared with the traditional situation where both flow time and spatial size are changed
at once. One of the interesting features of the approach is
that it amounts to a reanalysis of data gathered from a
traditional step-scaling study. However, the systematics to
deal with are quite independent given the different continuum limit extrapolations involved. By comparing the two
analysis one can stringently test the assumptions made in
one or the other approach.
Furthermore, it would be interesting to employ other
definitions of finite-volume schemes based on either different observables and/or set-ups. For instance, the GFcoupling with twisted boundary conditions explored in
refs. [102, 127, 128, 129] is promising. Differently from the
SF case it enjoys full translational invariance and yet its
perturbative expansion in finite volume appears feasible [130].

Mattia Dalla Brida: Past, present, and future of precision determinations of the QCD parameters from lattice QCD

Of course, standard periodic boundary conditions are also
an option [44] despite the difficulties with perturbation
theory in this set-up. In fact, in cases where the perturbative information is limited or the relevant perturbative
expansion is poorly convergent, a viable option is to nonperturbatively match the given finite-volume scheme to
some other scheme for which the perturbative β-function
is known to high-loop order and it is well behaved (see
e.g. refs. [46, 30]). This may allow for a significantly more
(0)
precise determination of ΛMS (cf. Sect. 2.3.2). In this respect, we note that a powerful framework for automated
numerical high-loop calculations in finite volume has been
recently developed and successfully applied [48, 131].
Another idea that may be interesting to consider is
(0)
the determination of ΛMS based on the infinite-volume βfunction of GF-based couplings, following the strategy of
refs. [132, 133, 134] (see also ref. [99]). In this approach,
the infinite-volume results are obtained by extrapolations
from small-volume simulations, which might already be at
hand from a conventional step-scaling study. If the (nontrivial) infinite-volume extrapolations can be performed in
a controlled way and the convergence to the perturbative
regime of the chosen scheme is fast enough, this strategy may allow for interesting crosschecks of the results
from step-scaling. In this case, the framework developed
in ref. [135] can be used to obtain the necessary infinitevolume perturbative information to high-loop order.
Besides applying different strategies for the calcula(0)
tion of ΛMS , different techniques can be considered for
the QCD part of the decoupling strategy as well. A simple
extension is to consider different schemes for the massive
finite-volume coupling. In the case of Nf = 3 QCD, periodic and twisted boundary conditions would avoid entirely
the issue with O(M −1 ) contaminations. For Nf = 4 QCD
twisted boundary conditions cannot be implemented [136],
but twisted-mass fermions with SF boundary conditions
or regular massive quarks with chirally rotated boundary
conditions are available options (cf. Sect. 4.2.3).
A substantially different approach is to avoid entirely
finite-volume couplings and rely on heavy-quark decoupling in hadronic quantities. Particularly interesting observables to consider are the popular gluonic scales S =
−1/2 −1/2
t0 , tc
, w0−1 , r0 [43, 67, 79, 49]. In this case, the decoupling relation is applied more directly in the form of
eq. (27), specifically,

(N )

used to solve the above equation for ΛMSf /S (Nf ) (M ). All
(N )

that is left to do to determine ΛMSf is then to fix the physical units of the low-energy quantity S (Nf ) (M ) computed
in a theory with Nf heavy quarks of RGI mass M . This
can be obtained by relating S (Nf ) (M ) to some convenient

f
physical scale µphys
evaluated at physical quark masses via
the bare parameters. As discussed in Sect. 4.2.2, it might
be difficult to reach large masses M with this approach,
while having discretization errors and finite-volume effects
under control. Some compromises are likely necessary in
order to reach high enough M values to be able to control
decoupling corrections. On the other hand, the studies of
refs. [80, 67] show that interesting results may be obtained
if masses close to that of the charm can be reliably reached.
This makes the strategy worth being explored.

5 Conclusions
In this contribution we presented a novel strategy for the
determination of the QCD coupling using lattice QCD. It
exploits the decoupling of heavy quarks at low energy to
connect the pure Yang-Mills theory and QCD with Nf flavors of quarks. The main result is that the computation
of the running of the coupling from a known low-energy
scale µdec = O(1 GeV) up to high energies can be done entirely in the pure-gauge theory instead of Nf -flavor QCD.
Considering Nf = 3 or 4, this paves the way for unprece(N )
(5)
dented precision determinations of ΛMSf from which ΛMS
and αs can be obtained. In ref. [12] the potential of these
methods was successfully established in the determination
(3)
of ΛMS . We now want to put this result into context of a
future precision αs extraction.
(3)
(3)
As presented in Sect. 4.3, the results for ΛMS /µdec from
decoupling have an uncertainty which is about half the one
(3)
obtained using the FLAG average ΛMS = 343(12) MeV [2]
(3)

and µdec = 789(15) MeV from eq. (55) (cf. figure 14). As
discussed in Sect. 4.4, by investing some modest computational effort, this result can be set on very solid grounds by
improving the continuum limits of the massive couplings
(cf. figure 13) and performing a robust z → ∞ extrapolation (cf. figure 14). Considering lattices twice as large as
the ones simulated in ref. [12] is in fact affordable. With
such lattices we can expect that the continuum limit extrapolations of Ψ M (u0 , z) in eq. (59) can be performed
with confidence also at the largest masses investigated so
far (M ≈ 6 GeV). In addition, we will be able to consider
some larger z values, too.
(3)
(3)
The precision on ΛMS /µdec can be further improved
significantly by reducing the uncertainties coming from
(0)
(0)
the pure-gauge determination of ΛMS /µdec , which has the
(conservative) error of 1.5% [30]. As noticed in Sect. 4.4,
this error can in principle be reduced by a substantial
factor, e.g. down to 0.5%. However, while it is certainly
possible to reach such a high precision in a given computation, it is crucial that the results of different analysis
and groups corroborate it. At present, there is in fact ten(0)
sion among determinations of ΛMS involving results with
sub-percent accuracy (cf. Sect. 2.3.2). It is important to
understand the origin of these differences. We hope that
the renovated interest in this quantity brought by this new

32

Mattia Dalla Brida: Past, present, and future of precision determinations of the QCD parameters from lattice QCD

strategy motivates the community to resolve the issue and
contribute to a high-precision determination.
Once the above steps are achieved the precision on
(3)
(3)
ΛMS will be limited by the present error on µdec , which is
about 2%. A reduction of this error down to 1% is however foreseeable. It requires, first of all, to improve the
(3)
results for the running of the GF-coupling ḡGF (µ) at energies µ < µdec [46]. We recall that this is needed in order
(3)
(3)
to connect µdec with the hadronic scales µphys used to set
the physical units of the theory (cf. Sect. 4.3). Work in
this direction has already started as part of the HQET
efforts by the ALPHA Collaboration (cf. ref. [137]). Sec(3)
ondly, the scale setting in terms of the physical scales µphys
must be improved as well. In practice, this means to obtain a more precise determination for a convenient lowenergy reference scale in Nfp= 3 QCD in physical units,
like for example, µ∗ref = 1/ 8t∗0 (cf. ref. [87]). A precision of 1% or better on this or similar scales is desirable.
This is expected to be possible by exploiting the new CLS
ensembles close to the physical point [17, 88, 138]. Also in
this case, however, corroboration from different strategies
and groups is important.
(3)

Through all these steps a determination of ΛMS with
a final uncertainty of 1-2% appears feasible. As discussed
(5)
in Sect. 3.3.2, at this level of precision ΛMS can yet be ob(3)

tained from ΛMS by relying on the perturbative decoupling
of the charm quark, eventually including some conservative estimate for the unaccounted non-perturbative corrections. A determination of αs (MZ ) at the level of 0.4% is
therefore within reach thanks to the novel techniques. To
further halve the error on αs (MZ ), on the other hand, requires several issues to be reconsidered. Non-perturbative
decoupling effects might become relevant, and one might
need to include electromagnetic and mu 6= md effects in
the lattice computations in order to set the physical scale
of the theory to a greater level of accuracy (cf. Sect. 3.3.2).
Before concluding we want to note that even though
(N )
our emphasis was on the determination of ΛMSf , the ideas
presented can be extended to solve other RG problems.
A clear case is that of the quark masses, where one can
replace their running in Nf -flavor QCD with the one in
the quenched approximation. In ref. [82] a similar application was in fact explored in order to study the nonperturbative charm-quark effects in the determination of
the charm-quark mass itself. More complicated composite operators, like for instance four-quark operators, require more thought. First of all, a study of the quality
of their perturbative decoupling relations is necessary in
order to establish whether the strategy has any chance to
be applied in the first place. Then, an investigation of the
non-perturbative decoupling corrections must follow.
In conclusion, we can affirm that the decoupling of
heavy quarks enters at full right in the renormalization
toolkit of the lattice field theorist. Many more applications
of these powerful ideas in lattice QCD and lattice field
theory in general are likely to come.
