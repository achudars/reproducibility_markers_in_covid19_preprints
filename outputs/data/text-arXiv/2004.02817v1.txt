Abstract
Background: There is a great deal of uncertainty about the role of different age groups in
propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in different countries, particularly under the current
social distancing practices.
Methods: We used the Robert Koch Institute data on weekly COVID-19 cases in different age
groups in Germany. To minimize the effect of changes in healthcare seeking behavior and
testing practices, we included the following age groups in the analyses: 10-14y, 15-19y, 2024y, 25-29y, 30-34y, 35-39y, 40-44y, 45-49y. For each age group 𝑔 above, we considered the
proportion 𝑃𝐿(𝑔) of individuals in age group 𝑔 among all detected cases aged 10-49y during
weeks 13-14, 2020 (later period), as well as corresponding proportion 𝑃𝐸(𝑔) for weeks 1011, 2020 (early period), and defined the relative risk 𝑅𝑅(𝑔) for the age group 𝑔 to be the ratio
𝑅𝑅 𝑔 = 𝑃𝐿(𝑔)/𝑃𝐸(𝑔). For each pair of age groups 𝑔1, 𝑔2, a higher value of 𝑅𝑅(𝑔1)
compared to 𝑅𝑅(𝑔2), or, alternatively, a value above 1 for the odds ratio 𝑂𝑅 𝑔1, 𝑔2 =
𝑅𝑅(𝑔1)/𝑅𝑅(𝑔2) for a COVID-19 case to be in group 𝑔1 vs. 𝑔2 for the later vs. early periods is
interpreted as the relative increase in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 in the age
group 𝑔1 compared to 𝑔2 for the later vs. early period.
Results: The relative risk 𝑅𝑅(𝑔) was highest for individuals aged 20-24y (RR=1.4(95% CI
(1.27,1.55))), followed by individuals aged 15-19y (RR=1.14(0.99,1.32)), aged 30-34y (RR=

1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged 25-29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35-39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged
40-44y (RR=0.9(0.83,0.98)), aged 45-49y (RR=0.83(0.77,0.89)) and aged 10-14y
(RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). For the age group 20-24y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group
for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. For the age group
15-19y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group either above 35y or 10-14y for a case to
be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1.
Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in the prevalence of individuals aged
15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) among detected COVID-19 cases in Germany is
unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care or the
likelihood of being tested for individuals in those age groups compared to individuals aged 3549y or 10-14y, and should be indicative of the actual increase in the prevalence of individuals
aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population. That increase likely
reflects elevated mixing among individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y)
compared to other age groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices.

Introduction
The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused over 1,133,000 detected cases of COVID-19
illness worldwide and claimed over 62,700 lives as of April 5, 2020 [1]. Various forms of social
distancing measures/testing practices were implemented in different countries/regions in
order to stem the spread of the epidemic. Under those social distancing measures, rates of
contact between individuals in different age groups are expected to significantly depart from
the regular mixing patterns [2]. Under such circumstances, there is a great deal of uncertainty
regarding the role of different age groups in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in
different countries. While disease is most severe in older age groups, a sizeable share of
COVID-19 related hospitalizations in Western countries belongs to individuals aged 20-55y
[3]. A study of close contacts of COVID-19 cases in China [4] found comparable rates of
infection with SARS-CoV-2 in different age groups. A better understanding is needed of the
effect that different age groups play in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic during its
current stage.

In this paper, we apply the methodology in [5,6] to assess the relative roles of different age
groups during the early stage of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Germany using data on
COVID-19 cases provided by the Robert Koch Institute [7]. The idea of that method is that age
groups that have an elevated role in propagating an epidemic due to higher contact rates
and/or susceptibility to infection will have their share among all incident cases increase with
time during the early states of the epidemic, particularly under containment efforts for which
adherence varies between the different age groups. For example, if contact rates in one age
group increase with time relative to another due to lesser adherence, incidence of infection in
the former age group will increase relative to the latter. Additionally, if a given country
comprises several regions with different growth rates for their epidemics, the age group that
drives the incidence of infection in regions with faster growing/larger epidemics will have its
share among all incident cases in the country increase with time. Temporal increase in the
share of a given age group among all cases of infection can be evaluated using the relative risk
(RR) statistic that estimates the ratio of the proportion of a given age group among all
detected (reported) cases of COVID-19 for a later time period vs. an earlier time period. We
note that for a given age group, the ratio between the number of detected COVID-19 cases and
incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (case-detection rate) in that age group may vary with
time due to changes in healthcare-seeking behavior and other factors. To minimize the effect
of relative changes, for the different age groups, in the case-detection rates with time, we
restrict our analysis to individuals aged 10-49y only as symptomatic older adults and younger
children may be more likely to seek medical care/get tested compared to other age groups as
the awareness of the dangers of the epidemic increased with time.

Methods
Data
Data on COVID-19 cases in Germany stratified by week and 5-year age groups can be accessed
through the Robert Koch Institute via the SurvStat@RKI 2.0 application [7]. Those data can be
extracted by creating a query, selecting the attribute to be Disease/Pathogen, selecting the

disease to be Covid-19, and the attributes to display to be 5-year age groups and week of
notification.
Statistical analysis
We select the early period to be weeks 10-11, 2020, and the later period to be weeks 13-14,
2020. Note that at the time of data access (Apr. 4, 2020), data for week 14, 2020 were
incomplete. We include the following eight age groups in our analysis: 10-14y, 15-19y, 20-24y,
25-29y, 30-34y, 35-39y, 40-44y, 45-49y. For each age group 𝑔, let 𝐸(𝑔) be the number of
detected COVID-19 cases in age group 𝑔 during the early period, and 𝐿(𝑔) be the
corresponding number during the later period. The relative risk statistic is

𝑅𝑅 𝑔 =

𝐿(𝑔)
!
!!! 𝐿(ℎ)

𝐸(𝑔)

(1)

!
!!! 𝐸(ℎ)

The observed numbers of detected cases 𝐿(𝑔) and 𝐸(𝑔) in the age group 𝑔 during the later
and early periods are binomially distributed (with the total equaling

!
!!! 𝐿(ℎ)

and

!
!!! 𝐸(ℎ)

correspondingly). Moreover, we assume that the numbers of reported cases are sufficiently
high so that the logarithm ln(𝑅𝑅 𝑔 ) of the relative risk in the age group 𝑔 is approximately
normally distributed [8]. Under this approximation, the 95% confidence interval for 𝑅𝑅(𝑔) is
𝑒𝑥𝑝 ln 𝑅𝑅 𝑔

± 1.96 ∙ 𝑆𝐸 , where ln (𝑅𝑅(𝑔)) is estimated via eq. 1, and the standard error is

𝑆𝐸 =

+
−(
𝐿(𝑔) 𝐸(𝑔)

!
!!! 𝐿(ℎ)

+

)
!
!!! 𝐸(ℎ)

(2)

For each pair of age groups 𝑔1, 𝑔2, comparison of the relative risks 𝑅𝑅(𝑔1) and 𝑅𝑅(𝑔2) is
performed using the odds ratio
𝑂𝑅 𝑔1, 𝑔2 = 𝑅𝑅(𝑔1)/𝑅𝑅 𝑔2

(3)

We note that it follows immediately from eq. 1 that 𝑂𝑅 𝑔1, 𝑔2 equals the odds ratio
!(!!) !(!!)
!(!!) !(!!)

for a COVID-19 case to be in age group 𝑔1 vs. 𝑔2 for the later vs. early period.

Estimates and confidence intervals for pairwise odds ratios are performed using Fisher’s
exact test.

Results
Table 1 shows the estimates for the relative risk 𝑅𝑅 𝑔 for being in a given age group for a
detected COVID-19 case during the later period (weeks 13-14, 2020) vs. early period (weeks
10-11, 2020) for each of the eight age groups used in our analysis. The highest estimate for the
relative risk belongs to individuals aged 20-24y, followed by individuals aged 15-19y, 30-34y
and 25-29y, with estimates of the relative risk for individuals aged over 35y and those aged
10-14y being lower.

relative to any other age group either above 40y or 10-14y for a case to be during the later vs.

Discussion
There is a great deal of uncertainty about the role of different age groups in propagating the
ongoing COVID-19 epidemics in different countries, particularly in light of the current social
distancing measures and testing practices. Some evidence about a larger relative role for
certain age groups vs. other can be obtained by examining temporal changes in the

proportions of different age groups among detected COVID-19 cases, as explained in the 2nd
paragraph of the Introduction. This estimation is done using the relative risk (RR) statistic
that we have employed in our previous work [5,6]. Our results, based on applying this method
to data on COVID-19 cases in Germany provided by the Robert Koch Institute [7], suggest that
individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) have a greater relative role in
propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Germany compared to individuals aged 35-49y and
children aged 10-14y. Some of those differences in relative roles during the ongoing epidemic
may stem from higher mixing related to lesser adherence to social distancing guidelines for
individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y). Further work is needed to assess
those issues in different countries.
Our paper has some limitations. One limitation is that the ratio between the number of
detected COVID-19 cases and incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 cases (case-detection rate) may
vary with time in each age group. We believe that it is unlikely that this phenomenon is more
pronounced for individuals aged 15-34y compared to persons aged 35-49, namely that
increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care or the likelihood of being tested for
individuals aged 15-34y are substantially larger compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 1014y. Therefor, the observed temporal increases in the relative share of individuals aged 1534y among detected COVID-19 cases in persons aged 10-49y should be indicative of the actual
increase in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the
German population. Another limitation is the uncertainty regarding the relation between the
temporal rise in the share of a given age group among SARS-CoV-2 cases and the role that this
age group plays in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Some of the factors supporting that
relation are described in the 2nd paragraph of the Introduction. Additionally, data on mixing
patterns in different age groups during regular times [2], as well as some evidence about the
current social interactions of younger adults/older adolescents suggests that those age groups
are expected to have the largest role in driving the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, which is
indeed supported by our results.
We believe that despite those limitations, our results provide evidence about the role of
younger adults (particularly those aged 20-24y) and older adolescents in driving the current
COVID-19 epidemic in Germany, with that role potentially being related to lesser adherence to

social distancing guidelines. Those results may be relevant to informing social distancing
efforts, particularly for younger adults and older adolescents.
