Abstract

global knowledge flows has become a science policy imperative in most countries.
The paper at hand treats the outbreak of the novel
coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 in January 2020 as an exogenous
shock to the international health science system. Our
main interest is in the structural effects of the shock on
the international health science network. Recent empirical studies have shown that the scientific contribution to
coronavirus related research from individual countries
has been very uneven; often framing it as a scientific
race [5, 6]. [7] investigate the international coronavirus
collaboration network, and find that it has become more
‘elitist’ with the pandemic.
Our empirical analysis adds the insight that the contribution of countries to coronavirus research is closely
related to their contribution in the broader domain of
health sciences, and that the structure of the international coronavirus research network rapidly converged
to the structure of the global, international health science network. Before we discuss the implications of this
finding, let us first turn to the empirical analysis.

How has the science system reacted to the
early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic?
Here we compare the (growing) international
network for coronavirus research with the
broader international health science network.
Our findings show that, before the outbreak,
coronavirus research realized a relatively small
and rather peculiar niche within the global
health sciences. As a response to the pandemic,
the international network for coronavirus research expanded rapidly along the hierarchical
structure laid out by the global health science
network. Thus, in face of the crisis, the global
health science system proved to be structurally
stable yet versatile in research. The observed
versatility supports optimistic views on the role
of science in meeting future challenges. However, the stability of the global core-periphery
structure may be worrying, because it reduces
learning opportunities and social capital of Data

Distinguishing coronavirus related research from noncoronavirus related research, and pre-COVID-19 period
(Jan.–Dec.2019) from COVID-19 period (Jan.–Apr.2020)
yields four categories: 614,141 non-coronavirus, preCOVID-19 papers, 571 coronavirus, pre-COVID-19 papers, 210,171 non-coronavirus, COVID-19 papers, and
12,544 coronavirus, COVID-19 papers.1

research machinery, or crowding out of non-coronavirus
research are not yet visible in this early period.

National scientific production
Next, consider the contribution of individual countries to
coronavirus research. We employ a full-count assignment
scheme – i.e., each paper with at least one affiliation
in a given country counts fully (one) for that country.
The distribution is highly skewed: the 10 most prolific
countries generate 70 percent of coronavirus research
during COVID-19; ranging from the US signing 2,686
to Spain with 381 papers (Fig 1B). All these countries
are big players in the health sciences, but not all bring
in a strong track record in coronavirus research.
So, how important was coronavirus-specific research
capacity compared to general health science capacity in
the early response? Simple linear regressions of coronavirus papers in Jan.– Apr.2020 on pre-pandemic coronavirus and other paper counts provide some indication
(Table 1). All variables in the regression are transformed
into logs, and normalized to zero mean and unit variance
to facilitate direct interpretation of coefficient estimates.
We find that pre-pandemic coronavirus research is highly
(and significantly) correlated with coronavirus research
in January 2020, while other research is not. However,

Results
We first count papers per month (Fig 1A). In the preCOVID-19 period, coronavirus research output is relatively stable, at roughly 50 papers per month. Starting
with the January 2020 outbreak, coronavirus research
grows exponentially up to 8,159 submissions in April
2020. Other research output is stable throughout, at
about 51,000 papers, and even increases slightly with the
pandemic. Apparently, many (male) researchers took
advantage of the lockdown period to finish off research
that piled up already before COVID-19 [8]. Potentially
negative effects of the pandemic due to frictions in the

this pattern reverses within the next three months when
coronavirus research takes off. Note also that variations
in the outcome variable are increasingly well explained,
with R2 from 0.7 in January to 0.9 in April 2020; mostly
due to prior non-coronavirus research.

we increase from zero prior coronavirus papers, (expected) joint coronavirus papers during COVID-19 (the
surface in Fig 1D) also increases. Yet, it is evident that
bi-national collaboration on coronavirus related research
after the shock largely reflects bi-national collaboration
on non-coronavirus research before the shock.
Consequently, countries’ network centrality in the
coronavirus research network aligns with their centrality in the overall health science network. We capture
network centrality through (normalized) s-core decomposition [9]. The s-core ranges from 0 for isolates in
the network, to 1 for (highest) core members. Fig 1E
provides the monthly s-cores on the non-coronavirus network (left panel), coronavirus network (middle panel),
and the difference of s-cores in coronavirus and noncoronavirus networks (right panel). The figure shows
the 60 most central countries in the non-coronavirus
network and applies that same ordering across all three
panels. The remaining countries are highly peripheral
in the considered networks. The left panel shows that
the global network hierarchy is very stable. The core is
formed by (mostly large) countries of the global north,
China being the exception. Centrality in the coronavirus
network is more dynamic (middle panel). Pre-COVID19, most countries are not involved in coronavirus related collaborations and, hence, in the extreme periphery
(white). The core of the coronavirus network includes
only a few countries leading other health sciences. Saudi
Arabia stands out as it is part of the core in the coronavirus network, but peripheral in the overall health
science network. (Variations in core membership over
time may be explained by lower research activity overall
which leads to more erratic signals.) After the shock,
the structure of the coronavirus network shifts rapidly
towards the hierarchy in health science at large. This
is easily seen in the right panel that shows the difference between the s-core centrality in the coronavirus
and non-coronavirus network. Prior to the shock, s-core
differences range from -1 in dark blue (for countries at
the extreme periphery in the coronavirus network and
in the core in the other network), over 0 in white (same
s-core in both networks), up to 1 in red (for countries
in the coronavirus network core and peripheral in the
non-coronavirus network). After the shock, the global
core rapidly takes its role in coronavirus related research,
and so does the global periphery (all countries appear
in light colors with an s-core difference of around zero
in April 2020).
Fig 2 pictures the networks in form of adjacency matrices. In order to facilitate a comparison across networks,
adjacency matrices of the pre-pandemic coronavirus network (A), pre-pandemic non-coronavirus network (C),
and pandemic coronavirus network (D) are all ordered
by eigenvector centrality in (C).
The pre-pandemic coronavirus network (A) is relatively sparse and best described by a block model (B):
A regional middle east community and a community
of mostly developed countries, connected through USA,
China, and Saudi Arabia. The block model is obtained
by minimizing the absolute difference of the number of
papers in logs over blocks. This finding is robust to alternative algorithms. Essentially the same (community)

By the same token, countries take rapidly very similar
positions in rankings on coronavirus papers as they do
in rankings on other health papers (see Fig 1C). We
calculate the rank correlation coefficient τX of [10]. It
is similar to Kendall’s τ , but handles ties the same
as dominant relationships (i.e. entering 1 and not 0
in the dominance matrix). This is favorable in case
of many ties in the rankings, as we have in corona preCovid-19 research, but does not really change the results.
The 90 percent confidence interval around τX has been
obtained through a traditional jackknife, or leave-oneout, approach (see e.g. [11]). Fig 1C shows the result.
Until the outbreak in January 2020 (vertical dashed line
in Fig 1C) rank correlations are rather low at around
0.2. After the outbreak, the (monthly) scientific output
of countries in corona aligns with non-corona research
output until a (high) correlation of 0.8 in April 2020.
We summarize the first part of the analysis. Before
the pandemic, leading countries in the health sciences
have not necessarily led coronavirus research. Within a
few months after the COVID-19 shock, leading countries
in the health sciences also led coronavirus research. The
second part of the analysis establishes the same dynamic
for the international collaboration networks.

International scientific collaboration
We construct international scientific collaboration networks based on co-authorship of papers in our sample. A
node corresponds to a country. Edge weights correspond
to the number of joint papers (full-accounting scheme).
First, we consider link formation. Are prior collaborations on coronavirus research (i.e. same topic), or any
prior ties (i.e. different topics) replicated for coronavirus
research during the pandemic? Fig 1D provides some
indication. The surface plot is obtained from a local
regression with least-squares cross-validated bandwidths
for the local constant estimator. It shows the expected
(log of) joint coronavirus papers during COVID-19, conditional on (log of) joint coronavirus and non-coronavirus
papers pre-COVID-19. Looking at Fig 1D, we first note
that most country-pairs (dots) had no pre-COVID-19
joint coronavirus research. Their number of joint coronavirus papers during COVID-19 increases with the
number of other joint papers before the pandemic. As

structure transpires from hierarchical community detection on the weighted pre-pandemic coronavirus network
using the OSLOM [12] as well as the LOUVAIN [13]
algorithm.
In contrast, we find that the pre-pandemic, noncoronavirus network (C) corresponds to a nested-split
graph. A nested-split graph is a specific type of a hierarchical network, in which the most central node connects
to all other nodes, and less central nodes connect to subsets of alters of more central nodes. Nested-split graphs
emerge in network games where payoffs are strategic
complements in effort levels [14], which is a reasonable assumption for science networks. The coronavirus network
after the shock (D) closely resembles the non-coronavirus
network before the shock (C). The correlation coefficient
(E) of the (monthly) coronavirus and non-coronavirus
adjacency matrices (in logs) confirms that convergence.
All correlations are highly significant; based on a QAP
test that creates a null distribution through re-labeling
of nodes while maintaining the structure of the networks [15].

lated research mostly picks up established structures of
the broader, globalized health sciences. Thus, we conjecture that coronavirus research during the pandemic
will further sustain, not break with, long-term trends in
international collaborations. The pandemic feeds into
an ongoing global stratification in science that reduces
systematically learning opportunities and social capital
of scientifically peripheral countries. Policy should therefore aim at a more inclusive science landscape — not
only during crises, but even more in its ‘normal mode
of operation’.
