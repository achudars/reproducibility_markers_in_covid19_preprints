Abstract
Pavelka et al. (Science, Reports, 7 May 2021) claim that a single round of population-wide
antigen testing in Slovakia reduced the observed COVID-19 prevalence by 58%, and that it
played a substantial role in curbing the pandemic. We argue that this estimate, which is
based on incorrect assumptions, is exaggerated, and that the relief was short-lived with little
effect on mitigating the pandemic.

Pavelka et al.1 analyze the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented
in Slovakia in the fall of 2020 (see Fig.1 for the timeline) as a response to a worsening
COVID-19 epidemiological situation2. They estimate that one round of population-wide
antigen testing coupled with standard NPIs lowered the (observed) prevalence by 58%, and
they extrapolate that repeated mass testing decreases the prevalence by the same factor in
each round. We propose that: (i) effects of the mass testing were much lower and temporary;
(ii) their repeatability is questionable; and (iii) other externalities should be considered to
evaluate long-term effects.
Some problems stem from an incorrect use of terminology. Pavelka et al. define “observed
infection prevalence” as the proportion of positive results in mass antigen testing. They use
this term interchangeably with the term “prevalence” (proportion of infected individuals in the
population3), even in the study title and abstract.
The estimate of a 58% decrease in observed prevalence in counties with multiple rounds of
mass testing compares the test positivity on two successive weekends. However, the two
population samples are influenced by multiple asymmetrical biases. First, individuals positive
in the first round of testing (T1) and their whole households were instructed to quarantine
and not to participate in the second round (T2), which caused a significant underestimation
of prevalence in T2. This effect is also seen in the microsimulation model of Pavelka et al.,
where prevalence and test positivity are similar in the pilot round (T0), but they differ
markedly in subsequent rounds (Fig 2a). A similar discrepancy is also shown in Fig.3b of
Pavelka et al. (green line vs. symbols). Second, self-selected participants were motivated by
lockdown exemptions, which were a necessary inducement to participate4. Experience from
T1 possibly decreased participation in T2 for individuals suspecting their own positivity to
avoid loss of income from a quarantine of the entire household. Third, many residents of
counties exempted from T2 needed a negative test for commuting and were tested in other
participating locations, where they influenced the positivity5.
Moreover, the authors consider the value of 58% a “robust” estimate (95% confidence
interval 57-58%), even though they acknowledge their inability to explain a significant
variance among counties, which ranged from 47% to 70% in the counties with at least 50
thousand participants.

Pavelka et al. use mass antigen testing both as an intervention and as its efficacy
measurement, which is often a source of unforeseen biases6. The fact that T2 was only
implemented in selected counties provides a quasi-experimental setup to estimate mass
testing efficacy. The RT-qPCR incidence (measured independently from the intervention)
was reduced by 40% in counties with T2 between the week before T2 and the second week
after, compared to a reduction by 22% in counties without T2 (Fig.1a) – a 23% reduction
attributable to the mass testing. Kahanec et al.7 corrected for biases stemming from
differences in the effectiveness of antigen testing in low- and high-prevalence areas,
estimating 25-30% reduction over the same period.
This exaggeration of prevalence decrease is independently confirmed by other data (Fig.1b):
hospital admissions (10-day lag after infection8) decreased by about 30% from their peak
(hardly the “sharp decrease in new admissions”1), and excess deaths (15-20 day lag9)
decreased by about 24%, both consistent with a prevalence reduction of 20-30%. In both
cases, the temporary two-week decline was followed by a long-term steady increase.
Pavelka et al. use a microsimulation to model prevalence in simulated populations under
different parameter settings. They assume 100% test sensitivity, in stark contrast with the
well-documented lower sensitivity of antigen tests10. Moreover, no simulation scenario takes
into account the increase of mobility after T1 (Fig.1c). Changing these assumptions alone
dramatically reduces the cumulative effects of mass testing from 90% to 55% over three
rounds (Fig.2b). The strong effects presented in Fig.3 of Pavelka et al. depend on unrealistic
assumptions about test sensitivity and social implications (ignoring a false sense of security
after negative tests).
Several claims of Pavelka et al. are based on epidemic growth of 4.4% per day at the time of
T1, estimated from the RT-qPCR incidence. Regrettably, the details of the computation of
this number, or of the 70% decrease in prevalence compared to unmitigated growth, are not
provided by the authors. However, a nationwide improvement had been observed already
before T1 (Fig.1a,b,d), suggesting a much lower epidemic growth (or even decline) at the
time, which makes the basis of this computation unfounded.
Finally, Pavelka et al. conclude that mass testing likely had “a substantial effect in curbing
the pandemic in Slovakia”. Yet, the effects were short-lived. Mobility increased steadily
starting from T1, indicating changes in social behavior (Fig.1c). The long-term increase of
RT-qPCR incidence began during T2, the positivity of routine antigen tests and the average

viral load in positive RT-qPCR tests began to increase several days later (Fig.1d). Hospital
admissions started to rise two weeks after T2, followed by a steady increase in excess
deaths (Fig.1b), eventually resulting in overloaded hospitals, a 4-month lockdown from
January 2021, and the world’s foremost position in reported deaths per capita11 in February
2021.
The first mass antigen testing in Slovakia was organized under unique circumstances
difficult to repeat on the same scale. It was facilitated by an extensive involvement of the
army and municipalities, minute-to-minute media coverage, the commitment of numerous
medical personnel and volunteers (including international aid), and social effects of
participants being tested simultaneously. Spontaneously emerging social pressure likely
increased not only testing attendance, but also observance of the quarantine. However, all
this led to only a temporary decrease in incidence, much lower than estimated by Pavelka et
al. Such a mobilization cannot be conceived as a viable long-term strategy, which has been
proven in Slovakia itself, as subsequent population-wide antigen testing in 2021 failed to
produce anticipated results.
Based on these arguments, it is questionable whether mass testing in Slovakia should serve
as a model for other countries.

Figure 1. Temporal evolution of epidemiological indicators in Slovakia between October 1 and
December 31, 2020 and their relation to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Timeline of
NPIs introduced between October 12 and November 8. I1 (October 12): limiting social contacts
(closures of schools, restaurants, cultural venues, sport and recreational facilities, churches, etc.,
mandatory masks outdoors); I2 (October 24): nation-wide “stay-at-home” order; T0 (October 23-25):
pilot mass testing in four counties; T1 (October 31-November 1): nation-wide first round of mass
testing; T2 (November 7-8): second round of mass testing in 45 counties (out of 80) with positivity at
least 0.7%; T3 (November 21-22): third round of mass testing in 447 municipalities with positivity at
least 1% in T1 or T2. For all indicators, moving averages centered in the middle are shown to smooth
out day-to-day variation. For mobility data, a 3-day window is used, all other indicators use a 7-day
window. (a) RT-qPCR test incidence per 10,000 people. Total incidence for all counties (black),
incidence for counties with both T1 and T2, but without T0 (red), and for countries with T1 only (green)
is shown. Nation-wide incidence started to decline two days before T1. (b) Hospital admissions and
excess deaths. Hospital admissions declined even before T1 (from October 25 to November 2). After
T1, both indicators declined for a short period, resuming a sharp upward trend by the end of
November. (c) Mobility relative to October 1, 2020. Data from Google mobility (retail, stations),
Apple (driving, transit), and Waze suggest a systematic increase of mobility in November 2020. (d)
Positivity of RT-qPCR tests and quantification cycle (Cq) values. Cq values were reported only
on a portion of the tests which were performed by Unilabs diagnostic laboratories. The average viral
load and the proportion of the RT-qPCR tests with high viral loads (Cq<25) both started to decrease in
October before T1. Lower viral loads are indicative of lower Re12.

Figure 2. Impacts of methodology and model parameters on prevalence reduction in the
microsimulation by Pavelka et al. The microsimulation presented in Fig.3 of Pavelka et al. based on
the situation in a representative county with the pilot round and two additional rounds of mass testing.
All values presented here were obtained with the code and parameters provided by Pavelka et al. in
their supplementary material. (a) Comparison of disease prevalence and antigen test positivity
(observed prevalence according to Pavelka et al.). The results correspond to the scenario with
three rounds of testing with extended measures (Re=1) with full household compliance as presented
in Fig.3b of Pavelka et al. In the pilot round, test positivity is a good estimate of the disease
prevalence. In the following rounds, systematic biases, such as quarantine of infected household
members, result in testing positivity significantly underestimating the disease prevalence. This leads
to a systematic overestimation of NPI effects. In particular, test positivity shows 67% reduction
between the pilot round and the 1st round, while the real prevalence only decreases by 28%. (b)
Prevalence two weeks after the second round under various scenarios. The microsimulation
model is very sensitive to parameters that in Pavelka et al. simulations were set as unreasonably
favorable for mass antigen testing. Bar 1: Prevalence in the base scenario with extended measures
(Re=1) and no mass testing as presented in Fig.3b of Pavelka et al. Bar 2: Original simulation, mass
testing with 100% test sensitivity, full household compliance led to the average reduction of
prevalence by 54% per simulation round. However, the code of Pavelka et al. mistakenly performed
testing on individuals below 10 and above 65 years, thus mistakenly performing approximately 37%
more tests compared to the model county. Bar 3: Simulation results after correcting this issue. Bar 4:
Changing test sensitivity to 70% instead of 100%, a value considered as realistic by Pavelka et al. Bar
5: Changing test sensitivity to 50%. Bars 6,7: People were motivated to participate in the mass testing
by relief from extended measures as demonstrated by the increase in mobility in Figure 1A. By adding
gradual growth of Re from 1 before the pilot round to 1.15 one week after, the effect of mass testing is
significantly reduced again.
