Abstract
In a given country, the cumulative death toll of the first wave of the COVID-19
epidemic follows a sigmoid curve as a function of time. In most cases, the curve is well
described by the Gompertz function, which is characterized by two essential parameters, the initial growth rate and the decay rate as the first epidemic wave subsides.
These parameters are determined by socioeconomic factors and the countermeasures
to halt the epidemic. The Gompertz model implies that the total death toll depends
exponentially, and hence very sensitively, on the ratio between these rates. The remarkably different epidemic curves for the first epidemic wave in Sweden and Norway
and many other countries are classified and discussed in this framework, and their
usefulness for the planning of mitigation strategies is discussed.

Introduction

At the time of writing, early August 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is expanding exponentially in many countries, particularly in the tropics and the southern hemisphere. On the
other hand, in Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America, the first wave of infection is
mostly over. In some countries, e.g., the United States, Israel, Iran, and Spain, a second
and stronger wave develops. For the first wave, the general shape of the epidemic curves,
the daily number of confirmed cases or COVID-19 related deaths, is one of rapid growth
followed by a slower decay. However, even though this general characteristic is ubiquitous,
the total death toll per million inhabitants in comparable countries varies by more than an
order of magnitude. For instance, by August 5, 2020, Sweden had registered 569 deaths per
million, while neighboring Norway only 47.
The debate about the causes of this pronounced variability between countries has involved
a plethora of explanations [1] based on correlation techniques such as multiple regression
[2], or on models that involve statistical modelling of the dynamics of transmission [3].
Suggested predictors (explaining variables) in such analyses have encompassed demographic,
socioeconomic, and health related characteristics, and strength and timing of border closures
1

and social distancing measures. Some success in assessing the effect of non-pharmaceutical
interventions in 11 European countries was obtained in [3], and the effect of social distancing
measures in Sweden, Denmark and Norway was studied by a considerably simpler approach
in [4]. The three countries are similar in terms of health care, language, culture, climate,
economy, and institutional framework. Moreover, due to the simultaneous import of infected
cases via ski tourists returning from Austria and Italy in early March 2020, it is plausible that
community spread of the disease started at approximately the same time in these countries.
On the other hand, while Norway and Denmark followed the general lockdown of most of
the European Union countries on March 12, 2020, Sweden followed a different path, largely
using voluntary measures [5].
On a world scale, cross-country comparative analysis is extremely challenging for at least
two reasons. One is that the relevant predictors vary across the world and may attain an
unmanageable number. Another is that the same problem could be pertain to the predictands
(explained variable). How do we best describe the impacts of the disease in a way that
allows comparison between countries in different parts of the world? Some studies employ
regression analysis to a sample containing the majority of the world’s countries, but consider
the accumulated COVID-19 cases and/or deaths up to a certain date as predictand [6]. This
variable may be very misleading, however, since the virus was not introduced simultaneously
in all countries. In principle, we need to predict and compare the full epidemic curves
across countries, but in order to extract information from from such comparison, we need
a simplified characterization of these curves, i.e., we need to reduce the information in the
curves to a few numbers. This paper is about how we can obtain and make use of such a
characterization.
Our main finding is that the epidemic curves for COVID-19 related deaths for most
countries with a reliable reporting system are surprisingly well described by the so-called
Gompertz growth model [7]. This model contains only two essential free parameters to be
determined by the data. These parameters determine the initial relative growth rate of the
number of daily deaths and the decay rate of this number as the first epidemic wave comes
to an end. The mathematical properties of the Gompertz model imply that the total death
toll in the first wave is given by the exponential of the ratio between these two rates. This
ratio can be considered as a measure of the skewness of the curve for daily deaths. The
exponential dependence implies that the death toll is strongly dependent on this skewness
parameter. Countries with rapid initial growth and slow later decay suffer the higher death
toll, but there are variations among countries with a similar number of deaths. For instance,
while Spain experienced very fast initial growth followed by a rapid decay due to a very
forceful lockdown, Swedish death numbers rose and decayed considerably slower. Other
countries, like Norway, experienced slower initial growth than Sweden, and faster decay, and
thereby obtained death numbers one order of magnitude lower. Since the initial growth rate
in Norway was so much lower than in Spain, Norway could obtain these results with slower
decay, i.e., with a considerably milder lockdown, than Spain.
In this paper, we make a detailed comparison of epidemic curves for Sweden and Norway,
including computation and plotting the respective time evolution of the relative growth

2

rates and time-dependent reproduction numbers. We further fit the Gompertz model to the
epidemic curves (deaths) for a large number of countries that have completed the first wave,
and plot the model parameters in a diagram highlighting their differences. The two rates
are predictands that correlate in different ways to various predictors of the epidemic curve,
and via these predictands they determine the total death toll in the first wave. Regressions
that determine the coefficients of these predictors will be useful in the design of optimal
mitigation strategies for upcoming waves of the epidemic.

Materials and Methods
Data

Data employed in this paper are downloaded from Our World in Data [8]. Their data for
COVID-19 related deaths are retrieved from the European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control. As explained by the COVID-19 Health System Response Monitor [9], figures
may vary among countries and may complicate cross-country analysis. This problem is most
serious for the headline figures presenting the most recent day-to-day data. We use data
published at the end of July, but only data up to the first week of July. In Section 4 we will
discuss the implications of such uncertainties for the conclusions of the analysis.
The official figures from China suffer from 40% discontinuous increase in death numbers
on April 17. The official explanation is that home deaths before that date were included. In
our analysis, we account for this by adjusting the numbers before April 17 by a factor 1.4,
thus removing the discontinuity.

2.2

The Gompertz model

The Gompertz model is a special case of the class of logistic growth models [10]. This general
class are solutions J(t) to the nonlinear, separable differential equation
dJ
= γ(J) J,
dt

(1)

where t is the time coordinate and J is a quantity undergoing monotonic growth that saturates at the carrying capacity J∞ in the limit t → ∞. In the Gompertz model the instantaneous relative growth rate γ(J) = dt J/J = dt (ln J) is (see Appendix A),
 
J∞
γ(J) = γ∞ ln

and Eq. (1) can be integrated to yield

ln J(t) = ln J∞ − ln

or equivalently,

J(t) = J∞

exp (−γ∞ t)
.

(4)

Note that in this limit γ(J) diverges as J → 0, so Eq. (1) should be understood as an initial
value problem with J(0) = J0 and an initial growth rate
 
J∞
.
(5)
γ0 = γ∞ ln
J0
The logarithmic form of Eq. (3) shows that the Gompertz model describes a growth where
the logarithm of J converges exponentially towards the limit ln J∞ , i.e., the difference J∞ −J
decays with the decay rate γ∞ . The growth curve is completely determined by the initial
value J0 , the carrying capacity J∞ , and the asymptotic decay rate γ∞ . These features make
it natural to plot J(t) in a logarithmic plot.
From Eq. (3) we have ln(J∞ /J) = exp (−γ∞ t) ln(J∞ /J0 ), and Eq. (2) then yields γ as a
function of time,
γ(t) = γ0 exp (−γ∞ t).
(6)
This is an alternative way of expressing equations (1) and (2), which shows that the relative
growth rate as a function of time decays exponentially with rate γ∞ for all t > 0 and is a
remarkable result since it implies that γ(t) depends only on γ0 and γ∞ . Eq. (5) shows that
γ0 is determined by the three model parameters J0 , J∞ , and γ∞ , and hence can replace any
of these as a model parameter. The parameters J∞ , and γ∞ are more fundamental than the
others, however, since the latter depend on the choice of the time origin. Eq. (4) implies
that a translation of the time variable, t → t − t0 , corresponding to a shift of the time origin,
leads to a shift of the initial value; J0 → J∞ (J0 /J∞ )exp (−γ∞ t0 ) , and Eq. (6) leads to a shift
of the initial growth rate; γ0 → γ0 exp (γ∞ t0 ). A natural choice is to choose the time origin
to be the first day the observed value of J exceeds one death per million inhabitants.
In the fitting procedure we do not fix J0 = 1, thus allowing the modeled value J0 to
be slightly different from one and from the observed value at t = 0. Eq. (5) can now be
rewritten to give us the total death toll in terms of the rates γ0 and γ∞ ,
 
γ0
,
(7)
J∞ = J0 exp
γ∞
where J0 is close to one. The significance of Eq. (7) is that the accumulated death toll
over the first epidemic wave depends exponentially on the ratio of the growth rate γ0 at the
time when the number of deaths exceeds one per million, to the asymptotic decay rate γ∞
as the epidemic burns out. A more asymmetric epidemic curve; rapid rise and slow decay,
intuitively leads to a larger number of deaths, but the exponential dependence on the ratio
of rates suggests that the sensitivity of the death toll with respect to countermeasures is
surprisingly high.
The monotonically increasing sigmoid shape of J(t) suggest that it models the evolution
of accumulated quantities like the cumulative number of infected individuals or cumulative

derivative dt J. Fig. 1(a) shows an example of J(t) given by the Gompertz function, and

is the relative growth rate of the daily number dt J which is a skew, bell-shaped function. Γ(t) is a monotonically decreasing function starting out at the positive value Γ0 =

negative value −γ∞ as t → ∞. From Eq. (8) we find an alternative to Eq. (7)

(10)

Thus, we observe that the total death toll depends exponentially on the ratio Γ0 /γ∞ , which
is the absolute value of the ratio of the initial and the final slopes of the curve in Fig. 1(b).
Hence this ratio represents a measure of the skewness of this curve.
The parameters J∞ and γ∞ are intrinsic in the sense that they do not depend on the time
origin, while γ0 and Γ0 do exhibit such a dependence. This is reflected by the inconvenient
fact that the estimated J0 is different for each country and is determined by the choice we
have made for the time origin (the first day the number of deaths per million exceeds one).
For comparison of countries, it would be more correct to use the growth rate γ1 at the time
t1 when J(t1 ) = 1. This growth rate is found by putting J = 1 in Eqs. (2) and (8), yielding
γ1 = γ∞ ln J∞ , Γ1 = γ1 − γ∞ ,

The evolution of the reproduction number R(t)

In Appendix A the Gompertz model is derived heuristically from the SIR dynamical model
with some auxiliary assumptions. In the SIR model, the variable J(t) is the cumulative
number of infections in a country’s population. This quantity cannot be observed directly,
because the majority of infected individuals are never tested for the virus. The number of
cases confirmed by tests is not a reliable proxy, because testing regimes change over the
course of the epidemic, and vary among countries as well. The number of COVID-19 related
deaths is also unreliable as a proxy, since infection death rates vary from one country to
another, but as a measure of the time development of the cumulative number of infections
it is probably the best statistic that is generally available. In this paper, we are interested
in the overall shape of the epidemic curve, and not the time for epidemic onset or details
depending on the distribution of the time between infection and death. For most countries
the shape of the curves for infections and deaths are very similar in the sense that the former
can be obtained by a trivial time translation and re-scaling of the latter
J(t) → sd J(t + td ),

(14)

where the scaling factor sd in Scandinavia is of the order 150 and the time lag between infection and death td is about 20 days. After performing this re-scaling of the curve of observed
deaths, we interpret the result as the curve of cumulative infection cases that appears in the
SIR model (see Appendix A). In that model we encounter the time-dependent reproduction
number R(t), which is more commonly used in epidemiology than the instantaneous relative
growth rate γ(t). Consider now the the linearized SIR equations (30) and (31) for the cumulative number of infected, J(t), and the number of active transmitters of the infection, I(t),
as described in Appendix A. Introducing the reproduction number R(t) = β(t)/α, these
equations take the form
dJ
= αRI,

Here, the reproduction number is typically reduced with time due to countermeasures and
the gradual removal of superspreaders from the susceptible population, while the recovery

written,

initial condition. In the asymptotic limit t → ∞, Γ(t) → −γ∞ and R(t) → R∞ , where

From Eq. (17) we find that for small t the growth rate is γ(t) ≈ α(R(t) − 1), hence for the

Fitting procedure

The essential methodological idea in this work is to fit a mathematical model for the epidemic
curve to an observed time series; in this case the cumulative number of COVID-19 related
deaths. This curve has a sigmoid shape with near-exponential growth in the initial growth
phase. In such situations a usual least-square fitting procedure will give a poor representation
of the initial growth because large relative errors will give small contributions to the absolute
least-square error. Much better representation is obtained by fitting the logarithm of the
model to the logarithm of the data. This is what we do here, by fitting the function for ln J(t)
given by Eq. (3) to the logarithm of the cumulative death per million time series starting
at the first day this number exceeds one. We use the built-in fitting routine FindFit in
Mathematica 12.0.0.0, which employs a least-square optimation to estimate the parameters
J∞ , γ∞ , and J0 .
We have typically used about 100 days of the time series for this fitting, but have adjusted
this manually for each country to make sure that we only include the first wave of the
epidemic. We have only included countries which have clearly completed a first wave, so
that we can reliably estimate the decay rate γ∞ . For this reason, we have not analyzed
many countries in the tropics or the southern hemisphere. The data for the 73 countries we
have analyzed, and the fits to them, are shown in Figs. 9-14. The fits are surprisingly good,
and demonstrate the usefulness of the Gompertz model to give an analytical representation
of these data.

Results

In this section we first present a detailed comparison of Sweden and Norway in order to highlight some of the useful information that can be drawn from the analytical representation of
the epidemic curves through the fitted Gompertz functions. Next we estimate the Gompertz
model parameters from 73 countries and classify them in terms of total death toll and ratio
between rates of initial growth and later decay.

3.1

Epidemic curves of Sweden and Norway

Fig. 2(a) shows the development of cumulative deaths per million inhabitants in Norway
and Sweden in a logarithmic plot, and the corresponding fitted Gompertz function. Sweden
data converge to a total death toll which is more the ten times higher than that of Norway.
The relative growth rates γ(t) = dt ln J(t) given as the slope of each curve are plotted in
Fig. 2(b). Eq. (6) shows that these growth rates decay exponentially from an initial value
γ0 towards zero at a rate γ∞ . Observe that the gap between Swedish and Norwegian death
numbers continues to grow throughout April and May (see also the growth of the ratio of
these numbers in Fig. 4(b)), consistent with the higher Swedish growth rate throughout this
period.
Fig. 3(a) shows the derivative dt J(t) for Sweden an Norway in logarithmic plot. The
growth rate Γ(t) of this derivative is the slope of these curves, and is plotted in fig. 3(b).
It is given by Eq. (8) and decays exponentially from Γ0 = γ0 − γ∞ to −γ∞ . As shown by
Eq. (12) the total death toll J∞ is determined by the ratio of the initial and final slope, i.e.,
the ratio Γ1 /γ∞ which characterizes the skewness of the curve. The steeper initial growth
in Sweden signified through the higher Γ1 obviously contributes to the total death toll, but

so does also also the lower rate on the decaying slope in June and July.
Before we try to quantify these contributions, let us look at the reconstructed evolution
of the reproduction number R(t) for the two countries by solving Eq. (18) with Γ(t) shifted
17 days backwards in time to account for the average delay between infection and death, and
α−1 = 5 days representing the average infectious period. The initial value R0 is given by
Eq. (20). The 17-days delay is uncertain, so the shape of R0 -curves shown in Fig. 4(a) may
be more accurate than the absolute dating. The important observation is that the relatively
small, but consistent, difference between the reproduction number in Sweden and Norway
throughout the entire epidemic wave has been sufficient to produce a tenfold higher number
of deaths in Sweden.
Fig. 4(b) shows that the ratio of the cumulative deaths in Sweden and Norway increases
strongly throughout the entire epidemic wave, which indicates that the higher R in Sweden
during the decaying phase has had a strong effect on the total death toll, i.e., people have
continued dying in Sweden in May and June, long after the death rate was close to zero in
Norway.
Further insight into the differences of the epidemic curves between countries can be
obtained by the graphics demonstrated in Fig. 5. Here we have marked the point (Γ1 , γ∞ )
for Sweden and Norway and represented the function ln J∞ = 1 + Γ1 /γ∞ in a density plot.
The diagonal lines represent isolines for constant J∞ . We observe that Sweden is located on
the iso-line where J∞ = 520 and Norway on the line where J∞ = 49. In addition, it is seen,
as already noticed, that Sweden exhibits a considerably higher initial growth rate Γ1 than
Norway, and also a lower decay rate γ∞ . The main value of the diagram, however, is that it
allows us to explore the effect on the death toll of hypothetical action in the two countries
that did not materialize.
Judging from the final death tolls, the Swedish path does not seem as a very attractive
option. But what if the countries had chosen to follow the Swedish path initially, with strong
growth in the early phase and then followed the Norwegian path with fast decay in the late
phase? The end state would then be the purple cross which is located on the isoline with

totally 224 deaths per million. Another option would be to follow the Norwegian path with
slow initial growth followed by the Swedish path with slow decay. This would lead to the
blue cross which lies on the 82 deaths per million line. This suggests that reduction of the
initial growth is the most effective way to bring the total death toll in the first wave down.
More precisely, the lower initial growth in Norway reduced the number of deaths by a factor
six compared to Sweden, and the faster decay in the late phase by nearly another factor two.
It should be mentioned that the hypothetical paths discussed above may not be realizable
in practice since there may be dynamical constraints that do not allow Γ1 and γ∞ to be
varied independently of each other. However, as described in Section 3.2 by studying a large
number of countries we find a wide range of possible states in the (Γ1 , γ∞ )-plane, and no
sign of “forbidden” areas within this range.

3.2

Analysis of data from 73 countries

Figs. (6) shows the same as Fig. (5), where the data for Sweden and Norway has been
supplemented by 71 other countries. The epidemic curves and their Gompertz fits are shown
in Fig. (9) – (14). Fig. (6) shows that the death toll J∞ in the first wave covers a range of
more than two orders of magnitude, from just above 3 in China to more than 800 in Belgium.
Ordered by increasing death toll (see Fig. 7(c) for the full ordered list), we have identified a
few countries in the legend. China, New Zealand, Slovakia, South Korea and Japan belong
to the group of countries with less than 10 deaths per million. In the group with ∼ 102
deaths, we have Iceland, Norway, Finland, Austria, Denmark, and Germany. And in group
with ∼ 103 deaths, United States, Sweden, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, and Belgium.
From Fig. 7(c) one could be tempted to conclude that the epidemic curves are very
similar for countries with similar death toll, but Fig. 6 and Figs. 7(a,b) show that this is
not so. The magnitudes of the growth rates vary considerably among countries with similar
J∞ = exp (Γ1 /γ∞ ). Some countries within one group have a rapid initial rise Γ1 which is

compensated by a rapid fall (high rate γ∞ ) in the late phase, while others have a slow initial
growth and a slower decay, resulting in approximately the same death toll. As mentioned
in the introduction, Sweden experienced considerably slower initial growth than Spain, but
also achieved much slower decay than Spain due to weak measures to contain the epidemic
compared to Spain’s radical lock-down. The result is that the two countries are located very
close to each other in Fig. 7(c), but are strongly separated along the same J∞ isoline in Fig.
6.
Mathematically, Fig. 6 locates each country in a 3D plot which specifies the three Gompertz parameters (Γ1 , Γ∞ , ln J∞ ). Hence, it contains all the information contained in the
Gompertz description of the epidemic curve. Fig. 7 can be conceived as the projections of
the points in Fig. 6 onto the three axes.

Discussion

The main purpose of this paper has been to extract objective information from the epidemic
curves for COVID-19 related deaths on the country level by utilizing the observational fact
that the curves for the first wave are quite accurately represented by the Gompertz function
for many countries of interest. The results may be subject to different interpretations and

raise many questions that we cannot answer in this paper. In this section, we will limit
ourselves to present some subjective views on why the Gompertz model seems to fit these
data so well and some viewpoints on the information presented in Figs. 6 and 7.

4.1

How to interpret the Gompertz model?

By taking the time derivative of Eq. (3), the Gompertz model can be written in the form
 
J∞
dt J
= dt ln J(t) = γ∞ ln
exp(−γ∞ t) = γ0 exp(−γ∞ t),
(22)
γ(t) =
J
J0
which is identical to Eq. (6). The relative growth rate γ represents how much one unit
of J grows per unit time. It is closely related to the reproduction number R, which can
be interpreted as the average number of new infections caused by one infected individual.
If the disease transmission mechanisms remain constant over time, including the density of
susceptible individuals, γ will remain constant, and the growth of J(t) will be exponential. If
a large fraction of the population becomes infected, and eventually immune, herd immunity
will appear as a nonlinearity in the SIR-equations (see Appendix A). This effect has not yet
appeared on the country level in the COVID-19 epidemic, so changes in the transmission
mechanism must cause a reduction of γ(t) over time. One effect that is seen in all epidemics
even without societal action is that individuals who are particularly active in spreading
the disease (so-called super-spreaders) catch the disease early and are removed from the
susceptible population. As time goes, this reduces the effective reproduction number and
γ. In addition, society acts in complex ways to resist the disease. If the total effect of this
resistance on the rate of change of γ is proportional γ itself (which is a common property of
a dissipative force), the equation for γ would take the form
dγ
= −ηγ,
dt

(23)

which is what we will find by taking the time derivative of Eq. (22) with the resistance
η = γ∞ . Thus, we have arrived at a straightforward interpretation of the Gompertz model
as a mathematical description of an unstable system where a quantity J(t) naturally grows
exponentially in the absence of dissipation. The dissipative force in this system does not
act on J(t) itself, but rather on its growth rate. Society does not take action in response to
the death toll itself but to its growth. A physics analog could be the force on an electrically
charged body that emits electromagnetic radiation. This force resists the acceleration, the
rate of change of the velocity, unlike an ordinary friction force, which resists the velocity.

4.2

How to interpret Figs. 6 and 7?

The interpretation of Figs. 6 and 7 is sensitive to how the sample of countries has been
selected. A complete picture will emerge as more countries complete the first wave. We had
excluded countries that are not well beyond the first peak in daily deaths, or countries that
14

had entered a second wave much before the first was completed. Countries that have not
reached the first peak are Argentina, India, South Africa, and Colombia, and countries that
have entered an early second wave are Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Chile.
We have also excluded countries that we strongly suspect have unreliable or irregular
reporting or epidemic curves that, by visual inspection, are not well fitted by a sigmoid
function. However, we emphasize that no country has been excluded from the sample based
on the results of the analysis.
The relative effect of the two parameters on the total death toll is seen by traversing the
sample in Fig. 6 in the vertical and horizontal direction. We observe that the distribution in
the γ∞ -direction is much wider for small Γ1 than for large Γ1 . In the vertical direction, J∞
varies two orders of magnitude among countries with Γ1 < 0.15, i.e., there is a high variability
of the decay rate γ∞ among countries with low initial growth. Some countries, like China,
New Zealand, Slovakia, South Korea, and Japan, have taken strong action throughout the
first wave, despite low initial growth of the death numbers. On the other hand, other
countries like Brazil, have used relatively low initial growth as an excuse for non-action,
resulting in a very high death toll. For countries with Γ1 > 0.15 the range of γ∞ becomes
narrower with increasing Γ1 . In this group, we find most Western-European countries and
the United States. Finland, Norway, Iceland, Germany, Denmark, and Austria have Γ1 in
the lower end of this range and J∞ ∼ 102 or less, while for Sweden, United States, United
Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, and Spain, Γ1 is higher and J∞ ∼ 103 . The overall impression is
that the variability of the death toll in Western Europe and the United States is largely due
to variations of the initial growth rate, and to a lesser extent due to variations of the later
decay. There are exceptions, however. For instance, Sweden and Austria have almost the
same Γ1 , but γ∞ on opposite tails of the distribution, yielding about ten times higher death
toll in Sweden.
In the rest of the world, the picture is more mixed. Some low-income countries, with
low initial growth rates, still end up with a high death toll because the decay rate is also
low. On the other hand, high-income countries in South-East Asia suffer few deaths due to
a combination of low initial growth combined with moderate or high decay rate.
The exceptionally low Γ1 for China is due to the strong confinement of the epidemic to
the Hubei province, which constitutes only 4.3 percent of the Chinese population. If we
had treated Hubei as a country, the death toll per million would have been 23 times higher,
and Γ1 would have increased by a factor ln 23 ≈ 3 and become more like that of Japan.
Remember that Γ1 is defined as the growth rate at the time the death toll exceeds one per
million, and this time comes earlier if the population is considered to be only that of Hubei.
This observation underscores that geographic isolation of the epidemic to limited regions
within a country is crucial in reducing the initial growth rate and the total death toll. The
success of the Chinese strategy in limiting the first wave is the effective isolation of Hubei
from the rest of China and the very strict lockdown within the province.
A caveat of this entire discussion is that the death rates reported from the various countries may be inaccurate. Systematic under-reporting will influence the estimate of Γ1 , but not
that of γ∞ . At present, we have not been able to make systematic corrections to these figures

15

for all countries. Corrections based on figures for excess mortality is a possibility for some
countries, but such figures do not exist for many of countries for which the official COVID19 death rates are least reliable. Excess mortality may also give rise to under-estimation
of COVID-19 deaths in countries with effective interventions, because these interventions
reduce mortality from other diseases.

5

Conclusion

The huge variability of the death toll among countries in the first wave of the COVID-19
epidemic is puzzling. Many causal explanations have been suggested in the media, but on a
world scale, little systematic work has been published in the peer-reviewed literature. The
present work does not attempt a causal explanation, but seeks a quantitative characterization
of the epidemic curve in terms of as few parameters as possible. We demonstrate that this
is possible in terms of the Gompertz function, which describes a three-parameter sigmoid
curve. One of these parameters is redundant because it only determines the time origin that
determines the point in time when the death toll per million inhabitants exceeds one. The
two parameters that determine the total death toll is the initial relative growth rate of the
number of daily deaths and the decay rate of this number as the first wave subsides. The
salient property of the Gompertz function is that the total death toll of the first wave depends
exponentially on the ratio of those rates. It hence describes the exceptional sensitivity of
the death toll to the values of these rates.
We illustrate these features by applying the analysis to compare the effect of initial growth
rates and later decay rates of the neighbouring countries Norway and Sweden, where more
than ten times higher death toll in Sweden is attributed to a higher early death rate and, to
a lesser extent, a lower decay rate in the subsiding phase. It is also shown to be related to
a somewhat higher reproduction number in Sweden throughout the entire wave.
The Gompertz function is shown to be well fitted to the death data for 73 countries
around the world, and plots of the Gompertz parameters for these countries show that
they are broadly distributed in this parameter space, suggesting that there are many routes
to a given death toll. A task for future work is to find out more about commonalities
between countries that are close to each other in the parameter space, and about features
that distinguish countries that appear similar but end up at different locations in this space.
The most straightforward approach would be some sort of multiple regression analysis by
which the growth rate Γ1 and the decay rate γ∞ are linked to socioeconomic variables and
intervention measures.
At the time of writing, many countries are entering the second epidemic wave. It will be
interesting to investigate if this wave can be analyzed by the same method and to study if
parameters change from the first to the second wave. A more complete data set, involving
more countries, will also become available, facilitating a more complete classification of the
epidemic curves of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Appendix
A

From the SIR model to the Gompertz model

Let N be the total population, S the number of susceptible individuals, and I the number
of infected. We then have,
dS
IS
= −β ,
(24)
dt
N
dI
IS
=β
− αI,
(25)
dt
N
where β is the rate by which the infection is being transmitted, and α is the rate by which
the infected are isolated from the susceptible population. Decoupled from these, we have the
equation for the number R of individuals that are quarantined, deceased, and recovered;
dR
= αI.
dt

(26)

These three equations constitute the SIR model.

A.1

Nonlinear evolution of an “old” disease

During the development of an epidemic, health authorities typically report the accumulated
number of registered infected J = N − S. The equations for J and I then take the form


dJ
J
=β 1−
I,
(27)
dt
N
dI
=
dt



J
β−α−β
N


I.

(28)

When one studies the flare-up of an old pathogen, there may be a considerable herd immunity,
i.e., J may be of the same order of magnitude as N . Then, the peak growth rate of I is
attained when


α
,
(29)
J = Js = N 1 −
β
and the saturation and decay of the epidemic is a nonlinear effect.

A.2

Evolution of an epidemic due to a ”new” pathogen

If the pathogen is new, there is no immunity in the population from the start, and if we
assume that only a small fraction of the population is affected by the epidemic, we have
J  N for all times and we can linearize;
dJ
= βI,
dt
17

(30)

dI
= (β − α)I.
(31)
dt
Initial growth, and later decay, of I now requires that α and β evolve in time, and that
β − α changes sign from positive to negative at a certain time ts . Since J(t) is monotonically
increasing with t, there is a bijective mapping between t and J, and we can think of α, β,
and I as functions of J rather than t.

A.3

The reproductive number

If we define R(J) = β/α as the reproductive number, Eqs. (24) and (25) reduce to
1
dI
=1−
.
dJ
R(J)

(32)

It is not unreasonable to assume that R(J) is a monotonically decreasing function, since
measures to reduce the transmission rate will lower β as J increases and measures to diagnose
and quarantine infected individuals will increase α. I(J) has its maximum at J = Js = J(ts )
for which R(Js ) = 1. This is also the inflection point for J(t);
 2 
dJ
= 0.
(33)
dt2 ts

A.4

Reduction to a generalized logistic growth model

Since I = I(J), the equation

can be written as

dJ
= −βI,
dt

(34)

dJ
= γ(J) J,
dt

(35)

where

I
γ(J) = β ,
(36)
J
is the relative growth rate for J. Eq. (34) has the general form of a nonlinear growth model
with a growth rate depending on the growing variable itself.

A.5

Richards’ growth model

J(t) takes some sort of sigmoid form, which means that γ(J) is monotonically decreasing
from γ(J = 0) = γ (0) to γ(J∞ ) = 0, where J∞ = J(t → ∞). A common form is to express
γ(J) by a function depending on the three parameters γ (0) , J∞ , and ν;

A.6

The Gompertz limit; ν → 0, γ (0) ν → γ∞ < ∞

It is observed from Figure 8 that the limit ν → 0 corresponds to a rapid initial decay of the
relative growth rate γ(t), followed by a slower decay towards zero as J → J∞ . By fitting
the Richards model to time series for countries that have gone through the first wave of the
epidemic, we typically find small values for the exponent ν. This suggests that for countries
with a reasonably rapid response to the increasing death tolls it may be reasonable to look
at this limit, and hence reduce the number of free parameters by one. The resulting model is
the one suggested by Gompertz [7]. Using the relation limν→0 ν −1 [1 − (J/J∞ )ν ] = ln (J∞ /J),
it is easily shown that in this limit Eq. (37) reduces to
 
J∞
,
(43)
γ(J) = γ∞ ln
J
and Eq. (40) to

J(t) = J∞

J0
J∞

exp (−γ∞ t)
,

(44)

Note that in the Gompertz limit, γ(J) diverges as J → 0, while for finite ν (Richards’
model) it converges towards γ (0) . The important feature, however, is not the growth during
the zoonotic stage, or the stage when the epidemic is dominated by imported cases, but
rather the stages when the pathogen is transmitted in the population. By defining the time
origin t = 0 as the time when J exceeds a certain threshold J0 , and considering only t ≥ 0,
we are concerned with the initial growth rate
 
J∞
,
(45)
γ0 = γ(J0 ) = γ∞ ln
J0
which is completely determined by the model parameters; J0 , J∞ , and γ∞ .
