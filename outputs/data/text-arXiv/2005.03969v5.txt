Markets are subjected to both endogenous and exogenous risks that have caused disruptions to
financial and economic markets around the globe, leading eventually to fast stock market declines.
In the past, markets have recovered after any economic disruption. On this basis, we focus on the
outbreak of COVID-19 as a case study of an exogenous risk and analyze its impact on the Standard
and Poor’s 500 (S&P500) index. We assumed that the S&P500 index reaches a minimum before
rising again in the not-too-distant future. Here we present two cases to forecast the S&P500 index.
The first case uses an estimation of expected deaths released on 02/04/2020 by the University of
Washington. For the second case, it is assumed that the peak number of deaths will occur 2-months
since the first confirmed case occurred in the USA. The decline and recovery in the index were
estimated for the following three months after the initial point of the predicted trend. The forecast is a
projection of a prediction with stochastic fluctuations described by 𝑞-gaussian diffusion process with
three spatio-temporal regimes. Our forecast was made on the premise that any market response can
be decomposed into an overall deterministic trend and a stochastic term. The prediction was based
on the deterministic part and for this case study is approximated by the extrapolation of the S&P500
data trend in the initial stages of the outbreak. The stochastic fluctuations have the same structure as
the one derived from the past 24 years. A reasonable forecast was achieved with 85% of accuracy.

1. Introduction
In the investigation of the stock market dynamics, there
are two well-defined approaches: the “descriptive" and “structural" models [1]. Nowadays, these models attempt to capture the endogenous and exogenous systemic risks of market
movements[1, 2, 3, 4]. Endogenous risks have been modeled
in a microeconomic fashion by considering the interactions
between agents and how these change over time, causing
non-linear disruptions even if system parameters change in a
smooth fashion [5, 6, 7]. New “descriptive models" present
endogenous systemic risks as a dynamic factor affected by
the flow of market orders and time scale [2], excessive profits, and excessive losses [8] and large positive or negative
variation in stock markets index [9, 10] due to market activity. The recent “structural models" which are based on
physical model systems such as a combination of oscillation
within a basin of free energy or external force [3, 11], spin
glasses [12], and kinetic Ising model to model stock market
network [13] proposed a natural non-equilibrium system. In
most cases, they introduce the exogenous systemic risks as
a global risk component which evolves all the time affecting
prices of traded assets. The effects of these systemic risks are
likely causes of abrupt changes at the macro-level of market
dynamics [14, 15, 16, 17].
In both systemic risks (endogenous and exogenous) the
market response can be decomposed into two parts, a response function that models changes in the overall trend of
the system, called the skeleton [18], and the other is the
stochastic term [19]. In this work, we analyse the nonlinkarina.ariascalluari@uni.sydney.edu.au

ear properties of both of these terms.
The endogenous systemic risks are an inherent part of
the nonlinear dynamics of a market and may have detectable
precursor signals that act as warnings similar to those used
in other nonlinear systems such as climate and ecology [20].
As an example, the 1987 market crash is likely an endogenous event [21], as it had a measurably different effect on
market dynamics than the September 11 attacks [22] and the
1995 Kobe earthquake [21] which pose systemic exogenous
risks to markets. The last two events cannot be endogenized
into market prices by ‘rational’ agents ahead of time because
they are not foreseeable [23].
This paper presents the solution of a critical outstanding
problem in finding how the market is coupled to the globe,
and how exogenous and unpredictable global events produce
deterministic trends in the market. In Section 2, we decompose the price return into a deterministic component and a
𝑞-stationarity fluctuating term. In Section 3, the solution was
applied to the forecasting of S&P500 index’s response due
to the outbreak of COVID-19. In Section 4, we present a
discussion on how this model provides an overview of the
impacts of an exogenous market shock that can be used as a
reference in developing predictive models with more accuracy.

2. The Model
For this analysis, it is assumed that COVID-19 poses systematic exogenous risks that affect stock markets behaviour.
Therefore, our forecast models considered epidemiological
research results to project the impact of COVID-19. Epidemiological researchers from around the world have proPage 1 of 9

duced an extensive array of analyses in order to model the
spread, growth, peak, and ultimately the decline of the disease [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. For countries like China, Japan,
Italy, and Iran, their epidemiological curve of COVID-19
progression displays a peak before the second month since
the first cases were detected [29, 30, 31]. In countries like
the UK, Australia and Germany, the governments have taken
mitigation measures to slow the impact [25, 24].The simultaneous reaction of governments, companies, consumers and
media, have created a demand and supply shock, making
COVID-19 a qualitatively different economic crisis than previous crises [32]. This economic ‘wedging’ of falling supply
and demand is caused by rapidly escalating unemployment
decreasing consumer demand where, in the US for example, 17 million Americans have applied for unemployment
insurance in the first three weeks of the crisis [33], and businesses are closing their doors reducing the supply of manufactured goods across the globe [34]. As a consequence
financial markets around the world have fallen precipitously
and market volatility is at near-all-time highs [35]. For example the S&P500 has registered the worst one-day fall in
the last 24 years and the third biggest percentage loss in its
history.
In the uncertain environment of COVID-19 it is difficult to
forecast the fluctuations of the S&P500 index. We then need
assumptions such as the mortality rates due to COVID-19
or the duration of the current shutdown of economic activity. Our central assumption is based on a predicted peak for
COVID-19 deaths. Current results in Figure 1 based on the
daily World Health Organization reports [36] show that the
S&P500 responds to the inflection points of the cumulative
amount of deaths and confirmed cases with no lag. This fact
supports our assumption that when a peak number of deaths
occurs, the market reaches a stationary point.
We developed two cases to forecast the fluctuations of
the S&P 500. In the first case the peak number was located
on the 23rd of May by the University of Washington [37].
The second case is where the peak number of deaths is considered 2-months since the first death occurred [38]. After
this point we expect a recovery period as economic activity
starts to return to normal. To construct the forecast, we assume that the stock market index can be decomposed into
a deterministic trend and a stationary stochastic fluctuation.
The statistics of the fluctuation have been obtained by analyzing the S&P500 index during the 24 year period from
January 1996 to March 2020 [39]. 𝐼(𝑡0 ) is the initial point
of the stock market index for some time point 𝑡0 , and the index 𝐼(𝑡) for 𝑡 > 𝑡0 is its time evolution. In these predictions
we take 𝑡0 = 24∕03∕2020 and 𝑡0 = 28∕02∕2020 for the two
different forecast. The price return at time 𝑡 is defined by:

time(dd/mm/yy)

Figure 1: The S&P500 decreased after the WHO (World
Health Organization) reported an increment in confirmed
cases 𝑠(𝑡) and number of deaths 𝑑(𝑡) due to COVID-19. The
increments in the number of cases are represented with a
black filled point, which are an abrupt change of slope of
the first derivative of 𝑠(𝑡)𝑐𝑢𝑚 and 𝑑(𝑡)𝑐𝑢𝑚 .

𝑋(𝑡) = 𝑋(𝑡) + 𝑥(𝑡).

(2)

The trend 𝑋(𝑡) was obtained by averaging the index over a
moving time window. The size of the window was one year,
that was optimized to guarantee that the fluctuations around
the trend exhibit stationary behavior. The governing equation of this stationary behaviour is [40]:

By using a curve-fitting analysis on the S&P500 data over

The standard error function is a special case of the 𝑞-error

written as:
𝑃 (𝑋(𝑡) − 𝑋(𝑡) > |𝑥|) = 1 − erf 𝑞 (𝑥∕(𝐷𝑡)1∕𝛼 ).

(10)

We use Eq.(10) to develop a forecast of the market based
on the historical fluctuations in the S&P500. Figure 2 shows

some key dates over the last 24 years of the S&P500. The
market dynamics consists of periods of a bull market (systematic increase of the index) and a bear market (systematic decrease). The crashes in this plot are discontinuous.
They occur in a very short period of time that we attribute
as noise that it is added to the deterministic component. For
example, during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) there is
a long-term decline in the value of the S&P500 that we can
interpret as the deterministic trend, but near the point where
Lehman Brothers collapses there is a discontinuous market
crash. In fact, there are several very large daily price movements that are not always attributable to a specific event.
These ‘crashes’ (both up and down) are more similar to large
stochastic movements, not a part of the deterministic component of the market dynamics.

3. Effect of COVID-19 to S&P500
To establish the effect of COVID-19 on the market we
assume that it has a deterministic, exogenous impact. This
impact is assumed to be a response function that corresponds
to a COVID-19 induced bear market followed by a smooth
transition to a bull market. As a further refinement we asPage 3 of 9

sume that this transition is dictated by a key quantitative factor: the estimated date on which the mortality rate peaks.
Our first estimation of this trend (a private communication
between authors on April 2, 2020) was based on the timeframe from 31∕01∕2020 to 24∕03∕2020 in which a bearmarket decline in 𝐼(𝑡) had already been observed. For the

Figure 3: A downward trend followed by a market recovery
is estimated by applying a parabolic fitting (magenta line)
and hyperbola fitting (blue line). Three steps were applying
to define each deterministic trend. The step ii is the same for
both cases.
For the hyperbola three similar conditions were applied: The
slope of the market recovery (bull market) (i∗ ) is assume to
be 0.5 of the slope of the market’s collapse similar to the previous crashes that have occurred over the past 24-years. The
slope (ii) is the same as the parabola and point (iii∗ ) is the
intersection of the slopes (i∗ ) and (ii). For both methods the
point (iii) was based on the public information available by
the University of Washington where the death rate was estimated to peak on 24/05/2020 (60 days from 𝑡0 )). To obtain
this prediction of the trend we assumed that there is no time
lag between the peak of mortality rate and the time where
the market starts to recover.
Up to this point we have evaluated the systemic risk as
the deterministic aspect of the market evolution, which is ofK Arias Calluari et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

ten neglected by analysts in the determination of the impact
of exogenous events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In
what follows we evaluate the risk associated with the stochastic fluctuations of the index by ‘dressing’ the deterministic
risk with a 𝑞-Gaussian diffusion process. In a previous publication [40] we found that the 𝑞-Gaussian fluctuations of
the S&P500 index around the trend have distinctive superdiffusion spatio-temporal regimes (‘space’ refers to the size
of the fluctuations). To allow long-term forecasting on the
order of days, we have extended the analysis for longer times.
Three well-defined regimes are observed in Fig. 4,
• Zone A: Strong superdiffusion process with short-time
correlations
• Zone B: Weak superdiffusion process with weak time
correlations
• Zone C: Normal diffusion process with no time correlations.
These zones are well-distinguished in time, where Zone
A goes from 0 to 38 minutes, Zone B from 10 days to 28 days
and after a crossover period Zone C starts at 30 days (Fig. 4).
Note that the time series tends to a classical diffusion process
for large times, in agreement with the classical Central Limit
Theorem. See [40] for a complete analysis of these zones and
their derivation.
Two techniques were used to calculated the optimal 𝑞 for
each 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡), one focusing on the PDF and the other focusing

on each CDF of detrended price return. For the first technique two methods were used. The least square method and
𝑞-moments method. The least square method applies Eq.(4)
as the fitting function. The 𝑞-moments method uses a system of two equations and two variables, 𝑞 and 𝛼. The first
equation is given by the “second moment" or variance ⟨𝑥2 ⟩.
The second equation refers to the “escort second moment"
or 𝑞-variance ⟨𝑥2 ⟩𝑞2 . In general, the 𝑞-moments are applied
to PDFs with asymptotic decays because they provide finite
values [42]. The second technique is based on each CDF,
where a least squares method is applied using Eq.(18). The
quality of the fitting models was evaluated after reproducing
the time evolution of 𝐶𝐷𝐹 (𝑥, 𝑡) with the time-dependent fitting parameters previously obtained, then we compare them
with the 𝐶𝐷𝐹 of detrended price return. The best results
were obtained with the second technique, which displays a
smoothness and more accurate time evolution of the 𝐶𝐷𝐹
of detrended price (Figure 5).

𝑡 → ∞.
Then, we construct a forecast of S&P500 using two predicted trends, the parabola and the hyperbola shown in Fig.6.
We note that these trends are approximations based upon the
prices for the following trading days. For that reason both
trends were re-calculated using 𝑡0 = 28∕02∕2020; the date
on which the first death occurred in USA; and 𝐼̃′ (60) = 0;
two months after the first case was confirmed. These new
trends display a better performance, notably the hyperbola
which fits better than the others.
The uncertainty was modeled with the analytical form
of the detrended price by replacing the 𝛼(𝑡), 𝑞(𝑡), and 𝐷(𝑡)
calculated in the Appendix into Eq.(4) with their numerical
estimates. Once the stochastic term is simulated it is added
into the deterministic trend to see the full stochastic path of
𝐼(𝑡).

The corresponding 𝑞, 𝛼 and 𝐷 values that fit each of these
equations are displayed in Fig.A.8(a-c-d). The 𝑞 and 𝛽 values were calculated directly after fitting Eq.(18). The 𝛼 values are calculated as the power law of the 𝛽 value, by averaging the power law over a moving time window smaller than
the transition zone. The 𝐷 value is calculated by replacing 𝛼
in Eq.(16). The results for 𝑞, 𝛼 and 𝐷 obtained by applying
the least squares method of the CDFs are consistent with the

considers 𝑡0 = 24∕03∕2020 and the second one 𝑡0 =

These values represent the probability of a possible variation of 𝑃 (𝑋 − 𝑋 > |𝑥|) which can be visualized as a “cone
of uncertainty”. This probabilistic path of the S&P500 over
the following 60 days (2 months) shows the evolution of the

be developed by formulating the governing equations that
allows transition from strong- to weak- superdiffusion and
converging to a normal diffusion process for large times, as
dictated by the classical Central Limit Theorem. However,
this method opens up a potential opportunity for risk control
in other areas such as climatology, seismology (earthquakes)
and communication networks, where large multivariate data
sets provide a window on the dynamics of the underlying
system.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have presented a model of the stochastic
and systematic risk in the stock market and applied it to forecast the stock market response to COVID-19. We have assumed that the stochastic risk is a 𝑞-Gaussian diffusion process. The systemic risk is the deterministic aspect of the market evolution that is often neglected by market analysts but
here we have assumed that COVID-19 has a deterministic,
exogenous impact on the market. We have dressed this nonlinear skeleton with a 𝑞-Gaussian diffusion process that we
developed in previous work. The response function we have
used for forecasting is a simple behavioural model based on
the assumption that markets recover once prices drop to sufficiently low enough levels, in future work it can be improved
by developing better tools to evaluate systematic risk using
behavioural [43] or macroeconomic [44] models. In addition, our stochastic method is still heuristic and it needs to

A. Supplementary materials
The probability density function (PDF) of the detrended
price is well described by the functional form:
(√ )
√
𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝛽 𝑔𝑞
𝛽𝑥 ,
(12)
where, 𝛽 = (𝐷𝑡)−2∕𝛼 , allows to recovery Eq.(4).
Then, a system of two equations based on variance ⟨𝑥2 ⟩
and 𝑞-variance ⟨𝑥2 ⟩𝑞2 were used to obtain the 𝑞 and 𝛽 values.
The variance ⟨𝑥2 ⟩ has a finite value for 𝑞 < 5∕3;
⟨𝑥2 ⟩ =

1
.
𝛽(5 − 3𝑞)

(13)

The normalized 𝑞-variance ⟨𝑥2 ⟩𝑞 is defined as [42]
⟨𝑥 ⟩𝑞 =

∫−∞ 𝑥2 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡)𝑞 𝑑𝑥
∞

∫−∞ 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡)𝑞 𝑑𝑥

𝐶𝑞
𝐾(𝛽, 𝑞) ≡
[1 − (1 − 𝑞)𝛽𝑥 ] 1 − 𝑞 𝑑𝑥 = √ ,
∫−∞

and also the second moment of 𝑥 is proportional to 𝜕𝛽𝐾(𝛽, 𝑞),
so the analytical solution of the numerator is:
𝑞
∞
𝜕

2 1−𝑞
𝐾(𝛽, 𝑞) = −
𝑥 [1 − (1 − 𝑞)𝛽𝑥 ]

∫−∞

= − 𝛽 −3∕2 𝐶𝑞
2
Then, the analytical solution of the denominator is:
∞

∫−∞

𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡)𝑞 𝑑𝑥 =

3−𝑞
2

Inserting this identity into the Eq.(14), we obtain:
⟨𝑥2 ⟩𝑞2 =

1
.
(3 − 𝑞)𝛽

(15)

The equation system is defined by Eqs(13) and (15) and is
used to calculate 𝛽 and 𝑞 as a function of time. The 𝛼 and 𝐷
values are calculated using:
(16)

𝛽 = (𝐷𝑡)−2∕𝛼

We divide the data of S&P500 in overlapping time windows
not longer than the transition zones. In each window the
exponent of the power law relation is calculated and then
the Eq.(16) is used to calculate 𝐷 and 𝛼. The results for 𝑞,𝛼
and 𝛽 are shown in Subfigures a-1,b-1,c-1 and d-1.
In Subfigure a-1 an abrupt transition in 𝑞 is noticed when
𝑡 = 30 days. This abrupt change leads to a discontinuity in
the fitted function 𝑞(𝑡).
We have used an alternative method to extract the parameters, for which this discontinuity is absent. This method is
based on the fitting of the 𝐹 (𝑥, 𝑡) of real price return 𝑥. The
analytical expression of 𝐹 (𝑥, 𝑡) is obtained in terms of the
erf 𝑞 (𝑥, 𝑡). First, Eq.(7) is replaced in Eq.(8),
𝑃 (𝑋(𝑡) − 𝑋(𝑡) > |𝑥|) = 2 − 2𝐹 (𝑥, 𝑡).

(17)

Then,
√ Eq.(17) and Eq.(10) are compared, resulting to
(𝑠 = 𝑥 𝛽);
𝐹 (𝑥, 𝑡) = 0.5 +

erf 𝑞 (𝑠)

(18)

Where,

In general, the q-moments are calculated on PDFs with heavy
tails because they provide finite values. The q-moments and
the standard moments are equal for 𝑞 = 1.
To obtain the analytical solution of the integral in the
numerator and denominator of Eq.( 14), we notice that

Figure A.8: Calculation of 𝑞 and 𝛽 by applying a Equation system [Eqs(13) and (15)] and fittings of 𝐹 (𝑥, 𝑡). (a-1, a-2)
Estimation of 𝑞(𝑡) value, for (a-1) a normalization of units was made. (b-1,b-2) The value of 𝛽 ∼ 𝑡−2∕𝛼 . (c-1,c-2) The
exponent of the power law relation of 𝛽 vs 𝑡 per time window is calculated as 𝛼(𝑡). (d-1,d-2) The 𝐷 value is calculated by
replacing 𝛼 in Eq.(16). The convergence to a Normal distribution function is observed when 𝑡 → ∞ with 𝑞 = 1 and 𝛼 = 2.

The Eq.(18) is used to calculate 𝑞 and 𝛽 value as a function
of time. The 𝛼 values are calculated again with Eq.(16) by
overlapping time windows, and then, 𝐷 is obtained by replacing 𝛼 in 16.
These results are shown in the second column of Figure A.8.
The Subfigure (a-2) does not display an abrupt transition of
𝑞 value. For 𝛽, 𝛼 and 𝐷 the transitions are smooth in each
zone.
