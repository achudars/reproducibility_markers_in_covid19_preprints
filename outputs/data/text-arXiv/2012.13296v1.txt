Abstract—As the COVID-19 outbreak evolves around the
world, the World Health Organization (WHO) and its Member
States have been heavily relying on staying at home and lock
down measures to control the spread of the virus. In the last
months, various signs showed that the COVID-19 curve was
flattening, but even the partial lifting of some containment
measures (e.g., school closures and telecommuting) appear to
favor a second wave of the disease. The accurate evaluation
of possible countermeasures and their well-timed revocation are
therefore crucial to avoid future waves or reduce their duration.
In this paper, we analyze patient and route data of infected
patients from January 20, 2020, to May 31, 2020, collected by the
Korean Center for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC). This
data analysis helps us to characterize patient mobility patterns
and then use this characterization to parameterize simulations
to evaluate different what-if scenarios. Although this is not a
definitive model of how COVID-19 spreads in a population, its
usefulness and flexibility are illustrated using real-world data for
exploring virus spread under a variety of circumstances.

APIs (e.g., Google Maps [14], Kakao Map [15], or Naver
Map [16]) to extract geographical coordinates (i.e., latitude
and longitude) and other data. Extracted data are shared and
made publicly available [17]. Although the KCDC data set is
a valuable resource for studying the spread of COVID-19, it
presents some limitations that are described in the following.
•

I. I NTRODUCTION
The first human cases of COVID-19 were observed in
Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019 [1]. Since then,
COVID-19 has spread in 114 countries all over the world.
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declares COVID-19 the first
pandemic caused by a coronavirus [2]. Face masks [3], social
distancing [4], and, in the worst cases, quarantine and (partial)
lockdown measures [5], [6] are the most commonly adopted
strategies to flatten the infection curve. The above measures
proved effective in slowing down and limiting the pandemic
outbreak [7], but new COVID-19 waves are expected if
mitigation measures are lifted [8], [9], [10]. Simulation and
mathematical models can be used to evaluate the effectiveness
of proposed mitigation actions in advance, such as restrictions to population movement. Typically, the effectiveness of
models is tied up to their parameterization. Past work uses
synthetic [11] or interaction data limited to small areas (e.g.,
households) [12].
The data sets used in this paper contain data collected by
the Korean Center of Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC)
and local governments that, from January 20, 2020, to May 31,
2020, monitored infected people and logged their movements
by using CCTV, cellphones, and credit card transactions [13].
The KCDC records patient movements in plain text (i.e.,
natural language) without any unified rule. Researchers parsed
these logs through automated code and rule-based methods to
extract keywords that are then used with web mapping service

South Korea has a small number of COVID-19 cases
(i.e., 24,027 on October 3, 2020) compared to other
countries, and the last version of the KCDC data set
contains data collected up to May 31, 2020 (the KCDC
data set has not been updated since then). On May 31,
approximately 11,500 COVID-19 cases were confirmed
in South Korea [13], [18], but only the 35% of them have
been logged into the data set.
There is route data information for only a portion of the
patients. Patient movement has been logged only for the
15% of all confirmed cases by May 31.
Data are not collected evenly in the whole country.
Although a good amount of data are available for Seoul,
Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gangwon-do, very little information is provided for other provinces.
Some locations visited by patients are not recorded in
the data set due to privacy issues. For this reason, patient
information and route data do not always coincide. For
example, there are patients that infect each other even if
their routes do not cross. This may happen when patients
belong to the same household (locations where people
live are rarely logged in the data set).
Patient and route data may be incomplete (i.e., some
attributes are missing, such as the type of locations visited
by some patients) and require manual intervention before
analyzing the data set.

Different strategies are adopted to address the above challenges. If some attributes are missing, they are manually
retrieved by using available data. For example, in the case of
patient routes with missing location type (e.g., store, school,
hospital), other attributes, such as geographical coordinates,
are used to retrieve the visited location and identify its type.
Data sets with missing data (e.g., movements of only the
15% of confirmed cases are logged) cannot be always made
complete by looking for extra information. In this paper, we
advocate using available data to extract information on movement habits of people living in Seoul (e.g., daily travel speed

and distance based on patient age and day of the week). We
feed this information to a patched version of GeoMason [19],
a tool that uses agent-based models (ABM) and geographic
information systems (GIS) to study disease outbreaks (e.g., a
cholera outbreak was studied using this tool in [20]). This way,
we simulate1 interactions of thousands of people in Seoul on
roads and in buildings to investigate the COVID-19 outbreak
in the largest metropolis of South Korea and evaluate different
what-if scenarios. This tool offers a flexible model based on
real-world COVID-19 spread information that can be used
to facilitate evaluation of different mitigation measures and
different patient behaviors.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sections II
and III describe the data sets used in this paper and their
analysis. Section IV presents the patched version of GeoMason
and the data used to simulate the COVID-19 outbreak in Seoul.
Section VI discusses related work and Section VII concludes
the paper.
II. T HE KCDC DATA S ET
In this section, the KCDC data sets are described. The
PatientInfo and PatientRoute data sets contain information
and routes of COVID-19 patients in Seoul, respectively. The
amount of data in each data set is shown in Table I. Number
of (healthy and sick) people moving across Seoul districts are
also provided in the SeoulFloating set. This data has been
collected using the SK Telecom Big Data Hub.
PatientInfo data set. This data set provides epidemiological data of COVID-19 patients. It contains 4004 different
entries, each entry represents a different patient identified
by an ID (patient id). Other attributes include the gender
and age (sex and age), their provenance (country, province,
and city), whether they have been infected in a known case
(infection case, e.g., overseas inflow or contact with patient)
and the ID of the patient that infected them (infected by),
the number of people that the patient came in contact with
(contact number), and the date of their first symptoms (symptom onset date).
PatientRoute data set. This data set contains 8092 entries,
each one reporting a visit (to one of 2992 unique locations)
of 1472 unique South Korean COVID-19 patients logged in
this data set. A location is unequivocally identified by its
latitude and longitude. Province, city, and type (e.g., airport,
hospital, store) of each location are also provided. Since the
attribute type of almost the 30% of entries is set to etc
(i.e., locations that cannot be identified using the rule-based

approach of [17]), we manually look for their type using their
geographical coordinates and OpenStreetMap [21]. Each entry
also contains the patient (patient id (same as in the PatientInfo
data set) and global num, another ID used only in this data
set) that visited the location on a specific date. The time spent
on the location is not available. However, locations visited by
a patient in a single day are logged in chronological order.
SeoulFloating data set. This data set provides hourly data of
people moving across Seoul districts. Data are collected from
January 1 to April 30, 2020, by SK Telecom, a Korean wireless
telecommunications operator. Collected data are grouped by
gender, age, and district and allows visualizing the movement
of people in Seoul during this period. Age is provided at the
decade granularity for people in their 20s through 70s. No
information is provided for children or for people who are 80
or more years old. Note that this data set reports data on the
entire Seoul population, not just the COVID-19 patients, and
only considers those who have cell phones.
III. W ORKLOAD C HARACTERIZATION
Although the information contained in the considered data
sets is not as accurate as one would like, it still allows
for analyzing patient movements and interactions with high
accuracy. In this section, we discuss information that we
extract from the analyzed data sets and how it is used as input
in the GeoMason simulation tool [19].
A. Visited Locations
Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) depict a heat map of the most visited locations in South Korea and Seoul, respectively, showing where
COVID-19 outbreaks are more likely to happen. Heat maps in
Fig. 1 also show the South Korean cities for which movement
data are recorded. Visibly, Seoul is the city with the most
visited locations. Within Seoul, the south-west and south-east
areas are those with more patient routes. The financial district
and company head-quarters are located in the south-west part
of the city. The south-east region corresponds to the Gangnam
district, see the district outlined in blue in Fig. 1(b). Many
shopping and entertainment centers are located in Gangnam.
B. Seoul Population
Since Seoul has more logs in PatientRoute as shown in
Fig. 1(a), we analyze its population habits from January 1,

2020, to April 30, 2020, and extract information to determine
how to put residents in different classes to model population
movements. Fig. 2 depicts the population (grouped by age) of
both healthy and sick people moving in Seoul on a per-day
basis. Two clear classes of people are identified depending on
their mobility: people that are 20 – 50 years old (adults) and
those that are 60 – 70 (seniors). The first group has higher
mobility within the city during week days, but this mobility
decreases during weekends. The second group (seniors) does
not have any discernible change in mobility patterns during
the week. A dip for the adult class observed on January
25 corresponds to the lunar new year day, no such dip is
observed for the senior class. The Seoul population shows a
peak and a dip on February 23 and in March. Since there is
no clear explanation regarding why, we treat these two days
as measurement outliers and ignore them in the rest of the
analysis. Perhaps because of the pandemic onset in South
Korean and KCDC advice, we observe the mobility of seniors
to decrease at the beginning of February.

Similar data is also available by splitting the dataset into
men and women. Results are not present here due to lack
of space and can be summarized as follows: there is no
discernible difference between the mobility of men or women
during the observed time period.

C. Patient Connections
Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) present a subset of patient connections
(to improve better visibility, we present here only a small
portion of the graph of patient connections). Here nodes depict
patients, black edges connect patients that visited the same
place during the same day, and red edges represent the virus
spreading information obtained from the PatientInfo data set
(i.e., infected by attribute). The node degree in Figs. 3(a)
and 3(b) illustrates the contact degree among patients and
illustrates visually the complexity of the problem.
Fig. 3(c) shows a summary view of the patient connections:
the contact degree CDF of all patients for the entire dataset.
Specifically, three CDFs are shown: one for the whole South
Korea, one for Seoul, and another one for Gyeongsangbukdo (another Korean province). Interestingly, all CDFs have a
similar shape.
Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) show that some red edges do not overlap
with black edges. This means that, even if one of the two nodes
connected by the red edge infected the other, no connections
(i.e., visits to the same location during the same day) have
been recorded in the data set.
High contact degree also indicates that super spreaders (i.e.,
patients that infect many other people) may exist. However,
people that came into contact with many others are not
necessarily super spreaders since it is unknown whether or

not they were sick or healthy when contact occurred. Because
of this, further analysis is required to determine whether or
not a patient is a super spreader.
D. Super Spreaders
Fig. 4 illustrates a subset of patients where the infected by
relationship (i.e., patient A is infected by patient B) is known
from the PatientInfo data set. The entire graph contains 1052
patient nodes and 822 edges representing the known infection
spread. Again, we present just a subset of the data for visibility
here. Red nodes correspond to individuals with available route
information who are known to have infected others, green
nodes correspond to individuals who infected others but have
no available route information and blue nodes correspond to
patients who are not known to have infected others.

This particular subset shows a mix of super spreaders (i.e.,
people who infected more than six people) and low spreaders,
who infected six or fewer people.2 The large “fans” in this
figure are indicative of super spreaders. The different behaviors
of super spreaders and low spreaders are shown in Fig. 5.
Super spreaders account for 3.59% and low spreaders account
for the remaining 96.41% of patients in this figure.
Fig. 5 presents CDFs of the number of people infected by an
individual, the number of days in the log that the individual
appears, the unique locations visited, and the total number
of locations visited. The CDFs in this figure indicate that,
in general, super spreaders tend to be active for more days,
visit more unique locations, and have longer routes than low
spreaders. In particular, we see that all super spreaders in
the data set are active for three or more days and visit three
or more unique locations. Some of these super spreaders are
active for up to 19 days and visit up to 18 unique locations
with route lengths of up to 31 locations.
Outbreaks associated with specific locations (as opposed
to specific super spreaders) can be examined individually as
well. Fig. 6 depicts one specific outbreak at a law firm in
the Gangwon-do province. Nodes indicate patients and edges
indicate that patients were in the same location on the same
date. The patients in the graph account for more than 150 visits
2 We define a “super spreader” as someone who infected at least 6 people.
This allows us to divide the data set to obtain the most noticeable difference
in patient behavior (number of locations, number of days, number of records).

Patient mobility is another important attribute that must be
considered when studying the COVID-19 outbreak. Intuitively,
the more places a patient visits, the higher their mobility is.
Fig. 8 depicts the number of patients that are seen on a specific
number of unique locations (x-axis) for a specific number of
days (y-axis). Note that the above graph does not distinguish
patient mobility across different days. Indeed, looking at the
mobility of individual patients, there are days where they
exhibit high mobility and days where they move significantly
less. This leads us to a more usable definition of mobility as
a function of different time periods (days). Fig. 9(a) shows
the day count of unique locations reached by the patients in
the data set: for 2,063 days (88.9% of days) a typical patient
visits 1–3 locations, while for 258 days (11.1%) more than 3
unique locations are visited.
Defining a high mobility day as a day during which a patient
visits at least L locations, the mobility of a patient is defined

as the ratio of the patient high mobility days to all logged days
for this specific individual. Note that this is not the only way
to define mobility. For simulation purposes (see Section IV),
this definition provides a practical way to capture mobility
with a probability. Based on the histogram shown in Fig. 9(a),
days with L ≤ 3 are considered of low mobility. The CDF
of patient mobility using the above definition is depicted in
Fig. 9(b). The figure shows that 57.6% of patients never visit
more than 4 locations in a day.
Different classes of patients have different mobility.
Fig. 9(c) shows the difference in mobility between super
spreaders and low spreaders, while Fig. 9(d) illustrates mobility by age groups. Super spreaders and young people
have higher mobility compared to low spreaders and seniors,
respectively. For higher percentiles, the low spreaders have
larger mobility than super spreaders due to the small number
of super spreader agents available in the KCDC data set.

Fig. 11: Life cycle of an agent.

Patients behave irresponsibly when they keep moving after
the onset of their first COVID-19 symptoms. This clearly
facilitates the diffusion of the disease since sick people can
still meet and infect healthy ones. We present how long sick
people continue to show mobility after exhibiting symptoms.
Results are shown in Fig. 10, where one can see is that only
the 20% of patients stop moving and isolate immediately after
initial symptoms are observed. Some patients keep moving
for more than a week after initial symptoms were observed,
see Fig. 10(a). They also visit many locations. Figs. 10(b)
and 10(c) show the number of unique and total locations that
sick patients visit after initial symptoms are observed.
IV. S IMULATION
In this section, we show how to parameterize a simulation
based on a patched version of GeoMason [19] using the
characterization presented in Section III. The attributes, life
cycle, and states of an agent are shown in Figure 11. The
following attributes are set during the initialization phase:
1) Infection status. A random agent is selected as patient
zero in the considered area.
2) Position. Agents are randomly placed on a road in the
simulated area.
3) Speed. There are two types of agents: 50% of agents are
considered pedestrian and walk at a speed of 3 MPH
before reaching their destination; other agents drive a
vehicle and their speed is uniformly distributed between
10 and 25 MPH.
4) Type of spreaders. We define two classes of spreaders:
3.59% of patients are super spreaders and 96.41% are
low spreaders (see Section III-D).
5) Mobility. We use the mobility of super spreaders and
low spreaders depicted in Fig. 9(c) to model different
types of patient mobility.

Fig. 12: A screenshot of the simulation: Gangnam district.

In addition to the mobility distribution of super spreaders and
low spreaders, the CDF of daily traveled distance in Fig. 7(a)
is also used to determine the distance to a destination.
The simulation time is defined by cycles. In each simulation
cycle, agents outside a building move along the road towards
their destination; agents inside a building can choose to stay or
leave, based on their mobility. Agents with high mobility have
a high probability to leave the building. Note that agents stay in
a building for at least 15 minutes in order to meet the definition
of close contact [22]. If multiple agents are inside the same
building, they may infect each other with a certain probability.
When infection happens, the agent state changes from healthy
to infected, as the state transition shown in Fig. 11. We assume

the outdoor infection probability to be negligible. Given the
probability of infection inside a building, α, and the number of
infected agents in the building, n, the probability of a healthy
agent to be infected by a contact within the building is:
Pr(infection) = 1 − (1 − α)n .

(1)

It takes 1–14 days for patients to show symptoms after
infection according to the WHO [23]. We therefore use a
Uniform distribution between 1 and 14 days to transition
from infected to symptomatic. Since there exist patients who
continue to move even after showing symptoms, as seen in
Fig. 10, we use the CDF in Fig. 10(a) to determine the number
of active days after their first symptoms. We do not distinguish
the behavior of super and low spreaders because of lack of
data (there are only two super spreaders with symptom onset
information available). After each infected person exhausts
their active days after infection, they are isolated.
Consistent with infectious disease simulation studies [11],
we set the simulation cycle to 5 minutes. The simulation stops
when all agents are infected. We simulate the COVID-19
outbreak in the Gangnam district, i.e., the sub municipality
of Seoul with the most hotspots, see Fig. 1(b). This area
has 11,438 road intersections and 7,043 buildings. Roads and
buildings are placed in the simulated area as described in [24],
a collection of GIS data with regard to Seoul. GeoMason loads
the GIS data (e.g., roads, road intersections, buildings) stored
in a shapefile format, i.e., a file that stores geometric locations
and their attribute information. Although the longest distance
we observe in PatientRoute data set in Seoul is 30 miles,
the longest distance between two buildings in the simulated
Gangnam district is 7.06 miles. Therefore, we normalize the
maximum distance to 3.53, which is half of the longest
distance in the simulated area, to ensure a valid building
selection as the agent’s destination. Gangnam district district’s
population is 604,586 and a total of 7,043 buildings. We do
not have any information on the building stories, entries, or
number of rooms. This information is crucial, especially for
apartment buildings, where multiple people can be inside the
same building at the same time without contact. To address this
lack of information, we limit the population in our simulations.
A screenshot of the GeoMason simulation execution can be
seen in Fig. 12: the black lines are roads that agents travel on,
and green areas are buildings. Agents only have two states
in terms of infection, i.e., infected (red dots) or healthy (blue
dots).
Fig. 13 depicts the percentage of infected population as a
function of time. The simulation stops at 50 days. The graph
illustrates how quickly the entire population is infected for
four infection rates that correspond to measures such as mask
wearing and social distancing. The figure includes results for
two population sizes and shows the speed of the disease spread
as a function of population density, infection in Fig. 13(b) is
faster than Fig. 13(a).
As a companion to Fig. 13, we also present the portions
of “active while infected” and isolated agents, see Fig. 14.
In Fig. 14, the benefit of patient isolation can be seen clearly:

(a) Population = 10,000.

(b) Population = 20,000.

Fig. 13: Percentage of infected population when simulating
patient isolation.

(a) Population = 10,000.

(b) Population = 20,000.

Fig. 14: Percentage of active while infected population.

(a) Population = 10,000.

(b) Population = 20,000.

Fig. 15: Percentage of isolated population.

the percentage of active infected population is decreasing after
showing a peak, which limits the speed of the spread of
the disease. The percentage of isolated population shown in
Fig. 15 explains the decrease of active infected population.
After more agents show symptoms and are isolated, the active
infected population starts dropping.
V. D ISCUSSION AND L IMITATIONS
The proposed approach allows investigating the spreading
of COVID-19 in an urban population. Incomplete and missing
data may limit its generalization and make it far from being
the definitive COVID-19 spreading model. Main limitations of
our approach are discussed in this section.
Scarcity of data. We continue to seek additional data sets on
COVID-19 outbreaks to increase the accuracy of simulations,
however, the current lack of data is an unfortunate limitation.
The limited amount of data for super spreaders affects obser-

vations on their mobility, see Fig. 9(c). Selfish decisions (e.g.,
people that ignore mask mandate) are considered in Section
IV by using different infect ratios due to missing information
about protective measures adopted by patients. The infect ratio
increases with the number of selfish agents. Our approach
accounts for irresponsible behaviors (i.e., people moving after
being infected) as presented in Section III-G. We overcome
the absence of data about movements inside buildings (i.e.,
rooms and floors) by reducing the population size.
Privacy concerns. The KCDC data set is anonymized and
no sensitive data of monitored patients can be retrieved. No
data about the underage population is provided as well as
movements of patients from/to their private homes. This limits
scenarios that can be analyzed, e.g., the impact of school
closures or the spreading of the virus in households.
Input parameter assumptions. The KCDC data set does not
show the mode of transport. We overcome this limitation by
assuming a pedestrian:vehicles ratio of 1:1. Input parameters
can be fully customized and other researchers using our
approach can easily change these values.
VI. R ELATED W ORK
Agent-based models (ABMs) are used in the literature as an
alternative to mathematical models [25] to study interactions
of individuals and investigate their impact on the considered
system [26]. ABMs are used for different purposes, such as
modeling pedestrian movements or resource exploitation [27].
ABMs have been also used for studying the spread of diseases
(e.g., cholera [20] and Ebola [28], [29]) by modeling interactions between humans and their environment. ABMs are often
used with geographical information systems (GIS) to simulate
interactions of individuals in an urban context and investigate
the spread of a diseases in a given area [30].
Ferguson et al. [31] simulate and study the spread of
influenza in British and American households, schools, and
workplaces. They use different data sets to parameterize their
simulation, such as population density data and travel patterns.
The impact of different containment strategies (e.g., travel
restrictions or vaccination) is evaluated against the attack rate
(i.e., R0 , the percentage of at risk population that is infected
by the virus). Only large scale (international) movements are
considered in [31] and it is observed that stricter border
controls delay the peak of the disease by several days. Instead,
we define mobility to account for movements in urban areas.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been largely studied in recent
months due to its disruptive effects on public health. Bi et
al. [32] use a model based on conditional logistic regression to
study the transmission of COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China. Using data from contact-based surveillance and accurate infectorinfectee relationships, they confirm that, on average, COVID19 has a short incubation period (i.e., less than a week) and
a long clinical course. Garg et al. [33] present a framework
to predict hospitalization rates from clinical data (e.g., age,
ethnicity, medical conditions, clinical course) of COVID-19
patients in 14 states of the USA. Pung et al. [34] collect
epidemiological and clinical data from COVID-19 patients to

study the spreading of the virus in three different Singapore
clusters. They account for agent mobility by analyzing cluster
interactions that facilitate the spread of the virus. Differently
from [34], we define agent mobility as the probability that
agents leave the building where they are.
Bock et al. [12] develop a simulation model that investigates
the efficiency of mitigation strategies in slowing down the
spread of the virus by accounting for interactions within
households (where it is hard to social distance). They use
census data and age distribution of Germany and Poland as
input parameters of their model. Pejó and Biczók [35] use
game theory to evaluate the efficiency of face masks and social
distancing in limiting the spread of COVID-19 when there are
selfish agents that do not use any countermeasures. Similarly,
Bhattacharyya and Bauch [36] use game theory to evaluate
the efficiency of protective vaccines (the safest way to achieve
herd immunity [37]) when selfish agents refuse to get the shot.
Rader et al. [38] study the spread of COVID-19 using spatial,
urbanization, climate, and census data of worldwide cities.
They observe that cities that are more densely populated are
affected by larger incidence and more prolonged epidemic.
Grossmann et al. [39] propose a stochastic network-based
COVID-19 spreading model and compare its results with those
obtained through an ordinary differential equations (ODE)
model. In their network-based model, they use random graph
models to represent interaction structures and human connections. They observe that ODE models struggle to correctly
represent inhomogeneity of interaction structures, a feature
that profoundly affects the spread of the virus.
Rockett et al. [40] use ABM parameterized with census
data and transmission pathways to investigate the spread of
COVID-19 in Australia. Kim et al. [11] use synthetic locationbased social network data sets to study outbreak diseases (e.g.,
COVID-19) and evaluate the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. None of these studies extract people movements
and dynamics from available data sets to parameterize models
and analyze the spread of the virus.
VII. C ONCLUSIONS
Information and routes of South Korean COVID-19 patients
are analyzed to study the disease outbreak in the Gangnam
district of Seoul. Movement habits in South Korea are extracted by available data sets to parameterize simulations,
based on ABM and GIS, and study interactions among people.
Preliminary results show that the proposed approach correctly
associates the virus spread velocity with the virus infectiousness and the population size.
This GeoMason model can be used to flexibly examine
and evaluate a wide variety of different scenarios based
on patterns in real-world data. While it is not a definitive
COVID-19 spread model, it can be used to investigate useful
what-if scenarios. We are currently working on expanding
the simulation model to evaluate the effectiveness of partial
lockdown measures such as placing distance restrictions and
curfews.
