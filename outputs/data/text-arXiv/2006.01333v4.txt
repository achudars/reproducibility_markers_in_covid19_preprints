Abstract: Over the past few months, the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been expanding
over the world. A reliable and accurate dataset of the cases is vital for scientists to conduct related research
and for policy-makers to make better decisions. We collect the United States COVID-19 daily reported data
from four open sources: the New York Times, the COVID-19 Data Repository by Johns Hopkins University,
the COVID Tracking Project at the Atlantic, and the USAFacts, then compare the similarities and differences
among them. To obtain reliable data for further analysis, we first examine the cyclical pattern and the following anomalies, which frequently occur in the reported cases: (1) the order dependencies violation, (2) the
point or period anomalies, and (3) the issue of reporting delay. To address these detected issues, we propose
the corresponding repairing methods and procedures if corrections are necessary. In addition, we integrate
the COVID-19 reported cases with the county-level auxiliary information of the local features from official
sources, such as health infrastructure, demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental information, which
are also essential for understanding the spread of the virus.
Key words and phrases: Anomaly detection; Coronavirus; Count time series; Data comparison; Data integration; Outlier correction.

Introduction

Since the first infected case reported in December 2019, the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID19) has unfolded across the globe. In the US, coronavirus has infected more than five million people
and killed over 160,000 people, as of the time of writing. While essential public health, economic
and social science research in measuring and modeling COVID-19 and its effects is underway, reliable
and accurate datasets are vital for scientists to conduct related research and for governments to make
better decisions Killeen et al. (2020). Unfortunately, errors could occur in the data collection process,
especially under such a pandemic. In this work, we focus on the data collection, comparison, data
inconsistency detection, and the corresponding curating.

Living through unprecedented times, governments must rely on timely, reliable data to make decisions to mitigate harm and support their citizens. Every day, several volunteer groups and organizations
work very hard on collecting data on COVID-19 from all the counties and states in the US. There are
four primary sources, including (1) the New York Times (NYT) NYT (2020a), (2) the COVID Tracking Project at the Atlantic (Atlantic) Atlantic (2020), (3) the data repository by the Center for Systems
Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) CSSE, JHU (2020), and (4) USAFacts USAFacts (2020). Although these sources usually obtain their confirmed infectious and death
cases data from the government agencies, the counts still vary due to the time of their collection as well
as several other issues. However, these differences can be critical for real-time analysis. In this work,
we first collect and compare the COVID-19 daily reported data from the above four open resources.
We observe a seven-day cyclical pattern for daily new cases and new deaths at the state and national
level in the US. To test if the observed patterns are not accidental, we conduct a seasonality hypothesis
test at the county, state and national level for the infected and death count time series from March 15 to
July 25, 2020.
The COVID-19 data pose unique data quality challenges due to its spatiotemporal nature, and the
problem of delayed-reporting and under-reporting. In this paper, we provide some anomaly and outlier
detection techniques in the context of time series. After the anomaly detection, we explore various
methods to repair the problematic data. To be more specific, the entire data cleaning procedure has
been divided into two categories: (1) manual cleaning, and (2) automatic cleaning. On the one hand,
manual cleaning has very high accuracy; on the other hand, it is challenging to implement due to
the high cost in time and effort. In this paper, we propose some data repairing methods to address
the aforementioned issues. We summarize the background of these methods and give details on the
implementation of the repairing procedure for COVID-19 reported data with manual and/or automatic
cleaning methods. Although other researchers also mentioned some similar data problems for COVID19 in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one that focuses on how to address
these issues and repair the COVID-19 data.
Furthermore, it has been observed that the local characteristics, such as socioeconomic inequity,
may also contribute to the spread of epidemic Ahmed et al. (2020); Silver (2020). For example, the
intrinsic local community characteristics might influence and shape the spread of COVID-19, such as
mobility, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The availability of census data thus leads us to
include all the epidemic data, control measures, and local information while modeling the infections,
deaths, and recoveries. To facilitate research in identifying the significant factors that affect the disease
spread pattern and predict future infections and deaths, we also collect and combine local auxiliary
information at the county level in the US from reliable sources.
To help users better visualize the epidemic data, we developed multiple R shiny apps embedded
into a COVID-19 dashboard launched on March 27, 2020. Currently, we provide both infectious and

3
death maps and time series of the US. Moreover, we provide a short-term (seven-day) forecast Wang
et al. (2020c) (updated daily) and a long-term (four-month) projection Wang et al. (2020d) (updated
weekly) of the COVID-19 infected and death count at both the county level and state level. For public
usage, a Github repository (https://github.com/covid19-dashboard-us/cdcar) is established to provide daily updated and cleaned data. An R package cdcar is also created for anomaly
detection and repairing. In summary, we expect the proposed methods to have the following scientific
merits. (i) Before choosing and integrating the data sources for analysis, it is important to understand
how the data were collected and preprocessed. Therefore, in this article, we first investigate the similarities and dissimilarities among multiple data sources. (ii) Noticing the anomalies in the epidemic
data, we develop several anomaly and outlier detection techniques in the context of count time series.
Meanwhile, we further discover the reasons for these anomalies. (iii) After the anomaly detection, we
introduce several methods to repair the problematic data and the corresponding historical data. Then
we obtain our database by integrating the cured data with many local characteristics. (iv) The proposed
methods and the data are built into an R package, which is publicly available through GitHub.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the data related to the study of
COVID-19, including a detailed description of the epidemic data, policy data, demographic characteristics, healthcare infrastructure, socioeconomic status, environmental factor and mobility data. Section 3
discusses the comparison of the epidemic data from different sources. Section 4 describes the cyclical
pattern, types of anomalies of the COVID-19 reported time series, and how to perform the anomaly
detection. Section 5 outlines methods for data repairing. Section 6 describes how to implement the
proposed data comparison, anomaly detection and repairing procedure, and provide the details of the
usage notes. Section 7 concludes the paper with a discussion.

Data

We collect the epidemic data up to county level in the US along with control measures and other local
information, such as socioeconomic status, demographic characteristics, healthcare infrastructure, and
other essential factors to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamic pattern of the spread of COVID-19. Our
data covers about 3,200 county-equivalent areas from 50 US states and the District of Columbia. A
live version of the data analysis will be continually updated on our dashboard (https://covid19.
stat.iastate.edu) and our Github repository (https://github.com/covid19-dashboard-us/
cdcar). The sources and introductions for these data are detailed in Table 1.

Epidemic Data

The daily counts of cases and deaths of COVID-19 are crucial for understanding how this pandemic
is spreading. Thanks to the contribution of the data science communities across the world, multiple
sources are providing the COVID-19 data with different precision and focus. In our article, we consider

the reported cases from the following four sources: the NYT NYT (2020a), the Atlantic Atlantic (2020),
the JHU CSSE, JHU (2020), and the USAFacts USAFacts (2020). To clean the data, we first fetch data
from the above four sources and compile them into the same format for further comparison and crossvalidation. Then, we use the algorithms discussed in Section 4 to detect the anomalies in the data
sources and choose the one with the least anomalies for further repair.

2.2

Other Factors

When analyzing the reported cases of COVID-19, many other factors may also contribute to the temporal or spatial patterns; see the discussions in Wang et al. (2020a). For example, local features, like
socioeconomic and demographic factors, can dramatically influence the course of the epidemic, and
thus, the spread of the disease could vary dramatically across different geographical regions. Therefore, these datasets are also supplemented with the population information at the county level in our
repository. We further classify these factors into the following six groups.

2.2.1 Policy Data
In a race to stunt the spread of COVID-19, federal, state and local governments have issued various
executive orders. Government declarations are used to identify the dates that different jurisdictions
implemented various social distancing policies (emergency declarations, school closures, bans on large
gatherings, limits on bars, restaurants and other public places, the deployment of severe travel restrictions, and “stay-at-home” or “shelter-in-place” orders). For example, President Trump declared a state
of emergency on March 13, 2020, to enhance the federal government response to confront COVID-19.

5
Later in the past spring, at least 316 million people in at least 42 states, the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico were urged to stay home.
Since the late April, all 50 states in the US began to reopen successively, due to the immense
pressures of the crippled economy and anxious public. A state is categorized as “reopening” once its
stay-at-home order lifts, or once reopening is permitted in at least one primary sector (restaurants, retail
stores, personal care businesses), or once reopening is permitted in a combination of smaller sectors.
We compiled the dates of executive orders by checking national and state governmental websites, news
articles, and press releases.

2.2.2 Demographic Characteristics
In the demographic characteristics category, we consider the factors describing racial, ethnic, sexual,
and age structures. These variables are extracted from the 2010 Census U.S. Census Bureau (2020b),
and the 2010–2018 American Community Survey (ACS) Demographic and Housing Estimates U.S.
Census Bureau (2018).

2.2.3 Healthcare Infrastructure
We also incorporate several features related to the healthcare infrastructure at the county level in the
datasets, including the percent of persons under 65 years without health insurance, the local government
expenditures for health per capita, and total bed counts per 1, 000 population.

2.2.4 Socioeconomic Status
We consider diverse socioeconomic factors in the county level datasets. All of these factors collected
from 2005–2009 ACS five-year estimates U.S. Census Bureau (2020a).

2.2.5 Environmental Factor
We also collect environmental factors that might affect the spread of epidemics significantly, such as
the urban rate and crime rate.

2.2.6 Mobility
Another category of factors in the literature that affects the spread of infectious diseases significantly
is the mobility; for example, movements of people from neighborhoods. We collect the mobility data
from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

2.3

Geographic Information

The longitude and latitude of the geographic center for each county in the US are available in Gazetteer
Files U.S. Census Bureau (2019).

Comparison of the Epidemic Data

In this subsection, we assess the similarities and differences of the reported infection and death cases
from the previously mentioned four sources. The data collection sources and release times are indicated for each of the sources to help determine which factors may have an effect on the outcome of the
assessment. The NYT released daily data at the national, state, and county levels at noon of the following day before July 18, after which the release time changed to midnight. The Atlantic releases daily
state-level data along with testing, hospitalization, and recovery information, updated in the afternoon
of the following day. The COVID-19 Data Repository by the CSSE at JHU provides both state and
county-level data daily. JHU released data at midnight on and before April 22 and then changed the
release time to the early morning of the following day. USAFacts collects the county-level data in the
evening and releases them in the early morning of the following day (by 9 a.m. PST) USAFacts (2020).
Table 2 summarizes the differences among the four sources of data based on how the data are collected
and compiled.
Let K be the number of all available sources in the comparison. For the county level comparison,
K = 3 since the Atlantic does not provide county level data, while for the state level, K = 4. Let T
be the number of days observed, or the length of each time series. Let n be the number of counties or
(k)

states. For source k, k = 1, . . . , K, let Yit be the cumulative number of the reported cases of location
i on day t, where i = 1, . . . , n, t = 1, . . . , T . In the following, we define a dissimilarity measure to

where Y iT is used to mitigate the variability of the currently observed counts. Equation (1) provides
a measurement that effectively detects the counties and states with the most discrepancy between each
pair of sources and is meaningful in the comparison between different locations. In Figure 1 we present
the county map for infected and death counts collected from three data sources. In Figure 2 we present
the state map for infected and death counts collected from four data sources. Areas in dark blue in these
two figures are determined to be different between the corresponding pair of two sources. In the rest of
this section, we look further into the underlying reasons for dissimilarity at the county and state levels.
We list the ten most dissimilar counties in a pairwise comparison of the three sources, in terms of
infection and death counts, in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The specific reasons for these dissimilarities
vary over locations. For the state of New York, the difference between sources is caused by different
geographical assignments. NYT and JHU combine Kings, Queens, Bronx, and Richmond counties
with New York City while USAFacts does not use that combination. For the state of Utah, JHU com-

on the death certificates since May 16. This number is significantly lower
than deaths among infected. The Atlantic uses deaths where COVID-19 is
listed on death certificates, while the other three sources use deaths among
infected. This unveils different definitions of probable deaths applied by
the four sources.

bines counties to jurisdictions to be consistent with the official state source, while NYT and USAFacts
provide county-level data. For Guam, NYT includes the data reported from USS Theodore Roosevelt,
while JHU and USAFacts do not. In Michigan, NYT considers federal and state prison inmates’ data
when reporting at the county-level, while the other two sources do not. For the state of Alaska, NYT
and JHU include non-resident cases while USAFacts does not. For some states, such as Kentucky,
Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington, Georgia and Tennessee, the official county-level data is subject to
frequent adjustments, which can lead to discrepancies when one source corrects the errors while other
sources do not. In summary, the county-level dissimilarities between data sources are mostly caused by
different geographical rules, non-resident data, prison inmates data, and differed efforts in correcting
the historical data.

Next, we look into the state-level comparison. According to our measure, using data up until July
25, 2020, states that show dissimilar infection data are illustrated in Figure 2. Here we list out a few
examples about how the dissimilarities arise. On the one hand, different responses to the change of
probable cases reporting mechanisms in infections and/or deaths lead to discrepancies in the reported
cases between the four sources. For instance, Wyoming started to include probable cases in their
infected cases reporting during the week of April 6th. Each of the four sources responded to the change
at different dates, as indicated by the jumps in data shown in Figure 3, with NYT being the first source
to respond to the change; see Figure 3 (e). Similarly, Michigan started reporting probable cases and
deaths after April 5. This resulted in higher infection counts in Atlantic for the following three months,
probably due to a correction for probable cases; see Figure 3 (a) and (b). As demonstrated in the time
series plots of Indiana in Figure 3 (c) and (d), inclusion or exclusion of probable cases also caused

differences in reported cases of both infections and deaths among the four sources. Another difference
among sources is caused by whether cases are reported according to the residence or the place of
infection/death. For example, when reporting the death cases of New York, the Atlantic uses New
York State reported deaths, while the other three sources use New York City reported deaths, which
also reports deaths of residents that occur outside New York City. Starting August 6, NYT switched
to reporting deaths by residence to make New York State death data consistent with the other states,
which led to discontinuity on August 6. To summarize, the state-level dissimilarities are mainly caused
by different report mechanisms to probable cases and varied choices of the geographical assignment.
Based on these examples, it is safe to conclude that the differences in reported cases do not indicate
the inferiority or superiority of the source per se. No matter which source we use, we need to be
clear and careful about the processing behind it. Generally speaking, despite the geographical rules,
USAFacts tends to be more conservative because it reports confirmed counts instead of the sum of
confirmed and probable counts in several states, and NYT tends to report higher county-level counts by
including non-resident data and prison inmates data.

COVID-19 Time Series: Features and Anomaly Detection
4.1

A Seven-day Cycle in Infection and Death Cases

We observe a seven-day cycle in (i) reported COVID-19 new cases, and in (ii) reported COVID-19 new
deaths at the national and state level. To rigorously test the seven-day cycle, we conduct the hypothesis
test using the R package seastests (function isSeasonal) Ollech (2019). By default, it implements the “WO-test”, an overall seasonality test scheme proposed in Webel and Ollech (2018). Given

13
a set of various seasonality tests, the WO-test first conducts a recursive feature elimination algorithm
in conditional random forests to identify the most informative candidate tests. Then the p-values from
the selected tests are used again as predictors to grow a single conditional inference tree. The candidate
tests may include a variety of seasonality tests tailored to particular manifestations, such as the modified
QS test, the Friedman test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, the periodogram test, and the Welch test.
We first conduct seasonality tests on the time series of national confirmed cases and deaths. Both
time series show a seven-day seasonal behavior with p-values less than 10−7 from a variety of tests,
including the QS test, the Friedman test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Then, we compare the different
tests on state-level infected cases and deaths. The results are summarized in Table 5, where we use a
checkmark to signify a significant test result at significance level of 0.05. For the infected cases, all the
tests suggest a significant seven-day cyclical pattern in 22 states. Meanwhile, we observe 27 states for
which all the tests suggest a significant seven-day cyclical pattern on the death time series.
The cyclical pattern is less evident at the county level. After applying the Friedman test to more
than 3,000 counties, 701 counties show the seven-day cyclical pattern in infected cases with p-value
smaller than 0.05. For the deaths, only 200 counties exhibit a cyclical behavior with p-value smaller
than 0.05.
The stacked column bar plots in Figure 4 show the day on which the most infection/death cases
are reported for each week in each state. From Figure 4 (a), we can observe that in the states, such as
North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, Saturdays usually report the most infections. States such
as Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, report more infection cases on Fridays. For death cases,
many states reach their peak on Tuesdays; see Figure 4 (b) for more details.
The stacked column bar plots in Figure 5 illustrate the day on which the highest infection/death
cases are reported for each week from March 15 to July 25. From Figure 5 (a), one can see that in
the early stage of the pandemic (before April), Saturdays usually had the highest number of infections. Later on, Fridays often had the most infections. As seen in Figure 5 (b), Sundays and Mondays
typically reported a smaller number of death counts than the other days. Meanwhile, the peaks often
occured on either Tuesdays or Wednesdays. In time series analysis, for a short-term forecast, a few
approaches can be considered to remove the weekly cycle: simple differencing (Yt − Yt−7 ); seven-day
moving average; using dummy variables control for day-to-day variation; harmonic function (series of
sine/cosine functions).

4.2

Anomaly Detection

In addition to the exciting findings aforementioned in the raw data collection, we observe two major
types of anomalies in the data: (I) order dependencies violation, and (II) point anomalies. Examples
of these two issues are illustrated in Figure 6. Before conducting any analysis of the epidemic data,
one might need to account for these issues. In this section, we use the epidemic data from NYT as an

Order dependency (OD) is widely used in the relational database. In this project, we incorporate this
concept into the anomaly detection and data repairing process of cumulative time series. To be more

specific, the OD for the cumulative time series can be defined as follows: for any two time points, t1
and t2 , if t1 < t2 , then Yt1 ≤ Yt2 , where Yt represents the cumulative infection/death count on day t.
Obviously, the time series in Figure 6 (a) violates the OD.

4.2.2 Point Anomalies
A point anomaly refers to the situation where there is one day of an abrupt increase in the cumulative
or daily new time series. This can also be considered as a violation of speed constraints. The anomaly
can be caused by a number of factors, including (1) the result of a large batch of tests was released
and (2) the change of reporting standard, such as some states starting to report probable cases from a
specific date. For example, the anomaly in Figure 6 (c) is due to New Jersey reporting 1,854 probable
deaths that may date back to earlier in the outbreak. The anomaly in Figure 6 (d) might be related to
the reported cases in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ). On May 31, at least 82 of the
active cases in the county were TDCJ-related. To detect this type of anomaly, we exam the increasing

speed of the time series. Specifically, if the time series Yti satisfies some speed constraint (SC), then,
(Yt2 − Yt1 )/(t2 − t1 ) < SC1 and

(Yt1 +1 − Yt1 )
< SC2 ,
(Yt2 − Yt1 ) /(t2 − t1 )

where SC1 and SC2 are two predetermined thresholds.

4.3

Change Points in Time Series

Sometimes, we may experience a pattern change in the time series, which can be referred to as the
period when the increasing speed is significantly different from the previous period. We apply the
function segmented in R package segmented Muggeo (2020) to detect the change points. This
function implements the segmented models in which the relationship between response and covariate(s)
is modeled as piecewise linear segments connected at some joint points (or change points). Once a
change point is detected, we will provide a warning message to let the user decide whether any repair
is necessary.
For simplicity, we consider a segmented relationship between the response and the time. Let µi =
E(Yti ), and the variable (time) ti is modeled by g(µi ) = β1 ti + β2 (ti − φ)+ , where g(·) is the link
function, (ti − φ)+ = (ti − φ)I(ti > φ), and I(·) is the indicator function. Here, β1 illustrates the slope
of left line segment and β2 represents the difference-in-slopes. The main idea lies in testing whether
|β2 | > 0. If a break-point does not exist, the difference-in-slopes parameter has to be zero. Table 6
presents the states in which change points are detected in daily new infections and deaths, and the dates
of the change points are identified. Figure 7 visualizes the identified change points together with the
time series of daily new infections and deaths. Based on the change point analysis, most of the changes
occurred in June and July with sudden increases in incident cases and death.

Data Repairing

Once raw data is collected, we start with the OD violation detection and repairing. Next, we check for
the point anomalies, and let the user decide whether to repair it. Last, we investigate the weekly cycles
and pattern changes in the time series. In this section, we propose several data repairing methods to handle the issues mentioned in Section 4. To resolve these issues, we focus on the daily new infected/death

cases instead of the cumulative infected/death cases. In the following, we let Zt = Yt − Yt−1 be the
increase at time point t.

5.1

Anomaly Repairing

First of all, the daily reported infected/death count could be considered as a count time series by nature. Therefore, when repairing a count time series, we need to take into account that the observations
are nonnegative integers, and we should utilize the dependence structure among observations. Furthermore, in the study of the infectious disease, the population is usually assigned to compartments such
as Susceptible (S), Infectious (I), or Recovered (R), and people may progress between compartments.
Therefore, different compartments are usually considered as an entire system and are studied together;
see for example, the SIR models Allen et al. (2008); Lawson et al. (2016); Pfeiffer et al. (2008). Third,
the spread of the disease also has a spatial pattern. In general, once a point anomaly is detected, we let
A = {t ∈ T : Zt is identified as a point anomaly}. For t ∈ A, the user can decide whether a correction
bt ,
is necessary. If so, the user can choose from the following methods to obtain a more reliable value, Z
to replace the point anomaly Zt .

5.1.1 Time Series Model for Count Data
One of the conventional methods to deal with these challenges is the generalized linear model (GLM),
which models the observations conditionally on past information. In this project, we consider both
Poisson and Negative Binomial as the conditional distribution. The second important class for analyzing count time series is the integer autoregressive moving average models, and a comprehensive review
is given by Weiß (2008). The state-space is another type of count time series models. Comparing with
the GLM, it allows a more flexible data generating process. However, it requires a more complicated
model specification. Due to the explicit formulation, the GLM-based models yield a more convenient
way to make predictions. Thus, in this project, we focus on the GLM-based method.
To repair the dataset, we model the conditional mean µt = E(Zt |Zt−1 , µt−1 ) in the following form
νt = β0 +

p
X
k=1

βk Zt−k +

αl νt−l ,

l=1

where νt = log (µt ).
For this type of data repairing, we use the R package tscount Liboschik et al. (2017), which
conducts a model estimation by the quasi-conditional maximum likelihood method (function tsglm).

5.1.2 Combined Linear and Exponential Predictors
The second method we consider is the combined linear and exponential predictors models proposed in
Altieri et al. (2020), which assembles the following three different models.
1. An individual county-/state-level exponential predictor: model (2) uses a series of separate pre-

21
dictors for each county to capture the reported exponential growth of COVID-19 infected and
death counts, and we assume
log {E(Zt |t)} = β0 + β1 t,

(2)

where the parameters β0 and β1 are the coefficients in the generalized linear model (GLM) using
glm function in R with a log link function.
2. An individual county-/state-level linear predictor: model (3) fits a linear version of the separate
county predictors; specifically, we assume that:
E(Zt |t) = β0 + β1 t.

(3)

3. An individual county-/state-level exponential epidemic predictor: model (4) uses a series of
disease related factors to capture the reported exponential growth of COVID-19 infectious and
death counts. We assume that
log {E(Zt |Zt−1 )} = β0 + β1 log (Zt−1 + 1).

(4)

5.1.3 Spatio-temporal Epidemic Model
Based on the idea of the SIR models, this paper (Wang et al., 2020e) proposes the discrete-time spatial
epidemic model, which combines the susceptible state, infectious state, and removed state together.
In the following, we denote Iit , Dit , and Rit the cumulative number of cases in infected, death and
R
recovered states, respectively, in county i observed on day t. Let µIi,t , µD
i,t , µi,t be the conditional mean

value of daily new positive cases, deaths and recovery cases, respectively, which can be modeled via a
link function g as follows:
I
I
g(µIi,t ) = β0t
(loni , lati ) + β1t
(loni , lati ) log (Ii,t−1 ),
D
D
g(µD
i,t ) = β0t (loni , lati ) + β1t (loni , lati ) log (Ii,t−1 ),
R
R
µR
i,t = β0t + β1t Ii,t−1 .

In practice, one can use the bivariate spline over triangulation to approximate the spatially varying
coefficient functions, β0t (loni , lati ) and β1t (loni , lati ). The triangulation can be obtained through various software packages; see for example, the Matlab code DistMesh, and the R package Triangulation
Wang and Lai (2020). Based on a triangulation, the bivariate spline basis can be generated via the
R package BPST Wang et al. (2020b). The entire estimation procedure is completed using a quasilikelihood approach via the penalized spline approximation and an iteratively reweighted least-squares
technique; see details in Wang et al. (2020e).

5.2

Outlier Correction

The consequences of outliers may result in reduced forecast accuracy due to (1) bias in the estimates
of model parameters and (2) a carry-over effect of the outlier on the prediction. Consequently, the
reported data (i.e., infection, death, and recovery) should undergo a preprocessing step to lessen the
impact of inaccurate data or anomalies. Therefore, outlier detection and correction are vital for time
series analysis based on the reported COVID-19 data.
A simple solution to lessen the impact of an outlier is to replace the outlier with a more typical value
before generating the forecasts. This process is often referred to as “Outlier Correction”. Traditionally,
an outlier usually occurs due to measurement variability, data entry, or experimental error. Once an
outlier is detected, especially for the ones resulted from the experimental error, we sometimes exclude
them from the dataset. However, the outliers in COVID-19 epidemic data typically occur for specific
reasons, such as the release of a large batch of tests and the change of reporting standards. Simply
excluding extreme values solely due to their extremeness can distort the data analysis. Therefore,
the outlier correction procedure should be different from the traditional ones. In this subsection, we
describe an automated procedure for “correcting” the history before forecasting. For a count time series
{Zt }Tt=1 , we assume that M outliers, {Ztm }M
m=1 , have been detected, then we implement Algorithm 1
for the repairing procedure. Figure 8 illustrates some examples of the outlier correction.

Technical Validation and Usage Notes

The entire detection and repairing procedure is illustrated in Figure 9. First of all, we obtained the data
from all of the four data sources, and use the dissimilarity measure proposed in the above to compare

them. We visualize and check the difference at the state level among different data sources based
on the comparison results. For the county-level data, we calculate the measure and report the top 10
counties, which are the most different pairwisely. Then, all the data are processed with all types of
anomaly detection discussed in Section 4.2. Once an anomaly has been detected, a warning will be
given automatically by R package cdcar. We handle different types of anomalies depending on the
circumstances. For example, if an order dependency violation is detected, we will repair that point
using our data repairing algorithms proposed in Section 5.1. If a point anomaly is detected, we first
manually check possible legitimate reasons based on news and social media. If correction is necessary,
we will repair the point anomalies using the proposed algorithm, see Algorithm 1.
The integrated data are openly available to assist researchers to investigate the spread of COVID-19
in the US. We will continue to provide the cleaned data as the pandemic progresses. Despite the fact
we try our best in the data curation, there are two issues without a perfect solution now, but requires
attention from the users when they try to draw conclusive statements using the data.
1. Probable versus Confirmed Cases. Excluding the population with symptoms but not confirmed
by tests leads to the under-reported issue of infectious counts. On April 5, 2020, the Council of
State and Territorial Epidemiologists released an interim Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (2020) related to the COVID-19 reporting. It requires the local or state public
health authority to submit a report of a condition to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within 24 hours, and CDC should publish data for both “Confirmed” and “Probable”
cases in the CDC Print Criteria. Before the interim was released, most of the states primarily

25
reported confirmed cases. For the states and counties which started to report probable cases,
thereafter, the count of the cases would incur an unavoidable jump after including the probable
cases.
2. Antibody Test versus Virus Test. In general, there are two types of tests on infection; one is
an antibody test, and the other is a virus test (also referred to as the PCR test). Unfortunately, in
many datasets, the type of reported tests is not specified. Those tested positive for the virus are
infected at the moment and suggested to be quarantined to avoid infecting others. Meanwhile,
those tested positive on an antibody test must have been exposed to the virus, but there is no
indication of whether they are still infectious or recovered The U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (2020). In addition, the antibody tests are known to be much less accurate.
Mixing these two tests makes positive cases uninterpretable. Some states and counties have
started to separate antibody tests from virus tests Madrigal and Meyer (2020), while states such
as Pennsylvania, Texas, Georgia, and Vermont did not specify the type of tests.
We will continue to keep close track of the data sources we depend on, and update our datasets
regularly. We strongly encourage users of our datasets to contact us if there is any anomaly or error.

Conclusion and Discussion

The COVID-19 pandemic is generating enormous amounts of data. Open-access data with high quality
are critical for the COVID-19 scientific research and response efforts. This paper compares and integrates different data sources and provides a semiotic-based framework for understanding the reported
cases’ data quality and the techniques for anomaly detection and anomaly repairing.
Correcting the history for severe outliers or anomalies will often improve the forecast; however, if
the outlier is not genuinely severe, corrections might make the history smoother than it actually was,
which will change the forecasts and narrow the confidence intervals. If the correction was not necessary,
it might lead to poor forecasts and unrealistic confidence intervals. We suggest using a high threshold
for anomaly detection. In addition, the detected outliers should ideally be individually reviewed by the
forecaster, and the reasons for the outliers should be investigated to determine whether a correction is
appropriate.
For public usage, all code regarding the proposed anomaly detection and repairing algorithms is
built in R package cdcar. The package and the cleaned data that are regularly updated can be found
in the Github repository (https://github.com/covid19-dashboard-us/cdcar).
Some aspects of our data comparison and curation methods are constrained by the official information released, and we will continuously investigate. First of all, some data are not retrievable at

26
the county level, such as the recovery data and the face mask data. Second, the data reporting protocols are not consistent, especially for the recoveries. Third, although we discover the cyclical pattern
in the epidemic data, the related reason still needs to be examined. Fourth, the unassigned issue and
under-reported issue might be some other important problems under the pandemic without detailed
discussion. In the future, we plan to overcome the data sharing barrier and extend our US COVID-19
database to a worldwide database.

Appendix. Data Records
A.1

Epidemic Data

Using the algorithm discussed in Section 5, we aggregate the reported COVID-19 infected, death,
and recovered cases from January 22, 2020 from (1) the NYT NYT (2020a), (2) the Atlantic Atlantic
(2020), (3) the COVID-19 Data Repository from the JHU CSSE, JHU (2020), and (4) the USAFacts
USAFacts (2020). These daily updated epidemic datasets are available on Github repository https:
//github.com/covid19-dashboard-us/cdcar.
In the state level epidemic data, we include the following variables. Among those variables, the variable
State can be used as the key for data merge.
1. State – Name of state. There are 48 mainland US states and the District of Columbia.
2. XYYYY.MM.DD – Cumulative infection or death cases related to the date of YYYY.MM.DD.
YYYY, MM, and DD represent year, month and day, respectively. It starts from X2020.01.22.
For example, the variable X2020.01.22 is either infection or death cases in a certain state (State)
on 01/22/2020.
For county-level data, two more county-specific variables are included. As the key of this table, variable
ID can be used for future data merge.
1. ID – County-level Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) code, which uniquely identifies the geographic area. The number has five digits, of which the first two are the FIPS code of
the state to which the county belongs.
2. County – Name of county matched with ID. There are about 3,200 counties and county-equivalents
(e.g. independent cities, parishes, boroughs) in the US.
3. State – Name of state matched with ID. There are 50 states and the District of Columbia in the
US.
4. XYYYY.MM.DD – Cumulative infection or death cases related to the date of YYYY.MM.DD.
YYYY, MM, and DD represent year, month and day, respectively. It starts from X2020.01.22.
For example, the variable X2020.01.22 is either infection or death cases in a certain (County)
on 01/22/2020.

A.2

Other Factors

A.2.1 Policy Data
We release two datasets for the “stay-at-home/shelter-in-place” order and the declaration of “state of
emergency” from (1) Business Insider Perper et al. (2020), (2) New York Times NYT (2020b), and

28
additional local news.
1. ID – County-level Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) code, which uniquely identifies the geographic area. The number has five digits, of which the first two are the FIPS code of
the state to which the county belongs.
2. County – Name of county matched with ID. There are about 3,200 counties and county-equivalents
(e.g. independent cities, parishes, boroughs) in the US.
3. State – Name of state matched with ID. There are 50 states and the District of Columbia in the
US.
4. XYYYY.MM.DD – Indicators for whether the policy is in effect on the date of YYYY.MM.DD,
1 indicates the policy is in effect, 0 otherwise. YYYY, MM, and DD represent year, month and
day, respectively. It starts from X2020.01.22. For example, the variable X2020.01.22 represents
whether the policy is in effect in a certain (County) on 01/22/2020.

A.2.2 Demographic Characteristics
In the demographic characteristics category, we consider the factors describing racial, ethnic, sexual,
and age structures. Specifically, we include the following six variables. Among these six variables,
AA PCT and HL PCT are obtained from the 2010 Census U.S. Census Bureau (2020b). The other
four variables are extracted from the 2010–2018 American Community Survey (ACS) Demographic
and Housing Estimates U.S. Census Bureau (2018).
1. AA PCT – The percent of the population who identify as African American;
2. HL PCT – The percent of the population who identify as Hispanic or Latino;
3. Old PCT – The percent of aged people (age ≥ 65 years);
4. Sex ratio – The ratio of male over female;
5. PD log – The logarithm of the population density per square mile of land area;
Pop log – The logarithm of local population;
6. Mortality – The five-year (1998-2002) average mortality rate, measured by the total counts of
deaths per 100, 000 population in a county.

29
A.2.3 Healthcare Infrastructure
We incorporated three features related to the healthcare infrastructure at the county level in the datasets.
Among these variables, NHIC PCT is available in the USA Counties Database U.S. Census Bureau
(2011), EHPC is obtained from Economic Census 2012 U.S. Census Bureau (2012), and TBed is
compiled from Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-level Data U.S. Department of Homeland Security
(2020).
1. NHIC PCT – the percent of persons under 65 years without health insurance;
2. EHPC – the local government expenditures for health per capita;
3. TBed – total bed counts per 1, 000 population.

A.2.4 Socioeconomic Status
We consider diverse socioeconomic factors in the county level datasets. All of these factors collected
from 2005–2009 ACS 5-year estimates U.S. Census Bureau (2020a). We also calculate the Gini coefficient based on the household income data from the 2005–2009 ACS U.S. Census Bureau (2020a) to
measure the income inequality.
1. Affluence – Social affluence generated by factor analysis from HighIncome, HighEducation,
WCEmployment and MedHU;
2. HIncome PCT – The percent of families with annual incomes higher than $75,000;
3. HEducation PCT – The percent of the population aged 25 years or older with a bachelor’s
degree or higher;
4. MedHU – The median value of owner-occupied housing units;
5. Disadvantage – Concentrated disadvantage obtained by factor analysis from HHD PAI PCT,
HHD F PCT and Unemployment PCT;
6. HHD PAI PCT – The percent of the households with public assistance income;
7. HHD F PCT – The percent of households with female householders and no husband present;
8. Unemployment PCT – Civilian labor force unemployment rate;
9. Gini – The Gini coefficient, a measure for income inequality and wealth distribution in economics.

30
A.2.5 Environmental Factor
We also collect some environmental factors that might affect the spread of epidemics significantly, such
as the urban rate and crime rate.
1. UrbanRate – Urban rate U.S. Census Bureau (2020b);
2. ViolentCrime – The total number of violent crimes per 1, 000 population U.S. Census Bureau
(2011);
3. PropertyCrime – The total number of property crimes per 1, 000 population U.S. Census Bureau (2011);
4. ResidStability – The percent of the population residence in the same house for one year and
over U.S. Census Bureau (2020b).

A.2.6 Mobility
The mobility data are collected from the US Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics. It describes the daily number of trips within each county, which are produced from an
anonymized national panel of mobile device data from multiple sources. Trips are defined as movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home.
1. Number of trips X – XX – Number of trips by residents greater than X miles and shorter than
XX miles. There are 10 different trip ranges: “ ≤ 1” “1 – 3”, “3 – 5”, “5–10”, “10 – 25”, “25 –
50” “50 – 100”, “100 – 250”, “250 – 500”, and “ ≥ 500”.
2. Population Stay at Home – Number of residents staying at home, that is, persons who make no
trips with a trip end more than one mile away from home.

A.3

Geographic Information

The longitude and latitude of the geographic center for each county in the US are available in Gazetteer
Files U.S. Census Bureau (2019).
