Abstract
Since March 2020, the environment surrounding football has changed dramatically because of the
COVID-19 pandemic. After a few months’ break, re-scheduled matches were held behind closed doors
without spectators. The main objective of this study is a quantitative evaluation of “crowd effects”
on home advantage, using the results of these closed matches. The proposed analysis uses pairwise
comparison method to reduce the effects caused by the unbalanced schedule. The following conclusions
were drawn from the statistical hypothesis tests conducted in this study: In four major European leagues,
the home advantage is reduced in closed matches compared to than in the normal situation, i.e., with
spectators. The reduction amounts among leagues were different. For example, in Germany, the home
advantage was negative during the closed-match period. On the other hand, in England, statistically
significant differences in home advantage were not observed between closed matches and normal situation.

I. Introduction
Sice March 2020, the environment surrounding football has changed dramatically — because of
the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to many other crowd-pleasing events, most football leagues
were suspended. Some of the leagues had even been calcelled, whereas others resumed after
a few months’ break. With regard to the resumed leagues, however, no decision as before the
suspension, has been announced. Re-scheduled matches have therefore been held behind closed
doors without spectators.
The objective of this study was to analyze how this unfortunate closed-match situation affected the match outcomes of football. In particular, our main objective was a quantitative evaluation of “crowd effects” on home advantage.
Today, the existence of “home advantage” in sports, especially football, seems unquestionable
[1][2][3]. However, definitive evidence on the factors that produce home advantage remains
elusive. Of course, the quantitative impact of each of these factors on home advantage has also
been discussed.
“Home advantage” can be defined as the benefit that induces home teams to consistently win
more than 50 percent of the games under a balanced home-and-away schedule [4]. Quantitative
research on home advantage in football dates back nearly 40 years to Morris [5], followed by
Dowie [6] and Pollard [2]. In a very brief and thorough review paper on home advantage [7],
consisting of only three pages, Pollard presented eight main factors that could generate home
1

advantage and explained conventional studies for each (of course, he did not forget to mention
interactions and other factors). The first one is “’crowd effect,” i.e, effect caused by spectators. In
[7], he wrote, “This is the most obvious factor involved with home advantage and one that fans
certainly believe to be dominant [8][9].” Studies by Dowie [6] and Pollard [2] were also able to
find very little evidence that home advantage depends on crowd density (spectators per stadium
capacity).
This study utilizes the results of matches conducted behind closed doors during the COVID19 pandemic to determine the relationship between the presence of spectators and home advantage. A similar study had already been performed by Reade et al., who used the results of
matches conducted behind closed doors since 2003 and reported the results of their investigation
on crowd effect [10]. The number of matches in empty studiums, however, were small (160, out
of approximately 34 thousand matches). In addition, in these closed matches, teams were banned
from admitting supporters into their stadiums typically as punishments for bad behavior off the
football pitch (e.g., bacause of corruption, racist abuse, or violence). Therefore, in this analysis,
the characteristics of the spectators could biased, e.g., they were excessively violent or exhibiting
overly aggressive supporting behavior.
When the results of closed matches are used in such a study, it should also be noted that
the schedule is unbalanced. For example, many European league matches were already approximately two-thirds completeed by the mid-March suspension. Therefore, a possible bias for the
strength of home teams in the resumed matches after the break should be considered. By contrast, most famous and extensive previous studies on home advantage [11] and the most recent
report [12] used only a number of basic statistics, e.g., numbe of goals, fouls, and wins. These
data could be biased if obtained under an unbalanced schedule.
For the problem on biased schedule, in this study, a statistical model that deremines match
results based on the team strength parameters for each team and a home advantage parameter
that is common for every team in the league was assumed. Through the fitting the parameters
in this model to minimize explanation error, the home advantage was separated even when the
schedule was unbalanced.
The specific techniques used in this study were as follows: Each team i had one strength
evaluation value ri , referred to as the“rating.” Furthurmore, each league had one parameter,
rhomeAdv, that expressed the home advantage. The strength difference ∆r was defined as the
difference in rating values between the teams, indexed by i and j, added to the home advantage,
i.e., ∆r = ri + rhomeAdv − r j . The strength difference then explained the score ratio in a match via
logistic regression model, i.e., 1/(1 + exp(−∆r )).
The rating values ri and the home advantage value rhomeAdv at a particular date were estimated
using the most recent match results, e.g., for five matchweeks. This calculation process was
repeated for every matchweek. The home advantage values estimated only from the closed
matches were then compared to those from past “normal” match results.
This paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the data and the detailed algorithm
used in this study. An analysis on the five major top divisions of European football leagues, i.e.,
England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain (in France, the top division has not resumed after
suspension), is then presented. The match results were collected from 2010–2011 season. Section
III then discusses statistical analysis. The following conclusions were able to be drawn from the
statistical hypothesis tests that were performed in this study.
• In the four major European leagues that were examined, the home advantage was reduced
when there were no spectators compared to that for a normal situation,i.e., with spectators.
• The reduction amounts among the leagues were different.
• For all four leagues, the home advantage remained even in closed matches.

Lastly, Section IV summarizes and concludes this paper.

II. Methods
In this section, the leagues that were investigated and the content of the used data are described.
A mathematical method for estimating home advantage is then explained.

This study analyzed the home advantage among the top divisions in five European countries, i.e., England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, which are considered as the most major
and highest-quality football leagues around the world. The match results from the 2010/11 season were collected from worldfootball.net (https://www.worldfootball.net/). The number of
matches analyzed was 17729, including 430 closed matches.
All five leagues were suspended from mid-March because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Four
of the leagues, i.e., excluding France, resumed by late June, and finished by early August. Ligue 1
in France, on the other hand, quickly decided and announced its cancellation at the end of April
[13].

Mathematical model

We propose a unified and simple statistical estimation method for scoring ratios based on the
scores in each match, which are always officially recorded and are subject to a scoring system
common to all the games. This method extends [14] by incorporating home advantage. The study
3

[14] reported that this proposed method achieved higher prediction accuracies for ten events of
five sports, i.e., basketball, handball, hockey, volleyball, and water polo, in the Rio Olympic
Games compared to those of official world rankings.
The scoring ratio of a home team i in a match against an away team j (i and j are team indices),
denoted as pi,j, is estimated as follows:
pi,j =

1
1+e

−(r i +r homeAdv−r j )

,

(1)

where ri is defined as the rating of team i, and rhomeAdv is the quantitative value of home advantage.
Given (si , s j ), the actual scores in a match between i and j,
si,j =

si + 1
= pi,j + ǫi,j ,
si + 1 + s j + 1

(2)

where si,j and ǫi,j are the modified actual scoring ratio and the estimation error, respectively. In
football, shut-out results such as 1 − 0 or 3 − 0 occur frequently. Thus, a simple scoring ratio,
si
i.e., si,j = s +
s , can result in an invalid strength evaluation. Therefore, the score of each team is
i

j

increased by one. This modification is known as Colley’s method [15], and was originally used
to rank college (American) football teams.
This mathematical structure is the well-known logistic regression model. It is widely used in
areas such as the winning probability assumption of Elo ratings in chess games [16], and the
correct answer probability for questions in item response theory [17].
The update method is designed to minimize the sum of the squared error E2 between the
result and the prediction , defined by the following equation:
E2 =

∑

(si,j − pi,j )2 .

(3)

( i,j )∈all matches

It is straightforward to obtain the following update based on the steepest-descent method:
ri ← ri − α ·

∂E2
∂E2
, rhomeAdv ← rhomeAdv − α ·
,
∂ri
∂rhomeAdv

(4)

where α is a constant.
By definition, the rating is an interval scale. Therefore, its origin, r = 0, can be selected
arbitrarily, and a constant value can be added to all ri . For example,
r ← r − (max r ) · 1

(5)

implies that r = 0 is always the highest rating, whereas r < 0 is the distance from the top team.
ii.1 Conversion of rating on scoring ratio to winning probability
The rating ri in (1) determines the scoring ratio. Once we have the scoring ratio p i,j given in (1),
the following independent Bernoulli process is executed N times, starting from (si , s j ) = (0, 0)
and with the parameter 0 < β ≤ 1:

with probability βpi,j ,
 si ← si + 1

sj ← sj + 1
with probability β 1 − pi,j ,
(6)

si ← si , s j ← s j with probability (1 − β) .
4

This is a unified (and approximated) model of a scoring process for all ball games, where si and
s j model the scores of teams i and j, respectively.
The parameters N and β vary among the sports and between definitions of a unit of play.
For example, in basketball, if a unit of play is defined as 10 [s], we have N = 40[min] ×
60[s/min]/10[s] = 240. In football, if a unit of play is defined as 1 [min], we have N = 90.
For both sports, β is determined to be β = E(si + s j )/N.
At the end of the match, si > s j indicates that team i wins against team j. Figure 1 shows the
simulated winning probability for different values of Nβ and rating gap (ri − r j ), with N = 240.
This probability is expressed by as a cumulative distribution function for a normal distribution.
In many applications, it is common to use a logistic regression model rather than a cumulative
distribution [18].

Rating Gap

Figure 1: Winning probability with respect to rating gap

Based on the previous discussions, we convert the rating on the scoring ratio to that of a
winning probability, as follows:
wi,j = 1 (i wins), 0.5 (draw), or 0 ( j wins),

(7)

which denotes a win, draw, or loss, respectively, for team i against team j. Afterward, Dk∗ , where
k is an index of sports, that satisfies
ŵi,j =

is obtained. ri is then converted as follows:
r̄i = Dk∗ ri , i = 1, 2, · · · , NT , and homeAdv,

(10)

where NT denotes the number of teams. Therefore, r̄homeAdv is a quantitative home advantage
estimation that explains the effect on the winning probability.
In Equations (3) and (9), the sum of squared errors, instead of the cross-entropy, is used as a
loss function. This is because these problems are regression problems, not classification ones.

iii.

Short-term estimation of home advantage

The proposed method in the previous section was used to estimate the rating of each team and the
home advantage in the league for every matchweek using the results of the last five matchweeks,
including itself.
By using five matchweeks, we were able to estimate the average of each team’s strength and
league-wide home advantage over periods ranginf from approximately three weeks to one month.
The calculated home advantage was classified into the following four classes based on spectator attendance.
• Past: The home advantage calculated using the matches from the 2010/11 to the 2018/19
seasons. This value includes closed matches as punishments, if they exist.
• Normal: The home advantage calculated using the matches before suspension in the 2019/20
season. These matches all included live spectators. Note that closed matches as punishments are also inclused here, if they exist.
• Mixed: The home advantage calculated using both the matches that included spectators
and those without spectators.
• Closed: The home advantage calculated using the matches without spectators.

III. Results and discussions
This chapter describes the analysis results and discussions.

i.

Basic statistics

Figure 2 depicts the basic statistics, e.g., goals difference per match and win ratio difference, in
normal and closed-match periods.
According to these data, home teams goaled approximately from 0.3 to 0.5 more per match
than away teams on average under “past and normal” situations. As a result, home teams won
approximately 0.15 to 0.25 more against away teams. In addition, the home advantage was apparently reduced under closed-match situations. In particular, in Bundesliga, the goals difference
and win ratio difference were both negative in the closed matches. In this part of the study,
however, possible schedule unbalance for the closed matches was not considered. In other words,
it is possible that the most of the home teams were consistently weak (or strong) in the closed
matches.

ii.

Estimation of home advantage

Figure 3 shows the results of the estimation of home advantage r̄homeAdv for five leagues. The
medians were all positive for every four classes. This result indicates that the home advantage
remained even for matches that were closed and without spectators. The medians in the past
and normal periods appeared similar. On the other hand, the median in the closed period was
smaller than those of the past and normal periods.
We tested a null hypothesis that the home advantage r̄homeAdv from two different categories
were samples from continuous distributions with equal medians. Wilcoxon’s rank sum test [19,
20] was used as a test method because any assumption on the shape of the distribution of r̄homeAdv
could be posed. The p-values between classes are depicted in Figure 3, whereas the test results
are summarized in Table 3.
From these test results, the following can be concluded.

• There was no significant difference in home advantage between the past’s and 2019/20
season’s normal matches (p > 0.1).
• There was significant difference in home advantage between the normal and closed matches
( p < 10−3 ). The significantnce of the difference was even more obvious between the past
and closed matches (p < 10−6 ). The median of the home advantage in the closed matches
was clearly smaller.
Therefore, this study provides strong quantitative evidence of the impact of the crowd effect
on home advantage among the top leagues in Europe. It should be noted, however, that all of the
closed matches in this season have been with several months’ suspension, and conducted in the
summer, when matches are normally not played. Therefore, the possible effect of these factors
on the home advantage should not be neglected.

ii.1 Detailed analysis for each league
The previous section described the results for all five leagues. In this section, the estimation
results for each league will be explained. Table 4 lists the results of Wilcoxon’s rank sum test for
each league in detail. Figure 4 visualizes the number of home matches in the closed-match period.
The teams are ordered based on their the final standings. Figures 5 to 9 show the estimated value
of r homeAdv for each league from the 2010/11 season.
England In England, the home advantage value obtained via the proposed method for the
closed-match period had no significant difference to those of the past and normal periods. This
result demonstrates that the basic statistics, such as the goals difference and win ratio difference
shown in Figure 2, were smaller in the closed-match period because of the unbalanced schedule.
In other words, most of the home teams were consistently weak (or strong) in the closed
matches. Figure 4 supports this assertion. In England, there were weak correlation between the
number of home matches in the closed-match period and the final standings. The correlation
value was 0.4052. By constrast, for the other leagues, i.e., Germany, Italy, and Spain, the
correlation values were much smaller (0.2863, 0.0867, and −0.1561).
France In France, there was not a significant difference in r homeAdv between the past and normal
periods.
Germany In Germany, the home advantage value in the closed-match period had significant
difference to those in the past and normal periods. Both p-values were less than 1.00 × 10−2 . In
the closed-match period, Bundesliga demonstrated a home “dis”advantage, i.e., r homeAdv < 0.

Italy In Italy, the home advantage value obtained via the proposed method for the closed-match
period had no significant difference to those of the past period (p = 6.46 × 10−2 ). In this season,
the home advantage value was smaller even in the normal period.
Spain In Spain, the home advantage value in the closed-match period had significant difference
to those in the past and normal periods. Both p-values were less than 1.00 × 10−2. In the
closed-match period, similar to Bundesliga, LaLiga demonstrated home disadvantage.

IV. Conclusion
In this study, the results of matches conducted behind closed doors during the COVID-19
pandemic were used to determine the relationship between the presence of spectators and home
advantage. To reduce the effect of schedule unbalance in the closed-match period, this paper
proposed a short-term (e.g., five matchweeks) rating method that considers the home advantage.
The proposed method was applied to the match results in five major European football leagues
(England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) from the 2010/11 to the 2019/20 seasons.
The distributions of home advantage for both the past normal and closed-match periods were
calculated. Their median values were compared using statistical hypothesis tests. A null
hypothesis, “the home advantage r̄homeAdv from two different periods are samples from
continuous distributions with equal medians,” were rejected because of sufficiently small
p-value (p < 10−3). More simply, the home advantage became smaller when the games were
conducted behind closed doors
Our future work is to extend the proposed method to match results from all over the world.
This future study could then clarify the crowd effect on home advantage.
