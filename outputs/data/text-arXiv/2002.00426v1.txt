Abstract
In order to predict the development trend of the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCov), we
established an prediction model to predict the number of diagnoses case in China except
Hubei Province. From January 25 to January 29, 2020, we optimized 6 prediction models, 5
of them based on the number of medical observations to predicts the peak time of confirmed
diagnosis will appear on the period of morning of January 29 from 24:00 to February 2 before
5 o'clock 24:00. Then we tracked the data from 24 o'clock on January 29 to 24 o'clock on
January 31, and found that the predicted value of the data on the 3rd has a small deviation
from the actual value, and the actual value has always remained within the range predicted
by the comprehensive prediction model 6. Therefore we discloses this finding and will
continue to track whether this pattern can be maintained for longer. We believe that the
changes medical observation case number may help to judge the trend of the epidemic
situation in advance.

Background:
The 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCov) is currently raging in China and has a tendency to spread
to the world. The number of infections has skyrocketed since the first announcement on
December 31, 2019, and has spread to all provinces in China within 30 days. However, the
changing trend of transmission and the time when the climax comes still not clear yet. A
Correct prediction of the development trend of the epidemic is of great significance to reduce
the total number of infections and prevention of new infections and control disease spread.
In this study, we established a prediction model by analyzing the numerical regularity of the
data and the logical association of the indicators according to publicly reported data to
predict disease progression. It will contribute to the development of future strategies for
disease prevention and control.

Overall hypothesis
Assumption one:
The human trajectory is in a random state,the virus does not mutate, and the probability of
different patients infecting other people in the same period of time is close.

Assumption two:
Hubei Province is the place where proband cases occurred. In the early days of disaster
relief,resources were insufficient. Later, The government adopt a strict strategy that limit
citizen's mobility in Hubei province,including Wuhan city. This study intends to study the data
of Hubei Province, study the data of other provinces in China except Hubei Province, and infer
the disaster trend outside Hubei Province.

Assumption three:
The infection cases outside Hubei province are
homologous, the diagnosis standards are uniform across the provinces, and the

confirmed data are reliable and the data are regular.

Assumption four:
Most of the confirmedcases experienced medical observation at first.

Result
The results of the final prediction model established on January 29 based on the data
on January 28 at 24 o'clock are shown in Figure 1:

In order to verify the validity of the model, we observed the 24 o'clock data for three
days from January 29 to 31, 2020, all of which were within the forecast range, and
tended to be optimistic. The actual measurement situation is shown in Figure 2:

Data source and sampling instructions
The national data comes from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention [1], in
this study recorded as Ci , Ei ,Ti , R i , ùëÇi . The data of Hubei comes from the Health Commission
of Hubei Provice [2], in this study recorded as Hi . Both data sources released the outbreak
data at 24:00 on the previous day that morning. Scattered daily data of other channels are
not counted. Therefore, with the exception of Hubei Province, the total number of daily
diagnoses in China is: Ei = Ci ‚àí Hi .

Model 1: prediction based on fitting of confirmed data
The model was established on January 25, 2020. The model fits the data before January
25 by polynomial method, and infers the subsequent data. The fitting equation is:

1
y = ‚àí x 3 + 55.071x 2 ‚àí 105.6x + 116.8

where the data at 24 o'clock on January 25 is predicted to be x = 5. The prediction
curve is shown in Fig.3

Model 2: Superimposed prediction based on confirmed
data and actual deviation
After the first model was established, the three data at 24:00 on January 25-27 were
analyzed, and it was found that the actual data gradually deviated from the model.
Therefore, the newly obtained data is used for the secondary correction. When the
correction method is used, the deviation is fitted twice. The fitting equation is:

‚àÜy = ‚àí8x 2 ‚àí 48x + 54
where the data at 24 o'clock on January 25th is predicted to be x = 1. It will be
superimposed with model one. To get model two. The predicted image is shown in
Figure 4.

Model 5Ôºö Prediction model based on the case number of
medical observations
The model was established on January 28. The following assumptions been added in this
model.
ÔÅ¨ There are relationship between the number of new diagnose case and the
number of people undergoing medical observation the previous day. The daily
correlation can be described by Œµi , and the variation of Œµi can be described by
œÉ.
ÔÅ¨ There is relationship between the number of people undergoing medical
observation each day and the number of medical observations on the previous
day and the number of people who released from medical observations. The
correlation can be described by Œ≥, œÑ;
ÔÅ¨ There is relationship between the number of daily medical observations released
and the number of medical observations released the day before;
ÔÅ¨ The number of people being observed will not be less than 0.
th

It is deduced that the number of medical observations on the n day conforms to the
following model:
n

O n ÔÄΩ r nO 0 ÔÄ≠ ÔÅ¥R 0 ÔÉ• r n ÔÄ≠i ÔÅ¢ i
i ÔÄΩ1

The proportion of medical observations that are diagnosed daily can be calculated by model

as follow:

ÔÅ• n ÔÄΩ ÔÅ≥ nÔÅ• 0
The patient increase on day i corresponds to:
‚àÜi = max(Œµi ùëÇùëñ‚àí1 , 0)
Therefore, the patient on day i + 1 can be recursively calculated using the following formula:
Ei+1 = ùê∏ùëñ + ‚àÜi
The model simulation results after calculating the parameters using the data before 24:00 on
January 27 are shown in Figure 7:

Model 6 comprehensive prediction model
The prediction results of the aforementioned five models are similar. In order to obtain the
overall situation consideration, the minimum value of the above model is used to obtain the
optimistic forecast data, and the maximum value is used to obtain the pessimistic forecast
data to comprehensively judge the trend of the epidemic situation. The predictions of this
model are shown in the results section.

Conclusion
This article shows some basic mathematical models established by numerical rules. Among
them, the model 5 based on the number of medical observations predicts that the peak
number of confirmed patients will appear between 24:00 on February 2 and 24:00 on February
5. This may help to determine the trend of the epidemic.
