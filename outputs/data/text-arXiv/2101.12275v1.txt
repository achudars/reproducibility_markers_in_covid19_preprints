It is well recognized that population heterogeneity plays an important role in the spread of
epidemics. While individual variations in social activity are often assumed to be persistent, i.e.
constant in time, here we discuss the consequences of dynamic heterogeneity. We integrate the
stochastic dynamics of social activity into traditional epidemiological models. The overall epidemic
dynamics is condensed to three differential equations and is characterized by an emergent long
timescale. Our model captures multiple features of real-life epidemics such as COVID-19, including
prolonged plateaus and multiple waves. Individual waves are suppressed at the state of Transient
Collective Immunity (TCI), which subsequently degrades due to the dynamic nature of social activity.
Our results also provide a new mechanism for emerging pathogens to transition from a fast-paced
epidemic to the endemic state.

COVID-19 pandemics has underscored the prominent
role played by population heterogeneity in epidemics. On
one hand, the observed transmission of infection is characterized by the phenomenon of super-spreading, in which
a small fraction of individuals are responsible for a disproportionally large number of secondary infections [1–6]. On
the other hand, according to multiple models, population
heterogeneity is expected to suppress the herd immunity
threshold (HIT) and reduce the final size of an epidemic
[7–18]. In the context of COVID-19, this observation
led to a controversial suggestion that a strategy relying
exclusively on quickly reaching the herd immunity might
be a viable alternative to government-imposed mitigation
[19]. However, the experience of locations that had embraced that strategy has exposed its flaws. While the first
wave of infections in those locations never reached the
scale of an unmitigated epidemic predicted by classical
homogeneous models, it also failed to provide long-lasting
protection against new waves.
Another puzzling phenomenon observed in the course of
the COVID-19 pandemic is plateau-like dynamics, when
the incidence rate stays at an approximately constant
level for a prolonged time [20–22]. These dramatic departures from predictions of both classical epidemiological
models and their heterogeneous extensions have led to
a greater appreciation of the role played by human behavior in epidemic dynamics. In particular, one plausible
mechanism that might be responsible for both suppression of the early waves and plateau-like dynamics is that
individuals modify their behavior based on information
about the current epidemiological situation [22–24]. It
was also suggested that long plateaus might arise because
of the underlying structure of social networks [21].
Here we study epidemic dynamics accounting for random changes in levels of individual social activity. We
demonstrate that this type of dynamic heterogeneity, even
without knowledge-based adaptation of human behavior
(e.g. in response to epidemic-related news), leads to a

substantial revision of the epidemic progression, consistent with the empirical data for the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a recent study [15] we have pointed out that population heterogeneity is a dynamic property that roams
across multiple timescales. A strong short-term overdispersion of the individual infectivity manifests itself in the
statistics of super-spreading events. At the other end of
the spectrum is a much weaker persistent heterogeneity
operating on very long timescales. In particular, it is
this long-term heterogeneity that leads to a reduction of
the HIT compared to that predicted by classical homogeneous models [14–18]. However, the epidemic dynamics
is also sensitive to transient timescales over which the
bursty short-term social activity of each individual crosses
over to its long-term average. By including the effects of
dynamic heterogeneity, we demonstrate that a suppression of the early waves of the COVID-19 epidemic, even
without active mitigation, does not signal achievement of
long-term herd immunity. Instead, it is associated with
the state of Transient Collective Immunity (TCI), which is
fragile and degrades over time as individuals change their
social activity patterns [15]. As we demonstrate below,
the first wave is generally followed either by secondary
waves or by long plateaus characterized by a nearly constant incidence rate. In the context of COVID-19 both
long plateaus and multi-wave epidemic dynamics have
been commonly observed [20]. According to our analysis,
the number of daily infections during the plateau regime,
as well as the individual wave trajectories, are robust
properties of the epidemic and depend on the current
level of mitigation, degree of heterogeneity and temporal
correlations of individual social activity.
According to our results, once the plateau-like dynamics is established, the epidemic gradually evolves towards
the long-term HIT determined by the persistent population heterogeneity. However, reaching that state may
stretch over a very long time, from months to years. On
these long timescales, both waning of individual biological

2
immunity and mutations of the pathogen become valid
concerns, and would ultimately result in a permanent
endemic state of the infection. Such endemic behavior
is a well-known property of most classical epidemiological models [25]. However, the emergence of the endemic
state for a newly introduced pathogen is far from being
completely understood [26–28]. Indeed, most epidemiological models would typically predict complete extinction
of a pathogen following the first wave of the epidemic,
well before the pool of susceptible population would be
replenished. A commonly accepted, though mostly qualitative, explanation for the onset of endemic behavior
of such diseases as measles, seasonal cold, etc., involves
geographic heterogeneity: the pathogen may survive in
other geographic locations until returning to a hard hit
area with a depleted susceptible pool [26, 27]. In contrast,
our theory provides a simple and general mechanism that
prevents an overshoot of the epidemic dynamics and thus
naturally leads to the endemic fixed point.
The importance of temporal effects has been long recognized in the context of network-based epidemiological
models [29–33]. On one hand, available high-resolution
data on real-world temporal contact networks allows direct modeling of epidemic spread on those networks. On
the other hand, building upon successes of epidemic models on static unweighted networks [1, 4, 7–9, 34–37], a
variety of their temporal generalizations have been proposed. Those typically involve particular rules for discrete
or continuous network rewiring [30–33, 38, 39] such as e.g.
in activity-based network models [24, 40–42]. While important theoretical results have been obtained for some of
these problems, especially regarding the epidemic threshold, many open questions and challenges remain in the
field [33, 43]. In this paper, we start with a more traditional heterogeneous well-mixed model, which is essentially equivalent to the mean-field description of an
epidemic on a network [9, 10, 44], and include effects
of time-variable social activity that modulates levels of
individual susceptibilities and infectivities.
The basic idea behind our model is represented in Fig.
1. Each individual i is characterized by time-dependent
social activity ai (t) proportional to his/her current frequency and intensity of close social contacts. This quantity determines both individual susceptibility to infection
as well as ability to infect others. In our model we combine a simple mathematical description of social dynamics
with the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR)
epidemiological model. Qualitatively it leads to long-term
epidemic dynamics fuelled by replenishment of susceptible
population due to changes in the level of individual social
activity from low to high. Fig. 1(a) illustrates this process
by showing people with low social activity (depicted as
socially isolated at home) occasionally increasing their
level of activity (depicted as a party). Fig. 1(b) represents
the same dynamics in terms of individual functions ai (t).
Note that each person is characterized by his/her own
long-term average activity level αi (dot-dashed lines), but
the transmission occurs predominantly between individ-

individual is characterized by a time-dependent social activity.
a) People with low social activity (depicted as socially isolated
figures at home) occasionally increase their level of activity
(depicted as a party). The average activity in the population
remains the same, but individuals constantly change their
activity levels from low to high (arrows pointing up) and back
(arrows pointing down). Individuals are colored according to
their state in the SIR epidemiological model: susceptible green, infected - red, and removed - blue. The epidemic is
fuelled by constant replenishment of susceptible population
with high activity due to transitions from the low activity state.

uals with high levels of current social activity. This is
because ai (t) determines both current susceptibility and
individual infectivity of a person. However, the secondary
transmission is delayed with respect to the moment of
infection, by a time of the order of a single generation
interval τg (around 5 days for COVID-19). Studies of realworld contact and interpersonal communication networks
have shown that individual social activity is bursty and
varies across multiple timescales—from seconds to years
[45–48].
For any individual i the value of ai (t) has a tendency
to gradually drift towards its persistent average level αi ,
which itself varies within the population. In our model,
we assign a single timescale τs to this mean reversion
process. This is of course a simplification of the multi-

3
scale relaxation observed in real social dynamics. While
τs can be treated as a fitting parameter of our model, here
we simply set it to be τs = 30 days, several fold longer
than the mean generation interval of COVID-19, τg = 5
days. Note that from the point of view of the epidemic
dynamics, variations in activity on timescales shorter
than mean generation interval may be safely ignored.
For example, attending a single party would increase
individual’s risk of infection but would not change his/her
likelihood of transmission to others 5 days later.
The individual social activity ai (t) is governed by the
following stochastic equation:
a˙i (t) =

αi − ai (t)
+ ηi (t)
τs

(1)

Here η(t) is a short-time noise that gives rise to timedependent variations in ai (t). We set hηi (t)ηi (t0 )i =
2ai (t)
0
τs k0 δ(t − t ), which results in a diffusion in the space
of individual social activity with diffusion coefficient proportional to ai . This stochastic process is well known in
mathematical finance as Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) model
[49] and has been studied in probability theory since 1950s
[50]. The major properties of this model are (i) reversion
to the mean and (ii) non-negativity of ai at all times,
both of which are natural for social activity. Furthermore,
the steady state solution of this model is characterized
by the Gamma-distributed ai . This is consistent with
the empirical statistics of short-term overdispersion of
disease transmission manifesting itself in superspreading
events [1, 6, 51]. More specifically, for a given level of persistent activity α, this model generates the steady-state
distribution of “instantaneous” values of social activity a
following gamma distribution with mean α and variance
α/k0 : fα (a) ∼ ak0 α−1 e−k0 a .
The statistics of super-spreader events is usually fitted with a negative binomial distribution. The latter
is in turn derived from a gamma-distributed individual
reproduction number [1, 6, 51]. This can be used for
partial calibration of our model. We assume persistent
levels of social activity αi to also follow a Gamma distribution with dispersion parameter κ. In several recent
studies of epidemic dynamics in populations with persistent heterogeneity [15, 17, 52] it has been demonstrated
that dispersion parameter κ determines the herd immunity threshold. Multiple studies [10, 48, 53] of real-world
contact networks report approximately exponential distribution of α, which corresponds to κ ' 1. Throughout this
paper, we assume a more conservative value, κ = 2, i.e.
coefficient of variation 1/κ = 0.5. For consistency with
the reported value of short-term overdispersion parameter
[51], 1/k ≈ 1/κ+1/k0 ≈ 3, we set k0 = 0.4. Note however
that the dispersion of individual reproductive number has
a wide uncertainty, and could be further enhanced by a
variation of individual contagiousness.
According to Eq. (1), individuals, each characterized by
his/her own persistent level of social activity α, effectively
diffuse in the space of their current social activity a. This
leads to major modifications of the epidemic dynamics.

FIG. 2. Schematic representation of the mechanisms that lead
to self-limited epidemic dynamics. In traditional epidemic
models, the major factor is the depletion of susceptible population. Government-imposed mitigation and/or behavioral
adaptation to the perceived risk create another feedback loop
(purple). Yet another mechanism, is due to the dynamic heterogeneity of the attack rate parameterized by h(t) (black).
On the one hand, the attack rate heterogeneity is being generated by the current infection. On the other hand, it suppresses
itself on the timescale of τs due the reversion of individual
social activity towards the mean (black feedback loop).

For instance, the equation for the susceptible fraction in
classical epidemic models [25] acquires the following form:


a ∂2
α−a ∂
Ṡα (a, t) = −aJ(t) +
+
Sα (a, t)
k0 τs ∂a2
τs ∂a
(2)
Here Sα (a, t) is the fraction of susceptible individuals
within a subpopulation with a given value of persistent
social activity α and with current social activity a, at
the moment of infection, J(t) is the current strength of
infection. Its time evolution can be described by any
traditional epidemiological model, such as e.g. age-ofinfection, SIR/SEIR, etc [25].
Eq. (2), is dramatically simplified by the following
Anzats: Sα (a, t) = e−Z(t)α−k0 h(t)a . Here Z(t) is a measure of persistent heterogeneity of the attack rate: the
larger it is, the larger is the difference in depletion of
susceptibles among subpopulations with different α’s, i.e.
various levels of persistent social activity. On the other
hand, h(t) parametrizes the transient heterogeneity within
each of these subpopulations. Both Z(t) and h(t) indicate the current level of heterogeneity of the attack rate
i.e. susceptible population structure. In the long run,
transient heterogeneity disappears due to the diffusion
in the a-space, thus h(t) asymptotically approaches 0 as
t → ∞. We combine this Anzats with with a general
methodology developed in our recent work [15] that provides a quasi-homogeneous description to a wide variety
of heterogeneous epidemiological models. For a specific
case of the SIR dynamics, we assign each person a state
variable Ii set to 1 when the individual is infectious and
0 otherwise. Now, the activity-weighted fraction of the
infected population is defined as I(t) = hIi ai (t)i/ha2i i,

As in the case of persistent heterogeneity without temporal variations [15], the long term herd immunity threshold,
1 − (R0 M )−1/λ , is determined by the immunity factor λ.
The latter depends both on the short-term and persistent
dispersion parameters:


1 + κ−1 1 + kg−1 + 2κ−1
(6)
λ=
1 + kg−1 + κ−1
Here kg = k0 (1 + τg /τs ) is the dispersion parameter for activity a(t) averaged over a timescale of a single generation
interval. For parameters k0 = 0.4 and κ = 2, τs = 30 days
used throughout our study, kg = 0.47, λ = 1.7, consistent
with our earlier estimate of λ∞ ≈ 2 [15]. As we argued
in Ref. [15] a single epidemic wave can be described by
a considerably larger immunity factor λef f ≈ 4 − 5 giving rise to the TCI state. This study supersedes that
approximation by introducing the dynamic attack rate
heterogeneity h(t).
In Figure 2 we schematically represent three feedback
mechanisms that lead to self-limited epidemic dynamics. The most conventional of them relies on depletion of
susceptible population (red). Another mechanism is due
to government mitigation as well as personal behavioral
response to perceived epidemic risk (purple). Finally,
according to our theory there is yet another generic mechanism related to accumulated heterogeneity of the attack
rate, quantified by parameter h(t). Due to the long-term
relaxation of h(t) this feedback loop limits the scale of
a single epidemic wave, but does not provide long-term
protection against new ones.
As demonstrated below, the theory described by Eqs.
(3)-(5) is in excellent agreement with simulations of the
Agent-Based Model (ABM) in which social activities of 1
million agents undergo stochastic evolution described by

and the current infection strength is proportional to it:
J(t) = R0 M (t)I(t)/τg . Here M (t) is a time-dependent
mitigation factor, which combines the effects of government interventions, societal response to the epidemic,
as well other sources of time modulation, such as e.g.
seasonal forcing.
The epidemic in a population with both persistent and
dynamic heterogeneity of individual social activity can
be compactly described as a dynamical system with only
three variables: the susceptible population fraction S(t),
the infected population fraction I(t) (activity-weighted)
which is proportional to strength of infection J(t), and the
transient heterogeneity parameter h(t). In the (S, I, h)space, the dynamics is given by the following set of differential equations:

FIG. 3. (a)-(c) Comparison of the epidemic dynamics with
homogeneous population (black curves), persistent population
heterogeneity (brown curves), and with dynamic heterogeneity
(green curves): mitigation profile (a), daily incidence (b), and
cumulative attack rate (c). While parameters in cases (b) and
(c) correspond to the same herd immunity threshold (HIT),
the behavior is drastically different. In the persistent model,
the epidemic quickly overshoots above HIT level. In the case
of dynamic heterogeneity, the initial wave is followed by a
plateau-like behavior with slow relaxation towards the HIT.
Note an excellent agreement between the quasi-homogeneous
theory described by Eqs. (3- 5) (solid lines) and the AgentBased Model with 1 million agents whose stochastic activity
is given by Eq. (1) (shaded area = the range of 3 independent
simulations).

by Eq. (1) (compare solid lines with shaded areas in Figs.
3, 4).
Figure 3 illustrates a dramatic effect time-dependent
heterogeneity has on the epidemic dynamics. It compares
three cases: the classical homogeneous SIR model (black),
the same model with persistent heterogeneity (brown),
and the dynamic heterogeneity case considered in this
study (green). The latter two models share the same
HIT (green dashed line) which is reduced compared to
the homogeneous case (black dashed line). In the absence of dynamic heterogeneity (black and brown) the
initial exponential growth halts once the respective HIT
is reached, but the the overall attack rate “overshoots”
beyond that point, eventually reaching a significantly
larger level, known as the final size of the epidemic (FSE).
Importantly, in both these cases the epidemic has only
a single wave of duration set by the mean generation
interval τg multiplied by a certain R0 -dependent factor.

FIG. 4. The time course of an epidemic with enhanced mitigation during the first wave. (a) shows the M (t)R0 progression
for two different strategies. In both cases, the enhanced mitigation leads to a 50% reduction of M (t)R0 from 2 to 1. In
the first scenario (early mitigation, blue curves), the reduction
lasted for only 15 days starting from day 27. In the second
scenario (delayed mitigation, red curves), the mitigation was
applied on day 37 and lasted for 45 days. (b)-(c) show daily
incidence and cumulative attack rates for both strategies. As
predicted, differences in the initial mitigation had no significant effect on the epidemic in the long run: the two trajectories
eventually converge towards the universal attractor. However,
the early mitigation allows to suppress the peak of the infection, potentially reducing the stress on healthcare system. A
delayed mitigation gives rose to a sizable second wave.

In the case of dynamic heterogeneity (green), described
by Eqs. (3)-(5), the epidemic is transiently suppressed at
the level which is below even the heterogeneous HIT. As
mentioned above, we associate this temporary suppression
with the population reaching the TCI state. On longer
timescales, this state is destroyed due to changing levels
of individual social activity, and the epidemic continues,
with cumulative attack rate gradually approaching the
heterogeneous HIT (green dashed line).
According to Eqs. (3-5) for a fixed mitigation level
M (t), any epidemic trajectory would eventually converge
to the same curve, i.e. the universal attractor. It manifests
itself as an extended plateau on the green curve in Fig.
3b, which slowly relaxes towards the HIT. This relaxation
is characterized by an emergent long time constant τ̃ '
τs /k0 > τs . The existence of the universal attractor is
apparent in Fig 4, where we compare two scenarios with
different mitigation strategies applied at early stages of

the epidemic. In both cases, an enhanced mitigation
was imposed leading to a reduction of M (t)R0 by 50%
from 2 to 1. In the first scenario (blue curves), the
enhanced mitigation was imposed on day 27 and lasted
for 15 days. In the second scenario (red curves), the
mitigation was applied on day 37 and lasted for 45 days.
As predicted, this difference in mitigation has not had
any significant effect on the epidemic in the long run:
these two trajectories eventually converged towards the
universal attractor. However, short- and medium- term
effects were substantial. The early mitigation scenario
(blue curve) resulted in a substantial suppression of the
maximum incidence during the first wave. Immediately
following the release of the mitigation the second wave
started and reached approximately the same peak value
as the first one. If the objective of the intervention is to
avoid the overflow of the healthcare system, this strategy
would indeed help to achieve it. In contrast, the delayed
mitigation scenario (red curve) turned out to be largely
counterproductive. It did not suppress the peak of the
first wave, but brought the infection to a very low level
after it. Eventually, that suppression backfired as the
TCI state get deteriorated and the epidemic came back
as the second wave, though not as strong as the first one.
Since the late-stage evolution in our model is characterized by a long relaxation time τ̃ , the possibility of waning
of individual biological immunity or escape mutations
of the pathogen accumulated over certain (presumably,
also long) time τb , becomes a relevant effect. It can be
incorporated as an additional relaxation term (1 − S)/τb
in Eq. (4). The analysis of our equations, modified in this
way, shows that the universal attractor leads to a fixed
point corresponding to the endemic state. That point is
located somewhat below the HIT and characterized by
the finite residual incidence rate (1 − S∞ )/τb and, respectively, by finite values of I and h. Here S∞ is a susceptible
population fraction in the endemic state, which is close
but somewhat higher than that at the onset of the herd
immunity. A similar endemic steady state exists in most
classical epidemic models (See [25] and references therein).
However, in those cases, the epidemic dynamics would
not normally lead to that point due to the overshoot
phenomenon. Instead, those models typically predict a
complete extinction of the disease when the prevalence
drops below one infected individual. This may happen
before the herd immunity is lost due to waning biological immunity and/or replenishment of the susceptible
population (e.g. due to births of immunologically naive individuals). That is not the case when the time-dependent
heterogeneity is included.
Note that for most pathogens the endemic point is not
fixed but instead is subjected to periodic seasonal forcing
in M (t). This leads to annual peaks and troughs in the
incidence rate. Our model is well posed to describe this
seasonal dynamics as well as transition towards it for a
new pathogen (see Fig. 5). It captures the important
qualitative features of seasonal waves of real pathogens,
e.g. three endemic coronavirus families studied in Ref.

6
[54]. They are (i) sharp peaks followed by a prolonged
relaxation towards the annual minimum; (ii) a possibility
of multi-annual cycles due to parametric resonance.

heterogeneity leads to an endemic state with strong seasonal
oscillations (green line). Insert: The epidemic dynamics in
the (J, h) phase space. The black dotted line corresponds to
the universal attractor trajectory manifested e.g. as a plateau
in green line in Fig. 3b. The attractor leads to the endemic
state (red point).

To understand the nature of the overall epidemic dynamics, we focus on the behavior of variables J(t) and
h(t). Their evolution is described by Eqs.(3) and (5),
with R∗ = R0 M (t)S(t)λ playing the role of a driving
force. As a result of depletion of susceptible population,
the driving force is gradually reduced, and the dynamic
converges towards a slow evolution along the universal
attractor shown as a black dotted trajectory in (h, J)
coordinates at the insert to Fig. 5. For initial conditions
away from that trajectory (say, J ≈ 0, h = 0), the linear
stability analysis indicates that the epidemic dynamics
has a damped oscillatory behavior manifesting itself as
a spiral-like relaxation towards the universal attractor.
A combination of this spiral dynamics with a slow drift
towards the endemic state gives rise to the overall trajectory shown as the solid green line at the insert to Fig.
5. The periodic seasonal forcing generates a limit cycle
about the endemic point (small green ellipse around the
red point).
More generally, any abrupt increase of the effective
reproduction number e.g. due to a relaxed mitigation,
seasonal changes, etc. would shift the endemic fixed point
up along the universal attractor. According to Eqs. (3-5)
this will once again trigger a spiral-like relaxation. It will
manifest itself as a new wave of the epidemic, such as the

of M (t)R0 curves were subject to variation: the mitigation
level M (t) before and after the termination of the lockdown,
the amplitude of the seasonal forcing, and the summer-winter
crossover time. Other parameters have been fixed: k0 = 0.4,

A systematic calibration of our model and application
to real-world epidemiological data is beyond the scope of
this study. However, below we present a proof-of-principle
demonstration that the progression in COVID-19 epidemic in the summer and fall of 2020 in four regions of
the continental US: South, Northeast, Midwest and West

to be 0.4%. Unlike during the first wave, state-mandated
mitigation measures have been relaxed in the early summer and kept largely constant during this time. Thus it
is reasonable to assume M (t) to follow regular seasonal
dynamics during that time period. This is reflected in a
simple mitigation profile R0 M (t) shown in Fig. 6a featuring a sharp relaxation of mitigation in early summer
2020 and gradual seasonal increase of the reproduction
number during the fall. Release of mitigation triggered
an immediate second wave in South and West (Fig. 6c)
that had relatively low exposure during the first wave
of the epidemic. In our model the wave is transiently
suppressed when these regions reach the TCI state. Differences between the data and our model observed in the
early fall may be tentatively attributed to governmentimposed mitigation measures and/or to knowledge-based
adaptation of the human behavior [22–24]. The late fall
wave in all regions was triggered by seasonal changes in
transmission. According to our model this wave was stabilized in mid-winter due to the population once again
reaching the TCI state. Note a good agreement between
peak levels of this wave with our predictions.
Midwest and Northeast (Fig. 6b) exhibited similar
behavior except having a plateau instead of the summer
wave due to their higher levels of exposure during the
first wave of the epidemic in spring 2020. Importantly,
the transmission monotonically increases throughout the
entire time window, yet our model captures the observed
secondary waves and plateaus. That behavior would be
impossible to explain using traditional epidemiological
models well below the herd immunity.
In conclusion, here we proposed a new theory integrating the stochastic dynamics of individual social activity
into traditional epidemiological models. Our model describes the so-called “zero intelligence” limit in which
there is no feedback from the epidemic dynamics to social
activity e.g. mediated by the news. Hence our approach
is complementary to knowledge-based models of Refs. [22–

24]. The stochastic social activity in our approach is described by the CIR model [49] which captures its following
important properties: (i) the activity cannot be negative;
(ii) for any given individual it reverses towards its longterm average value; (iii) it exhibits gamma-distributed
short-term overdispersion (aka superspreading) [1, 6, 51].
We mapped the overall epidemic dynamics featuring heterogeneous time-varying social activity onto a system of
three differential equations, two of which generalize the
traditional SIR model. The third equation describes the
dynamics of the heterogeneity parameter h(t), driven up
by the current strength of infection J(t) and relaxing back
to zero due to variable social activity.
The emergent property of our theory is the new long
timescale τs /k0 governing the relaxation towards either
the herd immunity or the endemic state of the pathogen.
This behavior is in striking contrast to traditional epidemiological models generally characterized by a large
overshoot beyond the herd immunity threshold leading
to a likely extinction of new pathogens. Our theory is in
a good agreement with the empirical observation of long
plateaus observed for many real-life epidemics including
COVID-19 [20]. Dynamic heterogeneity also leads to a
transient suppression of individual waves of the epidemic
without reaching the long-term herd immunity [15]. Finally, we demonstrated that our theory is in quantitative
agreement with the data describing secondary waves of
COVID-19 epidemic in different regions of the USA.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS
A.

Epidemic dynamics with dynamic heterogeneity

Let ai (t) be a measure of individual’s social activity proportional to frequency and intensity of close contacts with
other people around time t. We refer to it as (social) susceptibility to infection, but it also determines one’s potential
to infect others. In particular, infectivity of a person i infected at time t∗i is given by
βi (t∗i + τ ) = Ci (τ )ai (t∗ + τ )

(S1)

Here Ci (τ ) is person’s contagiousness level, at time τ after infection.
Let j(t) be the fraction of infected individual, weighted proportionally to their current infectivity level, and M (t)
be mitigation factor that reflects government and social response to epidemics, seasonal effects etc. Their product,
J(t) = M (t)j(t) is force of infection, i.e. a hypothetical incidence rate in fully susceptible homogeneous population
with α = 1. Within the heterogeneous (but well-mixed) age-of-infection model, current value of j(t) is given by
Z ∞
j(t) = hβi (t − t∗i )ii =
hCi (τ )ai (t)ai (t − τ )Si (t − τ )ii J(t − τ )dτ
(S2)
0

Here Si (t − τ ) is the state of an individual i (1 if susceptible, 0 otherwise). Since J(t) is by definition proportional to
j(t), we obtain quasi-homogeneous renewal equation:
Z ∞
j(t) =
K(t, τ )Re (t − τ )j(t − τ )dτ

Here effective reproduction number Re and pdf of generation interval K(τ ), are given by

Stochastic model for social activity

It is well known that social interactions are ”bursty”. That is to say, individual social activity has both (nearly)
permanent and significant time-dependent contributions:
ai (t) = αi + δai (t)

(S6)

Without loss of generality we set the population-averaged permanent and instantaneous susceptibility to 1: hai (t)ii =
hαi ii = 1 Beyond its average value, the overall statistics of instantaneous α(t) is properly defined only if that quantity
is average over specified time window δt. Naturally, its variation will gradually decrease as the time widow increases.
Individual reproductive number, Ri , for COVID-19 epidemic is (in)famously over-dispersed. This is manifested in
so-called super-spreading phenomenon, when a majority of secondary infections are caused by small fraction of index
cases. The overdispersion reflects (i) variation of peak contagiousness level among individuals and (ii) dispersion of
ai (t) which is effectively averaged over a timescale of the peak infection period (approximately 2 days).
Importantly, according to Eq.(S4), reproductive number depends on correlations of ai across a time scale of a single
generation interval (on average, 4 to 5 days for COVID 19). Thus, any variations in ai (t) that do not persist over
that timescale would be averaged out. Here we introduce a simple model to account for temporal variation of social
activity. In this model, ai may vary on short time scale, relax to the persistent value for a given individual over certain
relaxation time, τs :
a˙i =

αi − ai
+ ηi (t)
τs

(S7)

i (t)
0
Here η(t) is short-time noise that gives rise to time dependent fluctuations. We set hηi (t)ηi (t0 )i = 2a
τs k0 δ(t − t ), which
gives rise to individual diffusion in ai space with diffusion coefficient proportional to ai . The evolution of population
with a given value of persistent activity α in that space is given by the following Fokker-Plank Equation:

Ψ̇α (a, t) =

1 ∂ 2 (aΨ(a, t))
1 ∂ ((a − α)Ψα (a, t))
+
2
k0 τs
∂a
τs
∂a

(S8)

2
The steady state solution to this equation gives a probability density function (pdf) for a, which turns out to be a
commonly used gamma distribution:
Ψα (a, t) = fα (a) =

aαk0 −1 e−k0 a
ααk0 Γ(αk0 )

(S9)

Note that statistics of superspreading events is commonly modeled assuming the very same distribution for individual
reproduction number, Ri . This gives a strong empirical support to the chosen model, in particular to the choice of
diffusion coefficient to be proportional to α. It also allows us to partially calibrate the model. Reported dispersion
parameter associated with superspreading events for COVID 19 is in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 [6, 51]. Note however
that our parameter k0 is expected to be larger than k, i.e. has a smaller dispersion. This is because variations of a(t)
over the timescale shorter than a single generation interval would be averaged out according to Eq. (S10), while the
superspreading statistics effectively probes it over a shorter time interval of the infectivity peak in a single individual.
The latter could be further enhanced by a variation of individual contagiousness e.g. due to biological factors.
It is well known that the mean reproduction number R0 in a heterogeneous population depends on the second
moment of distribution of α (in network epidemic models it is related to individual degree). However, there is an
important modification to that result for time-dependent a(t):

R

Here R = h Ci (τ )dτ ii is the net infection transmission probability of an average person. This gives:
R0 = hαi2 i + µk0−1
Here factor µ is related to the Laplace transform of average contagiousness profile, K0 (τ ) = hCi (τ )ii /R.

Specifically, for the case of SIR model, i.e. K0 (τ ) ∼ e−τ /τ0 , one obtains: µ = 1/(1 + τ0 /τs ) ≈ 1/(1 + τg /τs ). Here mean
generation interval τg is given by

In this SIR case, one can assign each person a state variable Ii set to 1 when the individual is infectious and 0 otherwise.
This allows to describe the epidemic dynamics in terms of activity-weighted fraction of the infected population,
I(t) = hIi ai (t)i/ha2i i. Note that variable j(t) and hence the strength of infection are proportional to it:
J(t) = M (t)j(t) =

Mapping on quasi-homogeneous dynamic system

Let Sα (a, t) be the fraction of susceptibles among the sub-population with persistent activity level α and given value
of a, at time t. Change of function Sα (a, t) is driven by two effects: (i) depletion of susceptible population due to
infection and (ii) diffusion of individual in α space. By substituting Φα (a, t) = fα (a)Sα (t) into Fokker-Plank Eq. (S8),
and adding infection term with rate −a(t), we obtain evolution equation for Sα ;

This equation can be solved by using the following Anzats:
Sα (a, t) = exp [−Z(t)α − k0 h(t)a]

(S17)

Here Z(t) is a measure of persistent heterogeneity: the larger it is, the more is the difference in depletion of
susceptible among subpopulations with different α’s, i.e. various average levels of social activity. On the other hand,
h(t) parameterizes the transient heterogeneity within each of these subpopulations. In the long run, this type of
heterogeneity disappears due to evolution in a-space, thus h(t) asymptotically approaches 0 as t → ∞. Substituting
Eq. (S17) into Eq. (S16) results in simple equations for both Z(t) and h(t):

Renewal equation Eq(S3) for j(t) completes our quasi-homogeneous description of the epidemic dynamics. However,
to fully close this system of equations, one needs to express effective reproduction number, Re , in terms of by functions
M (t), Z(t) and h(t). This is done by substituting Anzats, Eq. (S17), into Eq. (S4). We perform this calculation
in two steps, by first finding effective number Rα for a sub-population with average level of activity α, followed by
averaging over persistent heterogeneity. This gives

Note that for most practical purpose, one can set qχ (S, h) = 1. Parameter λ is ”immunity factor” that emerged
in the context of our earlier study of persistent heterogeneity [15]. In that case, λ = 1 + 2/κ appears as a scaling
exponent in relationship between effective reproduction number Re (t) and the fraction of the susceptible population
S(t): Re = R0 M S λ . Eq. (S26) generalizes that result.
Eqs.(S3), (S18), S26, (S22) and give the full description of the epidemic dynamics in heterogeneous system. For a
particular case of SIR model (K(τ ) ∼ e−τ /τg ), we it is reduced to a 3D dynamical system, e.g. in terms of variables

Waves and plateaus

According to Eq. (S29), the combined driving force of the epidemic is R∗ = R0 M (t)S λ (t). It includes both effects
of mitigation M (t) and suppression associated with the build up of the long-term herd immunity. First, we assume R∗
to be fixed or change very slowly (adiabatically), i.e. on the timescales longer than τs . In that case, J(t) and h(t) trail
the driving force R∗ (t), staying close to the corresponding adiabatic fixed point (J ∗ , h∗ ) in their 2D phase space:

Stability of this adiabatic fixed point, and the more rapid epidemic dynamics can be described by linearizing Eqs.
(S29, S31) and (S18) around (J ∗ , h∗ ), i.e. by assuming h(t) = h∗ + δh(t) and J(t) = J ∗ + δJ(t):

Amplitude of the oscillations decays with the time constant 2τs /(1 + 2h∗ ). This oscillatory behavior would manifest
itself as multiple epidemic waves. In reality, the dynamics is more complicated since rapid changes of M (t), e.g. due to
seasonal effects, government and societal response to the epidemic, would additionally modulate it.
Assumption of R∗ = R0 M (t)S λ (t) being fixed is not, of course, realistic. In particular, mitigation factor M (t) may
have both slow fast variations. On top of that, the dependence of R∗ on S(t) creates a negative feedback suppressing
the forcing on the long run. For a constant mitigation M , there is a line of fixed points (J, S, h) = (0, S, 0), for any

. Here 1 − S0 represents the long-term herd immunity threshold (HIT) for a given mitigation
S ≤ S0 = (R0 M )
˜ S̃(t), h̃(t)) corresponding to all three variables slowly evolving in such
level M . There is one particular solution (J(t),
a way that Re stays close to 1 at all times, eventually reaching the HIT point, (0, S0 ). As follows from the above
stability analysis, this solution acts as an attractor, with any trajectory in (J, S, h) space converging towards it, unless
perturbed by variations in mitigation M (t). To construct that solution, we sate rate in Eq.(S29) to 0 and use Eqs
(S30)-(S31) to calculate the corresponding evolution of h(t):

describes the rate at which the recovered population (fraction 1 − S) reverts back to the susceptible state. The endemic
steady state can be found by setting time derivatives Eqs. (S29),(S31) and (S43), to 0. Under assumption that

Seasonal forcing

Seasonal effects are commonly described as simple sin-shaped modulation of reproductive number [54]. In this work,
we used a combination of sigmoidal functions to model transition between ”winter” and ”summer” values of M (t):

and 0.35 in our fits of epidemic dynamics for different US regions, Fig. 6.

Implementation of the agent-based model

All simulations for the agent-based model use 1 million agents and 3 simulation replicates. For each agent in the
simulation, at each time step, the social activity follows the stochastic dynamics described in Eq. 1. After that, the
overall force of infection is computed using
J(t) =

R0 M (t) 1 X
ai Ii
τg ha(t)2 ii N i

,

(S48)

where Ii is binary and used to denote whether or not the agent is infectious, N is the number of agents in the simulation.
For a susceptible agent i, the chance of being infected in one simulation step is ai (t)J(t)dt which is proportional to
the force of infection, his/her activity ai (t), and dt - the length of the time step used in our simulations. For an
infectious agent, the probability of recovering from the infectious state in one simulation step is γdt. When the waning
of biological immunity is ignored, recovered agents will always stay in the recovered state and cannot be infected again.
