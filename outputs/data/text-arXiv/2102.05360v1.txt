Abstract
The massive shock of the COVID-19 pandemic is already showing its negative effects on
economies around the world, unprecedented in recent history. COVID-19 infections and
containment measures have caused a general slowdown in research and new knowledge
production. Because of the link between R&D spending and economic growth, it is to be
expected then that a slowdown in research activities will slow in turn the global recovery from
the pandemic. Many recent studies also claim an uneven impact on scientific production across
gender. In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon across countries, analysing preprint
depositions. Differently from other works, that compare the number of preprint depositions
before and after the pandemic outbreak, we analyse the depositions trends across geographical
areas, and contrast after-pandemic depositions with expected ones. Differently from common
belief and initial evidence, in few countries female scientists increased their scientific output
while males plunged.

Introduction
Following the COVID-19 outbreak in China and the Far East first, Italy and Europe shortly
after, and finally the Americas, governments adopted a body of emergency measures to contrast
the pandemic diffusion. Among others, mobility restrictions and social distancing caused
simultaneous disruptions to both supply and demand in a globalized world economy. On the
supply side, reduction of labour supply because of infections, business closures and slowdown
of production because of lockdowns and social distancing, caused a decrease in production. On
the demand side, notwithstanding social safety nets introduced by governments, layoffs, loss of
income, and worsened economic prospects caused a reduction in household consumption and
private investment.
A rapidly growing number of studies investigate the macroeconomic effects of COVID-19
pandemic across countries, sectors in individual countries, as well as on a global scale (Pagano
et al., 2020; Ludvigson et al., 2020; Baqaee & Farhi, 2020; McKibbin & Fernando, 2020).
According to the World Bank, the massive shock of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown
measures to contain it have plunged the global economy into the worst economic depression
since World War II.1 The negative effect on economies around the world is expected to lead to
a decline in per capita income in about 90% of countries in 2020 (Djankov & Panizza, 2020),
not to even mention the long-term social effects.
Due to containment measures, research activities, both public and private, have undergone
a general slowdown as well, especially in those disciplines where the presence at work and
close interaction with colleagues are necessary. “Levels of self-perceived productivity dropped,
where dry lab scientists were much more likely to continue carrying out their work from home
as expected (29% of dry lab scientists, but only 10% of wet lab scientists, reported “at least
80% productivity”)” (Korbel & Stegle, 2020). At many major research universities, nonessential research was halted, “in what amounts to an unprecedented stoppage of academic
science in modern memory” (Redden, 2020).
It is widely accepted in economic theory that R&D spending can lead to rates of return well
above those expected on standard capital investment (Deleidi et al., 2019). It is to be expected
then that a slowdown in research output will slow in turn global recovery from COVID-19.
In this work, we undertake empirical analysis of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on
worldwide research production, across macro-geographical areas and distinguishing by gender.
We expect that the extent of slowdown in research activities varies across countries and over
time, depending on the spread of infections, the extent of social restrictions, and timing of both.
Furthermore, the adoption of smart working, especially at universities and public research
institutions, alongside the shutdown of schools, caused a considerable increase in the scientists’
workload at home that could impact research production differently across gender. In fact, the
more extensive involvement of women in family responsibilities, mainly care for children
(Schiebinger & Gilmartin, 2010), might have increased or relieved because of the presence of
men at home. Specularly, men might face more distractions and an intensification of domestic
responsibilities when confined to the home.
The implications of findings are twofold. First, any forecasts of the impact of research on
economic recovery and growth, might be misleading if based on R&D spending during the
pandemic. In fact, COVID-19 pandemic did not affect so much overall R&D spending, at least
by governments (Radecki & Schonfeld, 2020), while it did affect research productivity, as we
will show empirically. Second, if the pandemic unevenly affects research productivity across
gender, any research performance evaluation should account for that, in order not to disfavour

either gender in their careers and access to resources, and institutions with uneven gender
distributions of research staff.
The first empirical studies on the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on research activities
focused on the response from researchers to address health issues to minimize its impact. While
findings need to be verified at a later stage of the pandemic and in the years to come, from these
very first investigations we learn that the volume of publications for this topic noticeably
increased (Zang et al., 2020), while their quality seems below the quality average of other
articles in the same journals (Zdravkovic, Berger-Estilita, Zdravkovic, & Berger, 2020).
Differently from previous publications though, there seems to be a high degree of convergence
between articles shared in the social web and citation counts (Kousha & Thelwall, 2020).
Soon after, the focus of scholars extended to investigate the effect of COVID-19 also on
scientists’ behaviour and on research activities other than COVID-19-related research. In terms
of scientists’ research behaviour, it is evident that the pandemic emergency led to substantial
innovation in research collaboration and scholarly communication. The sense of urgency that
has pervaded the world scientific community has generated amounts of data sharing and
scientific research collaboration at levels that have never been seen before. It has been reported
a speed-up of open early-stage research sharing, with a surge of depositions to such preprint
archives as medRxiv and bioRxiv to foster large-scale early-stage research communication
(Callaway, 2020).
The question of whether pandemic is disproportionately hurting the productivity of female
scholars has been posed and empirically confirmed in different research disciplines and from
different data sources: among Italian astronomy and astrophysics researchers (Deleidi et al.,
2020); among neuro-immunologists (Ribarovska et al., 2021); among corresponding authors in
medRxiv, but not in bioRxiv (Wehner, Li, & Nead, 2020); in the physical-sciences repository
arXiv and, contrary to Wehner, Li and Nead (2020), in bioRxiv as well for the life sciences
(Frederickson, 2020); in 11 preprint repositories, expanding disciplinary coverage, and
especially on COVID-19-related research (Vincent-Lamarre, Sugimoto, & Larivière, 2020).
Also, early journal submission data suggest that COVID-19 is disproportionally plunging
women’s research production.2
Given that submission data are not publicly available, in the present study we recur to
preprint repositories as data sources. In the past few years, there has been a significant uptake
in posting preprint works in such repositories, to accelerate the diffusion of new knowledge.
Considering this, and differently from other studies on the subject, we measure the variation in
research production during the pandemic, by comparing research production in the pandemic
period with the expected one, as extrapolated from the trends, rather than with that in previous
period.
The paper unfolds as follows. In the next section we present methods and data. In the third
section we present the results of the empirical analysis. The final section is devoted to the
discussion and conclusions.

Data and methods
Initially, we have examined the appropriateness of a number of preprint archives to meet
our objectives and methodology. We discarded all of them but arXiv or bioRxiv. The reason
was that either they are too recent to be able to extrapolate the trends of posting, or the volume
of preprints is too small to assure robust elaborations. arXiv is a free online archive and

distribution service for unpublished preprints primarily for research in physics, astronomy and
mathematics. bioRxiv is the equivalent in the life sciences. We finally chose bioRxiv as the
only data source, because arXiv provides authors’ affiliations of a very small share of preprints
(around three percent), which makes it unsuitable for country-level analyses like the one we
intend to conduct.
bioRxiv was launched in 2013 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a not-for-profit research
and educational institution,3 recently obtaining support by the Chan-Zuckerberg initiative
(Callaway, 2017). First depositions occurred in November 2013.
Articles are not peer-reviewed before being posted online on this archive but undergo a
basic screening process for checking non-scientific content and plagiarism. Generally, an article
may be posted prior to, or concurrently with, submission to a journal so that the authors are able
to make their findings immediately available to the scientific community and receive feedback
on draft manuscripts.
Before the pandemic outbreak, very few bibliometric studies had used this platform as a
data source. Tsunoda, Sun, Nishizawa, Liu and Amano (2019) investigated the evolution of a
set of papers posted on bioRxiv and then published in academic journals. Fraser, Momeni, Mayr
and Peters (2019) investigated the citation and altmetric advantage of depositing preprints to
bioRxiv. Kenekayoro (2020) recently showed that although the platform is not yet mature
enough for reliable analyses, the exponential growth in preprint depositions suggests that this
data source will be soon a valuable resource for discovering interesting trends on emerging or
dying research fronts.
To observe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and of the consequent containment
measures on the production of novel scientific knowledge at a short temporal distance from its
outbreak, biorXiv appears particularly appropriate. Even assuming editors’ acceptance rates
unchanged, the use of a traditional bibliometric platforms (such as Scopus, WoS, Google
Scholar, Dimension or the like) would in fact require a longer time window considering the
average publication time of an article in a journal, and its indexing in bibliographic repertories.
Moreover, bioRxiv provides free and unrestricted access to all preprints posted on the
server. This applies also to machine analysis of the content. Metadata is made available via a
number of dedicated RSS feeds and APIs resources. For the purpose of this research, we used
a wget script for retrieving all publication metadata in XML format. Data extraction took place
on 16 December 2020. After retrieving all XML files related to the original deposition (version
1)4 of all preprints on the bioRxiv server, we implemented a parser in Python for extracting
relevant information from each XML file. More in detail, we extracted: date of deposition, doi
(record digital identifier in bioRxiv), author first names and last name, author position,
corresponding author, institution name and country, and subject area.
Since the full set of processed XML files from bioRxiv is deposited each month with
delivery completing typically in the first days of the subsequent month, we can be confident
that the dataset contains all depositions up to 31 November 2020.
The full retrieved dataset is made of 106,050 preprints, showing a quadratic growth along
years up to the 2020 pandemic: 77 depositions in 2013, 848 in 2014, 1704 in 2015, 4590 in
2016, 11191 in 2017, 20512 in 2018, 29018 in 2019, and 38110 in 2020. The overall distribution
by bioRxiv subject area is shown in Table 1.
For the identification of the gender of each author we queried the “Gender API” platform 5
by the “first name”+”affiliation_country” pair. Since the level of standardization of bioRxiv
retrieved data was not very high, some initial effort was needed for manually cleaning and

Spatiotemporal analysis of the pandemic impact

The bioRxiv monthly depositions in Figure 1 fit a quadratic trend up to the end of spring
2020,6 with a peak in June 2020. After that, we observe an abrupt inversion of the curve,
indicating a disruptive effect of the pandemic on research production.

To better appreciate the spatiotemporal dynamics of depositions before and after the
pandemic outbreak, we stratify the data by geographical area. To start with, we identify the

corresponding author of each preprint, the relevant affiliation and the corresponding
geographical macro-area.
Out of 106,050 preprints, 97,891 (92.3%) show at least one corresponding author (124,593
in total, as few publications have more than one). 101,647 corresponding authors (81.6% out of
total) are provided with an affiliation7, which can be unequivocally localized in a country and
then in a geographical macro-area.
Figure 2 shows the plots of the time series depositions in three macro-areas: Europe, North
America (including Canada, USA, and Greenland) and Far East (including China, Japan, Korea
and Taiwan). The dot lines represent the quadratic interpolation of the yearly moving average,
as measured from November 2013 to April 2020 for the Far East, and to June 2020 for Europe
and North America. In order to better visualize the curve inversion in the last period, the plot
starts from 2016.
The abrupt inversion of the trend is more noticeable in Europe and North America than in
the Far East. The time series reflect the timing of pandemic outbreak in the different
geographical areas, occurring first in the Far East but with relatively weaker effects.
It is important to notice that the average number of corresponding authors per preprint
hardly changes after the pandemic outbreak (1.27 up to June 2020; 1.29 afterwards. Therefore,
all trends observed with reference to the corresponding authorships remain valid for the
preprints as well.

A gender analysis of COVID-19 impact on research production
We repeat the previous analysis further stratifying the dataset by country and gender. To
discriminate gender, the first name of the author is needed alongside the country of affiliation.
We discard all corresponding authors to which the Gender-API is not able to associate a gender
with an accuracy equal or above 90 percent. The dataset for this analysis consists of 77,156
corresponding authors, representing 61.8 percent of 24,593 total corresponding authors in

With respect to the world level trend, every month presents average systematic variations, ranging from a
minimum of -11.6% in December to a maximum of +5.5% in March in the overall period observed.

unequivocally localized in a country.
Figures 4 to 6 show the time series for preprints posted by corresponding authors affiliated
respectively to European, North American and Far Eastern research organizations. To the eye,
comparing the “expected” and “observed” curves around the pandemic outbreak, it seems that
the plunge in production in Europe and in the Far East is much more severe for men than for
women, while it is more or less the same in North America.

A more in-depth analysis though, which takes into account also the seasonality of
depositions, reveals that for North America (Table 3) the plunge in depositions is more
conspicuous for women (-12.0%) than for men (-8.9%), similarly to the Far East (-6% vs
+1.6%). In Europe instead, it is men who experienced a worse decrease in depositions (-18.8%
vs -17.0%).

We delve the analysis at country level considering the U.S., China, and the top eight
European countries per number of depositions. Findings in Table 4 confirm the unbalance
showed in Table 3 in the U.S., where female scientists reduced the output of their research
activities at a higher rate than their male colleagues, -13.6% vs -9.3%. The same occurs in
China, but to a less extent: -5.5% for females vs -3.0% for males. In Europe, contrasting
evidences emerge. In France, Italy, Netherlands, and Switzerland it is women who are hurt
more, while in Germany and Spain the opposite holds true. Quite surprisingly, in both countries
female scientists raised their depositions with respect to the expected ones, respectively by 10
percent and 45 percent, while males decreased theirs by 15 percent and 9 percent. In Sweden
and U.K., gender differences are hardly noticeable. It must be said that the more fine-grained
the analysis the less robust the results, because of the lower number of observations.
Nevertheless, what emerges at continental level is often untrue at country level, where the
interplay of different containment measures, women’s role in society, and family-related
infrastructure unveil quite different realities.

Conclusions
The human impacts of COVID-19 infections, and pandemic-related limitations and
impediments are vast. These include disruptions to researchers that, as we showed, differ by
nation and gender. In this work, we have investigated the impact of pandemic on research
output. Results confirm what was expected that is a general plunge in preprint depositions,
following the pandemic outbreak, consistent in timing across geographical areas: in China and
the Far East first, in Europe and North America then. Probably, we will never see the
consequences of the slowdown in scientific production caused by COVID-19 pandemic, in
terms of published articles, as journal editors can simply raise their acceptance rates to keep the
volumes unchanged. Most likely, we will witness lower average quality of publications.
Evidence of that can be assessed in the years to come. Editors though might give now a precious
contribution to scholars in the field by providing them with data on submission variations after
the pandemic outbreak.
Contrary to what most people might expect, and early studies have announced, that female
scientists are hurt more by pandemic due to the increase in family care workload, we could
observe that this holds true at world level while significant exceptions occur at country level.
The important lesson to be learnt is that world level analyses often hide significant differences
across countries, especially when country-specific variables play a significant role in
determining the outcomes.
Why gender differences occur across countries would require further investigation by
scholars knowledgeable about the single country under observation. As for Italy, results are not
surprising to us. In Italy women’s relative share of involvement in family responsibilities,
mainly care for children but also for parents and parents-in-law, is more extensive than in
average EU countries. In Italy, for example, only 24 percent of the children go to kindergarten,11

Pandemic containment measures spared kindergarten, which remained open most of the pandemic period.

not allowing parents to be full-time occupied (Istat, 2019). Percent of population ages 65 and
older (often associated with high levels of morbidity) is 24 in Italy, among the highest in the
world (PRB, 2020). According to a recent survey, the majority of Italians totally agreed on the
statement: “The most important role of a woman is to take care of her home and family” (EU,
2017).
Findings might be of interest to scholars in scientometrics, in the economics of innovation,
and in sociology. The pandemic effects on research can inform policy makers when dealing
with economic forecasts, gender equality issues, research evaluation exercises, and the
assessment of the effectiveness of relevant policies and initiatives.
We appreciate several limitations embedded in our study. The field of analysis is limited to
the life sciences, therefore findings and conclusions cannot be generalized to other disciplines.
Data extraction was conducted during the pandemic, whose expiration is hopefully expected to
occur in the next few months. Therefore, the extent of the effects that we tried to grasp is to be
confirmed by future updates. It is the intention of the authors to extend the period of
investigation to June 2021, in order to provide the ISSI conference participants with up-to-date
and more robust findings.
Future research might entail investigation on the pandemic impact on research collaboration
behaviour. It is to be expected in fact that intra-muros collaborations must have lost their
advantage over extra-muros, as physical presence and personal contacts were inhibited by
containment measures.
