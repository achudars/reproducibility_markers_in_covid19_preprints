Pandemic modeling and the renormalization group equations:
Effect of contact matrices, fixed points
and nonspecific vaccine waning

Abstract
In this paper we find common features between the equations that are used for
pandemic or epidemic modeling and the renormalization group equations that are used
in high energy physics. Some of these features include the relation of contact matrices
in pandemic modeling and operator mixing in the renormalization group equations.
Another common feature are the use of flow diagrams and the study of fixed points
both in pandemic modeling and in evolution under renormalization group equations.
We illustrate these relations through the study of some cases of interest to the current
COVID-19 pandemic. These include pandemic modeling with mixing between different
age groups and also contact matrices associated with contact between countries. For
the final example we study the effect on mortality of waning from nonspecific vaccines
which are designed to combat different pathogens but nevertheless may lessen the
severity and mortality of COVID-19 infections.

Introduction

It is well known that in physics phenomena that are governed by the same type of equations
can benefit from the sharing of techniques for the solution and visualization of the solutions
to those equations. For example the simple harmonic oscillator and electronic circuits
are described by similar equations and insight from one equation can be applied to the
other. The first order nature of the differential equations used in compartment models
for epidemic modeling draw a striking resemblance to the renormalization group equations
used to describe high energy physics models. Essentially each compartment or the number
of class of individuals in the model correspond to a coupling constant in the high energy
physics model. One can even go beyond this and draw a closer relation to scaling structure
of virus spreading and evolution of a physics model under change in scale [1][2]. In this
paper we illustrate the relation between. the techniques used in high energy physics and
apply these to cases of interest to pandemics with similar characteristics to the current
COVID-19 pandemic.
This paper is organized as follows. In section one we give a basic introduction to our approach. In section two we give the basic equations that are used in pandemic and epidemic
modeling based on classifying individuals in different compartments. In section three we
give the basic renormalization group equations of high energy physics associated with coupling constants. We show how basic solution techniques and visualizations involving flow
diagrams can also be applied to compartment models of pandemic modeling and how these
can be used to identify fixed points of final state equilibrium in pandemic modeling. We
also draw a parallel between the between pandemic contact matrices and operator mixing
where a coefficient of an operator that may be zero at some scale nevertheless can become
nonzero at a different scale through mixing with other operators in the theory. In section
four we illustrate the above relations using contact matrices between different age groups
using demographics and pandemic characteristics similar to the current COVID-19 pandemic. In section five we further illustrate the techniques using contact matrices between
different countries which encounter the virus through delayed interaction and visualizing
the curves for infection and mortality during the pandemic. In section six we study the
effect of nonspecific vaccines that do not prevent infection but may lessen the severity and
mortality of the pandemic by studying the model with separate age groups both with and
without the use of a nonspecific vaccine. Finally in section seven we state the main conclusions of the paper and opportunities for further exploration of the common features of
pandemic modeling and remormalization group equations.

Equations of compartment models of epidemics

Starting with the pioneering work of Kermack and McKendrick [3] epidemic models can
be described by nonlinear differential equations. For example the basic equations of the
compartmental SIR model of epidemics are as follows [4][5][6][7]:
S 0 (t) = −βS(t)I(t)
I 0 (t) = βS(t)I(t) − γI(t)

(2.1)

0

R (t) = γI(t)
with initial conditions
S(0) = S0 , I(0) = I0 , R(0) = R0

(2.2)

Here S is the fraction of the population of susceptible individuals, I is the fraction of
infected individuals and R is the fraction of recovered individuals. In these equations β
and γ are constants associated with the epidemics that determine the likelihood of infection
and the rate of recovery.
Another model that we will use is the SIRD model which is similar to the SIR model
but takes into account mortality associated with the infection. For the SIRD model the
compartment equations are:
S 0 (t) = −βS(t)I(t)
I 0 (t) = βS(t)I(t) − γI(t) − µI(t)
R0 (t) = γI(t)

(2.3)

D0 (t) = µI(t)
with initial conditions
S(0) = S0 , I(0) = I0 , R(0) = R0 , D(0) = D0

(2.4)

Here S is the fraction of the population of susceptible individuals, I is the fraction of
infected individuals, R is the fraction of recovered individuals and D is the fraction of
deceased individuals. In these equations β, γ and µ are constants associated with the
epidemics that determine the likelihood of infection, the rate of recovery and the rate of
dying from the infection.
For small number of compartments these epidemic equations are not difficult to solve
numerically using software such as Mathematica or MATLAB [8]. In figure 1 we show
the numerical solution for an epidemic described by an SIR model for parameters (β =
3/2, γ = 2/3) with initial conditions (S0 = .999, I0 = .001, R0 = 0).

Equations of the renormalization group for high energy
physics

In the compartmental models of epidemics one has different compartments associated with
susceptible, infected , recovered and deceased individuals. In the renormalization group
equations of high energy physics instead of compartments one has coupling constants that
describe interactions in the high energy physics model. Instead of evolving the system of
equations in time as in the equations of epidemic modeling in the renomalization group
equation one has evolution with respect to energy scale whose logarithm is denoted as
t. Perhaps the most important system of renormalization group equations of high energy
physics is the equations governing the coupling constants of the standard model of high
energy physics [9]. These can be written as:
dλ

(3.3)

In these equations λ is the coupling constant of the Higgs boson, yt is the coupling constant
of the top quark and (g1 , g2 , g3 ) are the coupling constants the electroweak and strong
interactions. Looking at the structure of the system of differential equations describing the
renormalization group one can see that it describes a system of similar complexity to a five
compartment epidemic model. In the following sections we will consider models with eight
and twelve compartments of even greater complexity.
One can study a simpler form of renoramlization group equations associated with the
Higgs boson coupled to the top quark in a model referred to as the Yukawa model [10].
For this model one has two coupling constants and the renormalization group equations

In this form we see that the renormalization group equations of the Yukawa theory have a
strong resemblance to the system of differential equations used to describe the SIR model.
We may then expect that techniques and visualizations used in the renormalization group
equations should be applicable to the equations used in epidemic modeling. Below we
illustrate this using the example of flow diagrams and mixing terms in the equations.

Flow diagrams for renormalization group and epidemic modeling

The renormalization group flow diagrams illustrate fixed points in the renormalization flow
where the coupling constants do not change in scale. Thus they become fixed at whatever
value make the beta functions vanish. In the pandemic context a similar phenomena
happens when we reach a point in the pandemic when the number of susceptible, infected
and recovered individuals are not changing in time. This can occur if the number of
susceptible individuals dropped to a level that the pandemic is extinguished or it can also
occur if the number of infected individuals reaches a constant level in the population and
then the pandemic virus becomes endemic in the population. In such cases the fixed points
of the flow diagram represent points of endemic equilibrium in (S, I, R) space [11][12]. In
figure 2 we show the renormalization group flow for the Yukawa theory considered in [10].
It is clear from the diagram that the flow of coupling constant when the scale changes
goes to a fixed point in coupling constant space where the flow is stationary and the beta
functions or the right hand side of the renormalization group equations vanishes. In figure
3 we show a similar flow diagram for the SIR epidemic model. In this case we also see
that the flow goes to a point where the compartments I and S become stationary when the
epidemic has ended after the number of susceptible individuals drops to a level so that the
epidemic can no longer be sustained. It will also be important to study flow visualizations
over longer time scales where the virus can be come endemic and then recur at a later date.

Effect of epedemic contact matrix and mixing in the renoramalization group equations

The contact matrix is a symmetric matrix that indicates the number of contacts between
different groups. If the matrix is diagonal then the different groups do not mix. For
example if two countries are island countries and have no boat or air travel between them
then contact matrix will be diagonal. For the renormalization group one has an analogous
concept of operator mixing. This occurs because loop graphs induce new operators that
were not present in in initial renormalization group evolution. The matrix of coefficients
that describe this operator mixing is the anomalous dimension matrix and is analogous to
the contact matrix.
For the renormalization group equation the effect of operator mixing is described by
the anomalous dimension matrix γi,j through the equation:
dCi
= γij (C)Cj
(3.9)
dt
where Ci is the coefficient of an operator Oi . These matrices have an important physical
effect as operators which have vanishing coefficient at one scale but which develop a nonzero
value at a different scale through the mixing with other operators in the theory.
For the SIR model the contact matrix plays a similar role. In this case a subset
population may have a vanishing number of infections at one time but develop infections
through the contact with another segment of the population at a later time. This contact
matrix is proportional to the number of contacts between the different populations and is
represented in the differential equations of the SIRD model in a similar manner to the
anomalous dimension matrix in the Renormalization Group Equations. For the SIRD
model the effect contact matrix cij is given by [13]:
dSi
= −βi Si Ii − cij Si Ij
dt
dIi
= βi Si Ii − cij Si Ij − γi Ii − µi Ii
dt
(3.10)
dRi
= γi Ii
dt
dDi
= µi I i
dt
In these equations βi is the contact coefficient between susceptible and infected individuals
in group i, γi is the infection rate in group i and µi is the death rate in group i and cij
is the contact matrix between different groups. In the SIRD model Si is the number of
susceptible individuals in group i, Ii is the number of infected individulas in group i, Ri
is the number of recovered individuals in group i and Di is the number of individuals who
died in group i. The SIRD model has been applied to pandemics including the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic in [14][15][16]. We will give two examples of the use of the SIRD
model in grouping by age and also by country in the next two sections.

Effect of contact matrix between different age groups in
pandemic modeling

The contact matrix between different age groups can be important especially if one age
group is more susceptible or has a higher mortality rate than the other. For example the
older population may be more inclined to severe outcomes if they have weakened immune
systems or secondary health conditions. The other way around is possible too. Older
segments of the population may have been exposed earlier in life to a similar pathogen
and still retain some immunity while the younger population would not been alive during
this time and would be completely susceptible. Still another scenario is that the younger
population was vaccinated against a similar pathogen as part of routine child immunizations
wheres the older population either never received them or the effect of the vaccines have
waned leaving them vulnerable. The SIRD model among two age groups is given by an
eight compartment model [17]:
dS1
= −β1 S1 I1 − c12 S1 I2
dt

= β1 S1 I1 − c12 S1 I2 − γ1 I1 − µ1 I1

to be 60,000 and for group 2 the initial population taken to be 40,000 so that the total
initial population of the two groups is 100,000. The initial number of infected individuals
in group 1 was taken to be 100 and in group 2 it was taken to be 0. Solving these equations
with the parameters and initial condition we see that as the infections in group 1 go down
but once contact with group 2 is initiated the infections in group 2 increase and one obtains
a second peak of infections in group 2 with contributes substantially to the total number
of deaths due to the high mortality in group 2.

Often during pandemics segments of the population are kept from the susceptible part
of the population through stay at home orders. These segments may be added later to
susceptible pool at a later stage in the pandemic when restrictions are eased. This can
be modeled with nine groups from 0 to 80+ in ten year intervals as in figure 4 or as two
age groups one group under 50 and the other over 50 as in figure 5. In either case the

to the the effects of the contact matrix and initial infection in the younger age group.
Because of the higher mortality rate in the older age group the model predicts that most
of the deaths occur there. For the parameters that we chose in the SIRD simulation with
a susceptible population of 60,000 in the younger age group and 40,000 in the older age
group and we found that the number of deaths were 86 in the younger age group and 1283
in the older age group for at total of 1369 deaths out of the 100,000 population. This is a
dramatic illustration of the effect of the contact matrix between different age populations
in pandemic modeling.
It is important to note in the early phase of a pandemic such as from COVID-19 the
model parameters are not known accurately. These uncertainties can lead to a range of
predictions that depend on these uncertainties. Although there are several parameters in
the models we simulate we found the parameter β that indicated the interaction between
the susceptible and infected populations to be very important. For the simulation results
shown figure 6 increasing β by 10 percent lead to a peak in infection in the younger group
increasing from 12,000 to 13,800 and and an increase the peak in the older group from
8000 to 9500. Decreasing β by ten percent lead to a peak in infection in the younger group
with a decrease from 12,000 to 9500 and and an decrease in the peak in the older group
from 8000 to 7060. For the simulation results in figure 7 increasing β by 10 percent lead to
deaths in the younger group increasing from 86 to 89 and and an increase in deaths in the
older group from 1283 to 1335. Decreasing β by ten percent lead to deaths in the younger
to decrease from 86 to 82 and and an increase in deaths in the older group from 1283 to
1212.

Effect of contact matrix between different countries in
pandemic modeling

In this section we consider a simple three compartment model involving three countries
involved in virus spreading. In country 1 the virus starts an exponential growth pattern.
Travel between country 1 and country 2 takes place, followed at a later date by travel from
country 2 to 3. The three country model can be described by the twelve compartment
SIRD model:

With these parameters and also multiplying the contact matrix with a smoothed out step
function to model time delay in establishing contact between the countries we obtain the
results for infections in figure 8 and deaths figure 9. Note that when the first country has
contact with the second the infections in country 1 have dropped substantially nevertheless
there were enough cases to continue the pandemic into country 2. The same scenario then
repeats itself after country 2’s infections go down and contact starts between country 2
and country 3. The same step like effect can be seen in deaths in figure 9 where deaths
in country 2 pick up after contact is initiated with the initial infection in country 1 with
the same scenario continuing between country 2 and 3. Note the three separate peaks in
the number of infections which arise when travel restrictions are eased between countries
and the stair like structure in the number of deaths as the pandemic moves between the
countries. The number of deaths occurring assuming each country has a population of
100,000 is 1356 per country for a total 4068 deaths for the total population of the three
countries of 300,000. This is also a dramatic illustration of the effect of contact matrix in
this case between countries in pandemic modeling.
Again it is important to note in the early phase of a pandemic such from COVID-19
the model parameters are not known accurately. For the simulation results shown figure 8
increasing β by 10 percent lead to a peak in infection in the first country increasing from
19,560 to 23,020, an increase the peak in the second country from 19,630 to 23,030, and an
increase the peak in the third country from 19,630 to 23,025 . Decreasing β by ten percent
lead to a peak in infection in the first country with a decrease from 19,960 to 18,800 , a
decrease in the peak in the second country from 19,630 to 16,000 and a decrease in the
peak in the third country from 19,630 to 16,000 as well. For the simulation results in figure
9 increasing β by 10 percent lead to deaths in the first country increasing from 1350 to
1445, an increase in deaths in the second country from 1387 to 1445, and an increase in
the deaths in the third country from 1387 to 1417. Decreasing β by ten percent lead to
deaths in the first country to decrease from 1350 to 1323, deaths in the second country to
decrease from 1387 to 1324, and deaths in the third country to decrease from 1387 to 1324
as well.

Vaccine waning and indirect effects of nonspecific vaccines

There are two possible effects of vaccine waning in pandemic modeling. In the first case
a vaccine is developed specifically targeting the virus. Like the seasonal flu vaccine the
effectiveness of this vaccine can effectively wane perhaps in short enough time scales so
that people will lose immunity to the specific virus during the pandemic and will require a
booster to regain immunity [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25]. In the second case one sees some
efficacy from a vaccine which we call nonspecific to the pandemic virus but was developed
for a different pathogen but nevertheless may have some positive effects that result in
lower morbidity to the pandemic virus. In references [26][27][28] nonspecific vaccines that
are being studied including the MMR vaccine, the live attenuated Polio vaccine and the
BCG Tuberculosis vaccine. The effects of this nonspecific vaccine could also wane over
time. This can also lead to sporadic outbreaks of the original virus it was designed to
protect against as for example has been seen in outbreaks of mumps. If the nonspecific
vaccine has a positive effect against the pandemic then the effect of vaccine waning may
also contribute to age dependence of pandemic morbidity as vaccine waning may reduce
the effect of the nonspecific vaccine in older populations who have not received a booster
and have a longer time period from inoculation. The waning involved in the nonspecific
vaccine could be much longer than the time frame of the pandemic and the main effect
would be a contribution to the age distribution of pandemic morbidity.
Here we study a set of two SIRD models to study this effect. In the first model we
study a SIRD model with two age groups and no effect of the nonspecific vaccine.

In the second model we consider a SIRD model including a possible effect reducing the
morbidity with a greater effect on the younger age group due to possible waning of the
nonspecific vaccine. The amount of waning by age group is given in figure 10 and the effect

simulation are shown in figure 11. The model we used for the second SIRD model is given

Then we compare the results of these two models to see the effect of the nonspecific vaccine
and the pandemic. We see from figure 12 that the hypothetical nonspecific vaccine had
a positive effect on the mortality of the pandemic with a larger effect on the younger age
group. Parameters we used in this simulations are:

with the same contact matrix cij from (4.2). We see that there is an age related effect in
pandemic modeling somewhat similar to what is seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. It would
be very interesting add more compartments and to represent comorbidities in the different
age groups to more closely model the different age populations reaction to the disease.

We also see from figure 12 that the number of deaths in both age groups decrease with
the hypothetical nonspecific vaccine. We chose parameters in the SIRD simulation from
(6.3) with a susceptible population of 60,000 in the younger age group and 40,000 in the
older age group. We found that the number of deaths decreased from 158 to 86 with the use
of the hypothetical nonspecific vaccine in the younger age group. The number of deaths in
the older age group decreased from 1351 to 1283 with the use of the hypothetical nonspecific
vaccine. Overall the number of deaths in the total population of 100,000 decreased from
1509 to 1369 due to the effect of the hypothetical nonspecific vaccine using the parameters

(6.3) of the SIRD model. The effect in the older age group is less because of the vaccine
waning varying with the number of years from vaccination. The application of a booster
of the nonspecific vaccine to the older age group could be expected to lower the mortality
even further as more fatalities are recorded in the older age group where the mortality
rate is higher. It will be interesting to examine the projections for pandemic modeling as
more data becomes available on the effect of booster for nonspecific vaccines [26][27][28].
This type of analysis could also be important for specific vaccines as more data becomes
available from clinical trials and measurements are made as to the amount waning that
occurs for vaccines designed specifically for the pandemic pathogen [29].
Finally The number of infections per day remain the same with or without the nonspecific vaccines in the SIRD model we considered. This is because the nonspecific vaccines
reduce the severity of the illness and lower mortality but do not prevent infection with
the pandemic pathogen as would happen with a specific vaccine targeted to the pandemic
virus [29].
For early stages of pandemics model parameters are not known accurately. To gauge
the effects of parameter uncertainties in figure 12 we vary the important parameter β to see
its effects on the simulation. For figure 12 (left) increasing β by 10 percent increased the
deaths in the simulation without the nonspecific vaccine from 158 to 164 for the younger age
group and from 1351 to 1406 for the older age group. Decreasing β by 10 percent decreased
the deaths in the simulation without the nonspecific vaccine in the younger group from 158
to 150 and from 1351 to 1277 in the older age group. For figure 12 (right) increasing β by
10 percent increased the deaths in the simulation with the nonspecific vaccine from 86 to
89 for the younger age group and from 1283 to 1335 for the older age group. Decreasing
β by 10 percent decreased the deaths in the simulation without the nonspecific vaccine in
the younger group from 86 to 82 and from 1283 to 1212 in the older age group.

Conclusion

In this paper we have examined some similar concepts in the renormalization group equations of high energy physics and pandemic modeling based on differential equations. This
include the nonlinear behavior of the differential equations, the dependence on the initial
conditions and renormlalization group evolution, the similar nature of the contact matrix
between compartment groups in epidemic modeling and the notion of operator mixing and
fixed points in the renormalization group equations. We put these features together in
models with mixing between different age groups, mixing with different countries and the
effect of waning of nonspecific vaccines that were designed for different diseases but can
lessen the severity of infection and mortality for a pathogen associated with a pandemic.
In the future it would be interesting to extend these case studies using more data with
respect to different regions, age demographics and age related mortality. It will also be
interesting to extend the contact matrix study with different countries as travel is resumed
between countries with lower rates of infection. Finally we would like to update the model
associated with waning of nonspecific vaccines as well as specific vaccines as more data
becomes available from clinical trials about the effect of nonspecific and specific vaccines
on the rate of mortality for the pandemic.
