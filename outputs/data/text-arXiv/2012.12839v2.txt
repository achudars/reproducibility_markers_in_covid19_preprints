ABSTRACT
The Mumbai Suburban Railways, locals, are a key transit infrastructure of the city and is crucial for resuming normal economic
activity. Due to high density during transit, the potential risk of
disease transmission is high, and the government has taken a wait
and see approach to resume normal operations. To reduce disease
transmission, policymakers can enforce reduced crowding and mandate wearing of masks. Cohorting – forming groups of travelers
that always travel together, is an additional policy to reduce disease
transmission on locals without severe restrictions. Cohorting allows
us to: (𝑖) form traveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of
distinct interactions over time; (𝑖𝑖) potentially quarantine an entire
cohort if a single case is detected, making contact tracing more
efficient, and (𝑖𝑖𝑖) target cohorts for testing and early detection of
symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases. Studying impact of
cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of the
ensuing representational complexity. Agent-based models provide
a natural way to represent cohorts along with the representation
of the cohort members with the larger social network. This paper
describes a novel multi-scale agent-based model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19 dynamics in Mumbai.
We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a
detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents. Individual cohorts and their inter-cohort interactions as they travel
on locals are modeled using local mean field approximations. The
resulting multi-scale model in conjunction with a detailed disease
transmission and intervention simulator is used to assess various
cohorting strategies. The results provide a quantitative trade-off
between cohort size and its impact on disease dynamics and well
being. The results show that cohorts can provide significant benefit
in terms of reduced transmission without significantly impacting
ridership and or economic & social activity.

INTRODUCTION

COVID-19 is the worst public health disaster in the 21st century,
second only to the 1918 pandemic in the last 100 years. An estimated
36 million confirmed cases and over a million fatalities all over the
world have been reported as of 8th October 2020. The response to
the pandemic has varied across countries, but given that no pharmaceutical interventions were available, almost all countries instituted

significant social distancing measures to control the spread. As
an extreme measure, countries had enforced lockdowns to reduce
mobility in varying capacity. Data clearly shows that urban regions
were impacted far earlier than rural regions. Population density
and the resulting social interactions are important driving factors.
The pandemic has had significant impact on India thus far. The
Government of India acted early and instituted a nation-wide lockdown. The lockdown had a significant effect on urban and regional
mobility patterns1 . Like other parts of the world, Indian cities,
many of which have some of the highest population densities, have
been affected significantly by the pandemic. Mumbai, one of the
largest metropolises in the world with 12.4 million inhabitants
in the Brihanmumbai area2 is the economic hub of the country.
Mumbai has the highest population density in the country (over
32, 300 𝑝𝑒𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑒/𝑘𝑚 2 ), and has been significantly impacted by the
pandemic. Locals had a daily ridership of over 8.2 million passengers before the lockdown – this represents 20-40% of city’s total
population3 . Locals, the Mumbai suburban trains, are a lifeline of
the city and play a central role in the vibrant social and economic
activities of the metropolis, and resumption of service is critical for
the resumption of normal economic and social activities in Mumbai.
However, this can potentially contribute to a surge in disease spread
[18] since the locals and the stations are densely packed during
normal working hours. This creates a dense social network, ideal
for airborne disease transmission, with long distance edges that
can quickly spread the disease across the metropolis. The source
code for the simulator is open-sourced and available at
https://github.com/cni-iisc/epidemic-simulator/tree/mumbai_local

1.1

Our contributions and novelty

This is the first paper to explore and quantify the public health benefit of cohorting strategies while facilitating increased mobility and
economic activity. Policy makers are looking for ways to resume
the service of locals in Mumbai and this work enables just that.
Cohorts 4 are motivated by two central hypotheses. (𝑖) Two social
interaction networks with the same interaction density can have
varying impacts on disease dynamics; specifically, for small social
networks, locally dense but globally weakly connected networks
might be better at controlling the spread. (𝑖𝑖) It is easy to do contact
1 See https://ourworldindata.org/covid-mobility-trends.. Our results estimate that there
was over 70% drop in mobility in India [2]

tracing when travelers form cohorts; early and efficient contact
tracing followed by quarantining and monitoring of individuals
who came in close contact with the infected individuals can help
mitigate the disease spread. The first hypothesis is the rationale for
social bubbles [24] in the context of restricted social interactions.
From this perspective, cohorts can be thought as traveler bubbles.
They change the dynamic social network structure by creating
locally dense sub-graphs but reducing interactions between these
dense sub-graphs. The second hypothesis is that cohorting helps us
implement the test-isolate [25] strategy with greater efficiency. Together, cohorting can potentially help reduce the overall impact of
the epidemic while supporting social and economic activities — the
precise trade-offs of these two components is the focus of the paper.

spread), [17] (benefit of fine-grained model), [1, 9] (fine-grained
modeling of slums in Delhi and influenza spread), [32] (benefit
of using auxiliary data sources for modeling Ebola spread), [29]
(use of survey data to model behaviour), [3, 31, 34] (time-varying
graph networks), [28] (vaccination), [30] (ABMs for computational
epidemiology), [21, 26] (review of epidemic spread in complex networks) and [35] (impact of mobility on COVID-19 spread).
We shall focus only on those closely related to our work in this
paper. Mei et al. [22] developed a city-scale ABM for Beijing (6M
agents) using detailed demographic, mobility, socio-economic data.
The data they needed are quite detailed, the interventions modeled
have limited flexibility, and the test-isolate strategy is not modeled.
Cooley et al. [10] developed a city-scale ABM (7.5M agents) based
on survey data to study H1N1 epidemic spread in the New York
City. They calibrated the parameters based on the 1957-8 influenza
spread data. The interventions are limited to wearing masks, vaccinations and social distancing. They conclude that interventions
targeting the subway system alone are not sufficiently effective in
mitigating the infection spread. The papers [14, 16, 18] use a density
model developed in [15] for narrow and enclosed areas to study
the correlation between mobility and infection spread in crowded
spaces. The validation of these models are limited to statistical data
analysis [18] and small-scale simulations (200 – 100,000 agents)
[15, 16]. Social bubbles have been studied by [20, 24, 27] using
ABMs. However, these ABMs are modeled with limited interaction
spaces [20], or do not consider local demographic variations [27],
or limit the number of agents to about 100,000 [7].
In this work, we overcome several of the limitations highlighted
above. We model the interactions more realistically by considering
multiple and hierarchical interactions spaces like homes/neighbourhoods/communities, schools, and workplaces, in addition to
interactions during commute. Our simulator works with 12.4M
agents. The contact rate parameters are calibrated to the COVID-19
India data. The simulator enables time-varying interventions that
model on-ground policies (containment zones, lockdown fatigue,
compliance, contact tracing policies, and quarantine duration). Additionally, the simulator implements the test-isolate strategy.

Novelty. The work has a number of innovative components. This
includes the following. (𝑖) Multi-scale agent simulations: representing cohorts within a social network is challenging and calls for
a multi-scale approach – agents interacting through interaction
spaces instead of interacting directly with each other – in order to
reduce computational complexity without compromising the quality of the solution. Another multi-scale notion is that of hierarchical
interaction spaces that stratify interactions within a larger interaction space like in a workplace or a school or a neighbourhood. This
is essential for simulating contact tracing and the test-isolate strategy effectively. (𝑖𝑖) Multi-theory models: that incorporate multiple
social and epidemic theories. This includes theories of disease transmission and social choice theories (route choices to workplaces).
(𝑖𝑖𝑖) Calibration to diverse data sets. Agent models should be calibrated to complex measured data. We incorporate a large variety of
data to calibrate and validate the models. (𝑖𝑣) Evaluation of realistic
policies: Study of policies that are directly derived from needs on
the ground. The public health outcomes we derive from such a data
driven model provides innovative insights that can inform policy.

METHODOLOGY

of locals at stations under pre-COVID schedule. A leg represents
transit along a single train line that does not require any transfer. During instantiation, the pre-computed travel times are used
in determining shortest commute time route and corresponding
source-destination stations for individuals. In the simulator, the
pre-computed travel times are used to model the time spent in a
journey.

We implement cohorting strategies on top of a city-scale agentbased epidemic simulator. The agent-based simulator models interactions in households, workplaces, schools, neighbourhoods, and
communities. In this paper, we focus on the modeling and the implementation of cohorts as an additional interaction space related
to transportation.
The agent-based simulator consists of two components: (𝑖) a
synthetic city generator and (𝑖𝑖) a disease spread simulator that
simulates the spread of the infection on the generated synthetic
city. The synthetic city is generated taking into account the demographics of the city such as: age distribution, household size
distribution, unemployment ratio, commute distance distributions,
school size distributions etc. The synthetic city has as many agents
as the population in the city of interest.
An attribute particularly important to the current study is the
workplace location of an individual. We first assign a workplace
ward (Mumbai has 24 wards) to an individual in accordance with
the inter zone travel pattern given in Table 4 in [4]. The individual
is then randomly assigned a workplace in the workplace ward
(workplace location is uniformly distributed across a ward), with the
intention to match the commute distance distributions for Mumbai.
All interactions between agents are modeled via interaction
spaces to enable scalable computation at city-scale. Examples of
interaction spaces include train coaches, workplaces, households,
neighbourhoods. An agent can have membership to multiple interaction spaces, and disease spreads between agents via shared
interaction spaces. Additionally, we bring hierarchical interactions
spaces (project-team : workplace, neighborhood : wider-community,
class-rooms : schools) to enable modeling of test-isolate strategies.
The infection spreading model for an interaction space can depend
on the type of the interaction space.
The model for disease progression in an infected individual accounts for disease states such as susceptible, exposed, pre-symptomatic
and asymptomatic (to model asymptomatic transmission), symptomatic, hospitalised, critical, deceased and recovered, with agedependent state transition probabilities. The age-dependent state
transition probabilities are based on estimates in [33].
With all these attributes, agents constitute the nodes of a geospatial social contact network with mapped mobility. The city-scale
epidemic simulator takes (𝑖) the instantiated network (synthetic
city), (𝑖𝑖) the disease progression model, (𝑖𝑖𝑖) the intervention,
testing and contact tracing protocols, and then simulates the spread
of infection in the network. We expand on the modeling of the
transport interaction space and cohorts in the next subsections.

3.2

Cohorts

To model cohorts, in addition to the attributes mentioned above, we
first determine if an office-going agent would take the train to go
to work. For travel between home and workplace we optimize for
travel time across various modes of travel, accounting for frequency
and cost differential of road commute options compared to using
locals, the expected speed of travel via road 21.6 km/h [23] along
with geodesic to road detour index [8] (value considered for Mumbai
= 1.7), and multiple possible train stations an agent would consider
as the primary commute stations both for home and workplace
location. This allows us to know which agents take trains, and what
route they follow. Our generated data shows that about 30% of the
population takes train for daily workplace commute, which is inline
with the known ridership numbers of locals. Each cohort can have
up to 3 legs in the journey (based on locals routes), where each leg
represents travel along a single line of locals in a single coach.
All individuals in a cohort are assumed to travel together while
commuting. Hence they are assigned based on shared origin and
destination stations, that is every member of the cohort would
assemble at the common origin station, and then travel together to
the destination station together with other members of the cohort
and remain in the same train coach for each leg of the journey as
every other member of the cohort. In our simulation, individuals
are picked randomly to form a cohort as long as they share origin
and destination stations for commute. Cohort size is parameterized,
and the case of cohort size = 1 represents non-cohorting (business
as usual) scenario. Cohorts are formed at the start of the simulation
and stay same throughout the simulation.
3.2.1 Cohort-to-coach matching. Each day cohorts get assigned to
train coaches for their morning and evening commute. For every
train line (four in our case) and direction of travel, we initialise
an empty coach with a given seating capacity and a crowding factor. For any given section of travel, the number of individuals in
a coach cannot exceed the occupancy limit defined as the product
of seating capacity and the crowding factor. In other words, the
crowding factor captures the fact that the number of travelers in a
single coach almost exceeds the total number of available seats (by
a significant factor during normal operations). Our experiments
use crowding factor as one of the parameters that can be controlled
when formulating a policy. For each coach, we also keep count of
cohorts who could not be accommodated due to unavailability of
space. Next, we pick cohorts at random. For the chosen cohort, we
check if the existing coaches on the journey legs for the cohort (depending on their source destination pair, cohorts can travel across
multiple lines and hence could have more than one journey leg)
can accommodate the cohort. If the cohort can be accommodated
on all its journey legs, the cohort is assigned to the corresponding
coaches, and the capacity of the coaches along the cohort’s journey

Mumbai locals Dataset

We digitized the Mumbai Rail Map in [19], and captured train line,
train station, transit time between consecutive stations along a line,
along with station latitude, longitude information. We restrict ourselves to the census city limits of Mumbai and Mumbai suburbs, to
be consistent with agents being generated, and have 52 stations in
the network. This data is used to pre-compute shortest travel route
and corresponding time between any two stations across any line.
In determining total travel time, if a journey has multiple legs, each
transfer interval is assumed to be 7 minutes based on frequency

separating travelers into 2 pools–those traveling in cohorts and
those traveling individually. Each of these pools travels in separate
coaches, and in practice could travel in different trains at different
times to avoid infection spread at stations. We implement one-off
travel by earmarking a fraction of the office going individuals as
one-off travelers. The one-off travelers can be effectively viewed
cohorts of size one, while the remaining group is used to form
cohorts of required size. We assign separate coaches for one-off
travelers and normal cohorts, thereby restricting all interactions
between normal cohorts and one-off travelers. Even though we
don’t model the transition of an individual from one-off traveler
to cohort traveler, we expect this can be achieved via testing or
quarantining before joining a cohort.

MODELING DETAILS

Once the cohort assignments are done, the simulator proceeds in
time steps of 6hrs. The simulator is seeded with 100 infected individuals at the start of the simulation. The start of simulation, with
reference to actual timelines, is obtained as part of the simulator
calibration step; we discuss in more detail in Section 4.1. At time
step 𝑡, a susceptible individual 𝑛 is exposed to a daily disease transmission rate 𝜆𝑛 (𝑡). The computation of 𝜆𝑛 (𝑡) takes into account the
individual’s interactions in all the interaction spaces they are associated with. The strength of interactions between an individual and
the various interaction spaces are determined by the intervention
policy active at the given time step. The intervention policies are
chosen based on the announced policies by the government. Some
parameters (e.g., compliance parameter, contact tracing parameters)
are tuned so that the simulator output is in reasonable agreement
with the actual data from the city.
We model the contribution of an interaction space to an individual’s infection rate via a mean-field approximation of the infectivity
prevalent in the interaction space. Such an approximation helps
us to, (𝑖) avoid simulating pair wise interactions between individuals, and (𝑖𝑖) one common computation of the infectivity in the
interaction space suffices for all individuals in the interaction space.
Individual variations are modeled separately, but is easily implemented via the use of individual specific scaling factors. We follow
the same methodology for cohorts too. We describe the mean-field
approximations used in modeling cohorts in (1), (2) and (3).
Given the disease transmission rate seen by an individual, a
susceptible individual will be infected at the current timestep 𝑡
with probability (1 − 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−𝜆𝑛 (𝑡) × Δ𝑡 )), where Δ𝑡 is the duration
of the simulations timestep in days (1/4 in our simulations). Thus,
computation of 𝜆𝑛 (𝑡) for every individual at every timestep is a
key component of the simulator.
In this study, we introduce cohorts and model the contribution
from trains to an individual’s transmission rate. Contribution from
trains is modeled in two parts: 1) contribution from the same cohort,
which we call the intra-cohort interaction, and from other cohorts
that share a train coach with the cohort under consideration, which
we call the inter-cohort interactions. For cohort 𝑖, the intra-cohort
transmission rate is modeled as

legs is correspondingly reduced. If the cohort cannot be accommodated in at least one journey leg, the cohort is put back into bin of
un-allocated cohorts, and the counter on coaches that could not
accommodate the cohort is incremented. If the counter on a coach
exceeds a threshold (five in our simulations), the current coach
is pushed into an array of occupied coaches, and a new coach is
instantiated for that train line. We continue this till all cohorts are
assigned to coaches.
Assigning cohort-to-coach. We study two cohort-to-coach
assignment strategies – static and dynamic. Static assignment strategy is used to model the case where the coach assigned to a cohort
is fixed for each commute via a ticketing policy in practice. Specifically, each cohort takes the same coach each day in each direction,
and this coach is shared with the same cohorts each day as well.
Dynamic assignment strategy is used to model the case where the
ticketing policy is more relaxed, and each cohort can potentially
choose any train coach arbitrarily as long as they meet the basic
criteria of cohorting where every member of the cohort travels
together in the same coach. The dynamic strategy is easier to implement and requires minimal enforcement in practice compared to
static assignment. The impact of the strategies is evaluated and discussed in the paper later. Figure 2 illustrates the cohorting strategies
and their impact on network structure.
3.2.2 One-Off Travel. We model one-off travel for scenarios where
individuals may not have a fixed daily commute destination, by

perform calibration in two steps. We seed a fixed number of individuals (100 in our case) in exposed state at the start of the simulation,
and simulate a no-intervention (no mitigation strategies are enabled)
scenario. We then tune the transmission parameters for home, workplace and community (𝛽𝐻 , 𝛽𝑊 , 𝛽𝐶 ) to minimise the difference in
slopes of the log of cumulative fatalities seen in the simulator to
that of the actual cumulative fatalities observed in India between
26 March 2020 and 10 April 2020 (from 10 fatalities to 199 fatalities).
We consider the no-intervention policy for calibration as the fatalities before April 10 2020 can be assumed to have got infected prior
to imposition of any restrictions in India. A linear fit for the log
fatalities curve is based on the assumption that cumulative fatalities
grow exponentially with time, which was observed to be consistent
with actual data. We observe a good match in the slopes of the
fatalities curves for India and Mumbai, suggesting similar disease
transmission rates in Mumbai and in the whole of India in the initial
days of the pandemic.
Transmission parameters in interaction spaces are tied to one
of the above three parameters. For example, we assume that the
transmission parameter for a project team is nine times that of the
transmission parameter for the larger workplace. This is based on
the assumption that an individual spends 90% of the time in office
with their team members and only the remaining 10% with the
larger workplace group. We further try to equalise the contribution
of household, workplace and community towards disease spread.
We use stochastic approximation methods to arrive at the appropriate parameters values. Once we match the growth rate of fatalities,
we calibrate the start of simulation date with the actual fatalities
timeline, so that the time series of fatalities of the simulator matches
in expectation with the actual data.

to model the effect of various intervention strategies. For example,
when an individual 𝑛 ′ ’s cohort is quarantined, we set 𝜅𝑐 (𝑛 ′, 𝑡) to
zero, to model the individual’s lack of interaction via cohorts.

where 𝑖 denotes individual 𝑛’s cohort, and 𝜅𝑐 (𝑛, 𝑡) is the workplace
modulation factor for individual 𝑛.
Unlike other interaction spaces where the interaction space is
considered active for all simulation timeslots, for trains we consider
them active twice daily in two 6hr simulation timeslots. The first
timeslot corresponds to morning travel and the second timeslot
corresponds to evening travel.
In (3) we have assumed that, inside a coach, the interactions are
homogeneous among all individuals in the coach. This assumption
can be translated to uniform mixing of individuals in a coach. Even
though we can expect cohort members to stay together and hence
restrict interactions with other cohorts, the above assumption models the worst case scenario. The assumption is further reasonable as
it will be difficult to implement physical distancing between cohorts
and also to model the level of interactions between cohorts.
For cohorts, unlike the modeling of infection spread in other
interaction spaces where we assume that the number of interactions of an individual remains constant for a given time interval,
we assume that the number of interactions increases in proportion
to the number of individuals traveling in a coach. We assume a
linear increase in interactions as the number of individuals increase,
though one could consider other alternatives, such as a monotonically increasing concave function.

4.1.1 Calibration of 𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑐ℎ . Due to sparsity of data on the impact
of trains on disease transmission we have not been able to calibrate
𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑐ℎ independently. We use the following heuristic argument to
compute a nominal 𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑐ℎ from 𝛽𝐻 , where 𝛽𝐻 is the transmission
rate parameter associated with households.
The infection transmission rate seen by an individual 𝑛 from
their household at time 𝑡 is modeled as

household based modulation factor.
Thus, 𝛽𝐻 can be interpreted as the household transmission rate
per day for an individual. Let 𝑟 𝐻 denote the number of typical
contacts for an individual at home for a day. Then, the probability
𝛽
of transmission from a contact can modeled as 𝑝𝑐 = 𝑟 𝐻𝐻 .

Calibration of parameters

Like 𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑐ℎ there are other tunable parameters in the simulator
and it is important to tune the parameters to appropriate values
to obtain reasonable outputs and insights from the simulator. We

Intervention Modeling - Cohorts

In the specific case of cohorts, we study the impact of isolating an
entire cohort when an individual is hospitalised or tested positive or
is sufficiently symptomatic. When an individual is hospitalised or
tested positive, then all their cohort members are placed under self
isolation. A symptomatic individual may self-declare or be detected
at a station and that can also trigger isolation of the other cohort
members.

If we assume that the number of close contacts per day in a

In the simulator, for every simulation timestep Δ𝑡 , the transmission rate is further multiplied by Δ𝑡 to obtain the mean disease
transmitting contacts per simulation timestep. For trains, since we
already account for commute time, and since we assume that one
journey is restricted to one simulation time step, we need to discount the further multiplication by Δ𝑡 . Thus, a nominal value for
the 𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑐ℎ parameter we use in simulator, in terms of 𝛽𝐻 can be
obtained as

RESULTS AND KEY FINDINGS

Based on the methodology described in Section 3.2, 3.74M individuals take trains for daily commute in our simulations. In terms of
interventions, we consider a pre-lockdown period starting from
March 16 and lockdown extending till May 18 in Mumbai. From
May 18, the following interventions are active: (𝑖) 14 day home
quarantining of symptomatic individuals and their household members, for compliant households, (𝑖𝑖) social distancing by compliant
elderly (age > 65), (𝑖𝑖𝑖) schools are closed. Further, post May 18, we
assume a phased re-opening of offices, with 5% offices operating
till May 31, followed by 15% attendance till June 30, followed by
25% attendance till July 31, followed by 33% attendance till Aug
31 and full attendance thereafter. Further, we assume masks were
enforced from April 09. Compliance probabilities to the regulations
(including mask wearing) are 60% in high density areas and 40%
in other areas. Testing and contact tracing is active from March
16. On hospitalisation or identification of a positive case, contact
tracing, isolation and testing is triggered, based on a set of specified
probabilities. This models the test-isolate intervention. Trains are
assumed to start from September 07. Progressive containment of
wards based on number of hospitalised cases is active till the end
of August.
We run the simulation from mid February, but exclude presenting results for the duration prior to the anticipated restart date
for the locals. As an implementation detail, we built in our model
the ability to store and load state at any timestep, and were able
to store state for state prior to the anticipated locals restart date.
We only stored the infection state of individuals. Randomization
seed, and other parameters related to cohorting were not stored.
This ability to store once and load multiple times helped reduce

Intervention Modeling

A key feature of the simulator in [12] is its ability to simulate various
time varying intervention strategies. Interventions are modeled by
modulating an individual’s edge weights with various interaction
space. For example, when an individual is self-isolated at home,
contact rates with their household is reduced by 25%, contact rates
with their workplace is reduced to zero and contact rates with the
community is reduced to 10%. The simulator also supports testing
and contact tracing protocols. Contact tracing in the close network
of an individual can be initiated for each of the following events:
(𝑖) an individual is hospitalised, (𝑖𝑖) an individual tests positive, (𝑖𝑖𝑖)
an individual reports symptoms. The fraction of such events that
trigger contact tracing and the fraction of individuals who would
be contact traced are all configurable.

Figure 3: Y-axis represents daily new detected positive cases. Parameters which vary are labeled in the legend, where as parameters which don’t are noted above the plot. The shaded region represents 1 standard deviation away from the mean, estimated
over 5 simulation runs with the selected configuration. Beta represents 𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑐ℎ , the transmission rate parameter of the interaction in train coaches. Crowding represents the crowding factor of train coaches, which impacts occupancy limit of a train coach.
Isolation value of 0 or 1 represents lack or presence of cohort isolation policy respectively. Coach_strategy of 0 or 1 represents
static or dynamic coach assignment respectively. One_off_ratio represents proportion of travelers that travel one off, and the
remainder (1.0 − 𝑜𝑛𝑒_𝑜 𝑓 𝑓 _𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜) travel in cohorts of the selected cohort_size. Station detection represents the proportion of
symptomatic infected commuters detected at the station, via thermal screening or other testing mechanisms.
computation time significantly. In a few scenarios for long term projections and estimating network saturation, we run the simulator
for significantly longer duration.
In Figure 3, we plot new daily positive cases, which represent the
new cases detected on the specified date. This value is much lower
than the actual underlying new infections on that day. All plots in
the group peak and then trend downwards. To explain this, we plot
Figure 4 which shows that the cumulative detected cases to that
date side by side with new daily positive cases, and we observe that
the network saturates by Dec, with inflection point of new daily
positive cases in mid Oct, which matches with the peak of new
daily cases. Also interestingly we see that network saturation level
for larger cohort sizes is much lower, which shows that cohorting
helps reduce total cases significantly.
It is important to note that the daily positive cases take into
account interaction in other interaction spaces (household, office,
neighbourhood, community) in addition to the transport interaction
space. The plots thus show the impact of cohorting strategies on the
progression of the overall disease burden in the city. Another feature
of the simulator is that it models spatial variance in population

density and the associated increased contacts in slum areas, and
therefore increased spread in these areas. A third important feature
worth highlighting is that we model contact tracing, which help
contain the spread, this helps to not only match actual observed
cases, but also model the benefit of contact tracing enabled case
isolation in a realistic way.

Details

1. Impact of cohort size. Figures 3a and 3b show the change in
infection spread dynamics for various cohort sizes. We observe:
• Without isolation, all cohorts have similar dynamics.
• With isolation, we observe reduction in disease spread, as
potentially asymptomatic cases are removed from the mix.
• Significant reduction in disease spread is observed as cohort
sizes increases.
2. Impact of crowding factor. Figure 3c plots daily positive cases
for different crowding factors.
• Disease spread is extremely sensitive to crowding.
7

• Crowding factor of 1 without isolation has lower daily cases
than crowding factor 2 with isolation, suggesting that reducing the crowding in trains by half has more impact than
enforcing isolation of cohorts.
3. Impact of contact rate. In Figure 3d, we plot daily positive
cases for different 𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑐ℎ , the contact rate parameter for cohorts.
Since we do not have a calibrated 𝛽 value, it is important to study
the robustness of the results to various 𝛽 values. We observe:
(a) Cumulative positive cases

• Higher 𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑐ℎ values cause higher disease transmission.
• Higher 𝛽𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑐ℎ values reach the peak earlier.
• We observe similar trend in the disease progression curves
for different 𝛽 values, suggesting that the qualitative results
are robust to variations in 𝛽 values.

(b) Daily positive cases

total case load at saturation.
.

4. Impact of detection probability. In Figure 3e, we study the
impact of varying the detection probability of symptomatic individuals at stations. A detection triggers the isolation of the entire
cohort. Detection of positive symptomatic individuals is critical
for cohorting to succeed and could potentially be achieved using
thermal scanners at stations, and/or by employing random testing
of individuals at stations. As detection increases, spread of diseases falls, and without detection at cohorting has only marginal
improvement compared to no-cohorting scenarios.

tined in the city

5. Impact of inter-day cohort-to-coach assignment strategies.
In Figure 3f, we study the impact of static coach assignment, where
restricting cohorts to travel with the same set of cohorts on a daily
basis against a much relaxed policy of allowing cohorts choose their
train of choice and time of travel. The only restriction is that the
cohorts should travel together. We observe no significant benefits
from static coach assignment, suggesting strict coach assignment
may not be warranted.

Figure 5: As cohort size increases, there is a greater contribution of quarantined cases due to cohorting, but the increase
in total quarantined cases in the city is marginal.

6. Impact on count of quarantined individuals 5a shows that
the number of people quarantined due to cohorting increases with
increased cohort sizes. Interestingly, the increase in total number
of quarantined individuals in city due to cohorting is small (Figure 5b). This can be attributed to the observation that cohorting
with reasonable cohort size can reduce the daily positive cases
substantially, and stem disease progression (Figure 3a). Cohorting
is able to quarantine individuals even before testing, and contact
tracing mechanisms kick in, and has an ability to smartly identify
& isolate.
Figure 6: Effect of one-off travelers: As fraction of one-off
travelers increase, the daily positive cases increase but partial cohorting does far better than business as usual (cohort
size of 1).

7. Impact of one-off travel. Figure 6 shows the impact of allowing one-off travel along side cohorts. We assume one-off travelers
use separate coaches and thus avoid interacting with those in cohorts. Figure 6 (right) shows new daily positive cases detected
with increasing cohort sizes. We observe that even with significant
proportion of one-off travelers (40%), cohorting strategy reduces
disease transmission significantly.

Ideal Cohort Size

KEY FINDINGS AND POLICY
IMPLICATIONS
• Cohorting can significantly reduce disease transmission.
Larger cohort sizes are more effective at reducing disease
transmission.
• Effectiveness of cohorting depends on effectiveness of timely
case detection (via thermal screening for symptomatic cases

Even though our study finds larger cohort sizes attenuate disease
transmission more severely, there are practical considerations like
coach capacity utilization, and enforceability of isolation policies.
In practice a cohort size of 12 to 20 might be more appealing.

at stations) and isolation (enforcing quarantine for all cohort
members when a single member is detected to be positive).
Static coach assignment does not have significant impact
on reducing disease transmission as compared to dynamic
coach assignment.
Disease transmission is most sensitive to crowding in trains,
and crowding needs to be effectively managed. While reducing crowding on train coaches, care must be taken to not
crowd the stations. This aspect needs to be studied further.
One-off travel up to 10% will only show marginal increase
in disease transmission, and even at 40% one-off travel, disease transmission can be significantly reduced by cohorting.
There is benefit in incremental implementation of cohorting.
While the model has focused on Mumbai metro rail system,
we believe these findings are generally applicable to other
public transit systems (like metros, buses) in India as well
other large metropolitan areas.
