Abstract
Since the beginning of 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly
in the city of Wuhan, P.R. China, and subsequently, across the world. The swift spread of
the virus is largely attributed to its stealth transmissions in which infected patients may be
asymptomatic or exhibit only flu-like symptoms in the early stage. Undetected transmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus and pose an appalling
threat to the public. An urgent question that has been asked by the public is “Should I be
tested for COVID-19 if I am sick?”. While different regions established their own criteria
for screening to identify infected cases, the screening criteria have been modified based on
new evidence and understanding of the virus as well as the availability of resources. The
shortage of test kits and medical personnel has considerably limited our ability to do as many
tests as possible. Public health officials and clinicians are facing a dilemma of balancing the
limited resources and unlimited demands. On one hand, they are striving to achieve the
best outcome by optimizing the usage of the scant resources. On the other hand, they are
challenged by the patients’ frustrations and anxieties, stemming from the concerns of not
being tested for COVID-19 for not meeting the definition of PUI (person under investigation). In this paper, we evaluate the situation from the statistical viewpoint by factoring
into the considerations of the uncertainty and inaccuracy of the test, an issue that is often

the general public understand and assess the situation rationally. Most importantly, the development offers recommendations for physicians to make sensible evaluations to optimally

Introduction

The first case of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was found in December of 2019
in Wuhan city, Hubei providence, P. R. China. On December 31, 2019, China informed the
World Health Organization (WHO) of a case of novel viral pneumonia in Wuhan (Wong
et al. 2020). Since the diagnosis of the first case, this virus has spread with astonishing
speed and has caused many infections and a good number of deaths. The origin of the virus,
however, remains unclear. An abrupt announcement was made on January 23, 2020 that the
city of Wuhan was locked down to control the spread of the virus. Subsequently, almost all
areas in China have begun to take serious public health measures to contain the virus (Xiao
and Torok 2020).

On January 30, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. By March 2, 2020, China had confirmed 80,174 infected cases and 2915
deaths. From February 27 to March 11, 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 outside
China has increased 10-fold and the number of affected countries has increased to be 113. As
of March 11, 2020, there have 118,429 confirmed cases and 4,292 deaths (WHO, Situation
Reports 2020). The number of cases, the number of deaths, and the number of affected
countries are expected to climb in the coming days and weeks. On March 11, 2020, WHO
declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.

COVID-19 has been found to be caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); certain epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with
COVID-19 have been reported. However, comprehensive knowledge of COVID-19 still remains incomplete. For instance, the risk factors for mortality and the clinical course of the
illness have not been well understood (Zhou et al. 2020). The early presentation of COVID19 infection is typically nonspecific. Some infected cases may be asymptomatic, while many
infected individuals often show flu-like symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, low-grade
fever, or malaise in the first few days (Wong et al. 2020). The seeming-flu symptoms have
created difficulties in differentiating COVID-19 from the common cold and seasonal influenza.

The mystery of the virus and the lack of effective treatment for COVID-19 have presented a striking threat to the public. In contrast to the rapid transmission of the COVID19 pandemic, news on COVID-19 has traveled swiftly and broadly through internet, radio,
newspaper, television, social media, and so on. The wave of fear has escalated in the public. Though it has been reported that people with medical complications are at a greater
risk of suffering from COVID-19, the general public also has the fear of contracting the virus.

Clinicians have been under tremendous pressure to triage the high volume of patients for
COVID-19 testing. To receive medical care as early as possible, an urgent question that has
been asked by patients with flu-like symptoms is “Can I be tested for COVID-19?” More
broadly, the public may be puzzled by the concern, “To achieve an effective containment of
the virus, why does the government not take a proactive action to test everyone for COVID19 to identify all infected individuals in a timely manner?”

Due to the limited availability of trained personnel, testing kits, and PPE (personal protective equipment), it is impossible to test everyone with flu-like symptoms for COVID-19,
let alone to test every individual. While these reasons can easily be perceived by the public,
the underlying scientific reasonings do not seem to be considered. More importantly, due to
the limited availability of resources, the protocol of screening patients for testing COVID-19
can be stringent to prevent a collapse in medical facilities. Based on the evolving global situation, the screening process is constantly being updated and differs from country to country.
Initially, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended testing
only people with respiratory symptoms such as fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and
those who had potentially been exposed to the virus. With the evidence for community
transmissions, the CDC updated its recommendations on March 4, 2020 to allow anyone
with respiratory symptoms to be tested as long as the request is approved by a doctor,
though the CDC is encouraging physicians to minimize unnecessary testing by considering
patients’ exposure risks (Ferran 2020).

From the medical perspective, testing for COVID-19 has crucial implications and importance. It is impossible to fight the virus blindly without knowing the target population.
The early diagnosis of infected patients is essential to manage the situation. Infected people must be isolated to control the virus spread; potentially infected individuals should be
quarantined to minimize the possibility of infecting healthy people; and vulnerable people
such as the elderly and patients with chronic health issues need to be secluded to prevent
infection. Necessary medical attention must be focused on patients at high risk who require
immediate medical intervention to prevent mortality. In a broader spectrum of learning and
dealing with the virus, acquiring accurate data of infection and transmission is critical for
researchers to unveil the correct profile of COVID-19 to implement more effective clinical
management.

In response to the increasing need for testing for COVID-19, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) announced on February 29, 2020, a new policy that made it easier for
commercial and academic laboratories to develop their own tests and allowed other certified
labs to test patient samples. Companies, hospitals and institutions are now racing to develop
more tests to diagnose COVID-19. On March 10, 2020, Alex Azar, secretary of Health and
Human Services, announced that 2.1 million testing kits were available and more than 1
million have shipped to certified labs for testing (Ferran 2020).

With the urgency of identifying infected cases and increase in available test kits, screening
criteria for testing COVID-19 have become less restrictive than at the initial stage. It now
seems quite tempting to take aggressive action to adminster COVID-19 tests to as many
patients as possible. However, an important yet overlooked issue is on the imperfectness
of test procedures. It is imperative to enhance our understanding of testing for COVID-19
by factoring in the assessment of the uncertainty, randomness and imperfectness associated
with the test procedures; otherwise, misleading and erroneous outcomes can be produced.

In this article, we examine the concerns of testing COVID-19 from the statistical standpoint. Our explorations are purely based on accounting for the uncertainty and randomness
3

associated with medical test procedures. We will look at the uncertainty induced from the
test procedures and assess the degree of the resulting false results. Our explorations are
intended to shed light on the question “Should everyone be tested for COVID-19?”, which
would assist general people to assess situations with rational and evidence-based thinking.
Ultimately, as advocated by Sharkawy (2020), the public should face the challenge of COVID19 with educated reasoning and compassion for others. Everyone should seek truth and facts,
as opposed to conjecture and speculation; we all must work together to battle COVID-19.

This article provides a dynamic framework to present the evolving features of COVID-19.
We examine test procedures in terms of their sensitivity and specificity, and quantify the
degrees of false test results under various scenarios. Most importantly, we make sensible
recommendations for physicians to balance the usage of limited test kits and the accuracy
of the test outcome. We offer the assessment as to how likely we may miss identifying
COVID-19 carriers based on consecutive negative results and how many times we should
test a suspected COVID-19 patient to reduce the chance of errors. Our discussion provides
the guidelines for discharging patients who are treated as COVID-19 carriers.

Notations and Framework

For generality, we use the term population to describe the group of subjects of our interest.
In the following discussion, population may represent the collection of all people in a country, a city, or a region; it may also refer to a cohort of individuals, a ward of patients, or a
community of people. We first introduce abstract symbols to represent the quantities of our
interest. To facilitate the dynamic feature of COVID-19, we include the dependence on time
in the notations.

On day t with t = 1, 2, . . ., suppose our target population has N (t) people in total in which
Nh (t) people have no COVID-19 and Ns (t) people have COVID-19. Let P (t) = Ns (t)/N (t)
be the prevalence on day t. Before patient zero (i.e., the first person who has COVID-19)
4

appears, no one in the population has the virus. So we assume that when t = 0, Ns (t) = 0,
and when t = 1, 2, . . ., Ns (t) ≥ 1. That is, P (t) = 0 for t = 0 and 0 < P (t) ≤ 1 for
t = 1, 2, . . .. Due to the dynamic feature and the spread of the virus, the relative size of
Nh (t) and Ns (t) varies with time t. Initially, Ns (t) is negligible and Ns (t)  Nh (t) for t in
a certain interval, say [1, T1 ], i.e., P (t) is near 0. As outbreaks occur and the pandemic is
declared, it is possible that Ns (t) ≈ Nh (t) for t in a certain interval [T1 , T2 ], say, yielding
P (t) ≈ 1/2. In the worst scenario, Ns (t)  Nh (t) for t in a certain time period [T2 , T3 ], say,
leading to P (t) ≈ 1. Eventually, we hope that the state of coming back to Ns (t) ≈ 0 or
P (t) ≈ 0 for t in the interval [T3 , ∞) will be reached with T3 being as small as possible.

For any individual in the population, we are interested in the COVID-19 status for this
individual. Let Y be the binary variable showing the true status for an individual to have
COVID-19, with Y = 1 if having COVID-19 and 0 otherwise. In reality, the true value of
Y is unknown for any individual, and we can only apply proper medical tests to find out an
individual’s disease status. To feature this, let Y ∗ represent the test result for an individual
who is tested; Y ∗ = 1, if the test result is positive; and Y ∗ = 0, if the test result is negative.

However, no medical test is 100% accurate in practice. There is a chance that a medical
test can give us an incorrect result. To describe the accuracy of a test, we use two useful
measures, called the sensitivity and the specificity, which are respectively defined as
psen = P (Y ∗ = 1|Y = 1) and pspe = P (Y ∗ = 0|Y = 0).
Basically, the sensitivity psen is a measure to show how sensitive the test is to testing
diseased subjects. It reports the probability that a test successfully confirms the true status
for an individual having the disease. In other words, the value of psen indicates the success
rate of the test when applied to the subpopulation of diseased people, so the sensitivity psen
is also called the true positive rate. An accurate test is expected to have a value near 1.

Paying attention to the sensitivity psen only is, however, not enough to characterize the
goodness of a test. A good test should also be accurate in terms of correctly showing the
5

result for people who do not have the disease. To this end, the specificity pspe comes into the
play. It measures the probability that the test successfully reveals the disease-free status for
any individual who has no disease. The value of pspe indicates the proportion of the time for
obtaining the correct result when the test is applied to the subpopulation of healthy people.
Consequently, the specificity pspe is also called the true negative rate. A good test is also
expected to have pspe close to 1 to keep the number of misdiagnosed cases small.

Corresponding to the true positive rate and the true negative rate, the complement probabilities 1 − psen = P (Y ∗ = 0|Y = 1) and 1 − pspe = P (Y ∗ = 1|Y = 0) are also useful to
describe the test outcomes. These two measures are called the false negative rate and the
false positive rate, respectively.

Because medical tests are not always accurate in testing diseased or non-diseased individuals, it is important to take into account the uncertainty and randomness when interpreting
a test result. To make a sensible decision, it is necessary to understand how to evaluate
the risk of receiving a false result when applying a test. Ultimately, our goal is to make an
educational and evidence-based decision for the health care. Specifically, we are interested
in evaluating two numbers of concern,
#fp (t) = the number of false positive on day t if everyone in the population is tested,
and
#fn (t) = the number of false negative on day t if everyone in the population is tested.
It is easily seen that those numbers are determined by the size of the diseased subpopulation and the size of the non-diseased subpopulation as well as the sensitivity and the
specificity of the test. That is,
#fp (t) = Nh (t) × (1 − pspe ) and #fn (t) = Ns (t) × (1 − psen ).

Should Everyone Be Tested?

To understand how medical tests with different sensitivities and specificities may perform,
we consider the scenario where the population has possibly different prevalence for different
days. We make recommendations by examining how the number of false negative #fn (t) and
the number of false positive #fp (t) are determined by the sensitivity and specificity of the
test procedure as well as the prevalence of the disease.

3.1

Tracking Patient Zero

To visualize the relationship between the false negative number #fn (t) and the sensitivity
of the tests, we start with an example with N (t) = 10, 000 for a given day t and apply
a sequence of tests with different sensitivities to everyone in the population. We show the
results in Figure 1 for a range of prevalence. As expected, the false negative number drops as
the sensitivity of the test becomes higher, and the drop rate is higher for the population with
a bigger prevalence than that with a smaller prevalence. When the prevalence is very small,
say, P (t) = 10−4 , or equivalently, P (t) = 1/N (t) here (i.e., when patient zero just presents
in the population), the false negative number is below 1 no matter what the sensitivity of
a test is. In this case, testing everyone for COVID-19 would not virtually yield any false
negative result.

In general, in the very beginning of the presence of patient zero (i.e., at time t = 1), the
population has Ns (1) to be 1 or nearly 1. If everyone is tested for COVID-19, then
#fn (1) = Ns (1) × (1 − psen ) < 1
regardless of the accuracy of test procedures. To track the origin of COVID-19 for a population, we recommend to test everyone in a group of presumptive patients who may potentially
include patient zero; this is the only way to identify patient zero, yet it is unnecessary to worry
about obtaining false negative results, no matter how inaccurate the test procedure could be.

In reality, it is often difficult to immediately identify the presence time of patient zero in
a cohort based on the confirmation of infected cases. The discussion here offers a possible
7

way to track patient zero retrospectively by examining the samples of suspected patients.
Checking the sample of every suspected patient by the reverse time order is needed to identify patient zero in the cohort.

Recommendation 1: To identify patient zero, it is recommended to test everyone in a

600

presumptive group which may potentially include patient zero.

Testing for COVID-19

We now visualize the relationship between the false positive number #fp (t) and the specificity
of the test. Figure 2 shows the results for populations with a common size N (t) = 10, 000 but
with different prevalence. The false positive number becomes smaller when the specificity of
the test becomes higher. Interestingly, the decreasing rate appears fairly stable regardless
of the prevalence value, though those drop rates are not identical. For a given test, the
false positive number is bigger for a population with a smaller prevalence, and the difference
between two populations with different prevalence tends to be negligible, especially for those
tests with a high specificity. In a population with 10,000 people, the false positive number
8

can be as high as 6,000 if a test of the specificity around 40% is applied to everyone in
the population; the false positive number can be lowered to about 1,000 if everyone in the
population is tested with a procedure having a high specificity (such as 95%). Given that
even for the best scenario the false positive number is still around 1,000 for a population
of size 10,000, we conclude that it is not sensible to test everyone in the population for a
disease without discretion (even if it is affordable in terms of availability of resources and
the cost).

Recommendation 2: Do not test everyone for COVID-19 without discretion.

To further illustrate this, we consider two examples. The accuracy of the current COVID19 tests is not precisely known. Based on the test performance in China and the performance
of the influenza tests, Hutchison (2020) suggested that the sensitivity and specificity of

6000

COVID-19 tests were estimated to be 60% and 90%, respectively.

Test Specificity

Figure 2: The false positive number versus the specificity of a test for populations with the
common size 10,000 but different prevalence

Example 1: As of March 16, 2020, there were 8 confirmed cases in Waterloo Region,
9

Ontario, Canada (CBC News 2020), whose population size is about 601,220 (Region of
Waterloo 2019). That is, P (t) ≈ 0.00099797% for t representing the day March 16, 2020. If
we would test everyone in Waterloo for COVID-19, then we would expect
#fp (t) = (601, 220 − 8) × (1 − 90%) = 60, 121.2
and
#fn (t) = 8 × (1 − 60%) = 3.2.
That is, three infected person would be missed, and 60,121 healthy people (i.e., near 10% of
the population in Waterloo Region) would be misdiagnosed as infected with COVID-19. This
clearly demonstrates the blunder of testing everyone in a sizable population for COVID-19
without discretion.

Example 2: This example examines an opposite situation where the population is defined
to be a cohort of a small size. In the period of March 11-16, 2020, among those in-person
assessments and virtual visits in the clinic of Dr. Yu (the last co-author), 18 patients had
flu-like symptoms and they all expressed interest to be tested for COVID-19.

Assume that this small cohort has the same prevalence as that of the Waterloo Region.
If all those patients were to be tested for COVID-19, we would then expect
#fp (t) = 18 × (1 − 0.00099797%) × (1 − 90%) = 1.78
and
#fn (t) = 18 × 0.00099797% × (1 − 60%) ≈ 0,
where t represents the short time interval March 11-16, 2020. That is, almost no infected
patients would be mis-identified but about 1 or 2 healthy people would be misdiagnosed as
infected cases, if all 18 patients are tested for COVID-19 without being screened.

In fact, for those 18 patients with flu-like symptoms, only one patient was offered testing
based on the public health definition of PUI. If we perceive that this cohort should have a

10

higher prevalence than that of the general population in the Waterloo Region and assume
that P (t) = 1/18, then we would expect
#fp (t) = 18 × (1 − 1/18) × (1 − 90%) = 1.70
and
#fn (t) = 18 × (1/18) × (1 − 60%) = 0.4
if everyone in this cohort would be tested for COVID-19.

Am I Infected with COVID-19 if I have a Positive
Result after Several Consecutive Negative Results?

Since no medical tests can produce 100% accurate results, both false negative and false
positive results are possible when testing suspected patients. We are interested in whether
repeating the test can help improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. In particular, we evaluate
the chance that a tested subject is an infected case, given that the first (k − 1) consecutive
tests are negative but the kth test is positive, where k ≥ 1. We hope to study whether it is
necessary to continuously repeat the test, if consecutive negative results have been obtained
after certain repetitions. When should we stop testing in order to not miss infected cases?

To this end, let Yk∗ represent the kth test result of applying the test to an individual, where k is a positive integer. This binary random variable has the same distribution as that of Y . We want to find the value of k so that the conditional probability
∗
P (Y = 1|Y1∗ = 0, . . . , Yk−1
= 0, Yk∗ = 1) is smaller than a tolerance value, where k = 1, 2, . . ..

To find how the performance of the test comes into play, we express the conditional
∗
probability P (Y = 1|Y1∗ = 0, . . . , Yk−1
= 0, Yk∗ = 1) using the sensitivity and specificity of

the test as well as the prevalence. Assuming that the test is independently applied to an

11

individual k times, Using the Bayesian theorem gives that

P (Y = 1|Y1∗ = 0, . . . , Yk−1

For any test with the specificity higher than the false negative rate, (2) shows that a
larger value k suggests a smaller chance for an individual to be infected if the first positive
test result appears at the kth test, no matter what the sensitivity of the test and the population prevalence are. However, for a smaller number of k, the sensitivity of the test and
the population prevalence do matter for quantifying the probability.

In Figure 3, we report the conditional probability P (Y = 1|Y1∗ = 0, . . . , Yk−1

versus the sensitivity and specificity of the test for populations with different prevalence. In
the top panel of Figure 3, we display the results for k = 1. As long as the test has a high
specificity, applying the test to an individual from the population with a high prevalence can
be very informative. If the test result is positive, then it is highly likely that this individual
is infected with the disease; this is true, even if the test does not have a high sensitivity.
However, for a population with a low prevalence (e.g., 1%), even if the test has both a high
specificity and sensitivity, the probability of correctly confirming an infected case is very low
if the test is applied only once. This finding further suggests that it is unwise to apply a test
to everyone from the population with a low prevalence. It is advised that prior measures
should be taken to identify a suspected subpopulation (or a group of presumptive cases) so
that the resulting prevalence becomes high. Then applying the test to individuals in this
subpopulation can increase accuracy to identify infected cases.

12

The bottom panel of Figure 3 shows the results for k = 3. For a test with a low sensitivity, there is a high chance that a patient is infected even when the first positive result
appears at the third test, if we test individuals from the population with a high prevalence
(such as 85%). However, if the population has a small prevalence (such as 1%), it is unlikely
that the patient with the first positive result occurring at the third try is infected.

Recommendation 3: With a given test, when interpreting a positive result after consecutive negative results, caution should be taken for patients coming from different cohorts with
different prevalence.

Figure 3: The conditional probability for confirming a case by repeating the test k times versus
the sensitivity and specificity of the test: k = 1, 3 and the prevalence P (t) = 0.1, 0.25, 0.85;
The color shows the magnitude of the probability.

To further visualize how the cohort prevalence affects the probability of identifying an
infected case, given consecutive negative results followed by a positive result, we examine
the COVID-19 test described by Hutchison (2020) as opposed to the COVID-19 IgM/IgG
13

Rapid Test, a test newly released by the ISO13485 registered company BioMedomics. On
March 8, 2020, the company announced that it has received CE Mark-IVD certification for
its new test to help diagnose novel COVID-19. This test, available only for research use
at this stage, takes 15 minutes to obtain the result and can be used for rapid screening of
COVID-19 carriers who are symptomatic or asymptomatic. The sensitivity and specificity
of the test were estimated to be 88.66% and 90.63%, respectively, based on the test results
for 525 infected cases and 128 non-SARS-CoV-2 infection patients (BioMedomics 2020).

We graph the results in Figure 4. There is a high chance that the tested person contracts
COVID-19 if the result of applying the COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test is positive at the
first test, unless the population prevalence is very small; the chance is higher for testing
patients coming from a cohort with a higher prevalence. For the COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid
Test, if the positive result occurs only at the 4th test, then the chance of the tested subject
is infected is very slim unless the patient comes from a cohort with a high prevalence (such
as 60% or higher); if the first positive result occurs at the 6th test, the chance of the tested
subject is infected is almost 0 no matter which cohort this patient comes from. However,
for the COVID-19 test described by Hutchison (2020), even the first five test results are
negative, there is still a good chance that the tested subject is infected with COVID-19.

Recommendation 4: With the same cohort of patients, different interpretations should be
given for the positive result after the same number of consecutive negative results that are
obtained from different tests with different sensitivities and specificities.

Can I Get COVID-19 Twice?

As of March 13, 2020, in mainland China, there have been more than 100 reported cases
of cured patients released from hospitals, who later tested positive for COVID-19 a second
time. In China’s Guangdong province, 14% of people who recovered in the province were
later retested to be positive. Similar cases have been reported in Japan and South Korea
(Guzman 2020). This prompts the question “Can I get COVID-19 twice?” Put in other
words, we want to know whether we can differentiate the two scenarios: (1) patients who
contracted COVID-19 again after they were cured, and (2) patients who have never really
been cured and their discharge was due to the false negative test results.

Researchers perceive that reinfection is an unlikely explanation for patients who test
positive a second time. Testing errors and releasing patients from hospitals prematurely
15

are very likely the reason for reports of patients who retest positive. Although it has not
been proved that people who have contracted COVID-19 are immune, this is very likely the
case, as noted by Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Disease (Guzman 2020).

To assess this perception, we evaluate the chance of incorrectly claiming a COVID-19
carrier to be cured after obtaining several consecutive negative results. We are interested in
∗
= 0, Yk∗ = 0) for k = 1, 2, . . ..
assessing the conditional probability P (Y = 1|Y1∗ = 0, . . . , Yk−1

Assuming that the test is independently applied to a patient k times, then using the Bayesian
theorem, we obtain that
∗
P (Y = 1|Y1∗ = 0, . . . , Yk−1
= 0, Yk∗ = 0)
∗
= 0, Yk∗ = 0|Y = 1)P (Y = 1)
P (Y1∗ = 0, . . . , Yk−1

=

(1 − psen )k P (t)
(1 − psen )k P (t) + pkspe {1 − P (t)}

(3)

for k = 1, 2, . . ..

In Figure 5, for populations with different prevalence, 3-dimensional graphs were made to
show how the conditional probability for missing an infected case with k consecutive negative
results may depend on the sensitivity and specificity of the test, where k = 1, 3. It is clearly
seen that if the test has a low sensitivity, the chance of missing an infected case is high if the
test is done only once for populations with a large prevalence, even if the specificity of the
test is high; the larger the prevalence, the higher the chance of missing. For a test with a reasonably large sensitivity, the more we test, the smaller the chance of missing an infected case.

More rigorously, we rewrite the conditional probability (3) as
∗
= 0, Yk∗ = 0) =
P (Y = 1|Y1∗ = 0, . . . , Yk−1

which is satisfied by a test with the sensitivity larger than the false positive rate (i.e., 1−pspe )
or the specificity higher than the false negative rate (i.e., 1 − psen ). This condition must be
met by any test in use, otherwise, there is no point of using a test that is even worse than a
random guess. Hence, for any test in use, increasing the test number reduces the chance of
mistakenly discharging infected patients.

Recommendation 5: To reduce the chance of missing a COVID-19 carrier based on negative test results, it is important to increase the number of tests.

Figure 5: The chance of missing a case with k consecutive negative results versus the sensitivity and specificity of the test: k = 1, 3 and the prevalence P (t) = 0.01, 0.25, 0.85; The
color shows the magnitude of the chance.

To see how doctors may implement this recommendation when they need to discharge
inpatients with COVID-19-like symptoms, we compare the COVID-19 test described by
Hutchison (2020) to the COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test. Figure 6 displays how the probability of missing an infected case after receiving k consecutive negative test results depends
17

on the population prevalence of COVID-19 for k = 1, 2, . . . , 6. With the COVID-19 IgM/IgG
Rapid Test, having two consecutive negative test results ensures a nearly zero chance of missing infected cases if testing patients admitted to the ward with less than 50% COVID-19
carriers; for the inpatient ward with about 80% COVID-19 carriers, obtaining 3 consecutive
negative test results warrants a slim chance of missing infected cases; receiving 4 consecutive
negative results is enough for discharging any inpatients.

In comparison, the COVID-19 test described by Hutchison (2020) has about 20% smaller
sensitivity than the COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test. It requires more consecutive negative
results than the COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test for retaining a slim chance of missing infected cases, and different numbers of consecutive negative results produced by this test yield
more different probabilities of missing infected cases than those obtained from the COVID19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test. This comparison also illustrates how a high sensitivity of a test
can make a difference in reducing the chance of missing infected cases based on consecutive
negative results.

Recommendation 6: Different numbers of consecutive negative test results are required
to discharge inpatients admitted to wards with different prevalence. For the COVID-19 test
described by Hutchison (2020), to ensure the chance of mis-discharging to be smaller than
5%, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 consecutive negative test results are needed to discharge inpatients in a
ward with the prevalence about 20%, 40%, 50%, 70%, and 80%, respectively.

Analysis of Diamond Princess Data

To illustrate our discussion, we analyze the data of the Diamond Princess cruise for the
period of January 19, 2020 (the day before patient zero embarked on the cruise) to February
20, 2020 when all passengers were disembarked (Princess 2020). Diamond Princess was on
a 14-day round trip itinerary, departing from Yokohama in Tokyo on January 20, 2020 and
returning on February 4, 2020. There were 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew on board. Patient
zero traveled for five days on Diamond Princess and disembarked in Hong Kong on January
25. During those five days, patient zero did not report being ill; he was tested positive for
COVID-19 on February 1, six days after leaving the ship.

On February 4, 10 people were tested positive for COVID-19 among the first batch of
tested passengers. In subsequent days, more guests were tested positive. People with positive
19

test results were transported to local hospitals for medical care. Table 1 displays the number
of people whose test results were positive on different days. Using the notation in Section
2, January 19 is taken at t = 0 on which N (0) = Nh (0) = 3711 and Ns (0) = 0; January
20 is taken as t = 1 on which N (1) = N (0) and Ns (1) = 1; on February 4 (i.e., t = 17),
Ns (17) = 10 and N (17) = N (0) − 10. The left panel of Figure 8 displays the day-dependent
prevalence, and in the middle panel we report the changing population size using the red
curve.

Without discretion, we would use the COVID-19 test described by Hutchison (2020) to
test all passengers every day starting t = 17, then the daily numbers of false positive and
negative results can be worked out by (1). We visually display those numbers in the middle
panel (blue dashed curve) and the right panel in Figure 7. Clearly, when P (t) is very small,
#f p (t) is close to N (t) and #f n (t) is near 0; when P (t) becomes larger, #f p (t) becomes
smaller but #f n (t) gets larger.

Though having a large value of #f p (t) would not exacerbate the virus spread, it would
waste limited medical resources. Having a nonzero value of #f n (t) would be harmful because those undetected infected cases would be spreaders of the virus; on the day t = 30
of disembarking all the passengers, there could be 300 missed COVID-19 carriers if we test
everyone on the ship without carefully screening.

It is sensible to focus on testing suspected patients to reach a balance between the use
of limited medical resources and the result accuracy. By (2), the COVID-19 test should be
repeated at least three times for a suspected patient, and all three negative results would
ensure the chance of missing an infected case to be under 5%.

Conclusion and Discussion

In this article we take the statistical standpoint and examine several aspects of COVID-19
testing. We evaluate the uncertainty induced from the imperfectness of COVID-19 tests and
make recommendations. In summary, we highlight the following points:

1. Testing everyone without discretion is not recommended. A large number of false negatives is typical for medical tests with a low sensitivity. A large number of false positives
is produced from a test with a lower specificity. It is not feasible to test everyone who
shows flu-like symptoms. It is important to prioritize the testing of people who need
it the most, not only for the economical considerations of the availability of test kits,
21

but also for the statistical concerns of controlling false positive or negative results.

Even with enough test kits for the entire population, it is advised to identify suitable
candidates for the test. It is unwise to test everyone in the population without careful
discretion. Medical personnel generally believe that people in the following groups
should be prioritized to test for COVID-19 (Ferran 2020): (1) those at high risk such
as health care workers who have been in contact with COVID-19 patients, (2) symptomatic people in areas with high infection rates, (3) people 65 years of age and older
with chronic health issues, such as heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, and (4)
patients who have immunodeficiency diseases.

2. The accuracy of the COVID-19 test described by Hutchison (2020) is not precisely
known. Based on the test performance in China and the performance of the influenza
tests, the test is estimated to correctly identify around 60% of the patients with the
disease and correctly identify 90% of the patients that are disease-free. The low sensitivity of the current tests for COVID -19 would yield a large number of false negative
if we test everyone in a cohort with a low prevalence. That is, a large number of people
having the virus would be misdiagnosed as healthy if we attempt to test the entire
cohort which has not been carefully scrutinized for COVID-19.

3. The tests should only be applied to presumptive people in order to control false positive
and false negative results. With limited resources, targeting the presumptive people
and applying the tests repeatedly is the best strategy to make sure the true COVID-19
carriers are not missed and discharged inpatients are truly virus-free.

Our discussion is carried out exchangeably at the population level and on the basis of
an individual. When interpreting the results, caution should be taken for this difference.
In the initial stage, COVID-19 was transmitted in an unrecognized way. Limited testing
capacity and strict testing criteria delayed the identification of COVID-19 carriers in many
22

countries (Sullivan 2020). Our discussion here is useful to help make prudent decisions from
the administrative standpoint to optimize the usage of limited resources of test kits, healthcare workers, and medical facilities. However, from the perspective of an individual thinking
“better safe than sorry”, one might argue that having a false positive result is tolerable but
a false negative is troublesome. From a physician’s viewpoint, missing an infected case can
be more detrimental than misdiagnosing a COVID-19-free patient as a carrier. Such an error
would cause a spread of virus and delay medical care for the COVID-19 infected patients.
This article provides the assessment as to how likely we may miss identifying COVID-19 carriers based on consecutive negative results and how many times we should test a suspected
COVID-19 patient to reduce the chance of errors. On equal footing, our discussion provides
the guidelines for discharging inpatients who are treated for COVID-19.

There are several limitations of our discussion. In the discussion of the Diamond Princess
Cruise Data in Section 6, we ignore the fact that the population size N (t) and the prevalence P (t) are error-contaminated. In our discussion, the dynamic number of COVID-19
carriers Ns (t) is taken as the confirmed cases for each day t. The true value of Ns (t) is,
however, highly likely to be larger than the reported number for day t since some infected
passengers were asymptomatic and thus were not being tested on day t for t = 17, 18, . . . , 34.

While we consider a dynamic framework in Section 2 to characterize the change in the
population size and the relationship between the number of infected people and the number
of healthy people, our discussion on the COVID-19 status for individuals focuses on a static
state to highlight the ideas. More specifically, time-dependent status Y (t), instead of Y ,
should be used to reflect the time-dependent status for individuals in the population on day
t. As our understanding of COVID-19 grows and more accurate test kits become available,
our development should be modified and the recommendations can be made by incorporating time windows to reflect influencing factors, including the evolving stage of COVID-19,
preventive measures done by the local administration and the government, and the changes
in the public social behavior for different periods.

23

Another notable issue is that our discussion merely investigates testing errors from the
statistical angle to quantify the randomness and uncertainty associated with the test inaccuracy. We have not explicitly accommodated in the development the characteristics of
patients, such as age, severity of COVID-19-like symptoms, health conditions, and the medical history. This is caused by the lack of information on the sensitivity and specificity of
available test kits estimated from different cohorts of patients with varying medical conditions. As a last recommendation, we suggest that rather than reporting an overall sensitivity
and specificity for a developed test, developers of COVID-19 tests should evaluate a sequence
of the sensitivities and specificities of the test applicable to different cohorts of patients. This
will allow physicians and medical personnel to make more precise decisions to accommodate
the personalized-features of the patients.

Recommendation 7: Instead of being assessed by an overall sensitivity and specificity, the
performance of COVID-19 tests should be evaluated in a more refined measure by reporting their sensitivities and specificities obtained from the stratified population by the patient’s
medical conditions.

In the article, we compare two COVID-19 tests, the COVID-19 test described by Hutchison (2020) and the COVID-19 IgM-IgG Rapid Test. While the calculations show that the
COVID-19 IgM-IgG Rapid Test outperforms the COVID-19 test described by Hutchison
(2020), we are not ready to recommend to replace the latter test by the former one. While
the sensitivity and specificity of the COVID-19 IgM-IgG Rapid Test are higher than those
of the COVID-19 test described by Hutchison (2020), these results are obtained from different groups of patients whose conditions may differ considerably and the sizes may not be
comparable either.

Having fast and effective test tools is crucial for controlling the rapidly evolving COVID19 course while emerging research results offer new ways for testing COVID-19. For instance,
investigating the temporal changes of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT scans, Shi et al. (2020)
found that a CT could be a useful tool to detect COVID-19 pneumonia, even for asymp24

tomatic individuals. Their findings suggested that CT scans can be considered as a screening
tool together with RT-PCR for patients who traveled recently or have had close contact with
an infected individual. Furthermore, CT scans may be an important screening tool in the
small proportion of patients who have false-negative RT-PCR results (Lee, Ng and Khong
2020). Announced on March 21, 2020, diagnostics company Cepheid received emergency
authorization from the U.S. FDA to use its rapid molecular test, SAR-CoV-2 Xpert Xpress,
that can detect COVID-19 in 45 minutes for point-of-care patients (Scipioni 2020). A review
of the current laboratory methods available for testing COVID-19 was given by Loeffelholz
and Tang (2020).

Our discussion here considers repetitions of the same test procedures. With multiple
test kits becoming available, we face the decision of choosing suitable test kits to reach a
balance among several key factors. This includes but not limited to the time of acquiring
results, the associated cost, the test accuracy, and the suitability for patients with different
conditions. It is useful to ponder the question: How do we use them effectively? We may
apply a fast but less accurate test kit to do screening, and then apply a more accurate but
time-consuming and costly test to do further checks. If repeated tests need to be done, we
need to decide the number of the tests in order to not miss the infected patients. In addition,
in our discussion of repeating the test for COVID-19, we have not looked into the issue of
the gap time between two consecutive tests.
