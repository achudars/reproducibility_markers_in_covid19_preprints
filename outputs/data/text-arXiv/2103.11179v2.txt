Abstract—Although modeling studies are focused on the control of SIR-based systems describing epidemic data sets (particularly the COVID-19), few of them present a formal dynamic
characterization in terms of equilibrium sets and stability. Such
concepts can be crucial to understand not only how the virus
spreads in a population, but also how to tailor government
interventions such as social distancing, isolation measures, etc.
The objective of this work is to provide a full dynamic characterization of SIR-type systems under single-interval control actions
and, based on it, to find the control action that produces the
smallest number of infected individuals at the end of the epidemic
that avoids second wave outbreaks. Simulations illustrate the
benefits of the aforementioned results in terms of the herd
immunity threshold.

I. I NTRODUCTION
SIR-type models are based on the seminal work of [1],
which firstly established a compartmental relationship between
the main variables of an epidemic: Susceptible, Infected
and Removed individuals. After that, several extensions and
modifications have been proposed in the literature to account
for different epidemic characteristics. Surprisingly, even when
significant improvements have been made in the general understanding of the SIR dynamics, the core of almost any epidemic
behavior is still qualitatively described by the relatively simple
original 3-state model. With the outbreak of the novel COVID19 (produced by the SARS-CoV-2) at the end of 2019, a
plethora of studies have been developed to explain how the
virus spread around the world [2]. All of them, with more
or less complexity, bases their forecast, analysis and control
strategies on SIR-type models.
In [3], [4] a formal analysis was made concerning the
general behaviour of SIR-type models and the limit values (for
time going to infinity) of the state variables were characterized
for several scenarios and initial conditions corresponding to the
outbreak of the epidemic. In [5] an exact explicit solution for
SIR model was given, which allowed the scientific community
to go further with a more detailed dynamical analysis. Later
on, [6], [7] made further analysis concerning the effect of
a time varying coefficient with control purposes. SIR-type
models are not only useful to understand epidemic behaviors
but also (and more important) to asses the ways one can
control them according to a priori specified objectives. The

qualitative (an previous) evaluation of the different scenarios corresponding to different government measures (social
distancing, lockdown, use of face mask, hygiene recommendation, vaccination, etc.) represents a helpful tools for the
authorities decision-making in emergency times. At this point,
dynamical and control system theory [8] becomes crucial to
exploit formal mathematical analysis to account for optimal
control actions.
The SIDARTHE (Susceptible, Diagnosed, Ailing,
Recognized, Threatened, Healed, Extinct) model by
[2] was presented to describe the COVID-19 spread
in Italy, which provides a detailed description of
symptomatic/asymptomatic/isolation/detected state of the
individuals, even when the general dynamical behavior is the
same of SIR-type models: it shows a critical or threshold value
that cannot be surpassed by the final value of the susceptible
individuals. In [9]–[11] a rigorous analysis is made of simple
social distancing control actions (mainly, the ubiquitous single
interval social distancing). By means of different techniques,
the authors of these previous works showed how to find the
optimal single interval control action, to minimize the infected
peak prevalence (maximal fraction of infected individuals). A
similar approach concerning single interval interventions is
presented in [12], [13], but to minimize the epidemic final size
(or total fraction infected). Most of these proposal consider
the rather unrealistic scenario of possible full lockdown,
where the transmission rate is zero. Furthermore, in [14] it is
proposed a robust non linear model predictive control (MPC)
based on the SIDARTHE model introduced in [2]. The MPC
controller manipulates - as usual - the transmission rate
(which directly affects the reproduction number), given in this
case by several parameters. The objectives are to minimize
both, the number of fatalities and the time of isolation,
compared to a baseline policy. In [15] an MPC is proposed,
based on SIRD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead) and
SIRASD
(Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-AsymptomaticSymptomatic-Dead) models. A first-order differential
equation is used to describe the social distancing, which
is a binary signal (on-off, depending on weather the social
distancing is or not implemented) affecting the transmission
rate. The control objective consists in minimizing both,
the current number of infected individuals and the time of
isolation. Other similar approaches concerning MPC strategies
can be found in [16]–[18].
The objective of this manuscript is to present a pure
dynamical-system perspective to formally analyze SIR-type
models and their variants/extensions. The difference between
convergence, ǫ − δ (Lyapunov) stability and asymptotic stability of the equilibria is established, showing that this kind
of analysis is crucial to properly understand the whole system

behaviour and the control actions that can be implemented to
obtain an optimal closed-loop performance. The key goal of
this articles is to solve the following problem:
Problem 1: Instead of considering the control objective of
minimizing the peak of infected individuals and/or the number
of deaths, we consider (as a previous step) to maximize the
final number susceptible individuals that could avoid second
wave outbreaks - which means to minimize the total number
of infected individuals in the epidemic.
The solution of this problem constitutes an important baseline to go further in the design of complex control actions
aiming to find the social distancing sequence that also minimizes the infected peak and number of deaths, together with
the time the measures last.

0 < ǫ ≪ 1, i.e., the fraction of susceptible individuals is
smaller than, but close to 1; the fraction of infected is close
to zero and the fraction of removed are null.
The solution of (2) - which was analytically determined in
[5], for τ ≥ τ0 > 0, depends on R and the initial conditions
(S(τ0 ), I(τ0 ), C(τ0 )) ∈ X . Since S(τ ) ≥ 0, I(τ ) ≥ 0, for τ ≥
τ0 > 0, then S(τ ) is a decreasing function of τ (by 2.a) and
C(τ ) is an increasing function of τ , for all τ ≥ τ0 . From (2).b,
˙ ) = (RS(τ ) − 1)I(τ ) ≤ 0
it follows that if S(τ0 )R ≤ 1, I(τ
at τ0 . Furthermore, given that S(τ ) is decreasing, I(τ ) is also
decreasing for all τ ≥ τ0 . On the other hand, if S(τ0 )R > 1,
I(τ ) initially increases, then reaches a global maximum, and
ˆ
finally decreases to zero. In this latter case, the peak of I, I,
is reached at τ̂ , when I˙ = RSI − I = 0. This implies that
S = S ∗ , where
S ∗ := min{1, 1/R}

This section describes the SIR mathematical model - in its
different forms ( [1], [3], [4]) - from a dynamical system point
of view. Consider a population of N individuals in a closed
geographical region. The continuous-time dynamical system
describing the epidemic is given by the following differential
equations
Ṡ(t) = −βS(t)I(t)
˙ = βS(t)I(t) − γI(t)
I(t)

(1b)

Ċ(t) = γI(t),

(1c)

(1a)

where S(t) is the fractions of individuals who are susceptible
to contract the infection at time t, I(t) is the fractions
of infected/infective individuals (that cause other individuals
to become infected) at time t, and C(t) is the cumulative
fractions of removed individuals (who have already recovered
from the disease, or deceased because of it, up to time
t). Parameters β and γ stand for the transmission and the
recovery/death rates of the disease, respectively.
Remark 1: Each of the latter compartments (S, I and C)
can be divided into a number of sub-compartments, potentially
connected to each others, to have a more detailed description
of an epidemic [2]. However, the main dynamic of the original
system is, in general, maintained, as detailed in [9].
A non-dimensional version of model (1) can be obtained by
rescaling the time by τ := tγ ( [4], [7]). This way, model (1)
reads:

where R = β/γ is the so-called basic reproduction number.
To emphasize the fact that all the variable are positive, let us
define the following constraint set
X:={(S, I, C) ∈ R3: S ∈ [0, 1],I ∈ [0, 1],C ∈ [0, 1]},
in such a way that (S(τ ), I(τ ), C(τ )) ∈ X for all τ ≥ 0.
˙ ) + Ċ(τ ) = 0, so S(τ ) +
Furthermore, note that Ṡ(τ ) + I(τ
I(τ )+R(τ ) = 1, for τ ≥ 0. Particularly, S(0)+I(0)+R(0) =
1, where τ = 0 is assumed to be the epidemic outbreak time,
in such a way that (S(0), I(0), R(0)) := (1 − ǫ, ǫ, 0), with

is a threshold or critical value, known as ”herd immunity”.
This way, conditions S(τ0 )R > 1 and S(τ0 )R < 1 that
determines if I(τ ) increases or decreases at τ0 can be
rewritten as S(τ0 ) > S ∗ and S(τ0 ) < S ∗ , respectively.
For the sake of simplicity, we define S∞ := limτ →∞ S(τ ),
I∞ := limτ →∞ I(τ ) and C∞ := limτ →∞ c(τ ), which are
values that depend on initial conditions S(τ0 ), I(τ0 ), C(τ0 ),
and R. By taking τ → ∞ for the solutions proposed in [5],
we obtain I∞ = 0, and, so, C∞ = 1 − S∞ . Furthermore, S∞
fulfills the condition1:
S(τ0 )eRC(τ0 ) e−R(1−S∞ ) = S∞ ,
which, considering that S(τ0 ) + I(τ0 ) + C(τ0 ) = 1, can be
simplified to
S(τ0 )e−R(S(τ0 )+I(τ0 )) = S∞ e−RS∞ .

CHARACTERIZATION AND STABILITY

The equilibrium of system (2) is obtained by zeroing each of
the differential equations. This way the equilibrium set is given
¯ C̄) ∈ R3 : S̄ ∈ [0, 1], I¯ = 0, C̄ = 1 − S̄}.
by Xs := {(S̄, I,
For initial conditions (S(τ0 ), I(τ0 ), C(τ0 )) ∈ X , the latter set
can be refined as
¯ C̄) ∈ R3: S̄ ∈ [0, S(τ0 )], I=0,
¯
Xs:={(S̄, I,
C̄=1−S̄},
since S is decreasing. Next, a key theorem concerning the
asymptotic stability of a subset of Xs is introduced.
Theorem 1 (Asymptotic Stability): Consider system (2) constrained by X . Then, the set
¯ C̄) ∈ R3: S̄ ∈ [0, S ∗ ], I=0,
¯
Xsst:={(S̄, I,
C̄=1−S̄},
where S ∗ is the herd immunity defined as S ∗ := min{1, 1/R},
is the unique symptotically stable (AS) of system (2), with a
domain of attraction (DOA) given by X .
Proof: The proof is divided into two parts. First it is shown
that Xsst is the smallest attractive equilibrium set in X . Then, it
is shown that Xsst is the largest locally ǫ−δ stable equilibrium
1 Note that the equation S
−R(1−S∞ ) - given in [3], [6] - is
∞ = S(τ0 )e
only valid when C(τ0 ) = 0.

subsets of Xsst are attractive in X , which shows that Xsst is
the smallest attractive set in X (see Figure 2 for a schematic
plot of the behavior of single states in Xsst ).
Local ǫ−δ stability: Let us consider a particular equilibrium
point x̄ := (S̄, 0, C̄), with S̄ ∈ [0, S ∗ ] and C̄ = 1 − S̄ (i.e.,
x̄ ∈ Xsst ). Then a Lyapunov function candidate is given by (a
modified version of the one used in [19])
S

V (x) := S − S̄ − S̄ ln( ) + I.
S̄
This function is continuous in X , is positive definite for all
non-negative x 6= x̄ and, furthermore, V (x̄) = 0. Function V
evaluated at the solutions of system (2) reads:

set in X which, together with the previous results, implies that
Xsst is the unique symptotically stable (AS) of system (2), with
a domain of attraction (DOA) given by X .
Attractivity: By manipulating equation (4), we have
−RS(τ0 )e−R(S(τ0 )+I(τ0 )) = −RS∞ e−RS∞ .

−R(S(τ0 )+I(τ0 ))

Denote y := −RS∞ and z := −RS(τ0 )e
.
Then, equation (5) can be written as z = yey . Then
W (z) = y, where W (·) is the Lambert function. That is,
W (−RS(τ0 )e−R(S(τ0 )+I(τ0 )) ) = −RS∞ , or
W (−RS(τ0 )e−R(S(τ0 )+I(τ0 )) )
. (6)
R
Since W (z) is an increasing function (it goes from −1
at z = −1/e to 0 at z = 0), it reaches its minimum at
z=−1/e. z(S(τ0 ), I(τ0 ))=−RS(τ0 )e−R(S(τ0 )+I(τ0 )) reaches
its maximum when S(τ0 ) = S ∗ , independently of the values
of R and I(τ0 ) (see Lemmas 1 in the Appendix 2), in which
case it is z(S(τ0 ), I(τ0 ))=1/e. Then, W (z) is bounded from
above by −1, which means that S ∗ is an upper bound for S∞ .
Therefore, S∞ ∈ [0, S ∗ ], which shows the attractivity of Xsst .
Figures 1 shows a plot of S∞ as a function of S(τ0 ) and
I(τ0 ) for a fixed value of R > 1 (a similar plot can be obtained
for R < 1, in which S∞ reaches its maximum at the vertex of
the domain, S(τ0 )=1 and I(τ0 )=0).
To show that Xsst is the smallest attractive set in X ,
¯ C̄) := x̄ ∈ Xsst and an arbitrary
consider a state (S̄, I,
small ball of radius ǫ > 0, w.r.t. X , around it, Bǫ (x̄) ∈ X .
Pick two arbitrary initial states x0,1 = (S0,1 , I0,1 , C0,1 ) and
x0,2 = (S0,2 , I0,2 , C0,2 ) in Bǫ (x̄), such that S0,1 6= S0,2
and C0,1 6= C0,2 . These two states converge, according to
equation (6), to x∞,1 = (S∞,1 , 0, 1 − S∞,1 ) and x∞,2 =
(S∞,2 , 0, 1 − S∞,2 ), respectively, with S∞,1 , S∞,2 ∈ [0, S ∗ ].
Given that function z(S(τ0 ), I(τ0 )) is monotone (injective) in
S(τ0 ) and I(τ0 ), and W (z) is monotone (injective) in z, then
S∞,1 6= S∞,2 . This means that, although both initial states
converge to some state in Xsst , they necessarily converge to
different points. Therefore neither single states x̄ ∈ Xsst nor

for x(0) ∈ X and τ ≥ 0. Function V̇ (x(τ )) depends on
x(τ ) only through I(τ ). So, independently of the value of
the parameter S̄, V̇ (x(τ )) = 0 for I(τ ) ≡ 0. This means that
for any single x(0) ∈ Xs , I(0) = 0 and so, I(τ ) = 0, for all
τ ≥ 0. So V̇ (x(τ )) is null for any x(0) ∈ Xs (i.e, it is not
only null for x(0) = x̄ but for any x(0) ∈ Xs ).
On the other hand, for x(0) ∈
/ Xs , function V̇ (x(t)) is
negative, zero or positive, depending on if the parameter S̄ is
smaller, equal or greater than S ∗ = min{1, 1/R}, respectively,
and this holds for all x(0) ∈ X and τ ≥ 0. So, for any x̄ ∈
Xsst , V̇ (x(τ )) ≤ 0 (particularly, for x̄ = (S̄, 0, 0) = (S ∗ , 0, 0),
V̇ (x(τ )) = 0, for all x(0) ∈ X and τ ≥ 0) which means
that each x̄ ∈ Xsst is locally ǫ − δ stable (see Theorem 4 in
Appendix 1). Then, if every state in Xsst is locally ǫ−δ stable,
the whole set Xsst is locally ǫ − δ stable.
Finally, by following similar steps, it can be shown that
Xsun is not ǫ − δ stable, which implies that Xsst is also the
largest locally ǫ − δ stable set in X , which completes the
proof. 
Remark 2: In the latter proof, if we pick a particular
x̄ ∈ Xsst , then V̇ (x(t)) is not only null for x(0) = x̄ but for
all x(0) ∈ Xsst , since in this case, I(τ ) = 0, for τ ≥ 0. This
means that it is not true that V̇ (x(t)) < 0 for every x 6= x̄,
and this is the reason why single equilibrium points (and
subsets of Xsst ) are ǫ − δ stable, but not attractive.
Two corollaries of Theorem 1, concerning the properties of
Xsst and the general behavior of S∞ , are presented next.
Corollary 1: Consider system (2) with arbitrary initial
conditions (S(τ0 ), I(τ0 ), C(τ0 )) ∈ X , for some τ0 ≥ 0. Then:
(i) Set Xsst is in general a subset of Xs (for R < 1, Xsst ≡ Xs ),
and its size depends on R, but not on the initial conditions.
(ii) Subsets of Xsst are ǫ − δ stable but not attractive (i.e.,
even when Xsst is AS as a whole, no subset of it is AS). For

Fig. 2. Every point in Xsst is ǫ − δ stable but not attractive. Initial

states x0 starting arbitrarily close to x̄ ∈ Xsst remain (for all τ ≥ 0)
arbitrarily close to x̄, but do not converge to x̄. As a consequence,
set Xsst is AS but the points inside it are not.

such that S(τ0 )+I(τ0 )+C(τ0 ) = 1 (starting points in empty circles,
ending points in solid circles). Set Xsst is in green, while Xsun is in
red. As it can be seen, all the trajectories converges to Xsst . As R
decreases under 1, Xsst is the whole set Xs .

each single equilibrium state xs ∈ Xsst there always exists an
arbitrary small disturbance (in I) such that the state trajectory
converges to another state in Xsst . This is particularly true
for the state (S ∗ , 0, 0) which belongs to Xsst . (iii) If R < 1,
S ∗ = 1. Then, Xsst ≡ Xs and the so called healthy equilibrium
xh := (S̄, 0, 0) with S̄ = 1, is in Xsst , and so it is ǫ − δ stable,
but not attractive (any small value of I will make the system
to converge to (S̄, 0, 0)) with S̄ < 1. (iv) If R > 1, set Xs
can be divided into two sets, Xs = Xsst ∪ Xsun , where
¯ C̄) ∈ R3 : S̄ ∈ (S ∗ , 1], I¯ = 0, C̄ = 1 − S̄},
Xsun := {(S̄, I,
is an unstable equilibrium set (which contains the healthy
equilibrium). (v) Given that any compact set including an AS
equilibrium set is AS, Xs is AS, for any value of R. However,
if R > 1, it contains an unstable equilibrium set, Xsun .
Figures 3 shows a Phase Portrait for system (2), with R > 1,
and initial conditions such that S(τ0 ) + I(τ0 ) + C(τ0 ) = 1.
Similar behavior can be seen if R < 1, with Xsst ≡ Xs .

Corollary 2: Consider system (2) with arbitrary initial
conditions (S(τ0 ), I(τ0 ), C(τ0 )) ∈ X , for some τ0 ≥ 0. Then:
1) For any value of S(τ0 ) > 0 and I(τ0 ) > 0,
S∞ (R, S(τ0 ), I(τ0 )) → 0 , when R → ∞; while
S∞ (R, S(τ0 ), I(τ0 )) remains close to S(τ0 ) when R →
0.
2) For S(τ0 ) > S ∗ and fixed I(τ0 ) > 0 and R >
0, S∞ (R, S(τ0 ), I(τ0 )) decreases with S(τ0 ), and
S∞ (R, S(τ0 ), I(τ0 )) < S ∗ . This means that the closer
S(τ0 ) is to S ∗ from above, the closer will be S∞ to S ∗
from below.
3) For S(τ0 ) < S ∗ and fixed I(τ0 ) > 0 and R >
0, S∞ (R, S(τ0 ), I(τ0 )) increases with S(τ0 ), and
S∞ (R, S(τ0 ), I(τ0 )) < S ∗ . This means that the closer
S(τ0 ) is to S ∗ from below, the further will be S∞ to
S ∗ , from below.
4) For any fixed S(τ0 ) ∈ [0, 1] and R > 0,
S∞ (R, S(τ0 ), I(τ0 )) decrease with I(τ0 ), and
S∞ (R, S(τ0 ), I(τ0 )) ≤ S ∗ .
5) For fixed R > 0, S(τ0 ) = S ∗ and I(τ0 ) =
0, S∞ (R, S(τ0 ), I(τ0 )) reaches its maximum over
{(S, I) ∈ R2 : S ∈ [0, 1], I ∈ [0, 1]}, and the maximum
value is given by S ∗ (see Lemma 1 in Appendix 2).
The proof of the properties enumerated in Corollary 2 are
omitted for brevity. However, Figures 1 and 13 show how
S∞ behaves for different values of initial conditions. In the
next section the effect of control actions modifying R for
a finite period of time is studied. To simplify the analysis,
the following property, concerning quasi steady states, is
introduced:
Property 1 (Quasi steady state): Consider system (2) with
arbitrary initial conditions (S(τ0 ), I(τ0 ), C(τ0 )) ∈ X , for
some τ0 ≥ 0. Then, there is a large enough finite time,
τqss , such that for all τ ≥ τqss , both Ṡ(τ ) and I(τ ) can be
approximated by zero, and S(τ ) is approximately equal to
S∞ (R, S(τ0 ), I(τ0 )). This latter condition is known as Quasi
Steady State (QSS) and, opposite to the formal steady state
condition, is assumed to be reached in finite time.
Time τqss depends on the value of R, and can be computed
- for practical purposes - as τqss (R) = 5τ̂ (R), where τ̂ (R)
is peak time of I(τ ) corresponding to a given R.
IV. C ONTROL
Control objectives in epidemic can be defined in several
ways. The peak of the infected individual uses to be a critical
index to minimize, since it is directly related to the health
system capacity. However, other indexes - usually put in a
second place - are also important. This is the case of the time
the epidemic last, including second (or third) outbreak waves,
and the total number of infected individuals at the end of the
epidemic (measured by t he epidemic final size C∞ = 1−S∞ ).
Among many others, social distancing is a typical nonpharmaceutical measure that decrease parameter β in system
(1) or, directly, parameter R in system (2). We will consider
that R varies over time but it is piece-wise constant. More
precisely, we will assume a single interval social distancing
[9]–[13]. At the outbreak of the epidemic (τ = 0), it is

(S(0),I(0),C(0)) := (1−ǫ, ǫ, 0), with 0 < ǫ ≪ 1, and R(0) > 1
(R(0) goes from 2.5 to 3.5 for the SARS-CoV-2, all around the
world). Then, the single interval social distancing is defined
by the following function:

 R(0) for τ ∈ [0, τs ),
Rs
for τ ∈ [τs , τf ],
(9)
R(τ ) =

R(0) for τ ∈ (τf , ∞),

where τs < τ̂ (R(0)), being τ̂ (R(0)) the time of the peak
of I(τ ) when no social distancing is implemented, Rs ∈
[Rmin , R(0)], with Rmin ∈ (0, R(0)) (the case Rs = 0 is
not considered, since it represents a full lockdown which is
rather unrealistic) and τf > τs , but finite.
The control problem we want to solve reads as follows:
for given initial time, τs < τ̂ , find Rs and τf (finite) to
maximize S∞ = S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )). Note that minimize
S∞ corresponds to maximize C∞ = 1 − S∞ (since I∞ = 0),
which represents the minimal epidemic final size
A critical point concerning social distancing measures (that
is usually disregarded) is that they are always temporary
control actions (τf finite), not permanent ones (as clearly
stated in [9] and [14]). It is not possible to maintain efficient
social distancing actions for ever (neither for a time long
enough to make the virus to disappear) since population
fatigue due to psychological or economical problems would
systematically relax its effectiveness.
So, according to the stability results from the previous
sections, the following Theorem holds:
Theorem 2 (S steady state upper bound): Consider system
(2) with initial conditions (S(0), I(0), C(0)) = (1 − ǫ, ǫ, 0),
0 < ǫ ≪ 1, and R(0) such that S(0) > S ∗ . Any single
interval social distancing as the one defined in (9), with finite
final time, makes the system to converges to an equilibrium
state (S∞ , 0, C∞ ) with S∞ = S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) < S ∗ ,
being S ∗ < 1 the herd immunity corresponding to no social
distancing.
Proof: Under the assumption of a single interval social distancing, Theorem 1 states that S∞ is determined by the value
of R(τ ), for τ > τf , which is R(0), and by S(τf ), I(τf );
that is, S∞ = S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )). Furthermore, by
Lemma 1, this function reaches its unique maximum over
{(S, I) ∈ R2 : S ∈ [0, 1], I ∈ [0, 1]}, given by S ∗ , when
I(τf ) = 0 and S(τf ) = S ∗ . But I(τf ) > 0, given that τf is
finite (I(τ ) converges to zero asymptotically), which implies
that S∞ = S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) < S ∗ , and the proof is
complete. 
Remark 3: Note that even if Rs is time-varying in (9),
Theorem 2 is still true. This is a simple but strong result
concerning any kind of social distancing interrupted at finite
time. The minimal possible epidemic final size is completely
determined by the epidemic itself (its original R(0)) and,
provided that no immunization (by vaccination and/or development of the individuals immune system) is considered,
it cannot be modified by non-pharmaceutical measures. The
point to be elucidated now is which are the value of Rs and
the finite final time τf that minimize kS ∗ − S∞ k.
In the search of such a value, the next definition is stated.

Definition 1 (Goldilocks social distancing): The goldilocks
social distancing, Rg = Rg (τs ), is defined as the one that, if
applied at τs < τ̂ (R(0)), produces S∞ (Rg , S(τs ), I(τs )) =
S∗.
Remark 4 (Rg computation): Given τs and R(0), Rg =
g
R (S(τs ), I(τs )) = Rg (τs ) can be obtained, numerically, by
means of Algorithm 1. For 0 < τs < τ̂ and fixed R(0) > 1,
Rg (τs ) is a decreasing function of τs .
Algorithm 1: Computation of Rg (τs )
R = R(0);
Compute S(τs ) and I(τs ) by integrating system (2),
with R = R(0), from 0 to τs ;
S ∗ = 1/R;
S∞ (R, S(τs ), I(τs )) =
-lambertw(0, −RS(τs)e−R(S(τs )+I(τs )) )/R;
while S∞ <= S ∗ do
R ← R − 0.0001;
S∞ (R, S(τs ), I(τs )) ←
-lambertw(0, −RS(τs)e−R(S(τs )+I(τs )) )/R;
end
Rg = R;
Clearly, goldilocks social distancing cannot be applied indefinitely, since τf is finite. However, it can be applied up to a
time τf > τs + τqss (Rs ), in such a way that S(τf ) and I(τf )
arbitrarily approaches S ∗ and 0 (from above), respectively.
This way, the following definition can be introduced:
Definition 2 (Quasi optimal single interval social distancing): Consider a given starting time, τs ∈ (0, τ̂ (R(0))). Then,
the quasi optimal single interval control action consists in
applying Rg , up to a time τf > τs + τqss (Rs ), such that the
system reaches a QSS (i.e., S(τf ) ≈ S ∗ and I(τf ) ≈ 0).
Remark 5: Clearly, the latter definition refers to a quasi
optimal single interval control action, because larger values of
τf will produce values of S(τf ) and I(τf ) closer to S ∗ and 0,
respectively, so S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) will be closer to S ∗ .
Remark 6: If Rs is allowed to be zero (which, as it was
said, is a rather unrealistic case), another quasi optimal single
interval control action would be to apply Rs = 0 at τs = τ̂
(the time at which S(τ ) reaches S ∗ and I(τ ) reaches the peak),
and keep this control for a large enough time τf , such that the
system reaches a QSS (i.e., I(τf ) ≈ 0), as proposed in [12].
Remark 7: A question that naturally arises is what happen if,
for a given social distancing (quasi-optimal or not), τf cannot
be large enough for the system to reach a QSS. Clearly, in this
scenario, to implement the goldiclocks social distancing, Rg ,
may be counterproductive, and may produce a value of S∞
significantly smaller than S ∗ . However, the important point is
that all social distancing Rs implemented for a period of time
that not allow the system to reach a QSS before it is interrupted
will produce a value of S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) significantly
smaller than the one obtained with the quasi optimal single
interval control action.
The next Theorem, which is one of the main contribution
of the work, summarizes the latter results by means of a

classification that consider every possible single interval social
distancing case.
Theorem
3
(Single
interval
social
distancing
scenarios): Consider system (2) with initial conditions
(S(0), I(0), C(0)) = (1 − ǫ, ǫ, 0), 0 < ǫ ≪ 1, with R(0)
such that S(0) > S ∗ . Consider also single interval social
distancing (as the one defined in (9)), with a given starting
time τs ∈ (0, τ̂ (R(0))), and a finite final time τf . Define
soft and strong social distancing depending on if Rs > Rg
or Rs < Rg , respectively. Define also long and short term
social distancing depending on if the system reaches or
does not reach a QSS at τf (i.e., if τf > τs + τqss (Rs ) or
τf < τs + τqss (Rs )). Then, the following scenarios can take
place:
1) Quasi optimal single interval social distancing: if Rs =
Rg , and τf > τs + τqss (Rs ) (i.e., (S(τf ), I(τf ), C(τf ))
reaches a QSS), then S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) ≈ S ∗ .
Furthermore, the closer is S(τf ) to S ∗ (or I(τf ) to zero),
the closer will be S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) to S ∗ .
2) Soft
long
term
social
distancing:
if
(S(τf ), I(τf ), C(τf )) reaches a QSS, and S(τf ) < S ∗ ,
then S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) ≈ S(τf ) < S ∗ ; i.e.,
S(τ ) will remain approximately constant for τ ≥ τf .
Furthermore, the softer a soft long term social distancing
is, the smaller will be S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )).
3) Strong
long
term
social
distancing:
if
(S(τf ), I(τf ), C(τf )) reaches a QSS, and S(τf ) > S ∗ ,
a second outbreak wave will necessarily take place at
some time τ̂ˆ > τf and, finally, the system will converge
to an S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) < S ∗ . Furthermore, the
stronger a strong long term social distancing is, the
larger will be the second wave and the smaller will be
S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )).
4) Short term social distancing: if (S(τf ), I(τf ), C(τf ))
does not reach a QSS (i.e, if I(τf ) 6≈ 0), then soft, strong
and goldilocks social distancing will necessarily produce
values of S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) significantly smaller
than the one obtained by quasi optimal single interval
social distancing. In general, larger values of I(τf )
will produce smaller values of S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )).
This case includes the particular case where the social
distancing is interrupted at the very moment at which
S(τf ) = S ∗ , but with I(τf ) 6≈ 0. This means that the
herd immunity needs to be reached a steady state, not
as a transitory one.
Proof: The proof follows from the stability results shown in
Section III, and equation (6) defining S∞ :
1) Given that Rs = Rg is implemented for τ ∈
[τs , τf ], τf is finite but greater than τs + τqss (Rs ) and
S∞ (Rg , S(τs ), I(τs )) = S ∗ , then S(τf ) approaches
S ∗ and I(τf ) approaches zero, from above, as τf
increases. This means that at τf , when social distancing is interrupted, (S(τf ), I(τf ), C(τf )) is close to
the unstable equilibrium set Xsun . Then, by Corollary
2.(2), function S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) is such that the
closer (S(τf ), I(τf ), C(τf )) is to the equilibrium point
(S ∗ , 0, 1 − S ∗ ), with S(τf ) > S ∗ , the closer will be

S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) to S ∗ , with S∞ < S ∗ (see the
’pine’ shape of S∞ around S ∗ , for I ≈ 0, in Figure
13)2 .
2) Given that (S(τf ), I(τf ), C(τf )) approaches a steady
state with S(τf ) < S(τf ), then (S(τf ), I(τf ), C(τf )) is
close to the stable equilibrium set Xsst , when the social
distancing is interrupted. Then, the system will converge
to an equilibrium with S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) close to
S(τf ). Softer social distancing produces smaller values
of S(τf ) and, by Corollary 2.(3), smaller values of S(τf )
produce smaller values of S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )).
3) Given that (S(τf ), I(τf ), C(τf )) approaches a steady
state with S(τf ) > S ∗ , then (S(τf ), I(τf ), C(τf )) is
close to the unstable equilibrium set, X un , when the
social distancing is interrupted. Then, the system will
converges to an equilibrium in the stable equilibrium
set, X st , with S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) < S ∗ . Stronger
social distancing produces greater values of S(τf ) and,
by Corollary 2.(2), values of S(τf ) farther from S ∗ ,
from above, produce values of S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf ))
farther from S ∗ , from below. When S(τf ) is significantly greater than S ∗ , no matter how large is τf
and how small is I(τf )3 , the system will evolve to
an equilibrium in Xsst , with S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf ))
significantly smaller than S ∗ . Furthermore, to go from
S(τf ) to S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )), for τ > τf , the
system significantly increase I(τ ), and this effect is
known as a second outbreak wave.
4) Given that (S(τf ), I(τf ), C(τf )) is a transitory state,
then it does not approach any equilibrium. This means
that I(τf ) is significantly greater than 0, and according to Lemma 1, in Appendix 2, the maximum of
S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) over E(δ):= {(S(τf ), I(τf ))∈
R2 : S(τf ) ∈ [0, 1], I(τf ) ∈ [δ,1]} is given by
∗
−W (−RS ∗ e−R(S +δ) )/R, which a decreasing function of δ, and reaches S ∗ only when δ = 0 (see
Figure 13). Then, independently of the value of S(τf ),
S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) will be significantly smaller
than the one obtained with optimal single interval social
distancing, in which δ ≈ 0. 
A. Some remarks
(i) The quasi optimal single interval social distancing does
not account for the peak of the infected individuals, but
2 Indeed, by the ǫ − δ stability of the equilibrium state (S ∗ , 0, 1 − S ∗ ),
for each (arbitrary small) ǫ > 0, it there exists δ > 0, such that, if the
system starts in a ball of radius δ centered at (S ∗ , 0, 1 − S ∗ ), it will
keeps indeterminately in the ball of radius ǫ centered at (S ∗ , 0, 1 − S ∗ ).
Furthermore, it is possible to define invariant sets around (S ∗ , 0, 1 − S ∗ )
by considering the level sets of the Lyapunov function (7), with S̄ = S ∗ ,
or even the level sets of function V (S, I, C) := S ∗ − S∞ (R, S, I), with a
fixed R > 0. This way, once the system enters any arbitrary small level set
of the latter functions, it cannot leaves the set anymore. See, Figure 4
3 Note that as long as τ is finite, (S(τ ), I(τ ), C(τ )) cannot reach
f
f
f
f
Xsun , and so I(τf ), even when arbitrary small, is greater than zero. So,
once the social distancing is interrupted, the system evolves to an equilibrium
in Xsun . But even if we assume that for a large τf , (S(τf ), I(τf ), C(τf ))
reaches Xsun (the last infected individual is recovered), an infected individual
entering the population from outside, will destabilize the system in the same
way.

Fig. 4. Phase Portrait for system (2) in the S, I plane, with R =

2.5 different starting points (red lines), and level curves of function
V (S, I) := S ∗ −S∞ (R, S, I). Function V is positive for all (S, I) 6=
(S ∗ , 0), is null at (S ∗ , 0) and V̇ (S, I) = 0 along the solution of
system (2) (since S∞ (R, S, I) is). So its level sets are arbitrary small
invariant sets around (S ∗ , 0). Note that starting states close to (S ∗ , 0)
produce time evolution close to S ∗ .

only for the maximal final value of S that avoids further
outbreaks. Indeed, if a piece-wise constant R(τ ) is applied
for τ ∈ [τs , τf ] (instead of a single value) the peak of I can
be arbitrary selected to be under any threshold (defined, for
instance, by ICU system).
(ii) To apply soft control actions (even no-social-distancing
at all), expecting it would evolve alone to the herd immunity
value, is not an option. S∞ is in general significantly smaller
than S ∗ (specially for the reported values of R for the COVID19).
(iii) To apply intermediate social distancing up to the time
the system reaches the herd immunity, and then interrupt it, is
not an option. This strategy implies to reduce the reproduction
number not so drastically, in such a way that S underpasses S ∗
at some time. However, if the social distancing is interrupted
at a transient state (assuming Rs > 0), the initial conditions
for the next time period are such that S∞ will be significantly
smaller than S ∗ .
(iv) To apply hard social distancing measures, for an undefined
large period of time, expecting the epidemic will die out alone
is not an option. Hard social distancing produces an S(τf )
larger than S ∗ (no matter if Rs > 1 or Rs < 1), but this Sf is
an artificial steady state value, since once the social distancing
is dropped or reduced, a second infection wave will necessarily
occurs at some future time.
(v) The results presented in the previous sections are quite universal for all kind of SIR-type models describing the COVID19 epidemic. Indeed, as long as a reproduction number is
well defined and three groups of compartments are stated as in the SIDHARTE model presented in [2] - the stability
and optimality results are still valid.

interval social distancing Rs = Rg = 1.4157, interrupted after a
quasi steady state is reached. S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) = 0.3942,
which as predicted, is a value close to S ∗ = 0.4.

V. S IMULATION R ESULTS
To illustrate the results of the previous sections, some simulations are performed next. Consider system (2) with R = 2.5
(which corresponds to the herd immunity S ∗ = 0.4), and initial conditions(S(0), I(0), C(0)) = (0.9950, 0.0050, 0.0000).
Consider also a single interval social distancing starting at
τs = 2 (in adimensional units). Then, different values of
Rs (the social distancing reproduction number), and τf (final
single interval social distancing time) will be considered to
demonstrate the different cases described in Theorem 3.
A. Long term social distancing
Consider the case of single interval social distancing during
a large enough time for the system to reach a QSS before
it is interrupted. To ensure such a QSS condition, τf is
computed as 6 times the infected peack time corresponding
to quasi optimal single interval social distancing, i.e., τf =
6τ̂ (Rs ) = 6(3.6) = 21.6 (in adimensional units). First, the
quasi optimal single interval social distancing, which consists
in applying Rs = Rg = 1.4157 from τs to τf is simulated.
The results are shown in Figure 5, where it can be seen that
the social distancing is interrupted when S(τf ) is close to
S ∗ (from above) and, so, S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) ends up at
a value close to S ∗ , from below. Furthermore, in Figure 6,
the phase portrait of the simulation is shown, in the plane
S, I, together with the level curves of the Lyapunov functions
V (S, I) := S ∗ − S∞ (R, S, I), with R corresponding to both,
the open loop value R(0) and the social distancing value, Rs .
As it can be seen, the state goes along the open loop Lyapunov
level curves (in red) up to time τs , then switches to a trajectory
along the social distancing Lyapunov level curves (in green)
up to τf , to finally return to a trajectory along the open loop
Lyaponv level curves. This later trajectory cannot be seen in
this case, since at τf the system is very close to ǫ − δ stable
equilibrium (S ∗ , 0).
Next, a soft social distancing is considered, by applying
Rs = 1.8 from τs to τf . The results are shown in Figure 7,

significantly smaller than S ∗ = 0.4.
Fig. 7.

where it can be seen that the social distancing is interrupted
when S(τf ) is close to its QSS value, S∞ (Rs , S(τs ), I(τs )),
which is smaller than S ∗ . So, S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) ends
up at a value close to S∞ (Rs , S(τs ), I(τs )), which as it was
said, is significantly smaller than S ∗ . Furthermore, in Figure
8, the phase portrait of the simulation is shown, in the plane
S, I, together with the level curves of the Lyapunov functions
V (S, I) := S ∗ − S∞ (R, S, I), with R corresponding to both,
the open loop value R(0) and the social distancing value, Rs .
The state goes along the open loop Lyapunov level curves (in

level curves. This later trajectory cannot be seen in this case,
since at τf the system is very close to ǫ − δ stable equilibrium
(S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )), 0).
Finally, a strong social distancing is considered, by applying Rs = 0.85 from τs to τf . The results are shown

and level curves of functions V (S, I) := S ∗ − S∞ (Rs , S, I) (in red)
and V (S, I) := S ∗ − S∞ (R(0), S, I) (in green).

in Figure 9, where it can be seen that the social distancing is interrupted when S(τf ) is close to its QSS value,
S∞ (Rs , S(τs ), I(τs )), which is significantly greater than S ∗ .
So, S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) ends up at a value significantly
smaller than S ∗ , after producing a significantly large infected
second wave. Furthermore, in Figure 6, the phase portrait
of the simulation is shown, in the plane S, I, together with
the level curves of the Lyapunov functions V (S, I) := S ∗ −
S∞ (R, S, I), with R corresponding to both, the open loop
value R(0) and the social distancing value, Rs . The state goes
along the open loop Lyapunov level curves (in red) up to time
τs , then switches to a trajectory along the social distancing
Lyapunov level curves (in green) up to τf , to finally return
to a trajectory along the open loop Lyaponv level curves.
This later trajectory is significant (with a large excursion
of I(τ )), since it goes from S∞ (Rs , S(τs ), I(τs )) = 0.7,
to S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) = 0.1989. Note that the state
(S(τf ), I(τf )) is close to an ǫ − δ unstable equilibrium, and
no matter how large is τf , the system will experience a second
wave of the same magnitude.
B. Short term social distancing
Now, the case in which the social distancing is interrupted
at a transient regime (i.e., when I(τf ) 6≈ 0) is simulated. To
do that, τs = 2, as before, but τf is reduced to τf = 8 (in
adimensional units). Furthermore, several values of Rs (all
producing I(τf ) 6≈ 0, for τf = 8) are considered, to show that
S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) is always significantly smaller that
value obtained with the quasi optimal single interval social
distancing. Figure 11 shows the simulation for Rs ranging
from 1.05 to 1.8 (close to the soft and strong values of the
latter subsection). In Figure 12, it is shown the phase portrait of
the simulation in the plane S, I, together with the level curves
of the Lyapunov functions V (S, I) := S ∗ − S∞ (R, S, I), with
R corresponding to both, the open loop value R(0) and the
social distancing values, Rs . As it can be seen, the system
does not approach a steady state at time τf , so the Lyapunov
level curves along with the system evolves after τf (in green),

steers the state to values far from (S ∗ , 0). Note that even
when the social distancing is interrupted when S(τf ) ≈ S ∗ ,
a small value of S∞ (R(0), S(τf ), I(τf )) is obtained, since
I(τf ) 6≈ 0.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
In this work, the stability and general long term behavior of
SIR-type models were discuses in the context of controlling
the COVID-19 epidemic. A quasi optimal control action consisting in the single period social distancing producing
the greater final fraction of susceptible individuals - is found.
Several suboptimal scenarios are also analyzed.

THEORY

All the following definitions are referred to system
ẋ(t) = f (x(t)), x(0) = x0 ,

(10)

Fig. 12. Phase Portrait for system (2) in the S, I plane, with
several values of Rs , and level curves of functions V (S, I) :=
S ∗ − S∞ (Rs , S, I) (in red) and V (S, I) := S ∗ − S∞ (R(0), S, I)
(in green).

where x is the system state constrained to be in X ⊆ Rn , f is
a Lipschitz continuous nonlinear function, and φ(t; x) is the
solution for time t and initial condition x.
Definition 3 (Equilibrium set): Consider system 10 constrained by X. The set Xs ⊂ X is an equilibrium set if each
point x ∈ Xs is such that f (x) = 0 (this implying that
φ(t; x) = x for all t ≥ 0).
Definition 4 (Attractivity of an equilibrium set): Consider
system 10 constrained by X and a set X ⊆ X. A closed equilibrium set Xs ⊂ X is attractive in X if limt→∞ kφ(t; x)kXs = 0
for all x ∈ X .
A closed subset of an attractive set (for instance, a single
equilibrium point) is not necessarily attractive. On the other
hand, any set containing an attractive set is attractive, so the
significant attractivity concept in a constrained system is given
by the smallest one.
Definition 5 (Local ǫ − δ stability of an equilibrium set):

Consider system 10 constrained by X. A closed equilibrium
set Xs ⊂ X is ǫ − δ locally stable if for all ǫ > 0 it there
exists δ > 0 such that in a given boundary of Xs , kxkXs < δ,
it follows that kφ(t; x)kXs < ǫ, for all t ≥ 0.
Unlike attractive sets, a set containing a locally ǫ − δ stable
equilibrium set is not necessarily locally ǫ − δ stable.
Definition 6 (Asymptotic stability (AS) of an equilibrium
set): Consider system 10 constrained by X and a set X ⊆ X.
A closed equilibrium set Xs ∈ X is asymptotically stable (AS)
in X if it is ǫ − δ locally stable and attractive in X .
Next, the theorem of Lyapunov, which refers to single
equilibrium points and provides sufficient conditions for both,
local ǫ − δ stability and assymptotic stability, is introduced.
Theorem 4 (Lyapunov theorem [20]): Consider system
10 constrained by X and an equilibrium state xs ∈ X. Let
consider a function V (x) : Rn → R such that V (x) > 0 for
x 6= xs , V (xs ) = 0 and V̇ (x(t)) ≤ 0, denoted as Lyapunov
function. Then, the existence of such a function in a boundary
of xs implies that xs ∈ Xs is locally ǫ−δ stable. If in addition
V̇ (x(t)) < 0 for all x ∈ X ⊆ X such that x 6= xs , and
V̇ (xs ) = 0, then xs is asymptotically stable in X .

S∞ (R, S, I) := −W (−f (R, S, I))/R,

(11)

with f (R, S, I) := RSe−R(S+I) . Given that −W (−x) is
an increasing (injective) function of x ∈ [0, 1/e] and R is
fixed, then S∞ (R, S, I) achieves its maximum over E(δ) at
the same values of S and I as f (R, S, I) (next it is shown
that f (R, S, I) ∈ [0, 1/e] for all (S, I) ∈ E(δ)) and δ ∈ [0, 1].
Then, we focus the attention in finding the maximum (and
the maximizing variables) of f (R, S, I). Let denotes the
maximum of f as f op (δ) := max{f (S, I) : (S, I) ∈ E(δ)},
S,I

while the maximizing variables are S op (δ) and I op (δ).
Given that the maximum of f occurs at the minimal values
of I, let us consider, for simplicity, that g(S, I) = I − δ,
in such a way that we want to solve (S op (δ), I op (δ)) =
arg max{f (R, S, I) : g(S, I) ≤ 0} (we ignore the conditions 0 ≤ S ≤ 1 and I ≤ 1, but it is easy to see
the no maximum is achieved at the boundaries of these

Fig. 13. Function S∞ (R, S, I), with fixed reproduction number R =
2.5, for different values of δ, when S ∈ [0, 1] and I = δ. As it can
be seen, the maximum of S∞ (R, S, δ), for any fixed δ, is achieved at
S = S ∗ . Particularly, the maximum of S∞ (R, S, δ) over δ ∈ [0, 1]
is achieved at δ = 0 and it is given by S ∗ .

R2 S op (δ)e−R(S (δ)+I (δ)) = λ. Since R > 0, the first
equality implies that 1 − RS op (δ) = 0, or S op (δ) =

the second equality reads R2 S ∗ e−R(S +I (δ)) = λ, which is
true for any value of I op (δ) ∈ [δ, 1] and λ > 0. As we know
that larger values of f are achieved for smaller values of I,
then, I op (δ) = δ.

if R < 1. This concludes the proof. 
Figure 13 shows function S∞ (S, I) for different values of δ,
when I = δ and the reproduction number is fixed at R = 2.5.
Clearly, the maximum is achieved at S = S ∗ , when δ = 0.
Remark 8: In Lemma 1, parameter δ ∈ [0, 1] represents the
minimal initial value for the fraction of infected individuals.
This way, δ > 0 means that the initial conditions are not an
equilibrium (an equilibrium implies I = 0).
