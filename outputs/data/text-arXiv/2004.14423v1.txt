Objectives: We examine crime patterns in Santa Monica, California before and after passage of Proposition 47, a 2014 initiative that reclassified some non-violent felonies to misdemeanors. We also study how the 2016 opening of four new light rail stations, and how more
community-based policing starting in late 2018, impacted crime.
Methods: A series of statistical analyses are performed on reclassified (larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property) and non-reclassified crimes
by probing publicly available databases from 2006 to 2019. We compare data before and
after passage of Proposition 47, city-wide and within eight neighborhoods. Similar analyses
are conducted within a 450 meter radius of the new transit stations.
Results: Reports of monthly reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15%
after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown
exhibited the largest overall surge. The reported incidence of larceny intensified throughout
the city. Two new train stations, including Downtown, reported significant crime increases
in their vicinity after service began.
Conclusions: While the number of reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of
Proposition 47, those not affected by the new law decreased or stayed constant, suggesting
that Proposition 47 strongly impacted crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes decreased in
late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new policing measures that enhanced outreach and
patrolling. These findings may be relevant to law enforcement and policy-makers. Follow-up
studies needed to confirm long-term trends may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that
drastically changed societal conditions.

Introduction and background

On November 4, 2014, voters of the state of California passed Proposition 47 (hereafter
Prop. 47), also known as the “Criminal Sentences. Misdemeanor Penalties. Initiative Statute.”
or “The Safe Neighborhoods and Schools” Act. The referendum, which was approved with
59.6% of the vote, went into effect the following day, November 5, 2014 (Ballotpedia 2014).
Prop. 47 imparted three broad changes to felony sentencing laws in the state of California:
i) certain non-violent theft and drug possession offenses would be reclassified from felonies
to misdemeanors; ii) those serving sentences for the reclassified offenses would be allowed to
petition courts for re-sentencing; iii) those who had completed felony sentences now classified
as misdemeanors would be able to petition courts to amend their criminal records. Felonies
reclassified as misdemeanors under Prop. 47 include shoplifting, attempted shoplifting, grand
theft auto, receiving stolen property, forgery, fraud, writing bad checks; each up to a maximum monetary value of 950 USD. Possession of most illegal drugs for personal use, including
methamphetamine, heroin and cocaine, was also reclassified as a misdemeanor. The law allows for some exceptions, for instance reclassification may not apply if perpetrators have a
criminal record including violence or sexual offenses.
Prop. 47 was part of a series of initiatives designed to lessen California’s incarcerated
population in response to allegations of inadequate inmate medical and mental health care,
amounting to cruel and unusual punishment. In 2009, federal courts required the state to
reduce prison overcrowding and set an occupancy threshold of 137.5% of design capacity
to guarantee inmates’ Eighth Amendment rights. On May 23, 2011 and upon appeal by
the State of California, the US Supreme Court upheld this decision in Brown vs. Plata:
California’s prison population would have to decrease from approximately 156,000 to 110,000
individuals (Newman and Scott 2012). To comply with federal orders, state lawmakers
enacted significant legislative reforms over the years, including Prop. 47. Assembly Bill
(AB) 109, also known as the Public Safety Realignment Bill, and Assembly Bill 117, also
known as the Criminal Justice Realignment Bill, were approved and went into effect on
October 1, 2011 (Owen and Mobley 2012). These laws allowed those convicted of certain
non-violent crimes to serve their sentences in county facilities, under house arrest, or in
alternative sentencing schemes, rather than in state prisons. Overall, 500 criminal statutes
were amended and penalties for parole violations were reduced. On November 6, 2012,
voters also approved Prop. 36, which revised California’s 1994 Three Strikes Law mandating
a sentence of 25 years to life for those convicted of a third felony. Under Prop. 36, to be
considered a strike, the third offense must be a serious or violent felony, or the perpetrator
must have been previously convicted of murder, rape, or child molestation.
Although the state prison population fell after enactment of AB 109 and AB 117, it
was only after passage of Prop. 47 that the incarcerated population dropped below the 2009
court-mandated target (Romano 2015; Grattet and Bird 2018; Mooney et al. 2019). One
study found a 50% decline in the number of individuals being held or serving sentences for the
reclassified crimes (Bird et al. 2016). Prop. 47 also stipulated that any resulting monetary
savings should be diverted to crime prevention programs targeting youth and recidivists.
The Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund was specifically created to manage these savings,
estimated to be between 150 and 250 million USD per year. To date, 65% of payments have
been distributed to the Board of State and Community Correction, with the Department
2

of Education and the Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board receiving minor
percentages (Taylor 2016). Reducing penalties for drug possession may have also lessened
racial and ethnic disparities in the California criminal justice system (Mooney et al. 2018).
While Prop. 47 helped reduce incarceration, determining its effects on the reclassified
crime rates has proven more controversial. Several parties, including law enforcement officials, district attorneys, and mayors point to the law for rising crime (Lehner 2016; Casuso
2018; Egelko 2018; Weisberg 2019). Some studies link moderate (Bartos and Kubrin 2018)
or sustained (Bird et al. 2018; Fischer 2018) crime increases to the enactment of Prop. 47,
while other groups maintain that current data is inconclusive and that a longer term perspective is necessary (Males 2016). Aside from the disputed effects of Prop. 47 on crime
rates, it has also been claimed that the new law brought unintended consequences such as
the elimination of DNA collection for the reclassified crimes, restrictions in arresting repeat
offenders, declines in the reporting of crimes as victims learned that police would not be able
to apprehend and punish perpetrators, and making habitual drug users less likely to seek
treatment (Hanisee 2018). A preliminary analysis conducted state-wide by the California Police Chiefs Association finds that the consequences of Prop. 47 are not homogeneous among
cities of comparable size and that county specific factors, such as efficacy of monitoring and
treatment programs, and how probation and/or incarceration are handled locally, may affect
crime rates (Lehner 2016). Judging the outcomes of Prop. 47 has led to a contentious debate
within academic, political, and community settings, culminating in a growing movement to
reverse some of its reforms through a proposed 2020 ballot initiative (Keep California Safe
2020). Public safety agencies, caught between opposite viewpoints on the overall positive
or negative societal effects of Prop. 47, have often expressed the need to better understand
its consequences to optimize operations and budgets, to improve procedures, and to share
impartial findings with stakeholder groups (Hunter et al. 2017).
The goal of this work is to investigate the impacts of Prop. 47 on crime rates in the
coastal city of Santa Monica, California, population 91,411 (2019). Located in Los Angeles
County, the city is bordered by Los Angeles proper and the Pacific Ocean. Its downtown
core has recently undergone intense revitalization, fueled by high-tech start-ups, increased
tourism, and the 2016 opening of the Metro Expo Line light rail extension. The latter now
connects the beach with nearby Culver City and inner Los Angeles neighborhoods through
seven new stations of which four are located within municipal borders. The city has also
experienced rising housing costs, the displacement of long-term tenants, and increasing levels
of homelessness (Kamel 2012; Holland and Smith 2017). In recent years both the Santa
Monica Police Department (SMPD) and the local press have reported increases in crime,
including robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, and homicide, with large numbers of repeat
offenders (Sheriff’s Department 2018; Cagle 2018; Catanzaro 2019; Pauker 2019c). Dedicated
social media accounts and resident neighborhood groups (Residocracy Santa Monica 2020;
Santa Monica Now 2020; Santa Monica Crime Watch 2020; Santa Monica Problems 2020)
have been awash with images, anecdotal evidence and speculations on the root cause of
these trends. Passage of Prop. 47 is among the theories offered to explain the rise in crime;
another is the opening of the Expo Line allowing for easier transportation to and from the
city (Cervantes 2016; Neworth 2017; Harlander 2018). After a change in leadership in May
2018, the SMPD launched a series of new public safety initiatives. These included hiring
twenty new police officers, increasing patrolling and outreach efforts, establishing a dedicated
3

unit to analyze crime trends, deploying nightly security guards, adding lighting and CCTV
cameras to public garages, and even limiting the hours of operations of some businesses that
attracted large amounts of crime Renaud (2019). The SMPD also increased its engagement
with people experiencing homelessness and former inmates, helping them connect to services.
Among the newly established programs are the Neighborhood Resource Officers to facilitate
community-oriented policing, the Homeless Liaison Program, to assist the unhoused, and the
Downtown Business Services Unit to improve communication with business owners. These
initiatives are reported to have mitigated crime in the city, especially those affecting quality
of life Pauker (2019a,b).
As part of its pledge towards greater transparency, the SMPD maintains a publiclyavailable crime database, listing dates, types, and locations of crimes within its jurisdiction
starting from January 2006 until the present day (Santa Monica Police Department 2020).
Motivated by the many changes to the city, and to better quantify how violence and crime
have changed over the past thirteen years, we performed several statistical analyses on this
large body of data with a specific focus on identifying possible effects of Prop. 47. Our data
analysis is meant as a first step in quantifying long-term crime trends in Santa Monica, and
as a way to go beyond casual information and/or personal opinion. Throughout our work,
in every instance where we discuss changes to crime trends it is important to note that any
increase or decrease we present applies only to the reported crimes listed by the SMPD. This
qualifier is crucial, as inferring true crime trends would require perfect knowledge, and the
SMPD data may not be an unbiased representative sample of the actual crimes committed.
For example, the data may be affected by biases in collection methods, changes to police
routines, changes in the public’s habits, and more.
Given the above caveat, we find that the average number of reclassified monthly crimes
increased overall by about 15% after enactment of Prop. 47. The sharp increase clearly
emerges in the latter part of 2014, concurrent with passage and implementation of Prop. 47.
A decrease in crime is observed towards the end of 2018 and persists through 2019, concurrent
with the new police initiatives illustrated above. Longer term studies would be needed to
determine whether this decrease will stabilize in the future. A geographical analysis reveals
that overall the incidence of reclassified crimes after passage of Prop. 47 increases or stays
constant in all but one of the eight Santa Monica neighborhoods, with significant rises
in monthly counts in Downtown (+37.2%) and the North of Montana and Ocean Park
neighborhoods (+13.2% and +12.0%, respectively). Non-reclassified crimes instead appear
to decrease in all districts, except for Downtown which saw an 8.9% increase.
Finally, we analyze monthly average crime rates within 450 meters of the four new Expo
Line train stations opened in Santa Monica in May 2016. Of these, the Downtown Santa
Monica and 17th Street/Santa Monica College stops exhibit a statistically significant increase
for all crimes after May 2016; the difference is not significant for the 26th Street/Bergamot
and Expo/Bundy stops. The first two stations are marked by a larger number of crime
attractors and foot traffic than the other two. Crime percent increases are similar for both
reclassified (+30.6%) and non-reclassified (+34.6%) crimes at Downtown Santa Monica. At
17th Street/Santa Monica College instead the percent increase of reclassified crimes (+38.6%)
is much larger than that of non-reclassified crimes (+20.6%). Finally, reclassified crimes
increase at 26th Street/Bergamot (+30.0%) but non-reclassified ones do not vary appreciably.
These results suggest that Prop. 47 led to differential crime increases at the Expo Line train
4

stations.
Our conclusions stem from multiple statistical analyses performed on the data, which we
present in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3.1, we use a Welch’s t-test to show that the average monthly
number of crimes affected by Prop. 47 after November 2014 is significantly larger than prior to
that date. We further decompose the full 2006-2019 crime time series into three components:
a trend, a periodic seasonality, and a random residual, in Sect. 3.2. The resulting trend
increases around the end of 2014, as discussed in Sects. 3.3 and 3.4, where change-point
analysis and segmented regression analysis are used to determine trend change loci. In
Sect. 4 and 5 we analyze crime trends in each of the eight neighborhoods that comprise
the city of Santa Monica and the more circumscribed ones associated with the opening of
the Expo Line. Finally, we present a discussion and conclusion illustrating limitations and
possible extensions of this work in Sect. 6.
Understanding city-wide and neighborhood effects of Prop. 47 as well as how the opening of new train stations affect the geography of crime, may help administrators and law
enforcement better plan intervention strategies, optimize resource allocation, and prioritize
budget spending, especially in light of savings due to reduced incarceration.

Data

The data used in this study was obtained from an open source file managed and updated by
the Santa Monica Police Department (SMPD) from January 2006 to the present day (Santa
Monica Police Department 2020). The raw data includes the Uniform Crime Reporting
(UCR) classification code as determined by the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2004),
a description of the type of crime, the date on which it occurred, and the latitude and
longitude of its location. To better manage the information and perform statistical analyses
on categories with a sufficient amount of data, we collapsed some original crime categories
into coarser ones. For instance, we grouped “aggravated assault with a firearm,” “general
aggravated assault,” “aggravated assault with hands,” “aggravated assault with knife,” and
“aggravated assault with other weapon,” under the new general category “assault.” We
also set a threshold of 450 counts per category, so that if this minimum number of crime
occurrences was not met over the 2006-2019 period, the category was excluded from our
analysis due to insufficient data. Among the crimes that did not meet the threshold were
arson, embezzlement, blackmail and homicide. Misappropriation of property appears in
the database only from 2010 onwards so we also discarded this category from our analysis.
Finally, all incomplete or corrupted entries were discarded.
In Table 1 we list the general crime categories that were reclassified from felonies to
misdemeanors under Prop. 47 and their respective 2006-2019 city-wide counts. They are
larceny, fraud, narcotics possession, forgery, and receiving/possessing stolen property. We
refer to these collectively as “Prop. 47 crimes” or “reclassified crimes.” Crimes not affected
by Prop. 47 are also listed in Table 1 as “non-Prop. 47 crimes;” we will also refer to them
as “non-reclassified crimes.” Note that their cumulative counts are of the same order of
magnitude as the reclassified ones. The crime database is updated by the Santa Monica
Police Department daily; for most of our analysis we consider monthly, or in some cases
yearly, aggregates. In the following sections we compare temporal trends between the two

groups of crimes to determine the effects of the 2014 initiative. Fig. 1 gives an overall
view of the data. Larceny, one of the Prop. 47 offenses, has the highest overall incidence
followed by assault and public intoxication, both non-Prop. 47 crimes. Fig. 2 displays the
total (reclassified and non-reclassified) annual crime count from 2006 through 2019.
Prop. 47 imposed a maximum monetary value of 950 USD for crimes to be reclassified
as misdemeanors; however, no dollar amount information is specified in the data set we
examined. We used ancillary information to determine which categories should fall under
the Prop. 47 header, depending on their typical economic value. For example, the FBI’s UCR
Program for 2017 estimates the average value of property lost due to larceny to be roughly
1,007 USD per offense (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2017). In earlier years, the average
value of losses due to larceny was lower, for example in 2006 it was 855 USD per offense,
justifying its inclusion in the Prop. 47 reclassified list for all years. Larceny is here broadly
defined as the unlawful taking of property such as motor vehicle parts and accessories or
bicycles, shoplifting and pick-pocketing. Since the average street value of cocaine, heroin
or methamphetamine doses for personal use is well below the 950 USD threshold, we also
include possession of narcotics in the Prop. 47 reclassified list. The Federal Reserve estimates
that for the year 2015 total fraud from bad checks, general-purpose transactions, and credit
card accounts, resulted in 62 million single payments for a total of 8.3 billion USD, averaging

135 USD per transaction (Federal Reserve System 2018). We thus include fraud and forgery
in the Prop. 47 crime list. Finally, we do not include grand theft auto in the list of Prop. 47
crimes, since as per conversations with the SMPD, the typical value of stolen vehicles exceeds
950 USD, and thus grand theft auto incidents may fall outside the scope of Prop. 47. The
SMPD also confirmed that the monetary value associated with all the Prop. 47 crimes listed
in Table 1 is usually under the 950 USD threshold imposed for reclassification purposes.
We do not adjust crime counts for population change since the number of Santa Monica
inhabitants has remained fairly stable in the thirteen year period under investigation. The
city tallied approximately 87,000 residents in 2006, and after peaking at 93,000 in 2015, the
population is currently estimated to be 91,411 (World Population Review 2018).

Effects of passage of Proposition 47

We now perform a series of statistical analyses on the two data sets identified in Table 1:
the Prop. 47 crimes (possession of narcotics, fraud, larceny, forgery, receiving and possessing
stolen property), and the non-Prop. 47 crimes (all others not affected by legislative change).
To illustrate the geographical variability of crime, Fig. 3 displays a map of the average annual
incidence of larceny (a reclassified crime) before (2006-2014) and after (2015-2019) implementation of Prop. 47. Most events are located in downtown Santa Monica, with the average
annual crime density increasing after 2014, as can be seen by the more intense coloring in
the right-hand panel of Fig. 3.

visualization pertains to larceny, all crime types are more prevalent Downtown compared to
residential areas.

3.1

The monthly mean number of reclassified crimes increases after implementation of Prop. 47

To quantify the effects of Prop. 47 on crime rates in Santa Monica, we compute the average
number of monthly offenses subject to reclassification before and after passage of Prop. 47.
For comparison we perform the same analysis on the non-Prop. 47 crimes. Although the
specific implementation of Prop. 47 occurred on November 5, 2014, we group all November
8

Figure 4: Histograms of crime counts per month before November 2014 for Prop. 47 crimes,
subject to reclassification (left), and non-Prop. 47 crimes, not affected by legislative change
(right). For Prop. 47 crimes, the monthly average before implementation of the new law
was 281.4 crimes, whereas after November 2014 the average was 322.9 crimes per month.
Performing a Welch’s t-test shows that this 14.7% increase in the average number of crimes
per month is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. The same computations applied to
non-Prop. 47 crimes show that, to the contrary, non-reclassified crimes decrease by 13%, from
387.3 to 337.1 per month, after passage of the initiative.
2014 events as occurring after passage of the new law since we are binning data by the
month. Histograms for the four resulting subsets of data are shown in Fig. 4. The before
and after monthly crime distributions for Prop. 47 offenses are presented in the left-hand
panel of Fig. 4; before and after distributions for non-Prop. 47 crimes are in the right-hand
panel of Fig. 4. As can be seen, the Prop. 47 crime distribution is shifted to the right
after November 2014 with respect to the pre-implementation data. On the other hand, the
post-November 2014, non-Prop. 47 crime distribution is shifted to the left. These histograms
suggest that crimes affected by the reclassification process increased after passage of Prop. 47
whereas the incidence of crimes that were not subject to the new legislation decreased. To
determine whether these shifts are statistically significant we use Welch’s unequal variances
t-test (Welch’s t-test) to compare the before and after mean monthly count of reclassified
crimes. This is a two-sample test typically employed to compare two mean values when the
respective samples have unequal size or variance (Welch 1947). In our specific case, data
is available over eight years (106 months) before November 2014 and only over five years
(62 months) after the same date, leading to very different sample sizes and variances. If
the occurrence of Prop. 47 crimes listed in Table 1 were not affected by the reclassification
process, we would expect the difference between crime counts before and after passage of
the law as determined by Welch’s t-test to be negligible.
We denote by µb and µa the mean monthly number of Prop. 47 crimes before and after
November 2014, respectively; σb and σa represent the associated standard deviations, and
Nb and Na the respective number of months over which these averages were calculated.
The null hypothesis is formulated as there being no difference in the mean values, µb = µa ,
while the alternative hypothesis posits that Prop. 47 led to an increase in the reclassified
offenses, µb < µa . Our data yields {µb , σb , Nb }p47 = {281.4, 33.2, 106} and {µa , σa , Na }p47 =

9

{322.9, 53.9, 62}. The ‘p47’ subscript indicates that these statistical values are evaluated
on Prop. 47 offenses. To verify whether the before-to-after crime increase is statistically
significant we perform a one-tailed Welch’s t-test by calculating the following t-statistic
µb − µa
t= s

yielding t = 5.5 for the values listed above. This quantity must be compared to the corresponding t-value from the Student’s t-distribution (Walck 2007), once the number of degrees
of freedom ν and the significance level are specified. We denote this reference t-value as ts .
Since the before and after Prop. 47 samples are associated to different data sets, each with
their own degrees of freedom, we use the Welch-Satterthwaite equation to derive an effective
ν (Satterthwaite 1946)

(2)

from which we obtain ν = 89. Finally, we specify a significance level of 0.05 to find the
reference value ts = 1.66 from the Student’s t-distribution. Since this quantity is much
smaller than the t = 5.5 statistic found from Eq. (1), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of
the alternative one: the 15% increase in the average monthly number of reclassified crimes
after the introduction of Prop. 47 is statistically significant.
We perform a similar analysis for the non-reclassified crimes, using {µb , σb , Nb }non p47 =
{387.3, 44.8, 106} and {µa , σa , Na }non p47 = {337.1, 34.8, 62}, where the subscript ‘non p47’
refers to values being evaluated on non-reclassified crimes before and after passage of Prop. 47.
We formulate the same null hypothesis as above, µb = µa , with the alternative hypothesis
set as there being a decrease in the mean monthly number of crimes after November 2014,
µb > µa . The t-statistic obtained from Eq. (1) and the non-Prop. 47 values is t = 8.1;
Eq. (2) yields ν = 153, which results in ts = 1.66 at the 0.05 significance level. Since
ts = 1.66 < t = 8.1, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative one: the 13%
decrease in the average monthly number of non-reclassified crimes after the introduction of
Prop. 47 is statistically significant.
Thus far, our analysis suggests that the monthly occurrence of reclassified crimes increased after passage of Prop. 47, whereas crimes that were not affected by it, decreased.

3.2

Reclassified crimes increase after implementation of Prop. 47

To further identify differences in the temporal evolution of the reclassified and non-reclassified
offenses we analyze the entire 2006-2019 crime time series. Temperature variations, seasonal
cycles, and the increased criminal opportunities provided by travel and/or shopping during
holiday periods are well-known possible crime influencers (Falk 1952; McDowall et al. 2012;

Figure 5: Results from the Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with an
additive model for monthly crimes between 2006-2019. The full time series of crimes per
month Y (t) is separated into trend T (t), seasonality S(t), and remainder R(t) components.
In each panel, the top row shows the monthly data Y (t), the second row is the trend T (t)
as given by the loess smoothed data without seasonality, the third row contains the seasonal
component S(t). Finally, the remainder row contains the residual R(t) with seasonality and
trend removed from Y (t). This decomposition is performed for Prop. 47 crimes in the left
panel and for non-Prop. 47 crimes in the right panel. Note that an increase in the trend
emerges for the Prop. 47 crimes towards the end of 2014, but not for non-Prop. 47 crimes.
Lauritsen and White 2014). Although the climate in the coastal Los Angeles basin is typically
mild-to-hot and dry throughout the year, heavy rainfall is concentrated in the months of
February and March, potentially affecting crime rates. Similarly, large numbers of tourists
visit Santa Monica during the summer. It is thus important to remove seasonal effects from
the time series to better understand underlying trends. As mentioned in Sect. 2, the raw
data lists the date of each crime; for convenience we aggregate all occurrences by month to
produce a crime time series Y (t) where t is a discrete variable that labels each month from
January 2006 to December 2019. In order to separate the main trend in crime progression
from possible periodic perturbations, we use the Seasonal and Trend decomposition using
Loess (STL decomposition) method on our data set (Cleveland et al. 1990). Here, the full
crime time series Y (t) is decomposed into a trend T (t), a seasonality S(t), and a remainder
R(t) so that Y (t) = T (t)+S(t)+R(t), where S(t) is periodic and R(t) represents any residual
fluctuations of Y (t). We discard the multiplicative option where the time series is expressed

11

as a product of its components, Y (t) = S(t) R(t) T (t), since we expect seasonality effects to
remain relatively stable over the temporal arc of our data. We decompose the data using
the ‘stl’ function in the R statistical package (R Core Team 2018). The algorithm requires
several parameters to be be specified, including wtrend , the time-frame over which the data
is smoothed. Details are illustrated in Sect. A.1 of the Supplementary Information (SI).
STL decomposition results are shown in Fig. 5, where Y (t) is the number of crimes per
month from January 2006 to December 2019 for both Prop. 47 and non-Prop. 47 crimes. The
trend of the number of monthly Prop. 47 crimes starts to increase towards the end of 2014,
but no corresponding rise is observed for the non-reclassified ones. In fact, non-Prop. 47
crimes appear to be declining from 2014 onwards apart from a slight increase around 2018.
This indicates that the rise in the observed reclassified crime trend should not be attributed
to a general pattern of increasing crime rates in the city of Santa Monica, rather it suggests
that a specific event in late 2014 is responsible for the observed rise in Prop. 47 crimes,
without playing any role in the dynamics of the non-Prop. 47 ones. We identify this event
with the implementation of the new law. A significant drop in the T (t) trend emerges for
Prop. 47 crimes towards the end of 2018, persisting throughout 2019, and concurrent with
the several new initiatives undertaken by the SMPD to improve public safety and towards
more community-based operations.
Interesting observations can also be inferred from the seasonal component S(t): for both
Prop. 47 and non-Prop. 47 crimes the number of offenses increases over spring and summer,
reaching a peak in August, then declining through November. Crime rates increase again
throughout the end-of-the-year holiday season, in December and January, and decline in
February, during the rainy period. Although the main features of the seasonality components
S(t) of the reclassified and non-reclassified crimes in Fig. 5 are similar, some differences arise,
most notably behaviors in the spring and fall months. These slight discrepancies might be
ascribed to some crimes being more affected by seasonal changes than others.

3.3

A change-point in the reclassified crime trend occurs in late
2014

Having isolated the trend component T (t) from the time series Y (t), we determine whether
any statistically significant changes in T (t) arise. If so, we also aim to identify the times
at which these changes occur, and the associated confidence intervals. To do this, we use
change-point analysis, a well developed method that has been applied to many disciplines,
from economics to medicine (Page 1954, 1957; Chen and Gupta 2011). Once a time series
is given, the basic foundation of change-point analysis is to evaluate a statistical quantity
on a subsample of the data immediately prior and immediately after each time point. If the
difference between the prior and after quantities surpasses a given threshold, the selected
time point is the locus of a change-point, given that some consistency requirements are met.
This concept can be applied to the mean, variance, or any moment or derived property of
the data (Killick and Eckley 2014; Killick et al. 2016). Operationally, the detection of a
change-point is framed as a hypothesis test, where the null hypothesis is that there are no
change-points and the alternative hypothesis is that at least one exists (Page 1954, 1957).
In our case, since we expect Prop. 47 to affect the crime trend, we seek to identify the

Figure 6: Change point analysis on the M (t) slope derived from the T (t) trend for Prop. 47
crimes (left) and non-Prop. 47 crimes (right). The top panels are the T (t) trends derived from
the Y (t) monthly data using the smoothing window wtrend = 19 months in the decomposition.
The lower panels are the derived M (t) slopes on which change-point analysis is performed
after the ‘mosum’ test statistic parameters G, η,  are specified as detailed in the main text
and in Sect. A.2 of the SI. For both Prop. 47 and non-Prop. 47 crimes G = 10 months, η = 12,
 = 0.5. The left hand panel for reclassified crimes shows a change-point date of July 2014
(dotted line) with a 95% confidence interval between September 2013 and April 2015, which
includes November 2014. Most of all other {wtrend , G, η, } combinations yield a change-point
centered towards the latter part of 2014 with a confidence interval that includes November
2014. For the non-reclassified crimes in the right panel, the date of the change-point is
October 2006 (dotted line) with a 95% confidence interval between September 2006 and
November 2006. Note however, that the non-Prop. 47 change-point is strongly dependent
on the specific {wtrend , G, η, } values chosen and no time-frame emerges that is robust to
parameter changes.
time when T (t) exhibits the largest rate of change. We thus calculate the difference between
subsequent T (t) values and derive a new time series for the slope of T (t), which we refer to
as M (t). The M (t) time series is constructed by evaluating the backward difference on each
time point: if ti−1 < ti are consecutive times, we define M (ti ) = (T (ti ) − T (ti−1 ))/(ti − ti−1 ).
Since our data points are monthly values, ti − ti−1 = 1 month and M (ti ) = (T (ti ) − T (ti−1 )).
We then perform a change-point analysis on M (t) to detect where changes to the slope are
largest. We compute M (t) from the trend T (t) rather than from the monthly time series Y (t)
because fluctuations in the latter would propagate to the slope, rendering a change-point
13

analysis inconclusive. The trade-off in choosing to work with T (t) rather than Y (t) is that
the smoothing process may affect our analysis; for example the change-points may depend
on the smoothing window length wtrend , as discussed in Sect. A.1 of the SI.
Once wtrend is selected, the change-points of M (t) are calculated through the R package
‘mosum’ (Meier et al. 2019); the procedure is described in Sect. A.2 of the SI. As illustrated,
several parameters must be specified, including the window G over which the prior and after
subsamples are evaluated, the minimum allowed distance ηG between change-points, and the
minimum width G of a neighborhood of the change-point where the mosum test statistic
surpasses the reference threshold for all data points in the G neighborhood. These G, η, 
parameters affect the location of the change-point and the associated confidence intervals,
in addition to wtrend from the decomposition.
Results for Prop. 47 and non-Prop. 47 crimes are shown in Fig. 6. The estimated changepoint for the Prop. 47 crimes for wtrend = 19 months, G = 10 months, η = 12,  = 0.5 is
detected to be July 2014 with a 95% margin of error that includes November 2014. Other
choices of {wtrend , G, η, } yield different change-point estimates, most notably reducing wtrend
will shift the change-point towards later dates. For example wtrend = 5 months, G = 10
months, η = 10,  = 0.5 yields a change point of August 2014 with a 95% margin of error
of ten months, which also includes November 2014. We performed change-point analysis
for a large set of {wtrend , G, η, } combinations. For all of them changes in the rate of
Prop. 47 crimes emerged towards the second half of 2014, between June 2014 and August
2014, The choice of wtrend = 1, which corresponds to building the slope M (t) from the full
time series Y (t) without any smoothing procedure, typically yields no change-points due to
the irregularity of the data, as mentioned above. Some parameter choices allow us to identify
additional change-points at the end of 2018. For example, wtrend = 19 months, G = 5 months,
η = 5,  = 0.5 yield October 2018 as a new change-point in addition to June 2014. This is
true for other {wtrend , G, η, } combinations that allow for a smaller window size and a smaller
distance between change-points. Thus, while the main change-point remains between June
2014 and August 2014, a minor one also arises towards the end of 2018 for Prop. 47 crimes.
The change-point loci for the non-Prop. 47 crimes are more heavily dependent on the chosen
{wtrend , G, η, } parameters, and typically do not extend into 2014. In conclusion, most of the
parameter combinations tested yield change-point loci for the Prop. 47 crimes that remain
within the June 2014 to August 2014 window, with November 2014 falling within the 95%
confidence interval in all cases.

3.4

A breakpoint for Prop. 47 crimes is located at November 2014

We now perform segmented regression on the monthly time series Y (t) and on the trend T (t)
of both reclassified and non-reclassified crimes as an alternative method to identify the time
at which changes occur in the respective data sets. Segmented regression is typically used
when abrupt changes are expected in the relationship between an explanatory and a response
variable. This relationship is assumed to be piece-wise linear, with segments separated by
so-called breakpoints. Under the assumption of a single breakpoint, an initial guess of its
location is made and the response variable is fit to two lines, one before and one after the
putative breakpoint with the constraint that the overall fit is continuous at the breakpoint
itself. The resulting curve is the first estimate on which nonlinear regression models are iter14

Figure 7: Segmented regression with two breakpoints on Y (t) and T (t) for the reclassified
(left) and non-reclassified (right) crimes. The decomposition assumes wtrend = 19 months.
Breakpoints (BP) are represented by dots and the respective 95% confidence intervals are
marked by bars; they are both reported in the text below each panel. For the Prop. 47
crimes the first breakpoint is November 2014 for Y (t), and October 2014 for T (t). Values of
1 < wtrend < 19 months preserve the T (t) breakpoint. The second breakpoint is September
2018 for Y (t), and November 2018 for T (t). The first breakpoint signals a transition to
higher crime for both Y (t) and T (t), the second one a decrease. For the non-Prop. 47 crimes,
breakpoint dates are highly unstable and sensitive to changes in wtrend .
ated through least squares, or weighted least squares, methods until convergence is reached
and a breakpoint t∗ identified. This procedure can be extended to multiple breakpoints.
We use the R package ‘segmented’ (Muggeo 2008) to perform segmented regression on
Y (t) for Prop. 47 crimes, and on the corresponding T (t) obtained by setting wtrend = 19
months. Since a visual inspection of T (t) reveals at least two possible major changes occurring between 2014 and 2015 and between 2018 and 2019, we impose two breakpoints to
the algorithm. Results are shown in Figs. 7. As can be seen, November 2014 emerges as
one of the breakpoints for the monthly time series Y (t); the corresponding trend T (t) yields
October 2014 as a breakpoint with a 95% confidence interval that includes November 2014.
15

The location of the T (t) breakpoint is relatively stable: lower values of 1 < wtrend < 19
months still yield October 2014 as breakpoint. The second breakpoint for Y (t) is September
2018; for T (t) and wtrend = 19 months it is November 2018. Lower values of wtrend preserve
the November 2018 breakpoint, however wtrend = 3 and 5 months yield September 2018. If
we allow for one or three breakpoints, results are highly unstable, with the breakpoint dates
changing with each algorithm run. This behavior is indicative of poor a priori assumptions
on the number of breakpoints (Bang et al. 2006).
Finally, we perform a segmented regression analysis on the non-Prop. 47 crimes by similarly allowing for two breakpoints. As shown in Fig. 7 when using the monthly time series
Y (t), breakpoints occur on December 2016 and August 2019 with 95% confidence intervals
that do not contain November 2014. Performing a segmented regression on T (t) obtained
by setting wtrend = 19 months yields one breakpoint on November 2006 and one on August
2010 with 95% confidence intervals that do not include November 2014 in either case. For
the non-Prop. 47 crimes, breakpoints for both Y (t) and T (t) are highly unstable and highly
sensitive to the choice of wtrend . Furthermore, regardless of the value of wtrend or the number
of breakpoints specified, we found no 95% confidence interval that contain November 2014, or
even a proximal time frame, as a likely breakpoint for non-Prop. 47 crimes. Hence, the abrupt
change in the reclassified time series observed in November 2014 should be attributed not
to an overall increase in crime, but rather to an event that specifically affected this category
of crimes. As discussed above, we identify this event with the implementation of Prop. 47
in November 2014. Similarly, the second breakpoint evaluated on the Prop. 47 time series
and occurring in September 2018 may be attributed to the new SMPD policing strategies
Renaud (2019); Pauker (2019a,b) which may have had a stronger impact on Prop. 47 crimes
than on non-Prop. 47 ones, for which no corresponding breakpoint was observed. This is
because reclassified crimes are generally low-level and quality of life offenses, more easily
impacted by the community-based initiatives and the increased patrolling efforts undertaken
by the SMPD, such as engagement with vulnerable populations, increased illumination, and
physical presence.

Neighborhood effects

The city of Santa Monica is divided into eight neighborhoods marked by specific boundaries
as shown in the map in Fig. 8. These are: North of Montana, Wilshire/Montana, Northeast
Neighbors Association, Mid City, Pico, Downtown, Sunset Park, and Ocean Park. To investigate the geographic effects of Prop. 47, we focus on the before and after Prop. 47 incidence
of crime in the above districts and plot the average number of crimes per year for the reclassified and non-reclassified crimes in each neighborhood. The gray bars represent the annual
number of crimes before November 2014 and the colored ones those after November 2014,
with the color-coding mirroring that of the neighborhood map.
In five of the eight neighborhoods the number of reclassified crimes increased substantially
after implementation of Prop. 47, whereas in the other three, the increase was more modest
or a small decrease was observed. Changes to the occurrence of non-Prop. 47 crimes after
November 2014 are also neighborhood-dependent, but typically involve significant decreases.
More quantitatively, we find that the most impacted areas are the Downtown, North of

bars indicate crimes occurring prior to November 2014 and colored bars represent those that

histograms for the Prop. 47 crimes shift to the right or remain unchanged, indicating an
increase or stationarity, whereas outcomes for the non-reclassified crimes may shift to the
left, indicating a decrease. The only exception is Downtown, where the non-Prop. 47 crime
distribution also shifts to the right, indicating an increase.
In Table 2 we quantify whether these shifts are statistically significant by performing
a Welch’s t-test in all neighborhoods for both reclassified and non-reclassified crimes. The

increases of Prop. 47 monthly crimes in Downtown, North of Montana, Ocean Park, Pico,
Wilshire/Montana neighborhoods are large and statistically significant. On the other hand,
we observe statistically-significant decreases in non-reclassified crimes in all neighborhoods
except Downtown, where we see a modest increase in crime per month. Overall we observe
the largest effects of Prop. 47 occur Downtown, where the average monthly incidence of
reclassified crimes increased by 37.2% after implementation of the new law. This is to be
expected as most of the reclassified crimes are crimes of opportunity and Downtown Santa
Monica is rich in crime generators such as shopping, entertainment, and dining venues that
attract large numbers of residents and tourists, but also potential offenders due to the ample
opportunities for crime these settings offer (Brantingham and Brantingham 1995). The
current analysis reveals that while increased crime levels were observed for the reclassified

crimes in most neighborhoods, the strongest effects were felt in areas that were already
primed for a criminal surge.
In Sect. A.3 we perform an STL decomposition in each of the eight Santa Monica neighborhoods, similarly to what was done in Sect. 3.2 to analyze time dependent trends at the
local level. Fig. 18 in the SI shows that Downtown is marked by the highest increase in crime
after implementation of Prop. 47 but also by the strongest decrease starting at the end of

initiatives that added more approachable police officers to engage with the community, often
on foot patrol and in highly frequented areas, and a series of measures to improve illumination and monitoring of parking garages and other public places that are more prevalent

Impacts of the Metro Expo Line light rail extension

The Metro Expo Line extension was inaugurated on May 20, 2016, connecting Culver City
to Santa Monica via light rail. As discussed earlier both the passage of Prop. 47 and the
opening of the Expo Line have been inculpated for increases in crime (Cervantes 2016;
Neworth 2017; Harlander 2018; Residocracy Santa Monica 2020; Santa Monica Now 2020;
Santa Monica Crime Watch 2020). In this section we aim to better understand whether
and how the extension of the light rail affected criminal activity around the four new train
stations located within Santa Monica municipal borders.

The possibility of mass transit leading to rising criminal activity, both inside stations and
in their immediate vicinity, is well studied. While many studies point to increases in crime
(Thrasher and Schnell 1974; Brantingham et al. 1991; Brantingham and Brantingham 1993;
Poister 1996; Block and Block 2000; Ihlanfeldt 2003), others show that the establishment of
mass transit does not necessarily lead to a decline in public safety (Loukaitou-Sideris et al.
2002; Denver Regional Transportation District 2006; San Diego Association of Governments
2009). Train and bus routes are usually concentrated in areas with high human activity,
offering more opportunities for predatory crime. However, the impact of mass transit on
crime is found to also depend on the overall demographic, socio-economic, and land-use
contexts surrounding transit stops (Levine et al. 1986; Loukaitou-Sideris 1999; Loukaitou21

station themselves may help reduce the incidence of crime (La Vigne 1996; Felson et al 1996;
Loukaitou-Sideris et al. 2002).
To understand whether and how the extension of the Expo Line impacted crime rates
in the vicinity of the four new train stations in Santa Monica we consider crime count
distributions within a circle of radius 450 meters centered around the four new Expo Line
stops. A detailed map is shown in Fig. 10. We first neglect passage of Prop. 47 and consider
the total crime distribution before and after inauguration of the light rail extension on May

20, 2016. For simplicity, we categorize the entire month of May 2016 as falling before opening
of the Expo Line when creating monthly aggregates. Results are shown in Fig. 11 and in
Table 3. The crime distributions shift to the right in a statistically significantly manner
after opening of the Expo Line at the Downtown Santa Monica and the 17th Street/Santa
Monica College stops. These shifts correspond to 37.7% and 20.1% increases in monthly
crime rates, respectively. No statistically significant changes are observed around the 26th
Street/Bergamot and the Expo/Bundy stations, which are located in areas with fewer crime
attractors and human activity compared to the other two, and where the average number of
monthly crimes is also much lower in comparison.
To separate the impacts of Prop. 47 from the opening of the Expo Line we further refine
our data by binning it into three time periods: January 2006–October 2014 (before implementation of Prop. 47); November 2014–May 2016 (between the implementation of Prop. 47
and the opening of the Expo Line); June 2016–December 2019 (after the opening of the
Expo Line). As a result of this stratification, only one or less crimes per month emerge at
the Expo/Bundy stop. Given the paucity of data, we do not perform any further statistical
analysis on this station. As seen in Fig. 12 and in Table 4, there is no significant increase in
the number of overall monthly crimes near any of the other transit stops immediately after
passage of Prop. 47 and prior to opening of the Expo Line (2014-2016). Total crimes instead

Monica College stops by 32.4% and 27.7% respectively. Upon restricting our analysis to the
reclassified crimes, as shown in Fig. 13 and in Table 5, we find that Prop. 47 crimes increased significantly not only at the Downtown and 17th Street/Santa Monica College stops,
but also at 26th Street/Bergamot by 30.6%, 38.6%, and 30.0% respectively. Finally, nonProp. 47 crimes increased at the Downtown and 17th Street/Santa Monica College stops by
34.6% and 20.6%, respectively, but did not affect 26th Street/Bergamot.
Our analysis indicates that the arrival of light rail was accompanied by a surge in the

occurrence of crime in proximity of the Downtown Santa Monica stop, where all types of
crime, reclassified and non-reclassified, increased by large percentages. Light rail was also
accompanied by an increase in Prop. 47 crimes near two of the other three stations (17th
Street/Santa Monica College and 26th Street/Bergamot), while non-Prop. 47 crimes remained
stationary or decreased in all three. Tables 5 and 6 reveal that there were no statistically
significant increases in crime after passage of Prop. 47 but before opening of the Expo Line
(2006-2016) at any of the four new train stations, including Downtown. This may be due
to ongoing construction of the Expo Line, which began in 2011 and was still active when
Prop. 47 was implemented so that any associated effects could only emerge after the train
began its operations in May 2016. Finally, the interval between November 2014–May 2016
comprises only 18 months and includes one summer and two winters. This period is thus
marked by an unbalanced seasonality, which may be reflected in the corresponding monthly
averages.

Conclusions

Using a publicly-available database compiled and maintained by the Santa Monica Police
Department, we investigated whether passage of Proposition 47 in the state of California had
any impact on criminal activity. We specifically focused on crimes that were directly affected
by legislative change and were reclassified from felonies to misdemeanors. Our analysis
shows that overall the monthly count of these crimes (larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics,

forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property) increased by about 15% after implementation
of Proposition 47 in November 2014. By contrast, the non-reclassified crime count decreased
by 13% after the new legislation became effective. We used a Welch’s t-test to verify that the
reclassified crime distribution shift from less crime before November 2014 to more crime after
the same date was statistically significant, as well as signal decomposition to isolate the main
crime trends from seasonal effects. Using change-point analysis, we identified a discontinuity
in crime trend at the end of 2014. A segmented regression analysis on the monthly time series
led us to identify November 2014 as the main breakpoint. We also identified a secondary
discontinuity in the crime trend and a secondary break-point in the monthly time series,
both occurring towards the end of 2018, indicating a decreases in crime concurrent with the
new SMPD policing efforts. While these changes are too recent to reverse the overall crime
surge observed after the 2014 implementation of Prop. 47, and while it is unclear what the
longer term implications of the new initiatives will be, our results show that community
partnerships, a responsive and outward facing police force, and targeted measures, may help
ameliorate crime.
We also considered the impact of Prop. 47 on the eight neighborhoods that comprise the
27

city and verified that the largest monthly change in crime (+37.2%) occurred Downtown,
an area with many opportunistic crime attractors, such as nightlife, tourists, dining venues,
and shopping centers. Finally, we examined the effects of the opening of the Expo Line on
monthly crime rates within 450 meters from four new transit stations. We find that total
crime counts increase significantly at the Downtown Santa Monica and 17th Street/Santa
Monica College stops. Prop. 47 and non-Prop. 47 percent increases were comparable at the
Downtown Santa Monica stop (+30.6% and +34.6% respectively); at the 17th Street/Santa
Monica College stop instead, the increase for Prop. 47 crimes (+38.6%) was much higher
than for non-Prop. 47 ones (+20.6%).
Several observations are in order. The city of Santa Monica does not report the monetary
value of relevant crimes. Partitioning of the data into reclassified vs. non-reclassified offenses
is thus based on our best estimate of which crimes would, on average, fall under the 950
USD threshold, one of the conditions specified by Prop. 47 for reclassification. For example,
the initiative applies to grand theft auto but only for vehicles worth less than 950 USD.
Since the typical value of stolen cars in Santa Monica surpasses this threshold, we do not
include grand theft auto in the list of Prop. 47 crimes. It is clear that exceptions may
exist and that our partitioning may have introduced errors; however, due to the large data
sample, we expect these not to be systematic and not to have significantly affected our
results. Other biases could arise from unreported victimizations differentially affecting the
reclassified vs. non-reclassified crime categories. For instance, the US Department of Justice
estimates that the average annual incidence of unreported larceny was 41% nationwide over
the 2006–2010 period; for motor vehicle theft the same figure was 17% (Langton et al. 2012).
Similarly, reporting rates could change over time in response to changing perceptions of the
effectiveness of reporting crimes. We also observe that in the immediate vicinity of the four
new train stations in Santa Monica no increases in reclassified or non-reclassified crimes
were observed after passage of Prop. 47 but before opening of light rail. This may be due
to ongoing construction of the new crime attractor, which delayed the effects of Prop. 47.
Indeed, crimes increased dramatically at the busiest transit stations after opening of the
Expo Line, especially in the Downtown area and for the reclassified crimes. Finally, the
period between passage of Prop. 47 in November 2014 and the opening of the Expo Line in
May 2016 is only 18 months. Compounding effects of the two events may have led to the
observed increases in crime; disentangling their overlap may require more discriminants than
the data analyzed here.
Possible extensions of this work would involve analyzing crime occurrence in neighboring
cities that share similar socio-economic backgrounds with Santa Monica, such as Culver City
(population 39,000), Pasadena (population 138,000) or Glendale (population 203,000); all
within Los Angeles County, although not directly adjacent to the Pacific Ocean and less
touristic. Similarly, it would be interesting to study the incidence of crime on the other
three new Expo Line stations operating in Culver City (Palms, Westwood/Rancho Park,
Expo/Sepulveda) to compare and contrast results between the two municipalities. A longer
term monitoring of crime in Santa Monica would also be desirable. On one hand, it would
allow us to determine whether the decrease in the number of monthly crimes observed in late
2018 persists or stabilizes over time. On the other, it would allow us to better discern the
effects of the Expo Line, since the incidence of crime may temporarily increase around newly
opened stations and settle back to their original levels once novelty effects subside (Poister
28

1996). This may not be possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic that severely impacted the
global economy. Suspension of all non-essential activities and stay-at-home orders within the
city of Santa Monica, as well as reduction to service and ridership of the Expo Line, do not
allow for a meaningful, continuous, long term analysis. Although conducted over short time
frames, both after passage of Prop. 47 and the inauguration of the Expo Line, our results do
suggest that neighborhood characteristics may influence crime rates, since areas with more
opportunities for crime appear to have been affected more by the light rail extension and by
the new law. Similarly, our results show that community-based policing, a stronger police
presence and targeted interventions may help reduce crime.
Finally, although we find a rise in reclassified crimes that coincides with passage of
Prop. 47, our research does not provide a definite causative explanation for it. While it is
possible that the new law directly motivated offenders to commit more reclassified crimes,
there may also be other relevant explanations contributing to the rise. Among them, the
increased attention of police, heightened public awareness, more reporting, all of which may
have been influenced by media coverage. The observed rise may also be a loose manifestation
of the well known Hawthorne effect, whereby individuals modify their behavior as a result
of being part of an experiment or study (Roethlisberger and Dickson 1939; Adair 1984). In
this case, reporting behavior could have been affected by awareness of the changes brought
by Prop. 47. Similarly, the decrease in the number of reported reclassified crimes observed
in late 2018 may be due to shifts in policing, but also due to fading of Prop. 47 awareness, or
habituation. We hope that these and other considerations relevant to public utility, respect
for human rights, and existence of socioeconomic disparities, will be used in combination
with our results to assess the overall effect of Prop. 47.

Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL)

In our work the decomposition is performed via the ‘stl’ function in the R software environment (R Core Team 2018) using an iterative process that uses the monthly time series
Y (t) as input data and user-specified initial trend and seasonality estimates. The latter are
typically null sets. In each iteration the data is cleared of the current trend estimate and
broken into cycle-subseries, one for each of the data points within a period. In our case,
since we have monthly data with a periodicity of np = 12 months, twelve cycle-subseries

arise, one for each month. A new seasonal series is obtained through a combination of
loess (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) polynomial regression with given weights,
and moving averages performed on each of the cycle-subseries. The loess regression ensures
that the obtained seasonality is defined for all times, not just when data points are available;
the moving average procedures guarantee the mean is nearly zero. The input data is then
cleared of the newly derived seasonal effect and a temporary trend is obtained, once more
using a loess polynomial regression. The freshly derived trend and seasonal estimates are
then used as inputs for the next iteration. Any residual elements are included in the remainder and used to compute robustness weights, to reduce the influence of transient, aberrant
behavior in the data on the trend and seasonal components. The procedure is run until a
pre-set convergence is reached; typically two loops suffice.
Two window lengths must be specified to apply the loess regression in the ‘stl’ function:
wseason (the s.window argument in R) and wtrend (the t.window argument in R). Since we
do not assume seasonal patterns to have significantly evolved over the thirteen year time
span under investigation, we use the entire data to perform the loess seasonal smoothing
analysis and set s.window = periodic. Effectively, the monthly cycle-subseries are smoothed
using weighted averages over all the pertaining monthly data. Note that if seasonality were
expected to change over the 2006-2019 arc the analysis would have to be performed using
a more restricted window, so that older seasonal patterns do not affect more recent ones.
Finally, wtrend is assumed to be an odd integer and is set following standard procedures (R
Core Team 2018) as



1.5 np
.
(3)
t.window = Nextodd Ceiling
1 − 1.5 /s.window
Here, NextOdd(.) is the smallest odd integer greater than, or equal to its argument, and
30

Ceiling(.) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to its argument. Eq. (3) yields values
for wtrend that are known to prevent overlaps between the trend and seasonal components.
The value of wtrend plays a fundamental role in the decomposition process: as this parameter increases more points are used in the smoothing process, and sharper trends may
be identified. Increases to wtrend however may also minimize, eliminate, or shift peaks and
valleys. Our data set leads to wtrend = 19 months. Unless otherwise noted, we use this value
as the default; when more resolution is necessary, for example to investigate trends around
November 2014, smaller window lengths are used. Fig. 15 shows various smoothed trend
curves for different wtrend : note how the minimum located towards the end of 2014 shifts in
time and depth as wtrend is modified.

A.2

Change-point analysis

Our change-point analyses are performed using the R package ‘mosum’ (Meier et al. 2019)
which uses a moving sum to average over subsets of the data; the size of the subset G is
termed bandwidth. For a given data point, the prior and after averages over the bandwidth
are evaluated together with the respective variances; the first and last G points are discarded.
A mosum statistic is then constructed as the difference between the after and prior averages
divided by an ad-hoc standard deviation, which may be chosen as the root of the average,
minimum, or maximum of the after and prior variances. We select the average. The mosum
statistic is then compared with a threshold derived from an asymptotic distribution that
depends on the bandwidth, the size of the entire time series, and a significance level chosen
by the user. If the mosum statistic exceeds this critical threshold then the null hypothesis,
of no change-points, is rejected in favor of the alternative one; the corresponding data point
is now considered a change-point estimator.
Other criteria must be met in order to identify true change-points from the estimators
above. These criteria are imposed so that spurious peaks are discarded and multiple estimates
pertaining to the same underlying true change-point are avoided. The η-criterion is used
to set the minimum distance between possible change-points at ηG, whereas the -criterion
imposes that not only the putative change-point but an entire neighborhood of minimum
width G, with  < 1, centered about it must surpass the threshold. Confidence intervals for
the change-point locations are evaluated using bootstrap methods as illustrated in (Meier
et al. 2019).

STL decomposition in the eight Santa Monica neighorhoods

We plot here the monthly crime time series Y (t) for each of the eight neighborhoods in the
city of Santa Monica for both Prop. 47 and non-Prop. 47 crimes. As done in Sect. 3.1 we
also evaluate and present the respective trend T (t), seasonality S(t) and remainder R(t)
components through an STL decomposition. The greatest trend increase for Prop. 47 crimes
is observed in Downtown, together with a sharp decrease starting in late 2018.
