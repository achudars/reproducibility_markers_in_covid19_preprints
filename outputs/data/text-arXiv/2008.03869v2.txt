Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the world with health and economic wreckage.
Precise estimates of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 could have led to better allocation of
healthcare resources and more efficient targeted preventive measures, including insight into
prioritizing how to best distribute a vaccination. We developed MLHO (pronounced as melo), an
end-to-end Machine Learning framework that leverages iterative feature and algorithm selection
to predict Health Outcomes. MLHO implements iterative sequential representation mining, and
feature and model selection, for predicting patient-level risk of hospitalization, ICU admission,
need for mechanical ventilation, and death. It bases this prediction on data from patients’ past
medical records (before their COVID-19 infection). MLHO’s architecture enables a parallel and
outcome-oriented model calibration, in which different statistical learning algorithms and vectors
of features are simultaneously tested to improve prediction of health outcomes. Using clinical
and demographic data from a large cohort of over 13,000 COVID-19-positive patients, we
modeled the four adverse outcomes utilizing about 600 features representing patients’ preCOVID health records and demographics. The mean AUC ROC for mortality prediction was
0.91, while the prediction performance ranged between 0.80 and 0.81 for the ICU,
hospitalization, and ventilation. We broadly describe the clusters of features that were utilized in
modeling and their relative influence for predicting each outcome. Our results demonstrated that
while demographic variables (namely age) are important predictors of adverse outcomes after a
COVID-19 infection, the incorporation of the past clinical records are vital for a reliable
prediction model. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds around the world, adaptable and
interpretable machine learning frameworks (like MLHO) are crucial to improve our readiness for
confronting the potential future waves of COVID-19, as well as other novel infectious diseases
that may emerge.

Introduction
The global spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in the loss
of around 700,000 lives. Repercussions of the pandemic have wreaked havoc on the economy,
sending billions of people into lockdown and resulting in record-high unemployment around the
world. The American Hospital Association estimates a total four-month financial impact of over
$200 billion in losses for the U.S. healthcare system as a result of cancelled hospital services
(e.g., cancelled non-elective surgeries and outpatient treatment) due to the COVID-19
pandemic.[1] Our inability to provide precise estimates of COVID-19 outcomes such as death,
hospitalization, and need for ICU and ventilation, has contributed to lost opportunities for saving
lives with personalized preventive measures and making smart resource allocation plans, such
as the distribution of vaccinations. Although our inability to predict was partly due to the novelty
of the disease, now the critical question is: do we have the data and technology to accurately
predict outcomes?
Over the past decade, the U.S. federal government has made extensive investments to institute
meaningful use of electronic health record (EHR) systems. Clinical data in EHRs, however, are
still complex and have important quality issues, impeding their ability to address pressing health
issues that require rapid responses. Nevertheless, biomedical researchers are increasingly
applying data mining and machine learning techniques to clinical data for predicting health
outcomes.
Recent studies have shown that COVID-19 disease severity and mortality are associated with a
number of comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, and obesity, and demographics including
age, sex, and race/ethnicity.[2–8] A number of Machine Learning (ML) models have been
developed to predict susceptibility in the general population, the likelihood of a positive
diagnosis in a patient with symptoms, and prognosis in those with the disease.[9] Many of these
models are based on a combination of demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, and
biomarkers,[10–15] and use data from relatively small cohorts of COVID-19 patients. Jiangfent
et al,[10] for example, performed a logistic regression analysis on 299 patients that identified
age, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, and oxygen saturation as independent
predictors for mortality. Jiang et al,[15] used data from 53 patients to develop ML models that
identified elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), the presence of myalgias, and an elevated
hemoglobin as the most predictive features for disease severity, achieving approximately 7080% accuracy in modeling COVID-19 morality. Huang et al[11] examined clinical data from 125
COVID-19 patients and identified the presence of comorbidities, increased respiratory rate,
elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase as independently associated
with a worse prognosis. While the inclusion of vital signs and biomarkers in these models may
be highly predictive of some adverse outcomes of COVID-19 infection, they are typically
measured after the patient has already started to show signs of the disease and may be at a
point that is too late for a useful intervention.
Estiri et al. (2020) introduced the transitive Sequential Pattern Mining (tSPM) along with a
dimensionality reduction algorithm (MSMR), and demonstrated that together, the two algorithms
can successfully predict different health outcomes.[16,17] The goal in tSPM is to mine temporal
data representations from clinical data for application in downstream ML. The MSMR algorithm
– the short form stands for Minimize Sparsity, Maximize Relevance – applies high performance
dimensionality reduction to tSPM representations. It takes the initial set of N features mined by
the tSPM algorithm and provides a list of <400 features, through a 3-step process including
frequency-based and information-based (mutual information and joint mutual information)
filtering of a large number of features.[16,17]
We adapt the tSPM temporal representation mining and MSMR dimensionality reduction
algorithms and make adjustments to architect an end-to-end ML framework that enables

iterative feature and algorithm selection to predict Health Outcomes (MLHO, pronounced as
melo). MLHO offers an architecture for parallel outcome-targeted calibration of the features and
algorithms. The goal in MLHO is to mine relevant data representations and select the most
efficient algorithmic solution for accurately predicting future health outcomes. As the COVID-19
pandemic unfolds in many areas of the world, being able to provide personalized predictions of
adverse outcomes could be transformative to a healthcare system. In this study, we focus on
predicting four outcomes (hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death) in
patients with a verified COVID-19 infection, using their past medical records. Utilizing about 600
clinical features mined from patients’ past medical records (before contracting COVID-19), we
trained and tested predictive models that estimate risks of hospitalization, ICU admission,
mechanical ventilation, and death. We also demonstrate and discuss the predictiveness of
demographic features, such as age.

Results
The overall mortality rate in the patient cohort was 5.3%. Table 1S provides a summary of
demographic characteristics of this patient cohort. White patients had the highest mortality rate
(7.3%) of any race or ethnic group. However, the rate of hospitalization and mechanical
ventilation was highest among African American/black patients. Compared to females, male
COVID-19 patients had a significantly higher chance of hospitalization, ICU admission,
ventilation, and mortality. While the average age in the cohort of COVID-19 patients was 51, the
average age of patients who were hospitalized, admitted to the ICU, or needed mechanical
ventilation was between 62 and 64. The average age of mortality in COVID-19 patients was
much higher at 78 (Table 1S).
Figure 1 summarizes the sequential scenarios in which the four adverse outcomes are observed
in COVID-19 patients. Overall, in more than 72% of the patients, we did not observe any
adverse outcomes. Approximately, 13% of patients were hospitalized and then discharged. The
cumulative probability of patients needing to be admitted to the ICU was about 10%, which
sorted in a declining order of subsequent sequential events of 5.4% (Hospitalized → ICU →
Discharged), to 4.2% (Hospitalized → ICU → Ventilation), to less than 1% (Hospitalized → ICU
→ Died). This order supports our general hypothesis about the severity spectrum. Of the 5.3%
who died, about 4% fall into the sequential scenarios of Hospitalized → ICU → Ventilation →
Death, Hospitalized → ICU → Death, and Hospitalized → Death.

Iterative feature and algorithm selection
In phase 1, MLHO mined over 60 thousand raw (e.g., diagnosis/medication/procedure codes)
and 160 million transitive sequential (e.g., medication → diagnosis) representations. Through
the iterative feature selection, these features were shrunk to over 2,300 representations, about
900 of which were raw features and about 1,400 were transitive sequential features. As
described in the methods, both MSMR filter method and embedded methods (while training
preliminary classification algorithms) were utilized in iterative sampling of train-test data. The
other outcome of this step was identification of the top predictive algorithms. Figure 2 illustrates
the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC ROC) results obtained from
the 10 algorithms for estimating the risk of hospitalization. We found that two Boosting
algorithms obtained the best overall results: The Stochastic Gradient Boosting (gbm) -- a.k.a.,
gradient boosting machine -- and the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (xgb) with DART booster
(xgbDART).

Final modeling
We fed the shrunken clinical feature set (with ~2,300 features) to the two top algorithms for the
final model training -- with 10 iterative train-test sampling and 5-fold cross-validation, which
means for each outcome, we trained 20 final clinical models. For each outcome, we then trained
20 demographic models, in which we only used demographic features (age, gender, race, and
ethnicity). We also trained 20 models (for each outcome) using the combination of demographic
and clinical features. Table 1 presents the mean AUC ROC values obtained from the final
models for each outcome and feature class, representing the model’s discrimination power.
Overall, the models that relied on both the combined demographic and clinical features resulted
in the best modeling performance (as measured by AUC ROC). For predicting mortality and the
need for ventilation, demographic models provided slightly superior discrimination power. In
contrast, only using the clinical features resulted in superior performance in predicting ICU and
hospital admission, over demographic-only models.

To further evaluate the utility of demographic and clinical features for predicting adverse
outcomes after COVID-19 infection, we also assessed the models’ reliability for clinical
interpretation using diagnostic reliability diagrams (calibration curves). To compare the models,
we fitted smoothed trend lines as a representation of the overall calibration curve obtained from
the 10 calibration plots for each model (Figure 3). The calibration plots are produced from the
raw predicted probabilities computed by each algorithm (X axis) against the true probabilities of
patients falling under probability bins (Y axis). In a well-calibrated model, the calibration curve
appears along the main diagonal – the closer to the line, the more reliable. The calibration
curves from the both the clinical and the combined demographic + clinical models provide more
reliable predictions than the demographic-only models. Specifically, in predicting the need for
ventilation, mortality, and ICU admission, only using the demographic features does not provide
clinically reliable estimates of the risk for the adverse outcome.

Features’ relative influence
The features with the highest weights from the gbm models were assigned to 100, and the
remaining values were scaled accordingly.33 Using only the non-zero relative influence values, a
final set of 598 features used for predicting at least one of the outcomes, were identified.
Each feature was then assigned a label to assist with its interpretability. International
Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, both ICD-9 and ICD-10, were assigned to corresponding
general comorbidities. This list included cardiovascular disease, chronic renal disease, chronic
lung disease, neurological disorder, diabetes mellitus, and other chronic illness. The listed
comorbidities were previously identified as associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19.33 The
“Other chronic illness” cluster includes comorbidities such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity. Other features that were included in the
clinical model, but that did not fit neatly into a specific comorbidity, were assigned to clusters
that described their general category. Many of these categories were labeled as either complex
or general depending on the implied severity of the feature. For example, a previous billing code
for a critical care encounter was interpreted as a “Complex Inpatient Episode”, whereas a billing
code for a 25-minute inpatient encounter was interpreted as a “General Inpatient Episode”.

After transforming the features to more interpretable labels, the top five labels of each outcome
(excluding age) are listed in Table 2. In each of the combined demographic + clinical models,
age is the feature with the greatest influence on the outcome. However, after age, the features
with influence varied significantly between the different models.
For mortality, the critical features were neurological disorder, cardiovascular disease, other
chronic illness, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. The features with the greatest
weight for predicting an ICU admission were healthcare utilization episodes including previous
complex inpatient episodes, inpatient procedures, and inpatient medications. Some of the ICU
features included transitive sequence features that captured common patient narratives. For
example, a previous imaging episode followed by an inpatient medication was helpful for
predicting an ICU admission. In this case, both previous complex inpatient episodes and
inpatient medications were the most important features for determining the outcome. The critical
features for predicting mechanical ventilation were a combination of chronic lung disease and
significant healthcare utilization. Finally, the top features for a hospitalization were almost
entirely billing codes that suggested a previous hospitalization.

Discussion
Using the MLHO framework, we developed models for predicting risks of hospitalization, ICU
admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and death for patients infected with COVID-19. We
were able to model the four adverse outcomes with about 600 features from patients’ past
medical records, before they contracted COVID-19. MLHO can leverage the past medical
records in clinical repositories to quickly develop predictive models with acceptable accuracy.
One could envision different applications for such predictions. For example, we could aggregate
MLHO’s predictions based on a population’s expected rates of infection during a pandemic, to
better allocate healthcare resources in preparation for a surge in cases. It could also help inform
the allocation of critical care nurses and doctors, ventilators, hospital beds, and supplies in the
case of a resurgence of the pandemic.
Being able to predict outcomes can create possibilities for better preventive measures. For
instance, healthcare systems and regional health authorities can estimate the probability of an
outcome, to identify patients who might be at higher risk and plan for more intensive preventive
measures such as alerting the patients’ primary care providers to prioritize healthcare
maintenance visits. At such an appointment, one could ensure the patient is up-to-date on
immunizations and have an in-person discussion on the importance of taking precaution against
contracting COVID-19. Given there are limited resources for addressing this public health crisis,
being able to estimate the relative risk even among otherwise seemingly similar populations
could be extremely advantageous. For example, the algorithm could help determine who among
a nursing home population has the greatest need for receiving a vaccination.
The average age of infection in this cohort was 51. The average age for hospitalization,
mechanical ventilation, or ICU admission was between 62 and 64. But the average age of death
was 78. While the best performing models were a combination of all of the clinical records
including demographics and clinical features, age was always the highest weighted feature in
every model for determining the adverse outcome. The models’ dependence on age,
emphasizes that COVID-19 is a disease that poses extreme risk to the elderly. No other
features of the clinical record, including comorbidities or previous hospitalizations, have as
much of an impact on predicting how an individual will respond to contracting COVID-19.
Evaluating the top weighted features of the model excluding age, gives insight into how each of
the models relies on specific sets of features for making its prediction. The most important
features identified for predicting mortality, correspond well with many of the known associations
of disease severity in COVID-19.[33] This includes cardiovascular disease, neurological
disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and other chronic illnesses. Features
predictive of future ventilation include chronic lung disease and previous complex
hospitalizations. For predicting ventilation, the model accurately identifies medically relevant
features for who would need intensive respiratory support. In the case of ICU admissions and
hospitalizations, the models depend to a greater extent on previous healthcare utilization such
as inpatient stays, inpatient medications, and inpatient procedures. These healthcare utilization
features are likely correlated with underlying disease, but they collectively predict a subsequent
hospitalization or ICU admission better than the chronic diseases themselves. All four of the
outcome models have their highest AUC when clinical records are incorporated with the
demographics. The diagnostic labels in the clinical records are critical for predicting mortality
and ventilation, whereas it is the healthcare processes embedded in the clinical records that are
relatively more important for predicting ICU and hospital admissions.

Method
MLHO mines both sequential temporal and raw data representations from clinical data and
performs iterative feature and algorithm selection in a 2-phase process to learn from the
unfolding COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 4). MLHO’s architecture enables a parallel outcometargeted calibration of the features and algorithms, in which different statistical learning
algorithms and vectors of features are simultaneously tested and leveraged to improve
prediction of health outcomes. The four adverse outcomes of interest in this study reflect a
hypothetical sequential spectrum of outcome severity in patients with verified COVID-19
infection, ranging from hospitalization to ICU admission, to need for mechanical ventilation, and
ultimately to death (Hospitalization → ICU → Ventilation → Death).

Experimental Setup
We used electronic health records data from over 13,400 patients with a confirmed case for
COVID-19 between March and September 2020 and who had at least 1 year of medical history
with Mass General Brigham (MGB), since 2016. Table 1S presents general demographic
information about the study cohort. For each patient, we only included clinical records from 14

Estiri et al.
days prior to the positive COVID-19 test date. This temporal buffer ensures that no COVID-19related medical conditions are included in the model as a risk factor. The use of data for this
study was approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board (2020P001063) –
a waiver of informed consent was also approved. All research was performed in accordance
with relevant guidelines and regulations. We randomly split the data with an 80-20 training-totesting ratio. We iterated the train-test sampling 10 times to account for possible patient
population differences caused by the sampling.

Representation mining
We used the tSPM algorithm to mine temporal sequential representations. Given a list of clinical
records 𝑅! , 𝑅" , . . . , 𝑅# for patient 𝑝 at times 𝑡%! ≤ 𝑡%" ≤. . . ≤ 𝑡%&! , the tSPM algorithm mines all
avector of transitive sequential patterns 𝑋%' from possible pairs of distinct records (𝑅% , 𝑅' ), where
𝑖 ≠ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛, by setting 𝑟%' (as samples of random variable 𝑋%' for patient 𝑝) to be 1 if 𝑘% ≥ 1, 𝑘' ≥
1and 𝑡%! ≤ 𝑡'% ,and 0 otherwise. We also mined raw representations from the clinical data, which
are composed of all clinical records. To obtain a count of the raw records, for each patient 𝑝, we
sum the frequency of 𝑘! , 𝑘" , . . . , 𝑘# , as samples of a random variable 𝑋% . On the training sets, we
performed feature and algorithm selection (phase 1) and the final predictive modeling (phase 2).
We feed the combined representations 𝑋′ = (𝑋% ∪ 𝑋%' )%(' to the feature selection step.

Phase 1: Iterative feature and algorithm selection
In phase 1, as many aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic was still unknown, we perform iterative
feature and model selection on weekly-updated data from COVID-19 patients during the first
four months of the pandemic (March-June 2020). Unlike other studies that begin with a limited
set of hypothetical risk factors, we took a primarily inductive approach to selecting clinical
representations for predicting the risk of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. First, we
apply a filter method for feature selection, using a computational algorithm that minimizes
sparsity and maximizes relevance (MSMR[16,17]). Step 1 in MSMR is to cut the initial combined
vector of representations 𝑋′ to those that were observed in fewer than 0.2 percent of the
patients. On the remaining representations, step 2 in MSMR computes the mutual information
with the outcome variable 𝑌 = (𝑦! , . . . , 𝑦% ), which in this study includes labels for hospitalization,
ICU, ventilation, and death. Mutual information,[18,19] in this case, measures the amount of
information that each remaining representation contains about the outcome. Given the joint
probability distribution 𝑃)*+ (𝑥′, 𝑦), the mutual information between them is denoted as 𝐼(𝑋′: 𝑌)is:
,
(.*,0)
∑.*0 𝑃)*+ (𝑥′, 𝑦) × 𝑙𝑜𝑔 "#$
(1)
, (.*) ×, (0)
"#

$

We cut the remaining representations from 𝑋′by ranking based on the mutual information
coefficient, and update 𝑋′ to a list of around 30,000 representations with the highest mutual
information. In the third and final step, MSMR computes the joint mutual information (JMI)[20]
score for the updated vector of remaining representations, 𝑋′. The algorithm starts with a set
𝑆containing the top feature according to mutual information, then iteratively adds to 𝑆the
features maximizing the joint mutual information score
𝐽'3% (𝑋′) = ∑)*∗ ∈ 6 𝐼(𝑋′𝑋′∗ ; 𝑌)
(2)
∗
Where the random variable 𝑋′𝑋′ corresponds to the joint distribution of 𝑋′and 𝑋′∗ . As a result,
JMI also takes into account the redundancy between the features – i.e., reducing
multicollinearity among covariates. Second, we combine the feature selection with a preliminary
evaluation of algorithms for the prediction task.
Using the <400 clinical features identified by the MSMR algorithm, we train a set of preliminary
classification algorithms that perform embedded feature selection. The preliminary classification

preprint

serves two goals. First, we screened features used in those algorithms to compile a list of the
common features used for modeling the 4 outcomes. Second, during each sampling iteration,
we computed the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC ROC) on the
held-out test sets to evaluate the algorithms’ performance for predicting the outcome labels. We
used 10-fold cross-validation to train the prediction algorithm -- therefore, a 72-8-20, trainevaluation-test split. We tested 10 classification algorithms -- bartMachine: Bayesian Additive
Regression Trees,[21,22] Stacked AutoEncoder Deep Neural Network (dnn), Stochastic
Gradient Boosting (gbm),[23,24] glmboost: Boosted Generalized Linear Model, eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (xgb)[25] with DART booster (xgbDART),[26] linear model solver (xgbLinear),
tree learning (xgbTree), model-averaged Neural Network (avNNet), Elastic-Net regularized
generalized linear model (glmnet),[27,28] and Oblique random forest (ORFlog).[29]

Phase 2: Calibrated predictive modeling
The iterative feature and algorithm (preliminary classification) selection in phase 1 results in a
set of common features and a ranking of classification algorithms. The predictive modeling in
phase 2 are therefore calibrated specific outcomes. We use the top-performing algorithms (as
measured by AUC ROC) and the common clinical features to perform a final round of training
predictive models with 10 train-test sampling iteration and 10-fold cross-validation in phase 2.
We summarize and report the AUC ROCs and calibration curves from the final models as well
as the features’ relative influence values. Further, we evaluate the role of demographic
covariates in predicting the adverse outcomes after COVID-19 infection. To do so, we run 3
classes of models using: 1) only clinical features (from MLHO’s phase 1), 2) only demographic
features (age, gender, race, and ethnicity), and 3) clinical plus demographic features.
As we shall reveal in the results, the gbm algorithm was one of the top 2 performing algorithms.
As a result, we computed the relative feature influence metrics from the final gbm models to
measure features’ importance. In the gbm model, boosting estimates 𝐹E (𝑋)as an ‘additive’
