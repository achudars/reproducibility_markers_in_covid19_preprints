Abstract:
Sweden has adopted far less restrictive social distancing policies than most countries following the
COVID-19 pandemic (1–7). This paper uses data on all mobile phone users, from one major Swedish
mobile phone network, to examine the impact of the Coronavirus outbreak under the Swedish mild
recommendations and restrictions regime on individual mobility and if changes in geographical
mobility vary over different socio-economic strata. Having access to data for January-March in both
2019 and 2020 enables the estimation of causal effects of the COVID-19 outbreak by adopting a
Difference-in-Differences research design. The paper reaches four main conclusions: (i) The daytime
population in residential areas increased significantly (64 percent average increase); (ii) The daytime
presence in industrial and commercial areas decreased significantly (33 percent average decrease);
(iii) The distance individuals move from their homes during a day was substantially reduced (38
percent decrease in the maximum distance moved and 36 percent increase in share of individuals
1

who move less than one kilometer from home); (iv) Similar reductions in mobility were found for
residents in areas with different socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. These results show
that mild government policies can compel people to adopt social distancing behavior.
Introduction
On January 31, 2020, the first case of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) was detected in Sweden (a
person that had visited the Wuhan area in China) (8). On February 26, the second COVID-19 case was
detected in Sweden (a person that had visited northern Italy) (9). From February 27 and onwards,
more cases were detected, but the growth rate in new cases was initially fairly low.1 These dates
corresponds well with the first peaks observed in Google trends in Sweden between January 1 and
April 2, 2020 for the search string “coronavirus” (see the red line in Figure 1), thus indicating that a
general awareness of the new virus in the Swedish population started by the end of January (which
seems to be the case for most countries in the world).

Sweden is exceptional compared to most other countries in the world, in its quite different response
to the COVID-19 outbreak by relying on individuals acting responsibly and adhering to public
recommendations. This outlier position has led to international attention and debate (1–7). While
several other countries have adopted quite drastic policies to stop infectivity at a larger scale,
Sweden has adopted a route of less restrictive social distancing policies and mild recommendations
following the Coronavirus epidemic.2 By March 26, The Public Health Agency of Sweden’s (PHAS)

By March 26, the date used for the analysis in this paper, Sweden’s closest neighbours and the major
economies of Europe had imposed social distancing by adopting policies that implied a full, or close to full

recommendations and policy suggestions3 were still relatively mild: (i) public gatherings of more
than 500 individuals not allowed, (ii) all citizens with a cold or influenza-like symptoms asked to
remain at home, (iii) individuals older than 70 years instructed to limit contact with other persons as
far as possible, (iv) employers with the possibility to let their employees work from home
recommended to consider recommending that, (v) all education in high schools and at Universities
changed to distance teaching, (vi) non-essential travels within Sweden recommended to be avoided,
(vii) individuals without symptoms instructed to continue with their usual daily activities (even if
family members are infected by COVID-19).
There are two features of the Swedish system put forward as contributing to why Sweden has
responded very differently from other countries. First, experts and expert authorities, rather than
politicians, have an important say in the decision-making process. Sweden has a long tradition of
technocratic policy-making, where expert authorities and expert commissions have an important
role to play. As Steinmo (2013) puts it: ”there are few countries in the world that have relied as
heavily on expert commissions to address complicated or politically difficult policy issues” (17).
Second, Swedish citizens show a large (and increasing) trust in the political and administrative
system (17–19).
Maintaining a social distance is key to reducing the rate of transmission of the virus (20,21). But can
social distancing be reached by voluntary measures in a society with a high degree of social capital?
To assess the effectiveness of the policy, aggregate mobility data is vital to understand how
aggregate flows of people have changed (22), but even if such data provides unique opportunities4,
there are also important methodological challenges that need to be addressed: e.g. sample selection
problems in cases when individuals share the data voluntarily, participation and attrition related to
the policy measures of interest, or time-variant patterns in mobility. This study analyzes the effect of

lockdown (March 9-11 for Italy (10,11); March 11 for Denmark (12); March 12 for Norway (13); March 16 for
Spain and France (12); March 18 for Finland (14); March 22 for Germany (15); and March 25 for the UK (16));
see Supplementary table S2 in the supplementary material for a more detailed description of the policies
adopted in different countries.

The Public Health Agency of Sweden is the expert Agency in Sweden that has the leading role in informing the
general public on the COVID-19 development and in providing recommendations and suggesting public policies
to combat the spread of the virus. Table S1 provides a timeline showing the Agency’s views and standpoints on
the Coronavirus at different points in time. It can be noted that March 26 is well beyond both the dates when
the more draconian policies had been adopted in other countries in Europe and when Google trends peak for
Sweden on March 12 (on March 11, the WHO declares the spread of COVID-19 a pandemic and on March 13
the PHAS declares that the COVID-19 situation in Sweden has entered a new phase with a high risk of
community spread).

mild policies, and is the first (to the best of our knowledge) to relate representative mobile phone
users and their mobility patterns against a baseline in normal times and to adjust for seasonal
patterns in mobility.
Aim of the study
The aim is to estimate the causal impact of the COVID-19 outbreak under the Swedish mild
recommendations and restrictions regime on individuals’ choice of geographic location and
geographic mobility, and to assess if the observed change in geographical mobility varies over
different socio-economic strata.
Methods and data
To provide a causal answer to the research question, a Differences-in-Differences (DiD) methodology
is employed to estimate the behavioral responses to the spread of the COVID-19 and government
policies between January 16, 2020, and March 26, 2020, using detailed mobile phone data in the
greater Stockholm area. Individuals’ mobility patterns in mid-January, before the first confirmed
Swedish case (cf. Supplementary table S1) and when the general awareness of COVID-19 was still
limited in the Swedish public (cf. Figure 1), is compared to the situation on March 26, with 2,840
confirmed COVID-19 cases and 77 fatalities (25) and when the Swedish government had instigated a
number of relatively mild recommendations and restrictions (cf. Supplementary table S1). Any
general difference in mobility patterns between mid-January and end of March, not related to the
Corona epidemic, is accounted for by netting out the corresponding differences between January 17
and March 28 2019. Under the assumption that the time difference in 2019 represents the
counterfactual change in mobility in 2020, the DiD estimand will here capture the causal impact of
virus spread and government actions on behavioral responses (26,27). Throughout the analysis, we
use Thursdays as the weekday of study (Thursday is the “most typical” day (28)).
Mobile phone data is used for the greater Stockholm area with a resident population of 2,594,759
people.5 The underlying information, on which the analysis is based, is the location of all mobile
phones every 5 minutes serviced by one of the major Swedish mobile operators. Each phone’s
locations can only be tracked for a maximum of 24 hours. For this analysis phone’s locations were
aggregated to hourly data by 1km1km squares for the four dates. Sweden had a market
penetration of mobile phones of 1.27 per person in 2018 (29), and 98 percent of Swedish

households in 2017 had a mobile phone (30). As most individuals carry one phone, the number of
observed phones is approximated with individuals in the analysis.
Figure 2 describes the mobile phone density 10-11AM on January 16, 2020 (the left map shows the
larger Stockholm area, including Uppsala, and the right map zooms in on the central parts of
Stockholm).6 In total, the location of more than half a million mobile phones are observed. The
highest density, with more than 10,000 individuals per square kilometer, is observed in central
Stockholm with a high concentration of commercial and business activities. High density levels are
also observed in an octopus-like pattern along the main commuting routes (subway, commuter train
and highways) out from the center, where a high mass of business and industrial areas are located.
Residential areas are mainly located in the circle around Stockholm city center. The red arms out
from the Stockholm city center mark commuting routes with urban conglomerations. The high
density of individuals in the north-west corner is the university town of Uppsala (4th largest urban
area in Sweden).

6

The reason for using 10-11AM is to have a time point that is off the main commuting hours and the main
lunch hours. January 16 is chosen as the “normal” pre-Coronavirus date; i.e. after the main Christmas holidays
in Sweden and before individuals in Sweden were aware of the Coronavirus (c.f. Figure 1 and Table S1).

Stockholm area including Uppsala in left map, central parts of Stockholm in right map).

Results
Two types of results will be presented. First, changes in the geographic distribution of individuals
(mobile phones) at a certain time point at a certain day. Second, changes in individual (mobile
phone) mobility.
Change in population densities
The geographic distribution of mobile phones at 10-11AM on Thursday March 26, 2020, is compared
with the corresponding distribution at 10-11AM on Thursday January 16, 2020. To account for any
constant changes in mobile phone distributions between January and March, the March-January
difference in 2020 is compared to the corresponding difference in 2019 (effectively adopting a DiD
design). From the results, presented in Figure 3, a clear decrease in the central parts of Stockholm
and Uppsala can be noted (c.f. left map in Figure 3), as well as along the main, octopus-like,
commuting routes observed in Figure 3 (see, e.g., the blue diagonal line between Uppsala and
Stockholm in Figure 3, corresponding to the main commuter stretch between these two cities).
Zooming in on Stockholm (right map in Figure 3), a clear decrease in the central parts of Stockholm is

6

visible while at the same time there is a strong increase in individual densities in the residential areas
surrounding the central parts of Stockholm (c.f. the maps in Figure 2).
Figure 3: Map of changes (Difference-in-Differences design) in mobile phone densities. Differences
constructed and displayed in the maps are: [(day population, 10-11AM, Thursday March 26, 2020) –
(day population, 10-11AM, Thursday January 16, 2020)] – [(day population, 10-11AM, Thursday
March 28, 2019) – (day population, 10-11AM, Thursday January 17, 2019)].

The maps of Uppsala and Stockholm in Figure 3 indicate an increase in individual densities in
residential areas and a decrease in business and commercial areas. To get a more precise measure of
what characterizes the areas with increasing and decreasing densities, respectively, we construct
Moran’s I local index of spatial autocorrelation (MI LISA) (31) to identify areas with statistically
significant increases (so-called hot, HH, spots) and decreases (so-called cold, LL, spots) based on the
DiD estimates provided in Figure 3 (see the map in Figure 4).7

7

LISA MI identifies statistically significant clusters of low (cold spots) and high values (hot spots) using
permutation bootstrap tests to determine how these clusters cannot reasonably be reproduced by chance. See
supplementary material for more details on how the Moran’s I LISA was constructed.

7

While the general pattern of lower densities on roads and in downtown Uppsala and downtown
Stockholm is observable from the estimates in Figure 3, the MI LISA analysis clearly reveals the
locations of the significant cold spots in the mixed employment and commercial central urban areas
(the blue areas in Figure 4) and the significant hot spots in the low density suburban areas (the red
areas in Figure 4).8 This is also illustrated by comparing the distribution of distances to the 100
nearest jobs for the HH and LL area (the box-whisker plots in the right graph in Figure 4; in the HH
areas individuals have to travel a longer distance to reach the 100 nearest jobs than the individuals
in the LL-areas9, indicating that they live in more residential areas.

significant increases and decreases based on the DiD estimates provided in Figure 3 (see graph on
the left) and box-whisker plots showing the distribution of the distances to the 100 nearest jobs for
the areas with significant increases and decreases, respectively.

8

Compare from supplementary figure 3 in the Supplementary material, which maps the area classification in
the CORINE Land Cover database (32) for the area under study in this paper.
9
The mean (median; max) value is 808 meters (608 meters; 2786 meters) in HH-areas compared to 244 meters
(200 meters; 1300 meters) in LL-areas.

8

To get a sense of the magnitude of the changes, we calculate the average percentage changes of the
DiD estimates in the HH and LL areas in the Moran’s I map in Figure 4.10 On average, there was a 64
percent increase in the number of phones in the HH areas and a 33 percent decrease in the LL areas.
Changes in individual mobility
To get a more direct measure of how individuals move, the maximum distance each mobile phone
moves from its home during 24 hours is calculated. The home location was deduced from the night
rest location of the mobile phone, and was calculated for 54 percent of the phones in the data (see
supplementary material for definition). Table 1 shows that on January 16, 2020, the maximum
distance travelled from home was on average 6,172 meters, and by March 26, 2020, the DiD
estimate shows that this distance had been reduced with 2,346 meters: a 38 percent reduction. This
change is mainly caused by a substantial increase in the number of immobile individuals.
Figure 5 depicts the distribution of the maximum distances moved from one’s home on January 16
and March 26, 2020, respectively, and shows a clear shift of the distribution to the left by March 26
with a larger share of very small distances moved: the share of individuals who move less than one
kilometer from home increases from 0.36 to 0.49 (a 36 percent increase) over the period.11 At the
same time the share of individuals moving 5-10 kilometers from home is reduced from 0.15 to 0.10
(a 33 percent decrease) and the share that travels 10 kilometers or more is reduced from 0.20 to
0.13 (a 35 percent decrease); cf. Supplementary table S3.
An interesting feature of the decreased mobility is that the effect seems homogenous across areas
with different socioeconomic characteristics.12 Table 1 shows that the decrease in mobility is the
same as the overall effect in areas with the 10 percent highest concentration of residents belonging
to visible minorities. The same is true for areas with the 10 percent highest concentration of
residents having a university degree, living in relative poverty13, or belonging to the risk age group
(above 70).

10

The DiD estimates are related to their pre-COVID19 outbreak values (the January 16, 2020, values).
The large share of phone users moving less than one kilometer on January 16, 2020, can be related to the
fact that 14.7 percent of the population are 75+, and that only 60.5 percent of the population above 15 are
employed (33,34).
12
Using adjacent registry data on socioeconomic characteristics, the residents in each geographical area (1km
square) can be characterized and linked to the night rest location of the mobile phone.
13
Poverty is defined as having a disposable income below 60 percent of the full population aged 16-74.

Discussion
Sweden is an outlier country in its reliance on relatively mild recommendations and restrictions in
response to the Coronavirus. By exploiting a DiD strategy, the causal impact of the COVID-19
outbreak on aggregate mobility is estimated for the larger Stockholm area using representative
mobile phone data from one of the major Swedish mobile operators. The analysis reaches four main
conclusions. (i) The daytime population in residential areas increased significantly: a 64 percent
average increase in the number of individuals in the areas with the largest increases in daytime
population (Hot spots). (ii) The daytime presence in industrial and commercial areas decreased
significantly: there was a 33 percent average decrease in the areas with the largest decreases in
daytime population (Cold spots). (iii) The distance individuals move from their homes during a day
was substantially reduced: there was a 38 percent decrease in the maximum distance moved and a
36 percent increase in the share of individuals who move less than one kilometer from home. (iv)
Similar reductions in mobility were found for residents in areas with different socioeconomic and
demographic characteristics (visible minorities, highly educated, poor, and being 70 years or older).
The results show that even mild public recommendations and restrictions can compel people to
practice social distancing, such as staying away from crowded areas and avoiding unnecessary travel.
For example, more people stay in close proximity to their home, complying with the
recommendation by the PHAS to work from home if possible. Hence, adopting a more lenient
strategy based on individuals’ judgement and sense of responsibility can be an effective strategy in a
society with a large social capital and trust in public expert authority. In addition, there can be
benefits to the more lenient strategy as it allows for flexibility (e.g. allowing individuals to take care
of important matters, and enabling parents to continue to work by keeping elementary schools
open).
An interesting and puzzling finding is that the change in mobility does not differ across areas with
different socio-economic characteristics (visible minorities, highly educated, poor, and being 70
years or older). This is at odds with the increasingly popular narrative in the media reporting a clear
socioeconomic gradient in the social distancing response (35). It is also at odds with the fact that 6 of
the 15 first fatalities in Stockholm belonged to the same minority group and resided in the same
neighborhood (36), potentially suggesting that there are area-based heterogeneities in mobility
response. A potential explanation is that this analysis measures the responses to the COVID-19
outbreak on March 26. Even if by that date the severity of the epidemic and the necessity to take
precaution might have been conveyed to most societal groups, still, the speed of adopting the social

11

distancing practices might have varied across various groups. There can also be other sources of
heterogeneity (e.g. housing conditions). We consider this to be an important question for future
analyses.
The analysis shows a non-negligible mobility response in Sweden to the COVID-19 contagion and
social distancing policies relying (mainly) on voluntary actions. This is an important lesson for policy
as it may not be necessary to close down the whole economy to achieve social distancing. But it is of
course still an open question whether these responses are large enough to slow down the spread of
the disease. Moreover, the anecdotal evidence, which must be interpreted carefully (e.g. evidence
based on Google information which may suffer from lack of comparability due to selection and
seasonality issues)14, suggests that the social distancing is somewhat smaller in Stockholm than in
similar cities with more stricter policies in neighboring countries.

Supplementary Methods
Geographical setting and generation of geo-coded data
Two main databases are used in this study, the MIND database and the PLACE database. In the
subsequent text, the databases, the data drawn and the variables constructed will be described.

Geographical variables calculated from MIND-data
MIND is the name of the database that holds all phone data that is used for analysis.
When turned-on, each phone that is within reach of cell-tower-service will be connected to a cellphone element located on a cell-tower. Cell-towers are more common in areas with greater
concentrations of homes, services or jobs. This means that the geographical spread of towers varies
substantially but is closely aligned to the population distribution.
The information from cell-towers is being preprocessed, involving operations making detailed
tracking of each person impossible, and joined with the geographical position of cell-towers. For
that, the join field was constructed based on Location Area Code (LAC), Service Area Code (SAC) for
3G and Tracking Area Code (TAC), Evolved Node B (ENB) and Sector ID for 4G-LTE. Thus, one can get
an estimation about cell phones’ mobility at the geographical resolution of the position of cell
towers. The positional data granularity, i.e. the minimal spatial object, corresponds to the size of
Service Area (SA) circa several hundred meters. Due to the large volume of data (roughly a half
billion observations per day), the calculations were carried out in a parallel manner on a Spark
Cluster operating on top of a distributed file system (HDFS). This allowed to reduce the
preprocessing delivery time from about 20 hours to about 1-1.5 hours, and offering a
straightforward way to further increase performance in the future by adding more nodes to the
cluster.

Variables describing mobility
Data from the MIND database enables tracing phone locations as they switch from one cell to
another. Since the time of any event is known (at five-minute granularity) and the location of each
cell tower is known, several time-space relevant variables were constructed.
Calculating mobility distances
First step for locating a phone and calculating the distances moved by any user is to use the
coordinate of the cell tower as the position of the phone user. As the phone user moves in space and
the phone-service is switched from one tower to another tower, a motion can be registered and
stored. However, instead of assuming that each phone moves between the towers (the service does
but not the phone), we assume that the phone moves to the half-way distance intersection point
between the cell-towers. In the subsequent steps of mobility calculations, new intersection points
are determined by finding the half-distance between the last intersection point and the new cell
tower servicing the user. The calculation is exact enough for the construction of usable mobility
data, but also coarse enough not to identify detailed trajectories of the phone-user1. The procedure
allows us to mimic mobility trajectories that come closer to factual mobility, and that is more well

We may not trace any phone for more than 24h.

distributed geographically compared to distributions using cell tower locations alone. Using this
technique, the maximum distance moved away from the assumed coordinates of origin (residential
coordinates) during the course of the day is calculated.
Aggregate coordinates created for data merging
The above estimation of the phone locations were aggregated to square km units and by hour. These
aggregations were used as indexes for joining data from different datasets to each other, but it is
central to understand that variables expressing the individuals’ travel distances were preserved. For
coordinates (x as an example) all spatial observations (on metric scale) were truncated using the
following formula:
XKM = trunc(X/1000)*1000 + 500
This means that all events were relocated to the midpoint of the 1km x 1km grid. For aggregation
timewise all events that take place within the same hour were classified into that hour (e.g. the
events occurring at 09:35 and at 09:15 both got the hour value of 9). It should be noted that a phone
user could move between the grid units within the same hour, therefore contributing to data in
more than one square and hour. Variables that are explained in the subsequent text will make
different use of these conditions.
Coordinates of Origin
Night rest position or Origin is calculated to determine the home location for each phone. We
collected coordinates, using the method described above, for each individual phone between hours
03:00 AM and 06:55 AM, and weighted the coordinates by the duration of service (the time each
phone remained under the service of a particular cell tower). The result is the OWX and OWY (Origin
Weighted X and Y) coordinates for each phone, equivalent to the duration weighted average
coordinate. The residential coordinates are truncated to km² units using the same formula as above.
The following Geographical variables created and used in the dataset are described in Table S4.

Socio-economic variables calculated from population register PLACE
Data
All population variables are created using the geo-coded population register drawn from the central
bureau of statistics Sweden generated PLACE database. The register contains data for the full
population with detailed geocoded information about income, education, age, and country of origin
for each individual, and where the residential coordinates are known on a 100 m² accuracy. The
database contains longitudinal population data but the last date of observation is December 31,
2017. Since the mobility study relies on phone mobility during winter and spring 2020 and
corresponding dates in 2019, we make use of the latest 2017 material in the depiction and
contextualisation of the phone population.

Method
In order to describe the population composition at the midpoint of each km² we are using a bespoke
k-nearest neighbor technique. The choice of a bespoke neighbor technique rather than just using the
population resident with each km² is motivated by a number of reasons. First, compared to knearest computations, fixed-area measures risk having several measurement problems related to
the so called boolean border and MAUP (1–3). In Supplementary Figure S4, the first of the listed
biases is illustrated in the two km² areas (grid areas A and B, containing 10 x 10, 100m² units each equivalent to the geocoded level of detail in the population register). Let us assume that the
different colours represent demographic qualities we want to associate with the cell-towers and
km². The illustrated cell tower (X) is providing service to the encircled population, however by
aggregating the population data on km² level (unit named A), a different set of demographic
qualities are assigned to the area and the cell tower.
Second, the k-nearest neighbor approach ensures that the same count of neighbors is used for all
computations and that the statistics are not based on too few individuals. In km²- areas B,C,D, the
demographic ratios would be based on varying population counts, where the ratio in km² area C
would be based on only two 100 m units.
The bespoke neighborhood approach makes uses a different technique for matching population data
to the phone data. In the subsequent description the various steps will be presented:
1. Using the bespoke neighborhood tool EquiPop flow (https://equipop.kultgeog.uu.se/) we
calculate the share of a selection of demographic qualities around each populated 100m2
unit. For each location the 100 nearest neighbors (full or adult population depending on
variable) are searched and the demographic ratio is calculated for each populated
coordinate. Using spatial join(in ARCGis pro), we match the rendered population
computation values to the midpoint of the KM2 on the basis of proximity. The procedure
ensures that the population variables represent the population composition at each KM2
midpoint.
2. Demographic qualities we are including in this part of the analyses include
a. Belonging to an age-risk-group (full population). In Sweden all individuals >= 70
years of age, as well as all individuals having different health conditions are
indicated as risk-groups that all other individuals should try to reduce contact with
as much as possible. We have access to age as a variable (but not health conditions)
so we calculate the share of individuals being aged 70 or older among the 100 and
500 nearest neighbors from each coordinate.
b. Belonging to visible minorities (full population): Individuals born in Africa, Asia
(minus Russia), and Latin America are listed as visible minorities. The underlying
reasons for this classification are manifold and include: risk of discrimination on
labour and housing market. In addition, recent years' migration increase is strongly
associated with VM individuals, with poor language skills, residential segregation,
etc., are more common in these immigrant groups compared to other groups. Under
the current circumstances - poor integration, lower skills in Swedish, discrimination
and segregation may lead to information deficits relating to recommended
precautions and potential risks.

4

c. Belonging to the poor group (full population). Using the EU definition of relative
poverty (9) we categorize the population having a disposable income lower or equal
to 60% of the mean disposable income as poor.
d. Belonging to a High-Education group (Adult population). Individuals having any
tertiary education are listed as higher educated. The used values represent the share
of higher educated adult individuals among the 100 nearest adult neighbors.

Selection of high-high and low-low cluster areas using Moran’s I LISA
Moran’s I local index of spatial autocorrelation (4) was constructed using ESRI’s ArcGIS Pro software
function Cluster and Outlier Analysis Anselin Local Moran’s I using neighborhood definition of
inverse distance weighting (IDW) with max distance threshold of 3 km. The 3 km distance threshold
was selected so the resulting neighborhood for the 1 km gridded data corresponds to rook contiguity
neighborhood of up to the third order. Smaller distances did not pick up the neighborhood effect on
such a grid and larger thresholds gave similar results to the 3 km. The input variable was the Diff-inDiff of day population phone densities as described in Figure S3 and Methods sections. The number
of permutations was 499 but other higher numbers gave similar results.

different time points.
Date

Information from the Public Health Agency of Sweden (PHAS)

Jan. 16

The PHAS reported that a new Coronavirus had been detected among people that
had visited a market in Wuhan in China. The Agency considers the risk that the new
virus spread to Sweden to be very low

Jan. 30

The WHO classifies the outbreak of the Coronavirus as a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern (PHEIC). The PHAS states that a few cases in Sweden is not
unlikely to be seen, but still considers the risk for infectivity in the Swedish society as
low

Jan. 31

First case of Coronavirus detected in Sweden (woman in Jönköping; had visited
Wuhan area in China)

Feb. 5

February 5: The PHAS still considers the risk for infectivity in the Swedish society as
low

Feb. 13

The PHAS still considers the risk for infectivity in the Swedish society as low. They also
consider individuals’ voluntary behavioral changes (e.g. in terms of international
travels) to be preferred over state-imposed restrictions

Feb. 20

The PHAS reports a large demand for information on the new Coronavirus. They
provide information in Swedish and English and report that the Swedish information
has had 800,000 page visits. The Agency still considers the risk for infectivity in the
Swedish society as very low

Feb. 25

The PHAS’s new assessment of the Corona situation is that the risk for detecting
COVID-19 cases in Sweden is high, but that the risk for general infectivity in the
Swedish society is low

Feb. 26

Second case of Coronavirus detected in Sweden (a person in Gothenburg that had
visited northern Italy). The risk for general infectivity in the Swedish society is still
considered as low

Feb. 27

New cases of individuals infected with COVID-19 detected in Sweden

6

March 1

The PHAS do not think that closing schools is an efficient policy. Based on existing
outbreaks of Coronavirus in other countries, they find it unlikely that healthy kids
cause infectivity. They also state that there exists no clear scientific evidence showing
that closing schools/not allowing healthy kids to go to school would decrease the risk
for infectivity in society even if school kids were infected

March 2

The PHAS now considers the risk for infectivity in the Swedish society as moderate
(increasing from low on a five-point scale; “very low”, “low”, “moderate”, “high”,
“very high”)

March 6

The PHAS recommends to avoid non-essential travel to northern Italy. The ministry
for foreign affairs in Sweden provides the same recommendation (for both northern
Italy and South Korea)

March 10

The PHAS notes signs of societal infectivity in Stockholm and Gothenburg
metropolitan areas and increases the risk level for general societal infectivity to the
highest level (“very high”). All individuals with symptoms of respiratory tract infection
are encouraged to avoid social contacts that increases the risk of spread of the
infection

March 11

The PHAS recommends against gatherings of more than 500 individuals

March 11

The WHO declares the spread of COVID-19 a pandemic. This implies no changes in the
adopted Swedish policies and recommendations

March 13

The PHAS declares that the COVID-19 situation in Sweden has entered a new phase.
The recommendation is that all citizens with a cold or influenza-like symptoms shall
remain at home

March 16

The PHAS recommends individuals older than 70 to limit contact, as far as possible,
with other persons. Intergenerational contacts within the family between the oldest
generation and the younger generations should only take place if necessary.
Employers that have the possibility to let their employees work from home should
consider recommending that

March 17

The PHAS recommends that all education in high schools and at
Universities/University colleges takes place via distance teaching (no in-classroom
teaching). The Agency thinks that individuals without symptoms shall be able to
continue with their usual daily activities

March 19

The PHAS notes that there are clear signs of general infectivity of COVID-19 in the
Swedish society, especially in the large metropolitan areas. The Agency recommends
against non-essential travel within Sweden (especially to larger cities and popular
recreational places)
