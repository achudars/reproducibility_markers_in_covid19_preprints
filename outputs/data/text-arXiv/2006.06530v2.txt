Abstract –We sample aggravated cases following age-structured probabilities from confirmed cases and use ICU occupation data to find a subnotification factor. A logistic fit is
then employed to project the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic with plateau scenarios taken from locations that have reached this stage. Finally, the logistic curve found is
corrected by the subnotification factor and sampled to project the future demand for ICU
beds.

Introduction. – The COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world and requiring every research energy
available to help local public administrators dealing
with the crisis. Brazil, unfortunately, is an emblematic
case of a public health emergency mismanagement.
Despite many voluntary initiatives [1–9], the country
lacks publicly available data that is complete, consistent and timely to monitor the pace of the epidemic.

ICU utilization and demographic data to estimate ICU
demand by Monte Carlo simulation [12].

ants, require the estimation of a number of parameters. Any future scenarios derived from the equations defining these models are critically dependent
on these parameters that, in their turn, depend on the
quality of the data available. Having data of admittedly low quality, makes the task of fitting realistic
models questionable, at best.

where α is the rate of the early exponential growth and
n̂∗ is the number of cases attained when the epidemic
hits the plateau for α(t − t0 )  1. The time shift t0
marks the inflection point n(t0 ) = n̂∗ /2.
Figure 1(a) represents Brazilian official records for
confirmed cases and deaths as they were presented at
May 17, 2020. It can be verified that, at this date, the
epidemic hadn’t plateaued yet.
We focus our analysis at the state of São Paulo, the
most populous state (≈ 21% of Brazilian population)
and also the state housing the megalopolis that is the
epidemic epicenter: the city of São Paulo (≈ 27% of
São Paulo state’s population). Figure 1(b) depicts confirmed cases for the state and the city of São Paulo until the same May 17, 2020. We do that because for São
Paulo we have daily ICU occupation reports.

Building scenarios. – We start by considering the
evolution in time of the number of confirmed cases. A
very general feature, captured by compartment models, is that there is an initial exponential growth followed by a plateau, eventually reached when the
number of susceptible declines. The simplest strucA main concern in many locations like Brazil is how ture like that is provided by a logistic function. We

The situation is further complicated by Sars-CoV-2
being a new virus with uncertain epidemiological parameters and by the complexities of severely unequal
societies. To overtake these limitations, here we use
the fact that the first wave of epidemics has already
been resolved in several locations to inform the proposition of sensible and simple scenarios based only on
very generic, yet robust, dynamical features. We then
use clinical data from those same locations, data on

Fig. 1: Epidemic dynamics: confirmed cases.

In order to find plausible values for n̂∗ we look at
the epidemic dynamics across all countries affected
and calculate relative contagion velocities β(t)/n̂(t) ,
with
β(t) = a∆k n̂(t) + (1 − a) β(t − 1) ,

(2)

for k-lagged first differences
∆k n̂(t) =

n̂(t + k) − n̂(k)
,
k

(3)

where we have used a = 0.2 and k = 5. We then
adopt to neglect countries where the relative contagion speed is greater than 0.5 % as a criteria to identify locations that have reached an epidemic plateau.
We further restrict our search to countries with total
population from five to tens of million inhabitants 1 .
For each country L that have already reached the epidemic plateau we considered the number of cases per
inhabitant as providing a different scenario, to say,
n̂∗L =

n̂ L (tc )
N,
NL

(4)

where tc time when β ≤ β c , N and NL are, respectively, the populations we want to model and the population of the country that provides the scenario.
With this simple approach we have selected
Switzerland to provide an “optimistic” scenario and
Spain to provide a “pessimistic” scenario. Table 1 lists
the number of cases expected in the plateau for the
each scenario.

case one. The state of São Paulo has a population
of N = 46, 289, 333 [15], while the city has N =
12, 252, 023 inhabitants [16] . The expected epidemic
development for the two scenarios can be viewed in
Figure 2.
Figure 2(b) makes explicit the grave situation of the
city of São Paulo. Subnotification of cases and notification delays are not taken into account. Following
current trends, we expect that both scenarios will soon
become obsolete.
Studies report that COVID-19 agravation are agedependent [17–19], making the age-pyramid central
to the task of estimating demand for ICU beds. We
suppose that confirmed cases, both for the state and
for the city of São Paulo, follow the age-pyramid [15]
as shown in Figure 2(c).
After age-structured sampling of cases, we sample
over age-dependent probabilities of ICU admission
following. For that we use data by age group reported
for United States from February 12 to March 16 [20]
(see Figure 2(d)). These data might be preliminary,
however ICU admission probability for individuals
under 60 is clearly non-negligible.
To build our estimates we assume that a individual
remains in ICU for τ = 14 days before being removed.
Given an specific day t j , the total ICU beds demand on
this day is given by
ICU
N̂ ICU (t j ) = n̂ICU
+ n̂ICU
tj
t j −1 + · · · + n̂t j −τ ,

(5)

where n̂ICU
is the Monte Carlo estimation obtained
tj
from sampling n̂(t j ), Eq.(1), from age-structure probabilities, followed by sampling from ICU admission
rates.
We also introduce a multiplicative constant S,
which accounts for subnotification of cases. This constant is found by fitting public ICU occupation data
to the median of the proposed scenarios and it is
assumed to hold for all simulations throughout this
work. Unfortunately, ICU bed occupation data is also
not widely available in Brazil [21].

city of São Paulo [3]. Age-pyramid and age-dependent ICU admission.

Results for the State of São Paulo. – ICU occupation for the state of São Paulo is reported occasionally
by the government on social networks [22–31]. These
scarce data points are represented by the blue circles
in Figure 3(a) together with both scenarios. Models
are fitted to data up to May 17, 2020 and results until
this date are depicted in gray.
Public data indicates that the state of São Paulo has
5934 COVID-19 ICU beds (availability on 05/22; calculated from [32]). We can thus find the time interval
for system collapse, that is shown in Table 2. The table
also shows demand peaks for each scenario and the
subnotification factor S.
Curves like the ones in Figure 3(a) could be constructed considering only the demand in the public
health system (SUS), since the SUS dependent population is known for each and every Brazilian state [33].
However, we lack reliable data to estimate the subnotification factor S and the number of SUS ICU beds
available for COVID-19 is not clear.
At the time of writing, we were able to extract ICU
bed occupation from social networks for eight days

after May 17 [32, 34–40]. In Table 3 we use these data
points to verify the quality of our predictions. We observe that data points are mostly compatible with the
intervals suggested by the scenarios.
Results for the City of São Paulo. – Our sampling
estimation method is quite simple and can be applied
to any population once ICU occupation data is available.
The city of São Paulo is country’s pandemic epicenter. Validation will be possible only when reliable data
is available. Unfortunately only occupation percentages are reported, but it is not clear how many ICU
beds in total are available. Thus we are unable to find
the subnotification factor S. Taking S = 2.1 from Table 2 as a proxy, we produced Figure 3(b). ICU beds
availability for COVID-19 is assumed to be 2611 [41]
on May 18,2020.
We, unfortunately, cannot assure any reliability of
these numbers, altogether with curves in Figure 3(b)
due to the lack of data for validation. We hope the
necessary data will be eventually available. The dates
when average values in each scenario reach the peak

exponential increase rate is estimated from available

based on the dynamics observed on other countries.
We employ limited ICU occupation data to estimate a
subnotification factor and then use age-structured estimates to project scenarios for the progression of ICU
demand.
Information is critical to deal with a sanitary crisis
as we are facing. It should be government responsibility to use its resources to protect taxpaying citizens.
Fortunately, we still have science as a guide.

seem to indicate that the city of São Paulo would have
already reached epidemic peak (see Table 4). However, data on daily new cases seems to indicate otherwise, pointing towards a situation worsening beyond
the worst scenario employed.
