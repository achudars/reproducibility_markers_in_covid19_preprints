Transient local over-dry environment might be a contributor and an explanation for the
observed asynchronous local rises in Covid-19 mortality. We propose that a habitat’s
air humidity negatively correlate with Covid-19 morbidity and mortality, and support
this hypothesis on the example of publicly available data from German federal states.

Keywords: COVID-19 Mortality; Habitat; Air Humidity; Negative Correlation

Covid-19 virus (Zhou et al., 2020) is transmitted through droplets which last longer in humid air.
Therefore, humidity is believed to be pro-Covid-19 infection and mortality. There are, however, data that contradict this belief. For instance, Wuhan, where Covid-19
was first identified and studied, is in humid subtropical
climate zone (Wiki-Wuhan, 2020), but December, when
mortality sharply raised, is the driest month of the year
there. The purpose of this communication is to present
and substantiate a viewpoint that air humidity negatively
correlate with Covid-19 morbidity and mortality.

consists of two parts, of different
degree of plausibility. First, mucous membranes of the
upper respiratory tract present the first and essential
barrier against Covid-19 virus entering human organism.
Hence the state of the mucous membranes is a correlate
to organism’s resistivity. Second, a dry season normally
cause respiratory mucosa to become over-dry. In presence of Covid-19 virus the latter might become a factor
of massive fatality.

The main hypothesis

Direct evidence in support of the hypothesis. Correlation
of Covid-19 with age, both in terms of registered cases
and of mortality is the first and best known fact about
this strain (Xu, Mao, and Chen, 2020). The state of
respiratory mucosa also correlates with age (Beule, 2010).
Correlation of Covid-19 mortality with low air humidity is less obvious. By way of anecdotal evidence, in
addition to the coincidence of the beginning of the epidemic with the dry season in Wuhan mentioned above,

FIG. 1 Air humidity in March vs Covid-19 mortality in German federal states (circles). The size of the circles is proportional to the population of the federal state; the labels are
abbreviations for the largest cities of the federal lands. Red

shown with the blue dashed line.

note that Seoul and especially Tokyo, where the incidence
and mortality have been lower, have on average wetter
climate (Wiki-Seoul, 2020; Wiki-Tokyo, 2020). Correlate of sharp raise in Covid-19 mortality with local dry
period may also be seen on the example of Lombardy,
where February is the driest month in Milan (Wiki-Milan,
2020), as opposed to a wetter beginning of the spring
in Rome (Wiki-Rome, 2020). The much dryer March
in Spain as opposed to e.g. more humid neighbouring
Portugal (Wiki-Lisbon, 2020) seem to point in the same
direction of raise in Covid-19 mortality correlate with
transient over-dry local environment.
As an illustrative and preliminary example of a more
systematic evidence, we have considered Covid-19 mor-

tality rate, defined as the number of deaths per number
of confirmed infections, in German federal states (WikiPandemic-Germany, 2020) where the majority of deaths
happened last March 2020. FIG.1 shows the Covid-19
mortality rate in the federal states vs the average local
air humidity in March. The local air humidity was defined as proxy recorded in the largest city of each federal state (Weather and Climate, 2020). The choice of
the German federal states data sets is motivated by the
data availability and reliability, and, in particular, by the
presumed uniformity of the data collection protocols in
Germany. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has been excluded
as the resource (Weather and Climate, 2020) gives no humidity data neither for Rostock nor for Schwerin. The
linear least squares fit (red solid line), weighted by the
most recent population size of the federal states as given
by Wikipedia, gives the slope of −8.09 with a standard
deviation of ±3.32, i.e. reliably negative. We have also
applied the Theil-Sen estimator, also weighing the data
points proportionally to population sizes, which gives the
slope of −3.10. The corresponding fits are also shown in
FIG.1 (blue dashed line). The discrepancy between the
linear and Theil-Sen estimates are not surprising as the
problem is clearly multi-factorial and we are looking at
only one of the factors. Still, the two estimates concur
that the slope of the dependence is negative, that is mortality is on average higher in a drier air and lowers with
rise of air humidity, which confirms our hypothesis on
negative correlate of Covid-19 mortality with local air
humidity.
Note that (Klein et al., 2020) presents evidence of negative correlation of air humidity with Covid-19 transmission rate based on all-China data. A similar study (Ma
et al., 2020) based on Wuhan data indicates negative correlation of air humidity with Covid-19 mortality. Both of
the studies did not seem to take into account the effect
of non-causal correlation between the seasonal increase
of humidity and decrease in transmission rate due to the
taken administrative measures. Still, both studies are interesting as they present an approach complementary to
the one we used in FIG.1, namely, both studies do not
take into account regional variations of air humidity and
Covid-19 statistics; instead, (Ma et al., 2020) is exploiting their temporal variations. In any case, the overall
conclusion from those studies concurs with our hypothesis.
The above is “direct” evidence as it allows one to hypothesise direct causal relationship: dry air causing overdry respiratory mucosa in older and vulnerable population causing increase of Covid-19 mortality.

Indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis. Dry nasal
mucosa correlates with loss of smell and taste (Beule,
2010), and loss of smell and taste correlates with Covid19 statistics (Bagheri et al., 2020).

Dry air is a known risk factor for dry eyes (NHS UK,
2018), with dry eyes being a risk factor for conjunctivitis (Brazier, 2018). Recent reports show correlates of
Covid-19 statistics with conjunctivitis (Chen et al., 2020;
The Royal College of Ophthalmologists and College of
Optometrists, 2020).
Some groups of patients identified as particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, e.g. diabetes (Xu, Mao, and Chen,
2020), also correlate with the diminished function of respiratory mucosa (Beule, 2010).
For these above evidence, the direction of causal links,
if any, is less clear.

A direct verification of the proposed hypothesis would be analysis of the
instant local air humidity in the statistics of Covid-19
incidence and mortality. A statistically significant correlation would confirm the hypothesis.
A more sophisticated way of checking the hypothesis
would be via spatiotemporal modelling of the pandemic.
Such modelling, which no doubt will be attempted by
many research groups, will be most successful if and when
it takes into account as many relevant factors as possible. Hence if the proposed hypothesis is true, taking into
account the air humidity of the habitat would improve
the quality and predictive power of the models.
Verifiable predictions of the hypothesis.

Air humidity depends on multiple parameters: the local instant and annual rate of precipitation, diurnal and annual temperature range, altitude, etc. That is why it is so difficult to
estimate air humidity based on e.g. local precipitation
only.
If the negative correlate of Covid-19 mortality with
air humidity is verified, it might suggest certain practical steps in addition to the medical and administrative
measures already in place, and those yet to be proposed
based on other considerations.
Iceland’s Covid-19 screening showed people of all ages
equally susceptible for the infection (Iceland Review,
2020), with about 50% of those infected having no symptoms at the time of testing (Ćirić, 2020). In the view
of the latter, the world wide correlation of Covid-19
with age might appear to be skewed towards those patients showing more symptoms and therefore more tested.
Therefore, it might be useful to distinguish between the
spread of Covid-19 infection and the asynchronous local
rises of Covid-19 mortality. For instance, a prolonged dry
weather may be taken as an indication of likely local elevation of Covid-19 mortality. In Madrid, August is the
driest month of the year (Wiki-Madrid, 2020), so preventative measures might be indicated to forestall or flatten
the second wave of Covid-19 there. On a general point, it
might take at least an annual cycle of the global data to

cussed, while, if true, this could immediately start saving
lives, which is the reason for this publication.

In presence of Covid-19 virus, patients with tendency
to dry respiratory mucosa might be particularly vulnerable to the exposure to dry air. Indoor environment
might become over-dry due to the winter central heating, domestic devices producing heat, especially if the
only source of the indoor humidity are people themselves
which might be not enough. It might be not possible
to alter local microclimate, not to mention an instant
change of the global one. However, control of indoor environment is feasible and might mitigate patients’ exposure to Covid-19. Balance of exposure to Covid-19 virus
in dry air against the well known exposure to bacterial
infection in a humid environment must be taken into account when developing a healthy indoor technology. To
the author’s knowledge, this aspect has not yet been dis-
