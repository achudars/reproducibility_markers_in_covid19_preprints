Abstract
Recently, [8] has proposed that heterogeneity of infectiousness (and susceptibility) across
individuals in infectious diseases, plays a major role in affecting the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT). Such heterogeneity has been observed in COVID-19 and is recognized as overdispersion (or ”super-spreading”). The model of [8] suggests that super-spreaders contribute
significantly to the effective reproduction factor, R, and that they are likely to get infected
and immune early in the process. Consequently, under R0 ≈ 3 (attributed to COVID-19),
the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) is as low as 5%, in contrast to 67% according to the
traditional models [1, 2, 4, 10].
This work follows up on [8] and proposes that heterogeneity of infectiousness (susceptibility) has two “faces” whose mix affects dramatically the HIT: (1) Personal-Trait-, and (2)
Event-Based- Infectiousness (Susceptibility). The former is a personal trait of specific individuals (super-spreaders) and is nullified once those individuals are immune (as in [8]). The
latter is event-based (e.g cultural super-spreading events) and remains effective throughout
the process, even after the super-spreaders immune. We extend [8]’s model to account for
these two factors, analyze it and conclude that the HIT is very sensitive to the mix between
(1) and (2), and under R0 ≈ 3 it can vary between 5% and 67%. Preliminary data from
COVID-19 suggests that herd immunity is not reached at 5%.
We address operational aspects and analyze the effects of lockdown strategies on the
spread of a disease. We find that herd immunity (and HIT) is very sensitive to the lockdown type. While some lockdowns affect positively the disease blocking and increase herd
immunity, others have adverse effects and reduce the herd immunity.

Introduction

In 1923 Topley and Wilson described experimental epidemics in which the rising prevalence
of immune individuals would end an epidemic. They named this phenomenon as ”HerdImmunity” [14]. Once the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT, measured in fractions of the
population that got immune) is surpassed, then the effective reproduction number, R, reduces
below 1 and the number of infection cases decreases. The exact value of this threshold is an
important measure used in infectious disease control and immunization, and its estimation
for the COVID-19 disease are used by governments worldwide in determining policies to fight
against the current pandemic.
A recent study of Oz, Rubinstein and Safra [8] proposed a new model for the spreading of
infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Under that model and the assumption that the basic
reproduction number, R0 , of COVID-19 is approximately 3, the HIT is approximately 5%,
namely, when 5% of the population is infected herd immunity is reached. This estimation was
in contrast to the allegedly “axiomatic” cutpoint of HIT ≈ 67% assumed for COVID-19 [10].
Preliminary data from COVID-19 suggests that herd immunity is not reached at the approximate 5% fraction expected by [8]. For Example, the US states of North Dakota, South
Dakota, Iowa, Utah and Tennessee with at least 12%, 11.5%, 9.5%, 9.5% and 9% infected,
respectively. Four of them have current R > 1 [12, 15].
The model of [8] is based on the observation [9, 11, 13] that the epidemic spread network
is not homogeneous, where distinct individuals are infectious (likely to infect others) and
susceptible (likely to become infected themselves) in various degrees. The heterogeneity of these
values among individuals is recognized as overdispersion or super-spreading (super-spreaders
are a class of individuals whose secondary infection rate is very high [5]). The estimates for
the COVID-19 pandemic fits this property and asserts that between 5% to 10% of the infected
individuals cause 80% of the secondary infections [3, 7].
Furthermore, a correlation between the infectiousness and susceptibility of each individual
have a drastic effect on the over-time reduction of the effective reproduction number, R, under
the spreading model of [8]. The heterogeneity and correlation of these parameters yields that
the ”super-spreaders” are extremely likely to get infected and develop immunity in an early
stage of the pandemic process. [8]’s 5% estimation of the percentage of the population that
contract the disease before herd immunity is reached was based on these properties.
In this work, we follow-up on [8] regarding the effect of infectiousness heterogeneity on the
HIT. However, we propose that infectiousness (and susceptibility) should be classified into two
inherently different types: (1) Personal-Trait Infectiousness (Susceptibility), and (2) EventBased Infectiousness (Susceptibility). We will refer to the combination of the infectiousness
and the susceptibility as Spreading.
2

The first type stems from traits of an individual. The second type relates to social events in
which every individual may participate, regardless of its personal traits. To demonstrate these
two types, consider, for example, a package-delivery person and compare it with an academic
researcher. During a single day, the delivery person has interactions with tens or hundreds of
people, and therefore has high personal-trait infectiousness. On the other hand, the researcher
may work most of the time in his/her office or interact with a small research group and as a
result has a lower personal-trait infectiousness. Yet, both of them may participate in a socialgathering event (such as a concert, a wedding, or ”just” a family birthday party). During
such an event, both have approximately the same amount of interaction (which may be quite
large), and therefore have the same event-based spreading degree, regardless of their personal
traits. It is important to note that personal-trait infectiousness relate not only to the social
behaviour of the individual; it may also relate to his/hers biological properties (e.g., his/her
body reproduces a virus faster and therefore he/she is more infectious).
We assume that the likelihood parameters of each individual consist each of the sum of two
parameters. (1) Sp (a) and Ip (a) which are the personal-trait susceptibility and infectiousness
parameters of a, respectively. Those values reflect personal traits and are drawn once (pandemic beginning) and remain constant throughout, exactly as in [8]. (2) Se and Ie which are
the event-based (cultural) susceptibility and infectiousness parameters. Those values reflect
occasional event-based spreading which is probabilistically redrawn for each individual at every
step of the pandemic. We assume that the likelihood of a to be infected is:
S(a) = p · Sp (a) + (1 − p) · Se
and the likelihood of a to infect others is
I(a) = p · Ip (a) + (1 − p) · Ie ,
where p determines the weight of each infection type. The symmetry between S(a) and I(a) is
similar to that of [8] and stems from the assumption that infectiousness level and susceptibility
level are proportional to the level of interaction the individual has with others or to its biological
properties.
We use this model to analyze the progression of an infectious disease and the value of R(n),
the effective reproduction number, as a function of the fraction of population infected. We
show that the contribution of the personal-trait spreading drops sharply at early stages of the
disease, as the super-spreaders are likely to contract the disease and develop immune at early
stages of the process. On the other hand, the contribution of the event-based spreading drops
much more slowly, and is affected very little at early stages, as its reduction is proportional
to the decrease of the susceptible population size. In other words – when super-spreaders are
3

out (event-based) super-spreading is in. Hence, R(n) may remain at high values even after the
super-spreaders population is fully immune, as opposed to [8]. This results in a slower decay
of R(n) and leads to a higher value of the Herd Immunity Threshold.
We show that for COVID-19 the Herd Immunity Threshold depends on the mix (p) between
the weights of the personal-trait and event-based spreading. In particular, we prove that the
HIT ≈ 5% estimate of [8] holds when assuming only personal-trait spreading, and that the
traditional prediction of HIT ≈ 67% holds when assuming only event-based spreading.
Having established a formula expressing R(n), we address operational aspects and analyze
the effects of lockdowns on the Herd Immunity Threshold. Lockdowns, of a variety of variants,
have been enforced worldwide in order to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. While lockdowns
might have immediate impact such as collapse of the effective reproduction and suppression
of infections and mortality, they have long-term impact as well. We discuss two different
lockdown policies: (1) An Event-based spreading targeted lockdown (e.g shut down of cultural
events). (2) A Personal-trait spreading targeted lockdown (e.g. restricting daily/professional
activities). We analyze the effect of these policies on the composition of the infected population,
on the effective reproduction number, and on the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT). We show
that while a lockdown (or a sequence of lockdowns) which is targeted at event-based spreading
reduces the disease spread by decreasing the HIT, a lockdown (or a sequence of lockdowns)
which is targeted at personal-trait spreading will act adversely and will increase the disease
spread by increasing the HIT.
The rest of the paper in organized as follows: In Section 2 we formally describe our model,
and present the effective reproduction number which plays a major role in the analysis. In
Section 3 we develop an expression for R(n), and calculate the Herd Immunity Threshold for
a general-case disease. We examine the result in a numerical discussion based on COVID-19
spreading distributions. Then, in Section 4, we study various lockdown policies, and analyze
their effect on the Herd Immunity Threshold. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section
5.

The Disease Spread Model

In this section, we present our model for the spreading of infectious disease accounting for
heterogeneity of infectiousness/susceptibility. We extend the model of [8] and propose that
there exists an event-based infection factor in addition to the factors described in their model.
Our analysis begins with a certain number of infected individuals. We measure the spread of
the disease as a function of the number of individuals who got infected. Specifically, we index
the individuals by the order they are infected and have R(n) denote the effective reproduction

4

number associated with the nth infected individual. Namely, the event whereby the nth
individual gets infected is the nth event (or step n). We use n also to denote the step of the
disease.
Measuring the spread of the disease as a function of the infected population size will be
useful in deriving the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) of the disease, namely the fraction of
the population that gets infected prior to reaching R(n) ≤ 1.

2.1

Susceptibility and Infectiousness

We follow the model of [8] and assign to each individual a a personal-trait-susceptibility parameter Sp (a) and a personal-trait-infectiousness parameter Ip (a) drawn from some probability
distributions. Those values quantify how likely a is to be infected and infect others, respectively, according to its personal traits. The values of Sp (a) and Ip (a) accompany a throughout
the entire progress of the disease, and remain at the same values. We follow [8] and define the
average conditional infectiousness ϕ(s). In our case, it is logical to parametrize ϕ(s) only by
the personal-trait susceptibility and infectiousness:
ϕ(s) := ESp (a)=s [Ip (a)] .

(1)

As was discussed, the heterogeneity of the spreading values of the population will play a
major role in our analysis. Hence, we will measure: 1
h

ρ(s, n) := Pr Sp (a) = s a ∈ Hn

i

(2)

where Hn is the healthy population at step n.
In addition, and beyond the model of [8], we assign an event-based infectiousness parameter and event-based susceptibility parameter to each individual. Those values are subject to
change through the progress of the disease. At step i we assign to a Sei (a), the event-basedsusceptibility parameter and Iei (a), the event-based-infectiousness parameter, both are random
variables whose realizations hold only for iteration i. Since the values of Se , Ie measure the
event-based-spreading of the society (assigned to its individuals at a given time), they are
drawn from probability distributions that are common for the entire population, denote them
by ΛS and ΛI .
The susceptibility of a at step i, which is the likelihood of a to be infected, is:
S i (a) = p · Sp (a) + q · Sei (a),

(3)

and the infectiousness of a, which is the likelihood of a to infect others is
I i (a) = p · Ip (a) + q · Iei (a)
1

For continuous s , Eq. (2) should be considered as a density function.

5

(4)

where 0 < p < 1 and q = 1−p. The value of p determines the mix between the spreading types.
We call p (and respectively, q) the weights of the personal-trait (and respectively, event-based)
spreading of the disease. As will be seen later, the value of p will have a drastic effect on the
Herd Immunity Threshold. Note that the special case where p = 1 gives exactly the model of
[8].
Under this model, the probability that a will be infected at step n, assuming that a was
healthy at step n − 1 is:

Basic and Effective Reproduction Number

The basic reproduction number, R0 , is a measure of how transferable a disease is. It is defined as
the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single (typical) infection in a completely
susceptible population (whose size is N0 ).
In reality, varying proportions of the population are immune to any given disease at any
given time. Hence, as in [8], we will measure the effective reproduction number, R(n), which is
defined as the expected number of infections directly generated by the nth infected individual.
R(n) = E [# of individuals that will be infected by the nth infected]

(6)

where the expectation is taken over the nth individual to be infected. As in [8], Eq. (6) equals

Reaching Herd Immunity

In this section, we analyze the changes in the composition of the population through the spread
of the disease, and the decrease of R(n) as the fraction of the population that contracted with
the disease increases. We prove the following theorem:
Theorem 3.1 (General Case Herd Immunity Threshold). For any δ when

(10)

relatively to the basic reproduction number, R0 . The threshold for herd immunity is when the
value of the effective reproduction number is 1.
Having this expression for the change in the effective reproduction number for a general
distribution, we will later use the special case of the Gamma distribution with estimated
parameters for COVID-19 [3, 5, 6] and inspect the HIT values for different p values.

Proof of Theorem 3.1 for A General Spreading Distribution

In order to prove Theorem 3.1, we establish the following claim:
Claim 3.2 (The likelihood of an individual to be infected). For a person a,
Pr[a is healthy at round n] ≈ exp (−β(n) · (p · Sp (a) + q · λS ))

Proof of Claim 3.2. The proof follows the proof of Claim I provided in [8] with modifications
required for our extended model. The proof is based on using Eq. (5) and obtaining:

The rest of the proof consists of algebraic manipulations of (13) and the full details are given
in Appendix A.

We next establish two supporting lemmas, corresponding to equations (3.6) and (3.7) in
[8], and conclude with the proof of Theorem 3.1.

COVID-19: Analysis and Discussion

We move to demonstrate the results of Theorem 3.1 on a Gamma distribution with shape and
scale parameters k and θ, respectively. The Gamma distribution was previously attributed
to the infectiousness of COVID-2 [5]. We substitute the estimates for COVID-19: R0 ≈ 3
and k ≈ 0.1. [3, 6, 8]. We assume that the personal-trait-susceptibility and personal-traitinfectiousness of the population are highly correlated. I.e., we set ϕ(s) = s. This stems
from assuming that both personal-trait infectiousness and susceptibility levels are correlated
to social interaction levels of the individual or to its biological properties.
In Figure 1 we demonstrate the decay of the effective reproduction number, R(n), and
its contributing factors, classified by their spreading types. We plot the following values as a
function of the fraction of the infected population.
R(n) = N (n) ·

Figure 1: The over-time reduction in the effective reproduction number, R(n), and its contributing factors as a function of n, assuming p = 0.5, k = 0.1 and R0 = 3. Note that n
(horizontal-axis) is normalized to percentage. In red - R(n) (Eq. (17)); In blue - Rp (n) (Eq.
(18)); In Green - Re (n) (Eq. (19)); In yellow - Rmix (n) (Eq. (20));
The blue curve in Figure 1 depicts the contribution of the personal-trait spreading to
R(n), while the green curve depicts the contribution of the event-based spreading. As can
be seen, the contribution of the personal-trait spreading drops at early stages of the disease.
This results from the assumption that infectiousness is positively correlated with susceptibility,
since if more infectious people are also more susceptible, then they have higher probability to
be infected and develop natural immunity much sooner (than the less infectious individuals).
On the other hand, the contribution of the event-based spreading is affected very little at early
stages. Its reduction is proportional to the decrease of the susceptible population, which is
linear in n. The weight of each spreading type, which is determined by p, determines the
combined behaviour of R(n) .
In Figure 2 we plot the Herd Immunity Threshold as a function of p. This demonstrates
the effect of the weight of the personal-trait spreading on the decay of R(n).

When assuming only event-based-spreading (i.e., p = 0) the HIT is approximately

R0

(21)

i.e., 67% when R0 ≈ 3 and 90% when R0 ≈ 9. This follows the classical models [1, 2, 4, 10]. On
the other hand, assuming only personal-trait-spreading (i.e., p = 1) the HIT is approximately
5% when R0 ≈ 3 and 10% when R0 ≈ 9. The 5% matches the expected threshold given by [8].
In reality, the two types of spreading contribute to infections and hence 0 < p < 1; In
order to predict the Herd Immunity Threshold, one has to estimate the value of p, given a
population. In Figure 3 we plot the effective reproduction number, R(n), throughout the
spread of the disease for a number of p values.

11

Figure 3: The effective reproduction number R(n) as a function of n throughout the disease
spread for different p values where R0 = 3 and k = 0.1. Note that n (horizontal-axis) is
normalized to percentage.
Figure 3 and the shapes of the various curves can be used to assist in predicting the value of
p at early stages of a disease. As can be seen, even when a small percentage of the population
is infected (< 5%), there is a significant difference between the R(n) values for different p’s.
Such prediction can assist in predicting the Herd Immunity Threshold.
The current data available to us for the current-spreading COVID-19 is biased due to
lockdowns of many types, which makes it challenging to estimate p and q. This estimation
problem is left open for forthcoming research.
The effect of lockdown policies on the value of R(n) and the Herd Immunity Threshold is
the subject of our next section.

4

The Effect of Lockdowns

Lockdown strategies, of a variety of variants, have been used worldwide as a major means
to fight an epidemy, specifically COVID-19. The question addressed in this section is how
such strategies affect the scope of the disease, namely how they affect the Herd Immunity
12

Threshold. We show that, depending on its type, a lockdown may either increase or decrease
the size of the population infected prior to reaching herd immunity. In particular, we show that
a personal-trait spreading targeted lockdown acts adversely on the efforts to reduce the spread
of a disease since it increases the threshold. In contrast, an event-based spreading targeted
lockdown affect positively the disease blocking and reduces the Herd Immunity Threshold.

4.1

Lockdown Policies

Large scale physical distancing measures and moving-around restrictions, often referred to as
lockdowns, can slow disease transmission by limiting contacts between people. These days,
many restrictions are used worldwide in order to slow down the spread of the COVID-19
pandemic. We classify the restrictions into two inherently different types: (1) a Personaltrait spreading targeted lockdown, for example by closing or restricting workplaces. (2) an
Event-based spreading targeted lockdown, for example by prohibition on cultural events.
Formally, these lockdowns will be defined as follows:
Definition 4.1 (Personal-Trait Spreading Targeted Lockdown). During a personal-trait
spreading targeted lockdown, the infectiousness and susceptibility of an individual a is:
I i (a) = pL · Ip (a) + q · Iei (a), S i (a) = pL · Sp (a) + q · Sei (a),
where q remains the same and pL = 0.
Definition 4.2 (Event-Based Spreading Targeted Lockdown). During an event-based spreading targeted lockdown, the infectiousness and susceptibility of an individual a is:
I i (a) = p · Ip (a) + qL · Iei (a), S i (a) = p · Sp (a) + qL · Sei (a),
where p remains the same and qL = 0.
We will use the following notation. Assume that a lockdown starts at the nb th step of
the disease and ends at step ne . For any n ∈ [nb , ne ], let RL (n) be the expected value of the
effective reproduction number during the lockdown; For any n > ne let RL (n) be its expected
value after the lockdown is released and p (or q) returns to its original value. Similarly, let
HIT be the Herd Immunity Threshold assuming a ”natural” spread of the disease (i.e., no
lockdown), and HITL be the threshold assuming a lockdown was performed. Note that the
comparison between the natural evolution and the lockdown evolution is based on the number
of individuals that contract the disease during those evolutions. I.e., the coupling between the
evolutions is done user by user by the order of infection rather than by the time period in
which the policies are compared. This coupling method is useful in deriving HIT and HITL .
13

At nb we set pL = 0 or qL = 0. Hence, the value of the effective reproduction number is
likely to drop during the lockdown. The question we answer in this section is if – and what –
will be the long-term impact of the lockdown, after it is released (at n > ne ). Since at ne the
value of p (or q) will increase, RL (n) is most likely to increase as well. Yet, will it pass R(n)?
Will it stay below it? Consequently, what will be the impact on the Herd Immunity Threshed?
The next two theorems establish that any personal-trait spreading targeted lockdown will
increase the HIT while any event-based spreading targeted lockdown will decrease the HIT.
Theorem 4.3 (HIT of Personal-Trait Spreading Targeted Lockdown). Assume that a personaltrait spreading targeted lockdown was performed for n ∈ [nb , ne ]. Then for any n > ne ,
R(n) < RL (n).

(22)

Consequently,
HIT < HITL .
Theorem 4.4 (HIT of Event-Based Spreading Targeted Lockdown). Assume that an eventbased spreading targeted lockdown was performed for n ∈ [nb , ne ]. Then for any n > ne ,
RL (n) < R(n).

(23)

Consequently,
HIT > HITL .
Due to the generality of Theorems 4.3 and 4.4, we state the following corollary:
Corollary 4.5. Any sequence of personal-trait spreading targeted lockdowns will result with
HIT < HITL . Similarly, any sequence of event-Based spreading targeted lockdowns will result
with HIT > HITL .
The following claim will be useful in proving Theorems 4.3 and 4.4.
Claim 4.6. Let S1 , S2 be continuous random
P1 (), P2 () their CDFs, respectively. Let r() be
s1 > s2 :
ρ2 (s2 )
ρ2 (s1 )

an injective monotone function. If for any

Personal-Trait Lockdown: Proving Theorem 4.3

Recall that ρ(s, n) is the normalized susceptibility distribution (density) at step n assuming a
”natural” spread of the disease (i.e., no lockdown). Let ρL (s, n) be the normalized susceptibility
distribution (density) at step n assuming that a lockdown was performed.
Proof of Theorem 4.3. Resulting from Lemma 3.3 and by the assumption that pL = 0 for
nb ≤ n ≤ ne , at the end of the (personal-trait) lockdown, i.e. at ne , it holds that
ρL (s, ne ) = ρL (s, nb ) = ρ(s, nb ).
However,
ρ(s, ne ) ≈ R
Therefore,

where c =

ρ(s, nb ) · exp (−β(nb , ne ) · (p · s))
.
ρ(σ, nb ) · exp (−β(nb , ne ) · (p · σ)) dσ

ρL (s, ne )
≈ exp (β(nb , ne ) · (p · s)) · c
ρ(s, ne )
R

(24)

(25)

(26)

ρ(σ, nb ) · exp (−β(nb , ne ) · (p · σ)) dσ. Therefore, for any s1 > s2 :
ρL (s2 , ne )
ρL (s1 , ne )
>
.
ρ(s1 , ne )
ρ(s2 , ne )

(27)

Note that: r(s) = (p · s + q · λS )2 is an injective monotone function. Hence, by the definition
of R(n) (Eq. (8)) and from Claim 4.6:
R(ne ) < RL (ne ).

(28)

This is demonstrated in Figure 4.
More specifically, Since ρL (s, ne ) = ρ(s, nb ) (Eq. (24)), and by Eq. (8), it holds that
RL (ne ) =

N0 − ne
R(nb ).
N0 − nb

(29)

We move to measure the value of the effective reproduction number after the lockdown
ends. Let n > ne , and denote
n − ne
x=
.
N0 − ne
Let
n0 = nb + x · (N0 − nb )
(note that n = ne + x · (N0 − ne )). n and n0 are depicted in Figure 5.
At the end of the lockdown p returns to its original value and the disease spreads naturally,
with its original parameters. At that point (ne ), according to Eq. (24), the distribution of
the population is the same as it was before the lockdown began, where only the size of the

susceptible population was changed. In other words, RL (red) behave to the right of ne exactly
as R (blue) behaves to the right of nb (see Figure 5). Therefore,
RL (n)

linear reduction in the value of R(n0 ). As proven, the purple and red curves intersect at n.

Using Eq. (31)
r̃ = RL (n).
In Eq. (32) r̃ was calculated using ρ(σ, n0 ). Hence, as in Eq. (27) and (28),
R(n) < r̃,
and we have that R(n) < RL (n). This holds for any n > ne , and we conclude that HIT <
HITL .

Hence, while performing a personal-trait spreading targeted lockdown will reduce the value
of the effective reproduction number during the lockdown, it might increase the number of
individuals that contract with the disease, prior to reaching herd immunity. In addition,
note that even if ”herd immunity” is reached during the lockdown (i.e., having RL (n) < 1 for
17

n ∈ [nb , ne ]), it might not hold once the lockdown releases as the effective reproduction number
might become greater than 1.

Event-Based Lockdown: Proving Theorem 4.4

In the proof of Theorem 4.4 we use the following notation. Let
β(n1 , n2 ) =

nX
2 −1
i=n1

1
.
N (i) · E[S i (Hi )]

I.e., β(n1 , n2 ) = β(n2 ) − β(n1 ) according to Eq. (12). Let βL (n1 , n2 ) be defined assuming that
a lockdown was performed. We prove the following claim:
Claim 4.7. Under an event-base lockdown, for any n ≥ ne and for any s1 > s2 ,
ρ(s2 , n)
ρ(s1 , n)
>
.
ρL (s1 , n)
ρL (s2 , n)

(33)

Proof of Claim 4.7. When the lockdown begins, we have:
ρ(s, nb ) = ρL (s, nb ).

(34)

For any nb ≤ n ≤ ne ,
ρ(s, n) ≈ R
and
ρL (s, n) ≈ R

ρ(s, nb ) · exp (−β(nb , n) · (p · s))
ρ(σ, nb ) · exp (−β(nb , n) · (p · σ)) dσ

ρL (s, nb ) · exp (−βL (nb , n) · (p · s))
.
ρL (σ, nb ) · exp (−βL (nb , n) · (p · σ)) dσ

(35)

(36)

The ratio between the density functions is:
ρ(s, n)
ρ(s, nb ) exp (−β(nb , n) · (p · s))
ρL (σ, n) · exp (−βL (nb , n) · (p · σ)) dσ
=
·

.
ρL (s, n)
ρL (s, nb ) exp (−βL (nb , n) · (p · s))
ρ(σ, n) · exp (−β(nb , n) · (p · σ)) dσ
R

Hence:

ρ(s, n)
= exp(p · s · (βL (nb , n) − β(nb , n)) · c
ρL (s, n)
R

ρL (σ,ne )·exp(−βL (nb ,ne )·(p·σ))dσ
where c = R ρ(σ,n )·exp(−β(n ,n )·(p·σ))dσ . We establish the following claim.
e

e

Claim 4.8. For any nb < n ≤ ne ,
βL (nb , n) > β(nb , n).
Proof of Claim 4.8. We will prove the claim using induction on n.
18

(37)

• (Base case). Since qL = 0 ( < q) we have that: SLnb (a) < S nb (a) for any a. Hence,
βL (nb , nb + 1) > β(nb , nb + 1).
• (Inductive step). Let n ∈ (nb , ne ). Assume that
βL (nb , n) > β(nb , n).
By Eq. (37), for any s1 > s2 ,
ρ(s1 , n)
ρ(s2 , n)
>
,
ρL (s1 , n)
ρL (s2 , n)
and using Claim 4.6,
E[SLn (a)] < E[S n (a)]
Using the definition of β and by our assumption,
βL (nb , n + 1) > β(nb , n + 1).
we conclude that for any nb < n ≤ ne , βL (nb , n) < β(nb , n).



Next, we apply Claim 4.8 for ne and have that βL (nb , ne ) − β(nb , ne ) > 0. Therefore, by
Eq. (37) for any s1 > s2
ρ(s1 , ne )
ρ(s2 , ne )
>
,
(38)
ρL (s1 , ne )
ρL (s2 , ne )
and according to Claim 4.6, RL (ne ) < R(ne ), where R and RL are calculated using the original
values of p and q. This is demonstrated in Figure 6.
In a similar develop as in Eq. (37), we have that for any n > ne ,
ρ(s, n)
= exp(p · s · ((βL (nb , ne ) + βL (ne , n)) − (β(nb , ne ) + β(ne , n))) · c · c0 .
ρL (s, n)
where

(39)

R

ρL (σ,n)·exp(−βL (ne ,n)·(p·σ))dσ
= R ρ(σ,n)·exp(−β(n ,n)·(p·σ))dσ . We establish the following claim, similar to Claim
e

Claim 4.9. For any ne < n,
βL (ne , n) > β(ne , n).
Proof of Claim 4.9. The proof follows the same idea of the proof of Claim 4.8.The full proof
is given in Appendix A.

We conclude the proof of the claim using Claim 4.9 and Eq. (39). It holds that ∀s1 > s2 ,
∀n ≥ ne ,
ρ(s1 , n)
ρ(s2 , n)
>
.
ρL (s1 , n)
ρL (s2 , n)

a natural evolution) assuming p = 0.5, R0 = 3 and k = 0.1. The lockdown begins at nb = 5%
and ends at ne = 30%.
Proof of Theorem 4.4. Combining Claim 4.7 with Claim 4.6 we have that for any n ≥ ne :
RL (n) < R(n).
Consequently, HITL < HIT , and Theorem 4.4 follows.

(40)


.
Note that the proof of Theorem 4.4 was not based on the assumption that qL = 0, but on
the fact that qL < q (see the proof of Claim 4.8). Hence, Theorem 4.4 can be generalized to
hold for any 0 ≤ qL < q, namely for Partial Lockdown.
Corollary 4.10 (Generalization of Theorem 4.4). Any event-based spreading targeted partial
lockdown, namely where p remains at the same level and qL < q, results in HITL < HIT .
Remark 4.11 (Generalization of Theorem 4.3). We conjecture that the generalization of Theorem 4.3 for personal-trait spreading targeted partial lockdown holds as well.

Conclusions and Discussion

In this work we studied the effects of infectiousness heterogeneity (overdispersion) and lockdowns on herd immunity. Recent literature suggests that COVID-19 is characterized by such
heterogeneity which affects dramatically herd immunity. We proposed that infectiousness (and
susceptibility) should be classified into two inherently different types which we called personaltrait and event-based spreading.
We followed up [8] and proposed a model that accounts for both of these types. Under this
new model we showed that herd immunity and the HIT strongly depend on the mix between the
two types of spreading. We analyzed the decay of the effective reproduction number, R(), and
showed that the contribution of the personal-trait spreading drops sharply at early stages of the
disease while the contribution of the event-based spreading drops much more slowly. That is the super-spreaders ”leave the game” at early stages, while the super-spreading events remain
active.
We demonstrated the results on a (Gamma) distribution which previously attributed to
the infectiousness of COVID-2 [5] and COVID-19 [3, 8]. We showed that in order to predict
the mix between the spreading types, only a small fraction of the population is needed to get
infected. Such prediction can help in calculating the HIT in an early stage of the disease. This
estimation problem for COVID-19 is left open for forthcoming research.
We addressed operational aspects of disease blocking and analyzed the effect of lockdowns
on the HIT. We showed that different lockdown strategies, targeting different spreading types,
result in opposite effect on the HIT. In particular, a lock-down which targets personal-trait
spreading would act adversely and reduces herd immunity. This seems to fit a lockdown that
focuses on daily/professional activities. In contrast, a lock-down which targets event-based
spreading will increase herd immunity. This may fit a lockdown that focuses on sports/social
events.
Of course, a lockdown may have other objectives such as achieving temporary slow down of
the disease spreading (to allow handling the patients masses) which may justify the lockdown
strategy. Yet – the effect on herd immunity requires consideration, especially due to the
opposite effects of various lockdowns.

Proofs

Proof of Claim 3.2 (continued). The proof follows the proof of Claim I provided in [8]. Taking
natural log of Eq. (13),
log(Pr[a is healthy at round n]) − log(Pr[a is healthy at round n − 1]) =
S n−1 (a)
= log 1 −
.
N (n − 1) · Eb∼Hn−1 [S n−1 (b)]

It holds that:

We attempt to find the herd-immunity threshold, and hence can bound number of steps, n, by
(1 − 1/R0 ) · N0 . Hence,

Since our calculation is done by taking an expectation over all possible scenarios of infections,
we have:

Hence,
Pr[a is healthy at round n] ≈ exp (−β(n) · (p · Sp (a) + q · λS ))
and the proof is complete.

Proof of Claim 4.6. Let s0 > 0. By our assumption, for any s < s0 :
ρ2 (s0 )ρ1 (s) > ρ2 (s)ρ1 (s0 ).
Hence, integrating s over (0, s0 ) we have:
Z s0
0

ρ2 (s0 )ρ1 (s) − ρ2 (s)ρ1 (s0 )ds > 0.

Therefore:
ρ2 (s0 )P1 (s0 ) =

Z s0
0

ρ2 (s0 )ρ1 (s)ds >

Z s0
0

ρ2 (s)ρ1 (s0 )ds = P2 (s0 )ρ1 (s0 ).

(45)

By the same ideas we have that:
(1 − P2 (s0 ))ρ1 (s0 ) =

Z ∞
s0

ρ2 (s)ρ1 (s0 )ds >

Z ∞
s0

ρ2 (s0 )ρ1 (s)ds = ρ2 (s0 )(1 − P1 (s0 )).

(46)

Using Eq. (45) and Eq. (46) we have:
1 − P2 (s0 )
ρ2 (s0 )
P2 (s0 )
>
>
1 − P1 (s0 )
ρ1 (s0 )
P1 (s0 )
and hence:
∀s, P2 (s) < P1 (s).

(47)

Since r is an injective monotone function, it holds that:
Pr[S1 > s0 ] = Pr[r(S1 ) > r(s0 )].

(48)

Pr[S2 > s0 ] = Pr[r(S2 ) > r(s0 )].

(49)

In the same way:
Using Eq. (47) combined with Eq. (48) and 49):
Pr[r(S1 ) > r(s0 )] < [r(S2 ) > r(s0 )].

24

(50)

For any non-negative random variable X it holds that:
E[X] =

Z ∞
0

1 − FX (s)ds.

(51)

Therefore, by Eq. (50) combined with 51 we know that:
E[r(S1 )] ≤ E[r(S2 )].
And the proof is complete.

Proof of Claim 4.9. We will prove the claim using induction on n.
• (Base case). Using Eq. (38), we have that:
E[SLne (a)] < E[S ne (a)].
Hence,
βL (ne , ne + 1) > βL (ne , ne + 1).
• (Inductive step). Let ne < n. Assume that
βL (ne , n) > β(ne , n).
By Claim 4.8 and Eq. (39), for any s1 > s2 ,
ρ(s1 , n)
ρ(s2 , n)

ρL (s1 , n)
ρL (s2 , n)
and using Claim 4.6,
E[SLn (a)] < E[S n (a)]
Using the definition of β and by our assumption,
βL (ne , n + 1) > β(ne , n + 1).
we conclude that for any ne < n, βL (ne , n) < β(ne , n).
