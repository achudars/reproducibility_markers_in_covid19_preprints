Abstract
The pandemic of COVID-19 has caused severe public health consequences around
the world. Many interventions of COVID-19 have been implemented. It is of great
public health and societal importance to evaluate the effects of interventions in the pandemic of COVID-19. In this paper, with help of synthetic control method, regression
discontinuity and a Susceptible-Infected and infectious without isolation-Hospitalized
in isolation-Removed (SIHR) model, we evaluate the horizontal and longitudinal effects of stringent interventions implemented in Wenzhou, a representative urban city
of China, where stringent interventions were enforced to curb its own epidemic situation
with rapidly increasing newly confirmed cases. We found that there were statistically
significant treatment effects of those stringent interventions which reduced the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. Those reduction effects would increase over time.
Also, if the stringent interventions were delayed by 2 days or mild interventions were
implemented instead, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have
been nearly 2 times or 5 times of the actual number. The effects of stringent interventions are significant in mitigating the epidemic situation of COVID-19. The slower the
interventions were implemented, the more severe the epidemic would have been, and
the stronger the interventions would have been required.

INTRODUCTION

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as an acute infection has rapidly spread over 200
countries in the world since December 2019 (World Health Organization, 2020). There were
2,804,799 reported cumulative confirmed cases and 193,711 cumulative deaths around the
world and 84,341 cumulative confirmed cases and 4,643 cumulative deaths from China until
April 26 , 2020 (National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, 2020b).
These numbers are rapidly arising daily. This coronavirus family includes the virus that
caused to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and another that caused
to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (Zhu et al., 2020). Early cases of
COVID-19 suggested that it might not be as severe as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but
the rapid increase in confirmed cases and the evidence of human-to-human transmission
indicated that this coronavirus was more contagious than both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
(Wang et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020).
Compared with the outbreak of SARS, the Chinese government mounted responses
rapidly to contain COVID-19 by reducing the risk of personal exposure and transmission (Tu
et al., 2020). As the city with the largest number of confirmed cases in Zhejiang province
(National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, 2020a), where it activated
the first-level public health emergency response on January 23, 2020, Wenzhou had suspended all inter-provincial and inter-city shuttle buses, and chartered buses, and carried out
temperature testing for passengers of buses arriving in Wenzhou as its own policies to deal
with the epidemic situation since January 27, 2020 (Wenzhou Municipal People’s Government, 2020a). These strict control measures were implemented across Wenzhou, where one
family member was assigned to go out for necessity purchase of each household every two
days since February 1, 2020 (Wenzhou Municipal People’s Government, 2020b). Thus, Wenzhou had adopted the stringent intervention policies, including both traffic blockade inside
and outside the city, and the strictly closed management of the community, to intensively
prevent and control of the epidemic situation of COVID-19. In addition, an industrial city
of Guangdong province, which activated the first-level public health emergency response on

3

January 23, 2020 (Health Commission of Guangdong Province, 2020), Shenzhen adopted
closely following the close contact of confirmed cases and isolating them on the same time.
Comparatively, Shenzhen implemented relatively mild but early interventions.
This paper concentrated on the strict intervention policies of COVID-19 that started on
February 1, 2020 in Wenzhou and evaluated the treatment effects of those strict interventions,
providing insights into the effects of the strict interventions. We also assessed what could
have happened in Wenzhou if the stringent interventions were delayed by 0 to 5 days or
if mild interventions were implemented instead. We accomplished this through simulation
by using the time-varying Susceptible-Infected and infectious without isolation-Hospitalized
in isolation-Removed (SIHR) model (Tan et al., 2020). Finally, we simulated the likely
outcomes if relatively mild interventions as used in Shenzhen, China, were implemented in
lieu of the stringent interventions.
In the next section, we describe the classical causal effects methods and dynamic transmission models of COVID-19 in detail. The corresponding analysis of epidemic data in
Wenzhou are illustrated in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the effects of stringent interventions of COVID-19.

METHODOLOGIES

2.1 Data collection
We compiled a total of 504 confirmed cases (Health Commission of Wenzhou, 2000) from
January 21, 2020 when the confirmed cases were first reported, to February 25, 2020 when no
newly reported confirmed cases had been reported for a week, from the official website of the
health commission of Wenzhou, and obtained the residential population of Wenzhou from
the 2019 statistical yearbook of the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Statistics (Statistics Bureau of Zhejiang Province, 2019). The total confirmed cases of Shenzhen during the same
period were collected. The cases per 100,000 individuals were calculated by the prevalence
of COVID-19 multiplying 100,000 individuals in Wenzhou. We searched the daily number
of cumulative confirmed cases in each city of China using the R package ”nCov2019” (Wu
4

et al., 2020), and collected the number of cumulative confirmed cases from the top 100 cities
for the epidemic of COVID-19 (except Hubei province) on February 25, 2020. The corresponding population density and GDP per capita statistics of these 100 cities were obtained
from their latest statistical yearbooks.
2.2 Synthetic Control Method
To identify the treatment effects of the highly stringent interventions implemented on February 1, 2020, we compared Wenzhou with cities without those interventions. The synthetic
control method was used to construct a data-driven control-group in the absence of those interventions in Wenzhou (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003; Abadie et al., 2010). The observed
cases per 100,000 for Wenzhou (active intervention city) at the time t with interventions
were denoted by Y1t1 , and cases per 100,000 for cities j at the time t without interventions
by Yjt0 . The difference of Y1t1 − Y1t0 was the treatment effect of the interventions on the cases
per 100,000 for the active intervention city in the post-interventions period. Note that Y1t0
is counterfactual for the active intervention city in the post-interventions period. Reliable
estimates of cases per 100,000 for a synthetic intervention city were used to derive Y1t1 − Y1t0 ,
where a synthetic intervention city resembled the active intervention city by possible preinterventions characteristics. We selected the GDP per-capita (Zhang et al., 2020), population density (Oto-Peralı́as, 2020), and three-day cases per 100,000 before the implementation
of interventions to construct a resembling city of Wenzhou. The effects of unobserved factors
varied over time and were controlled by the linear combination of cases per 100,000 of preinterventions (Abadie et al., 2010). Thus, the treatment effect of interventions in Wenzhou
was formulated as (Abadie et al., 2011):
Y1t1

−

Y1t0

=

Y1t1

−

J+1
X

wj∗ Yjt0 .

(2.1)

To determine J, the number of cities demographically similar to Wenzhou, we selected
the top 100 cities of cumulative confirmed cases on February 25, 2020 in China (except
Hubei province) and used hierarchical clustering (Ward Jr, 1963) to group those cities based
on population density and GDP per capita. A homogenous group including Wenzhou and
5

other J cities were grouped together. Thus, those J cities could be considered as highly
resembling to Wenzhou. The sum of weights for each of J cities was 1 and the values of
weights in Equation (2.1) were determined by pre-interventions characteristics. The placebo
tests were used to identify the magnitude of the treatment effect (i.e. the causal effect of
interventions) (Abadie et al., 2010).
2.3 Regression Discontinuity
For the strict intervention policies of Wenzhou, we vertically compared the difference in the
epidemic situation of COVID-19 before and after the implementation of such intervention
policies. Regression Discontinuity (RD) (Thistlethwaite and Campbell, 1960; Hahn et al.,
2001; Imbens and Lemieux, 2008) was used to evaluate whether the implementation of strict
intervention policies of Wenzhou on February 1, 2020 had a significant effect on its own
COVID-19 epidemic. The outcome of these stringent interventions was formulated as:
log yt = α0 + α1 ht + α2 (t − c) + α3 ht (t − c)k + εt

(2.2)

where the logarithmic transformation of the daily number of cumulative confirmed cases as
a response variable. The values of t include 1 to 36, representing the number of days starting
from January 21, 2020 as a rate variable in Equation (2.2) of RD, for example, the date
of February 1 was denoted as 12 of t. h is an indicator variable for the implementation of
the strict intervention policies in Wenzhou, given a value of 1 as the implementation of the
policies but a value of 0 as no implementation of the policies. This indicates that the values
are 0 and 1 before and after February 1, 2020 (including February 1 itself), respectively and
the subscript of t indicates the number of days as defined before. c is the number of days
corresponding to the cutoff-point whose value is 12, representing the policy implemented on
February 1, 2020. The values of k could be denoted as the k th order of interaction effect
between rate variable and policy. We compared the k th order of interaction effect item in
the Equation (2.2) by AIC.
In RD, to determine whether c is an obvious jump point, the plot of both the rate
variable and response variable was used to identify their relationship (Calonico et al., 2015a).
6

Different numbers of bins could be used to divide both the left-hand side and right-hand
side of the cutoff-point to small intervals. Thus, the scatter plot of both median values of
the rate variable and mean values of the response variable could be drawn (Calonico et al.,
2015b). The actual rate variables are weighted uniformly in each bin, and the fitted curves
of both the left-hand side and right-hand side are used to examine whether the cutoff-point
can be considered as a threshold.
2.4 Susceptible-Infected and infectious without isolation-Hospitalized in isolation-Removed
(SIHR) model
The dynamic system of SIHR with four classes: Susceptible (S), infected and infectious
without isolation (I), hospitalized in isolation (H), removed (R) (Li, 2018; Hsieh et al.,
2004; Tan et al., 2020) was defined as:
I(t)
dS(t)
= −α
S(t),
dt
N
dI(t)
I(t)
=α
S(t) − βI(t),
dt
N
dH(t)
= βI(t) − γH(t),
dt
dR(t)
= γH(t),
dt
N = S(t) + I(t) + H(t) + R(t),

(2.3)

where the transmission rate α is the average rate of being infected given contact over unit
time, 1/β is the mean of the incubation period, 1/γ is the mean of the hospitalization period.
To consider the effects of interventions, we introduced the time-varying transmission rate,
which was defined as (Tan et al., 2020):
αα0 ,d,m (t) =

α0
,
1 + exp(λm (t − d − m/2))

(2.4)

where α0 denotes the maximum transmission rate of COVID-19 during the early outbreak,
d represents the time when the interventions start to be effective and the transmission rate
starts to decline, m is the duration of a process where the epidemic is to nearly vanish, λm
is selected as (2 log((1 − ε)/ε))/m and ε is specified to be 0.01. The smaller the values of d
7

and m, the earlier effectiveness and the stronger intensity of interventions were implemented,
respectively. We simulated the likely outcomes of delaying stringent interventions from 0 to
5 days by changing the values of d and of mild interventions on the same starting time of
Wenzhou policies by changing the value of m to Shenzhen policies.

CASE STUDY

3.1 Synthetic Control Method Analysis
We selected the top 100 cities outside Hubei province according to the cumulative confirmed
cases on February 25, 2020 (Table 1 in the Supplementary Materials). Based on the per
capita GDP and population density of each city, these cities (including Wenzhou) were
clustered into 4 groups using hierarchical clustering. Among them, a homogenous group
consisted of Wenzhou and other 45 cities (Figure 1 in the Supplementary Materials), where
Taizhou of Zhejiang province implemented similar policies to Wenzhou and was excluded
from our analysis. The remaining 44 cities formed a counterfactual city resembling Wenzhou
(Table 2 in the Supplementary Materials).
Before the strict interventions were implemented on February 1, 2020, the trends of actual
cases per 100,000 in both Wenzhou and ”synthetic Wenzhou” were highly similar, suggesting
that this synthetic city can be used to estimate the ”counterfactual” results of Wenzhou.
After 2 days of the implementation of the policies, the growth rate of actual cases per 100,000
in Wenzhou remarkably slower than that of ”synthetic Wenzhou”. The number of cases per
100,000 in ”Synthetic Wenzhou” on February 25, 2020 was 10.32, which is 1.69 times the
actual Wenzhou (6.08) (Figure 1). In other words, Wenzhou had not implemented the
strict interventions on February 1, 2020, the number of cumulative confirmed cases would
have reached 954 on February 25, 2020, i.e., the epidemic of COVID-19 in Wenzhou would
have expanded to approximately 1.7 times.

line indicated 2 days delay of implementation of the intervention policies in Wenzhou.

A placebo test was performed to determine the significance level of the difference in the
trends of COVID-19 cases per 100,000. To this end, we plotted the gap curves between
Wenzhou and synthetic Wenzhou by in turn exchanging Wenzhou and one of each 44 cities
in the homogenous group of Wenzhou. The gap of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 between
Wenzhou and our synthetic Wenzhou was the largest compared to the rest, i.e. the negative
9

effect of the intervention policies on COVID-19 per 100,000 in Wenzhou was the lowest
of all. For those 44 cities, the probability of having a gap for Wenzhou under a random
permutation of the control measures was 5%, which is conventionally regarded as statistically
significant. This suggested that the effect of the implementation of the policies in Wenzhou
was significantly different from the implementation of the policies in the remaining 44 cities,
indicating that the strict interventions of Wenzhou might have significantly reduced the
COVID-19 cases per 100,000 (Figure 2).

3.2 Regression Discontinuity Analysis
The values of AIC for each regression discontinuity model for different k th order of interaction
effects between rate variable and policy were shown in Table 1.

Looking at Table 1, the model included item P olicy*T ime3 (ht (t − c)3 ) had the lowest
value of AIC but it had more parameters (df = 7). Also, the slopes of the fitted curves
between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the cutoff-point were different (Figure
3). The points lied on the right-hand side of quadratic curve. Thus, RD could be used
to examine the treatment effect of interventions implemented in Wenzhou and the model
included the second order of interaction effects between policy and rate variable was reasonable. The coefficient of interventions is -0.350 (p-value: 0.003) and the interaction effect
between interventions and time is -0.438 (p-value: <0.001) indicating that there was a significant treatment effect of highly stringent interventions implemented in Wenzhou on February
1, 2020 (Table 2).

3.3 Simulation of stringent interventions delay or mild interventions instead
Our simulation projected that the expected cumulative confirmed cases would be 1.84 times
of the actual cases for a 2-day delay, 2.45 times for a 3-day delay, 3.26 times for a 4-day
delay and 4.30 times for a 5-day delay on February 25, 2020. The corresponding 95%
credible interval (CI) for these projected numbers of cases were presented in Table 3. The
14

full simulation results from January 21 to February 25, 2020 are presented in Figure 2 of
the Supplementary Materials. According to Table 3, the expected cumulative confirmed
cases for 0-day delay (i.e. the predicted cumulative confirmed cases) was very close to the
actual cumulative confirmed cases of Wenzhou. The expected cumulative confirmed cases
were 925 with corresponding 95% CI (571,1547) for the 2-day delay, 1233 with corresponding
95% CI (702,2233) for the 3-day delay, 1644 with corresponding 95% CI (851,3171) for the
4-day delay, and 2167 with corresponding 95% CI (1034, 4578) for the 5-day delay. The
observed cumulative confirmed cases had been stable since February 17, 2020, however,
the expected cumulative confirmed continued to increase if the stringent interventions were
delayed. Based on Figure 1, if the stringent interventions were delayed by 2 days or more,
the epidemic of COVID-19 in Wenzhou could have been more severe than that in synthetic
Wenzhou (954 cumulative confirmed cases on February 25, 2020). If the mild interventions
as those implemented in Shenzhen were implemented in Wenzhou on February 1, 2020, the
expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been 2319 with corresponding
95% CI (1145,5189) on February 25, 2020 (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION

We used daily reported cumulative confirmed case data from January 21 to February 25,
2020 in Wenzhou. By using the synthetic control method, the trend of COVID-19 cases
per 100,000 for the synthetic Wenzhou as a control group of no intervention were compared
with those for Wenzhou as a treatment group with interventions. The COVID-19 cases per

17

100,000 in Wenzhou were significantly lower than those in synthetic Wenzhou after February
3, 2020. This indicated that the implementation of the strict interventions on February 1,
2020 in Wenzhou had a significant effect on controlling the epidemic of COVID-19.
By using regression discontinuity analysis, we also concluded that the implementation of
strict intervention policies had a significant treatment effect on the epidemic in Wenzhou.
Moreover, the statistical treatment effects were evaluated. That is, since the intervention
policies were implemented in Wenzhou (corresponding coefficient of policy : -0.350), the
growth rate of the reported cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reduced, and
this ”reduction” effect would increase over time (corresponding coefficient of interaction
between time and policy: -0.438). Conversely, if the policies were not implemented, the
reported cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 would increase over time (corresponding
coefficient of time: 0.511).
The horizontal and longitudinal comparisons were made to examine the treatment effects
of the strict intervention policies implemented in Wenzhou, including the suspension of public
transportation in the city, the closure of highway junctions, and strict community access
control. Since January 21, 2020, compared with other cities outside Hubei province, the
number of reported cumulative confirmed cases in Wenzhou had been consistently in the top
two places, i.e., its COVID-19 epidemic situation was relatively severe. If strict intervention
policies were not implemented, the outbreak of COVID-19 would be expected to expand
to 1.7 times. Therefore, it can be concluded from the results of the two methods that the
strict intervention policies in Wenzhou, where the epidemic was severe, had significantly
suppressed its epidemic situation.
Based on our simulation, if the stringent interventions were delayed by a few days, such as
2 days, the epidemic situation would have been remarkably more severe, where the expected
number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been nearly 2 times of the actual number
of cases on February 25, 2020. If the mild interventions were implemented in lieu of the
stringent interventions, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been
4.60 times of the actual number of cases on February 25, 2020. Overall, if the stringent

18

interventions were delayed or the mild interventions were implemented instead, though on
the same day, the expected cumulative confirmed cases would have continued to increase
while the actual epidemic situation was under control in the Wenzhou.
