The ongoing novel coronavirus epidemic has been announced a pandemic by the World Health
Organization on March 11, 2020, and the Govt. of India has declared a nationwide lockdown
from March 25, 2020, to prevent community transmission of COVID-19. Due to absence of specific
antivirals or vaccine, mathematical modeling play an important role to better understand the disease
dynamics and designing strategies to control rapidly spreading infectious diseases. In our study, we
developed a new compartmental model that explains the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We
calibrated our proposed model with daily COVID-19 data for the four Indian provinces, namely
Jharkhand, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Chandigarh. We study the qualitative properties of the
model including feasible equilibria and their stability with respect to the basic reproduction number
R0 . The disease-free equilibrium becomes stable and the endemic equilibrium becomes unstable
when the recovery rate of infected individuals increased but if the disease transmission rate remains
higher then the endemic equilibrium always remain stable. For the estimated model parameters,
R0 > 1 for all the four provinces, which suggests the significant outbreak of COVID-19. Shorttime prediction shows the increasing trend of daily and cumulative cases of COVID-19 for the four
provinces of India.

In India, 173,763 confirmed cases, 7,964 confirmed new cases and 4,971 confirmed deaths due
to COVID-19 were reported as of May 30, 2020.
As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak is quickly
spreading throughout India and globe, short-term
modeling predictions give time-critical statistics
for decisions on containment and mitigation policies. A big problem for short-term prediction
is the evaluation of important parameters and
how they alter when the first interventions reveal an effect. In the absence of any therapeutics
or licensed vaccine, antivirals, isolation of populations diagnosed with COVID-19 and quarantine of populations feared exposed to COVID-19
were used to control the rapid spread of infection. During this alarming situation, forecasting
is of utmost priority for health care planning and
to control the SARS-CoV-2 virus with limited
resources. We proposed a mathematical model
that monitors the dynamics of six compartments,
namely susceptible (S), asymptomatic (A), reported symptomatic (I), unreported symptomatic
(U), quarantine (Q), and recovered (R) individuals, collectively termed SAIUQR, that predicts
the course of the epidemic. Our SAIUQR model
discriminates between reported and unreported
infected individuals, which is important as the
former are typically isolated and hence less likely
to spread the infection. A detailed theoretical

analysis has been done for our SAIUQR model
in terms of the basic reproduction number R0 .
All the analytical findings are verified numerically for the estimated model parameters. We
have calibrated our SAIUQR model with real observed data on the COVID-19 outbreak in the
four provinces of India. The basic reproduction number for all the provinces is greater than
unity, which resulted in a substantial outbreak
of COVID-19. Based on the simulation, our
SAIUQR model predict that on June 13, 2020,
the daily new COVID-19 cases will be around 15,
454, 12, 96, and cumulative number of COVID19 cases will be around 661, 23955, 514, 4487,
in Jharkhand, Gujarat, Chandigarh and Andhra
Pradesh, respectively.

INTRODUCTION

After a novel strain of COVID-19, was detected in
Wuhan, the city of Hubei province, China, in December 2019 [1], an exponentially increasing number of patients in mainland China were identified with SARSCoV-2, immediately the Chinese Health authorities to
initiate radical measures to control the epidemic coronavirus. In spite of these radical measures, a SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus pandemic ensued in the subsequent months
and China became the epicenter. SARS-CoV-2 viruses
are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses
that belong to the Coronaviridae family and the order
Nidovirales, and are extensively disseminated among humans as well as mammals [2]. The COVID-19 is re-

2
sponsible for a range of symptoms together with fever,
dry cough, breathing difficulties, fatigue and lung infiltration in severe cases, similar to those created by
SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infections [3]. SARS-CoV-2 has already crossed the earlier history of two coronavirus epidemics SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, posing the substantial threat to the world people health problem as well as
economical problem after the second world war [4]. According to the World Health Organization report, dated
29 May 2020 reported 5,596,550 total cases and 353,373
deaths worldwide [5].
Till date, there is no licensed vaccine, drugs and effective therapeutics available for SARS-CoV-2 or COVID19. Due to absence of pharmaceutical interventions,
Govt. of various countries are adopting different strategies to control the outbreak and the most common one
is the nation-wide lockdown. It was started with the
local Govt. of Wuhan by temporarily prevention of all
public traffics within the city on January 23, 2020 and
soon followed by other cities in Hubei province [6]. In
the absence of drug or specific antivirals for SARS-CoV2 viruses, maintaining social distancing is the only way
to mitigate the human-to-human transmission for coronavirus diseases, and thus the other countries also incorporated the strict lockdown, quarantines and curfews.
In India, the first coronavirus case was reported in Kerala’s Thrissur district on January 30, 2020 when a student returned back from Wuhan, the sprawling capital
of China’s Hubei province [7]. The Govt. of India has
implemented a complete nationwide lockdown throughout the country on and from March 25, 2020 for 21 days,
following one day ‘Janata Curfew’ on March 22, 2020 to
control the coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in India [8]. Due to massive spread of coronavirus diseases,
the Govt. of India has extended the lockdown and it is
going on Phase 4; from May 18, 2020 to May 31, 2020.
Besides the implementation of nationwide lockdown, the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) of India, recommended different individual hygiene measures,
for example, frequent hand washing, social distancing,
use of mask, avoid gathering and touching eyes, mouth
and nose etc. [9].
The Govt. also ceaselessly using different media and
social network to aware the public regarding coronavirus
diseases and its precautions. Albeit, the factors such as
diverse and huge population, the unavailability of specific therapeutics, drugs or licensed vaccines, inadequate
evidences regarding the mechanism of disease transmission make it strenuous to combat against the coronavirus diseases throughout India. To control the transmission of COVID-19, lockdown is a magnificent measure
but testing is also an important factor to identify the
symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The symptomatic individuals should be reported by the public
health agencies to separate them from the uninfected or
asymptomatic individuals for their ICU (Intensive Care

Unit) treatment. Also, from an economic viewpoint, the
strict lockdown may be the cause of a substantial financial crisis in near future. In particular, the lockdown in
high dense countries can mitigate the disease transmission rate, although entirely control not be obtainable.
Thus, to survive the economical status of a country, a
strict lockdown for a long period is not advisable at all
in any situations. Hence there should be a acceptable
balance between the two different characteristics of governmental strategies: strict lockdown and healthy economical situations. Albeit, few questions remains to answer whether this cluster containment policy can be effective in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission or not ?
If not then what can be the possible solutions to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 viruses ? These
questions can only be replied by investigating the dynamics and forecasting of a mechanistic compartmental
model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and comparing the
outcomes with real scenarios.
A plenty of mathematical models has been investigated to study the transmission dynamics and forecasting of COVID-19 outbreak [10–20]. Kucharski and colleagues [10] performed a model-based analysis for SARSCoV-2 viruses and calculate the reproduction number
R0 = 2.35, where the authors have taken into account all
the positive cases of Wuhan, China, till March 05, 2020.
Wu and colleagues [12] studied a susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered (SEIR) model to simulate the epidemic in Wuhan city and compute the basic reproduction number R0 = 2.68 and predict their model based on
the data recorded from December 31, 2019 to January
28, 2020. Tang and colleagues [11] developed a compartmental model to study the transmission dynamics of
COVID-19 and calculate the basic reproduction number
R0 = 6.47, which is very high for the infectious diseases.
Recently, Fanelli & Piazza [13] analyzed and predicted
the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the three
mostly affected countries till March 2020 with an aid of
the mathematical modeling. Stochastic based regression
model also been studied by Ribeiro and Colleagues [14]
to predict the scenarios of the most affected states of
Brazil. Chakraborty & Ghosh [15] investigate a hybrid
ARIMA-WBF model to predict the various SARS-CoV2 affected countries throughout the world. Khajanchi
and Colleagues [18] developed a compartmental model
to forecast and control of the outbreak of COVID-19 in
the four states of India and the overall India. Sarkar
& Khajanchi [16] developed a mathematical model to
study the model dynamics and forecast the SARS-CoV-2
viruses in seventeenth provinces of India and the overall India. A discrete-time SIR model introducing dead
compartment system studied by Anastassopoulou et al.
[19] to portray the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Giordano and colleagues [20] established a new mathematical model for COVID-19 pandemic and predict that
restrictive social distancing can mitigate the widespread
of COVID-19 among the human. A couple of seminal
papers has been investigated to study the transmission

3
dynamics of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 viruses for different countries, including Mexico city, Chicago and Wuhan,
the sprawling capital of Central China’s Hubei province
[21–24]. Short-term prediction is too important as it
gives time-critical information for decisions on containment and mitigation strategies [18, 25]. A major problem
for short-term predictions is the evaluation of important
epidemiological parameters and how they alter when first
interventions reveal an effect.
The main objective of this work is to develop a new
mathematical model that describes the transmission dynamics and forecasting of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2
pandemic in the four different provinces of India, namely
Jharkahnd, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Gujarat.
We estimated the model parameters of four different
states of India and fitted our compartmental model to
the daily confirmed cases and cumulative confirmed cases
reported between March 15, 2020 to May 24, 2020. We
compute the basic reproduction number R0 for the four
different states based on the estimated parameter values.
We also perform the short-term predictions of the four
different states of India from May 25, 2020 to June 13,
2020, and it shows the increasing trends of COVID-19
pandemic in four different provinces of India.
The remaining part of this manuscript has been organized in the following way. In the Section 2, we describe
the formulation of the compartmental model for COVID19 and its basic assumptions. Section 3 describes the
theoretical analysis of the model, which incorporates the
positivity and boundedness of the system, computation
of the basic reproduction number R0 , existence of the
biologically feasible singular points and their local stability analysis. In the same section, we perform the global
stability analysis for the infection free equilibrium point
E 0 and the existence of transcritical bifurcation at the
threshold R0 = 1. In the Section 4, we conduct some
model simulations to validate our analytical findings by
using the estimated model parameters for Jharkhand, the
state of India. The parameters are estimated for the real
world example on COVID-19 for four different states of
India and perform a short-term prediction based on the
estimated parameter values. A discussion in the Section
5 concludes the manuscript.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL

A compartmental mathematical model has been developed to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19
outbreak in India and throughout the world. We adopt
a variant that focuses some important epidemiological
properties of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus diseases. Based on the health status, we stratify the total human population into six compartments, namely
susceptible or uninfected (S), asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic infected (A), symptomatic reported infected (I), unreported infected (U ), quarantine (Q), and
recovered (R) individuals, collectively termed SAIUQR.

At any instant of time, the total population is denoted
by N = S +A+I +U +Q+R. Depending on the six state
variables, we aim to develop an autonomous system using
first order nonlinear ordinary differential equations.
In the model formulation, quarantine refers to the separation of coronavirus infected population from the general population when the individuals are infected but
clinical symptoms has not yet developed, whereas isolation refers to the separation of coronavirus infected population when the population already identified the clinical
symptoms. Our mathematical model introduces some
demographic effects by assuming a proportional natural
mortality rate δ > 0 in each of the six compartments.
In addition, our model incorporates a constant recruitment of susceptible populations into the region at the
rate Λs per unit time. This parameter represents new
birth, immigration and emigration. The parameter βs
represents the probability of disease transmission rate.
However the disease transmission from vulnerable to infected individuals (for our model, the class is A) depend
on various factors, namely safeguard precautions (use of
mask, social distancing, etc.) and hygienic safeguard (use
of hand sanitizer) taken by the susceptible individuals as
well as infected population. In our model formulation,
we incorporate the asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic
infected (undetected) individuals, which is important to
better understand the transmission dynamics of COVID19, which also studied by Giordano et al. [20] and XiaoLin et al. [21].
In our model formulation, we assumed that the
COVID-19 virus is spreading when a vulnerable person come into contact with an asymptomatic infected
individuals. The uninfected individuals decreases after infection, obtained through interplays among a susceptible population and an infected individuals who
may be asymptomatic, reported symptomatic and unreported symptomatic. For these three compartments
of infected population, the transmission coefficients are
βs αa , βs αi , and βs αu respectively. We consider βs as
the disease transmission rate along with the adjustment
factors for asymptomatic αa , reported symptomatic αi
and unreported symptomatic αu individuals. The interplays among infected populations (asymptomatic, reported symptomatic, and unreported symptomatic) and
susceptible individuals can be modeled in the form of total individuals using standard mixing incidence [26–29].
The quarantined population can either move to the
susceptible or infected compartment (reported and unreported), depending on whether they are infected or not
[30], with a portion ρs . Here, γq is the rate at which
the quarantined uninfected contacts were released into
the wider community. Asymptomatic individuals were
exposed to the virus but clinical symptoms of SARSCoV-2 viruses has not yet developed. The asymptomatic
individuals decreases due to contact with reported and
unreported symptomatic individuals at the rate γa with
a portion θ ∈ (0, 1), and become quarantine at the rate
ξa . Also, the asymptomatic individuals become recov-

4
ered at the rate ηa and has a natural mortality rate δ.
A fraction of quarantine individuals become reported infected individuals at the rate γq with a portion ρs (where
ρs ∈ (0, 1)).
As we know that an individual is whether infected by
coronavirus diseases or not can be identified by RT-PCR
screening test and a person with negative results with the
RT-PCR screening test may yet be coronavirus positive
as it may take around 7-21 days to express the coronavirus symptoms [31]. Thus, a fraction of coronavirus
positive class can be considered as reported symptomatic
individuals (θ) and unreported symptomatic individuals
(1 − θ). The reported symptomatic individuals separated
from the general populations and move to the isolated
class or hospitalized class for clinical treatment.
Also, it can be noticed that once an individual recovered from the SARS-CoV-2 diseases has a very little
chance to become infected again for the same disease [31].
Therefore, we assume that none of the recovered individ-

uals move to the susceptible or uninfected class again. In
our mathematical model formulation, we assume that the
reported infected individuals (I) are unable to spread or
transmit the viruses as they are kept completely isolated
from the susceptible or uninfected individuals. As the
reported infected individuals are moved to the hospital
or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) [32]. For our modeling perspective, we are mainly interested in predictions over a
relatively short time window within which the temporary
immunity is likely still to be in placed, and the possibility
of reinfection would negligibly affect the total number of
uninfected populations and so there would be no considerable difference in the evolution of the epidemic curves
we consider. Social mixing patterns are introduced into
our contagion parameters in an average fashion over the
entire individuals, irrespective of age. Based on these
biological assumptions, we develop the following mathematical model using a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations to study the outbreak of COVID-19
or SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus diseases:

SAIUQR MODEL ANALYSIS

In this section, we provide the basic properties of the
SAIUQR model (1), including positivity and boundedness of the solutions, basic reproduction number and
the biologically feasible singular points and their stability analysis, subject to the non-negative initial values
(S0 , A0 , Q0 , I0 , U0 , Q0 , R0 ) ∈ R6 .
Theorem III.1 The solutions of the SAIUQR system
(1) with the initial values (2) are defined on R6+ remain
positive for all t > 0.

Basic reproduction number

In any infectious disease modeling, the basic reproduction number is the key epidemiological parameter for describing the characteristics of the diseases. The basic
reproduction number symbolized by R0 and is defined
as “the number of secondary infected individuals caused
by a single infected individuals in the entire susceptible
individuals” [33]. The dimensionless basic reproduction
number R0 quantifies the expectation of the disease die
out or the spreading of the diseases. For, R0 < 1 describes on an average an infected population spreads less
than a new infective during the course of its infection
period, and thus the diseases can die out. For, R0 > 1

used to compute the basic reproduction number R0 for
an epidemic outbreak. In our present study, we use the
next generation matrix to evaluate R0 [33]. In our compartmental model, the following classes are explicitly related to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus diseases:
A, I, U , and Q. Thus, from the SAIUQR model system

In the present subsection, we investigate the linear stability analysis for the SAIUQR model (1) for the two feasible steady states. By using the techniques of linearization, we investigate the local dynamics of the complicated
system of the coronavirus compartmental model. Generally, we linearize the SAIUQR model around each of
the feasible steady states and perturb the compartmental model by a very small amount, and observe whether
the compartmental model returns to that steady states
or converges to any other steady states or attractor.
The local stability analysis aids in understanding the
qualitative behavior of the complex nonlinear dynamical system. By using the following theorem, we prove
the local stability of the infection free singular point
E 0 (S 0 , A0 , Q0 , I 0 , U 0 , R0 ):

The basic reproduction number R0 = ρ(F V −1 ), where
ρ(F V −1 ) represents the spectral radius for a next gener-

Theorem III.4 The infection free steady state E 0 is
globally asymptotic stable for R0 < 1 in the bounded region Ω.

a locally asymptotic stable around the endemic equilibrium point E ∗ for R0 > 1. Also, the system (1) experiences forward bifurcation at R0 = 1.

NUMERICAL SIMULATION

In this section, we conduct some numerical illustrations
to validate our analytical findings. Analytically, we perform the local stability analysis for infection free steady
state E 0 and a unique endemic equilibrium point E ∗ . We
also perform the transcritical bifurcation at the threshold
R0 = 1 and the global stability analysis for disease-free
steady state E 0 . In order to validate the analytical calculations, we used the estimated parameter values for
Jharkhand, the state of India and the techniques for parameter estimation are described in the subsection IV A.

RMSE is the measure of the accuracy of the fitting data
and the RMSE is defined as follows:

where n represents the size of the observed data, O(i)
is the reported daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and
M (i) represents the model simulation. The Figure 2
shows the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases (first column), cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases (second
column) and model simulations has been shown in the
blue curve for all the four provinces of India. The values of RMSE and basic reproduction number R0 for all
the four provinces are presented in the inset of the figure. The SAIUQR model performs well for the three
provinces, namely Jharkhand, Chandigarh, and Andhra
Pradesh. The RMSE for Gujarat is higher than the other
provinces as the number of daily confirmed COVID-19
cases are higher than the other provinces. The value
of the basic reproduction number R0 for Jharkhand,
Gujarat, Chandigarh, and Andhra Pradesh are 1.6877,
1.8803, 1.4775, and 1.2435, respectively and the trend of
daily confirmed COVID-19 cases is increasing. This increasing trend of the daily new COVID-19 cases for all
the four provinces of India are captured by our model
simulation. In all the four provinces R0 > 1, so the
disease free equilibrium point E 0 is unstable. The basic reproduction number for the four states are greater
than unity, which indicates the substantial outbreak of
the COVID-19 in the states.

Model calibration
B.

We have calibrated our SAIUQR model (1) with the
observed daily new COVID-19 cases. We have considered three states of India namely Jharkahnd, Gujarat,
Andhra Pradesh and one city of India namely Chandigarh. The daily new COVID-19 cases are collected from
the first COVID-19 case reported and up to May 24,
2020. The daily reported COVID-19 data were obtained
from COVID19 INDIA (https://www.covid19india.org/)
[34]. We have estimated six model parameters, namely
βs , αa , αi , αu , γa and γq , out of fourteen system parameters for the system (1) by using least square method [35].
The values of these parameters and the initial population
size plays an important role in the model simulation. The
parameters are estimated by assuming the initial population size. The initial population are presented in the
Table III. Three days moving average filter has been applied to the daily COVID-19 cases to smooth the data.
The daily reported confirmed COVID-19 cases are fitted with the model simulation by using the least square
method. The estimated parameter values are listed in
the Table II. Different set of parameter values locally
minimizes the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and we
have considered the set of parameter values, which gives

Validation of analytical findings

In this section, we have validated our analytically findings by using numerical simulations for the parameter
values in the Table I, and the estimated parameter values
in the Table II for our SAIUQR model for the coronavirus diseases. The parameter values are estimated
for the observed COVID-19 data for the three states of
India, namely Jharkhand, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh
and for the city Chandigarh. Our analytical findings
stated in the Theorem III.3, shows that the disease free
equilibrium point E 0 is locally asymptotically stable
with R0 < 1, and the Theorem III.5 stated that a unique
endemic equilibrium point E ∗ is locally asymptotically
stable for R0 > 1. The numerical simulations of the
SAIUQR model system (1) have been presented in
the Figure 3 for all the six individuals and for the
different values of the disease transmission rate βs .
The value of the parameters considered for numerical
simulations are αa = 0.264, αi = 0.76, αu = 0.96,
γa = 0.0012, γq = 0.0015, δ = 0.03, Λs = 1200 and the
other model parameter values are listed in the Table
I. Six initial population sizes are considered for the
model simulation, namely (39402, 1500, 2000, 20, 0, 0),

(15000, 100, 50, 1, 0, 0). The time series simulation have
been displayed for βs = 1.10 (red curves in the Figure 3)
and βs = 0.55 (blue curves in the Figure 3). The values
of R0 are 1.2889 and 0.7030 for βs = 1.10 and βs = 0.55,
respectively. The blue curves in the Figure 3 shows that
the disease free equilibrium point E 0 (40000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
is locally asymptotically stable as well as globally asymptotically stable with R0 = 0.7030 < 1. Our SAIUQR
model system (1) converges to the endemic equilibrium
point E ∗ (31035.0, 1146.0, 17.6, 1.6, 2601.5, 5198.4) for
βs = 1.10 and R0 = 1.2889 > 1 (red curves), which has
been displayed in the Figure 3. Hence, this numerical
simulation verifies the analytical findings in Theorem
III.3 and Theorem III.5.
The Theorem III.5 states that the SAIUQR model
system (1) undergoes a transcritical bifurcation at the
threshold R0 = 1. We have plotted the COVID-19 reported symptomatic individuals (I) in the (R0 , I) plane
by gradually increasing the disease transmission rate βs
(see the Figure 4). The model parameter values are
αa = 0.264, αi = 0.76, αu = 0.96, γa = 0.0012,
γq = 0.0015, δ = 0.03, Λs = 1200 and the other parameter values listed in the Table I. We vary the disease
transmission rate βs from 0.67 to 1.10 and computed the
basic reproduction number R0 and the COVID-19 reported symptomatic individuals (I). The numerically
computed values are presented in the Figure 4, which
clearly shows that the system (1) experiences transcritical bifurcation at the threshold R0 = 1. The blue curve
represents the stable endemic equilibrium point E ∗ , black

line represents the stable disease free equilibrium point
E 0 and the red line represents the unstable branch of the
disease free equilibrium point E 0 . Hence, the Figure 4
shows that disease free equilibrium point E 0 is stable for
the reproduction number R0 < 1 and an endemic equilibrium point E ∗ is stable for the reproduction number
R0 > 1. From the biological point of view, it can be
described that the model system (1) will be free from
COVID-19 for the reproduction number R0 < 1 and the
coronavirus diseases will spread throughout the people
for R0 > 1.
Figure 5(a) represents the reproduction number R0
decreases as the recovery rate ηi of reported infected
individuals increases and the reproduction number R0
becomes less than one for βs = 0.85 and βs = 0.76.
This indicates that the disease free equilibrium point
E 0 switches the stability of the model system (1) as
ηi changes. But the reproduction number R0 remains
grater than one for the disease transmission rate βs =
1.10 and βs = 0.95, that is, for large βs unique endemic
equilibrium point remains locally asymptotically stable
even if ηi changes. In terms of COVID-19 diseases this
interprets that if the rate of recovery for infected individuals (ηi ) be increased, which can be done by vaccinees
or specific therapeutics, the model system (1) changes
its stability to disease free equilibrium E 0 from endemic
equilibrium E ∗ but if the transmission of the disease (βs )
is high enough then by vaccines or specific therapeutics,
the system (1) can not change its stability from endemic
equilibrium to disease free equilibrium.

Model Simulation

FIG. 2. Model estimation based on the observed data. Model simulations fitted with the daily new cases and the cumulative
confirmed cases of COVID-19 for four provinces of India, namely Jharkhand, Gujarat, Chandigarh, and Andhra Pradesh.
Observed data points are shown in the red circle while the blue curve represents the best fitting curve for the SAIUQR model.
The first column represents the daily new cases and the second column represents the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19.
The estimated parameter values are listed in the Table II and other parameter values are listed in the Table I. The initial values
used for this parameter values are presented in the Table III. The RMSE and the value of R0 for each provinces are mentioned
in the inset.

dividuals to symptomatic individuals) increases but the
reproduction number R0 remains less than one for the
disease transmission rate βs = 0.55 and βs = 0.45. For
βs = 0.66 and βs = 0.76, the basic reproduction number R0 becomes grater than one and the SAIUQR model
system (1) loses the stability of disease free equilibrium
point E 0 . Thus, to flatten the COVID-19 curve in any
of the four provinces of India, reduction of the transmission of the COVID-19 disease is utmost priority even if
the recovery rate increased by medication. Biologically it

means that to mitigate the COVID-19 diseases, the people must have to maintain the social distancing, contact
tracing by avoiding the mass gathering.
The predictive competency for the SAIUQR model system (1) requires valid estimation of the system parameters γa (rate of transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic infected individuals), γq (the rate that the quarantine become susceptible), θ (fraction of asymptomatic
infectious that become reported symptomatic infectious),
ξa (rate at which asymptomatic individuals become quar-

9
antined). In the Figure 6(a), we plot the reproduction
number R0 as a function of ξa and γq for the parameter
values in the Table I and estimated parameters for the
state Jharkhand, to encapsulate the significance of these
values in the evolution of COVID-19 outbreak. From
the Figure 6(a), it can be observed that the parameters
have a little influence on the outbreak of the coronavirus
diseases as the parameters ξa and γq has a little contribution for the reproduction number R0 . In the Figure
6(b), we plot the reproduction number R0 as a function
of θ and γa for the parameter values in the Table I and
estimated parameters for the state Jharkhand, to encapsulate the significance of these values in the evolution of
COVID-19 outbreak. The Figure 6(b) shows that the parameters θ and γa are more influential in increasing the
reproduction number R0 . Thus, to control the outbreak
of COVID-19, we must control the parameters θ and γa .
The correctness of these values rely on the input of medical and biological epidemiologists. Thus, the fraction θ of
reported symptomatic infected individuals may be substantially increased by public health reporting measures,
with greater efforts to recognize all the present cases. Our
model simulation reveals the effect of an increase in this
fraction θ in the value of the reproduction number R0 , as
evident in the Figure 6(b), for the COVID-19 epidemic
in the four sates of India.

Short-term prediction

Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases can provide short-term and long-term prediction of the pandemic
[16, 18, 20, 32]. Due to absence of any licensed vaccines
or specific therapeutics, forecasting is of utmost importance for strategies to control and prevention of the diseases with limited resources. It should be noted that here
we can predict the epidemiological traits of SARS-CoV-2
or COVID-19 for short-term only as the Governmental
strategies can be altered time to time resulting in the
corresponding changes in the associated parameters of
the proposed SAIUQR model. Also, it is true that the
scientists are working for drugs and/or effective vaccines
against COVID-19 and the presence of such pharmaceutical interventions will substantially change the outcomes
[36]. Thus, in this study we performed a short-term prediction for our SAIUQR model system (1) using the parameter values in the Table I and the estimated parameter values in the Table II. Using the observed data up to
May 24, 2020, a short-term prediction (for 20 days) has
been done for daily new COVID-19 cases (first column)
and cumulative confirmed cases (second column) are presented in the Figure 7. The black dot-dashed curve represents the short-term prediction of our SAIUQR model
from May 25, 2020 to June 13, 2020. Red shaded region
is the standard deviation band of our SAIUQR model
simulated curve. The standard deviations are computed
from the model simulation based on the estimated data.
In each of four states, we plot the standard deviation

bands at a standard deviation level above and below the
model simulation for different days. Standard deviation
band gives an estimation of the deviation of the actual
model data. The trend of the predicted daily COVID19 cases is increasing for all the four provinces of India.
Prediction of the SAIUQR model should be regarded as
an estimation of the daily infected population and cumulative confirmed cases of the four states of India. From
the SAIUQR model simulation, we can predict that the
estimated daily new reported COVID-19 cases on June
13, 2020 will be approximately 15, 454, 12, and 96 in
Jharkhand, Gujarat, Chandigarh, and Andhra Pradesh,
respectively (see the left column of the Figure 7). Our
SAIUQR model simulation predict that the confirmed
cumulative number of cases on June 13, 2020 will be
approximately 661, 23955, 514, and 4487 in Jharkhand,
Gujarat, Chandigarh, and Andhra Pradesh, respectively
(see the right column of the Figure 7).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in India is a potential
menace throughout the country due to its exponential
growth. Everyday the new cases are reported around 5-6
thousands and more than that from different states and
territories of India, which is an alarming situation as with
the second most populated country worldwide [34]. Due
to absence of any licensed vaccine, therapeutics or treatment and with a peculiar epidemiological traits of SARSCoV-2, one would depend on the qualitative control of

the diseases rather than complete elimination. During
this period of an epidemic when person-to-person transmission is confirmed and the reported cases of SARSCoV-2 viruses are rising throughout the globe, prediction is of utmost priority for health care planning and
to manage the virus with limited resource. Furthermore,
mathematical modeling can be a powerful tool in designing strategies to manage exponentially spreading coronavirus diseases in absence of any antivirals or diagnostic
test.
In this study, we proposed and analyzed a new compartmental mathematical model for SARS-CoV-2 viruses
to forecast and control the outbreak. In the model formulation, we incorporate the transmission variability of
asymptomatic and unreported symptomatic individuals.

We also incorporate the symptomatic infected populations who are reported by the public health services.
We assume that reported infected individuals will nolonger associated into the infection as they are isolated
and move to the hospitals or Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
In our model, we incorporate the constant transmission
rate in the early exponential growth phase of the SARSCoV-2 diseases as identified in [18, 29]. We model the
role of the Govt. imposed restrictions for the public in
India, beginning on March 25, 2020, as a time-dependent
decaying transmission rate after March 25, 2020. But,
due to less stringent lockdown exponentially increasing
the disease transmission rate, we are able to fit with increasing accuracy, our model simulations to the Indian
reported cases data up to May 24, 2020.

FIG. 4. The figure represents the transcritical bifurcation
diagram of the SAIUQR model system (1) with respect to
the basic reproduction number R0 . The parameter values are
αa = 0.264, αi = 0.76, αu = 0.96, γa = 0.0012, γq = 0.0015,
δ = 0.03, Λs = 1200 and other parameters as listed in the
Table I. Stability of the SAIUQR system (1) exchange at the
threshold R0 = 1.

We fit our SAIUQR model for the daily confirmed
cases and cumulative confirmed cases of the four different
provinces of India, namely Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh,
Chandigarh, and Gujarat with data up to May 24, 2020.
The estimated model parameters for different states of
India are given in the Table II and the corresponding
initial population size are listed in the Table III. It can
be observed that the basic reproduction number for four
different provinces of India, namely Jharkhand, Andhra
Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Gujarat are 1.6877, 1.2435,
1.4775, and 1.8830, respectively, which demonstrates the
disease transmission rate is quite high that basically indicates the substantial outbreak of the COVID-19 diseases.
This higher value of reproduction number R0 captures
the outbreak of COVID-19 phenomena in India. Based
on the estimated parameter values our model simulation
suggest that the rate of disease transmission need to be
controlled, otherwise India will enter in stage-3 of SARSCoV-2 disease transmission within in a short period of
time.
Based on the estimated model parameters we have
validated our detailed analytical findings. Our proposed SAIUQR model has two biologically feasible singular points, namely infection free steady state E 0 and a
unique endemic steady state E ∗ and they become locally
asymptotically stable for R0 < 1 and R0 > 1, respectively. Analytically, we have shown that the infection
free steady state E 0 of the SAIUQR model (1) is globally asymptotically stable for R0 < 1. We also showed
that the SAIUQR model (1) experiences transcritical bifurcation at the threshold parameter R0 = 1, which has
been shown in the Figure 4. The Figure 3 (blue curves)
and the Figure 3 (red curves) represents the local asymp-

totic stability as well as global asymptotic stability of the
infection free steady state E 0 for R0 < 1 and endemic
steady state E ∗ for R0 > 1, respectively.
The calibrated model then utilized for short-term
predictions in the four different states of India. Our
SAIUQR model performs well in case of all the four
provinces of India, namely Jharkahnd, Chandigarh, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh for daily confirmed cases and
cumulative confirmed cases. Albeit, the increasing (or
exponential) pattern of daily new cases and cumulative
confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 is well captured by our
proposed model for all the four states of India, which
has been shown in the Figure 2. Our model simulation
showed a short-term prediction for 20 days (from May
25, 2020 to June 13, 2020) for daily confirmed cases and
cumulative confirmed cases of the four provinces of India. The short-term prediction for the four provinces
of India will demonstrates the increasing pattern of the
daily and cumulative cases in the near future (see the
Figure 7). From the simulation, our model predict that
on June 13, 2020 the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19
of the four provinces of India, namely Jharkhand, Gujarat, Chandigarh, and Andhra Pradesh will be 15, 454,
12, and 96, respectively (see the left column of the Figure 7). Similarly, from the simulation, our model predict
that on June 13, 2020 the cumulative confirmed cases of
COVID-19 of the four provinces of India, namely Jharkhand, Gujarat, Chandigarh, and Andhra Pradesh will be
661, 23955, 514, and 4487, respectively (see the right column of the Figure 7).
It is worthy to mention that the scientists or clinicians are working for effective vaccine or therapeutics to
eradicate and/or control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2
diseases and the existence of such pharmaceutical interventions will substantially change the outcomes [36, 37].
Thus, in this study, we are mainly focusing on shortterm predictions for the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently there would be a very little chance to alter in
corresponding parametric space. But the framework of
our present compartmental model provides some significant insights into the dynamics and forecasting of the
spread and control of COVID-19. Moreover, our model
simulation suggest that the quarantine, reported and unreported symptomatic individuals as well as government
intervention polices like media effect, lockdown and social
distancing can play a key role in mitigating the transmission of COVID-19.

COMPETING INTERESTS

The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

Appendix A: Proof of Theorem III.1

Proof. To prove the positivity of the system (1), we
show that any solution initiating from the non-negative
octant R6+ remains positive for all t > 0. In order to do
this, we have to prove that on each hyperplane bounding
the non-negative octant the vector field points into R6+ .

For our system (1), we observe that

Therefore, the positivity of the solutions starting in the

14
interior of R6+ is assured. R6+ is positively invariant set
of the SAIUQR model system (1).
Appendix B: Proof of Theorem III.2

Proof. To prove the boundedness of the SAIUQR
system (1), we add all the model equations, which gives
N = S + A + I + U + Q + R. Taking the differentiation
gives

which is also a positively invariant set with respect to
the SAIUQR model (1). Thus, any solution trajectory
starting from an interior point of R6+ ultimately enter
into the region Ω and remains there for all finite time.
This results indicates that none of the individuals grow
unboundedly or exponentially for a finite time window.

Without any loss of generality, we can assume

Appendix C: Proof of Theorem III.3

is given by

Denote the above expression as the following:

can rewrite the SAIUQR model (1) in the following form:
dX
= F (X, V ),
dt
dV
= G(X, V ),
dt

where X = (S, R) ∈ R2 represents (its components) the
number of susceptible or uninfected individuals and V =
(A, I, U, Q) ∈ R4 represents (its components) the number of infected individuals incorporating asymptomatic,
quarantine, and infectious etc. E 0 = (X ∗ , 0) designates
the infection free steady state for the SAIUQR model
system (1). For the compartmental model (1), F (X, V )
and G(X, V ) are defined as follows:

F (X, V ) =
and

Thus,
m11 (0)
+
m22 (0)
+
m33 (0)
+
m44 (0) = m1 (0) = R0 < 1, which gives that
m1 (λ) ≤ 1. Therefore for R0 < 1, all the eigenvalues of
the characteristics equation m1 (λ) = 1 are real or have
negative real parts. Thus for R0 < 1, all the eigenvalues
are negative and hence the infection free steady state E 0
is locally asymptotically stable.
Now, if we consider R0 > 1, that is, m1 (0) > 1, then

lim m1 (λ) = 0,

λ→∞

then there exists λ∗1 > 0 in such a way that m1 (λ∗1 ) = 1.
This indicates that there exists non-negative eigenvalue
λ∗1 > 0 for the variational matrix JE 0 . Hence, the infection free steady state E 0 is unstable for R0 > 1.

Appendix D: Proof of Theorem III.4

Proof. To prove the global asymptotic stability of the
infection free steady state E 0 (S 0 , A0 , Q0 , I 0 , U 0 , R0 ), we

G(X, 0) = 0,



From the above expression of G(X, V ), it is clear that
G(X, 0) = 0.
The following two conditions (C1) and (C2) must be
met to assure the global asymptotic stability:

(C1) For dX

stable,
b

(C2) G(X, V ) = BV − G(X,

(X, V ) ∈ Ω,
where B = DI G(X ∗ , 0) is an M-matrix (the non-diagonal
components are non-negative) and in the region Ω, the
SAIUQR model system (1) is biologically feasible. The
compartmental model (1) stated in the condition (C1)
can be expressed as

Analytically solve the above system of equations, we
obtain that S(t) = Λδs + exp(−δt)(S(0) − Λδs ), and
R(t) = exp(−δt)R(0). Considering t → ∞, S(t) = Λδs
and R(t) → 0. Thus, X ∗ is globally asymptotically
stable for dX
dt = F (X, 0). Thus, the first condition (C1)
holds for the system (1).

Now the matrices B and G(X,

It is clear that B is a M-matrix as all its non-diagonal

components are non-negative. Also, G(X,
V ) ≥ 0 in the
region Ω as S(t) ≤ N (t). Also, we showed that X ∗ is a
globally asymptotically stable steady state of the system
dX

E 0 of the SAIURQ model (1) is globally asymptotically
stable in the region Ω for R0 < 1.

Appendix E: Proof of Theorem III.5

Proof. Now, we use the theory of center manifold to
investigate the local asymptotic stability of the interior
equilibrium point E ∗ (S ∗ , A∗ , Q∗ , I ∗ , U ∗ , R∗ ) by considering the disease transmission rate βs as a bifurcation
parameter, βs = βsc corresponding to R0 = 1, is

From the above expressions, it can be observed that
a < 0 and b > 0, therefore due to the Remark 1 of the
well-known Theorem 4.1 by Castillo-Chavez & Song [38],
and by Khajanchi et al. [39] a transcritical bifurcation
occurs at the basic reproduction number R0 = 1 and the
interior equilibrium point E ∗ is locally asymptotically
stable for R0 > 1.
