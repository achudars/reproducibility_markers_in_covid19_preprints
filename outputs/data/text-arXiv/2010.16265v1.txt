Abstract. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a great threat to public health and the economy worldwide. Currently, COVID-19 evolves in many countries to a second stage, characterized by
the need for the liberation of the economy and relaxation of the human psychological effects. To this
end, numerous countries decided to implement adequate deconfinement strategies. After the first prolongation of the established confinement, Morocco moves to the deconfinement stage on May 20, 2020.
The relevant question concerns the impact on the COVID-19 propagation by considering an additional
degree of realism related to stochastic noises due to the effectiveness level of the adapted measures. In
this paper, we propose a delayed stochastic mathematical model to predict the epidemiological trend
of COVID-19 in Morocco after the deconfinement. To ensure the well-posedness of the model, we prove
the existence and uniqueness of a positive solution. Based on the large number theorem for martingales,
we discuss the extinction of the disease under an appropriate threshold parameter. Moreover, numerical simulations are performed in order to test the efficiency of the deconfinement strategies chosen by
the Moroccan authorities to help the policy makers and public health administration to make suitable
decisions in the near future.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reclassified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO)
on March 11, 2020 [14], is an infectious disease caused by a new type of virus belonging to the coronaviruses
family and recently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [4]. All the countries affected by this disease have taken many preventive measures, including containment. The containment
established by the Moroccan government and the public authorities at the right time made it possible to avoid

the worst: according to the minister of Health, at least 6000 lives were saved thanks to the measures adopted
to face the spread of this pandemic [13]. The resistance measures, regarded as necessary and urgent, cannot be
sustainable.
Actually, the deconfinement is a new stage entered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, several countries
strategically planned their deconfinement strategies. The extension of the state of emergency in Morocco until
May 20, 2020 will no doubt have economic repercussions. If Morocco won the first round, or at least limited the
consequences, especially in terms of limiting the pandemic and health management of the situation, the second
seems difficult and complex. Indeed, it must not only be well thought out but also its axes of resistance have to
be well-identified. In this context, all efforts should be focused on stabilizing the economy by intelligently relying
on resources. Economic deconfinement is part of the solution and should be gradual and concerted. Indeed, it is
absurd to think that the return to the normality is in the near months, because the unavailability of an effective
vaccine implies that the virus will always be with us in the near future, which poses a risk for the population.
This economic deconfinement should be prepared and accompanied by other related measures, in particular
under health, security, education and social assistance. In this period of general crisis, the response must try to
mitigate the impacts on priority sectors, such as agriculture, agrifood, transport and foreign trade, in relation to
imports that are vital to the Moroccan economy. The challenge is to ensure resistance and a continuity of value
creation while preventing a sector from being detached from the economic body. So to speak, priority must be
given to vital sectors whose health directly affects all Moroccan activity, while protecting those bordering on
chaos. According to the deconfinement strategy, which is applied by the Moroccan authorities, it is mandatory
to study the occurrence of an eventual second wave and it’s magnitude.
Mathematical modeling through dynamical systems plays an important role to predict the evolution of
COVID-19 transmission [9,16]. However, while taking into account the deconfinement policies, the environmental effects and the social fluctuations should not be neglected in such a mathematical study in order to describe
well the dynamics and consider an additional degree of realism [2, 3, 10, 18, 21]. For these reasons, we describe
here the dynamics of the deconfinement strategy by a new D-COVID-19 model, governed by delayed stochastic
differential equations (DSDE), as follows:

where S represents the susceptible sub-population, which is not infected and has not been infected before but is
susceptible to develop the disease if exposed to the virus; C is the confined sub-population; Is is the symptomatic
infected sub-population, which has not yet been treated, it transmits the disease, and outside of proper support
it can progress to spontaneous recovery or death; Ia is the asymptomatic infected sub-population who is infected
but does not transmit the disease, is not known by the health system and progresses spontaneously to recovery;
Fb , Fg and Fc are the patients diagnosed, supported by the Moroccan health system and under quarantine, and
subdivided into three categories: benign, severe, critical forms, respectively. Finally, R and M are the recovered
and died classes, respectively. At each instant of time, the equation
D(t) := µs (1 − α)Is (t − τ3 ) + µb Fb (t − τ4 ) + µg Fg (t − τ4 ) + µc Fc (t − τ4 ) − σ3 µs Is (t − τ3 )

gives the number of the new dead due to disease. The parameter 1 − u represents the level of measures
undertaken on the susceptible population while δ is the confinement rate and ρ represents the deconfinement
rate. We adopt the bilinear incidence rate to describe the infection of the disease and use the parameter β
to denote the transmission rate. It is reasonable to assume that the infected individuals are subdivided into
individuals with symptoms and others without symptoms, for which we employ the parameter ǫ to denote the
proportion for the symptomatic individuals and 1 − ǫ for the asymptomatic ones. The parameter α measures
the efficiency of public health administration for hospitalization. Diagnosed symptomatic infected population is
completely distributed into one of the three forms Fb , Fg and Fc , by the rates γb , γg and γc , respectively. Then,
γb + γg + γc = 1. The mean recovery period of these forms are denoted by 1/rb , 1/rg and 1/rc , respectively.
The latter forms die also with the rates µb , µg and µc , respectively. Symptomatic infected population, which
is not diagnosed, moves to the recovery compartment with a rate ηs or dies with a rate µs . On the other
hand, asymptomatic infected population moves to the recovery compartment with a rate ηa . The time delays
τ1 and τ2 denote the incubation period and the period of time needed before the charge by the health system,
respectively. The time delays τ3 and τ4 denote the time required before the death of individuals coming from the
compartments Is and the three forms Fb , Fg and Fc , respectively. Here, B1 (t), B2 (t) and B3 (t) are independent
standard Brownian motions defined on a complete probability space (Ω, F , P) with a filtration {Ft }t≥0 and
satisfying the usual conditions, that is, they are increasing and right continuous while F0 contains all P-null
sets and σi represents the intensity of Bi , i = 1, 2, 3. The schematic diagram of our extended model is illustrated
in Figure 1.

Remark 1.1. The stochasticity is introduced in model (1) by perturbing the most sensitive parameters: β, α,
δ, and ρ.
Remark 1.2. For the sake of simplicity, we have assumed that the parameters δ and ρ are perturbed with the
same intensities, that is, we assume that Moroccan individuals possess the same behaviors and reactions towards
the authorities instructions.
Remark 1.3. Note that the multipliers of Is (t − τ2 ) terms are the same as σ3 dB3 (t) although they are premultiplied by different constants. Indeed, the portion of diagnosed symptomatic infected population is completely
distributed into the three forms Fb , Fg , and Fc , by the rates γb , γg and γc , respectively. Then, γb + γg + γc = 1.
In addition, we assume that the parameter α, which measures the efficiency of public health administration for
hospitalization, undergoes random fluctuations.
Remark 1.4. For illustration and clarification purposes, let us suppose, as an example, that the disease progression is started from 15th of March and value of τ1 is 5. Then a susceptible individual, after contact with an
infected one at instant t, becomes himself infected at instant t + τ1 . Suddenly, the compartment of the infected
is fed at the instant t by the susceptible infected at the instant t − τ1 . Therefore, in the considered situation,
when the infection starts at March 15, the term βǫ(1 − u)S(T )Is (T )/N of new infected is equal to zero on 12th,
13th and 14th March, due to the absence of the infection.
Remark 1.5. Temporarily asymptomatic individuals are included in the class Is of symptomatic, while individuals in Ia , who are permanently asymptomatic, will remain asymptomatic until recovery and will not spread
the virus, a fact which has been recently confirmed by the World Health Organization.
For biological reasons, we assume that the initial conditions of system (1) satisfy:
S(θ) = φ1 (θ) ≥ 0, C(θ) = φ2 (θ) ≥ 0, Ia (θ) = φ3 (θ) ≥ 0,
Is (θ) = φ4 (θ) ≥ 0, Fb (θ) = φ5 (θ) ≥ 0, Fg (θ) = φ6 (θ) ≥ 0,
Fc (θ) = φ7 (θ) ≥ 0, R(θ) = φ8 (θ) ≥ 0, M (θ) = φ9 (θ) ≥ 0,

where θ ∈ [−τ, 0] and τ = max{τ1 , τ2 τ3 , τ4 }.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 deals with the existence and uniqueness of a positive
global solution that ensures the well-posedness of the D-COVID-19 model (1). A sufficient condition for the
extinction is established in Section 3. Then, some numerical scenarios, to assess the effectiveness of the adopted
deconfinement strategy, are presented in Section 4. The paper ends up with Section 5 of conclusion.

2. Existence and uniqueness of a positive global solution
Let us denote R9+ := {(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , x6 , x7 , x8 , x9 ) | xi > 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , 9}. We begin by proving the
following result.
Theorem 1. For any initial value satisfying condition (2), there is a unique solution
x(t) = (S(t), C(t), Is (t), Ia (t), Fb (t), Fg (t), Fc (t), R(t), M (t))
to the D-COVID-19 model (1) that remains in R9+ with probability one.
Proof. Since the coefficients of the Stochastic Differential Equations with several delays (1) are locally Lipschitz
continuous, it follows from [12] that for any square integrable initial value x(0) ∈ R9+ , which is independent
of the considered standard Brownian motion B, there exists a unique local solution x(t) on t ∈ [0, τe ), where
τe is the explosion time. For showing that this solution is global, knowing that the linear growth condition is

< x(0) < k0 . For each
not verified, we need to prove that τe = ∞. Let k0 > 0 be sufficiently large for

By applying the elementary inequality 2ab ≤ a2 + b2 , we can easily increase the right-hand side of the previous

where D is an adequate selected positive constant. By integrating both sides of the equality
dV (x(t)) = LV (x(t))dt + σ(x(t))dBt

proof.

3. Extinction of the disease
In this section, we obtain a sufficient condition for the extinction of the disease.
Theorem 2. Let (S(t), C(t), Is (t), Ia (t), Fb (t), Fg (t), Fc (t), R(t), M (t)) be a solution of the D-COVID-19 model

COVID-19 is known as a highly contagious disease and its transmission rate, β, varies from country to
country, according to the density of the country and movements of its population. Ozair et al. [17] assumed
β to be [0.198 − 0.594] per day for Romania, and [0.097 − 0.291] per day for Pakistan. Further, Kuniya [10]
estimated β as 0.26 (95%CI, 2.4 − 2.8). Observing the number of daily reported cases of COVID-19 in Morocco,
we estimate β as 0.4517 (95%CI, 0.4484 − 0.455). After the infection, the patient remains in a latent period
for 5.5 days [1,20], in average, before becoming symptomatic and infectious or asymptomatic with a percentage
that varies from 20.6% of infected population to 39.9% [15], while the time needed before his hospitalization
is estimated to be 7.5 days [6, 8, 19]. All the parameter values chosen for the D-COVID-19 model (1) are
summarized in Table 2.

Remark 4.1. From a biological point of view, the latency period is independent of the region or country under
study, depending only on the structural nature of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
We consider that all measures and the adopted confinement strategy previously discussed are conserved. The
evolution on the number of diagnosed infected positive individuals given by the D-COVID-19 model (1) versus
the daily reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Morocco, from March 2 to May 6, is presented in Figure 2.
We see that the curve generated by the D-COVID-19 model (1) follows the trend of the daily reported cases in
Morocco. So, we confirm that the implemented measures taken by the authorities have an explicit impact on
the propagation of the virus in the population since the curve of the D-COVID-19 model (1) has been flattening
from April 17 and tends to go towards the extinction of the disease from May 05. In Figure 3, we see that
Morocco has spent almost 40% of the total duration of the epidemic at May 11 and will reach extinction after
four months, in average, from the start of the epidemic on March 2, 2020 (t = 0).

To prove the biological importance of delay parameters, we give the graphical results of Figure 4, which
allow to compare the evolution of diagnosed positive cases with and without delays. We observe in Figure 4 a
high impact of delays on the number of diagnosed positive cases. Indeed, the plot of model (1) without delays
(τi = 0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4) is very far from the clinical data. Thus, we conclude that delays play an important role
in the study of the dynamical behavior of COVID-19 worldwide, especially in Morocco, and allows to better
understand the reality.
In Figures 5, 6, and 7, we consider the deconfinement of 30% of the population returning to work from May
20, and this proportion is immediately integrated into the susceptible population. Numerical simulations are
presented for three possible scenarios. In the first, we consider that the whole population highly respects the
majority of the measures announced by the authorities in relation with the deconfinement (Figure 5). The
second and third scenarios show the direct impact on the curves when the population moderately respects the

measures with different levels, σ2 = 0.10 and σ2 = 0.15, respectively. With the last two scenarios we observe
the growth in the final number of infected, deaths, severe and critical forms, which are the most important to
monitor, since the health system should not be saturated. It is also important to note the appearance of a
second significant peak and the fact that the time required for extinction becomes longer, which relates to the
value of σ2 (Figures 6 and 7).

5. Conclusion
In this work, we have proposed a delayed stochastic mathematical model to describe the dynamical spreading
of COVID-19 in Morocco by considering all measures designed by authorities, such as confinement and deconfinement policies. More precisely, our model takes into account four types of delays: the first one is related to
the incubation period, the second is the time needed to move from the symptomatic infected individuals to the
three forms of diagnosed cases, the third is the time needed to move from the class of infected individuals to the

recovered or dead class, while the last one is the time needed to pass from the three types of classes of individuals supported by the Moroccan health system, and under quarantine, to the recovered or dead compartments.
Besides, to well describe reality, we have added a stochastic factor resulting from possible maladjustment of the
population individuals to the measures.
To show that our model is mathematically and biologically well-posed, we have proved the global existence
of a unique positive solution (see Theorem 1). Our result has shown a possible extinction of the disease when
σ12 is greater than a threshold parameter (see Theorem 2).
In addition, numerical simulations have been performed to forecast the evolution of COVID-19. More precisely, we have shown that the evolution of our D-COVID-19 model follows the tendency of daily reported
confirmed cases in Morocco (see Figure 2). Further, if Moroccan people would maintain, strictly, their confinement policy, we observe that the disease dies out around four months from March 2, 2020 (see Figure 3). On the
other hand, in response to the decision of deconfinement represented by the liberation of the 30% of population,
which took place at May 20, we simulate three scenarios corresponding to different values of the intensity σ2 .
When σ2 = 0.01 (Figure 5), the eradication of the disease from the population comes early compared to the
cases when σ2 = 0.10 (Figure 6) and σ2 = 0.15 (Figure 7). Additionally, the number of diagnosed confirmed
cases mainly changes because of the value of this intensity and a small perturbation leads to relevant quantitative changes and significant variations on the time needed for extinction. Thus, we observe that the value of
this perturbation has a high impact on the evolution of COVID-19, which means the Moroccan population has
a big interest to respect the governmental measures announced May 20, 2020, in order to have a successful and
good deconfinement strategy.
Here we have compared the predictions of the proposed model (1) with real data until middle of May 2020.
We leave the comparison of the real data in Morocco till the end of 2020 to a future work, where we also plan
to incorporate the predictions of the evolution of our COVID-19 model with respect to preventive Moroccan
measures by regions and cities.
