Abstract
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or
Covid-19, burst into a pandemic in the beginning of 2020. An unprecedented
worldwide effort involving academic institutions, regulatory agencies and industry is facing the challenges imposed by the rapidly spreading disease. Emergency
use authorization for vaccines were granted in the beginning of December 2020
in Europe and nine days later in the United States. The urge for vaccination
started a race, forcing governs and health care agencies to take decisions on
the fly regarding the vaccination strategy and logistics. So far, the vaccination
strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing and
the use of face masks, are the only efficient actions to stop the pandemic. In this
context, it is of fundamental importance to understand the dynamical behavior
of the Covid-19 spread along with possible vaccination strategies. In this work a
Susceptible - Infected - Removed - Sick with vaccination (SIRSi-Vaccine) model
is proposed. In addtion, the SIRSi-Vaccine model also accounts for unreported,
or asymptomatic, cases and the possibility of temporary immunity, either after
infection or vaccination. Disease free and endemic equilibrium points existence
conditions are determined in the (ω × θ) vaccine-effort and social distancing
parameter space. The model is adjusted to the data from São Paulo, Santos

1. Introduction
In 30 January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Four weeks before,
the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission had reported a cluster of pneumonia
cases, whose causative agent was soon after discovered to be the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or Covid-19. Despite the
WHO alert, the Covid-19 became pandemic weeks later, in March 2020 [1, 2].
It is of great concern the fact that worldwide governs and Health Care Agencies were unable to stop the Covid-19 pandemic in its beginning. As a result,
the rapidly spreading disease is challenging health care angencies, academic
institutions and industry to develop and deploy efficient drug treatments and
vaccination.
A number of drugs have been tried in patients with Covid-19 disease. Unfortunately, studies [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] found that the drugs had little or no effect on
the overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, duration of hospital stay or viral
clearance even for patients with chronic use of some of the tried drugs.
On the other hand, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as physical
distancing, use of face masks and eye protection, reduce the virus transmission
[8, 9]. Worldwide populations have been compliant to NPI, however, in some
countries, there is a controversy over its effectiveness [10]. In Brazil, the closure
of non-essential activities lasted only for a short time, and the cities lifted NPI
in an uncoordinated manner [9]. As a result, in the beginning of November
2020, the downward trend reversed and the number of Covid-19 cases started
to raise in a second wave of infection [11].
The development of vaccines usually takes many years, even decades, and is
also very expensive. The fast development of Covid-19 vaccines was only possible

2

since researchers had been working for years on vaccines for similar viruses,
such as, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome). In addition, the experience gained with the Ebola
vaccine showed that the development of new vaccines can be accelerated with
a worldwide effort, including academic institutions, industry and health care
regulatory agencies, without compromising safety [12, 13, 14].
There are currently 78 vaccines in clinical trial on humans, and other 77
are under investigation in animals. Emergency use authorization for vaccines
were granted in the beginning of December 2020 by Britain’s National Health
Service, and later on by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In
january 2021 the Brazilian national health surveillance agency (Anvisa) also
granted emergency use for vaccines. Up to now, in several countries, 6 vaccines
have been granted emergency use, and 7 approved for full use [15, 16].
The Covid-19 pandemic, and the consequent urge for vaccination, started
a race, with countries trying to vaccinate populations as fast as possible. In
[17] the immunization results of a nationwide mass vaccination in Israel is reported, strengthening the expectation of Covid-19 pandemic effects mitigation.
However, at the current pace, and for most countries, a successful vaccination
strategy consists of a long journey ahead [18].
Logistics plays an important role in vaccination strategies deployment, since
the efficacy1 of the vaccines currently in development ranges from 50.38% to
95.0% [15], and that different vaccines need different vaccination strategies,
given the number of doses, the number of weeks apart each dose, specific storage
facility needs, and so on.
Besides, Health Care Agencies must take decisions considering the Covid19 new variants, vaccination strategy with varying NPI adherence among the
population, or consider to delay the second dose in order to speed up the one
dose vaccinated population [19, 20]. In addition, important factors are vaccine

a clinical trial.

efficacy and population vaccination cover. Vaccines have to have at least 70%
efficacy with population cover of 75% to prevent a pandemic without any other
intervention. To stop the ongoing pandemic the needed vaccines efficacy raises
to at least 80%, for 75% population cover [21].
Given such complex context it is important to understand the dynamical
behavior of the Covid-19 pandemic, considering possible vaccination strategies
in order to mitigate of even to extinguish the ongoing pandemic.
Many scientific works have been developed since the beginning of the pandemic, aiming to stop, or mitigate, the pandemic effects, consisting of control
systems strategies, and deep learning modeling. Other works, consisting of
mathematical modeling, analysis, and numerical simulations, in order to predict the Covid-19 contagious behavior, have also been published.
In [22] time-series models - Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)
are developed for the COVID-19 pandemic, with data for the countries where
70% - 80% of global cumulative cases are located. The results show exponential
growth of confirmed cases and deaths. In [23] a two parameter model is used to
predict the pandemic evolution in France.
A Susceptible - Infected - Removed model is used to predict the Covid-19
pandemic in Kuwait [24]. A SIR-type model with non-constant population is
developed In [25]. The model is calibrated to the rates of infection and deaths
for Italy, Spain and the USA.
In [26] the death toll due to the Covid-19 pandemic is modeled via sigmoid
curve, predicting mortality, and estimating practical interest values such as the
number of new cases per infection, i.e., the basic reproduction number.
In [27] a mathematical model of Covid-19 is developed. A control system
is proposed aiming to reduce the number of the susceptible individuals in a
population applying NPI consisting of social distancing.
A number of works consider deep learning to predict the number of Covid19 cases. In [28] a prediction model of confirmed and death cases of Covid19 is developed, based on a deep learning algorithm with two long short-term
4

memory layers, considering the available data for Covid-19 in India. In [29],
multilayer deep learning models with perceptron, random forest and Long shortterm memory, are trained and used to forecast the Covid-19 pandemic in Iran.
In [30] a Susceptible - Infected - Removed - Sick (SIRSi) model is proposed,
modeling unreported or asymptomatic cases, and considering the effects of temporary acquired immunity on the Covid-19 spread.
In this work, the model proposed in [30] is modified, and a vaccination
strategy is included, consisting of a vaccination rate of susceptible individuals.
The proposed SIRSi-Vaccine model is composed of four compartments, namely,
Susceptible, Infected, Sick and Recovered. The focus is to assess the effects of
vaccination associated with social distancing as a NPI in the Covid-19 spread
dynamics.
The proposed SIRSi-Vaccine model presents both disease free and endemic
equilibrium points. The equilibrium points stabilities are studied both analytically and numerically, and, as a result, the found equilibrium existence condition
relates the effects of the social distancing to the vaccination rate.
In addition, the SIRSi-Vaccine model is numerically adjusted to the epidemic
situation in São Paulo, Santos and Campinas, three major cities in the State
of São Paulo connecting the shores with the interior of the São Paulo state.
The numerical results show that in order to stop the Covid-19 spread different
strategies may be necessary for different cities, concerning social distancing NPI
and vaccination rates.
The paper is organized as follows; Section 2 presents the mathematical
model. In Section 3 the equilibrium points are determined and their stability are investigated. The parametric fitting is presented in Section 4. In Section
5 the simulations results for São Paulo, Santos and Campinas are presented.
The final remarks are shown in Section 6.

2. SIRSi and SIRSi-Vaccine mathematical models
A constant population model with four compartments is proposed, see Fig.
1. The compartments are defined as: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), Infected
symptomatic positive tested (Sick ) and Recovered (R).
In Fig 1, I is the infectious population compartment representing the population in the incubation stage, i.e., prior to the onset of symptoms. Transmission
during this period has been reported in [31, 32, 33].

Figure 1: SIRSi model with constant population.

The infected population can be asymptomatic or symptomatic, and according to [34] the incubation period is assumed to be of 5.1 days. Infectiousness
occur 12 hours prior to the symptoms onset for the symptomatic. On the other
hand, for those who are asymptomatic, the infectiousness is assumed to occur
4.6 days after infection. The average time between infection and infectiousness
is 6.5 days.
Those who are asymptomatic or do not develop severe symptoms, i.e., neither
tested nor documented cases, are moved to the R (Recovered) compartment after
a 1/β1 period [30].
The incubation period for those who are sympotmatic is 1/β2 . Once the
infected individual is tested positive and the case is documented, it is moved to
the Sick compartment, which consists of those patients with severe symptoms
seeking medical attention.

6

After a period 1/β3 the Sick population that recovers is moved to the compartment R.
The possibility of temporary immunity for recovered individuals, as addressed in [35, 36, 37, 30], is also considered. As it can be seen in Fig. 1,
the recovered R population becomes susceptible S again at a rate γ.
The model is developed considering the population size constraint of Eq. 1.
In addition, the population growth and death rates µ, including deaths due to
Covid-19, are similar in the State of São Paulo [38], therefore, in this work, they
are considered to be equal.

N = S(t) + I(t) + Sick (t) + R(t)

From the foregoing considerations the SIRSi mathematical model is given
by Eq. 2.

In Eq. 2, the effect of social distancing measure, which is a form of NPI,
is introduced by the parameter θ, 0 < θ < 1. Where θ = 0 means that no
social distancing measure is under consideration, and θ = 1 means a complete
lockdown.
A normalization with respect to the population size N is performed in Eq.
1, resulting in Eq. 3,

1 = s(t) + i(t) + sick (t) + r(t)

(3)

where s(t) = S(t)/N , i(t) = I(t)/N , sick (t) = Sick (t)/N and r(t) = R(t)/N .
Replacing Eq. 3 into the system of Eq. 2, results Eq. 4.

(4)

In addition, from Eq. 3, the recovered compartment r(t) can be written as
a linear combination of the other compartments (or state variables), as shown
in Eq. 5,

r(t) = 1 − s(t) − i(t) − sick (t),

(5)

consequently, the solutions Ω = {(s(t), i(t), sick (t)) ∈ R3+ | s(t) + i(t) + sick (t) ≤
1} of the system of Eq. 4 can be studied in the system of Eq. 6,

A vaccination intervention is introduced consisting of susceptible individuals
vaccinated at a rate ω. The vaccinated individuals are considered to become
instantaneously immune after vaccination, being moved to the recovered compartment. The proposed SIRSi-Vaccine model is shown in Fig. 2.
Including the vaccination intervention in Eqs. 4 and 6 results in Eqs. 8 and
9, respectively.

3. Disease-free and endemic equilibrium points
In this section the equilibrium points for the mathematical models in Eqs.
6 and 9 are determined and their stabilities are analysed.
3.1. SIRSi equilibrium points
The system of Eq. 6 has two equilibrium points, one is consistent with a
disease-free situation, and the other representing an endemic equilibrium.

The disease-free equilibrium point Pdf 1 is given by Eq. 10.

(12)

In order to analyze the local stability of the point, the Jacobian matrix J of
the system in Eq. 6 is shown in Eq. 13.

The eigenvalues associated with Pdf 1 , the disease free equilibrium point, are
given by Eq. 14.

λ1 = −(µ + γ)
λ2 = α(1 − θ) − (β1 + β2 + µ)

(14)

λ3 = −(β3 + µ)
The eigenvalue λ2 shows the possibility of a bifurcation since it can change
sign depending on the parameters values. Therefore, the disease free equilibrium
point Pdf 1 is stable if

α(1 − θ) < β1 + β2 + µ.
10

(15)

Comparing Eqs. 7 and Eq. 15 it can be noticed that if R0 < 1 then Pdf 1
is locally asymptotically stable. On the other hand, if R0 > 1, then Pdf 1 is
unstable.
Considering the endemic equilibrium point Pe1 , Eqs. 11 and 12, and the
Jacobian matrix, Eq. 13, the characteristic polynomial of Pe1 is given by Eq.
16, where the coefficients are given by Eq. 17.
Pe1 (λ) = λ3 + a1 λ2 + a2 λ + a3 ,

(16)

a1 = ϕα(1 − θ) (β3 + µ) + β3 + γ + 2µ
a2 = (β3 + µ) [γ + µ + ϕα(1 − θ) (β1 + β2 + β3 + γ + 2µ)]


β1 β3 + β1 µ + β2 β3 + β2 γ

a3 = ϕα (1 − θ) (β3 + µ) 
+β2 µ + β3 γ + β3 µ + γµ + µ2

(17)

The coefficients a1 , a2 and a3 , in Eq. 17, are positive real numbers if ϕ > 0
(see Eq. 12). In this case, in order to determine whether the characteristic
polynomial in Eq. 16 has unstable or stable roots the Routh-Hurwitz stability
criterion [39] is used.
Consequently, the characteristic polynomial in Eq. 16 is stable if expression
18 holds.

b 1 = a2 −

a3

a1

(18)

The proof that expression 18 holds true demands some mathematical reasoning, which results in Eq. 19.

b1 =

c2 = (β1 + β2 )(β3 + µ) + β32 + β3 γ + 3β3 µ + γµ + 2µ2 ,
c3 = β1 γ + β1 µ + β2 µ + β32 + 2β3 γ + 4β3 µ + γ 2 + 4γµ + 4µ2 ,
c4 = β3 γ + β3 µ + γ 2 + 3γµ + 2µ2 .
The expression inside brackets in Eq. 19 is positive if ϕ > 0. Consequently,
for ϕ > 0 the expression 18 holds true, and P3 is asymptotically stable. In
addition, as it can be seen in Eq. 12, ϕ > 0 implies that R0 > 1.
3.2. SIRSi-Vaccine equilibrium points
Similarly to what was found in Section 3.2, the SIRSi-Vaccine mathematical
model of Eq. 9 has two equilibrium points, the first one is consistent with a
disease-free situation, and the other with an endemic equilibrium.
The disease free equilibrium point of Eq. 9 is shown in Eq. 20, for s∗ > 0.

The local stability of the equilibrium points are determined with the Jacobian
matrix shown in Eq. 3.2.

The disease free equilibrium point Pdf 2 is associated with the eigenvalues λ1 ,
λ2 and λ3 in Eqs. 24, 25 and 26, respectively.

(24)

λ1 = −(γ + µ + ω)
λ2 = −(β1 + β2 + µ) + α(1 − θ)

µ+γ
µ+γ+ω

(25)
(26)

λ3 = −(β3 + µ)

From Eq. 24 and 26 it can be seen that λ1 and λ3 are negative. However,
λ3 is negative only if the condition in 27 holds true.

ω>




α(1 − θ)
− 1 (µ + γ) = (R0 − 1) (µ + γ)
β1 + β2 + µ

(27)

Therefore, considering the foregoing relations, and if condition 27 holds, the
point Pe2 is locally asymptotically stable.
Now, regarding the endemic equilibrium point Pe2 , it exists only if the condition expressed in 28 holds true.

ω≤




α(1 − θ)
− 1 (µ + γ) = (R0 − 1) (µ + γ)
β1 + β2 + µ

(28)

It is interesting to notice that the existence condition depends on the vaccination rate ω. Besides, for R0 < 1, Pe2 exists only for negative values of ω,
which is a case of no physical concern.
The stability of the endemic equilibrium point Pe2 is conditioned to parameters combinations, including the social distancing (θ) and the vaccination rate
(ω) parameters. The mathematical reasoning to derive and prove such stability
conditions is cumbersome, for that reason, numerical analysis is used to infer
the stability of the point.
13

The simulations results presented in Section 5, show that if the disease free
equilibrium point Pdf 2 is unstable, then the trajectories in the vicinity of Pe2
are stable. These results can be seen from the numerical analysis represented
by the bifurcation graphs in Section 5.

4. SIRSi-Vaccine model parametric fitting
In this section, the parameters of the SIRSi model (Eq. 6) are numerically
determined by parametric fitting using public available data covering a one year
period of the Covid-19 pandemic, specifically, ranging from March, 2020 to
March, 2021.
The SIRSi-Vaccine model considers the social distancing influence on the
Covid-19 infectiousness. Recently, a number of works have reported that Covid19 epidemiological models are strongly sensitive to social distancing index [40,
41, 34, 30].
The social distancing index is time-varying, presenting an oscillatory behavior with approximately 7-days period, a feature that impairs the numerical
parametric adjustment of the SIRSi-Vaccine model.
In order to avoid numerical problems, the approach is to use a polynomial
function adjusted to the social distancing data as the social distancing index.
The data is obtained using privacy-protected mobile phone device location information available in SEADE [42] for São Paulo, Campinas and Santos.
For the least-squares parameters adjustment raw data was used for São
Paulo. On the other hand, for Campinas and Santos, instead of the raw data, a
21-day moving average filter was used in order to smooth the data prior to the
least-squares fitting. In spite of that, the filtered data preserves both monthly
trend and general behavior. The social distancing index polynomial fitting results can be seen in Figs. 3, 4 and 5.
For all the other parameters, the Least-squares Trust Region Reflective
(TRR) algorithm [43, 44], which is a robust real-time optimization method,
was used to fit the number of Covid-19 confirmed cases.

The free parameters in the fitting process are (γ, α, β1 , β2 , β3 ) (see Fig.

the pandemic. The other normalized initial conditions are sick (0) = 0 and
i(0) = 1 − s(0). In addition, for the lower and upper bounds of the parameters,
epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Covid-19 reported in the literature
where considered [45, 46, 47, 48]
The confirmed cases are considered to be the sick (t) compartment population
in the model of Eq. 9. The results of the least-squares TRR fitting comparing

5. Simulation results
In this section, the numerical simulations of the SIRSi-Vaccine model (Eq.
9) are performed. The parameters used for the SIRSi-Vaccine model simulations
are the same parameters determined for the SIRSi model in Section 4, and shown

In the simulations the social distancing index θ and the vaccination rate ω
are kept constant over time. However, they are set up with different values in
each performed simulation.
Two different scenarios are considered. Firstly, the vaccination rate is set
to ω = 0, and the numerical simulations are performed for different values
of the social distancing index, ranging from θ = 0.0, i.e., no social distancing
intervention, to θ = 0.7 which means that 70% of the population is locked home,
keeping social distancing.
In the next scenario, the social distancing index θ is set up equal to the

5.1. Simulation results for Santos
The simulations in Fig. 9 show that without vaccination the Covid-19 spread
do not decay for a social distancing index less than θ = 0.5. On the other hand,
for θ = 0 the number of cases nearly triple, which is a potential threath to
health care units. With θ = 0.7 the infected population rapidly decay until the
mid July, a behavior that is observed also for θ = 0.5, but slower in this last
case.
It is important to point out that this hypothetical behavior offers an insight

to what could be the result in such situation, since the social distancing data
shows that θ, in fact, presents a moving average value behavior combined with
a 7-days periodic oscillation.
The simulations in Fig. 10 are performed adopting constant social distancing

with the equilibrium points stability and existing conditions in Section 3.2.
For the vaccination rate ω < 0.1 in Fig. 10, the disease free equilibrium

Fig. 11 is also a bifurcation diagram, showing the stable region (dark-blue) in
the parameter space of the disease free equilibrium point. The light-blue and
green areas indicate the region where the disease free point is unstable. The
same region indicates the existence of the endemic equilibrium.
In addition, Fig. 11 shows the relation between the social distancing index
θ and the vaccination rate ω, indicating how to develop a vaccination strategy,
combined with NPI for the city of Santos.
In this case, with an isolation index θ > 0.5 and a small vaccination rate,
the number of confirmed cases decay to a disease free equilibrium. On the
other hand, for θ < 0.3, the vaccination rate must be much higher, for instance
ω > 0.4, otherwise the number of cases do not decay, remaining constant over
time, in a situation compatible with an stable endemic equilibrium.
5.2. Simulation results for Campinas
The qualitative general behavior of the simulations for Campinas, shown in
Figs. 12, 13 and 14, is similar to what is presented in the Section 5.1.
In Fig. 12 the number of confirmed cases is shown considering ω = 0, and
for different values of social distancing index θ.

As a result, it can be seen that for social distancing index higher than 0.5,
i.e, θ > 0.5, the disease free equilibrium is stable - condition 27 holds true - and
the number of cases decay to zero over time.
Differently, for θ < 0.5, the disease free equilibrium is unstable. The endemic
equilibrium exists - condition 28 holds true - and the number of cases do not
decay over time. It is important to notice that for θ < 0.3 the number of
confirmed cases abruptly increases, nearly quadrupling in a very short period.
This indicates the importance of NPI to mitigate the Covid-19 spread and to

The simulations of infected confirmed cases for Campinas, considering a
constant social distancing index θ, see Table 2, and different values for the
vaccination rate ω, are shown in Fig. 13. In this case, a vaccination rate ω = 0.1
is enough to generate a stable disease free response. For smaller vaccination
rates, however, the endemic equilibrium exists and the simulations suggests it
is stable.

ing stable disease free responses is considerably smaller for Campinas than for
Santos. This behavior is probably due to the re-susceptibility feedback gain γ,
since the value found for Santos is nearly 2.6 times bigger than for Campinas,
see Tables 1 and 2.
Another relevant information is the slightly bigger social distancing data dispersion for Santos, that influences on the infectiousness of the Covid-19 spread,
and probably on the re-susceptibility feedback gain γ.

Again, for São Paulo, the qualitative general behavior of the simulations
shown in Figs. 15, 16 and 17, is similar to the behavior of the simulations
presented in the Sections 5.1 and 5.2.
In Fig. 15 the simulations of the infection confirmed cases for ω = 0 and for
different values of the social distancing index θ are shown. It can be seen that
for θ > 0.5 the disease free equilibrium point is stable, i. e., condition 27 holds
true, consequently the number of cases decay to zero over time.

On the other hand, for simulations with θ < 0.5 the disease free equilibrium
is unstable, and since the condition 28 holds true, the endemic equilibrium
exists. Therefore, the number of cases do not decay over time.
For θ < 0.3 the number of infection confirmed cases increases very fast,
threatening the health care units of collapsing in a short period of time.
The simulations of infection confirmed cases shown in Fig. 16, indicate that
for ω ≥ 0.1 the disease free equilibrium is stable. On the contrary, for the
simulated values of ω < 0.1, the endemic equilibrium is stable while the disease

Comparing Figs. 17, 14 and 11, it is clear that the simulation results obtained
for São Paulo and Campinas are very similar concerning the behavior related
to the social distancing index θ and the vaccination rate ω. In order to stop the
Covid-19 spread in Santos, the vaccination rate need to be higher.
The least-square fitting was performed differently for Campinas and Santos
due to the dispersion of the social distancing index. The influence of this procedure is still not clear, and further investigation may be needed in order improve

6. Conclusions
A compartmental model of the Covid-19 pandemic is proposed consisting of
four compartments, namely: Susceptible - Infected - Recovered - Sick with vaccination (SIRSi-Vaccine), considering a vaccination strategy and the possibility
of recovered patients become susceptible again, that is, individuals loose their
acquired immunity either after recovery or vaccination.

The proposed SIRSi-Vaccine model has both disease free and endemic equilibrium points, presenting interchangeable stability, that is, the condition that
assures stability for the disease free equilibrium imply the nonexistence of the
endemic equilibrium. On the other hand, the endemic equilibrium existence
condition imply on the instability of the disease free equilibrium. In addition,
the existence and stability conditions of expressions 27 and 28 depend on both
the reproduction basic number R0 and on the vaccination rate ω.

demic publicly available data for Santos, Campinas and São Paulo. The qualitative general behavior of the simulations is compatible with the analytical results.
However, comparing the simulations of Santos with Campinas and São Paulo,
a slightly different behavior is found for Santos.
The difference is probably due to the re-susceptibility feedback gain γ, determined by the least-squares algorithm, that is 2.6 times higher for Santos, when
compared with Campinas and São Paulo. This result indicates that for Santos,
a successful vaccination strategy imply a higher vaccination rate.
Another result is the influence of the social distancing index θ. Small vari31

ations on this index can generate abrupt increase in the number of infected
confirmed Covid-19 cases in a short period of time. This behavior is of special
concern due to the possible threat to health care units.
