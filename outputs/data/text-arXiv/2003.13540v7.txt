Abstract
A new coronavirus disease, called COVID-19, appeared in the Chinese region of Wuhan at the end of last year; since then the virus spread
to other countries, including most of Europe. We propose a differential
equation governing the evolution of the COVID-19. This dynamic equation also describes the evolution of the number of infected people for 13
common respiratory viruses (including the SARS-CoV-2). We validate
our theoretical predictions with experimental data for Italy, Belgium and
Luxembourg, and compare them with the predictions of the logistic model.
We find that our predictions are in good agreement with the real world
since the beginning of the appearance of the COVID-19; this is not the
case for the logistic model that only applies to the first days. The second
part of the work is devoted to modelling the descending phase, i.e. the
decrease of the number of people tested positive for COVID-19. Also in
this case, we propose a new set of dynamic differential equations that we
solved numerically. We use our differential equations parametrised with
experimental data to make several predictions, such as the date when
Italy, Belgium, and Luxembourg will reach a peak number of SARS-CoV2 infected people. The descending curves provide valuable information
such as the duration of the COVID-19 epidemic in a given Country and
therefore when it will be possible to return to normal life. The study of
the the dynamics of COVID-19 when the population have been subject

Introduction

Viral infections usually affect the upper or lower respiratory tract. Although
respiratory infections can be classified according to the causative agent (e.g.
the flu), they are mostly clinically classified according to the type of syndrome
(e.g., common cold, bronchiolitis, laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis acute, pneumonia).
Although pathogens typically cause characteristic clinical manifestations (e.g.,
rhinovirus causes the common cold, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] usually
causes bronchiolitis), they can all cause many of the most common respiratory
syndromes. The severity of viral respiratory disease is highly variable; serious
illness is more frequent in elderly patients and young children. Morbidity can
either directly result from the infecting agent, or may be indirect. The latter
case can be due to the exacerbation of an underlying cardiopulmonary disease,
or a bacterial superinfection of the lung, paranasal sinuses, or middle ear. The
main motivation of this work is to verify, by making theoretical predictions, that
political decisions are truly effective to minimise the number of infected people
in order to (i) not overload local health services (such as hospitals), and to (ii)
gain time to allow research institutes to deliver vaccines or the anti-virals.
Tables (1) and (3) respectively provide the experimental data for Italy [1] and for
Belgium [2], [3]. They show the number of active people (i.e., people currently
infected by SARS-CoV-2), the recovered people, and deaths for COVID-19.
We start our theoretical analysis by introducing the definition of the basic reproduction number of an infection R0 , defined as the number of infected people
derived from a first case in a population where all the others are susceptible. So,
it is not possible to modify R0 , in any case, but it is possible to get a different
effective R1 . This parameter is strictly linked to the replication time of a virus,
indicated with µi , defined as the time interval after which the number of infected
people has increased by R0 times. Fig. 1 schematically represents the diffusion
dynamics of the virus. By indicating with N the number of infected people,
after n steps we get2 :
N = R0n

Of course, after n steps, the elapsed time is t = i=1 µi and, if there are M
1 More rigourously, in epidemiology, the basic reproduction number of an infection, R ,

is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all
individuals are susceptible to infection in absence of any deliberate intervention in disease
transmission (see, for example, [4]).

books or thesis dissertation such as, for example, [5] or [6].

However, for SARS-CoV-2, the value of R0 is 2 even at the beginning of the
outbreak in China and Italy. After a period of time µ1 , an infected individual
can infect R0 other individuals. In turn, after a period µ2 , each of these newly
infected individualsP
can infect other R0 people, and so on. After n steps the

elapsed time is t = i=1 µi .

with µ ≡ 1/n i=1 µi . Note that the two parameters R0 and µ are not independent (see, for example, [7], [8] or [9])4 . It is more convenient to work in the
Euler base e rather than in base R0 ; in the Euler base Eq. (2) provides the law
of growth of a Malthusian population [5].

N = M exp(t/τ ) where τ =

log(R0 )
In literature, τ is referred to as the characteristic time of the exponential trend.
So, in the absence of containment measures the number of infected people follows
the exponential law (3). Let us now analyse Eq. (3) in more dept. We have
three possible scenarios:
1. R0 > 1 (as is the current world’s situation). For Italy, for example, before
the adoption of (severe) containment measures, the value of τ was about
τ ∼ 3.8 days (and µ ∼ 2.6 days). In this case the number of the infected
people increases exponentially.
2. R0 = 1 If the infection-capacity of the virus is of the type one-to-one
(i.e., a person infected by SARS-CoV-2 can in turn infects only another
person), we get the stationary situation corresponding to N = 1. This
situation is referred to as the latent situation i.e., the virus is still present
but does not spread. In this limit case, the SARS-CoV-2 is substantially
ineffective. Scenarios (1) and (2) are illustrated in Fig. 2.
3. 0 < R0 < 1. We may also imagine that the capacity of infection of
SARS-CoV-2 is less than 1. This means that the virus is no longer able
to be spread (e.g., thanks to protective measures, or to the production
of vaccines and anti-virals, or because people who overcame the disease
became immune. In this case, the value of τ is negative and the number
of infected people decreases ever time. That is, the infection eventually
disappears. The rate of decrease of the number of infected people depends
on the value of τ . This scenario is depicted in Fig. 3.

Comparison with the Real Data for COVID-19 before
the Lockdown Measures

It is understood that the main objective of the lockdown measures established by
most European governments and health organisations is to reduce the ability

to mention another excellent work recently produced by G. Steinbrecher [9].

of a virus to spread. From a mathematical point of view, we would like to
have R0 = 1 (or, better, R0 < 1), in Eq. (3) instead of R0 > 1. In practical
terms, this means reducing the frequency of all involuntary contacts with a large
number of people, reducing unnecessary movements to avoid encounters, and to
prolong the closure of schools. Although these measures cannot prevent the
spread of the infection in the long term, they can reduce the number of new
infections daily. This has the benefit of leaving room for seriously-ill patients by
avoiding to overload the healthcare system. We can easily realise what are the
consequences if the lockdown measures are not set up. To make a comparison
between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data in absence of
lockdown measures, we have to consider the correct reference period. More
specifically, we saw that the number of positive cases grows in the course of
time by following the law (3). Hence, at the reference time t0 , the number of
people infected by the virus is
N0 = M exp(t0 /τ )

(4)

After a period of time, say t, Eq. (3) reads
N = M exp(t/τ )

(5)

N = N0 exp((t − t0 )/τ )

(6)

Hence,

Eq. (6) is the equation that we use for comparing the mathematical predictions
with experimental data during the initial phase where the spread of SARSCoV-2, causing the COVID-19, follows the exponential law, and (t − t0 ) is our
reference period. For the case of COVID-19 we get (see, for example, [5] or [6])
• All infectious outbreaks are exactly at the same conditions. So, Eq. (2)
applies;
• R0 = 2;
• All the µi are equal with each other: µi = const = µ (see also [5] and [7]).
In this case, µ is referred to as the doubling time. So, the doubling time is
the amount of time it takes for a given quantity to double in size or value at a
constant growth rate [8]. If we do not apply the locking measures, the evolution
in the course of time of the number of infected people is best approximated by
an exponential curve with R = 2, even though we have to stress that R0 is
only associated with the beginning of the epidemic and, with certain approximations, with the early stages, but not beyond. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 respectively
show the comparison between the theoretical predictions and the experimental
data for Italy and Belgium before the lockdown measures. We get τ ' 3.8
days and µ ' 2.6 days for Italy, and τ ' 5.2 days and µ ' 3.7 days for
Belgium. We conclude this Introduction by mentioning that there are several
methods currently proposed in Literature to derive by mathematical models,
the value of R0 . For example, in ref. [9], we have a short numerical code, written in R-programming language for statistical computing and graphics, able
to compute the estimated R0 values for the following 17 infectious diseases:
Chickenpox (varicella) (Transmission: Aerosol), Common cold (Transmission:
Respiratory Droplets), COVID-19 (Transmission: Respiratory Droplets), Diphtheria (Transmission: Saliva), Ebola - 2014 Ebola outbreak (Transmission::

Pertussis (Transmission: Respiratory Droplets), Polio (Transmission: Fecal
oral route), Rubella (Transmission: Respiratory Droplets), SARS (Transmission: Respiratory Droplets), Smallpox (Transmission: Respiratory Droplets).
However, this task is particularly problematic if there are intermediate vectors
between hosts, such as malaria.
This manuscript is organised as follows. Section (2) determines the dynamic
differential equation for the COVID-19; Section (2.3) compares the theoretical
predictions and experimental data for Italy and Belgium. The differential equations providing the evolution of the decrease of the number of people tested
positive for COVID-19 can be found in Section (3); Section (4) concludes. The

that we are dealing data from countries which have passed the peak of infection,
such as South Korea, Iceland or Austria etc. The situation in other Countries,
which may have adopted other political decisions about the application of the
lockdown measures, may be subject of future works. However, we would like to
mention that several authors are currently applying our model to other Countries. In this regard, we have received their pre-prints such as the work cited in
Ref. [11]. More specifically, we have received a message where our model has
been used, with success, to analyse data from UK, USA, NY City, Spain, and
Mumbai City. We stress the fact that this manuscript deals with the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 until May 16, 2020, as the objective of this work is to study the
effect of the strict lockdown measures. After May 2020, these measures have
been modified by the various Governments, which have decided to introduce
less heavy and much less restrictive lockdown measures5 .
5 The study of the the dynamics of COVID-19 when the population has been subject to less
restrictive measures is beyond the scope of this work and it will be matter of future works.

Modelling the COVID-19 - Virus’ growth

The objective of this section is to determine the coefficients of the evolutionary
differential equation for the COVID-19 (see the forthcoming Eq. (13)). We
also determine the generic analytical expression for the time-dependent number
of infected people through fitting techniques validated by the χ2 tests. This
expression is proposed after having previously analysed 12 respiratory infectious
diseases caused by viruses [10], in addition of being solution to the Richard’s
differential equation.

2.1

General background

Letting N represent population size and t represent time, the Logistic model
model is formalised by the differential equation below:

N
dN
= αN 1 −
dt
K

(7)

where α > 0 defines the grow rate and K > 0 is the carrying capacity. In this
equation, the early, unimpeded growth rate is modelled by the first term +αN .
The value of the rate α represents the proportional increase of the population
N in one unit of time. Later, if the system is closed (i.e. the system is isolated
and, hence, not in contact with a reservoir allowing the system to exchange
individuals), as the population grows the modulus of the second term, −αN 2 /K,
becomes almost as large as the first, until to saturating the exponential growth.
This antagonistic effect is called the bottleneck, and is modelled by the value of
the parameter K. The competition diminishes the combined growth rate, until
the value of N ceases to grow (this is called maturity of the population). The
solution of Eq. (7) is
K
N (t) =
(8)
1 + B exp (−t/τ )
where B > 0 is a constant related to the value of N (0). It is more convenient
to rewrite Eq. (8) in terms of the initial Logistic time t0L defined as
t0L = τ log B

(9)

So, Eq. (8) may be cast into the form
N (t) =

K
1 + exp (−(t − t0L )/τ )

(10)

where τ is linked to the steepness of the curve. Since the environmental conditions influence the carrying capacity, as a consequence it can be time-varying,
with K(t) > 0, leading to the following mathematical model (see, for example,
[12]):

where ν > 0 affects near which asymptote maximum growth occurs. The phenomenological logistic function is used to model the evolution of the COVID-19
pandemic in different Countries. The logistic model is mainly used in epidemiology and provides insights into the transmission dynamics of the virus. We
note, however, to evaluate the dynamics of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, more
refined models are needed, which take into account specific measures adopted
in each Country [14]. So, let us suppose that the Government decides to adopt
the lockdown measures. After the application of the lockdown measures the

2.2

Determination of the Carrying Capacity and the Lockdown Coefficient for the COVID-19

According to ref. [15]6 Respiratory viruses remain quiet for months, inactive but
viable, within living cells. Then suddenly they activate and become virulent as
they say, the infectious capacity grows to a maximum, after which it decreases.
The time duration is about of 2 or 3 months. So we can expect that the epidemic
will soon die out in Italy too. So, there is no valid reason to think that this coronavirus behaves differently from others [15]. The present work starts from the
following hypothesis: the SARS-CoV-2 behaves like the other viruses that cause
respiratory diseases. As a consequence, for the COVID-19 case, functions K(t)
and c(t) are determined by performing several fittings on the growth rate-trends
of infection capacity of the viruses that mainly affect the respiratory system.
More specifically, we considered the following 13 different diseases caused by
12 different viruses: Whooping Cough (Pertussis), Swine Flu (H1N1), Bird Flu
(Avian Flu H5N1), Enterovirus, Flu in Children, Flu in Adults, Bacterial Pneumonia, Viral Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Common Cold (Head Cold), Severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS), and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome).
In all the examined cases, we took into account the fact that the therapy-induced
death rate is greater than the baseline proliferation rate, then there is the eradication of the disease. In other words, for the above-mentioned cases the function

where he helped to found, dealt with childhood respiratory diseases, and studied bronchiolitis
in particular. In these days he has studied (with his collaborators) the data available on
SARS-CoV-2 in China, in South Korea and now in Italy.

c(t) in Eq. (13) represents the therapy-induced death rate [16]-[24]. Of course,
this is an oversimplified model of both the growth and the therapy (e.g., it does
not take into account the phenomenon of clonal resistance). We empirically
noticed (according to the χ2 test) that all these viruses have in common the
same growth rate-trend of infected people (of course, each of these behaviours
have their own growth rate parameters). In particular, we get that the trends
of the total number of infected people by respiratory viruses (indicated with
N ), subject to the therapy-induced death rate, versus time satisfy the following

(15)

is referred to as the average therapy-induced death rate. In our case the term
−c(t)N in the dynamic equation represents the lockdown measures. The lockdown is mainly based on the isolation of the susceptible individuals, eventually
with the removal of infected people by hospitalisation7 . In the idealised case,
for αb
t2 > 1, c(t) may be modelled as a linear function of b
t, by getting
c(t) ' αb
t

(16)

As for the epidemiological explanations relating to the various modelling of
c(t) (constant, linear in time etc.), we refer the reader to the well-known and
extensive literature on the subject (see, for example, Ref [25] or to the references
cited in [26]). Here, we limit ourselves to give a very intuitive explanation on the
physical meaning of this contribution. Immediately after the lockdown measures
have been adopted, i.e. during the very first initial phase, we expect that c(t̂)
is practically constant in time, as these measures have not yet been able to act
effectively. However, after a short period of time, the positive effects of the
lockdown measures become increasingly efficient and it is intuitive to expect a
linear growth of c(b
t) in time. More specifically, we expect that, after a short
transition period the coefficient c(t) starts to grow linearly in time. Successively,
at the leading order, c(b
t) will be equal in magnitude to the coefficient of the
linear term (in order to balance the growth rate induced by the linear term).
This because the lockdown measures will be able to satuarte the exponential
growth. Briefly, we expect that the O.D.E. governing the dynamics of the SARSCoV-2 is of the form (14) where c(b
t) ' αb

t > 1/α1/2 . Indeed, for values of
7 It is worth mentioning that initially England did not adopt any lockdown measures believing that the British system be a closed system. Basically, it was believed that the system be
governed by a simply logistic equation with a carrying capacity decreasing in time. However,
contrary to the expectations, in England the carrying capacity did not decrease in time. This
induced the British government to adopt the lockdown measures.

10

time b
t ' 1, the lockdown term in Eq. (14) is able to balance the exponential
grow, which is in agreement with our intuitive expectations.
From Eq. (14) we get that the time derivative of N vanishes for N = Ns , with
Ns satisfying the equation

Ns

(17)

By taking into account the inequality reported in Eq. (15), we get that the

Parameters KN and α depend on the virus in question and on the external
conditions (e.g. in our case, the lockdown measures) to which the population is
subject. In Eq. (14), the term −N 2 /KN is the term that tends to saturate the
exponential growth. KN is constant (or decreases) in the course of time since
the non-linear contribution becomes more and more important until saturating
the exponential growth. In our model, the carrying capacity is kept constant.
For large values of the carrying capacity, the solutions of Eq. (14) reach the
plateau at the time t̂M ax given, approximatively, by the expression

systems having a large carrying capacity, the solution of Eq. (14) is well approximated by the expression

Notice that the determination of the O.D.E. (14) is of a fundamental importance
if we wish also to describe the stochastic process (and the associated FokkerPlanck equation) where a white noise is added to this O.D.E. According to the
literature nomenclature, we refer to the differential equation (14) as COVID-19

2.3

Comparison between the Theoretical Predictions and
Experimental Data

For Italy and Belgium one observes two distinct phases related to the dynamics
of the COVID-19, which we classify as before the adoption of the lockdown
measures and after some days after the adoption of the lockdown measures.
The question therefore naturally arises, of whether these two types of regime
are separated by a well-defined transition. We shall see that this is indeed the
case. We may identify three different periods, which may be classified as follows:
1. The exponential period. As seen in Section 1, before the adoption of lockdown measures, the exponential trend is the intrinsic behaviour of the grow

rate of the COVID-19. In this period the doubling time µ is a constant
parameter versus time.
2. The transient period. The transient period starts after having applied the
severe lockdown measures. In this period we observe a sort of oscillations
(or fluctuations) of µ versus time. In this case the time variation of µ(t)
reflects the behaviour of the time effective reproduction number, R(t), defined as the number of cases generated in the current state of a population,
which does not have to be the uninfected state. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show the
behaviour of the parameter µ versus time for Italy and Belgium, respectively. The transient period ends when the last step of the exponential
trend fits real data as good as the linear trend9 .
3. The bell-shaped period (or the post-transient period ). In the bell-shaped
period parameter µ is a (typical) function of time obtained by using
Eq. (14). Several theoretical models can be used to study the posttransient period (e.g., by using Gompertz’s law [28]). Here, we use two
mathematical models: the solution of the differential equation (14) and
the logistic model (see, for example, Ref. [16]), and we compare these two
theoretical models with real data for Italy and Belgium.
Figures (8), (9), and (16) (see Appendix) compare the predictions of our model
(blue lines) against the logistic model (red lines) for Italy, Belgium, and Luxembourg, respectively. Notice that the number of free parameters of these two
models are exactly the same, since τ and α cannot be chosen arbitrarily. More
specifically,
a) The logistic model possesses two free parameters : K and t0L . Notice that
parameter τ is not free since it is linked to the doubling time µ;
b) Also our model possesses two free parameter: KN and t0 . Notice that
parameter α is linked to the doubling time µ (see Eqs (14) and (20)).
Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 compare the theoretical predictions, with the experimental
data for Italy and Belgium updated to the 15th of May 2020. The values of the
parameters τ , KN , and t0 for Eq. (14) and the parameters τ , t0 and K for the
logistic function are reported in the figure captions. As we can see, for both
Countries Eq. (14) fits well all the real data from the initial days, while the
logistic model applies only to the first data. The curves reach the plateau at
the time tM ax given by Eq. (19). By inserting the values of the parameters, we
get
tM axIT ' 80 days and tM axBE ' 60 days
(24)
corresponding to tM axIT ' 21 April 2020 and tM axBE ' 2 May 2020 for Italy
and Belgium, respectively.
9 A numerical condition may be established by using the χ2 test: the fittings of the two
trends are considered both good if, for example, for both trends, the χ2 -tests get values ≥ 0.9.

Modelling the COVID-19 - The Descending
Phase

Here, for the descending phase is intended the phase where the number of the
positive cases starts to decrease10 . So, our model cannot be used for describing
also the descending phase since Nt is the number of the total cases and, during
the descending phase, Nt tends to reach the plateau. The objective of this section
is to determine the trend of the curve of positive people during the descending
phase. This task is accomplished by establishing the appropriate equations
for the recovered people and the deceased people for COVID-19. During the
descent phase the number of active people over time must satisfy a conservation
equation. This allows determining the time- evolution for the positive people.
10 We define the number of positive people as the number of people tested positive for COVID19, hence, by excluding the number of the deceased people and the number of people who
recovered.

days), KN
(µBE = 3.7 days), KBE = 111000, t0LBE = 39.5 days for the Logistic function,
respectively. The zone I corresponds to the period before the adoption of the
lockdown measures.
In the sequel, we denote with rt , dt , and nt the number of people released from
the hospital at the time t, the total deaths, and the number of positive individuals
at time t, respectively11

3.1

Number of the Recovered People

We start with the recovered people previously hospitalised. Let us suppose that
a hospital has 50 patients in intensive therapy, corresponding to its maximum
availability capacity. If the hospital is unable to heal any patient, the growth rate
of healed people is necessarily equal to zero. On the other hand, if the hospital
is able to heal a certain number of people, the places previously occupied by
11 We draw the attention of the reader that in this manuscript N (capital letter) represents
t
the number of the total cases at time t, whereas nt (small letter) refers to the number of the
positive individuals at time t.

15

the sick people will free and other patients affected by COVID-19 will be able
to be hospitalised. In the latter case, the growth rate of the healed people will
rise thanks to the fact that the hospital is able to heal more and more patients.
This initial phase may be modelled by introducing into the dynamic equation
the term +γr(t), with r(t) indicating the number of the recovered people at the
time t, previously hospitalised
drt
= ζrt
(25)
dt
However, it is reasonable to suppose that ζ is constant for low values of rt ,
whereas, when rt takes more and more large values, ζ is proportional to Ir ,
with Ir denoting the number of the infected people entering in the hospital
(and not the total number of the infected people, which is indicated with nt ).
Hence,
ζ = αr − βr Ir > 0
(26)
The sign minus in Eq. (26) is due to the fact that the recovered people will
continue to grow linearly until when it reaches a maximum limit i.e. until when
the hospital is no longer able to accept other sick people; this causes a reduction
of people who recover. The competition between these two effects diminishes
the combined growth rate. Hence,
αr
(27)
Ir <
βr
where βr is linked to the hospital’s capacity to accept sick people12 . To sum up,
drt
= αr r(t) − βr Ir (t − θ)r(t)
dt

where Ir (t − θ) = r(t) + Dr (t + θ1 ) (28)

r(t) is the number of the recovered people, previously hospitalised, at the time
t who have been infected, in average, at the time t − θ and Dr (t + θ1 ) denotes
the number of deceased people at the hospital at the time t + θ1 who have been
infected, in average, at the time t − θ (in general, θ1 6= 0).
Clearly, the number of the recovered people, previously hospitalised, at the step
n (i.e. rn ), is linked to the total number of the recovered people previously
hospitalised at the step n (denoted by hn ) by the relation
n=t/∆t

rn = hn − hn−1

or ht =

X

rn

(with ∆t ' 1 day)

(29)

n=1

where we have set h0 = 0.
3.1.1

Approximated O.D.E. for the Recovered People Previously
Hospitalised

We assume that all the infected people entering in the hospitals will heal. So
Dr (t + θ1 ) ≈ 0
12 Indeed,

hence Ir (t − θ) ' r(t)

βr is proportional to the inverse of the hospital capacity.

16

(30)

The final O.D.E. for the recovered people reads then

drt
1 
' αr 1 −
rt rt
dt
Kr

(31)

where Kr is the hospital’s capacity, which we assume to be a time-independent
parameter. Notoce that, under this approximation, the equation for the number
of recovered people is in itself and independent of the equations for the other
variables (i.e. for nt and dt )13 .
3.1.2

O.D.E. for the Total Recovered People

At the first approximation, the O.D.E. for the total recovered people Rt (i.e. the
total individuals having survived the disease) is trivially obtained by considering
that the rate of Rt is approximatively proportional to the number of the infected
people nt at time t i.e.14 .
dRt
= χnt
(32)
dt
However, it is useful to clarify the following. In Eqs (29), ht stands for the
total number of the recovered people previously hospitalised whereas the variable
Rt in Eq. (32) is the total number of the recovered people (i.e. the number of
the recovered people previously hospitalised, plus the number of the asymptomatic people, plus the infected people who have been recovered without being
previously hospitalised). The natural question is: ”how can we count Rt and
compare this variable with the real data ?”. The current statistics, produced by
the Ministries of Health of various Countries, concern the people released from
the hospitals. Apart from Luxembourg (where the entire population has been
subject to the COVID-19-test), no other Countries are in a condition to provide
statistics regarding the total people recovered by COVID-19. Hence, it is our
opinion that the equation for Rt , is not useful since it is practically impossible
to compare Rt with the experimental data.

3.2

Equation for the Deceased People

The rate of deceased people per unit time is modelled by the following dimensionless equation
d
dt = αd n(t−td ) − βd n2(t−td )
(33)
dt̂
The meaning of Eq. (33) is the following. Manifestly, the rate of deaths is
proportional to the number of active people. However, individuals infected by
13 Eq. (31) models a hospital’s ability to heal people and, by no means, it must be linked
to the number of people tested positive for COVID-19 or to the mortality rate caused by the
SARS-CoV-2.
14 Notice that Eq. (32) is the dynamic equation for the total recovered people adopted
in the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased-Model (SIRD-model) [29]. The comparison
between our model with the SIRD-model will be found soon in Ref. [30].

17

SARS-CoV-2 do not die instantly since the rate of deaths at time t is proportional to the people who were infected at an earlier time t − td (td > 0) with td
denoting the time-delay. We indicate with αd the, time-independent, constant
proportional to the increase of the deaths dt . The second term, −βd n2(t−td ) ,
models the presence of the lockdown measures, having the effect of saturating
the rate of infected people and, consequently, of deaths. Indeed, in the absence
of lockdown measures, we may approximatively write
d
dt = αr n(t−td )
dt̂

(34)

with αr denoting a positive constant. The purpose of the lockdown measures
is to decrease the number of infected people, and therefore deaths. We may
assume that the effect of the lockdown measures is proportional to n(t−td ) such
as to dampen the linear growth of the mortality rate. In other terms, we get
αr → αr − βr n(t−td )

(35)

which combined with Eq. (34) gives Eq. (33).

3.3

Equation for the Positive People

Of course, during the descent phase, the number of active people nt satisfies a
simple law of conservation: If we are in the situation where there are no longer
new cases of people tested positive for COVID-19 and if we assume that the
active people cannot leave their country of origin (or else, if they do, they will
be rejected by the host Country), then the number of infected people cannot but
decrease either because some people are deceased or because others have been
recovered. In mathematical terms
nt = n0 − (ht − h0 ) − (dt − d0 ) = NM ax − ht − dt

(36)

with h0 , d0 and n0 denoting the values of ht , dt and nt evaluated at the time
t = tM ax (see Eq. (19) i.e., the time that maximises the number of the total
cases), respectively. It should be noted that the conservation law (36) applies
only when there are no longer new cases of people tested positive to COVID1915 . Here, by the descending phase we mean the phase where Eq. (36) applies.
15 So, Eq. (36) does not apply necessarily as soon as the number n (the number of people
t
tested positive for COVID-19) starts to decrease. Indeed, it may happen that nt decreases
because, for example, the number of new cases of people tested positive is less than the number
of the people who have recovered in the meantime. Conservation law (36) applies only from
the moment where the number of new cases of people tested positive is strictly equal to zero.

A similar analysis for Luxembourg is reported in Appendix.

Theoretical Predictions for the Descending Phase

In this subsection, we report the numerical solutions of Eqs (37)-(38) for Italy
and Belgium. The solution for Luxembourg can be found in the Appendix.
Fig. (10) and (11) concern the Italian situation. They show the numerical
solution of Eqs (37)-(38) for the number of recovered people and deaths, respectively. These theoretical predictions are plotted against the experimental data
reported in the Table (1). According to the theoretical predictions, for Italy we
get tIT d = 12 days. Fig. (12), illustrates the descendant-phase for Italy.
Figs (13) and (14) refer to the Belgian situation. The figures illustrate the
numerical solutions of Eqs (37)-(38) for the number of recovered people and
deaths, respectively. The theoretical predictions are plotted against the experimental data reported in the Table (3). According to the theoretical predictions,

Conclusions

In this work we studied the spread of SARS-CoV-2 until when the strict lockdown measures have been adopted (i.e. until 16th May 200). The dynamics of
21

COVID-19 when the population is under less restrictive lockdown measures will
be subject of future studies. Through fitting techniques previously performed,
and validated by the χ2 -tests, we determined a general differential equation, having two-free parameters, which we propose for 13 respiratory infectious diseases
caused by viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The solution of Eq. (14) provides
the number of the total case in time. Successively, we compared the theoretical predictions, provided by the solution of Eq. (14) and by the logistic model
(see Eq. (7)), with the real data for Italy and Belgium (for Luxembourg see
Appendix). We saw that the solution of Eq. (14) is in good agreement with the
experimental data since the beginning of the appearance of the COVID-19; this
is not the case for the logistic model which applies only to the few last days. We
found the days where the maximum number infected people by COVID-19 will
be reached in Italy and Belgium by parametrising the solution of Eq. (14) with
experimental data: we get, tM axIT ' 21 April 2020 and tM axBE ' 2 May 2020
for Italy and Belgium, respectively.
We also noted, empirically, that the infection process caused by SARS-CoV-2
may be divided into three qualitatively different periods; i.e., the exponential
period, the transient period and the bell-shaped period (or the post-transient
period ). The solution of Eq. (14) allows defining more precisely these three
periods. Indeed, we may classify the above periods as follows
The exponential period

with b
tLM indicating the dimensionless time when the lockdown measures are
applied and b
tf lex the dimensionless inflection point of the solution of Eq. (14),
respectively. It is easily checked that, for large values of KN , the value of t̂f lex
satisfies, approximatively, the equation
tf lex
(41)
αb
t3f lex − 2αb
t2f lex + (α − 3)b
tf lex + 2 ' 0 with b
tf lex ≡
t0
Hence, according to Eq. (41), the transient period ended on 31 March 2020 for
Italy and on 7 April 2020 for Belgium, respectively. The second part of the work
is devoted to modelling the descending phase, i.e. the decrease of the number
of people tested positive for COVID-19. Also in this case, we proposed a new
set of dynamic differential equations that we solved numerically. The solution
of Eqs (37) (and Eq. (38)) provided valuable information such as the duration
of the COVID-19 epidemic in a given Country and therefore when it will be
possible to return to normal life.

Appendix: Comparison between the Theoretical Predictions of Eq. (14) and Experimental
Data for Luxembourg

Luxembourg, due to the particularly severe lockdown measures adopted by the
government, may be considered, with good approximation, as a closed system
(628108 inhabitants, most of them concentrated in only one town). Indeed,
right from the start, the city of Luxembourg was literally closed and citizens
were unable to enter and leave the city freely (people who had to enter in the
city for working reasons were obliged to undergo each time the test that, of
course, had to result negative).
Italy, on the other hand may be considered, with a good approximation, as
an open system (60317116 inhabitants dislocated in all the Country). In Italy,
especially during the initial phase, the citizens of northern Italy moved freely to
the south of Italy, by train, by plans or by car. Only in a second time the Italian
government decided to introduce much more restrictive measures concerning the
movement of citizens from one region to another.
For the reason mentioned above, it is our opinion that it is very interesting to
analyse these two Countries, Luxembourg and Italy, which are so different with
each other. In this Appendix we report the comparison between the theoretical
predictions of the COVID-19 model (14) and the real data for Luxembourg
update to 15 May 2020 (see Fig. (16)). In the columns of table (5) we can find
the number of active people (currently infected by SARS-CoV-2), the number
of recovered people, and the number of deceased people, respectively. The
experimental data have been found in the databases [31] and [32]. Luxembourg
reached its peak on 12 April 2020.

The Descending Phase for Luxembourg

Figs (17) and (18) refer to the Luxembourg situation. The figures illustrate
the numerical solutions of Eqs (37)-(38) for the number of recovered people
and deaths, respectively. The theoretical predictions are plotted against the
experimental data, which can be found in the Table (5). Fig. (19) shows the
descending phase for Luxembourg.
