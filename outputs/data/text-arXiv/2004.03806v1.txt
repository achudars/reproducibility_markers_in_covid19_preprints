Abstract
Here after performing docking and molecular dynamics of various small
molecules derived as a secondary metabolite from fungi, we propose Flaviolin to
act as potent inhibitor of 3-chymotrypsin (3C) like protease (3CLpro) of noval
corona virus SARS-CoV2 responsible for pandemic condition caused by
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Keywords: 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro); SARS-CoV-2 novel corona virus; Fungal
metabolites; Docking; Molecular Dynamics Simulation

The onset of 2020 witnessed the world brought to a virtual standstill with the outbreak of a novel
severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID
2019) pandemic of the 21st century began as an outbreak in China in 2019 and soon, it overwhelmed
the world, ultimately leading the World Health Organization to declare it as a global pandemic in
March 2020. As on 28th March 2020, more than 500,000 confirmed cases in 202 countries were
infected with the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus with more than 23,000 deaths globally. With no apparent
approved or clinically tested anti-viral drug for SARS-CoV, the race to find an efficient therapeutic
has become the primary motive for the affected nations(de Wit, van Doremalen, Falzarano, &
Munster, 2016; Jin, Du, Xu, Deng, Liu, Zhao, Zhang, Li, Zhang, Peng, et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020;
Zhou et al., 2020).
The genome of coronaviruses contains 25 to 32 kb, which encodes two large and overlapping
polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are vital for the replication, transcription and therefore the
proliferation of the virus within the host. The functional polypeptide is acted upon by virally encoded
3-chymotrypsin (3C) like protease (3CLpro), known as main protease. Though, 3CLpro is a dimer,
which provides the substrate binding cleft, the protease carries out its proteolytic activity by the
nucleophilic attack guided by cysteine thiol in its Cys-His dyad. Owing to the vitality of 3CLpro in
realizing the viral life cycle and the absence of its human analogue, 3CLpro is a prime target for the
design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug design(Jin, Du, Xu, Deng, Liu, Zhao, Zhang, Li, Zhang, Peng, et
al., 2020; Jin, Du, Xu, Deng, Liu, Zhao, Zhang, Li, Zhang, & Peng, 2020; F. Wang, Chen, Tan, Yang,
& Yang, 2016).
In the present study, hundred secondary metabolites of fungi were screened virtually to assess its
molecular docking with 3CLpro in silico. The natural chemical compounds/fungal metabolites were
screened based on their in-silico binding energy, formation of hydrogen bonds to 3CLpro. Flaviolin

2

was found to be the most ideal compound to bind with 3CLpro, which was corroborated with
molecular dynamics study of the flabiolin-3CLpro complex for 1000 ps. The stability of the complex
could possibly pave a path for identifying/realizing the anti-3CLpro mode of action of Flaviolin. The
protein 3CLpro was retrieved from Protein databank (PDB), ID 7LU6. The protein was co-crystallized
with its cognate ligand, N3 (PubChem CID: 6323191). The co-ordinates of N3 binding site on 3CLpro
were determined using UCSF Chimera (version 1.14).

The protein structure was prepared for

docking by addition of H-bonds and removal of all the co-crystallized residues (Figure 1). The energy
minimization step was performed out using DockPrep tool (Krivov, Shapovalov, & Dunbrack, 2009).
AM1-BCC method, known for its promptness in assigning charges to the molecules, was employed
using ANTECHAMBER algorithm. while assigning the charges (J. Wang, Wang, Kollman, & Case,
2001). Energy minimization was performed using 500 steepest descent steps with 0.02 A° step size
with an update interval of 10. All the steps mentioned were performed in Chimera.
The fungal secondary metabolites, ligands, were retrieved from PubChem for the in-silico
interaction assays. Prior to the molecular docking of ligand and receptor, all ligands were optimized
by addition of hydrogen and energy minimization using Gasteiger algorithm (Gasteiger & Jochum,
1979) in structure editing wizard of Chimera, which works on the chemoinformatic principle of
electronegativity equilibration and the files were saved in mol2 format.

of COVID-19.

Receptor-ligand docking analysis was performed using AutoDock Vina (Trott & Olson, 2010) and
the program was executed as an add-on in Chimera. The ligand binding site in 3CLpro was selected
based on the crystallized cognate ligand (N3), attached in the original pdb file and the co-ordinates
were recorded for docking of fungal ligands. Further, the coordinates of hydrophobic cavity of 3CLpro
active site was used in the docking of N3 (as control) and the fungal metabolites.
In the AutoDock Vina algorithm, the following parameters were set as: (i) number of binding
modes- 10; (ii) exhaustiveness of search- 8 and (iii) maximum energy difference- 3 kcal/mol. Out of
all the possible poses suggested by AutoDock Vina, the pose showing maximum hydrogen bonds and
minimum binding free energy change (kcal/mol), as represented in the ViewDock window, were
chosen. They were further analysed in Biovia Discovery Studio (DS) visualizer for the formation of
hydrogen bonds, in addition to other supporting hydrophobic interactions, by the functional groups of
ligands with the amino acids of 3CLpro. The metabolite (ligand) making maximum number of Hbonds, showing capability to form covalent interaction with 3CLpro and showed highest binding
affinity was chosen for further study using molecular dynamics simulation.

and hydrophobic interactions with protein.

The structure analysis of SARS-CoV2 3CLpro shows that, the substrate binding site is located in
the Cys-His catalytic dyad. Domain I extend from residues 8 to 101 and Domain II ranges from
residues 102 to 184 comprise of antiparallel β-barrel structure. Domain residues is formed from
residue 201 to 303 and possess five α-helices arranged into a largely antiparallel globular cluster,
which is connected to domain II means of a long loop region extending from residue 185 to 200. For
COVID-19, the substrate binding site is located in the cleft between Domain I and II. Binding of N3
with 3CLpro shows that it binds in the substrate binding pocket in (Figure 1). N3 is relatively a large
molecule where its backbone forms an antiparallel sheet with residues 164 to168 (His164, Glu166,
Met165, Leu167, Pro168) of 3CLpro while also interacting with residues 189 to191 (Gln189, Thr190,
Ala191) of the loop that links Domain II and III.

The group of scientists who co-crystalized this protein with N3 also suggest strong covalent bond
formed by Cys145 of 3CLpro with N3 of the 1.8 Å length, in turn, making the interaction with of this
inhibitor bind irreversibly with the protein. Briefly, the inhibitor N3 makes six hydrogen bonds (with
Gly143, Phe140, His163, His164, Glu166 and Thr190), one amide pi-stacked interaction (with
Leu141), five pi-alkyl interactions (with His41, Met49, Leu167, Pro168 and Ala191) two carbon
hydrogen bonds (Met165 and His172) and one van der Walls interactions (with Asn142) with 3CL pro.
For the docking of fungal metabolites with 3CLpro, the coordinates of N3 binding were used to assess
the binding affinity of various fungal metabolites with 3CLpro. On performing the docking of all the
metabolites one by one with 3CLpro, it was observed that, only five molecules were able to make three
hydrogen bonds or more with 3CLpro at the binding cleft of N3. These were Asperic acid, Aspernigrin
A, Aurosperone B, Carbomymethyl-3-hexylmaleic acid and the best one, flaviolin. Flaviolin showed
to make eight hydrogen bonds in total (with Leu141, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, His163, Glu166 and
Gln189) and made one carbon hydrogen bond (with Asn142) and the docking energy as predicted by
AutoDock Vina was -7.3 kcal/mol for the best pose (Figure 2). As shown previously, N3 showed
interaction with residues 164 to168 (His164, Glu166, Met165, Leu167, Pro168) of 3CL pro along with
interacting with residues 189 to191 (Gln189, Thr190, Ala191) of the loop that links Domain II and
III, flaviolin also showed similar interaction with 3CLpro. All these properties make flaviolin as the
best choice as the most suitable inhibitor for 3CLpro. When the docked best pose of flaviolin was
made to superimpose with that of N3 on 3CLpro, it was observed that it was able to bind exactly at
the same N3 binding cleft (Figure 1). Moreover, the docking analysis suggested that flaviolin
interacted with almost all similar amino acids akin to N3-3CLpro binding.
Further, to validate the results of docking, the comparative molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was
performed in two pairs of experiments studying (i) N3-3CLpro and (ii) Flaviolin-3CLpro individually
and their results were compared. Steepest descent energy minimization was performed for both the
systems, and the systems were equilibrated under NVT (constant number of particles, volume and
temperature) conditions for 1000 ps at 300 K, and the MD run was initiated. Once the NVT run was
completed the system was proceeded with NPT (constant number of particles, pressure, and
temperature) simulation and MD run was performed for 1000 ps. Trajectories were analysed for rootmean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg) and
the number of H-bonds formed between the ligand and proteins using ‘gmx rms’,’gmx rmsf’, ‘gmx
gyrate’ and ‘gmx hbond’ of GROMACS utilities (Bekker et al., 1993; Pronk et al., 2013). Ligand–
protein stability was determined by the dynamics of hydrogen bonds between ligand and protein with
respect to time. XMgrace tool was used to prepare the graphs (Turner, Land-Margin Research, &
Technology, 2005).

The RMSD values for the backbone of proteins in presence of both the ligands, 3CL pro was found
to be more stable in presence of flaviolin as compared to N3. Though, on stabilization of the system
after 500 ps of MD run, the RMSD values were almost equal (Figure 4a). Radius of gyration (Rg)
was determined to understand the level of compaction in the structure of 3CLpro in the presence of N3
and Flaviolin. The Rg is defined as the mass weighted root mean square distance of a collection of
atoms from their common center of mass. Hence this analysis gives us the overall dimensions of the
protein. The calculated Rg values over the simulation time scale for (i) N3-3CLpro and (ii) Flaviolin3CLpro are shown in Figure 4b. The Rg value of N3-3CLpro and Flaviolin-3CLpro varies between 2.192
nm and 2.190 nm. From the Rg plot, it shows that Flaviolin-3CLpro has marginally lower Rg values,
however the difference cannot be considered significant. This suggest the protein behave identical in
presence of N3 and Flaviolin.
The RMSF with respect to the average MD simulation conformation reflects as a mean portraying
flexibility differences among residues. The RMSF of the backbone atoms of each residue in the (i)
N3-3CLpro and (ii) Flaviolin-3CLpro individually is calculated to reveal the flexibility of the backbone
structure in presence of both ligands. This shows how the protein behaves in presence of different
ligands. The high RMSF value indicates more flexibility whereas the low RMSF value indicates
limited movements during simulation in relation to its average position. The RMSF of the protein
backbone 3CLpro in presence of both the ligands N3 and Flaviolin were almost identical suggesting
similar affinity of binding with the protein. If the binding is poor than the protein is freer to hive
higher RMSF values, which is not the case here (Figure 5c, d). While the RMSF of the ligands N3
and Flaviolin is shown in Figure 5e and f respectively. As both the ligands are differing in size and
shapes, comparing their RMSF doesn’t hold any importance.
The intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the protein and the ligand plays an essential role in
stabilizing the protein–ligand complexes. The stability of the hydrogen bond network formed between
(i) N3-3CLpro and (ii) Flaviolin-3CLpro were calculated throughout the simulation at 300 K for the
ligated system and the results are depicted in Figure 5e and f. The N3-3CLpro complex exhibited four
hydrogen H-bonds upto 500ps and thereafter the number of hydrogen bond increased to the average
of six suggesting the ligand getting more stable during the course of MD run. While for Flaviolin3CLpro, there were consistently six hydrogen bonds being formed throughout the simulation. Overall
scenario suggests both ligands fits in to the binding cleft making appropriate hydrogen bonds.
From the MD analysis it can be said that the protein behaves identical in presence of both the
ligands, N3 and Flaviolin both forms similar hydrogen bonds with 3CLpro and hence the efficacy of
Flaviolin to interact with 3CLpro can be depicted to be at par with N3.

The pkCSM - pharmacokinetics server (Pires, Blundell, & Ascher, 2015) was used to
predict the ADMET (absorption–distribution–metabolism–excretion–toxicity) properties of
N3 and flaviolin. It predicted both physiochemical and pharmacological properties. SMILES
(Simplified Molecule Input Line Entry Specification) of the compounds were retrieved from
PubChem and uploaded to pkCSM - pharmacokinetics server (Table 1). Of all the tests,
Flaviolin showed better distribution based on the values of volume of Distribution (VDss).
Flaviolin also showed fraction unbounded showing its ability to distribute in tissues of body
more effectively. Flaviolin does not even interfere the Cytochrome (CYP) and has better renal
clearance. Lastly the toxicity by Flaviolin on liver cells is also not predicted and hence it has

9

better drug like properties when compared to N3. With efforts been made to control the
pandemics of SAR-CoV2 in the form of novel coronavirus, to find the lead compound against
the target protein that can suppress its.
Reflecting back in the history, fungal metabolites have been a boon for the mankind,
starting from antibiotics to flavoring agents to food preservatives. Fungi are known to produce
large amounts of secondary metabolites and by chance that might interact with 3CLpro, with
this rationale the fungal metabolites were looked for pursuing this research. Previously, the
potentials of fungal metabolites as anti-viral agents are explored and the success was
promising. The anti-viral compounds from fungal origin is vividly described by Linnakoski et
al. (2018) where the promising anti-viral compounds portrayed were belong to the chemical
class of Indole alkaloids, Non-ribosomal peptides, Polyketides, Terpenoids. With efforts been
made to control the pandemic of SAR-CoV2 in the form of novel Coronavirus, to find a lead
compound against the target protein that can suppress its. We here are proposing Flaviolin to
interact with one of the important target proteins of SAR-CoV2, 3CLpro and block its function
as deduced using docking and molecular dynamics.
