A BSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus the need to understand respiratory virus
transmission mechanisms. In preparation for an anticipated influenza pandemic, a substantial body of
literature has developed over the last few decades showing that the short-range aerosol route is an
important, though often neglected transmission path. We develop a simple mathematical model for
COVID-19 transmission via aerosols, apply it to known outbreaks, and present quantitative guidelines
for ventilation and occupancy in the workplace.

Introduction

The world is learning to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic
and a great deal of information about the disease is already
available [1, 2, 3]. In order to adjust to this new reality
it is important to understand what can be done to avoid
infection, and to avoid infecting others.
SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus which causes COVID-19,
is thought to be transmitted via droplets, surface contamination and aerosols [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. COVID-19
outbreaks are most common in indoor spaces [11], and
evidence points to a dominant role of aerosol transmission
[12, 13]. Furthermore, infection via inhalation of aerosols
and small droplets dominates large droplet exposure in
most cases for physical reasons linked to complex, but
well understood fluid dynamics [14, 15, 16, 17]. Despite
this fact, there is a common misconception that aerosol
transmission implies efficient long-range transmission (as
in measles), and thus that the absence of long-range transmission implies an absence of aerosol transmission. The
truth is more nuanced, and includes the possibility of a
dominant short-range aerosol path limited by pathogen
dilution, deposition, and decay [18, 19, 20].

2-3 in diameter and becoming “droplet nuclei”. These fine
particles settle slowly and mix with the air in the environment [23, 24, 25].
Aerosol transmission happens when a susceptible individual inhales these now sub-20 µm droplet nuclei that are
suspended in the air around them [26, 27]. This is thought
to be the dominant transmission mechanism for influenza
and rhinovirus [26, 28] and possibly also for SARS and
MERS [29]. For influenza, it has been shown that aerosol
particles as small as 1.5 µm are sufficient for transmission
[30]. Furthermore, it is known from other viral respiratory
diseases that aerosol exposure can result in infection and
illness at much lower doses than other means (e.g., nasal
inoculation) [31].
In line with current recommendations [32], we will assume
that hand-hygiene protocols are being followed such that
surface contamination remains a sub-dominant transmission route [12, 9]. We will also assume that contagious
individuals are wearing some kind of face covering which
is sufficient to disrupt the momentum of any outgoing
airflow [33, 34] and catch large droplets [35]. These actions ensure that the aerosols investigated here remain the
dominant transmission mechanism.

In the following sections we present a simple model for

most of their water to evaporation, shrinking by a factor of

Risk Assessment

Rather than work explicitly with the probability of infection Pinf , we will use the ratio of the viral dose and the
infectivity
Dinf = ρ V /Ninf
(2)
as a proxy, and refer to it as the “infectious dose”. Note
that the infectivity and the viral concentration always appear together here, so only their ratio ρ/Ninf is important
in our model. While ρ has been measured for COVID-19
[37, 47], Ninf has not been directly measured. We estimate Ninf ∼ 1000 from influenza and other coronaviruses
[42, 48], and check this value by applying our model to
known outbreaks (see appendix A).

In this section we motivate the analysis that follows as a
foundation for guidelines based on the the probability that
a contagious individual will infect a coworker, Pinf , and
the absolute risk of infection during an epidemic such as
COVID-19. The later of these is not addressed directly
by the analysis presented in this work and depends on the
prevalence of highly-contagious (and presumably asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic) individuals in the population
[36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. In the context of the current COVID19 pandemic, a return to work seems improbable if more
than 1 in 1000 people are unwittingly contagious on any
given day. This suggests that the absolute probability of
infection should be less than Pinf /1000, since our calculations of Pinf assumes the presence of a contagious individual. An acceptable workplace transmission risk should
be chosen such that a contagious employee has only a
modest chance of infecting another employee during their
pre-symptomatic period, and such that the absolute risk of
infection remains acceptably low (e.g., less than 0.01% if
Pinf . 10%).

The relationship between Dinf and the probability of infection Pinf is shown in Fig. 1 (right). Equation 1 is shown
as the dashed-grey curve, indicating that the probability of
infection is high for any infectious dose greater than 1, and
Pinf is essentially proportional to Dinf when Dinf  1.
The other curves in Fig. 1 account for variability in ρ, V
and Ninf , as described in section 7.

A more quantifiable and meaningful approach to risk assessment can be derived from the relative risk of infection
by COVID-19 in the workplace vs. other locations, and
the associated contribution of the workplace to the growth
or decline of the epidemic (i.e., the reproduction number R0 ) [41]. The grander objective of ensuring that the
workplace’s contribution to the epidemic’s R0 is small
is sufficient to ensure that the relative risk of contracting
COVID-19 in the workplace is small compared with other
activities (e.g., homelife or recreation). A workplace transmission probability of 10%, for instance, would contribute
0.1 to R0 , meaning that for a decaying epidemic with
0.5 < R0 < 1, an employee would be 5 to 10 times more
likely to be infected away from work than at work.

In this section we compute the infectious dose which results from the presence of a contagious individual in various scenarios. This informs prescriptions for the maximum
time a susceptible individual may be exposed to potentially
contaminated air, or the minimum time between occupants
in the same space. Each of these calculations uses the
values in Table 1 and concludes with an exposure time
limit for a given infectious dose. The infectious dose limits
used here are chosen to maintain a transmission probability
less than 10%, as motivated in section 2 with examples in
section 7.
4.1

This relative view of risk assessment requires a somewhat
counter-intuitive approach to setting guidelines: the focus
should not be on limiting the probability that an employee
becomes infected, but rather on limiting the quantity of
pathogens delivered to others by a contagious and as-yetasymptomatic employee.

Aerosol infectious Dose Model

Steady State in a Room

A contagious individual will shed virions into the room
they occupy through breathing, talking, coughing, etc.
The aerosolized virion concentration in a room can be
expressed in the form of a differential equation as

Infection Model

The probability of developing an infection Pinf given exposure to a volume V of saliva with a concentration ρ of
virus particles (“virions”) is

Pinf = 1 − e−ρ V /Ninf
(1)
where the infectivity Ninf is the number of virions needed
to make infection likely in the lungs for aerosol inhalation
[21, 31, 42, 43, 20]. The infectivity value Ninf includes
probable deposition location (i.e., upper vs. lower respiratory tract) and local deposition efficiency (e.g., not all Some simplification can be achieved by using Eqn. 4 to

a mask-wearing cougher. The cough momentum will be
disrupted by the mask, but aerosols will exit the mask
on essentially all sides [34, 33, 22] resulting in a cloud
around the cougher that will then either move with local
air currents or rise with the cougher’s body plume [58].
We assume that large droplets are trapped in the cougher’s
mask or settle out around the cougher, while aerosols are
dispersed into the air around the cougher. The infectious

which suggests that an infection risk is still present at short
distances, even if the cougher is wearing a mask [59]. This
analysis is clearly oversimplified, as details of the cough,
the mask, and local air currents will all prevent isotropic
dispersion, but serves to emphasize that extra care should
be taken for transient events at short distances as they may
result in a significant infectious dose.

Close Encounters

Mixing of aerosols into an airspace may require a few
air-cycle times before a fairly uniform concentration can
be assumed [56, 57]. In order to understand the potential
infection risk associated with close proximity, we make

Mitigation Measures

5.2

HVAC and Portable Air Filters

Increasing air exchange rates in an HVAC system, and
avoiding recirculation can both be used to reduce aerosol
concentrations indoors. Consistent use of local ventilation
(e.g., bathroom fans) can also help to avoid infection. In
buildings and spaces where these measures are not available or not sufficient, local air filters (a.k.a., air scrubbers)
can be used to increase the introduction of clean air into

is greater than 1 µm, so special filtering technology is not

The first of these is the easiest to achieve: by disrupting any high-velocity outgoing pathogen-laden air flow
[34, 33, 60, 14, 17] and the capturing large droplets 5.3 Clean Rooms and HEPA Filters
[35, 61], masks of essentially any sort can limit direct

well-mixed aerosols.
The calculations in the previous section allow a variety
of possible mitigation measures. This section briefly describes some means of reducing the probability of aerosol
infection.

If the HEPA filters are part of a recirculating air cycle, Eqn.
14 can be used with fsys & 0.999, allowing for essentially
indefinite exposure times. It should be noted, however, that
HEPA filters require lower air-speeds than those offered
by typical HVAC systems and as such are not a “drop in
replacement” option.

Masks and respirators can reduce the probability of infection, both for the wearer and for the people they interact
with, by filtering the air inhaled and exhaled by the wearer
[41]. While improvised face coverings generally do not remove more than half of aerosolized particles on inhalation
(protection factor PF . 2) [61], surgical masks provide
some level of protection (PF of 2–10, typically around 3)
[62, 63]. Respirators which seal against the face are far
more effective protection for the wearer (e.g., PF of 8–80
for N95s) [64], but benefiting from them requires proper
fit and user compliance [65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70], which
suggests that widespread use is likely to be ineffective with
currently available respirators [71, 72, 68]

Laboratories that use portable clean rooms in large spaces
can be treated in a similar manner, using Eqn. 13 for the air
inside the clean room and Eqn. 10 to represent the clean
air supplied to the laboratory space outside the portable
clean room.
Any clean room environment is likely to provide sufficient
air flow to make aerosol infection very unlikely in the wellmixed approximation used in section 4. This will leave
close encounters, as described in section 4.4, as the dominant infection path. If there are multiple occupants in a
clean room they should avoid standing close to each other,
or being “down wind” of each other [77].

Filtration of outgoing air is not well tested for most kinds
of masks, but there is evidence of some protective value
[61, 34]. Droplets produced while breathing, talking and
coughing can be significantly reduced by mask usage
[73, 74, 75, 22], but much of the air expelled while coughing and sneezing goes around the mask [34].
Since effective filtration is difficult to achieve, both for
incoming and outgoing air, we assign no protective value
to the wearer for mask use, and assume no reduction in outgoing aerosols. These are conservative assumptions which
can be adjusted by reducing the infectious dose according
to any assumed protection factor. For example, a well fit
N95 respirator should reduce the infectious dose received
by the wearer by a factor of 20, and, in the absence of
an exhale valve, may reduce the quantity of low-velocity
outgoing aerosols by a similar factor.

UV-C Lighting

Illumination of the air-space in patient rooms with ultraviolet light has been shown to dramatically reduce viral
longevity in aerosol form, and thereby prevent infection
[19, 78, 79]. This could be used to decrease τa in spaces
where increasing air circulation (i.e., reducing τroom ) is
impractical. Clearly, this requires that air in the space
pass through the UV-C illuminated volume, and that it
received a long enough exposure to make inactivation ef6

fective. Care is also required to avoid exposing occupants
to UV-C radiation, which is required for viral deactivation
but can be harmful to the eyes and skin. This could be done
geometrically (e.g., only illuminate spaces above 2.5 m),
or actively with motion sensors.

infectivity decay time of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol form has
been found to be τdecay & 90 min [76, 84]. Note that we
are using the 1/e decay time, not the half-life, for ease of
computation.

The volume of saliva produced in a variety of activities is
used to understand the emission of virions into the environment (known as “viral shedding”). The values given
here are for “typical” individuals and behaviors, and actual
values for any given person or event may vary by an order
of magnitude [22, 50, 51, 80, 81, 24]. Droplets produced
while speaking, for instance, depend on speech loudness;
speaking loudly, yelling or singing can produce an order of
magnitude more saliva than speaking normally [25]. We
are careful to avoid quantifying saliva production in terms
of the number of droplets produced, since the large dropletnuclei are relatively small in number but carry most of the
virions (i.e., slope of the number distribution is too shallow
to compensate the fact that volume goes with diameter
cubed) [50, 82]. For a viral load of 1000 /nL, for example,
a 1 µm droplet nucleus has only a 1% probability of containing a single virion, while a 10 µm droplet nucleus is
likely to contain 5–15 virions [25].

Since the decay of the infectious aerosol concentration is
dominated by settling rather the infectivity decay of the
virions themselves, we use τa ∼ 20 min. The impact of
settling is non-negligible in poorly ventilated spaces, as
demonstrated by the outbreak described in appendix A.1.

The second timescale is set by the settling time of the larger
aerosol particles which contain the majority of the virions
shed into the environment. Using the “continuous fallout”

The rate of air exchange with the environment while breathing (“breathing rate” rb ) varies among individuals and
activities by a factor of a few, except in the case of strenuous exercise which can increase it by as much as a factor
of 5 [21]. As such, this is a relatively well determined
parameter and we use only the nominal value in our calculations. Our nominal value, rb = 10 L/min, corresponds
to a standing individual who is resting or engaged in light
exercise, such that their tidal volume is about 0.5 L, and
their breathing cycle has a 3 s period [52].
The respiratory infectivity, Ninf , is not well known for
SARS-CoV-2, but it has been measured for SARS [42],
other coronaviruses, and influenza [31, 48]. Variation
by an order of magnitude among individuals is observed
both for coronaviruses and influenza. The number we use,
Ninf = 1000, is intended to be “typical” for coronaviruses
[86] and represents roughly 100 “plaque forming units”
(PFU) as measure for SARS [42], each of which is roughly
10 virions [87].

The viral load in saliva, ρ, has been seen to vary by more
than 8 orders of magnitude in individuals that test positive for COVID-19 [37, 47]. Roughly 90% of individuals
tested have a viral load less than ρ0 = 1000 /nL, while
1% may have a viral load above 3 × 104 /nL [47]. Viral load is seen to decline after symptom onset, so the
pre-symptomatic viral load may be on the high-end of the
distribution [37, 49, 83]. We use ρ0 = 1000 /nL for our
nominal dose calculations because it results in a rough
estimate of the probability of infection relative to the full
distribution for probabilities of a few percent (i.e., the “random ρVsrc Ninf ” curve is close to the other curves around
Dinf ∼ 0.03 in Fig. 1, right). This choice does not impact
the final probability of infection shown in Fig. 1, since a
different choice of ρ0 would shift the “random ρVsrc Ninf ”
curve to compensate.

Transmission Probability

In this section we relate the infectious dose calculations
presented in section 4 to the probability of infection (for
a single individual) or transmission (to any member of a
group) while accounting for the probability distributions
of the parameters discussed in section 6 and appendix B.

Aerosol Decay Time

While the infectious dose for any set of parameters can
be estimated using the equations in section 4, estimating the probability of infection in a given situation requires marginalizing over the probability distribution function associated with each of the parameters. Fortunately,

Ventilation rates aside, there are two timescales relevant
to the decay of the infectious aerosol concentration: the
decline in potency or “infectivity“ of virions over time,
and the slow settling of droplet nuclei due to gravity. The

Outbreaks

Documented outbreaks offer a means for checking the plausibility of our aerosol transmission model. In this section we
select a few outbreaks where transmission via aerosols appears likely (e.g., distances were too large for droplets, or the
pattern of infection followed the airflow).
Information about the outbreaks is, however, limited, and the viral load of the contagious individual is not known, so
these comparisons only provide weak constraints on the model parameters. In particular, reported outbreaks are likely
to involve unusually contagious individuals (a.k.a. “super-spreaders”), with ρ0 & 1000 /nL (roughly 10% of cases), so
we use that value in these computations. Since this fixes the value of ρ, we use the “random Vsrc Ninf ” curve in Fig. 1 to
compute the probability of infection.
A.1

Guangzhou Restaurant

[88, 89] document a COVID-19 outbreak associated with air flow in a restaurant (Guangzhou, China). Unlike many
outbreaks, this one was studied in great detail, including on-site experimental recreation of the airflow and computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, making it an excellent cross-check for our simplified aerosol model [88].
In this outbreak, there was one contagious individual (CI) seated at a table with 9 family members. Air circulation in
the restaurant was dominated by wall mounted air conditioning units, one of which essentially defined a well mixed air
space that included 2 other families totaling 11 people. The distance between CI and the people infected varied from
∼ 50 cm to 4.6 m with 4 of the 5 people who were infected at other tables 2 or more meters from CI [88]. There is no
obvious correlation between who was infected and their distance from CI or the direction that CI was facing.
Of the people at the table with CI, 4 of 9 were infected, while 5 of the 11 people at the other 2 tables were infected
(45% attack rate in both cases). The aerosol concentration at these three tables was found to be quite similar, both
experimentally and in CFD models [88]. Given the common source (i.e., the contagious individual), we use the “random
Ninf ” curve in Fig. 1 (right, yellow) to estimate the infectious dose required to produce this attack rate as Dinf ' 0.6.
In the next paragraph we compare this value with the estimate we get from direct calculation using Eqn. 9.
The recirculating air space defined by the wall mounted AC unit which transported air from CI to other diners
who were infected is roughly 60 m3 and was found to have rroom ∼ 1 m3 /min, and roughly 1 air change per hour
(τroom ∼ 60 min). The overlap in time between CI and the other diners in this air space was approximately 60 minutes.
This is situation is not in the well ventilated limit, and has fa ∼ 1/4 according to Eqn. 7 with our estimated 20 minute
time-constant for settling (see section 6.2).
Assuming a somewhat talkative contagious individual (rsrc ∼ 4 nL/min), and given rroom ∼ 1 m3 /min and t ∼ 60 min,
0
the other diners were exposed to a nominal infectious dose of Dinf
∼ 0.6. This is a perfect match to the value computed
using the attack rate, and indicates that CI’s viral load was likely around ρ0 at the time of this outbreak. This is not
surprising since, as noted above, there is a selection bias when working with noteworthy outbreaks that precludes low
values of ρ.
The detailed analysis of this outbreak offers a number of other quantitative and qualitative tests of our simplified model
of aerosol infection. [88] notes that a table near the CI (“table 17”), but not in the air space defined by the AC unit, had
a relatively high aerosol concentration due to leakage from the primary air circulation pattern. There were 5 people at
this table, and they overlapped with CI for 18 minutes at the end of CI’s stay. It is unlikely that the infectious dose
summed over all 5 diners was larger than 1, since Pinf ' 0.7 for Dinf = 1, indicating an average Dinf . 0.2 with 70%
confidence (and average Dinf . 0.6 with 90% confidence). This is consistent with the shorter overlap time and the
somewhat reduced aerosol concentration at table 17.
However, a similar analysis applied to the 50 diners who were at more distant tables (e.g., “table 10” in [88]), none of
whom were infected, indicates a relatively short aerosol decay time. Since the total infectious dose required to cause at
least one infection does not depend on the number of people exposed (i.e., total Dinf . 1 with 70% confidence, and
Dinf . 3 with 90% confidence), the average infectious dose for these 50 diners must have been less than Dinf . 0.06
(90% confidence). Assuming an average overlap time with CI of at least 30 minutes, the virion aerosol concentration
must have been at least 5 times less than the concentration around the 3 tables where the attack rate was high. Using the
data in figure S4 of [88], we can see that this requires the aerosol concentration to come to steady-state much more
quickly than the tracer gas used in that study. Steady state was likely achieved in less than 10 minutes, and certainly in
less than 20 minutes. This agrees with the settling times of 5–10 µm droplet nuclei, as discussed in section 6.2.
Analysis of surveillance videos reveals no close contact, or objects shared, among members of different families. None
of the restaurant staff were infected, nor were patrons of other businesses in the building. Simply put, this outbreak
is essentially impossible to explain with surface contamination or large droplet driven transmission, and yet easily
understood in terms of aerosol transmission.

Hunan Coach

[90] documents an outbreak on a long distance coach (Hunan, China). This 45 person coach should have rroom '
8 m3 /min [11], and we will estimate the ride duration as 2 hours. The contagious individual did not interact with
0
others, so we assign a source rate of rsrc = rb = 1 nL/min. The resulting nominal dose of Dinf
∼ 0.15 is in reasonable
agreement with the fact that 8 of the 45 passengers were infected. The infections were somewhat localized, with the
most distant 4.5 meters from the contagious individual, possibly due to incomplete mixing of the air in the bus.
This outbreak also resulted in the infection of a passenger who boarded 30 minutes after the contagious passenger
disembarked. This could have been due to surface contamination, but then one must wonder why no passengers on later
voyages were infected (since fomites last for days) [76]. More likely it indicates settling and air exchange while the bus
was stopped resulted in an order of magnitude reduction in infectious dose. (Outbreaks on vehicles were common in
China, possibly due to poor ventilation [11].)
A.3

Seattle Choir

[91, 92] Of 60 singers 87% infected after singing together for 2.5 hours in a small church (Vroom ∼ 600 m3 ). An
air-cycle time of 30 minutes gives rroom ∼ 20 m3 /min, and singing can be approximated by rsrc ∼ 30 nL/min. The
150 minute exposure yields an infectious dose of Dinf ∼ 0.9 (accounting for settling with fa = 0.4). Sadly, this makes
the probability of infection quite high (Pinf ∼ 60%). Even more sadly, this is not the only choir outbreak [93, 94], and
this can happen even if distancing and hand-hygiene rules are strictly followed [95]. The least we can do is to learn from
their tragic experience. (Like choir practice, aerobic dance classes [96] and call centers [97] are ideal environments for
SARS-CoV-2 transmission.)
A.4

Diamond Princess

[98] concludes from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that long-range airborne transmission is unlikely
since SARS-CoV-2 did not pass through the ship’s air conditioning system. Two Okinawa taxi-drivers were, however,
infected by passengers during a shore visit. This outbreak is different from the others in that the contagious individual
who initiated the outbreak was not involved in the taxi-driver infections. At the time of the shore visit in Okinawa there
were roughly 25 pre-symptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess at least a few of whom disembarked.
If we assume that the taxi ride lasted 10 minutes (the port in Naha is close to the main attractions), that the contagious
passenger spent the ride talking to another passenger (or coughed once), and that the taxi had the fan on low (rroom ∼
1 m3 /min), the driver was exposed to an infectious dose of Dinf ∼ 1 according to Eqn. 9. Using the “random ρVsrc Ninf ”
curve in Fig. 1 since these were secondary infections, we find that the probability of transmission was about 15% for
each contagious passenger who disembarked. This probability is relatively insensitive to our assumptions and would
only change by a factor of 2 if the dose changed by an order of magnitude (in either direction). If both infections in
Naha were caused by the same contagious individual (one on the ride in, one on the ride out) it would be appropriate to
use the “random Vsrc Ninf ” probability of 60%.
Fortunately, there were no other COVID-19 infections linked to the Diamond Princess’ stop in Okinawa, indicating
that the closed environment and long exposure time of the taxi was likely a key ingredient for transmission. That is,
changing the air-flow rate in the above calculation to rroom & 100 m3 /min to represent shops and more open spaces
would reduce the probability of infection to less than 2%. And, while surface transmission could explain transmission to
taxi drivers, it does not explain the absence of transmission to shop keepers or other people with whom the passengers
of the Diamond Princess interacted.
A.5

Hospital Air Sampling

There was no outbreak in the Nebraska Medical Center, but air sampling in and around COVID-19 patient rooms
[99] offers a further cross-check of the calculations presented here. Approximately 3 viral RNA copies per liter of
air sampled were found in a patient’s room (and in the hallway outside the patient’s room after the door was opened).
These rooms have τroom ' 8 min and Vroom ' 30 m3 , indicating an airflow rate of rroom ∼ 4 m3 /min [56]. Equation
5 indicates a steady-state concentration of ρSS
A ' 0.25 /L. This suggests that either this patient had a very high viral
load (ρ ∼ 1010 /mL, which is in the top 3%), or that they were occasionally talking or coughing and had ρ ∼ ρ0 .
Air sampling data is also available from hospitals and public areas in China. [100] reports quantitative viral deposition
rate of roughly 2 /m2 per minute in a patient’s room. The area sampled was 3 m from the patient’s bed, so too far for
most droplets [14]. If we assume that this is due to slow settling of the larger droplet-nuclei with characteristic a speed
of usettle ∼ 0.1 m/min (see section 6.2), this implies a aerosol concentration of roughly 20 /m3 . (Oddly, air samplers
10

A EROSOL G UIDELINES - J UNE 8, 2020

in patient rooms did not detect concentrations above their detection threshold, but the patient’s bathroom and other
areas in the hospital had concentrations near 20 /m3 ).
A concentration of 20 /m3 is more than a factor of 100 lower than that reported in Nebraska [99], but still implies ρ above
the median of the distribution function shown in Fig. 2. If we assume an air flow rate in the room of rroom ∼ 4 m3 /min
and viral shedding dominated by breathing (i.e., Vsrc ∼ Vb ), for instance, ρ is roughly 108 /mL = ρ0 /10.

B

Parameter Probability Distributions

As described in section 6 several parameters used in this work vary significantly between individuals and events. This
appendix describe the details of the probability density functions use for ρ, Vsrc and Ninf .
Figure 2 shows the distribution for ρ. The estimated distribution used in this work is derived from [47] with the low
end of the distribution pushed up somewhat to account for the downward trend in viral load after symptom onset. The
log-normal distribution centered at 106 /mL with σ = 102 is estimated from the linear fit in figure 2 of [49]. These
distributions both have a median viral load of 106 /mL and roughly 10% of cases above 109 /mL. We have computed
Pinf as in Fig. 1 for both distributions and they give quantitatively similar, and qualitatively identical, results.
To account for individual variability, we use a log-normal distribution for Ninf which is centered around 1000 and has a
width of a factor of 2. This makes the 95% confidence interval 250–4000 which is in reasonable agreement with [42]
and [31].
Similarly, an order of magnitude variation among individuals and events is also expected in droplet and aerosol
production [80, 25]. For this we also use a log-normal distribution centered around the Vsrc values given in Table 1 with
a width of a factor of 3.
