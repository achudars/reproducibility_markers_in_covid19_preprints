Abstract
We propose a mathematical model to analyze the time evolution of the total number of infected
population with Covid-19 disease at a region in the ongoing pandemic. Using the available data
of Covid-19 infected population on various countries we formulate a model which can successfully
track the time evolution from early days to the saturation period in a given wave of this infectious
disease. It involves a set of effective parameters which can be extracted from the available data.
Using those parameters the future trajectories of the disease spread can also be projected. A set of
differential equations is also proposed whose solutions are these time evolution trajectories. Using
such a formalism we project the future time evolution trajectories of infection spread for a number
of countries where the Covid-19 infection is still rapidly rising.

INTRODUCTION

Currently a pandemic is ongoing throughout the world caused by a contagious respiratory
disease, called Covid-19. The pathogen of this respiratory disease is a novel coronavirus,
named SARS-CoV-2 [1]. It started from China and subsequently spreads to most of the
countries, and as of August 12, 2020, it has infected more than 20.2 million human population
worldwide causing more than 740 thousand deaths [1–3]. Though the spread of infection
has substantially reduced in several countries, particularly in China and Europe, in many
countries with a large population, such as USA, Brazil and India, the pandemic is surging
prominently at this time. It is also not clear whether this respiratory disease will be seasonal
and a second wave will come later. There is no clear consensus in the scientific community
on the possible future evolution of this disease and naturally there is no consensus on the
ideal intervention strategy by a government in minimizing the number of fatalities while
allowing economic and social activities. Many mathematical models have been put forward
[4–32] 1 to track the time evolution of the disease spread, to understand its dynamics, as well
as to provide a feasible guidance to governments around the world to control this pandemic.
As in ecology and population growth, in epidemiology too the time evolution of virus
growth in a population is of fundamental importance. In general, one builds a model of
disease transmission using a system of differential equations with an assumption of initial
exponential growth [35–45]. A standard way for mathematical analysis of the dynamics of
infection spread is to adopt a variety of compartmental models originated primarily from the
so-called SIR model [46–48], incorporating susceptible (S), infectious (I) and Recovered (R)
population. For the Covid-19 disease growth, one of these models, the so-called SEIR model,
and its extensions have been utilized extensively [5–23, 31]. In this scheme of models, one
divides the total population, N , at a infected region (e.g., city, country), into susceptible (S),
exposed (E), Infected (I) and Recovered (R) population with a constraint S +E +I +R = N .
A set of differential equations incorporating these correlated compartments then provides
the time evolution of disease spread. The success and problem of this model have been
discussed over last few months in detail and there is no clear consensus whether this type
of models can predict the spread of Covid-19 with reasonable accuracy [33, 34]. There is

an alternate view that the integral equations based models could be more effective than
the models based on differential equations mentioned above to describe the dynamics of
epidemics [30, 49, 50].
Another approach in studying the dynamics of an epidemic is to employ data-driven
phenomenological statistical models [24–29] where one constructs a mathematical description
utilizing the existing data on the epidemics. For example, the numbers of total infections,
day to day infections, fatalities etc. can be utilized to construct a model with a number of
parameters and then constrain those parameters with the data. Of course, these models do
not include any microscopic parameters but can describe the data in an effective way. Once
the model parameters are fixed, in principle, it is possible to project2 the future dynamics
of the infection spread.
In this work, adopting the phenomenological approach of the statistical models, we propose a mathematical model for the time evolution of the number of infected population.
Rather than proposing a microscopic model, by analyzing the available data on various
countries and cities, we develop an effective time evolution trajectory on the number of total
infection which can be employed at Covid-19-affected regions. The reason behind adopting
such an approach is that since the Covid-19 disease is contagious, assuming a region as a
closed system, the number of today’s infected population is directly correlated to the number of infected population in the past, and moreover, today’s number will also determine
how many people will be infected in the near future. The parameters of the model can be
thought of as an effective mean-field type parameters, which can be constrained with the
available data, and later those can be employed for the future time evolution of the disease spread. We find that there is a clear common pattern in the initial growth, mitigation
and saturation periods of the time evolution of the number of infected population at various Covid-19-affected regions. The only difference in describing the Covid-19 virus spread
between various affected population is the difference between parameter sets of these regions. However, they are all confined within a smaller subspace of the parameter space. The
differences between parameters of different regions are possibly due to their differences in
total number of population, density, mobility, age and gender distributions, testing facility,
lockdown effect, social distancing etc. microscopic factors. Of course, it will be interest2

ing to find mathematical correlations between the effective parameters and the microscopic
parameters.
Using the proposed model, we also formulate a set of differential equations which can
equally well describe the Covid-19 spread at an affected population from the initial days to
the saturation period. The time evolution of these differential equations can be performed
with any good first-order differential equation solver with matching the boundary conditions
at different periods of infection. We find that by solving these differential equations it is
possible to find a common trajectory that can describe the available data on the total
number of infected population for all periods of Covid-19 spread. The parameters inside
these differential equations can be tuned with the available data. Instead of finding a single
trajectory, we use the available data set with error-bars which yield a set of parameters and
hence a set of trajectories within the allowed errorbars. The use of errorbars on the available
data is justified as the exact number of infection is unknown due to the lack of adequate
testing facility and often for social as well as political reasons. We use a larger error (mostly
within 10%, and in a few cases maximum up to 20%) at the first 14 days (considering the
incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 virus) and later reduced it to less than a percent level
in the saturation period. This is a reasonable assumption, as in the initial days the testing
facilities are in general severely inadequate, the symptoms are not well recognized in the
population and hence under-reported and so the reported infected numbers could be well
below the true numbers. In the later days, these bottlenecks in general reduce substantially
and the number of reported cases become less erroneous. We adopt a χ2 minimization
procedure to incorporate these errors and this also helps to get a band of trajectories around
its mean values (reported numbers). In this way, the onset of saturation period of infection
can also be span over a few days (or weeks), and not on a single day which is also what we
observe at various affected regions.
In this work, our main objective is to build a model, utilizing the available data on
Covid-19 spread of various regions, which can track the time evolution of the number of
infected population, and also to project the possible future trajectory. As it is data-driven,
the dynamics of our model and its predictive power is dependent on the correct source of
data, and hence the model parameters and projection can change if the data is erroneous.
We use data mainly from the coronavirus resources of Wikipedia [3], W.H.O. [1] as well
as of local governments. We assume each region as a closed system and all conditions
4

during the disease spread more or less remain to be the same so that a time correlation
of infection can be built. If the prevailing measures against the disease spread, such as
effectiveness of lockdown, social distancing, contact tracing and quarantine, preventive maskwearing, forbidding large public gatherings etc., under which the data were available, change
substantially then the parameters and hence the trajectories will also change. However, this
model can be progressively improved with more data, and projection for a few weeks to a
month or more can also be made.
We organize the article as below. In section II, we detail our model and also elaborate
on the set of differential equations corresponding to this model. In section III, we provide
results with numerical details. First, we validate the model by analyzing data on various
European countries and New York City. Then to demonstrate the predictive ability of this
model we show how a subset of data can help to predict the future time evolution trajectory
of the infection at a region. Next, we proceed to analyze data on Russia, Brazil, India
and the USA where Covid-19 infections are still increasing rapidly. For India we separately
analyze the data for its two biggest cities: Mumbai and Delhi. For each of the regions,
within this model, we show the projections of the future time evolution of the infection with
the most probable time-scale for the onset of saturation along with the cumulative number
of infection. At the end, we discuss our results and conclude.

A DYNAMICAL MODEL FOR COVID-19 SPREAD

The basis of building a phenomenological data-driven model is to analyze the available
data on the targeted problem and formulate a mathematical framework to represent the
data, with a minimal set of parameters, in a consistent plausible way. This mathematical
model can also predict (project) the dynamics in a domain where data is not available.
With this in mind we analyze the number of cumulative infected population of Covid-19
disease for a number of countries and cities. In Fig. 1 we represent the available data in a
few possible ways. In the top plots we show the cumulative number of infected populations
(N (t)) as a function of time (Days(t)), in linear and log scales respectively. The bottom
left plot shows the same data when we normalize the infected population of a region by its
total population, whereas the bottom right plot shows the number of infection per day as a
function of day (log-scale is used to show all data in one plot so that they can be compared

together).

FIG. 1: The time-evolution trajectories of Covid-19-infected population for various countries and
cities are shown. The top left plot shows the cumulative number of infected population (N (t)) in
linear-scale while the top left one represents the same in log-scale. The bottom left plot represents
data normalized by the total population (Np ) of the affected regions. The bottom right plot
shows the number of infected population per day. Data (till July 31,2020) are obtained from Refs.
[1, 3, 56–69].

By observing the progress of Covid-19 disease spread at various countries, as shown in
Fig. 1, we find that the time evolution of cumulative infected population shows more or less
a common pattern, irrespective of the inherent different conditions prevailing at the affected
regions. We find that the total infection time can be divided broadly within the following
three periods:
• an early increment period (t0 ≤ t ≤ tm )
• a mitigation period (tm < t < tsi )
6

• a decline or saturation period (tsi ≤ t ≤ tsf ).
Here t0 , tm , tsi and tsf are the starting times of infection, mitigation, saturation and the
ending time of the infection, respectively. Of course, the transitions from one period to the
other are not sharps, rather those are cross-over between two regions and can span over a
couple of days or weeks. For example, for the latent factor, t0 may not be a particular day.
Similarly tm , tsi , tsf may also span over a couple of days or weeks. Hence, if there are different
mathematical forms for describing the time evolution at different periods, there should be
a continuity of the functional forms from one period to the others as will be explained
later. The transition times from one period to other can be determined through the data,
for example, by minimizing the χ2 of a particular model against the data. Naturally, the
transition times will be different for different countries since the conditions responsible for
early infection rate, decrement of that rate in the mitigation period, onset of the saturation
period are different for different countries.
To show the above findings more conclusively, as a representative case, in Fig. 2, we show
the time evolution trajectory of the infected population of England with top plot showing
the cumulative infected population and the bottom plot representing the per day increment
of infection as a function of days. The above-mentioned three periods are differentiated with
different colors mentioning the transition times. These transition times are calculated by
fitting our model with available data with a minimum acceptable χ2 which we will discuss
later in detail. For England, with fixing the initial days of infection (t0 ) as February 24,
2020, we find that the transition time from early rise to the mitigation period started at
around t = 47, and the onset of saturation period started at around t = 93 days. We will
discuss on this in more detail in section II when all other results will be presented.
By analyzing the available data for various countries, we find empirically that a possible
way to track the trajectory of the number of infected population, within the above-mentioned
three periods, starting from the early days (t0 ) to the saturation period (tsf ), is through the
following equations:



e
fi (t) = Aeαi (t−t0 ) t0 ≤ t ≤ te + [B + Ctαi ]te < t ≤ tm ,

(2)

and in some cases, simply be the following power-rise form
fi (t) = [B + Ctαi ]t0 ≤ t ≤ tm .

(3)

Here A, B, C are constants and mainly depend on the latent population and the density of
population, while αie and αi govern the rate of infection in a given population. In reality,
αie and αi are time-dependent variables and depend on many factors, such as the density of
8

population, the total population, effectiveness of the preventive measures against the disease
spread. In this study we assume that these variables can be taken as constants in the sense
of an effective mean-field approximation: αie (t) = α˜ie and αi (t) = α̃i . However, if there are
rapid mutations of the pathogen, migration between different population in a short interval
as well as rapid change in environmental factors, these assumptions may not be valid. For
a given population, depending on its density, immunity in population, social distancing or
any other preventing factor against the disease spread, one of the above forms enhances the
infection to a large number in a short period of time. By tracking the infected population
in the early rise period one can fix one of these forms to explain the rise of infected of
population. Such power-law-rise form was also observed in Refs. [24].
In the second period (so-called mitigation period with tm ≤ t < tsi ), we find that the
time evolution trajectory for the total number of infected population can be tracked with a
combination of rising and damping factors through the following equation:

γ
fm (t) = Dtαm e−λ(t−tm ) tm < t < ts

(4)
i

where, αm is related to the rate of infection in this period, while the parameters λ and γ
determine how fast the saturation period can be reached. The decrease of early infection
rate may happen for various reasons, for example for government imposed preventive measures, development of immunity in the community, availability of drugs etc. Eventually the
infection rate saturates and then decreases depending on the effectiveness of these external
factors.
For a given wave of infection, we observe that the increment of infection in the saturation/decline period (tsi ≤ t ≤ tsf ) can be tracked through the following equation:


fs (t) = N (tsi ) + E 1 − e−αs (t−tsi ) ,

(5)

where E is a constant, αs is the infection rate in this period, and these constants depend
on the population density, herd immunity factor, availability of remedy through drugs etc.
However, in this period, at any time, a second wave may start if there is a large unaffected
population and the restrictions to contain the virus become much softer. If the virus is
seasonal, on which there is no consensus yet, it can also come back to unaffected population.
In the case of USA, such a second rise of infection by this virus is quite prominent (and
probably also for Spain, albeit slowly) which we will discuss later.
9

To be noted that rather than using a single mathematical formula for tracking the infection throughout the contamination period, from the early rise to the saturation period,
as used in [24, 28, 29], we use three different functional forms. The reason behind such
a formulation is that the dynamics of disease spread in three periods are different due to
change in various external conditions as infection progresses (this is quite apparent in Fig.
2). A single functional form, as used in Refs. [24, 28, 29] is thus not suitable to follow the
time evolution dynamics throughout the contamination period. As mentioned earlier, in our
case, at the boundaries the model-evaluated trajectories obtained from different functional
forms are matched between two periods so that no discontinuity arises.
Though these data-driven mathematical trajectories can be effective to project the future
evolution of the disease, it is important to find out a set of differential equations whose
solution are these equations. That may help to understand the dynamics of infection in a
better way as well as the origin of such equations and their parameters. To achieve such a
formulation it is worthwhile to look towards the growth equations in ecology and epidemic
studies. In fact in epidemic studies, to estimate the infection rate, cumulative number of
cases, the peak number of infected population, future dynamics of the epidemics etc., one
can use the growth equations. One such approach is the standard logistic model [52] where
population growth is determined through an exponential growth, constrained to the number
of population, as below:


N (t)
dN
= αN (t) 1 −
,
dt
K

(6)

where the first term αN (α > 0) implies an initial exponential growth with an exponent α,
while the second term, known as the bottleneck factor with the parameter K, the carrying
capacity, adjusts the growth with critical resources in the population. A situation with
maturity of population arrives as the competition between two terms reduces the combined
growth rate, until the infected population saturates. Since the environmental conditions
influence the carrying capacity (K), as a consequence it can be time-varying (K(t) > 0),
leading to the following mathematical model of growth:


dN
N (t)
= αN (t) 1 −
.
dt
K(t)

(7)

This can be associated with a more general growth model, the so-called generalized Richards
Model [53] which was originally introduced in the context of ecological population growth,

10

as below:



ν 
dN
N (t)

(8)

where the additional parameter ν > 0 determines the asymptote of maximum growth. This
model has a solution (when K is independent of time)
N (t) =

K
1/ν

(1 + νe−αν(t−ttp ) )

(9)

with ttp as the turning point where the growth rate becomes maximum. This model has
already been employed for real-time prediction in epidemiology, for example in Refs. [54, 55].
At this point, we would like to correlate our observed empirical growth model (Eq.(1)),
with Richards Model (Eq.(8)). However, once a government introduces a measure, such
as lockdown and/or introduction of preventive drugs, to reduce the disease spread, the
mitigation period also reduces. If one considers a time-dependent log-kill factor, c(t)N (t),
as in reference [24], the above equation modifies to

(10)

If Eq.(1b) is a theoretical model for infectious growth with preventive measures against
infection spread, and Eq.(10) can also explain the same growth, then Eq.(1b) could well be
a solution of Eq.(10). Following the similar strategy as in Ref. [24], we find that for t > t0 ,
Eq.(1b) is a solution for Eq.(10) with the following set of parameters:

α = γ(γ − 1)λtm ; K(t) =

With this parameterization, we arrive at the following dynamical evolution equation of the
infection growth for Covid-19 with preventive measures (such as lockdown, social distancing,
introduction of preventive drugs etc.)

The above equation has five parameters: α, αm , β, λ and γ, and those are dependent on the
particular virus that is spreading, the infection rate in a particular community as well as on
11

the externally imposed conditions such as the lockdown measures to which the population
is subjected to (tm will be determined by varying it dynamically and requiring minimum
χ2 ). With the available data these parameters can be constrained and then Eq. (12) can be
utilized for future time evolution. To be noted that with αm = 1, and γ = 2, Eq.(1b) turns
to Covid-19 model of Ref. [24], which can be thought of as a special case of Eq.(1b).
Combining all the terms, the final compilation of a set of equations that we propose for
the time evolution of the cumulative infected population at different period is the following:

These equations can be solved numerically for a given set of parameters, and by matching
the boundary conditions at tm and tsi one can get a time evolution trajectory for the whole
infection period. The parameters of Eq.(13) can be fixed through a χ2 -fitting of the numerical
trajectory against the available data. The transition periods can be evaluated dynamically
by requiring the minimum χ2 . Here one can introduce an error σi ’s on each days data which
will then generate a set of trajectories allowed within that errors.
The onset of saturation (plateauing), that is tsi , can be determined by finding the maximum of N (t) at the end of the mitigation period. Taking the first derivative one arrives
at
λγ(t − tm )γ−1 − n = 0,

(14)

a positive-time solution of which provides tsi . One can also find the inflection point, that is
the onset of approach towards tsi , by taking the second derivative which yields
λγt2 [1 + γ{λ(t − tm )γ − 1}](t − tm )m−2 − n[1 + 2λγt(t − tm )m−1 ] + n2 = 0,
and then finding a solution of this equation.

(15)

We use both Eqs. (1) and (13) to generate the time evolution trajectories and the
parameters are fixed using the available data. The full trajectories, covering the whole
contamination period, are then generated which also project the disease spread at the future
times. Results obtained for various affected regions are presented in the next section.

RESULTS

In this section we present the results obtained through our proposed model. First, we
will check whether the proposed model is able to successfully track the available data on the
cumulative number of infection at various Covid-19-affected regions. Then we will probe the
predictive ability of our model using a subset of data and reproducing the later trajectory.
Finally, we will project the future time evolution of the number of infected population for a
few countries where the infection is still rising rapidly.
To validate our model we use the available data on Covid-19-infected population of the
following countries: England, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and also for New York City.
These data are taken from Refs. [56–61]. We choose these countries and city as they have
already at the inside of the saturation period (after tsi ) in the ongoing wave of Covid-19
disease. This will enable us to test our model from the early rise to the saturation period.
After demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed model we proceed to show the predictive
ability of our model by analyzing the subset of data for Italy and New York City. As will be
evident later that this model can predict the future time evolution trajectory for a few weeks
to months. Then we will show our results on the total number of infected population of USA,
Brazil, Russia and India (separately on Mumbai and Delhi also), where the number of cases
are still rapidly increasing. This will enable us to project the time evolution trajectories
of these countries in the mitigation period, till they reach the beginning of their respective
plateau positions (starting at tsi ).

A.

Validation of the proposed model

As mentioned earlier, to validate our proposed model, as in Eqs. (1) and (13), we first
analyze the time evolution of the number of Covid-19 positive population for a number of
countries for which the mitigation periods ended and the saturation periods have started. For

13

a given country, using the available data on the cumulative number of infected population,
obtained from Refs. [1, 3, 56–69], we perform a non-linear χ2 -fitting of Eq. (1) (details
of data analysis is given in the Appendix). The data are fitted over the entire time range
simultaneously with three sub-equations in Eq. (1). We vary the extent of different timeperiods dynamically and choose tm and tsi that minimize the total χ2 , which is a sum over
individual terms, i.e., χ2 = χ2i + χ2m + χ2s . Here the definition of χ2 is the usual one χ2 =
P
2
(f (ti ) − N (ti ))2 /σN
(ti ) , where f (ti ) is Eq. (1), N (ti ) is the cumulative number of infected
population on i-th day, and σN (ti ) is the error on that. We introduce this error (σN (ti ) ) with
each day’s number with a maximum of 20% error for the first 14 days (incubation period,
and most cases it is 10%) and less than a percent level error as the fit approaches to the
saturation period. An error of about 5-1% is imposed in between with gradual decrement
with the number of days. We have already mentioned it and elaborating it further here
with following arguments: at the onset of infection, the number of initial cases is not well
determined as the number of tests performed could well be too low and there is a good
probability for underestimation. We keep the maximum error for the first 14 days which is
typically the incubation period for this respiratory disease. The testing procedure, capacity
as well as reliability improves over time and hence the reported number for the Covidpositive cases becomes less more erroneous over time. The timing of a transition from one
period to other, as mentioned at the beginning of section II is chosen dynamically so that
the total χ2 is minimum. To avoid a sharp transition between two periods (for example,
early rise to mitigation, that is points just before and after tm ) we interpolate the results
between the adjacent points obtained from two different fitting forms. This is justifiable as
we mentioned earlier that change form one period to others does not happen in a single day
and can happen with a smooth cross-over over several days. With this procedure we fit the
data for the above-mentioned countries uniformly. We first show our results for the first
two time-periods (initial and mitigation, till the onset of saturation) with fit to Eqs. (1a)
and (1b). This will show the validity of our model at these two time-periods. Later we also
show our results of the entire time-periods (initial mitigation, and saturation). We show
it separately as Eq.(1c) is the ideal representation of the saturation period with the same
environmental factors as in the mitigation period. However, in this period due to possible
ease of various environmental factors and with a large unaffected population a second wave
of infection may resurface which needs to be dealt separately. That we will discuss for the
14

case of USA later.
In Fig. 3 we show the cumulative Covid-positive cases for the above-mentioned countries
for the first two time periods (initial to the onset of saturation, before tsi ), as determined
by our fit to Eqs. (1a) and (1b) dynamically with a minimum χ2 = χ2i + χ2m . The red
points are the actual data points as obtained from Refs. [56–61], while the black lines are
the fitted trajectories with the time evolution form as in Eqs. (1a) and (1b). In Table
I we show the mean values of the fitted parameters. As one can observe that the fitted
trajectories obtained through Eqs. (1a) and (1b) describe the actual trajectories of the time
evolution, quite well, starting from the onset of disease to the onset of saturation period as it
approaches the plateau region. It is interesting to see that the onset of saturation period for
all countries happened when the power γ reaches a value closer to 1. In Fig. 4, we show the
per day infection as a function of days for the above-mentioned countries. The red points
are the actual data points as obtained from Refs. [56–61], while the black lines are results
from Eq. (1).

It is evident from Figs. 3 and 4 that the Eqs. (1a) and (1b) are able to track the time
evolution of the cumulative infected population very well, from the beginning to the onset
of saturation period. One would expect that Eq. (1b) terminates at a point where the rate
of growth vanishes. However, that point is never reached due to multiple reasons: partial or
full un-lockdown when the rate of growth reduces, huge carrying capacity (when the total
number to reach herd immunity is very high). From the onset of saturation, thus Eq. (1b)

evolution with Eq. (1c) becomes effective. We choose the onset of tsi dynamically with the
condition such that χ2 = χ2i + χ2m + χ2s together provide the best acceptable χ2 /dgf with tsi
as high as possible. With that method we fit the available full data set till July 31, 2020.

FIG. 6: The number of infected population per day are shown for various countries and for New

the black solid lines are obtained using Eq. (1), as in Fig. 5.

Results for the total number of Covid-19 positive cases, (N (t)), and the per day increments
(dN (t)/dt), for the full data set along with fitted trajectories are shown in Figs. 5 and
6, respectively, for various countries and New York City. It is quite satisfying to see that
the full data set for various countries and cities as well can be tracked very well through

19

the model proposed in Eq. (1). It is to be mentioned here that in the saturation period
our main purpose is to show the validity of the proposed model. We do not project the
time evolution trajectory in the future in this period as is shown in the figure. Though the
extended trajectories (beyond data point) are obtained with 95% confidence intervals of the
fitted parameters, a projection in this period may not hold as a second wave of infection
can start at any point of time in this period. That is probably what is currently happening,
albeit with less extent, in all the regions mentioned in this plot, except for Italy and New
York city. Most notable one is on Spain’s data where from the middle of July, the number
for per day infection has started to increase again beyond what we observe throughout inside
a large part of saturation period (t = 81 − 135). Considering that Covid-19 is a contagious
disease, this second rise could be due to i) relaxation of measures against the disease spread
which was implemented earlier, ii) a large unaffected population, and iii) no availability of
an effective vaccine. This will be elaborated further when later we discuss the infection of
the USA.
Since data for an individual day fluctuates more and sometime extra data for a day gets
reported on the next day (since the official announcement comes at a certain time) it may be
worthwhile to study the same data taking an average over a few days. That will also check
the consistency of fits to extract the parameters of Eq. (1). We perform a study on that for
England’s data taking an average over 5 days (one can also choose a different bin size, but it
should not be too large). We fit the data with the same errorbar as in each day’s data with
the corresponding periods. The results are shown in Fig. 7, both corresponding to per day
data and average over 5 days. As one can see that there is no significant difference between
results obtained when we use each days data (magenta line) and average data (blue line).
Next, we proceed to solve Eq. (13) to find the time evolution trajectory governed by the
dynamics of such differential equations. Eqs. (13a), (13b) and (13c) are first-order differential equations with a number of parameters. These equations can be solved numerically with
a given set of parameters leading to a time-evolution trajectory of the total infected population. We vary the parameter set over a wide range and choose a parameter space which
can describe the time-dependent data with minimum χ2 with a given errorbar. Here, again
P
2
we take the usual definition of χ2 =
(f (ti ) − N (ti ))2 /σN
(ti ) , where f (ti )’s are obtained
from the solution of Eq. (13) after matching the boundary conditions, whereas N (ti )’s are
the actual data with imposed errors σi , which accounts for the uncertainty in the reported

numbers as mentioned earlier. To be noted that solutions of these equations with a given
errorbar will result in a band of trajectories rather than just one. However, that is more
realistic since a different set of parameters, with minimum χ2 , generates a band of trajectories which can spread over a few days which is also what we observe in reality. At the
boundary, we match the solution without any discontinuity that is solutions are continuously
progressed. For example, the initial value of N (t) at t = tm + 1 with (13b) is generated from
the solution of (13a) at t = tm . In this way, we match the boundary conditions of solutions
between different regions. A trajectory generated by these equations is accepted or rejected
based on the minimum χ2 within the errorbars. The trajectories obtained through these
differential equations for Italy and New York City are shown in Fig 8. Top two plots show
the time evolution trajectory for the cumulative number of infection while the bottom two
plots show its rate of change (infected number per day). Here again, it is satisfying to see
that the differential equations (13a) and (13b) can reproduce the time evolution of disease
spread from the initial days to the onset of saturation. Similarly, the solutions of Eq. (13c)
can also track the disease spread in the saturation period assuming the same environmental
condition prevails throughout this period. Though we show results for only two regions, data
for others regions can also be tracked with equal success through the proposed differential
equations (Eq. (13)).

Predictive ability of the proposed model

The success of a mathematical model not only depends on the validation but crucially
also on its predictive power. After successfully validating the model through reproducing
the time evolution of the number of infections, hence, we proceed to find the predictive
ability of our proposed model. Since the model is non-linear, a small change in parameter
space may result in a different time evolution trajectory. However, if there is a parameter
space that is unique to disease spread and if that can be constrained with a subset of data
then the model can be used for future evolution. With this in mind, we find that it is not
possible to constrain the parameter space until it reaches the beginning of the mitigation

22

period (t > tm ). That is apparent as the parameters of a region cannot be obtained from
other regions since the dynamics of disease spread in two regions are different. We use
a subset of data till the 55th days (for NYC) and 60th days (for Italy) and use those to
constrain the respective parameter spaces. We then employ those to obtain the respective
future trajectories till the onset of saturation period for the total number of infection. To be
mentioned that the onset of saturation period is determined dynamically by minimizing the
total χ2 . Results are shown in Fig. 9, where the top two plots are for the cumulative number
of infection and the bottom plots are for per day infection. The solid red lines represent the
actual data [59, 61] while the blue solid lines are obtained using differential equations (Eq.
(13)). To compare the effectiveness of projection from the model results, in the bottom two
figures we also plot the actual data for the whole range along with its fitted results through
Eq. (1). As can be observed from this figure that the proposed differential equations (Eq.
(13)) can project the future time evolution trajectories of the number of infection with a
correct trend for next few weeks quite reliably. For New York City the projection is for
21 days tsi (= 76 − 55) and the trend of the projected trajectory goes even beyond that.
For Italy this projection is for 25 days tsi (= 85 − 60). We find that this projection can
progressively be improved by gradually including more data. It would be interesting to see
how far in future time-scale this model can make a projection, and that we will discuss in
the next subsection while considering the disease spread for countries where the infection is
still increasing substantially.

C.

Projection for a few other countries

Having validated the model and then showing its predictive ability, we proceed to study
the data on other countries, Russia, Brazil, India and the USA, where the number of Covidpositive cases are still rising substantially. For India, we also choose two of its biggest
cities, Mumbai and Delhi. We first constrain the parameters by fitting the available data as
detailed above, both for Eq. (1) and the differential equations (Eq (13)). We then proceed
to predict the future time-evolution trajectories up to the onset of saturation.

Russia

In Fig. 10 we plot the cumulative number of Covid-19 positive cases for Russia [62] with
the effective starting date (t0 ) as March 03, 2020. The data of the time-trajectory shows the
expected exponential rise followed by a power-rise growth as in Eq. (1a) and (1b). We fit
the data with the combined equations and find αie = 0.2239 and αi = 4.886. It is interesting
to note that this is towards the higher value of αi that shown in Table 1 for other countries
in Europe. From the fitted results we find the transition from the rising to the mitigation
period has happened around time tm = 67, which corresponds to around May 10, 2020.
It is interesting to note that the mitigation period of Russia is quite longer compared to

24

other European countries, perhaps due to larger population. Using the available data up to
August 10 we extract the parameters and use those to predict the time evolution trajectory
till the time t = 200 − 215, which we believe, signals the onset of saturation period (tsi )
with less than 300 per day infections. We also use the proposed differential equation for the
time evolution (Eq (13)) and constrain the parameter set using data till August 10. The
corresponding time evolution trajectories (both cumulative and differential) are shown in
Fig. 10. The blue bands are obtained using the constrained parameter set, while the red
solid lines are actual data. The projected results, using both Eq. (1) as well as Eq. (13) show
that, with the same prevailing environmental condition as it is now, the onset of saturation
(tsi ) will start most probably in between t = 190 − 215. That is, by the late September to
the middle of October the number of infection will reduce substantially (below 300 per days)
with a total cumulative infected number in between 0.95-1.1 million. With the sustained
conditions against disease spread a gradual slow increment is thereafter expected. It will be
interesting to find if the true data follows the trajectory as we projected in Fig. 10.

Brazil

The second country whose data we study, and where Covid-19 infection is increasing
rapidly, is Brazil. It has a large population and high population density in a number of big
25

cities. It is natural to expect that without the strict regulations on human to human contact
and proper mechanisms to tackle a pandemic, a contagious disease like Covid-19 will spread
rapidly to a high number, and both the rising as well as mitigation periods will be prolonged.
In fact, in a short span of time the total number of infection has reached to a large number
and it is now the second most affected country with total infections more than 3 million and
more than one hundred thousand deaths (Ref. [63] till August 10). The infection is still
very much increasing and one would expect that a large population will further be infected
in the foreseeable future. It is thus quite important to project the probable time evolution
of the total number of infection.

The total number of Covid-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected population (left) and the

per day infection (right) are shown as a function of time (days) for Brazil. The red filled circles are
actual data from Ref. [63]. Data up to August 10 are used to obtain parameters for Eqs. (1) and
(13), and projections for future evolution are shown by black and blue lines with allowed values in
the parameter space.

We analyze Brazil’s data on the total number of infection till August 10. As in other
countries, we find an exponential (αie = 0.3) followed by a power-law-rise (αi = 3.926)
increment at the beginning. With further analysis our finding is that Brazil is now at the
early stage of mitigation at its first wave of infection. The mitigation period has possibly
started around day 91 (around the beginning of June) assuming t0 of infection as March
05, 2020. Using the available data till August 10 [63], we first constrain the parameters
of Eqs. (1) and Eq. (13). With the constrained set of parameters, the projection for
future trajectories of the total number of infection, till the possible time for the onset of
26

saturation, are shown in Fig. 11. The red solid line is the available data, black solid lines
are obtained through Eq. (1) and the blue band represents the projection through the
differential equations in Eq (13). Our results suggest that the current wave of infection,
with the prevailing measures against disease spread, will progress for another 3-4 months
and then it will reach to the beginning of the saturation period by the end of November
with less than 2500 infections per day. The cumulative number of infection by then will
reach to 5.5-6.5 million. However, with more stringent measures to prevent disease spread
or if an effective vaccine becomes available soon, the mitigation period could be shortened.
On the other hand, if the prevailing conditions of preventive measures become softer and
no vaccine is available, then a second wave can start from this mitigation period with more
number of infections as is happening now in USA. There is still a large uncertainty in this
projection. As mentioned earlier that this projection can be progressively improved with
inclusion of more data as the disease progress further. Update results will be posted in the
url mentioned later 4 .

India

The analysis of Covid-19 data on India provides an ideal platform as well as a challenge to
formulate a model for the time evolution trajectory of the infected population considering
the shear numbers for both the population density (464 per square km [70, 71]) and the
total population which is second highest in the world. Moreover, constant migration of
population between cities and countrysides, percentage of young population, inadequacy in
testing facility and several other effective factors (economical, social, religious as well as
political) can make the time evolution of the infected population in India very different than
that of many other countries.
In India, the first Covid-19 positive case was reported on January 30, 2020. Till March
03, the number of infected patients was limited to 6, but after that it started to rise as
many infected travelers returned to India from various parts of the world. To reduce the
widespread infection of this virus, the Government of India had imposed a lockdown starting
on March 24, which was subsequently extended till May 30. After then un-lockdown has
started in phases at different sectors to balance the economic slowdown. Many of its states
and cities have demarcated the containment zones and are periodically imposing further
27

lockdown measures at those places (some time a few days in a week to a more than a week
at a stretch) to contain the infection spread. As of August 10, the total number of infected
population is more than 2.2 million with a fatality rate of about 1.98% [64–66].
In Fig. 12, we plot the cumulative number of confirmed cases [64, 65] with the effective
starting date (t0 ) as March 02, 2020. Again we find an exponential increment followed by
a power-law-rise growth as in Eq. (1a). We fit the data with the combined equations. It is
interesting to note that αie and αi , till the middle of June, was on the lower side compared
to that of other countries with a smaller population, which signifies the effect of preventive
measures at the initial days. However, αi has started to increase after that (higher percentage
of infection is also correlated to the number of tests which has substantially increased during
this period).

The time evolution trajectory of the confirmed Covid-19 infected population for India

is shown. The red filled circles are actual data from Ref. [64]. Data up to July 31 are employed
to obtain parameters for Eq. (1) and projections for future evolution are shown by the black line.
The two bands show 68% and 95% confidence intervals.

As is evident from the recent data that the disease spread is surging ahead and there is
no signal for slowing down of infection even after passing more than 5 months by when many
countries are either in mitigation or saturation periods in the first wave of infection. This is
precisely due to a large number as well as density of population where the strict lockdown
measures cannot be maintained continuously for indefinite periods considering economical,
social and political factors. Considering these external factors, it is expected that the rising,
as well as mitigation periods of a contagious disease, will considerably be longer (and most

28

probably be the longest) compared to those of all other countries. Given that there is no
availability of an effective vaccine in the immediate future and it is not feasible to impose a
prolonged lockdown, other possible measures (strict social distancing, contact tracing, maskwearing, informing all levels of population about the disease transmission etc.) against this
contagious disease, which could well be airborne [1] must be strictly followed to avoid an
avalanche of infected population in next few months.
On Indian data, the main observation is that the mitigation period has not started yet.
Hence, at this moment, through our model it is not possible to project the time evolution
trajectory for a longer period in future. However, considering the current rate of infection we
project the possible scenario that may happen to the number of total infection in next three
weeks. Fits to the model suggest that, with the current trend, the cumulative number of
infection will cross 3.5 million at the end of August (Fig. 12). On a positive note, only very
recently the increment coefficient, αm (of Eq. (1b)), is found to be reducing, albeit slowly,
with its current value at 4.58. It will be interesting monitor if αm continues to reduce further
and the infection enters into the mitigation period. We will continuously monitor the disease
spread and will project the time evolution later more accurately with the availability of more
data.
Along with the whole Indian population, we also analyze data for its two biggest cities,
Mumbai and Delhi. Below we elaborate our analysis for these two cities and subsequently
project the most probable trajectory of infection for the next few months.
3.1 Mumbai
Mumbai is the largest city in India and also is one of the most densely populated cities in
the world (> 25000 per sq km with a total population more than 20 million [71]). Moreover,
the city has clusters of densely populated areas and a large number of migration happens
very frequently. Naturally it is intriguing to analyze the time evolution trajectory of Covid19 infection of such a city. The first reported case in the city of Mumbai was on March 11,
2020 and subsequently the infected number has increased substantially, and as of August
10, 2020, the total infected number is more than 124 thousand with a fatality rate of 5.55%
[67]. As in other parts of India, Mumbai was also under lockdown effectively from March
20, and gradual un-lockdown has started since the beginning of June while placing lockdown
measures at containment zones.

29

In Fig. 13, we plot the cumulative number of confirmed Covid-19-infected patients with
the effective starting date (t0 ) as March 14, 2020 [67]. This data also shows an exponential
increase followed by a power-rise growth in the initial days as in Eq. (1a). We fit the
data with the combined form and find αie = 0.176 and αi = 3.436 which are again smaller
compared to many other places. Perhaps this is due to strict lockdown measures at the
initial days. The transition from the rising to the mitigation period is found to be at time
tm = 81, which corresponds to around June 03, 2020. Due to its huge carrying population
density as well as the total population, it is expected that the mitigation period will be
much longer. With existing data we track the time evolution with Eq. (1) and the fitted
result is shown with the black solid line in Fig. 13. We also use Eq. (13) to find the time
evolution trajectory and the solutions with the restricted parameter space is shown by the
blue band. Results from this work, at this time, project that with the existing measures
of restriction against the infection spread, we expect to see the onset of saturation period,
with about 250 infection per day, around time tsi = 195 − 210 which corresponds to the
end September to early October, with a cumulative number of infection in between 145160 thousand. However, this will very much depend on the continuation of the prevailing
preventive measures against the disease spread, given the large unaffected population with
large density in Mumbai.

data (black point/line). The results obtained using Eq. (1) are shown by magenta and blue lines
respectively.

Similar to our study on England’s data we also perform a study on 5 days average data
of Mumbai. The results are shown in Fig. 14. As one can see that there is effectively no
difference between two results (magenta and blue lines), except a very small difference at
the saturation period. This shows that our method for obtaining parameters for Eq. (1) is
robust.
3.2 Delhi
Delhi is another highly populated city in the world. Like Mumbai, Delhi has also a
number of densely populated areas and everyday migration happens to and from Delhi. It
is thus also interesting to analyze the Covid-19 data on Delhi and compared it with that of
Mumbai. Below we elaborate our analysis on Delhi.
The first reported case on Covid-19 infection in the city of Delhi was on March 2. Subsequently the infected number has increased, and as of August 10, the total infected number
as reported is more than 146 thousand with a mortality rate of 2.82% [68], which is considerably lower than the same rate of Mumbai. As in other parts of India, Delhi was also
under lockdown from March 24 and gradual un-lockdown has initiated from the beginning
of June. However, unlike Mumbai, there was a sudden jump in the number of infection was
observed around fourth week of June, perhaps due to ease of lockdown and not maintaining
other preventive measures. Since then further measures against the disease spread have
31

been taken and the number of per day infected population has slowed down. In Fig. 15,
we plot the cumulative number of infected population [68] with the effective starting date
(t0 ) as March 2, 2020. This data also shows an exponential followed by a power-law-rise
form as in Eq. (1). We fit the data with the combined form and find αie = 0.186 and
αi = 4.82 which are larger than the corresponding exponents for Mumbai. The transition
from the rising to the mitigation period is found to be at time tm = 103, which again is
larger than Mumbai. This transition time corresponds to June 25, 2020. Due to its huge
carrying population density as well as the total number of population, we again expect that
the mitigation period will be longer. With the existing data, we track the time evolution
with Eq. (1) and the result is shown with the black solid line in Fig. 15. We also use Eq
(13) and solutions with the allowed parameters are shown by the blue band. Our projection
on further Covid-19 infection spread for Delhi is that with the sustained current measures
taken against disease spread, we expect to see the onset of saturation time (about 250 infections per day) around tsi = 180 − 190 which corresponds to around the end of September.
However, as mentioned earlier this will very much depend on whether existing preventive
measures can be maintained over the period. Our model suggests that the infection can be
contained substantially with the current measures against disease spread, and by the end
of September to the beginning of October it can be reduced to 250 per day with a cumulative infected population within 160-180 thousand. However, adequate precaution must
be taken even after that considering the large unaffected population and regular migration,
particularly as the city is trying to come back to its regular life.

4.

USA

At the end of this work, we analyze the data on Covid-19 infected population of USA.
It is also a populous country with a large number of big cities with large population. We
have already analyzed the data on New York City in the subsections A and B above. To
be noted that the infected population of New York City has already reached the saturation
period (stage 3 of Eq. (1), see Figs. 5 and 6). However, unlike New York City, currently
in many places in USA, the number of infected population are increasing quite rapidly. In
fact, the data on USA is quite interesting and has a unique feature which shows a big jump
in the number of infected population from a situation where there was a clear pattern of

reduction in the number of infected cases. Unlike many European countries and New York
City, the trajectory of the number of infected population in USA does not move towards
the saturation period. Rather it looks like a new wave of infection has started with another
initial power-law-rise increment and subsequent mitigation. For a contagious disease this
must be related to the change in measures against the disease spread by a large population.
In Fig. 16, we plot the cumulative number on infected population [1, 69] with the effective
starting date (t0 ) as February 27, 2020. Similar to most of the previous countries, this
data also shows an exponential increment followed by a power-law-rise, as in Eq. (1a). A
simultaneous fit with both forms yields αie = 0.3075 and αi = 2.744. This suggests, while the
early rise is much faster than many other countries the power-law rise was much slower. One
needs to remember that a substantial contribution of this part of the data came from New
York City for which αie = 0.5810 and αi = 1.619. One can argue from these two exponents
that the lockdown effect of New York City may have played a key role against the fast rise
of US infection at the earlier months of the infection. As mentioned earlier, one can observe
from the figure that the data after crossing about 100 days (with t0 at Feb 27, 2020) shows
a unique feature: instead of slowing down with the expected trajectory, as was observed in
most other countries, the number of infection surges once more with a power-law-rise form.

The time evolution trajectories of Covid-19 infected population (cumulative and per

day) for USA are shown. The red filled circles are actual data from Ref. [69]. Data up to July 31,
including both W a and W b (see text for details), are utilized to obtain parameters for Eq. (1).
Results from our model are shown by the black line. The trajectory without red points shows the
projection for the total number of infected population in next few months. The blue line represents
the result for only W a showing the possible trajectory that could have happened had the second
increment in W b not taken place. The two bands represent 68% and 95% confidence intervals (see
Appendix for details).

Indeed data after that can be fitted easily again with a power-law-rise form (Eq. (1a)).
Because of the above-mentioned unique feature of the trajectory we use a different analysis
strategy for this data. First, we try to find out a maximum time till which the total number
of infection can be analyzed like any other affected regions incorporating an early increment
of exponential-cum-power-law-rise followed by a mitigation period. We call that part of data
as W a. The maximum of W a is chosen dynamically with the usual condition of minimum
χ2 (W a)(= χ2i (W a) + χ2m (W a)). Then we introduce another exponential-cum-power-law-rise
followed by a mitigation period, considering as if there is a second wave. We call this part
of data as W b. We then dynamically choose the time of transition from W a to W b so that
the total χ2 = χ2 (W a) + χ2 (W b) becomes minimum within the acceptable limit. We find
the minimum χ2 fit leads to tm (W a) = 45, the transition time from W a to W b at around
time ttr = 103, and tm (W b) = 129 − 140. Interestingly in this way we could track the time
evolution of the total number of infection from the initial period to date very well. Result
using Eqs. (1a) and (1b) is shown in Fig. 16 with the black solid line, whereas the red
34

solid line represents the actual data [1, 69]. To be noted that the power-law-rise exponent
αi in W b (5.594) is much bigger than its corresponding value in W a (2.744). In fact, it is
the biggest among all other power-law-rise exponents for any affected regions that we study.
This is a clear signal that the infection had spread very rapidly in the early period of W b,
and unless adequate measures are imposed against the disease spread a substantial increase
in the number of infection is expected in foreseeable future. However, on a positive note,
it is worthwhile to mention that our model also allows a possibility that another mitigation
period has started, albeit slow, at around t = 129 − 140, i.e., around the second week of
July. With this slow rate of mitigation, and in no change in existing conditions, this disease
can rise another 2.5-3 months infecting about 6.5-7 million people (shown by the black line
in Fig. 16), before reaching to the saturation period with less than about 3000 infections
per day by the end of October to the beginning of November. Thereafter the onset of
saturation period can possibly be achieved by maintaining the same restrictions against the
infection spread. We project this as the ideal case scenario with continuation of the existing
restrictions and current trend of reduction. Although this is an ideal situation and in reality
there will be deviation in restrictions and so in this projection, still this can be taken as
a possible scenario. However, if the current value of the percentage of per day increment
sustains and does not reduce further in the next 2 weeks, this situation can change. We will
discuss next about such a possible situation with a set of speculated data.
Before that, here one point is worthwhile to mention that had the infection trajectory
follow the similar pattern as that of most other countries (i.e., without W b, as shown by the
blue line in Fig. 16), around 150 days (i.e., by now) the onset of saturation period would had
started with a much reduced number of infections (about 3000 per day). This is strongly
indicative that by maintaining the measures against the infection spread for longer time, as
it was in the early days of W a, perhaps the disease spread could have been substantially
contained by now and perhaps the onset of saturation period could have happened as well!
4.1 A speculative but possible scenario:
At the end we would discuss about a speculative scenario on the disease spread in next
few months based on a speculative set of data for next 2 weeks. We make following two
assumptions: i) in next two weeks the number of per day infection does not increase more
than 1.25% of previous day’s number (current rate is about 1.1-1.2%) and ii) it also does

35

not decrease less than 0.9%. With these assumptions we generate a set of speculative data
for next 2 weeks. We then use this data, and use our model, with tm (W b) = 129, to get the
future trajectory. In Fig. 17 we show the corresponding results. The speculative data is
shown with the blue line and the projection is shown by the green line. The original data till
August 10 is shown with the red line, and projection with the same tm is represented by the
black line. This speculative scenario points that if the percentage of infection, as mentioned
above, does not decrease further in next 2 weeks and sustains in between 0.9-1.25%, then
within this model there is high possibility (95% confidence intervals) that the number of
infection by the end of October will be about 7-7.5 million with 10000-15000 infections per
day.

TABLE II: Current projections for several regions where Covid-19 disease is spreading. For USA
two possible situations are shown (see text for details). These projections are made within 95% confidence intervals of the proposed model assuming there will be no change in the existing conditions
at these places.

a common pattern of infection over a long time-period irrespective of different prevailing
conditions at the affected regions. The total infection time can broadly be divided into
three periods: i) initial increment with an exponential rate followed by a power-law rise or
simply a power-law rise from the beginning, ii) a mitigation period and iii) a saturation
period. Of course, the transitions from one period to the next one is a smooth cross-over
without any discontinuity. We propose a mathematical model for the time evolution of the
number of infected population and show that it can very well track the number of infected
population at various affected regions, from the initial days to saturation period. Based
on the proposed mathematical trajectory we then formulate a set of differential equations
which can equally well describe the same time evolution. The parameters of the model
(for both the mathematical trajectory (Eq. (1)) and differential equations (Eq.(13)) are
extracted by dynamically performing a simultaneous χ2 -minimization against the available
data. Our proposed model is then employed to project the probable number of infected
population in future till the saturation period is reached. To demonstrate the predictive
ability of the model we use a subset of the data and show that using the proposed model

37

we can project the future time evolution of the number of total infected population from a
week to a month and even more. Projection from this model can be progressively improved
by including more and more data. However, it is based on the assumption that the existing
measures against the disease spread remain to be the same throughout this period and
the affected region is isolated (i.e., new infections are not coming from outside). After
validation and showing the predictive ability of our model, we analyze the similar data on
a number of other countries where Covid-19 infection is currently increasing rapidly. We
observe that for Russia the per day infection has already peaked around May 10, and it
is heading towards the onset of saturation period. With the continuation of the existing
measures against the disease spread, we expect to see the onset of saturation period by
the end of September to the beginning of October with less than 500 infections per day
and the cumulative number of infected population around 0.95 − 1.1 million. For Brazil,
our finding is that it is now crossing the peak of disease spread (that is per day maximum
number of infection). However, due to large unaffected population and the unavailability
of an effective vaccine, its mitigation period will be prolonged. With the existing measures
against the disease spread we expect to see the onset of the saturation period by the middle
of November to the middle of December, with 5.5 − 6.5 million cumulative infection and
less than 2500 infection per day. Our analysis on India shows that it is still in the powerlaw rise period even after passing more than 5 months of the disease spread. With the
current trend of infection we expect that there would be more than 3 million infection by
the end of August. We also expect that even with the continuation of the existing measures
against the diseases spread, the mitigation period will be quite long considering its huge
unaffected population. Hence it is even more important to maintain the existing measures
against the disease spread, at least for the next few months, given that no effective vaccine
would be available before that. We will continue to monitor the disease propagation and
progressively improve our projection on the future trajectory with the availability of more
data3 . We also analyze data on two of its biggest cities: Mumbai and Delhi. For Mumbai,
our finding is that it has entered into the mitigation period. If the current conditions against
the disease spread can be continued throughout, by the beginning of October we expect to

see the onset of saturation period, with the cumulative infected population about 145-160
thousand and with less than 250 infections per day. For Delhi, we project that the onset
of saturation period, with a cumulative number of infection of about 160-180 thousand and
per day infections below 250, can be achieved by the end of September to the beginning of
October. Finally on USA’s data, we find that there is a distinct feature in the time evolution
trajectory. Our model clearly shows that this data can be explained very well by allowing
two waves of infection: first one with the usual exponential-cum-power-rise followed by a
mitigation period up to a time, and then the second one started with that mitigated number
with a power-rise followed by a very slow mitigation. The exponent in the second power-rise
is bigger than that of the first one suggesting a very large number of population can get
infected if adequate preventive measures against it are not followed. Our result also shows
that had the mitigation period continued for the first wave, by now, a saturation period
with much less number of infection could have been achieved. With the current rate of slow
mitigation, but with existing restrictions, we project that this disease can rise another 3-4
months infecting about 6.5 − 7 million people, before reaching to the saturation period with
less than 5000 infections per day. However, we project this as an ideal case scenario. If
the rate of per day increment remains within 0.9-1.25% and no further reduction happens
in next 2 weeks, within a speculative scenario, we show that the total number of infection
can be around 7-7.5 million by the early November, with more than 10000-12000 infections
per day. All the projections are made with 95% confidence intervals in the proposed model
given the reported available data. These projections can be progressively improved with the
availability of more data in next few weeks3 . We summarize these projections in Table II.
In the proposed model the parameters are assumed to be mean-field-type effective parameters with no time and other dependences. However, in reality, there is a number of external
parameters, which could be environmental, medical, economical, social as well as political.
It is not clear how the model parameters are correlated with those external factors, and it
would be worthwhile to study their inter-relations. Such a study is necessary to understand
the significance of the model parameters. It may be possible to constrain the parameters
more stringently using some other data, for example, the number of active cases and the
number of fatalities. We will pursue such a study in future. The predictive ability of the
model can be improved further if it is possible to find a robust method to quantify the errors
in the reported data.

APPENDIX

Here we show some of the numerical details, particularly describing the method employed
for obtaining the confidence intervals.
For a given data set {days, number of infection and error ≡ t, y(t) and σ(t), t = 1, ..., N }
and the model function (f (t)), where f (t) is the time evolution trajectory as in Eqs. (1)
and (13), we calculate the minimum of χ2 , defined as
χ2 (f ) =

N
X
(y(t) − f (t))2
t=1

σ 2 (t)

.

(16)

A non-linear fitting method is utilized for the minimization. The total minimum χ2 is obtained by fitting all periods simultaneously (by varying te , tm , tsi together). For Eq. (13) this
minimization is performed for each trajectory with a given set of parameters and we choose
only those which are within the acceptable minimum χ2 . The non-linear fitting method
employed here has been extensively used previously for lattice gauge theory calculations
and data analysis [72–74].
To maximize the probability of the observed data given the model, we follow Ref. [75]
and calculate the likelihood of the parameters, defined as
L=

N
Y

p (yi |xi , σyi , {α}) .

(17)

i=1

Here we use the generic notation x for time (t) and {α} represents all parameters of the
model, and the frequency distribution p (yi |xi , σyi , {α}) is taken to be Gaussian

We then adopt the Bayesian way of data-analysis [76] using
p(model|data) =

p(data|model)p(model)
,
p(data)

(19)

to generalize the above frequency distribution as

p {α}|{yi }N

(20)

where
• I : all the prior knowledge of the data and the problem.
• p ({α}|I): the prior probability distribution for the parameters ({α}) that represents
all knowledge except the data

• p {α}|{yi }N
i=1 , I : the posterior probability distribution for the parameters ({α}) with
the given data and the prior knowledge

• p {yi }N
i=1 |I : A normalization constant
One gets the peak of the posterior probability at the best-fit values of the parameters ({α})
while its moments provide the uncertainties of these parameters.
Since the above posterior probability distribution with the given number of parameters of
our model is quite complicated, we adopt a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method to
generate this distribution with the given data set and model. The priors for the parameters
are chosen uniformly within the relevant ranges. We use more than 50000 MCMC steps
in most cases after suitably adjusting the autocorrelation times. Each MCMC steps are
initialized with a Gaussian ball around the maximum likelihood result.
In Fig. 18 we show the projections of the posterior probability distributions of model
parameters for the mitigation period. Since this period is most complicated as well as
important and more number of parameters are involved, we choose this period to show
results from the above-mentioned analysis method. Fig. 18 is for the data on USA and
the extracted parameters correspond to Fig. 16. The bands represent the one, two and
three sigma confidence intervals. In Fig. 19 we show similar results for the NY city in its
saturation period.
Finally the fitted error in the cumulative number of infection, particularly for projection
purpose, was calculated by bootstrapping the MCMC samples. In Figs. 16 and 17 we show
such errors by 68% and 95% confidence intervals.
