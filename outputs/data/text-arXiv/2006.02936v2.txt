Abstract
In December 2019, a newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus was emerged from China and
propagated worldwide as a pandemic, resulting in about 35% mortality. In the absence
of preventive medicine or a ready to use vaccine, mathematical models can provide useful
scientific insights about transmission patterns and targets for drug development. In this
study, we propose a within-host mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 infection considering innate and adaptive immune responses. We analyze the equilibrium points of the
proposed model and obtain an expression of the basic reproduction number. We then
numerically show the existence of a transcritical bifurcation. The proposed model is calibrated to real viral load data of two COVID-19 patients. Using the estimated parameters,
we perform global sensitivity analysis with respect to the peak of viral load. Finally, we
study the efficacy of antiviral drugs and vaccination on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2
infection. Our results suggest that blocking the production of the virus by infected cells
decreases the viral load more than reducing the infection rate of healthy cells. Vaccination is also found useful but during the vaccine development phase, blocking virus
production from infected cells can be targeted for antiviral drug development.

1. Introduction
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that have the potential to transmit between hosts. These are enveloped in positive-sense, non-segmented RNA viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family (Nidovirales order) and widely distributed in humans and
other mammals [1]. The virus is responsible for a range of symptoms including fever,
cough, and shortness of breath [1]. Some patients have reported radiographic changes
in their ground-glass lungs, healthy or lower than average white blood cell lymphocyte,

and platelet counts; hypoxaemia; and deranged liver and renal function. Since first discovery and identification of coronavirus in 1965, three significant outbreaks occurred,
caused by emerging, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, namely the 2003 outbreak of ”Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome” (SARS) in mainland China [2, 3], the 2012 outbreak
of ”Middle East Respiratory Syndrome” (MERS) in Saudi Arabia [4, 5], and the 2015
outbreak of MERS in South Korea [6, 7, 8]. These outbreaks resulted in SARS and
MERS cases confirmed by more than 8000 and 2400, respectively [9]. A newer and genetically similar coronavirus is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The virus is named SARS-CoV-2. Despite a relatively lower case fatality rate compared
to SARS and MERS, the COVID-19 spreads rapidly and infects more people than the
SARS and MERS. Despite strict intervention measures implemented in the region where
the COVID-19 was originated, the infection spread locally and elsewhere very rapidly.
COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in January
2020. Since its first isolation in Wuhan, China in December 2019, it has caused outbreak with more than 10 million confirmed infections and above 500 thousand reported
deaths worldwide as of 28 June 2020. The affected countries around the globe are fighting the virus by implementing social distancing and isolation strategies. Unfortunately,
the COVID-19 has neither a preventive medicine nor a ready to use vaccine. Multiple approaches are adopted in the development of Coronavirus vaccines; most of these
targets the surface-exposed spike (S) glycoprotein or S protein as the primary inducer
of neutralizing antibodies [10, 11]. In fact, either monoclonal antibody or vaccine approaches have failed to neutralize and protect from previous coronavirus infections [12].
Therefore, individual behaviour (e.g. early self-isolation and social distancing), as well as
preventive measures such as hand washing, covering when coughing, are critical to control the spread of COVID-19 [13]. However, researchers have been putting more effort
into finding a solution to this pandemic situation [14, 15, 16].
In addition to medical and biological research, theoretical studies based on mathematical models may also play an important role throughout this anti-epidemic fight
in understanding the epidemic character traits of the outbreak, in having to decide on
the measures to reduce the spread and in understanding within-host patterns of virus
transmission. While there are many mathematical models developed at an epidemiological level for COVID-19 [17, 18, 19, 20], there are very few within-host level studies to
understand SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and its interactions with the innate and adaptive immune responses [21, 13]. In these few previous studies, authors studied target
cell models and target cell models with eclipse phase. Therefore, detailed research with
immune responses is necessary for the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 spread inside the
human body. The human immune system is comprised of innate and adaptive immune
responses. While the adaptive immune system is both fast and effective at targeting

2

invasions by previously encountered pathogens, its role in host defence in the first days
of a new infection is secondary to that of the innate immune system.
Motivated by this discussion, we aim to develop a within-host mathematical model of
SARS-CoV-2 infection considering human immune responses. This model can be used as
a basis for understanding characterized patterns of disease severity in humans. Moreover,
we intend to use real viral load data from COVID-19 positive patients to calibrate the
proposed model so that the parameters are realistic for further inference. The main
goal is to compare the efficacy of various antiviral drugs and identify the most beneficial
target.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we formulate the compartmental model of within human SARS-CoV-2 transmission; the equilibrium points
of the proposed model are analyzed and the basic reproduction number is obtained in
Section 3; viral load time series, transcritical bifurcation, fitting model to real data and
global sensitivity analysis are presented in Section 4; in Section 5, we study the efficacy
of antiviral drugs and vaccination; finally, the obtained results are discussed in Section
6.
2. The mathematical model
A deterministic ordinary differential equation model describing cell–virus–immune
response interaction dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection is being formulated. Timedependent state variables are taken to represent the compartments. A general mathematical model for the underlying dynamics of virus-host cell interaction has been studied
in this context [21, 13]. However, the basic principles that underlay models of virus
dynamics are as follows: Healthy uninfected cells, H(t), are infected when they meet
free viruses, V (t). Infected cells, I(t), produce new virus particles that leave the cell
and find other susceptible target cells. Whenever a human is infected with SARS-CoV2, his innate and adaptive immune responses work together to neutralize the threat of
SARS-CoV-2 infection [22, 23, 16]. The innate immune response works non-specifically
and immediately after the viral attack. Cells and proteins of the innate immune system
are ever-present in a healthy host and can respond to invading pathogens within the first
minutes and hours of infection [24]. This system is of great importance in the sense that
it is preventing the establishment of new infections during the activation time of the
adaptive immune system. It is believed that Cytokines are an essential component of the
immune system [25]. They are a family of small soluble proteins secreted by different
cells. They can be loosely classified into one of four families: the haematopoietins, the
immunoglobin superfamily, the tumour necrosis factor family and the interferons (IFN).
Cytokines modulate the balance between innate and adaptive immune responses. The
IFNs are perhaps the most critical cytokines in the initial innate response to viral in3

fection. They are classified into two types: IFN-α (a family of related proteins) and
the single protein IFN-β together form type I; IFN-γ is the sole and unrelated type II
IFN. IFN-α and IFN-β are secreted by cells in response to viral infection and promote
an antiviral response in otherwise susceptible cells. Cytokines C(t) is vital in inhibiting
viral replication and modulating downstream effects of the immune response. Specific
cytokines activate natural killer (NK) cells N(t), which play an essential role in killing
virus-infected cells. As in [26, 27], the rate of NK cells increment by cytokines is taken
as rC, whereas NK cells die at a rate µ5 . However, Against the inhibiting mechanism of
cytokines, the viruses often target the JaK/STAT pathway to decrease the production of
IFNs. This mechanism, known as immunosupression, is observed for SARS-CoV-2 [28].
k2 I
The functional form of a decrease in the cytokine production rate is assumed to be 1+γV
.
Meanwhile, cytokines also activate the adaptive immune system, mainly the cytotoxic
T-lymphocytes T(t) at a rate λ1 . Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a type of cytokine signaling
molecule in the immune system that is very important to activate T-cells. T-cells finds
virus infected cells and kill them at a rate p1 . T-cells subsequently activate B-lymphocytes
B(t) at a rate λ2 to produce antibody against the virus. B-cells mainly secrete IgM and
IgG antibodies that are released in the blood and lymph fluid, where they specifically
recognize and neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 viral particles [25, 22]. Meanwhile, antibody
levels A(t) are increasing with the aim of halting infection (and in future providing
protection against a subsequent infection). A schematic flow diagram of the model is
depicted in Fig. 1.
Finally, the cell–virus–immune response interaction dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are governed by the following system of differential equations:

indicate activation and orange ones show inhibition by different cells.

The time delay τ introduced through the Heaviside step function [29], is the time
period that is required for the first production of antibodies after the T-lymphocytes
and B-lymphocytes interact. This delay is biologically significant since the production of
antibodies after the virions have associated with the B-lymphocytes is a complex process
involving multiple steps. The B-cells have to undergo differentiations before they can be
transformed into the plasma cells capable of producing antibodies [30]. The Heaviside
step function G(t) is defined as follows,

G(t − τ ) = 1, if t > τ
= 0, if t < τ

Clearly, −µ1 , −µ4 , −µ5 , −µ6 , −µ7 and −µ8 are eigenvalues of this Jacobean matrix
and other two eigenvalues are given by the roots of the following equation

C(Λ) := Λ2 + a1 Λ + a2 = 0
(3.3)
where
a1 = µ2 + µ3
a2 = µ2 µ3 (1 − R0 )
(3.4)
Therefore, for R0 < 1, the conditions for the Routh-Hurwitz criteria are satisfied and
hence DFE is locally asymptotically stable. Now if R0 > 1, then a2 < 0 and C(λ) = 0
will possess a positive real solution. Therefore the DFE will be unstable for R0 > 1.
Hence the proof follows.
The stability of the other three equilibrium points is complicated and does not lead to
biologically relevant stability conditions. Therefore, we explore model solutions, relevant
model dynamics, important parameters, agreement with real data through numerical
simulations.
4. Numerical Simulation
In this section, important properties of the proposed model are investigated numerically. Using different parameter settings, time series and threshold analysis is performed.
Moreover, the agreement of the model solution with real data is explored. Through out
this section the following set of initial conditions is used unless stated H(0) = 4 × 105
cells per ml, I(0) = 3 × 10−4 cells per ml, V (0) = 357 RNA copies per ml, C = 0 cells
per ml, N = 100 cells per ml, T = 500 cells per ml, B = 100 cells per ml and A = 0
molecules per ml (most of the initial conditions are taken from [25, 31]).
4.1. Time series and threshold analysis
We first study the time series of the viral load and antibody count. In Fig. 2, the viral
load and antibody are plotted. The viral load time series experiences a peak between
sixth and seven days post infection. However, as soon as the adaptive immune response is
activated (after τ = 7 days), a sharp decrease is observed in the viral load. On the other
hand, the antibody count starts to rise after 7 days post infection and shows saturated
type behaviour.

parameters are taken from Table 1 except β = 2 × 10−8 , µ2 = 0.65, µ3 = 0.9, p2 = 0.001, p3 = 0.05,
k1 = 500, k2 = 5, η = 0.05 and τ = 7.

Further, we study the threshold for R0 . It is observed that R0 = 1 acts as a critical
value for the persistence of virus particles. The virus particles converges to the DFE of
the model 2.1 for R0 < 1 and the viral load converges to a non-zero value as soon as
R0 crosses unity. This type of phenomenon is called forward bifurcation where the two
equilibrium points switches their stability at a critical value. The diagram is depicted in
Fig. 3. This also ensure that if we vary other parameters involved in the expression of
R0 , the same type of phenomenon occurs. Thus, in turn parameters such as β and k1
can be reduced so as to reduce R0 below unity.
4.2. Model validation using real data
SARS-CoV-2 viral load data are obtained from Wolfel et al. [34]. They studied
patients from a hospital in Munich, Germany. They reported Daily measurements of
viral load in sputum, pharyngeal swabs and stool for 9 patients. Among these patients,
there were two patients (namely, patient A and patient B) for whom the growth phase
of sputum data was captured. We therefore utilized these two datasets for our analysis.
The data was collected from Wolfel et al. [34] using a online software [35].
The solution curve of viral load (V (t)) is fitted to data using the built-in (MATLAB,
R2018a) simplex algorithm to minimize the sum of squares difference between simulated
indicators and data. We used the MATLAB function ‘fminsearchbnd’ to perform the
optimization. During the computation, 100 different starting points in parameter space
were chosen using Latin Hypercube Sampling to ensure consistency and uniqueness of
the parameter estimates. The fitting is displayed in Fig. 4(a) for patient A and in Fig.
4(b) for patient B. The fixed parameters are taken from Table 1 with µ2 = 0.65, k2 = 5
and η = 0.05. The initial conditions are taken as mentioned in the beginning of Section
4. We estimated five parameters directly related to viral load of a patient viz., β, k1 , p2 ,
p3 and µ3 . The estimated parameters for patient A are found to be β = 1.7505 × 10−6 ,
k1 = 379, p2 = 0.2805, p3 = 0.0316 and µ3 = 0.8108. Similarly, the estimates for patient

B are obtained as β = 5.561 × 10−7 , k1 = 128, p2 = 0.9403, p3 = 0.0057 and µ3 = 0.99.
4.3. Sensitivity analysis
We performed global sensitivity analysis to identify most influential parameters with
respect to the maximum size (or alternatively, the peak of load) of virus particles (Vmax )
in 3 months time frame. Partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCCs) are calculated and
plotted in Fig. 5. Nonlinear and monotone relationship were observed for the parameters
with respect to Vmax , which is a prerequisite for performing PRCC analysis. Following
Marino et. al [36], we calculate PRCCs for the parameters β, k1 , k2 , µ2 , µ3 , p2 , p3 , γ and
η. The base values for the parameters β, k1 , p2 , p3 and µ3 are taken as the average of
estimated parameters of patient A and patient B. The other base values are µ2 = 0.65,
k2 = 5, γ = 0.5 and η = 0.05. For each of the parameters, 500 Latin Hypercube Samples
were generated from the interval (0.5 × base value, 1.5 × base value).
It is observed that the parameters β, k1 and γ has significant positive correlations
with Vmax . This indicates that the production rate of virus particles from infected cells
will increase the chance of larger infection propagation. Besides, the infection rate and
the immiunosuppresion rate are positively correlated with the peak of viral load. On the
other hand, the natural death rate of infected cells and death rate of virus particles will
have significant negative correlation with Vmax . The production rate of cytokines is also

negatively correlated with Vmax . These results reinforces the fact that β and k1 are very
crucial for reduction of viral load.
5. Model with antiviral treatment
Antiviral drugs can be used to slow SARS-CoV-2 infection or block production of
virus particles. These drugs will necessarily save the lives of many severely ill patients
and will reduce the time spent in intensive care units for patients, vacating hospital beds.
Antiviral medications will, in turn, inhibit subsequent transmission that could happen if
the drugs were not given. However, to analyze the effect of antiviral treatment, we consider drugs can block infection and/or production of virus particles. Many studies have
suggested various existing compounds for testing [16, 37, 38] as SARS-CoV-2 antiviral
drug, but World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing on the following four therapies:
an experimental antiviral compound called remdesivir; the malaria medications chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; a combination of two HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir;
and that same combination plus interferon-beta, an immune system messenger that can
help cripple viruses [39].
Following Zitzmann et al. [40], we incorporate antiviral drug treatment in the proposed model (2.1). The modified system with antiviral treatment is given by

reduce both peak of viral load and duration of high viral load. Thus, we conclude that
blocking the virus production from infected cells is a more suitable target for antiviral
drug development.
Finally, we study the effect vaccination in the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in
humans. A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity
to a particular infectious agent. Thus if an individual is vaccinated, there will be no
delay in the development of antibody. Therefore, the delay term τ is taken to be zero for
vaccinated individuals (see Fig. 7). It is observed that vaccination not only reduces the
viral load in healthy patients but also reduces the duration of high viremia.
Overall, for antiviral drug target, blocking virus production is more fruitful in terms
of viral load reduction and vaccination will also be effective.
6. Discussion and conclusion
In this study, we have proposed and analyzed a compartmental model of SARS-CoV2 transmission within the human body. The much needed innate and adaptive immune
responses are incorporated into the model. The eight-dimensional model has four types of
equilibrium points. The existence criterion for each type of equilibria is presented. From
the local stability of the DFE, the expression for basic reproduction number is obtained.
This number is very crucial for the persistence of the virus in the long run. However,
the short-term dynamics of the viral load is studied using various numerical techniques.
During time series analysis, we observed that the viral load time series experiences a
peak between sixth and seven days post-infection, followed by a sharp decrease due to
activation of adaptive immune response (see Fig. 2). A forward bifurcation of equilibria
with respect to the basic reproduction number is observed and depicted in Fig. 3. This
also ensures that if we suitably vary parameters involved in the expression of R0 , the

same type of phenomenon occurs. Thus, in turn, parameters such as β and k1 can be
decreased to reduce R0 below unity and ensure local asymptotic stability of DFE.
We used daily measurements of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in sputum for two patients
[34] from a hospital in Munich, Germany. Using the estimated parameters, the global
sensitivity analysis of several model parameters with respect to peak viral load is performed. The results indicate that the production rate of virus particles from infected cells
will increase the chance of more significant infection propagation. Besides, the infection
rate and the immiunosuppresion rate will increase the peak of viral load. Additionally,
the natural death rates of infected cells and the death rate of virus particles will have
a significant negative correlation with the peak of viral load. The production rate of
cytokines is also negatively correlated with the peak of viral load. These results reinforce
the fact that β and k1 are very crucial for the reduction of viral load.
Antiviral drugs can be used to slow SARS-CoV-2 infection (or reduce β) or block the
production of virus particles (or reduce k1 ). Results suggest that a decrease in β reduces
the peak of viral load but the duration of the high viral load remains the same. On the
other hand, a decrease in k1 significantly reduce both peak of viral load and period of
high viral load. Thus, we conclude that blocking virus production from infected cells is
a more suitable target for antiviral drug development. Moreover, vaccination can reduce
14

the viral load in healthy patients and also reduce the duration of high viremia in the body.
But vaccine development is a complicated task; therefore, during the vaccine development
phase, blocking virus production from infected cells can be targeted for antiviral drug
development.
Researchers have been putting more effort to develop a vaccine to tackle COVID19 [10, 11]. The journey has started with the first clinical trial just two months after
the genetic sequence of the virus. The mathematical model developed in this paper
can be improved by adding more detailed data to reveal prophylactic and therapeutic
interventions. Our theoretical findings should be tested clinically for the implementation.
Further insights into immunology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 will help to improve
the outcome of this and future pandemics.
