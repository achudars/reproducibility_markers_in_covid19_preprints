Abstract
The recent Covid-19 epidemic has lead to comparisons of the countries suffering from it. These
are based on the number of excess deaths attributed either directly or indirectly to the epidemic.
Unfortunately the data on which such comparisons rely are often incomplete and unreliable. This
article discusses problems of interpretation of data even when the data is largely accurate and delayed
by at most two to three weeks. This applies to the Office of National Statistics in the UK, the
Statistisches Bundesamt in Germany and the Belgian statistical office Statbel. The data in the article
is taken from these three sources. The number of excess deaths is defined as the number of deaths
minus the baseline, the definition of which varies from country to country. In the UK it is the average
number of deaths over the last five years, in Germany it is over the last four years and in Belgium
over the last 11 years. This means that in all cases the individual baselines depend strongly on the
timing and intensity of adverse factors such as past influenza epidemics and heat waves. This makes
cross-country comparisons difficult. A baseline defined as the number the number of deaths in the
absence of adverse factors can be operationalized by taking say the 10% quantile of the number of
deaths. This varies little over time and European countries within given age groups. It therefore
enables more robust and accurate comparisons of different countries. The article criticizes the use of
Z-scores to measure the degree to which the countries have been hit by the corona-virus. It has been
claimed that Z-scores allow direct comparisons between the countries involved. It is argued below
that the opposite is the case, the Z-scores distort the actual situation as, among other weaknesses, they
do not take the size of the countries into account. Finally the problem of describing past epidemics
by their timing, that is start and finish and time of the maximum, and by their effect, the height of the
maximum and the total number of deaths, is considered. A similar problem occurs when analysing
peaks in X-Ray diffractograms.

Introduction

Data on Covid-19 deaths are often unreliable. In Germany the number of Covid-19 deaths given
by the Statistisches Bundesamt is taken from the Robert Koch Institute which requires a blood
test confirming the presence of the corona virus at the time of death, symptoms are not sufficient.
In the UK a death certificate signed by a doctor giving Covid-19 as the cause of death would be
accepted even if the the judgment of the doctor was based purely on the symptoms. People may
also die due to reasons only indirectly attributable to the disease: patients may be refused treatment
because of the strain put on medical services, others may not even seek hospital treatment through
fear of contracting the disease.
For these and other reasons it has been suggested that excess deaths may give a more reliable
measure of the effect of the Covid-19. Excess deaths are defined as the difference between the
number of present deaths and a baseline, typically defined historically as the average number of
deaths over previous years. The number of deaths can be usually be accurately determined, the
main problem is that of delays. For example on the 27th May Spain increased the number of
deaths by 12000 backdated to early March. To avoid such problems this paper only uses data from
the UK, and in particular England and Wales, Germany and Belgium. The data is accurate and
up-to-date with Germany being the laggard with delays of about three weeks. The sources are the
Office of National Statistics for the UK, the Statistisches Bundesamt for Germany and the Belgian
statistical office Statbel for Belgium. However even with such data the there still remain problems
of comparing excess deaths. The reason is the effect of past influenza epidemics on the excess
deaths calculated today. In 2018 there was a major influenza epidemic in Germany. If this one
year is removed from the baseline the number of excess deaths for the weeks 11-21 increases from
7602 to 11639. It is as though the influenza epidemic of 2018 masks about 4000 excess deaths.
The problem can largely be avoided by taking the baseline to be the 10% quantile rather than the
2

mean of deaths of previous years.
One widely used statistic for comparing excess deaths across countries is the Z-score. In
particular it is the main means of comparison used by Euromomo
https://www.euromomo.eu/
Under the “Objectives” one reads

The aim of the EuroMOMO project (European monitoring of excess mortality for public
health action) is to operate coordinated timely mortality monitoring and analyses in as
many European countries as possible, using a standardized approach to ensure that signals
are comparable between countries.

and under the heading “What is a z-score?”

Z-scores are used to standardize series and enable comparison mortality pattern between different populations or between different time periods. The standard deviation is
the unit of measurement of the Z-score. It allows comparison of observations from different
normal distributions.

Unfortunately comparison of Z-scores without knowledge of the population sizes is impossible. Such comparisons can distort the effects of an epidemic in different countries by a large factor.
We show why this is so and why the use of Z-scores should be abandoned. It can be replaced with
the much more intuitive concept of a P-score.
Epidemics exhibit themselves in the data as peaks. Quantifying epidemics is then the problems
of localizing and evaluating the sizes of peaks. In the context of epidemics we take this to mean the
quantification of an epidemic through its start and finish, its peak and the total number of deaths it
caused. A similar problem occurs in the X-Ray diffractograms and we adopt the approach taken
in [Davies et al., 2008].

Excess deaths, the baseline and the age distribution

The number of excess deaths in any week is defined as the number of deaths in that week minus
the baseline for that week. Little attention has been given to the baseline, in particular there seem
to be no comparisons of the baselines of different countries. To show how large the baseline effect
can be we consider data for England and Wales, Germany and Belgium.

2.1

Historical baselines

The top panel of Figure 1 shows the number of weekly deaths per million of population for England and Wales for the years 2015-2019. The centre panel shows the same for Germany for the
years 2016-2019 and the bottom panel the same for Belgium for the years 2009-2019. We note
that there are large drops in the number of weekly deaths in England and Wales for weeks which
include the Spring, Summer and Christmas Bank Holidays. These disappear if daily data is considered as shown in Figure 2 which plots the daily deaths from 2011-2014. All sets of data show
influenza epidemics of varying intensity and length. The German and Belgian data also show
deaths due to summer heat waves.
The baselines derived from the two three data sets are shown in Figure 3, that for and England
and Wales by (o), for Germany by (+) and Belgium by (*). The three outliers in the England-Wales
baseline are the Spring, Summer and Christmas Public holidays mentioned above. The influenza
epidemics are visible in all baselines with the peak of the German epidemics occurring about six
week later than those of England and Wales. The increase in deaths due to heat waves is also
visible in the German baseline and to a lesser extent in the Belgium baseline.

2.2

Age distribution

The main difference between the the baselines in the top panel is that the German one is clearly
higher than than the other two. This is due to the difference in age distributions. England and
Wales have a median age of about 40, Germany one of 47 and Belgium one of 42. There are about
11 million people over the age of 65 in England and Wales, about 17.5 million in Germany and 2.2
million in Belgium. The respective populations are approximately 59, 83 and 11.5 million so that
the proportion of people over the age of 65 are respectively 18.6%, 21.1% and 19%. The effect
can be eliminated to some extent by restricting attention to a particular age groups and calculating
a baseline for each age group. We do this for the age groups over 65 and under 65 shown in the
centre and bottom panels. The England and Wales baseline for age group under 65 is somewhat
erratic.
The top panel of Figure 4 shows the number of excess deaths for the first 21 weeks of 2020
derived from the baselines of Figure 3 for England and Wales (o), for Germany (+) and Belgium
(*). The centre and bottom panels show the same for the ages groups over 65 and under 65
respectively.
Figure 1 and the baselines of Figure 3 show that the influenza epidemics in Germany are more
variable than those in England and Wales and that they peak at about week nine against week two in
4

England and Wales. This suggests that the German excess death numbers are strongly influenced
by the choice of the historical baseline. The German baseline of the top panel of Figure 3 results in
7602 excess deaths for the weeks 11:23. If the year 2018 is removed from the baseline the number
becomes 11639. Thus the influenza epidemic of 2018 reduces the number of excess deaths by
about 4000. One can also look at the timing of the Covid-19 epidemic. If we shift the data for
weeks 11-23 to 10-22 , that is one week earlier, the number of excess deaths would have been
2760, if it had occurred one week later the number would have been 12094. The corresponding
numbers for England and Wales are 57088 and 63088 and for for Belgium 8446 and 9289.
The variability of the historical baselines is ignored in all discussions of the Covid-19 epidemic. We propose another definition of the baseline, namely the number of deaths in the absence
of any detrimental causes such as influenza epidemics and heat waves. Other causes could be
listed from road deaths to the absence of health care but in the context of Covid-19 we consider
only influenza and heat waves. Based on this we suggest the median of the 10th quantile of the
weekly number of deaths over previous years. The values of the 10% quantiles are given in Table 1. They are remarkably constant over the years. The median of the four 10% quantiles all ages
for Germany is 192 which results in 363 excess deaths per million of the population for the weeks
11-21. If the individual 10% quantiles of the four years are used the number of excess deaths per
million of the population ranges from 330 to 396. I

Table 1: 10% quantiles of weekly excess deaths per million of the population for the years 20162019 for England and Wales, Germany and Belgium for the age groups 0+, 65+ and 65-

Daily data are available for England and Wales for 1970-2014. The 10% quantile is 1289 daily
deaths. Multiplying by seven and dividing by 59 to give number of weekly deaths per million of
the population results in the value 152.9 agreeing very well with Table 1. The same procedure fo
Belgium using the daily deaths from 2009-2019 results in 153.4 somewhat lower than the values
in Table 1.
5

Table 2 gives the number of excess deaths per million of population for the three countries
and the three age groups using the baselines of Table 1. In Germany for the weeks 11-23 there
were 378 excess deaths per million for the whole population based on the quantile baseline. The
number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths is about 9000 or 108 per million of the population. This
leaves 270 excess deaths per million of the population. How many of these may be put down to
the Covid-19 epidemic depends on the intensity o the influenza epidemic of the winter 2019-2020
and how quickly it declines.

Z-scores and P-scores
Z-scores

Given data X n = (X1 , . . . , Xn ) with mean X̄ n we model the data as i.i.d. N (µ + δ, σ 2 ) with
known µ and σ. We require a confidence interval for δ. The Z-score is
Zsc =

√

n(X̄ n − µ)/σ

√
and as X̄ n = µ + δ + Zσ/ n with Z = N (0, 1) we have
Zsc =

√

√
√
n(µ + δ + Zσ/ n − µ)/σ = nδ/σ + Z

which gives
√
√
δ = σZsc / n − σZ/ n.
Thus with probability 0.95
√
√
|δ − σZsc / n| ≤ 1.96σ/ n.
One notes that the Z-score is divided by

√

n.
6

We now consider the case where X satisfies a Poisson distribution with mean λ(1 + δ) with
known λ. Again a confidence interval is required for δ. The Z-score is
√
Zsc = (X − λ)/ λ.
Now
p
(X − λ(1 + δ))/ λ(1 + δ) ≈ N (0, 1)
for large λ. For example for λ = 300 the Kolmogorov distance between distribution functions of
√
(X − λ)/ λ and N (0, 1) is less than 0.01. Thus we may write
X = λ(1 + δ)) + Z

p
λ(1 + δ)

with Z ≈ N (0, 1) and hence
Zsc = (λδ + Z
so that

p

√
δ : |δ − 72Zsc / n| ≤ 141σ (1 + δ)/n
Without knowledge of n and σ no information about δ can be obtained simply from the Z-score.
The Z-scores published by Euromomo are more complicated than this although exactly how they
are calculated is not known. Whatever the case they are simply misleading and consequently
worthless.

3.2

P-scores

We define the P-score for the ith week as (x(i) − bsln(i)/bslin(i) where x(i) is the number of
deaths and bsln(i) the value of the baseline for that week (see [Aron and Muellbauer, 2020]). In
contrast to the Z-scores the P-scores do not depend on the size of the population. The P-scores for
the three countries and three age groups considered here are shown in Figure 6.

Models

In his book [Huber, 2011] Peter Huber points out that the word ‘model’ has ‘a bewilderingly wide
semantic range’ but with a common feature
a model is a representation of the essential aspects of some real thing in an idealized,
exemplary form, ignoring the inessential ones.
EuroMOMO aims
to detect and measure excess deaths related to seasonal influenza, pandemics and other
public health threats.
Given this it is strange that EuroMOMO should choose the Poisson model which, with a single parameter, is too simple to enable EuroMOMO to accomplish its aims. Because of this EuroMOMO
has to perform several operations on the original data before calculating the Z-scores:
Z-score(s) are computed on the de-trended and de-seasonalized series, after a 2/3 powers
transformation according to the method described in Farrington et al. 1996. This enables
the computation of Z-scores for series that are originally Poisson distributed.
The aims and the calculation of the Z-scores seem to contradict each other. If you want to measure
excess deaths including seasonal data it seems contra-productive to de-trend and de-seasonalize.
The 2/3 powers transformations of [Farrington et al., 1996] are to take into account the asymmetry
of the Poisson distribution when calculating Z-values. The smallest value of λ for the 24 countries
considered by EuroMOMO is about 350 for Northern Ireland. The maximum difference between
the cumulative distribution functions of the Po(350) and its normal approximation is about 0.014
so it hardly seems worthwhile making this correction. Moreover you can calculate the Z-score
exactly without the normal approximation. Suppose the data are x and the model is Po(λ). The
P-value for x is p = P λ (X ≥ x) which can be calculated using any statistical software. The
corresponding Z-score for x is z = Φ−1 (1 − p) where Φ is the distribution N (0, 1) distribution
function.
Even all this is not sufficient. There is over dispersion which must be estimated, also local
trends, restriction to spring and autumn months: see
https://www.euromomo.eu/how-it-works/methods/
Excess deaths due to influenza, pandemics, heat-waves and other public health threats manifest
themselves in the data as peaks in the data: see Figure 8 which gives the number of daily deaths
8

in Germany from 01.01.2016-26.04.2020. A sharp peak in July 2019 is clearly visible caused by
temperatures of around 40C. Thus the aims of EuroMOMO stated above can be translated into
the statistical problem of estimating peaks in a set of data. This is a problem in shape constrained
non-parametric regression. We discuss it in the next section.

5.1

Epidemics and Peaks
Taut string

Epidemics are peaks in the mortality data. Of interest could be the number of peaks, their beginning and end, their heights and locations, and their power. The same problem occurs in X-Ray
diffractograms and was treated in [Davies et al., 2008]. The approach given here is a simplified
version of that paper. It is based on the so called ‘taut string’ algorithm of [Davies and Kovac, 2001].
The expression ‘taut string’ is taken from [Barlow et al., 1972].
Three properties of the taut string are here of interest. Firstly, it is very fast requiring about
0.3 seconds for the England and Wales daily data from 1970 to 2014 of size 16346. Secondly,
it minimizes the number of local extremes subject to multiresolution conditions on the residuals.
Thirdly, the version used here minimizes the sum of squared residuals between a local minimum
and the next local maximum subject to the function being non-decreasing with the corresponding
property between a local maximum and the next local minimum. This is known as isotone regression, see [Barlow et al., 1972], but here with the extra property that the minimum and maximum
values are given by the taut string. In particular it minimizes the sum of squared residuals subject
to the shape constraints satisfied by the taut string. The resulting residuals will give a very good
estimate of the random variability of the data.
The top panel of Figure 7 shows the Belgian daily data from 2009-2019 together with the taut
string regressing function. The centre panel shows the residuals and the bottom panel a Poisson
process with the taut string as the parameter. The taut string is piecewise constant as is isotonic
regression. The location of local minima and maxima is taken to be the midpoint of the interval
defining this local extreme value. For the Belgian data these are
203, 393, 499, 549, 593, 725, 880, 909, 954, 1145, 1275, 1304,1316
1509, 1698, 1863, 2049, 2230, 2348, 2375, 2417, 2639, 2741, 2795, 2812
2954, 3085, 3095, 3148, 3350,3465, 3500, 3552, 3683, 3833, 3858, 3895
starting with a local minimum at day 203.
It seems more consistent to take the start of an epidemic not as the midpoint but as the right
endpoint of a local minimum interval. Similarly the end of an epidemic is the left endpoint. Thus
9

the first influenza epidemic starts at about day 215 with about 262 deaths a day, peaks at day 393
with about 320 deaths per day and finishes on about day 454 with about 274 deaths per day. These
values are taken from the taut string. It lasted for about 239 days and the total number of deaths in
this period was 69619.
The residuals shown in the centre panel of Figure 7 have a standard deviation of 20.66. The
Poisson reconstruction has one of 17.23 giving an over dispersion of 20% when compared with the
Poisson process. This has been noted before (see [Aron and Muellbauer, 2020]) but not quantified.
It is just about visible to the eye when one compares the top and bottom panels of Figure 7. If
one repeats this for the daily data for Germany from 2016-2019 the taut string residuals have a
standard deviation of 90.6 whereas the Poisson model based on the taut string one of 54.8. The
over dispersion is about 65%. For England and Wales daily data exists for the years 2011-2014.
The over dispersion is calculated as 25%.
The residuals look random but may still contain some residual structure not removed by the
taut string. To examine this we consider periodicities and lags. The data length is 4017. We now
generate sine and cosine functions
sin(πj(1 : n)/n), cos(πj(1 : n)/n), j = 1, . . . , n/2
with n = 4017, regard these as covariates and use the Gaussian selection procedure ([Davies and Dümbgen, 2020])
to select covariates. A cut-off P-value of 0.01 resulted four functions being selected. Three had
periodicities of almost exactly seven days with a smallest P-value 1.1e-61. The fourth had a period
of 365 days and a P-value 4.4e-07. In the case of lags we allowed for lags of up to 500 days. With
a cut-off P-value of 0.01 10 lags were selected. As was to be expected the lag of order one was
dominant with a P-value 1.3e-21. The P-values of the remaining nine all exceeded 2.0e-07.

5.2

Smoothing the taut string

The main disadvantage of the taut string method is that the resulting function is piecewise constant. To obtain smoother functions, that is one which are differentiable, is considerably more
difficult as determining a derivative is an ill-posed problem. Some form of regularization is required. We do this by minimizing the total variation of the derivative subject to the multiscale and
the monotonicity constraints of the taut string. This is accomplished here by solving a linear programming problem which causes a large increase in computing time; [Kovac, 2007] has a much
faster but less stable version. The upper panel of Figure 9 shows the result of minimizing the total
variation of the first derivative, the lower panel that for the second derivative. The first function
is piecewise linear, the second piecewise quadratic.The computing times were about ten minutes.
10

The standard deviations of the residuals were respectively 106 and 106.5, much larger than the
standard deviation of the taut string residuals.
