Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Oceans
The novel corona virus (COVID-19) has slowed down a lot of human activities in the world.
A lockdown resulting in the closure of largest industries in the world for a period of 2 months,
due to the pandemic, was enough to cause a drop of 7% of the anthropogonic CO2 in the
atmosphere. In addition to the world in general, the excess of the anthropogonic CO2
emission in the atmosphere has always been a threat to the oceans as well. Oceans play a key
role to buffer the greenhouse effect, but in the process, it becomes warmer, more acidic, and
less oxygenated. While there have already been investigations done on the effect of pandemic
on atmosphere, the question what happens to oceans during the pandemic remains
unanswered. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of the pandemic and the resultant
reduction in CO2 emissions on the productivity of the global oceans. Often Chlorophyll-a
(Chl-a), Particulate organic and inorganic carbon (PIC: POC), and sea surface temperature
(SST), are used to indicate the productivity of oceans. Herein, satellite-derived estimates of
the aforementioned parameters are used. Based on these estimates, a drop in Chl-a (≥0.5
mg.m-3) is observed off Alaska, North Europe, South China and Southeast USA during the
pandemic. CO2 reduction of 123 metric ton of CO2 (MtCO2) during the pandemic in China
might have caused reduction in mean Chl-a by around 5% (2.5 to 1.6 mg.m-3). Reduction of
Chl-a during the pandemic is mostly associated with the reduction of PIC:POC. The
pandemic demonstrates noticeable effect on Chl-a and/or SST. A cooling response of 0.5 oC
in mean SST is observed over most of the coastal areas, especially off Alaska, north Indian
ocean, and eastern Pacific. The decrease in the CO2 emissions in India by 30% during the
pandemic translates into a drop of mean SST in the north Indian ocean by 5% (from 29.95
to 28.46 oC). All these suggest that maintaining global activities as sustainable as the
pandemic period, can help to recover the oceans.

1. Introduction
Since the pandemic has erupted there have been a lot of discussions about the effect of pandemic
on the environment, pollution, economy, employment and what not. But, what about the oceans?

2

Oceans are the largest source of food, with more than 40% of the world's population relying on the
oceans as their primary source (UN SDG 2016). Oceans are also important in regulating the global
climate in terms of balancing the temperature of earth (Morel and Antoine 1994), simulating the
rainfall (Goddard and Graham 1999) and providing 50-80% of the oxygen in earth (NOAA 2020).
Therefore, any change on the surface of the ocean has a direct effect on the life on the earth.
As the pandemic has shown a pronounced effect on the environment in general (ZambranoMonserrate, Ruano, and Sanchez-Alcalde 2020), it is imperative to study its effect on oceans. The
characteristic of the oceans, which directly influence the life on the earth is their productivity.
Productivity represents the health of the marine ecosystem and the carbon cycle (Behrenfeld et al.
2005). Productivity is commonly estimated as the plant biomass in the ocean and Chlorophyll-a
(Chl-a) is one of the key metric indicators for it (Morin, Lamoureux, and Busnarda 1999). Ocean
productivity is associated with the sea temperature (Behrenfeld et al. 2006; Gerecht et al. 2014)
and the carbon cycle. The carbon cycle is affected by two main carbon processes including the
production of particulate organic carbon (POC) during biomass photosynthesis and the formation
of carbonate shells (PIC) during biomineralization (Gehlen et al. 2006). The latter is an important
element of global ocean carbon, which consists of calcium carbonate shells. These shells partially
dissolve in the oceans and what remain deposit on the seafloor of oceans (Mitchell et al. 2017).
The COVID-19 pandemic has slowed down a lot of human stressors in the world (Le Quéré et al.
2020). The pandemic erupted in November 2019. However, it has just been over 2 months for the
closure and lockdowns of big industries such as the automobile factories in China (e.g. General
Motors, Honda Motor, Nissan Motor), Europe and

Americas (e.g. General Motors, Ford

Motor)(UN ILO 2020b), textile and clothing factories of the major brands, including Adidas, Gap,
H&M and Inditex (UN ILO 2020c), and the maritime fishing and shipping industry where many

3

fishing vessels are unable to leave port and the demand for many seafood products is substantially
reduced (UN ILO 2020a). All these human stressors have been seriously affecting the ocean in the
past decades until the pandemic has occurred. This effect includes the high sea surface temperature
(SST) (Knutson et al. 2010; Nurhati, Cobb, and Di Lorenzo 2011; Yeh et al. 2009), ocean
acidification (Boyd 2011; Ekstrom et al. 2015; Wittmann and Pörtner 2013) and increasing
ultraviolet radiation (Williamson et al. 2014). With continued business-as-usual emissions, SST is
projected to increase 0.035 °C per year and warm an additional 2.8 °C by 2100 (Bruno et al. 2018).
There is no answer to the question whether or not the pandemic has helped in reducing the
cumulative human impact on the oceans through the reduction of 7% in the global CO2 emissions
(Le Quéré et al. 2020).
This study is dedicated to answer this question and to study the pandemic’s effect on other parts
of our world. The analysis done herein is based on the ocean’s data retrieved from the satellite
images during the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods. The changes of the Chl-a, SST, PIC:POC
are addressed during these periods in global and regional perspectives.
2. Results
In this analysis, the daily level-3 ocean data retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used. The data were obtained with a resolution of 9-km for the
period between 6th of April and 15th of Jun (2019 and 2020). This period has been selected to study
the changes of the surface properties of the oceans during the pandemic of 2020 compared to those
of the 2019 to provide a quantitative measure of relative change compared to pre-COVID
conditions.

4

To particularly study the changes of the global ocean productivity during the pandemic, this work
is focusing on analyzing the changes of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a: mg.m-3) and sea surface temperature
(SST: oC) retrieved from MODIS (Polovina, Howell, and Abecassis 2008; Saba et al. 2010; Roxy
et al. 2016; Goes et al. 2000). Whereas, changes of the ratio of MODIS PIC (mg.m-3) to POC (
mg.m-3) are used to study the changes in the carbon fluxes (Balch et al. 2007; Lipsen et al. 2007;
Findlay, Calosi, and Crawfurd 2011). The difference of ten-day average of MODIS Chl-a, SST,
PIC:POC maps have been calculated to analyze the global changes of ocean productivity and
carbon fluxes for May and Jun during the pandemic and pre- pandemic periods. In addition, daily
MODIS Chl-a, SST, PIC:POC are used to analyze the time series of these parameters during the
period between 6th of April and 15th of Jun in both the pre-pandemic period (2019) and the
pandemic period (2020). These time series data are obtained for 11 regions: Alaska, Northeast
United States (USA), Southeast USA, Pacific Ocean, Southeast America, China & South Korea,
Middle East, North Europe, Northwest Africa, Southwest Africa and Southeast Australia. These
regions are selected because of the presence of either high industrial activities (UNIDO 2019) or
large population (WHO 2016). The pandemic effect, if any, is expected to be obvious in these
intense industrial and/or highly populated areas. Therefore, to understand the pandemic effect on
the productivity of oceans analysis has been performed in global and regional perspectives.
Global Productivity Changes
The global Chl-a concentrations of 2020 are subtracted from those of the 2019 as shown in Figure
1a. Based on this difference in Chl-a (2020-2019), there is mostly a drop of Chl-a in the northeast
USA in 2020 compared to 2019 during May and Jun. The drop of Chl-a has been also observed in
the north Europe in 2020 compared to 2019, especially during May. There is also a drop of more
than 2 mg.m-3 in southeast America, along the Argentine basin which always experience high Chl-

5

a concentrations due to the high surface eddy kinetic energy that brings up the nutrients in the
mixed layer (Richardson, Weatherly, and Gardner 1993). The drop of Chl-a can be also observed
in the south coasts of China. This drop of Chl-a could be very much caused by the reduction of the
CO2 emissions during the pandemic period (Denman 2008). Because phytoplankton biomass takes
up the atmospheric CO2 through the photosynthetic primary production for their growth.
Therefore, as seen here, the reported CO2 reduction of 123 metric ton of CO2 (MtCO2) during the
pandemic (Le Quéré et al. 2020) in China has caused reduction in the mean Chl-a by around 5%
(from 2.5 to 1.6 mg.m-3).
The reduction in atmospheric CO2 emissions during the lockdowns have also affected the carbon
cycle in the ocean based on the changes observed in the ratio of PIC:POC as evident in Figure 1b.
The ratio of PIC to POC (PIC:POC) is well representing the carbon cycle and the pumping of
carbon in to the deep oceans. Because the CO2 consumed during photosynthetic primary
production is converted to the organic molecules with some species also forming CaCO3 called
PIC. All these particulate ecosystem carbon, living and dead, is grouped together as POC plus PIC
(Denman 2008). Therefore a decrease in PIC:POC indicates a reduction in CO2 uptake. The
changes of PIC:POC is observed based on the subtraction of PIC:POC values of 2020 from those
of the 2019 during both May and Jun (Figure 1b). As shown in these maps, generally, there is a
reduction of PIC:POC off the global coasts. For example, there is a reduction of around 0.5 (0.60.14) in PIC:POC off Europe during Jun. This means that the reported reduction of atmospheric
CO2 emissions by 24% (Le Quéré et al. 2020) during the pandemic in Europe can cause a direct
decrease of PIC:POC by 75%.
The reduction in CO2 emission caused by the pandemic has also caused a cooling response of 0.5
o

C in SST over most of the coastal areas, especially off Alaska, north Indian ocean, and eastern

Pacific as shown in the figure of SST difference between 2020 and 2019, Figure 1c. These regions
have been reported to have high warming trend previously caused by climate change (Reid et al.
2010). This can explain their fast response to the reduction in CO 2 emissions. The decrease in the
CO2 emissions in India by 30% during the pandemic might have caused a drop of SST in the north

7

Indian ocean by 5 % (29.95-28.46 oC) during the month of Jun of 2020. By comparing the SST
and Chl-a maps, a reduction trend in SST and an increase of Chl-a is observed. This is because the
reduction in SST can improve the uptake of the atmospheric CO2 by the ocean and can enhance
the photosynthesis process. Therefore, the reduction in CO2 emissions doesn’t have a direct effect
on Chl-a and SST, rather it is related with both of them.
Regional Productivity Changes
Based on the aforementioned analysis of the pandemic effect on the global oceans, 11 regions have
been identified to be more critical than others as per the effect of pandemic. Therefore, the daily
time series of Chl-a, PIC:POC, and SST have been obtained for these 11 regions starting from 6th
of April until 15th of Jun for 2019 and 2020.
Daily time series data suggest that there is a general decrease of Chl-a during the pandemic in most
of the regions especially in China & South Korea, southeast America, Pacific Ocean, Southwest
Africa, Alaska, and Middle East compared to 2019 as shown in Figures 2a-2f. For example, the
mean Chl-a concentrations along Southwest Africa have dropped during the pandemic period of
Jun from 2.5 mg.m-3 to 2 mg.m-3 compared to Jun 2019 (Figure 2d). Likewise, there is a prominent
drop of Chl-a from 3 mg.m-3 to 2.5 mg.m-3 during the pandemic period off Alaska region as shown
in Figure 2e. A reduction of 9% (from 2.2 to 1.07 mg.mg -3) in Chl-a is observed in the Middle
East (Arabian Gulf) as evident in Figure 2f. In addition, in the Southeast America, for example, on
28th of May, Chl-a decreased by 3 mg.m-3 in 2020 compared to 2019 (Figure 2b). The drop of Chla has reached up to 50% during the pandemic in Alaska, Southeast America, Pacific Ocean, and
Southwest Africa. In some of the regions, the reduction in CO2 emissions have reduced the degree
of Chl-a fluctuations in 2020 compared to 2019. For example, in Southwest America, North
Europe, and Pacific Ocean the maximum peaks have dropped during the pandemic by 28%, 40%

and 12%, respectively as shown in Figures 2g, 2c,2i. The reduction in Chl-a has not been observed
in Southeast Australia Figure 2h. This could mean that either the productivity in this region has
not been affected by the pandemic or the significant drop of SST improved the uptake of CO2 and
caused the increase in Chl-a and PIC:POC in this region.
The aforementioned reduction of Chl-a (50%) during the pandemic is mostly associated with
reduction of PIC:POC, which has reached up to 60%. This drop of PIC:POC is observed in most
of the regions during the pandemic as evident in Figure xxx. For example, a drop of PIC:POC is
observed in Alaska in 2020 for the entire pandemic period. Similarly the reduction of PIC:POC is
observed in North Europe in 2020 where PIC:POC doesn’t exceed 0.5. There is a prominent
reduction in PIC:POC in the northwest Africa with a maximum of 80% in Jun 2020 compared to
that of 2019 (Figure 2i). There is also a general reduction of PIC:POC in China & South Korea,
which reflect the effect of the CO2 reduction (Figure 2a). In some periods, PIC:POC values are
found to be more correlated with SST than those of Chl-a. For example, in the southwest Africa,
PIC:POC has decreased in the end of April by 60% during the pandemic period of 2020 compared
to 2019. This reduction in PIC:POC is correlated with the increase in SST. Likewise, a drop of
PIC:POC is observed in the Pacific Ocean during the early pandemic period, April 2020 as shown
in Figure 2c. But, later during Jun 2020 PIC:POC values are found to be more than those of 2019
due to a decrease in SST.
The reduction in CO2 emissions has also caused a noticeable drop in SST especially in Alaska,
Northeast USA, and Middle East as in Figures 2e,2j,2f. For example, although the general trend
of SST in Alaska during the pandemic and pre-pandemic period are similar to each other, the SST
during the pandemic year (2020) is found to be slightly lower (by ~0.3 oC) than that of the previous
year (2019). In the Southeast of USA, SST shows lower values during the pandemic period

10

compared to the previous year (Figure 2k). Similar drop of SST occurs in China and South Korea
in the pandemic period especially in the middle of May and beginning of Jun. The drop of SST in
the Middle East is prominent in Jun 2020 compared to that of 2019.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced in a 7% reduction of the anthropogenic CO2
emissions in the world. Herein, effect of CO2 reductions on productivity of oceans has been studied
in terms of analyzing the changes of Chl-a, PIC:POC and SST during the pandemic and prepandemic periods. The results show a reduction in Chl-a concentrations in the global oceans
especially in the coastal regions. For example, there is a prominent decrease in Chl-a off Alaska,
North Europe, South China and Southeast USA. The drop of mean Chl-a by 5% in South China
correspond to reduction of 123 MtCO2 in CO2 emissions during the pandemic. The aforementioned
reduction of Chl-a during the pandemic is mostly associated with reduction of PIC:POC (by 60%).
The reduction in CO2 emissions has also caused a drop in SST in Alaska, Northeast USA,
Southeast USA and Middle East. The results suggest that a 7% reduction of CO2 emissions within
2 months of lockdown period could reserve the oceans and maintaining similar sustainable
practices could highly decrease the climate change affect on oceans.
