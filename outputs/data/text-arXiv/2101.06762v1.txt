Abstract
Since March 2020, companies nationwide have started work
from home (WFH) due to the rapid increase of COVID-19
confirmed cases in an attempt to help prevent the coronavirus
from spreading and rescue the economy from the pandemic.
Many organizations have conducted surveys to understand
people’s opinions towards WFH. However, due to the limited
sample size in surveys and the dynamic topics over time, we
instead conduct a large-scale social media study using Twitter
data to portrait different groups who have positive/negative
opinions about WFH. We perform an ordinary least square regression to investigate the relationship between the sentiment
about WFH and user characteristics including gender, age,
ethnicity, median household income, and population density.
To better understand public opinion, we use latent Dirichlet
allocation to extract topics and discover how tweet contents
relate to people’s attitude. These findings provide evidence
that sentiment about WFH varies across user characteristics.
Furthermore, content analysis sheds light on the nuanced differences of sentiment and reveal disparities relate to WFH.

Introduction
COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus, first reported in
China and then spread to the whole world, has caused 22.3
million confirmed cases and more than 373 thousand deaths
in the United States by January 11, 20211 . To help prevent
the virus from spreading and also salvage the economy, companies and schools nationwide have started work/study from
home. According to a Gartner survey of 880 global HR executives on March 17, 2020 2 , almost 88% organizations have
encouraged or required employees to work from home. Barrero, Bloom, and Davis (2020) have found that working from
home might stick even after the pandemic ends. Concerns
may arise when it comes to productivity (Feng and Savani
2020), willingness (Palumbo 2020), and future trends (Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 2020; Chung et al. 2020) regarding
work/study from home.
In this study, we intend to understand public opinions on
work from home using large-scale social media data. Twitter has been a platform for people, especially in the United
States, to express their feelings about what is happening

around them. In contrast, the Boston Consulting Group used
survey data to study employees’ opinions regarding COVID19 work from home (Dahik et al. 2020). However, Twitter
data allows an opportunity for conducting a more timely
study on a larger scale. We acquire the data with an authorized Twitter developer account using Tweepy, a Python library for accessing the Twitter API. This ensures the reliability by acquiring first-hand and sufficient data when conducting the research.
In this paper, we also infer user demographic information
using Twitter user information. This is of importance since
we can deep dive into the characteristics of those who are
more pro-WFH. For example, when we look into gender, we
understand that historically mothers have been mostly responsible for caring children (Thistle 2006). Therefore, we
need the gender information to check if there is any difference in sentiment towards working from home between female and male, as working from home would allow female
employees to allocate more time accompanying their children.
Our goal is to understand the U.S. public opinions on
working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we focus on the following research questions:
• RQ1: Who are more likely to tweet about working from
home?
• RQ2: How does the sentiment of working from home vary
across user demographics?
• RQ3: When discussing working from home, what do
Twitter users mainly talk about? How does the content
correlate with the sentiment of working from home?
To summarize, in a large-scale dataset of publicly available Twitter posts concerning working from home ranging
from April 10, 2020 to April 22, 2020, we find that females
and older people are more likely to tweet about working
from home. After performing the ordinary least square regression, we confirm that sentiment of working from home
vary across user characteristics. In particular, females tend to
be more positive about working from home. People in their
30s are more positive towards WFH than other age groups.
People from urban areas are more pro-WFH. High-income
people are more likely to have positive opinions about working from home.

These nuanced differences are supported by a more finegrained topic analysis. At a higher level, we find that negative sentiment about WFH roughly corresponds to the discussion of unemployment issues. However, people express
more positive sentiment when talking about WFH experience. Furthermore, topic distributions vary across different
user groups.

Related Work
Working from home has been a controversial issue which
merits a closer look. An investigation shows that WFH might
incur side-effect such as a negative impact on work-life balance (Palumbo 2020). This would lead to negative opinions
towards WFH when people tweet about it. Other research
deep dive into specific categories. A survey of Lithuania’s
employees shows that female employees appreciate more
than male employees, because the female can enjoy a healthier lifestyle while male employees worry about career constraints (Raišienė et al. 2020). However, another survey conducted in the United States shows “a gender gap in perceived
work productivity”: Before WFH, female and male employees report the same level of self-rated work productivity.
After shifting to WFH, males perform with better productivity than the female employees (Feng and Savani 2020).
As for age, people in their 40s have more negative opinions
on WFH because the unfamiliarity with teleworking. People aged 30-39 have the most positive opinions because they
can enjoy time with family and they are already used to new
technologies for teleworking (Raišienė et al. 2020). Previous
studies (Raišienė et al. 2020; Bick, Blandin, and Mertens
2020; Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 2020) also show that opinions concerning working from home vary across different
socioeconomic groups. A similar social media study of public sentiment on working from home has been conducted in
the U.K. (Carroll, Mostafa, and Thorne 2020). Results show
that in the U.K., more than 70% tweets concerning working from home have positive sentiment and the main topics
include traffic, drink and e-Commerce.
Similar approaches have been implemented by researchers mining Twitter posts with natural language processing on their attitudes on face masks (Yeung, Lai, and
Luo 2020), using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) model (Hutto and Gilbert 2014)
to perform sentiment analysis. Moreover, Twitter data have
been used to study many different aspects of COVID-19,
such as mining overall public perception towards COVID19 (Boon-Itt and Skunkan 2020), college students’ attitudes
on the pandemic (Duong et al. 2020), people’s attitude on
potential COVID-19 vaccines (Lyu et al. 2020), pregnant
women sentiment analysis during quarantine (Talbot, Charron, and Konkle 2021), as well as monitoring depression
trend on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic (Zhang
et al. 2020). They all use VADER for sentiment analysis and
most of them include time series analysis. In addition, we
follow the practice of using LDA, as known as the Latent
Dirichlet analysis (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003), to identify
topics among large text corpus. The M3-inference Model is
used by Yeung, Lai, and Luo (2020) and Zhang et al. (2020)
to portrait different demographic groups.

Methods
In this section, we summarize the data collection process
and the methods we apply in the analyses. To address RQ1
and RQ2, we discuss how we infer user characteristics and
the sentiment in Feature Inference. To investigate RQ3, we
describe how we extract the topics of tweets in Topic Modeling.

Data Collection
We collect related English tweets through Tweepy stream
API using keywords and hashtags filtering. The filter
keywords and hashtags are “WFH”, “workfromhome”,
“work from home”, “layoff”, “furlough”, “jobless”, “#wfh”,
“#workingfromhome”. 1,906,416 unique tweets with 23 attributes posted by 1,119,251 unique Twitter users ranging
from April 5, 2020 to April 26, 2020 are collected. We attempt to infer the gender, age, ethnicity of the Twitter users,
extract the population density of the location, and estimate
the sentiment of the tweets. In the end, 58,345 unique Twitter users with all features are included in the dataset.

Feature Inference
Sentiment. A normalized, weighted composite score is
calculated for each tweet using VADER (Valence Aware
Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) (Hutto and Gilbert
2014) to measure the sentiment. The score ranges from -1
(most negative) to +1 (most positive). Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the sentiment score.

Age and gender. We apply the M3-inference
model (Wang et al. 2019) to infer the gender and age
of each Twitter user using profile name, user name (screen
name), and profile description. Age is binned into four
groups: ≤ 18, 19 − 29, 30 − 29, ≥ 40. The gender
distribution of Twitter users is biased on males around
71.8% (Burger et al. 2011). A similar pattern is also
observed in our dataset, where 60.2% are male, and 39.8%
are female. With respect to age, 40.5% of the users in our
dataset are older than 40 years old, 35.0% are between 30 to
39 years old, 15.4% are between 19 to 29 years old, and the
rest are younger than 19 years old.
Ethnicity. To estimate the ethnicity of the Twitter users,
we apply the Ethnicolr API3 which makes inference based
on the last name and first name or just the last name of the
Twitter user (Sood and Laohaprapanon 2018). In our work,

Population density. USzipcode SearchEngine is applied
to extract the population density of each user’s location that
is self-reported by the Twitter user in the profile information.
The population density is categorized into urban (greater
than 3,000), suburban (1,000-3,000) and rural (lower than
1,000). In the end, 63.6% are urban, 15.5% are suburban and
the rest are rural. The majority of the users of our dataset are
from urban area which is consistent with the fact that 83%
of U.S. population lived in urban area (urb 2020), however,
there are proportionally fewer urban users in our dataset than
in the U.S. population.
Income. To understand the relationship between people’s
attitude towards working from home and the gap between
rich and poor at users’ locations, we retrieve regional median
income from 2019 American Community Survey (ACS).
Census Application Programming Interface (API) tools are
used to extract median income with an input of city-level
user location. The descriptive statistics are shown in Table 2.

Topic Modeling
We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei, Ng, and Jordan
2003) to extract topics from the tweets. In our study, we use
the stop words package from NLTK library, extended with
topic related words (e.g., “work”, “home”). To extract the
most relevant topics, we only collect nouns, verbs, adjectives
and adverbs lemmas. We tune the hyperparameters by nested
looping topic numbers, α and β. In the end, we choose
num topics=10, alpha=”asymmetric”, eta=0.31, with a coherence score Cv = 0.372.

Sentiment Analysis
In the previous section, we find that when referring to working from home, Twitter users are slightly positive. In this
section, we attempt to investigate the relationship between
user characteristics and the sentiment of discussions about
working from home. We perform an ordinary least square
regression on the dataset (n = 58, 345). Descriptive statistics and bi-variate correlations are shown in Table 3. Table 4
summarizes the result of the ordinary least squares regression.
Females tend to be more positive about working from
home. Males are significantly more negative about working
from home than females (B = −0.03, SE = 0.00, p <
.001, 95%CI = [−0.04, −0.02]). The average sentiment
score of males/females is shown in Figure 1. This is
consistent with the remote work survey report by Fast
Company (TENNEN–ZAPIER 2020). A more positive
sentiment observed in females could be due to the change
in working styles (TENNEN–ZAPIER 2020) and fewer
work hours compared to male (Collins et al. 2020). Previous
survey indicates that females favor WFH from a healthier
lifestyle perspective (Raišienė et al. 2020).

we remove emoji icons, hyphens, unrelated contents and
special characters to extract the last names and apply “census ln” to infer the ethnicity which contains White, Black
or African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Hispanic.
In our dataset, White is predominant over other categories with 83.4%, while according to the U.S. Census Bureau (U.S. Census Bureau 2019), White constitutes 60.1% of
the U.S. population; 7.0% are Asian/Pacific Islander, while
Asian/Pacific Islander constitutes 6.1% in the United States;
6.8% are Hispanic, while 18.5% of the U.S. population
are Hispanic; 2.6% are Black or African American, while
13.4% of the U.S. population are Black or African American; American Indian/Alaska Native only constitutes 0.3%.
Interestingly, the percentages of White and Asian/Pacific Islander are much higher than those in the general population, which could be related to the labor force distributions
of these two groups. In 2018, 54% of employed Asian and
41% of employed White, compared with 31% of employed
Black or African American and 22% of employed Hispanic
worked in management, professional, and related occupations (STATISTICS, US BUREAU OF LABOR 2019a) that
can be most likely done at home (Dingel and Neiman 2020).
Therefore, it is not surprising that there are more White and
Asian/Pacific Islander in our dataset due to the disparities in
the occupations.

Barrero, Bloom, and Davis (2020) that high-income workers, especially, enjoy the perks of working from home.
We conduct an ordinary least square regression to investigate the relationship between the user characteristics and
the sentiment referring to working from home. Our findings
confirm the predictive effects of the user characteristics on
the sentiment. Females tend to be more positive about working from home. People in their 30s are more positive. People
from urban areas are more pro-WFH. High-income people
tend to be more pro-WFH. As for ethnicity, there is no sufficient evidence to conclude that the sentiment varies across
ethnicity groups according to our dataset.

Topic Analysis

Figure 2: Average sentiment scores of age groups.

People from urban areas are more pro-WFH than
those from suburban areas and those from rural areas.
Compared to people from rural areas, we do not find sufficient evidence to conclude that people from the suburban
areas are more positive about working from home, but
people from urban areas are significantly more positive
(B = 0.02, SE = 0.01, p < .001, 95%CI = [0.01, 0.03]).
The average sentiment scores of urban/suburban/rural are
shown in Figure 3. This would make sense because people
from the populated area would be more worried about
working on-site, since there were more cases in the urban
areas than suburban and rural areas (Duca et al. 2020).
Moreover, large company especially the ones in urban areas
have technical support for working from home and remote
job positions (Bach 2020).
People from higher-income areas are more likely to have
pro-WFH opinions than the people from lower-income
areas. Income is significantly correlated with the sentiment
about working from home (B = 0.14, SE = 0.03, p <
.001, 95%CI = [0.09, 0.19]). This aligns with our findings
from people from urban areas would be more pro-WFH,
since the regional median income would is higher in big
cities (Duffin 2020). This is also in line with the findings of

Next, we attempt to capture what Twitter users mainly talk
about when they refer to working from home. More specifically, we investigate how the contents correlate with the sentiment of working from home. Table 5 shows the 10 topics
extracted by LDA model. We assign each topic a title on the
basis of the top 10 keywords.
Topic 1 (Quarantine) contains the keywords: “pandemic”,
“force” and “stay”, and it constitutes 15.4% of the total
tweets. In April, there were five days that quarantine-related
topics were trended on Twitter daily top 15 topics4 . Topic
2 (COVID) constitutes 15.3% of the total tweets we collect, which is also a large amount, and COVID-related topics
have been trended on Twitter for five days. Topic 3 (Work)
contains the keywords “office” and “business”, most of the
tweets in this topic are about the daily routine of work. Topic
4 (Home) contains the keywords “dress” and “watch”, many
of the tweets in this topic are about sharing life during working, what they are dressing, what movie they are watching at
home, etc. Topic 5 (Government and Trump) contains the
keywords “government”, “trump”, “economy” and “state”.
Government and Trump related topic has been trended on
Twitter top 15 for more than 10 days but many of them are
not related to our study, thus there are only 8.9% of the total tweets talking about this topic. Topic 6 (Remote) con4

the tweets in this topic are about their new remote working setup, such as desk space, speakers and chairs. Topic 7
(WFH Experience) is summarized on the keywords ”happy”,
“free” and “new”, tweets of this topic are mainly about
how people think about working from home, such as feeling happy about the new work style. Topic 8 (Health Care)

Figure 4: Topic distributions.

Figure 5 shows the average sentiment score of each topic.
The average sentiment score of Topic 7 (WFH Experience)
is the highest (0.370), considered as the most positive topic,
compared with Topic 9 (Unemployment), the most negative
topic (-0.064). In addition, a decent high sentiment score is
observed in Topic 6 (Remote) and Topic 8 (Health Care),
while the average sentiment score of Topic 5 (Government
and Trump) is much lower compared to other topics.

Unemployment was a big issue in April. In our study, we
notice that there are multiple spikes in our time series graph
(Figure 6), and most of them are related to Topic 9 (unemployment). For these downward spikes located on April 11,
April 13, April 16, April 19 and April 23, almost all of them
are related with an increase in the percentage of Topic 9 (Unemployment). In other words, unemployment was a very important topic during this time period (April), which is consistent with the facts that the unemployment rate had a sharp
increase in April, reaching 14.7% (STATISTICS, US BUREAU OF LABOR 2019b).
In addition, comparing the time series of Topic 9 (Unemployment) and Topic 7 (WFH Experience), we find that “unemployment” and “WFH Experience” are in a moderate negative correlation (Figure 7). Most of the time, the percentage
of the tweets talking about “unemployment” goes downward
as the percentage of the tweets talking about “WFH Experience” increases.
Older people tweet more on negative topics. According to the aforementioned discussion, the average sentiment
score rises as the age goes up, but the average sentiment
score falls a little bit when it reaches the Babyboomer’s age.
This is in line with the findings of Raišienė et al. (2020). Fig-

Figure 7: Times series of the percentages of the tweets talking about “Unemployment”/“WFH Experience”.

ure 8 shows the topic distributions of age groups. In >= 40
age group, the percentage of negative topics - “Unemployment” and “Government and Trump” - is 17.5%, which is
significantly higher than that of other age groups, 11.5% in
<= 18 group, 11.0% in 19-29 group, 13.0% in 30-39 group.
As for another slightly negative topic (Home), although the
percentage of the tweets about “Home” is lower than that of
the other age groups, the average sentiment score of “Home”
of >= 40 group is extremely low (-0.111), which is the only
negative score in all age groups (<= 18: 0.05, 19-29: 0.09,
30-39: 0.03). Furthermore, we find, as age increases, people talk less about “General”. There are 31.8% for <= 18
age group, 28.5% for 19-29 age group, 23.5% for 30-39 age
group and only 19.7% for >= 40 age group, which indicates the potential pattern that older people are more likely
to tweet about non-general topics.
Superwomen in WFH. In the previous section, we conclude that females show more positive attitude than males on
working from home. Collins et al. (2020) found that might
be because that females tend to reduce more work hours.
According to the difference between the topic distributions
of males and females, we think that fewer work hours allow
females to spend more time accompanying children and taking care of family. The percentage of the tweets about WFH
experience (Topic 7) of females is higher than that of males.
Many tweets that talk about spending time with the children
during working from home are observed in the set of Topic
7. An example is:

Furthermore, we notice that females are less likely to
tweet about negative topics (i.e., “Unemployment”, “Government and Trump”). As shown in Figure 9, 5.0% and 8.1%
of the tweets by females talk about “Unemployment” and
“Government and Trump”, compared with 5.7% and 9.5%
of the tweets by males. Also, in Topic General, there is a
large gap between males and females. Females have a 0.172
average sentiment score on Topic General, where males only
has 0.090, indicating that females have a much higher sentiment score than males.

Black or African American and Hispanic are more negative about the unemployment. Although we do not find
sufficient evidence to conclude that there is significant difference of the sentiment among different ethnicity groups,
there are slight differences of the sentiment across topics.
The topic distributions of ethnicity groups is shown in Figure 10. For “Unemployment”, the average sentiment scores
of Black or African American (-0.157) and Hispanic (0.114) are the lowest indicating the most negative attitude,
which is in line with the fact that, in April, the unemployment issue was the most serious among Black or African
American and Hispanic. The unemployment rate of Hispanic was 18.9% and that of Black or African American was
16.7%5 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020). The unemployment rates of White and Asian were all near 14 (U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020) and the average sentiment
scores are -0.05 and -0.07, respectively6 .

This study represents a large-scale quantitative analysis of
public opinions on working from home during the COVID19 pandemic. Through the lens of social media, we find that
females and older people are more likely to talk about working from home. After performing the ordinary least square
regression, we find that sentiment of working from home
vary across user characteristics. In particular, females are
more positive about working from home, which could be related to the change of working styles (TENNEN–ZAPIER
2020) and fewer work hours compared to males (Collins
et al. 2020). People in their 30s tend to be more positive
towards working from home, compared with younger people and the people who are older than 40. Gen Z (people at
the point of this report aging from 8-23) are found to be
more pro-office than Millennials (24-39) (Watkins 2020),
and Babyboomers (40+) tend to hold a negative opinion
about working from home because of the unfamiliarity of
remote work. People from urban areas are more pro-WFH,
which could be related to a higher confirmed rate in the more
populated area (Duca et al. 2020) and better support for
working from home (Bach 2020). High-income people are
more likely to have positive opinions about working from

home, which echoes the findings of Barrero, Bloom, and
Davis (2020).
These nuanced differences are supported by a more finegrained topic analysis. At a higher level, we find that negative sentiment about WFH roughly corresponds to the discussion of unemployment issues. However, people express
more positive sentiment when talking about WFH experience. Furthermore, topic distributions vary across different
user groups. Notably, the rising unemployment rate brings
“Unemployment” topic to the public. In April, the unemployment rate has risen 10% compared to March and 11.1%
compared to April 2019. Black or African American and
Hispanic are the most negative groups complaining about
“Unemployment”, which can be related to the higher unemployment rates, compared to White and Asian/Pacific Islander(U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020). Females are
talking less about negative topics and many of them is sharing their good time with there families when talking about
“WFH Experience”, which be one of the reasons why females are more pro-WFH.
Implications. Barrero, Bloom, and Davis (2020) have
found that working from home will even stick after the pandemic ends. It is critical to understand public opinions on
working from home to help improve their experience and
design a more suitable and flexible work policy. Our paper suggests that there are nuanced differences across user
characteristics. Policy-makers of the government and companies could design a more customized work policy to not
only increase the work productivity but also improve the
work satisfaction of their employees. It is also important
to address the disparities related to working from home,
which have been reported among different racial and socioeconomic groups (Chowkwanyun and Reed Jr 2020; Chang
et al. 2020).
Limitations. Our study is focused on the relationship between user characteristics and the sentiment about working
from home. However, the occupation of the user can be included in the future analyses. The work ability varies among
different kinds of jobs (Dingel and Neiman 2020), one potential hypothesis could be that people of difference occupations hold different opinions about working from home, thus
occupations would have an impact on the sentiment.

Conclusion
This paper presents a large-scale social media-based study
on who are more likely to tweet about working from home.
By performing the ordinary least square regression, we show
how the sentiment of working from home varies across user
characteristics. After conducting a content-based analysis,
we dissect what Twitter users mainly talk about and how the
content correlates with the sentiment of working from home.
This paper contributes to a better understanding of public
opinions on working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic and lends itself to making policies both at national
and institution/company levels to improve the overall population’s experience of working from home.
