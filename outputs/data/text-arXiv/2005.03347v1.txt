Abstract:
Objective: Computed Tomography (CT) has an important role to detect lung lesion related to
Covide 19. The purpose of this work is to obtain diagnostic findings of Ultra-Low Dose (ULD)
chest CT image and compare with routine dose chest CT.
Material and Methods: Patients, suspected of Covid 19 infection, were scanned successively
with routine dose, and ULD, with 98% or 94% dose reduction, protocols. Axial images of
routine and ULD chest CT were evaluated objectively by two expert radiologists and
quantitatively by Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and pixel by pixel noise measurement.
Results: It was observed that the ULD and routine dose chest CT images could detect Covid 19
related lung lesions in patients with PCR positive test. Also, SNR and pixel noise values were
comparable in these protocols.
Conclusion: ULD chest CT with 98% dose reduction can be used in non-pandemic situation as a
substitute for chest radiograph for screening and follow up. Routine chest CT protocol can be
replaced by ULD, with 94% dose reduction, to detect patients suspected with Covid 19 at an
early stage and for its follow up.

Advances in knowledge: ULD chest CT with 94% dose reduction is able to detect lung lesions
related to Covid 19. ULD chest CT is a suitable substitute for routine dose chest CT especially in
pediatric, young and pregnant patients suspected with Covid 19.

Introduction:
Since the first report of Covid 19 affliction in December 2019, the epidemic has spread to several
countries affecting tens of millions of people, has caused over hundred thousand deaths and
threatens to spread further in the first phase, with risk of resurgent return in future. As a matter of
public health policy and urgency of treatment, it is important to arrive at a protocol for quick
confirmation at an early stage and also for monitoring the prognosis by repeated tests in future.
Some of the studies have reported that un-enhanced chest CT reveals lung lesions related to Covid
19. Chest CT can thus be considered as an important diagnostic tool, comparable to the Real- Time
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) which is known as a gold standard test to detect new
Coronavirus or Covid 19 affected patients [1,2].
Diagnostics by CT, though known for its precise detection ability has the disadvantage of high
dose of x-ray exposure to the patient, with the risk of creating several stochastic effects includ ing
onset of carcinoma in future. Literature review demonstrated that different types of lung lesions
can be detected in chest x-ray with less than 1 mSv effective dose (more than 90% dose reduction
compare to routine or standard dose), which is very close to both, Posterior-Anterior (PA) and
Lateral chest radiograph, when iterative reconstruction is available. This CT protocol is known as
Ultra-Low Dose or ULDCT. It is shown in this study that the ULDCT chest image, due to its three
dimensional nature, is capable of detecting normal and abnormal structures better than by plain

2

radiograph [3-6]. In resent publication, Dangis A. et al [7] have shown that low dose chest CT with
less than 1 mSv can be used to diagnose lung lesion related to Covid 19 in emergency ward.
In developing countries like ours, prolonged testing process like the PCR are not easily accessible.
Thus chest CT has a valuable role in early detection of lung lesion related to Covid 19. Further,
radiation dose reduction by using ULD chest CT protocols can have important role in radiation
protection of the patient in our hospitals.
In this rapid communication, we particularly examine the importance of ultra-low dose computed
tomography (ULDCT) of the chest, to detect lung lesions related to Covid 19, in its early stage and
follow up. Physical explanations are used to justify the finding of this study.
Materials and methods:
This study was approved by the national ethical committee in biomedical research (ethics ID: 9901-48-22204-196109). Patients with signs of Covid 19 infection (respiratory problem) were told
about the increased radiation dose that they would receive from an additional ULDCT test. They
volunteered themselves for this test and the ULDCT test was performed only after they signed the
consent form. Patients were scanned successively with routine and ULD chest CT protocols,
without patient motion between two scan protocols. The 128-MDCT Philips Ingenuity system was
used to scan the patients. Routine dose protocol uses 120 kVp along with the tube current
modulation to scan the chest of the patients referred to the CT department, being done routinely
by default. Two ULD scanning parameters were used to scan the volunteer patient, first group of
patients were scanned by 98% dose reduction protocol (compare to routine dose) and the second
group was scanned by about 94% dose reduction. In the two ULD chest CT protocols, 80 kVp was
3

selected as the excitation tube voltage, while the tube current time product was fixed at 10 and 25
mAs for the first and second group of patients respectively.
It has to be mentioned that the patients with underlying diseases (such as cancer or cardiovascular
disorders), sever respiratory distress (poor condition) and those who did not agreed to do the ULD
chest CT were excluded from this study.
The other scan parameters such as, slice thickness and intervals (2mm and 5mm), gantry rotation
time (0.4 sec) and so on, were the same in both routine and ULD CT protocols. Routine CT images
(axial and coronal) were reconstructed by the hybrid iterative reconstruction software iDose level
4 while ULD CT images (axial and coronal) were reconstructed by complete iterative
reconstruction IMR (Iterative Model Reconstruction) level 1. Dose indices such as volume CT
dose index (CTDIvol in mGy) and dose length product (DLP in mGy.cm) were recorded for dose
assessment purpose. Effective dose was calculated

by the product of conversion factor

(mSv/mGy.cm) and DLP [8]. Axial and coronal slices were reconstructed with iDose level 4 and
IMR level 1 for routine and ULD CT respectively.
Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) was measured at the air of trachea and descending aorta for routine
and ULD chest CT images. This was done by noting the mean HU values and the standard
deviation in HU, as recoded on the ROI from trachea and aorta without contamination with
neighboring structures. SNR measurement was used as a quantitative method for the evaluation of
image quality.
The images are displayed side by side in a diagnostic monitor (Barco monitor, MDMC- 12133,
Belgium). They were examined independently by two radiologists, each with 15 years’ experience
4

and were blinded to each other’s report. It has to be mentioned that the chest CT images which
were included in this study, were those that showed the patient to be affected by Covid 19, as
confirmed by PCR-test.
Results:
Objective evaluation of the chest CT images in Covid 19 affected patients by two expert
radiologists revealed that both ULD chest CT (98% and 94% dose reductions) protocols can detect
corona virus related lung lesions which were diagnosed in routine dose CT protocol. Figures (1)
and (2) are typical images from two patients for whom PCR test had confirmed Covid 19 infectio n.
Although, figure (1.a) was taken by 98% dose reduction, it was able to detect Atoll sign (reverse
halo sign) as clearly as in routine dose protocol, given in Fig. (1.b) in chest CT images of Covid
19 patients (confirmed by PCR test). It has to be mentioned that the effective dose to this patient
(calculated by the product of 0.014 into DLP) were 6.6 and 0.09 mSv in routine and ultra-low dose
protocols respectively.

FIG. 1. Axial chest CT images show the Atoll sign or reverse halo sign, in a 21 years' female
Covid 19 patient, scanned by (a) routine dose (6.6 mSv effective dose) and (b) ultra-low dose
(98% dose reduction with 0.09 mSv effective dose) protocols.
It can be seen in Fig. 2 (a-d) that the chest CT images of a Covid 19 infected patient, scanned at
routine dose, the effective dose is about 3.7 mSv, (Fig. 2.a and c) and for 94% dose reduction, the
effective dose is about 0.22 mSv, (Fig. 2.b and d). Axial slices of chest CT with ULD (94% reduced
dose) protocol reveals Crazy Paving appearance, although its resolution is less than that of the
routine dose image (Fig. 2.b). Ground glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation which are seen in
routine dose axial CT image (Fig 2.c) of the same patient, can be detected in ULD CT image (Fig.
2.d) with about 94% dose reduction equally clearly by visual discrimination by the radiologist.

FIG.2. Axial chest CT images of 71 year-old female patient infected with Covid 19 (PCR
positive) shows crazy paving pattern in routine dose (a) and 94% dose reduction or ULD (b)
protocols. Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) can be seen in routine dose (c) and ULD (d) protocols.
Effective doses of this patient in routine and ULD (94% dose reduction) protocols were 3.7 mSv
and 0.22 mSv respectively.
Quantitative image quality comparison: The SNR, were calculated for the mean HU and in the
pixel by pixel noise, in blood and air inside the aorta and trachea, were taken for the ULD (with
98% and 94% dose reductions) and routine dose chest CT images. These estimates revealed that
the SNR of the ULD (with 98% and 94% dose reductions) and routine dose chest CT images, are
comparable to each other. SNR and pixel by pixel noise for ULD and routine dose chest CT images
are presented in Table I.

The results of CT dose measurements show that CTDIvol of ULDCT protocols are fixed at 0.2 and
0.5 mGy, and their DLPs are 7.4 (6.4-9.5) mGy.cm and 18.35 (15.6-20.2) mGy.cm for 98% and
94% dose reduction protocols. The mean of CTDIvol and DLP in routine dose chest CT of Covid
19 patients are about 11 (6.6-20) mGy and 400mGy.cm (255-700 mGy.cm) respectively.
Effective dose of routine dose chest CT in Covid 19 affected patients is 5.7 mSv which is 55 and
22 times higher than that of ULD CT protocols with 98% (mean effective dose is equal to 0.1036)
and 94% (mean effective dose is equal to 0.2569 mSv) respectively.
Discussion:
The ULD chest CT images with 98% and 94% dose reduction in 20 patients suspected of Covid
19, were examined by two expert radiologists blinded to each other report. Both of them
independently reported the existence of the same features in both routine dose and ULD chest CT
protocols. Some of the typical findings, as presented in the result section are; Ground glass opacity,
consolidation, reticular lines, atoll or reverse halo sign and air bronchogram.
The authors of this study decided to use the 94% dose reduction protocol as a ULD CT protocol
in patients suspected of Covid 19. Since chest CT images are used as a very important and valuable
means to detect lung lesions related to new coronavirus (Covid 19) in early stage, ULD chest CT
with 98% dose reduction can be used as a substitute to plain radiograph in non-pandemic situatio n.
This preliminary study shows the importance of ULDCT for early detection of lung infection in
Covid 19 patients by identifying the abnormal structures in the lung such as ground glass opacities
and consolidations. Two questions need to be addressed here, to be explained on the basis of CT’s
operational principles and thus justify the power of the method used. The CT machine works on
8

the principle of x-ray attenuation coefficient of matter in the part of the radiation. The mean
attenuation coefficient (𝜇̂ ) is given by

𝜇̂ = [a(V)ρe + b(V) (ρ e Zeffx )], where ρe is the electron

density and Zeff is the effective atomic number of the material with x=3-4 being the exponent of
the photoelectric absorption while a(V) and b(V) are the coefficients of the Compton scattering
and photoelectric absorption. These quantities, a(V) and b(V) are averaged over the source
spectrum of the CT, with V in kVp, is the operational voltage of the CT machine. While the
Compton scattering part has a weak dependence on the photon energy(E), the photoelectric
absorption has a strong increase (~1/E3 ) with decreasing E. Our computations with the well-known
Boone-Seibert source spectrum [9] show that without filter, a(80)=5.76×10-25 , b(80)=3.34×10-27;
a(120)=5.05×10-25 , b(120)=2.2×10-27 ; while on using a standard aluminum filter of 7 mm
thickness, we have: a(80)=5.4×10-25 , b(80)=5.43×10-28 , a(120)=5.35×10-25 ,b(120)= 4.75×10-28,
where a(V) and b(V) are expressed in cm2 . Thus, in either case, the photoelectric effect contributio n
at V=80 kVp is much higher than that at V=120 kVp. This means that at V=80 kVp, any small
difference in the effective atomic number Zeff, gets highly magnified owing to the higher value of
b(80) than b(120)and significant increase in Zeff x. This is the reason for more sensitive detectability
of structures by increasing the photoelectric contribution (increasing contrast). Enhancement of
the contribution from the Compton scattering part would be very limited, since a(80)≈a(120)~10.90, and the lung is made of low density material (Compton scattering is dominant) [10].
Thus, structures in the lung (any lesion with very small differences atomic number with air) could
be detected in the ULD case even though these is a reduction in the SNR, in the primary stage, due
the fall in the photon number (n), (SNR ~√ 𝑛). On using the Boone-Seibert formula, get the
respective photon numbers to be (a) n(80) =1.41×106 , n(120)=3.40×106 , without added filter and
9

(b) n(80) =2.56×103 and n(120)=3.25×104 for the case with aluminum added filter of 7mm
thickness (the most common added filter in CT x-ray tube). The photon number for 80 kVp with
filter is thus only 7.8% of the corresponding one in the 80kVp case while the SNR in the ULDCT
case is thus lower by a factor of √2.56⁄3.25, i.e. 0.35 than that in the normal case. We believe,
this SNR is still high enough for the iterative algorithm to use and bring the contrast, due to
enhanced differences in photoelectric effect contributions [11].
Another important issue is that in the case of ULDCT the total number of photons is further
reduced to (1/50th ) of that in the normal dose. This implies that even if multiple exposures are
taken (less than 10, say) at follow-up, the total photon exposure would still remain a small fraction
of what is given for the normal dose. The SNR, though reduced by a factor of 0.14, from that of
the normal dose, is presumed to be not beyond the power of the Iterative Reconstruction of
algorithm to correct for. This is important for the patients’ safety as well as for that of the technical
staff. This low voltage and mAs, used in ULDCT, would also protect the machines from
breakdown, which is another important requirement for dealing with the situation under the threat
of Covid 19 epidemic.
Since, the SNR and noise per pixel are comparable for chest CT images with routine, 98% and
94% dose reduction protocols, therefore, we can conclude that the noise increment due to dose
reduction protocols are compensated by the iterative reconstruction (IMR level 1). Then chest CT
images, taken by routine and ULD protocols, have adequate SNR and noise per pixel and do not
deteriorate diagnostic image quality.
We have noticed while writing this paper that Dangis A. et al have reported that low dose lowdose submillisievert chest CT can be used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [7]. We thus consider
10

our paper to be extremely topical, more so because the dose in our observations is much lower
(mean effective dose is 0.256 mSv) than that above authors (mean effective dose is 0.56 mSv)
have used. Further, physical explanations of SNR and attenuation coefficient justified that
structures in the image are not due to errors arising out of noise. Our work has been done with
minimum dose that has been reported so far.
Conclusion:
Chest CT images with 94% dose reduction can be used to detect Covid 19 lesions at an early stage
and be used as an important follow up tool, in the treatment. Reducing dose by ULD protocol
reduces the stochastic effects such as genetic disorder and cancer in patients, especially in
pediatric, young and pregnant patients. Also, using ULD CT protocols reduces the CT system’s
work load, therefore increases the stability and lifetime of x-ray tubes. In the background of the
new pandemic (Covid 19), there is an increasing demand for chest CT requests in 2020 compared
to the same season in the previous years. Its importance is in diagnosis of covid 19 patients is
pointed out in the present paper. The authors of this study suggest that ULD chest CT protocol
with 94% dose reduction should be used as a new guideline to substitute routine dose chest CT.
