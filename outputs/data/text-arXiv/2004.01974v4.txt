Abstract
The current global health emergency triggered by the pandemic COVID-19 is one of the greatest challenges mankind face in this
generation. Computational simulations have played an important role to predict the development of the current pandemic. Such
simulations enable early indications on the future projections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control
action in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SEIR model is a well-known method used in computational simulations of
infectious viral diseases and it has been widely used to model other epidemics such as Ebola, SARS, MERS, and influenza A. This
paper presents a modified SEIRS model with additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and resusceptibility, where we can
tune the exit conditions in the model to extend prediction on the current projections of the pandemic into three possible outcomes;
death, recovery, and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility. The model also considers specific information such as ageing
factor of the population, time delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, as well as resusceptibility
with temporal immune response. Owing to huge variations in clinical symptoms exhibited by COVID-19, the proposed model aims
to reflect better on the current scenario and case data reported, such that the spread of the disease and the efficiency of the control
action taken can be better understood. The model is verified using two case studies for verification and prediction studies, based on
the real-world data in South Korea and Northern Ireland, respectively.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease COVID-19 is a respiratory infection disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
The first COVID-19 outbreak was reported in Wuhan of Hubei
Province, China at the end of December 2019. Within just two
months, the disease has rapidly spread across the world and it
has been declared a global pandemic in early March 2020. As
of 20th April 2020, the virus has affected close to 2.5 million
people with approximately 170,000 confirmed deaths across at
least 184 countries [1].
The symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus have large
variations with most people only experiencing mild to moderate
respiratory illnesses and only a smaller group of people would
develop complications of respiratory failure or acute respiratory
distress syndrome. Based on clinical data reported from Wuhan
where the outbreak began, elderly patients have been identified
to have higher odds to experience severe symptoms with higher
mortality rate compared to people of younger age [2]. Study
also shows that up to approximately 80% of the people infected

with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic carriers, i.e. they experience no or mild symptoms but are still able to transport the
virus to others [3]. This has caused the detection and containment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be much more challenging.
As a result, social distancing has been widely implemented in
many countries worldwide to slow down the transportation of
the virus through minimised human-to-human contact. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 after experiencing
mild or moderate symptoms are more likely to develop temporary resistant towards the virus and are unlikely to experience
severe respiratory illnesses [4]. However, in rare occasions,
there have been clinical findings showing that patients who have
recovered from the disease have been tested positive again. For
instance, in February 2020, a patient in Osaka, Japan, has been
tested positive towards the SARS-CoV-2 a few days after being
discharged from the hospital for treatment with the disease [5].
Due to very limited knowledge on the immune response of humans to this novel virus, the possibility of reinfection cannot be
ruled out at the moment.
Mathematical modelling and computational simulations
have played important roles in describing the dynamics of infectious diseases using nonlinear systems so that
their risks could be better understood [6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11]. Most notably, the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-InfectedMay 28, 2020

2. Modelling COVID-19 Using Modified SEIRS

Removed/Recovered) model has been widely reported during
the past decades in quantitative modelling studies of infectious
epidemic/pandemic, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 [12], the influenza A (pH1N1) pandemic in 2009 [13], the Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS) pandemic in 2013 [14], as well as the latest Ebola
outbreak in 2018 [15]. The SEIR model represents a typical
infectious epidemic disease using four distinctive phases; susceptible (S) represents the population that has yet to be infected
by the virus; exposed (E) represents the number of individuals
exposed to the virus; infected (I) models the number of people
infected, have demonstrated symptoms, and are able to spread
the virus to the people in the S compartment; and lastly, recovered/removed (R) models the number of people who have
recovered and are assumed to have immune response towards
the virus [16, 17, 18, 19]. Thus, based on the model, the S compartment will slowly deplete as the outbreak prolongs further,
and the virus will eventually die out due to insufficient population within the S compartment. This compartmental modelling
method allows transport of population from one compartment
to another, where the disease transmission rates with respect to
time can be simulated.

First, let’s consider the modified SEIRS model system below,
dS (t)

dE(t)

dI(t)

dR(t)
dt
dD(t)

= Λ − µS (t) − β(1 − σ)S (t)I(t) + R s (t),

(1)

= β(1 − σ)S (t)I(t) − (µ + α)E(t),

(2)

= αE(t) − (µ + γ)I(t) − ∆I(t)

(3)

= γI(t) − µR(t) − R s (t),

(4)

= ∆I(t),

(5)

where S (t), E(t), I(t), R(t), and D(t) represent the susceptible,
exposed, infected, recovered/removed, and deaths compartments, respectively. It is established that S (t) + E(t) + I(t) +
R(t) + D(t) = N(t), where N(t) is the total stock population.
The constant Λ is the birth rate in the overall population and µ
is the death rate due to conditions other than COVID-19. The
parameter β is the rate of transmission per S-I contact, α is the
rate of which an exposed person becomes infected, and γ is the
recovery rate. Therefore, the incubation and recovery times are
τinc = α1 and τrec = γ1 , respectively. The constant σ is the efficiency of the control action to reduce the infection rate and to
flatten the curve. It has a direct effect on the basic reproduction
number R0 , which will be explained further later in this paper.
The parameter ∆ = δ [(1 − κold )Nold + (1 − κ)(1 − Nold )]
comes into effect in the worst case scenario where the patient
does not recover from the virus. We model the fatality rate with
influence of the fraction of elderly population (above 65 years
of age) within the community Nold , where the percentages of
nonelderly and elderly who recovered are κ and κold , respectively. The time spent hospitalised or infected in fatal cases is
τhosp = 1δ . In this paper, we establish that τhosp = τrec , assuming that patients spend the same amount of time hospitalised or
infected, whether they recover from the virus or not.
The function R s (t) represents the resusceptible stock, which
can be computed from the recovered population using

In this work, we propose a modified SEIRS model based on
the Kermack-McKendrick model [20] with consideration for
time delay and resusceptibility to the virus after recovery. In
this model, the probability of a recovered patient to be reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 is taken into consideration to predict
the future projection of COVID-19 cases. Resusceptibility is
one of the crucial keys that could possibility lead to a prolonged
COVID-19 pandemic. Time delay in the control action representing the time taken for the authorities to act on the virus and
also the duration of short-term immunity after recovery, which
may lead to resusceptibility, are also considered in the model.
The time delay factor is applied to enhance the robustness and
accuracy of the model and simulation, hence to better reflect on
the timely situation with specific measures to control the transmission of the disease. The consideration for resusceptibility
with time delay is an important highlight in this paper as it has
rarely been considered in the SEIR models reported thus far
[18, 21, 22]. Other than that, we also included information such
as demographic details for the ageing population, who seem to
experience a higher fatality rate due to COVID-19 [23].

R s (t) = ξR(t),

(6)

where ξ is the percentage of the recovered population who
are resusceptible to the virus. The number of actual recovered/removed cases with permanent immunity can then be written using
Rc (t) = R(t) − R s (t).
(7)
In an ideal situation, population who recovered develop permanent immunity against the virus, i.e. ξ = 0. As a result, (6)
becomes R s (t) = 0 and subsequently, (7) becomes Rc (t) = R(t).

This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the
mathematical model; Section 3 presents the theoretical proofs
for the positivity, boundedness, and stability of the model, as
well as describes the model with time delay factors for the control action and potential resusceptibility; Section 4 verifies the
proposed model and also provides some extensive results and
discussions on predictions using the model through case studies based on real-world data; and Section 5 concludes the paper.
Appendix A presents the design of the simulation package using the MATLAB/Simulink environment.

3. Positivity, Boundedness, and Equilibrium Analysis of the
Model
3.1. Positivity of the Solutions
Lemma 1. The solutions to all subpopulations
(S (t), E(t), I(t), R(t), D(t)) in the system (1)–(5) are nonnegative
3

Assuming that N(t) >> D(t), and since Lemma 1 has established that all subpopulations are nonnegative and given that all
parameters are assumed to be positive, then (8) becomes

for all time t ≥ 0 given any finite nonnegative initial conditions
of (S (0) ≥ 0, E(0) ≥ 0, I(0) ≥ 0, R(0) ≥ 0, D(0) ≥ 0).
Proof. Firstly, it is established that all subpopulations
(S (t), E(t), I(t), R(t), D(t)) defined by the system (1)–(5) are
continuously differentiable. As such, if all subpopulations have
nonnegative initial conditions, and that if any of the subpopulations is zero at time t = ti ≥ 0, its derivative is nonnegative by
inspection. Assume that S (0) ≥ 0, S (t1 ) = 0, and R s (t1 ) ≥ 0 at
time instant t = t1 . Then, we can rewrite (1) using

dN(t)
≈ Λ − µN(t).
dt
We can then deduce that
dN(t)
≤ Λ − µN(t),
dt

dS (t1 )
= Λ + R s (t1 ) ≥ 0,
dt

(10)

where an integration of the inequality (10) yields

where we can establish that S (t1+ ) ≥ 0 and hence, S (t) is nonnegative for all time t ≥ 0. Next, assume that E(0) ≥ 0,
E(t2 ) = 0, S (t2 ) ≥ 0, and I(t2 ) ≥ 0 at time instant t = t2 . We can
rewrite (2) using

for all time t ≥ 0. As a result, the stock population is finitely
upperbounded and hence, the proof is complete.

dE(t2 )
= β(1 − σ)S (t2 )I(t2 ) ≥ 0,

3.3. Disease-free Equilibrium
Lemma 3. The disease-free equilibrium E DFE is locally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number R0 < 1.

so that E(t2+ ) ≥ 0 and hence, E(t) is nonnegative for all time
t ≥ 0. Assume that I(0) ≥ 0, I(t3 ) = 0, and E(t3 ) ≥ 0 at time
instant t = t3 . Equation (3) then becomes

Proof. The disease-free equilibrium can be obtained by equating equations (1)(4) to zero, hence satisfying

dI(t3 )
= αE(t3 ) ≥ 0,
dt
where we can establish that I(t3+ ) ≥ 0 and hence, I(t) is nonnegative for all time t ≥ 0. Assume that R(0) ≥ 0, R(t4 ) = 0, and
I(t4 ) ≥ 0 at time instant t = t4 . Equation (4) can be rewritten
using
dR(t4 )
= γI(t4 ) ≥ 0,
dt
so that R(t4+ ) ≥ 0 and hence, R(t) is nonnegative for all time
t ≥ 0. Finally, assume that D(0) ≥ 0, D(t5 ) = 0, and I(t5 ) ≥ 0 at
time instant t = t5 . We can then rewrite (5) using

Λ − µS (t) − β(1 − σ)S (t)I(t) + R s (t) = 0,

(11)

β(1 − σ)S (t)I(t) − (µ + α)E(t) = 0,

(12)

αE(t) − (µ + γ)I(t) − ∆I(t) = 0,

(13)

γI(t) − µR(t) − R s (t) = 0,

(14)

of
 which  the disease-free equilibrium is given by E DFE =
Λ
µ , 0, 0, 0 . Equation (5) can be removed from this analysis
without loss of generality as other equations do not depend on
it. It can then be shown that the Jacobian for (1)(4) at E DFE is
written using

dD(t5 )
= ∆I(t5 ) ≥ 0,
dt
where we can establish that D(t5+ ) ≥ 0 and hence, D(t) is nonnegative for all time t ≥ 0.
It can be seen that since none of the subpopulations would
have a negative derivative at any time instant of t = ti when all
other subpopulations are nonnegative, then it can be concluded
that all subpopulations are nonnegative for all time t ≥ 0. As a
result, given that N(t) = S (t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) + D(t), the stock
population N(t) is also nonnegative for all time t ≥ 0. Hence,
the proof is complete.

As such, the basic reproduction number with the control action is defined using

where for a disease-free system that is locally asymptotically
stable, we need to ensure that R0 < 1 while an unstable E DFE
would translate to R0 > 1. Hence, the proof is complete.

b3 = −(µ + κI ∗ )((µ + α)(µ + γ + ∆) − ακS ∗ ) − ακ2 S ∗ I ∗ ,
= −(µ + κI ∗ )(µ2 + µ(α + γ + ∆) + α(γ + ∆)) + µακS ∗ .

Should there be no control action taken, i.e. σ = 0, then the
basic reproduction number in (18) becomes

It is obvious that the first eigenvalue is λ1 = −µ − ξ. It can
also be shown that in order for the remaining eigenvalues to be
negative such that the endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, i.e. b1 < 0, b2 > 0, and b3 < 0, we would require
that R0 > 1 while an unstable E EE would translate to R0 < 1.
Hence, the proof is complete.

which is similar to other models found in the literature [6, 9,
10]. See [24] and the references within for a brief study on
using control theory to fight COVID-19.
3.4. Endemic Equilibrium
Lemma 4. The endemic equilibrium E EE is locally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number R0 > 1.

For the remaining of this paper where we verify the model
and perform predictions using real-world data in Section 4, and
also for the model used in the simulation package presented in
Appendix A, we assume a closed population with negligible
birth and death rates, i.e. Λµ ≈ 1, Λ ≈ 0, µ ≈ 0. Time delay
factors are also considered for the control action taken as well
as resusceptibility. As a result, the system (1)(5) becomes

Proof. Let’s assume that the system (1)(4), which other than
the disease-free equilibrium has a unique equilibrium at E EE =
(S ∗ , E ∗ , I ∗ , R∗ ) such that

It can be seen that the model has no positive endemic equilibrium if R0 < 1 for E ∗ , I ∗ , and R∗ would be negative, which
indicate an unrealistic biological system. If R0 = 1, then we
would have the disease-free equilibrium E DFE discussed earlier in Section 3.3. Hence, for a positive endemic equilibrium
system, we would require that R0 > 1.

The time delay τσ = τ pre−σ + τ post−σ indicates the time taken
for the control action to take effect in flattening the infection
curve, where τ pre−σ ≥ 0 represents the time to initiate the control action after the first confirmed case at t = 0, and τ post−σ ≥ 0
represents the time after the control action has been initiated but
before the effects are evidenced in the outputs of the system. In
practical scenarios, τ post−σ can be used to model the delay for
the population to effectively respond to the rules introduced by
the control action, such as social distancing, self-isolation, and
lockdown.
The function R s (t, τξ ) represents the resusceptible stock with

managed to effectively flatten the infection curve and it has set
itself apart from others in leading the fight against COVID-19,
at least for the moment. For example, the country started vigorous testing among its population with contact tracing, especially those of confirmed and suspected cases during the early
stage of the epidemic. The government accomplished this by
maintaining a public database keeping track of mobile phones,
credit cards, and other data of patients who tested positive [29].
Also, on 16th March 2020, the authorities in the country began
screening every person, both domestic and international, who
arrived at its airports.
As of 20th April 2020, there have been 10,674 confirmed
cases and 236 fatalities in South Korea [1]. As a result, we
used the following parameters for our simulation. First, we assumed that the population of South Korea to be approximately
N = 51.5×106 with an elderly population of about 15% (Nold =
0.15) [30]. We then set the percentage of recovery to be 98%
(κ = 0.98) for the general public [1] and a fatality rate of 8%
((1 − κold ) = 0.08) for the elderly [31]. We then assumed the
incubation time and recovery time to be τinc = 5.1, and τrec =
18.8, respectively in accordance with [32]. The basic reproduction number was set to R0 = 5.1 (95% CI: 4.97–5.23) based
on the early growth-rate of the epidemic in South Korea. The
initial infected and exposed cases were assumed to be I(0) = 4
and E(0) = 20I(0), respectively. See Table 1. Figure 2a shows
the results of the initial fitting of the model based on the data
in South Korea while Figure 2b shows the projections of the
model when no control action is taken. There are some minor
discrepancies between the modelled values and the real-world
data during the initial stage of the simulation as seen in Figure
2a. This is absolutely reasonable and acceptable while modelling an actual epidemic as most countries are still coming to
terms with the virus during the first month and the data do not
usually represent the actual number of cases due to lack of testing for confirmed cases.
Once we have the initial fitting of the model, we introduced
control action in line with the mitigation and preventive measures taken by the government. Due to the aforementioned vigorous testing, contact tracing, and isolation efforts taken, we
assumed that the control action has an efficiency of 88% (σ =
0.88). As a result, the reproduction number could be reduced to
R0 ≈ 0.61. We also assumed that there was a time delay of 30
days since the first confirmed case before the control action was

(28)

where the time delay τξ ≥ 0 represents the duration of temporal
immune response of the recovered population. Hence, we can
also update the expression for the number of recovered cases
introduced in (7) using
Rc (t) = R(t) − R s (t, τξ ).

Value

(29)

In an ideal situation where population who recovered develop
permanent immunity against the virus, ξ = 0 and τξ → ∞. As
a result, (28) becomes R s (t, ∞) = 0 and subsequently, (29) can
be rewritten as Rc (t) = R(t).
The block diagram of the proposed SEIRS model with time
delay is shown in Figure 1. The system with time delay is assumed to be stable and will exhibit similar disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium properties as the system without
time delay provided that the time delay parameters are nonnegative, i.e. τσ ≥ 0, τξ ≥ 0. Detailed discussions on the theoretical stability analysis of SEIR and similar epidemic models with
time delay can be found in studies such as [19, 25, 26, 27].
4. Case Studies
4.1. Case Study 1: Verification using Data in South Korea
South Korea is used as a case study due to the amount of data
available given that it is one of the first few countries to be directly affected by the virus outside of China. Its first confirmed
case was reported on 20th January 2020 [28]. The other reason
is that South Korea is also one of the very few countries that

since the first confirmed case, and assuming that it took a further
approximately 12 days for the public to respond to these control
action, i.e. τ post−σ = 12, we obtained the simulation results
as shown in Figure 7. The results show that in order for the
model to follow the projected trajectories of the data from PHA
in Figure 7a, the control action have to achieve an efficiency of
about 45% (σ = 0.45), which indicates that the reproduction
number could be reduced to R0 ≈ 2.75. Comparing Figure 6b
with Figure 7b, the peak of the number of infected cases could
be reduced from 650,000 cases to 350,000 cases.

in this research; the first case for verification of the model based
on the data in South Korea including a study on the possibility of resusceptibility of recovered population; and the second
case for prediction study of the model using data and up-to-date
control action and related events in Northern Ireland. The simulation results from the case studies have clearly shown that the
time of which the control action is taken and also the time for
the public to properly respond to such intervention measures
are critical in helping to flatten the curve. Also, until a time
where a vaccine is developed and made available to the general public, the possibility of resusceptibility, no matter how
small, will lead to subsequent waves of infections in the future depending on the time of temporal immunity. A simulation
package was developed using the MATLAB/Simulink environment to ease understanding on the spread of the virus as well as
the efficiency that needs to be achieved by the control action in
order to successfully flatten the infection curve to not overload
the healthcare capacity.
Interesting future research and expansion of the model include but not limited to the predictions for the occupancy of
ICU beds, the effects of easing control action on R0 and hence,
the time of which control action have to be reinstigated, as well
as specific subregions analysis such as demographic information to model the transmission of the virus among subregions in
the country to cater for population movements and travels.

4.2.1. Further Control Action To Meet Critical Care Capacity
However, based on the results shown in Figure 7, it is essential to further flatten this curve due to the limit of about
330 critical care beds available in Northern Ireland (100 initial
setup + 230 introduced by the newly built Nightingale hospital) [40]. According to the Intensive Care National Audit &
Research Centre (ICNARC) with its “Report on 2249 patients
critically ill with COVID-19” dated 4th April 2020, about 6%
of those tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 required critical
care [41]. Meanwhile in Italy, as of 29th March 2020, up to
12% of all positive cases were admitted to the intensive care
unit (ICU) [42]. As such, should we assume that approximately
10% of those tested positive in Northern Ireland would require
ICU admission, then the peak of the infection curve should not
exceed 3,300 cases, i.e. more control action have to be taken to
reduce the peak of 350,000 cases as seen in Figure 7b.
Therefore, on day 38, which is about one week after the infection curve started to flatten due to the first control action, a
second control action was introduced into the model. This second control action also reflects on the announcement made by
the United Kingdom government in early April 2020 to allow
police officers to enforce social distancing measures. Assuming
that this second control action results in a further efficiency of
66%, the reproduction number could then be reduced to R0 ≈
0.93, and that it would take another 7 days for the public to
fully respond to the control action, we could observe the results
as shown in Figure 8. With the initiation of the second control
action, it can be seen in Figure 8a that the peak in the infection
curve is now reduced to 3,500 cases. As such, the critical care
capacity should be able to meet the demand for treatment based
on the same assumption made earlier in this section, where it
is estimated about 10% of the infected cases are admitted to
the ICU. Another observation worth noting is that the number
of deaths in the worst case scenario has also been reduced to
about 3,000 cases. See Figure 8b. This value echos the projection made by the government in Northern Ireland that COVID19 could lead to 3,000 deaths during the first wave [43].

Appendix A. Description of The Simulation Package
Figure A.9 shows the graphical user interface (GUI) of the
simulation package developed using the MATLAB/Simulink
environment. Users can use this interface to set preferred settings for the simulation and also to view simulation results.
The simulation kit can be downloaded from https://github.
com/nkymark/COVIDSim.
Appendix A.1. Establishing Simulation Settings
At the top section of the GUI are some interactive interfaces
available for the user to set key simulation settings, which include the following:
• General Settings:
13

– Stock Data: Use this to load real-world data of select
countries. The data are obtained from [1].
– Stock Population: The stock population N is entered
here.
– Recovered Cases: Use this to set the percentage of
recovered cases κ.
– Elderly Population: Use this to set the fraction of
elderly population (above 65 years of age) Nold .
– Elderly Fatality Rate: Use this to set the fatality rate
(1 − κold ) for the elderly population.
– SEIR Parameters: Use this to set the values for
R0 , τinc , τrec , the initial infected cases I(0), and the
simulation time.
• Resusceptibility Settings:
– Resusceptible Cases: Use this to set the percentage
of recovered cases who are resusceptible.
– Duration of temporal immunity: Use this to set the
time of short-term immune response τξ , assuming
there is no permanent immunity after recovery.
• Control Action Settings:
– Control Action Efficiency: Use this to set the percentage of control action efficiency σ.
– Pre-action Time Delay: Use this to set the time delay
τ pre−σ for the control action to be introduced after the
first confirmed case.
– Post-action Time Delay: Use this to set the time delay
τ post−σ to mimic the time it takes for the population
to respond to the control action.
Appendix A.2. Simulation Results
The simulation results are displayed at the bottom section of
the GUI. The plot on the right shows the initial fit of the model
using the settings established in Section Appendix A.1 onto the
real-world data of the select country, while the plot on the left
shows the simulation results until the simulation stop time.
