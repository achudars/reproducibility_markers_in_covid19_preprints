Background: The infection fatality rate (IFR) of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
is one of the most discussed figures in the context of this pandemic. In contrast to the case
fatality rate (CFR), the IFR depends on the total number of infected individuals – not just
on the number of confirmed cases. In order to estimate the IFR, several seroprevalence studies
have been or are currently conducted.
Methods: Using German COVID-19 surveillance data and age-group specific IFR estimates
from multiple international studies, this work investigates time-dependent variations in effective
IFR over the course of the pandemic. Three different methods for estimating (effective) IFRs
are presented: (a) population-averaged IFRs based on the assumption that the infection risk is
independent of age and time, (b) effective IFRs based on the assumption that the age distribution
of confirmed cases approximately reflects the age distribution of infected individuals, and (c)
effective IFRs accounting for age- and time-dependent dark figures of infections.
Results: Effective IFRs in Germany are estimated to vary over time, as the age distributions
of confirmed cases and estimated infections are changing during the course of the pandemic. In
particular during the first and second waves of infections in spring and autumn/winter 2020,
there has been a pronounced shift in the age distribution of confirmed cases towards older age
groups, resulting in larger effective IFR estimates. The temporary increase in effective IFR
during the first wave is estimated to be smaller but still remains when adjusting for age- and
time-dependent dark figures. A comparison of effective IFRs with observed CFRs indicates that
a substantial fraction of the time-dependent variability in observed mortality can be explained
by changes in the age distribution of infections. Furthermore, a vanishing gap between effective
IFRs and observed CFRs is apparent after the first infection wave, while a moderately increasing
gap can be observed during the second wave.
Conclusions: As the mortality of COVID-19 largely increases with age, it is important to take
the changing age distribution of infected individuals into account to determine the effective IFR.
Further research is warranted to obtain timely age-stratified IFR estimates.

Estimating effective infection fatality rates in Germany

Background

The ongoing pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 provides enormous global challenges for public health, society and economy. An important figure in the context of this pandemic
is the infection fatality rate (IFR), defined by the number of COVID-19 associated deaths divided
by the total number of infections. In contrast to the case fatality rate (CFR), the IFR is not only
based on the number of confirmed cases and should therefore not be biased by potential drifts in
testing policies. However, as the total number of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is generally unknown,
the IFR can only be estimated based on available surveillance and seroprevalence data.
Many seroprevalence studies have been conducted worldwide with the aim of estimating the true
numbers of infections and resulting IFRs. Also in Germany, several local seroprevalence studies
are being conducted (e.g. [1]); a completed study from the early phase of the pandemic in the
high-prevalence region of Gangelt, Heinsberg, reports an estimated population-averaged IFR of
0.41% (95% confidence interval [0.33%; 0.52%]), based on 8 observed deaths until 20th of April [2].
Overviews of completed studies from a wide range of countries can for example be found in [3] and
[4]. The meta-analysis of Meyerowitz-Katz et al. [3] yields an estimated population-averaged IFR
of 0.68% [0.53%; 0.82%], while in the meta-analysis of Ioannidis [4] estimated population-averaged
IFRs range from 0.02% to 0.86% with a median IFR of 0.26%. Although the two meta-analyses differ
heavily regarding their results and conclusions, both observe a high heterogeneity in populationaveraged IFR estimates among different studies and emphasize the importance of obtaining reliable
age-stratified estimates.
More recent meta-analyses [5, 6] investigate age-specific mortality by estimating infection fatality
rates for different age groups. As the risk of death from COVID-19 is estimated to increase exponentially with age [6], it is crucial that the age distribution of infections is taken into account when
interpreting estimated “overall” (population-averaged) IFRs from different seroprevalence studies
in different regions. In fact, a large proportion of the variability in estimated IFRs between studies
in different regions may be explained simply by differences in demographics, particularly the age
structure of populations. In addition, other factors such as the prevalence of certain comorbidities,
the access to intensive medical care and systematic differences in social networks might also contribute to the variability of COVID-19 associated mortality in different regions.
However, even when considering only a particular region, the observed mortality of SARS-CoV-2
may vary over time, as the age distribution of the infected population may be changing throughout the pandemic, e.g. due to different and changing risk behaviours as well as specific preventive
measures for high-risk groups. In a recent study regarding “the foreshadow of a second wave” in
Germany, Linden et al. [7] estimate the effective IFR as a time-dependent measure by considering
the infection fatality rate given the changing age distribution of confirmed cases, using age-specific
IFR estimates from the meta-analysis of Levin et al. [6]. The effective IFR is estimated based on
the assumption that the distribution of confirmed cases reflects the distribution of true infections
[7]. This may not necessarily be the case, as e.g. infections with SARS-CoV-2 may be more likely
detected in older age groups since these tend to experience a more serious disease course. Furthermore, as the focus of the study by Linden et al. [7] has been on the analysis of the beginning of a

second wave of infections during late summer 2020, effective IFRs have not been reported for the
earlier phase of the pandemic in Germany.
Thus, our study aims to investigate time-dependent variations in effective IFR over the course
of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, by combining age-specific IFR estimates from multiple
studies with publicly available German surveillance data. We compare estimated effective IFRs
based on the age distribution of confirmed cases with estimates derived from the age distribution of
estimated infections, obtained through estimated age- and time-dependent dark figures. Results are
presented based on age-specific IFR estimates from four different studies, illustrating the remaining
uncertainty regarding age-specific mortality.

Methods

We use the German COVID-19 surveillance data provided by the Robert Koch Institute [8], containing information on date of disease onset (or date of confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection if
disease onset unknown) and information on deaths associated with COVID-19 for individual confirmed cases. Data on age of confirmed cases and deaths are available for the following age groups
A = {0-4, 5-14, 15-34, 35-59, 60-79, 80+}.
We consider cumulative data for each calendar week, so that potential weekday-specific fluctuations
are eliminated. P
Let Ca,t denote the number of confirmed cases for age group a ∈ A in calendar week
t and let Ct = a∈A Ca,t denote the total number of confirmed cases in week t. Similarly, let Ia,t
and It denote the number of true infections and let Da,t and Dt denote the number of deaths, for
age group a and week t. Note that deaths typically occur weeks after the onset of symptoms from
COVID-19 with an estimated average interval of 16 days [9], while infections with SARS-CoV-2
occur several days prior to manifestation of disease with an estimated median incubation period of
5 days [10]. However, here the time point t in Ca,t , Ia,t and Da,t always refers to the same week
where the infection has been manifested or confirmed. The course of weekly confirmed cases and
deaths for the different age groups in Germany is depicted in Figure 1.
The observed CFR in week t is defined by the number of deaths Dt (resulting from infections in
t
week t) divided by the number of confirmed cases Ct in week t, i.e. CFRt = D
Ct . On the other hand,
the effective IFR in week t is defined based on the total number of infections, i.e. IFReff,t = DItt .
As the number of infections It is unknown, we estimate the weekly effective IFR by taking into
account the time-dependent distribution of infections in the different age groups a ∈ A as well as
age-specific IFR estimates from four different studies. In particular, we consider one modelling
study [11] estimating age-specific IFR for China based on individual-case data from the early phase
of the pandemic (until 25th of February), one seroprevalence study [12] in Geneva, Switzerland
(until 1st of June) specifically designed for age-stratified estimation of IFR, as well as two recent
meta-analyses [5, 6] combining the evidence from multiple seroprevalence studies worldwide. As
the age groups in the four sources of estimated IFR slightly differ from the age groups A considered in the used surveillance data, age-specific IFR estimates are adjusted to match with the age
groups A via weighted averaging of estimates, taking into account the age structure of the German

derived under different assumptions regarding the distribution of infections.

Assumption (3) and the resulting estimator (4) correspond also to the effective IFR defined
in [7]. Note that assumption (3) implies that dark figures of undetected infections are approximately independent of age.
(c) Without specific assumptions as in (a) and (b), the number of infections Ia,t can be alternatively estimated by considering age- and time-dependent dark figures via

Results

The risk of death among persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to increase substantially
with increasing age by each of the four considered studies (Table 1), which is also supported by the
number of observed deaths Da,t per age group in Germany (see Figure 1). However, estimates from
the literature show larger discrepancies; as for example in age group 80+, the IFR estimate from
[12] is given by 5.60% [4.30%; 7.40%], while the corresponding IFR estimate from [6] is as large as
15.61% [12.20%; 19.50%]. On the other hand, for the age group 60-79 the IFR estimate from [5]
is approximately 1%, while the other studies yield larger estimates for this age group ranging from
2.49% in [6] to 3.89% in [12]. Furthermore, Table 1 gives estimates of resulting population-averaged
(i)
infection fatality rates IFRDE for Germany, which are derived under the assumption that the risk
of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is independent of age and time (see assumption (a)). Population(i)
averaged estimates IFRDE for Germany range from 0.756% [0.717%; 0.796%] by [5] to 1.687%
[1.407%; 2.139%] by [6], reflecting the uncertainty regarding age-specific IFR.
(i)

The estimated population-averaged infection fatality rates IFRDE , based on different age-specific
IFR estimates, can be interpreted as reference mortality figures for the general German population
in order to compare them to other countries. They have a rather theoretical meaning as they do
not reflect the actual age distribution of the infected population. Figure 2 depicts the changing
age distribution of weekly confirmed cases (central plot) in comparison to the age distribution of
the general population (left plot). It can be observed that the age distribution of confirmed cases
shifted considerably towards older age groups during the first wave in Germany in March and April

Levin et al. [6].

2020. During summer with a relatively low incidence of COVID-19, confirmed cases were predominantly observed in younger age groups. However, since September 2020, percentages of confirmed
cases among the elderly have been continuously rising again. In the end of December 2020, the age
distribution of confirmed cases is remarkably similar to the distribution of confirmed cases in April
during the first wave of infections.
The described trend in the distribution of confirmed cases over time is directly reflected in the
corresponding development of estimated effective IFR (based on method (b)). The left side in
Figure 3 shows that the estimated effective IFR sharply increases from values between 0.5% and
1% in March to values between 1.5% and 3.5% in April. After this peak, the estimated effective
IFR has been declining to values between 0.2% and 0.5% in the end of August, corresponding to a
relatively young age distribution of confirmed cases. This observation may be partly explained by
an increased mobility of younger age groups during the summer holiday period. Since September
2020, as the distribution of confirmed cases has been shifting more towards older age groups, effective IFR estimates have been rising again up to similar levels as in the peak during the first wave
of infections. This indicates that with larger SARS-CoV-2 incidences (see Figure 1) it may become
increasingly difficult to effectively protect vulnerable risk groups and to prevent the spread of the
virus from younger to older age groups (see also [7]).
As the age distribution of confirmed cases may not generally reflect the age distribution of true infections, in a further analysis we account for age- and time-dependent dark figures (see method (c)).

d eff,t in Germany for the year 2020, based
Figure 3: Estimated (weekly) effective infection fatality rates IFR
on four different age-specific IFR estimates (i). The left plots refer to the estimates with method (b) based
on the age distribution of confirmed cases, while the plots on the right refer to the estimates with method (c)
based on the age distribution of infections via estimated age- and time-dependent dark figures. The lower
plots additionally display observed CFRs in Germany. Due to the expected time lag between infections
and deaths, observed CFRs are only shown until the end of November; similarly, effective IFR estimates
with method (c) are only accounted for estimated dark figures (based on observed CFRs) until the end of
November.

The right hand side of Figure 2 depicts the development of estimated true infections based on IFR
estimates from Levin et al. [6]. It can be seen that the development of estimated infections is similar
in shape to the observed development of confirmed cases. However, in particular following the high
phase of the first wave of infections in April (compare Figure 1), the estimated distribution of infections is shifted towards younger age groups in comparison to the distribution of confirmed cases.
This shift results from dark figures of infections which are estimated to be larger in younger age
groups in comparison to the age group 80+ during this particular time. A plausible explanation for

this observation might be that in times of limited testing capacities, preferential testing of individuals in age group 80+ has been more pronounced, as these patients are more likely to show (severe)
symptoms from COVID-19 requiring medical intervention. Similar effects on estimated infections
during the first wave are also observed when using age-specific IFR estimates from O’Driscoll et
al. [5] and Perez-Saez et al. [12], whereas numbers of infections in age group 80+ are estimated
to be comparatively larger based on Verity et al. [11] (detailed results on estimated infections not
shown). During summer 2020, there seems to be a close alignment of estimated infections with
confirmed cases, as age-dependent factors for dark figures are estimated to be close to 1 (and would
have partly been even below 1). This may indicate that a large proportion of infections has been
detected with the implemented testing policies during the summer period.
The right hand side of Figure 3 depicts the resulting development of estimated effective IFR when
accounting for age- and time-dependent dark figures. It can be seen that the adjustment for dark
figures has a particular effect during the first wave of the pandemic in Germany, where estimated
effective IFRs tend to be smaller in comparison to the unadjusted estimates based on confirmed
cases (compare to left hand side of Figure 3). However, even when adjusting for age-dependent
dark figures, there still remains a pronounced increase in estimated effective IFRs during the first
wave of infections; this indicates that the increase in mortality cannot exclusively be explained by
preferential testing, but that there has been an actual change in the age distribution of the infected
population. During summer 2020, the age distribution of estimated infections more closely aligns
with the age distribution of confirmed cases and thus the estimates of effective IFR adjusted for
dark figures are very similar to the unadjusted estimates. In contrast to the first wave of infections
in spring 2020, during the second wave the adjusted estimates are not systematically lower and
partly even larger than the unadjusted ones.
Figure 3 also shows the development of estimated effective IFR in comparison with the development
of observed CFR in Germany. It can be seen that trends in observed CFR closely resemble trends in
effective IFR estimated based on the age distribution of confirmed cases (as well as true infections).
This implies that the age distribution of infections is a major determinant (and predictor) for
the resulting mortality associated with COVID-19. Despite this, it can be observed that the gap
between CFR and IFR has been declining after the first wave in Germany; in fact, observed CFRs
in August and September are even lower than some estimates of effective IFR. There may be
multiple possible reasons for the decline in CFR, which are independent of the age distribution of
infections: The first and probably largest contribution to the observed decline in CFR is the steady
and considerable increase in conducted SARS-CoV-2 testing in Germany [14]. For example, the
number of conducted SARS-CoV-2 tests increased from 586,620 in calendar week 31 (end of July) to
1,121,214 tests in calendar week 35 (end of August) [15], reflecting a doubling in weekly conducted
tests in Germany, partly due to increased testing in the context of the summer holiday season.
Another plausible reason for a further decline in observed CFR may be due to improvements in
treatment of COVID-19 or other factors leading to a decrease in age-specific IFR [16]. During
the second wave of infections in autumn/winter 2020, the gap between CFR and IFR tends to be
increasing again, but the CFR is still at much lower levels in comparison to the first wave, as dark
figures of infections during the second wave are estimated to be smaller than during the first.

Mitigation measures
Cancellation of large public events.
Closures of schools, childcare facilities and non-essential stores.
First lockdown, including strict contact restrictions.
Beginning of reopening of stores and schools. Mask requirements in stores and public transport.
Relaxation of several measures, including less stringent contact restrictions.
Introduction of German tracing app (“Corona-Warn-App”).
Specification of “hotspot strategy” with targeted local measures in particularly affected districts.
Lockdown “light”, including stricter contact restrictions and closures of restaurants and leisure facilities.
Second lockdown, including closures of non-essential stores and switch to distance learning in schools.

The course of the pandemic should also be viewed in light of mitigation efforts in Germany
(cf. [17, 18]). Due to the German federal structure there have been specific differences in implemented measures between the 16 federal states, although a uniform procedure has been sought
by the federal government and local states. Table 2 provides an overview of important mitigation
measures which have been applied to most regions of Germany. The effectiveness of interventions
during the first infection wave has been investigated by Dehning et al. [19], concluding that the
entirety of measures in context of the “first lockdown”, implemented in three consecutive weeks
(cf. Table 2), effectively reduced the spread of the virus (cf. Figure 1).
In addition, our results (Figure 3) show a time-delayed decline of effective IFR in May 2020 after the
incidence peak in March and April, indicating that the spread of the virus to older age groups could
be reduced after incidences reached more controllable levels. During summer 2020, with relaxed
mitigating measures still in place, such as the requirement of wearing masks in stores and public
transport, incidences of COVID-19 remained relatively low. In this time, there was a particularly
young age distribution of cases, resulting in small estimated effective IFRs and a reduced disease
burden for high-risk groups. As the second wave of infections in Germany has been ongoing at
the time of writing, it is too early for a conclusive evaluation of mitigation measures, including the
“lockdown light” and the “second lockdown” (see Table 2 and Figure 1); however, our results show
that estimated effective IFRs (and observed CFRs) have been continuously rising with increasing
numbers of cases until December 2020.
Limitations of this study include that the analysis is based on the assumptions that age-specific IFRs
are constant over time and that IFR estimates from the four international studies are applicable to
Germany. Furthermore, in this work we have focused on estimating the effective IFR based on the
changing age distribution of infections; however, in practice many other factors may also contribute
to the variability in mortality of COVID-19, such as the distribution of different comorbidities as
well as the sex distribution of infected individuals. Another limitation of this study is that, due
to relatively small numbers of observed deaths in young age groups, monthly dark figures are
estimated jointly for the wide age group of 0 to 59 years, even though true dark figures may further

differentiate in practice (see e.g. [20] for a recent study of dark figures for children in Germany).
Finally, for the estimation of age- and time-dependent dark figures we assumed that there are
no systematic biases in reported age-specific deaths, which may not necessarily be the case; for
example, Michelozzi et al. [21] investigate the temporal dynamics in excess mortality in Italian
cities and observe an underestimation of COVID-19 deaths for older age groups.

Conclusions

We have illustrated that the effective IFR in Germany is estimated to vary during the course of the
pandemic, as the age distribution of infections is changing over time. In fact, it can be observed
that a large fraction of the time-dependent variability in CFR can be explained by changes in
the age distribution of infections. The additionally observed trends in the gap between the CFR
and effective IFR require further investigation in order to disentangle the contributions of shifts in
testing policies and of other factors that may induce changes in mortality. In particular, obtaining
reliable and timely age-specific IFR estimates for Germany is an important issue for further research.
