ABSTRACT
Specific elements of viral genomes regulate interactions within host cells. Here, we calculated the
secondary structure content of >2500 coronaviruses and computed >100000 human protein
interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We found that
the 3’ and 5’ are the most structured elements in the viral genome and the 5’ has the strongest
propensity to associate with human proteins. The domain encompassing nucleotides 23000 – 24000
is highly conserved both at the sequence and structural level, while the region upstream varies
significantly. These two sequences code for a domain of the viral protein Spike S that interacts with
the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and has the potential to bind sialic
acids. Our predictions indicate that the first 1000 nucleotides in the 5’ can interact with proteins

involved in viral RNA processing such as double-stranded RNA specific editases and ATPdependent RNA-helicases, in addition to other high-confidence candidate partners. These
interactions, previously reported to be also implicated in HIV, reveal important information on hostvirus interactions. The list of transcriptional and post-transcriptional elements recruited by SARSCoV-2 genome provides clues on the biological pathways associated with gene expression changes
in human cells.

INTRODUCTION
A disease named Covid-19 by the World Health Organization and caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized as responsible for the
pneumonia outbreak that started in December, 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei, China 1 and spread in
February to Milan, Lombardy, Italy 2 becoming pandemic. As of April 2020, the virus infected
>2’000’000 people in >200 countries.
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that shares similarities with other betacoronavirus such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 3. Bats have been identified as the primary host for
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 4,5 but the intermediate host linking SARS-CoV-2 to humans is still
unknown, although a recent report indicates that pangolins could be involved 6.
Coronaviruses use species-specific proteins to mediate the entry in the host cell and the spike S
protein activates the infection in human respiratory epithelial cells in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 7. Spike S is assembled as a trimer and contains around 1,300 amino acids within
each unit 8,9. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike S, which contains around 300 amino
acids, mediates the binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme, (ACE2) attacking respiratory
cells. Another region upstream of the RBD, present in MERS-CoV but not in SARS-CoV, is
involved in the adhesion to sialic acid and could play a key role in regulating viral infection 7,10.
At present, very few molecular details are available on SARS-CoV-2 and its interactions with the
human host, which are mediated by specific RNA elements 11. To study the RNA structural content,
we used CROSS 12 that was previously developed to investigate large transcripts such as the human
immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 13. CROSS predicts the structural profile of RNA molecules (single-

2

A. Vandelli et al. Structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2
and double-stranded state) at single-nucleotide resolution using sequence information only. Here,
we performed sequence and structural alignments among 62 SARS-CoV-2 strains and identified the
conservation of specific elements in the spike S region, which provides clues on the evolution of
domains involved in the binding to ACE2 and sialic acid.
As highly structured regions of RNA molecules have strong propensity to form stable contacts with
proteins 14 and promote assembly of specific complexes 15,16, SARS-CoV-2 domains enriched in
double-stranded content are expected to establish interactions within host cells that are important to
replicate the virus 17. To investigate the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with human proteins, we
employed catRAPID 18,19. catRAPID 20 estimates the binding potential of a specific protein for an
RNA molecule through van der Waals, hydrogen bonding and secondary structure propensities
allowing identification of interaction partners with high confidence 21. The unbiased analysis of
more than 100000 protein interactions with SARS-CoV-2 RNA reveals that the 5’ of SARS-CoV-2
has strong propensity to bind to human proteins involved in viral infection and especially reported
to be associated with HIV infection. A comparison between SARS-CoV and HIV reveals indeed
similarities 22, but the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV is still unexplored. Interestingly,
HIV and SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV nor MERS-CoV, have a furin-cleavage site occurring
in the spike S protein, which could explain the spread velocity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARSCoV and MERS-CoV 23,24. Yet, many processes related to SARS-CoV-2 replication are unknown
and our study aims to suggest relevant protein interactions for further investigation.
We hope that our large-scale calculations of structural properties and binding partners of SARSCoV-2 will be useful to identify the mechanisms of virus replication within the human host.
RESULTS
SARS-CoV-2 contains highly structured elements
Structured elements within RNA molecules attract proteins 14 and reveal regions important for
interactions with the host 25. Indeed, each gene expressed from SARS-CoV-2 is preceded by
conserved transcription-regulating sequences that act as signal for the transcription complex during
the synthesis of the RNA minus strand to promote a strand transfer to the leader region to resume
the synthesis. This process is named discontinuous extension of the minus strand and is a variant of
similarity-assisted template switching that operates during viral RNA recombination 17.

To analyze SARS-CoV-2 structure (reference Wuhan strain MN908947.3), we employed CROSS 12
to predict the double- and single-stranded content of RNA genomes such as HIV-1 13. We found the
highest density of double-stranded regions in the 5’ (nucleotides 1-253), membrane M protein
(nucleotides 26523-27191), spike S protein (nucleotides 23000-24000), and nucleocapsid N protein
(nucleotides 2874-29533; Fig. 1) 26. The lowest density of double-stranded regions were observed
at nucleotides 6000-6250 and 20000-21500 and correspond to the regions between the nonstructural proteins nsp14 and nsp15 and the upstream region of the spike surface protein S (Fig. 1)
26

. In addition to the maximum corresponding to nucleotides 23000-24000, the structural content of

spike S protein shows minima at around nucleotides 20500 and 24500 (Fig. 1).
We used the Vienna method 27 to further investigate the RNA secondary structure of specific
regions identified with CROSS

13

. Employing a 100 nucleotide window centered around CROSS

maxima and minima, we found good match between CROSS scores and Vienna free energies (Fig.
1). Strong agreement is also observed between CROSS and Vienna positional entropy, indicating
that regions with the highest structural content have also the lowest structural diversity.
Our analysis suggests the presence of structural elements in SARS-CoV-2 that have evolved to
interact with specific human proteins 11. Our observation is based on the assumption that structured
regions have an intrinsic propensity to recruit proteins 14, which is supported by the fact that
structured transcripts act as scaffolds for protein assembly 15,16.

Structural comparisons reveal that the spike S region of SARS-CoV-2 is conserved among
coronaviruses
We employed CROSSalign 13 to study the structural conservation of SARS-CoV-2 in different
strains (Materials and Methods).
In our analysis, we compared the Wuhan strain MN908947.3 with around 2800 other coronaviruses
(data from NCBI) with human (Fig. 2) or other hosts (Supp. Fig. 1). When comparing SARS-CoV2 with human coronaviruses (1387 strains, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), we found that
the most conserved region falls inside the spike S genomic locus (Fig. 2). More precisely, the
conserved region is between nucleotides 23000 - 24000 and exhibits an intricate and stable

4

A. Vandelli et al. Structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2
secondary structure (RNAfold minimum free energy= -269 kcal/mol )27. High conservation of a
structured region suggests a functional activity that might be relevant for host infection.
The 3’ and 5’ of SARS-CoV-2 are highly variable in our set. However, the 3’ and 5’ are more
structured in SARS-CoV-2 than other coronaviruses (average structural content for SARS-CoV-2 =
0.56, indicating that 56% of the CROSS signal is >0, in the 5’ and 0.49 in the 3’; by contrast, other
coronaviruses have 0.49 in the 5’ and 0.42 in the 3’).

Sequence and structural comparisons among SARS-CoV-2 strains indicate conservation of
the ACE2 binding site and high variability in a region potentially interacting with sialic acids.
To better investigate the sequence conservation of SARS-CoV-2, we compared 62 strains isolated
from different countries during the pandemic (including China, USA, Japan, Taiwan, India, Brazil,
Sweden, and Australia; data from NCBI and in VIPR www.viprbrc.org; Materials and Methods).
Our analysis aims to determine the relationship between structural content and sequence
conservation.
Using Clustal W for multiple sequence alignments 28, we observed general conservation of the
coding regions (Fig. 3A). The 5’ and 3’ show high variability due to experimental procedures of the
sequencing and are discarded in this analysis 29 . One highly conserved region is between
nucleotides 23000 - 24000 in the spike S genomic locus, while sequences up- and downstream are
variable (red bars in Fig. 3A). We then used CROSSalign 13 to compare the structural content
(Materials and Methods). High variability of structure is observed for both the 5’ and 3’ and for
nucleotides between 21000 - 22000 as well as 24000 - 25000, associated with the S region (red bars
in Fig. 3A). The rest of the regions are significantly conserved at a structural level (p-value <
0.0001; Fisher’s test).
We then compared protein sequences coded by the spike S genomic locus (NCBI reference
QHD43416) and found that both sequence (Fig. 3A) and structure (Fig. 2) of nucleotides 23000 24000 are highly conserved. The region corresponds to amino acids 330-500 that contact the host
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 30 promoting infection and provoking lung injury
24,31

. By contrast, the region upstream of the binding site receptor ACE2 and located in

correspondence to the minimum of the structural profile at around nucleotides 22500-23000 (Fig. 1)

5

A. Vandelli et al. Structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2
is highly variable 32, as indicated by T-coffee multiple sequence alignments 32 (Fig. 3A). This part of
the spike S region corresponds to amino acids 243-302 that in MERS-CoV binds to sialic acids
regulating infection through cell-cell membrane fusion (Fig. 3B; see related manuscript by E.
Milanetti et al.) 10,33,34.
Our analysis suggests that the structural region between nucleotides 23000 and 24000 of Spike S
region is conserved among coronaviruses (Fig. 2) and that the binding site for ACE2 has poor
variation in human SARS-CoV-2 strains (Fig. 3B). By contrast, the region upstream, which has
propensity to bind sialic acids 10,33,34, showed poor structural content and high variability (Fig. 3B).
Analysis of human interactions with SARS-CoV-2 identifies proteins involved in viral
replication

In order to obtain insights on how the virus replicates in human cells, we predicted SARS-CoV-2
interactions with the whole RNA-binding human proteome. Following a protocol to study structural
conservation in viruses 13, we first divided the Wuhan sequence in 30 fragments of 1000 nucleotides
each moving from the 5’ to 3’ and then calculated the protein-RNA interactions of each fragment
with catRAPID omics (3340 canonical and putative RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, for a total
102000 interactions) 18. Proteins such as Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 PTBP1 (Uniprot
P26599) showed the highest interaction propensity (or Z-score; Materials and Methods) at the 5’
while others such as Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q HNRNPQ (O60506) showed the
highest interaction propensity at the 3’, in agreement with previous studies on coronaviruses (Fig.
4A) 35.
For each fragment, we predicted the most significant interactions by filtering according to the Z
score. We used three different thresholds in ascending order of stringency: Z ³ 1.50, 1.75 and 2
respectively and we removed from the list the proteins that were predicted to interact promiscuously
with more than one fragment. Fragment 1 corresponds to the 5’ and is the most contacted by RBPs
(around 120 with Z³2 high-confidence interactions; Fig. 4B), which is in agreement with the
observation that highly structured regions attract a large number of proteins 14. Indeed, the 5’
contains multiple stem loop structures that control RNA replication and transcription 36,37. By
contrast, the 3’ and fragment 23 (Spike S), which are still structured but to a lesser extent, attract
fewer proteins (10 and 5, respectively), while fragment 20 (between orf1ab and Spike S) that is
predicted to be unstructured, does not have binding partners.

The interactome of each fragment was then analysed using cleverGO, a tool for Gene Ontology
(GO) enrichment analysis 38. Proteins interacting with fragments 1, 2 and 29 were associated with
annotations related to viral processes (Fig. 4C; Supp. Table 1). Considering the three thresholds
applied (Materials and Methods), we found 22 viral proteins for fragment 1, 2 proteins for
fragment 2 and 11 proteins for fragment 29 (Fig. 4D).
Among the high-confidence interactors of fragment 1, we discovered RBPs involved in positive
regulation of viral processes and viral genome replication, such as double-stranded RNA-specific
editase 1 ADARB1 (Uniprot P78563 39), 2-5-oligoadenylate synthase 2 OAS2 (P29728) and 2-5Adependent ribonuclease RNASEL (Q05823). Interestingly, 2-5-oligoadenylate synthase 2 OAS2 has
been reported to be upregulated in human alveolar adenocarcinoma (A549) cells infected with
SARS-CoV-2 (log fold change of 4.2; p-value of 10-9 and q-value of 10-6) 40. While double-stranded
RNA-specific adenosine deaminase ADAR (P55265) is absent in our library due to its length that
does not meet catRAPID omics requirements 18, the omiXcore extension of the algorithm
specifically developed for large molecules 41 attributes the same binding propensity to both
ADARB1 and ADAR, thus indicating that the interactions might occur (Materials and Methods).
Moreover, experimental works indicate that the family of ADAR deaminases is active in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from SARS-CoV-2 patients 42 and is upregulated in A549
cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (log fold change of 0.58; p-value of 10-8 and q-value of 10-5) 40.
We also identified proteins related to the establishment of integrated proviral latency, including Xray repair cross-complementing protein 5 XRCC5 (P13010) and X-ray repair cross-complementing
protein 6 XRCC6 (P12956; Fig. 4B and 4E). In accordance with our calculations, comparison of
A549 cells responses to SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus, indicates upregulation of
XRRC6 in SARS-CoV-2 (log fold-change of 0.92; p-value of 0.006 and q-value of 0.23) 40.
Nucleolin NCL (P19338), a protein known to be involved in coronavirus processing, was also
predicted to bind tightly to the 5’ (Supp. Table 1) 43.
Importantly, we found proteins related to defence response to viruses, such as ATP-dependent RNA
helicase DDX1 (Q92499), that are involved in negative regulation of viral genome replication.
Some DNA-binding proteins such as Cyclin-T1 CCNT1 (O60563), Zinc finger protein 175 ZNF175
(Q9Y473) and Prospero homeobox protein 1 PROX1 (Q92786) were included because they could
have potential RNA-binding ability (Fig. 4E) 44. As for fragment 2, we found two canonical RBPs:

7

A. Vandelli et al. Structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2
E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM32 (Q13049) and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM21 (P19474),
which are listed as negative regulators of viral release from host cell, negative regulators of viral
transcription and positive regulators of viral entry into host cells. Among these genes, DDX1 (log
fold change of 0.36; p-value of 0.007 and q-value of 0.23) and TRIM21 (log fold change of 0.44; pvalue of 0.003 and q-value of 0.18) are the most significantly upregulated in A549 cells infected
with SARS-CoV-2 40. Finally, 10 of the 11 viral proteins detected for fragment 29 are members of
the Gag polyprotein family, that perform different tasks during HIV assembly, budding, maturation.
More than simple scaffold elements, Gag proteins are versatile elements that bind to viral and host
proteins as they traffic to the cell membrane (Supp. Table 1) 45.
Analysis of functional annotations carried out with GeneMania 46 revealed that proteins interacting
with the 5’ of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are associated with regulatory pathways involving NOTCH2,
MYC and MAX that have been previously connected to viral infection processes (Fig. 4E) 47,48.
Interestingly, some proteins, including DDX1, CCNT1 and ZNF175 for fragment 1 and TRIM32
for fragment 2, have been shown to be necessary for HIV functions and replication inside the cell.
The roles of these proteins in retroviral replication are expected to be different in SARS-CoV-2. As
SARS-CoV-2 represses host gene expression through a number of unknown mechanisms 4849,
sequestration of elements such as DDX1 and CCNT1 could be exploited to alter biological
pathways in the host cell. Supporting this hypothesis, DXX1 and CCNT1 have been shown to
condense in large ribonucleoprotein assemblies such as stress granules 50–52 that are the primary
target of RNA viruses 53. Regarding the function of these proteins in disease, DDX1 is required for
HIV-1 Rev as well as for avian coronavirus IBV replication and it binds to the RRE sequence of
HIV-1 RNAs 1–3 , while CCNT1 binds to 7SK snRNA and regulates transactivation domain of the
viral nuclear transcriptional activator, Tat 56,57.
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 proteins reveals common interactions
Recently, Gordon et al. reported a list of human proteins binding to Open Reading Frames (ORFs)
translated from SARS-CoV-2 58. Identified through affinity purification followed by mass
spectrometry quantification, 332 proteins from HEK-293T cells interact with viral ORF peptides.
By selecting 274 proteins binding at the 5’ with Z score ³1.5 (Supp. Table 1), of which 140 are
exclusively interacting with fragment 1 (Fig. 4B), we found that 8 are also reported in the list by
Gordon et al. 58, which indicates significant enrichment (representation factor of 2.5; p-value of
0.02; hypergeometric test with human proteome in background). The fact that our list of protein-

8

A. Vandelli et al. Structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2
RNA binding partners contains elements identified also in the protein-protein network analysis is
not surprising, as ribonucleoprotein complexes evolve together 14 and their components sustain each
other through different types of interactions 16.
We note that out of 332 interactions, 60 are RBPs (as reported in Uniprot 39), which represents a
considerable fraction (i.e., 20%), considering that there are around 1500 RBPs in the human
proteome (i.e., 6%) and fully justified by the fact that they involve association with viral RNA.
Comparing the RBPs present in Gordon et al. 58 and those present in our list (79 as in Uniprot), we
found an overlap of 6 proteins (representation factor = 26.5; p-value < 10-8; hypergeometric test),
including: Janus kinase and microtubule-interacting protein 1 JAKMIP1 (Q96N16), A-kinase
anchor protein 8 AKAP8 (O43823) and A-kinase anchor protein 8-like AKAP8L (Q9ULX6), which
in case of HIV-1 infection is involved as a DEAD/H-box RNA helicase binding 59, signal
recognition particle subunit SRP72 (O76094), binding to the 7S RNA in presence of SRP68, Larelated protein 7, LARP7 (Q4G0J3) and La-related protein 4B LARP4B (Q92615), which are part
of a system for transcriptional regulation acting by means of the 7SK RNP system 60 (Fig. 4F;
Supp. Table 2). Interestingly, SRP72, LARP7 and LARP4B proteins assemble in stress granules
61–63

that are the targeted by RNA viruses 53. We speculate that sequestration of these elements is

orchestrated by a viral program aiming to recruit host genes 49. LARP7 is also upregulated in A549
cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (log fold change of 0.48; p-value of 0.006 and q-value of 0.23) 40.
Moreover, by directly analysing the RNA interaction potential of all the 332 proteins by Gordon et
al. 58, catRAPID identified 38 putative binders at the 5’ (Z score ³ 1.5; 27 occurring exclusively in
the 5’ and not in other regions of the RNA) 18, including Serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1
(Q9UHD2), among which 10 RBPs (as reported in Uniprot) such as: Splicing elements U3 small
nucleolar ribonucleoprotein protein MPP10 (O00566) and Pre-mRNA-splicing factor SLU7
(O95391), snRNA methylphosphate capping enzyme MEPCE involved in negative regulation of
transcription by RNA polymerase II 7SK (Q7L2J0) 64, Nucleolar protein 10 NOL10 (Q9BSC4) and
protein kinase A Radixin RDX (P35241; in addition to those mentioned above; Supp. Table 2).
HIV-related RBPs are significantly enriched in the 5’ interactions
In the list of 274 proteins binding to the 5’ (fragment 1) with Z score ≥1.5, we found 10 hits
associated with HIV (Supp. Table 3), which represents a significant enrichment (p-value=0.0004;
Fisher’s exact test), considering that the total number of HIV-related proteins is 35 in the whole

9

A. Vandelli et al. Structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2
catRAPID library (3340 elements). The complete list of proteins includes ATP-dependent RNA
helicase DDX1 (Q92499 also involved in Coronavirus replication 54,55), ATP-dependent RNA
helicase DDX3X (O00571 also involved in Dengue and Zika Viruses), Tyrosine-protein kinase
HCK (P08631, nucleotide binding), Arf-GAP domain and FG repeat-containing protein 1 (P52594),
Double-stranded RNA-specific editase 1 ADARB1 (P78563), Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNAbinding protein 1 IGF2BP1 (Q9NZI8), A-kinase anchor protein 8-like AKAP8L (Q9ULX6; its
partner AKAP8 is also found in Gordon et al. 58) Cyclin-T1 CCNT1 (O60563; DNA-binding) and
Forkhead box protein K2 FOXK2 (Q01167; DNA-binding; Fig. 4B,E Supp. Table 3).

Smaller enrichments were found for proteins related to Hepatitis B virus (HBV; p-value=0.01; 3
hits out of 7 in the whole catRAPID library; Fisher’s exact test), Nuclear receptor subfamily 5
group A member 2 NR5A2 (DNA-binding; O00482), Interferon-induced, double-stranded RNAactivated protein kinase EIF2AK2 (P19525), and SRSF protein kinase 1 SRPK1 (Q96SB4) as well
as Influenza (p-value=0.03; 2 hits out of 4; Fisher’s exact test), Synaptic functional regulator FMR1
(Q06787) and RNA polymerase-associated protein RTF1 homologue (Q92541; Supp. Table 3). By
contrast, no significant enrichments were found for other viruses such as for instance Ebola.
Very importantly, specific chemical compounds have been developed to interact with HIV- and
HVB-related proteins. The list of HIV-related targets reported in ChEMBL 65 includes ATPdependent RNA helicase DDX1 (CHEMBL2011807), ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X
(CHEMBL2011808), Cyclin-T1 CCNT1 (CHEMBL2348842), and Tyrosine-protein kinase HCK
(CHEMBL2408778)65, among other targets. In addition, HVB-related targets are Nuclear receptor
subfamily 5 group A member 2 NR5A2 (CHEMBL3544), Interferon-induced, double-stranded
RNA-activated protein kinase EIF2AK2 (CHEMBL5785) and SRSF protein kinase 1 SRPK1
(CHEMBL4375). We hope that this list can be the starting point for further pharmaceutical studies.
Phase-separating proteins are enriched in the 5’ interactions
A number of proteins identified in our catRAPID calculations have been previously reported to
coalesce in large ribonucleoprotein assemblies such as stress granules. Among these proteins, we
found double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase EIF2AK2 (P19525), Nucleolin NCL
(P19338), ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX1 (Q92499), Cyclin-T1 CCNT1 (O60563), signal
recognition particle subunit SRP72 (O76094), LARP7 (Q4G0J3) and La-related protein 4B
LARP4B (Q92615) as well as Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 PTBP1 (P26599) and

10

A. Vandelli et al. Structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2
Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q HNRNPQ (O60506) 63. To further investigate the
propensity of these proteins to phase separate in stress granules, we used the catGRANULE
algorithm (Materials and Methods) 66 . We found that the 274 proteins binding to the 5’ (fragment
1) with Z score ≥1.5 are highly prone to accumulate in stress-granules (274 proteins with the lowest
Z score are used in the comparison; p-value<0.0001; Kolmogorov-Smirnoff; Fig. 4G; Supp. Table
4).
This finding is particularly relevant because RNA viruses are known to antagonize stress granules
formation 53. Indeed, the role of stress granules and processing bodies in translation suppression and
RNA decay have impact on virus replication 67.

CONCLUSIONS
Our study is motivated by the need to identify molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19
spreading. Using advanced computational approaches, we investigated the structural content of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA and predicted human proteins that bind to it.
We employed CROSS 13,68 to compare the structural properties of 2800 coronaviruses and identified
elements conserved in SARS-CoV-2 strains. The regions containing the highest amount of structure
are the 5’ as well as glycoproteins spike S and membrane M.
We found that the spike S protein domain encompassing amino acids 330-500 is highly conserved
across SARS-CoV-2 strains. This result suggests that spike S must have evolved to specifically
interact with its host partner ACE2 30 and mutations increasing the binding affinity are highly
infrequent. As the nucleic acids encoding for this region are enriched in double-stranded content,
we speculate that the structure might attract host regulatory elements, thus further constraining the
variability. The fact that the Spike S region is highly conserved among all the analysed SARS-CoV2 strains suggests that a specific drug can be designed against it to prevent interactions within the
host.
By contrast, the highly variable region at amino acids 243-302 in spike S protein corresponds to the
binding site of sialic acids in MERS-CoV (see manuscript by E. Milanetti et al.) 7,10,34 and could
play a role in infection 33. The fact that the binding region changes in the different strains might
indicate a variety of binding affinities for sialic acids, which could provide clues on the specific
responses in the human population. Interestingly, the sialic acid binding site is absent in SARS-CoV
but present in MERS-CoV, which represents an important difference between the diseases.
Both our sequence and structural analyses of spike S protein indicate high conservation among
coronaviruses and suggest that human engineering of SARS-CoV-2 is highly unlikely.
Using catRAPID 18,19 we computed >100000 protein interactions with SARS-CoV-2 and found
previously reported interactions such as Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 PTBP1,
Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q HNRNPQ and Nucleolin NCL 43. In addition, we
discovered that the highly structured region at the 5’ has the largest number of protein partners
including ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX1 that was previously reported to be essential for

12

A. Vandelli et al. Structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2
HIV-1 and coronavirus IBV replication 54,55, and the double-stranded RNA-specific editases
ADAR and ADARB1 that catalyse the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine 49 . Other
predicted interactions are XRCC5 and XRCC6 members of the HDP-RNP complex associating
with ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX9 69 as well as and 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease RNASEL
and 2-5-oligoadenylate synthase 2 OAS2 that control viral RNA degradation 70,71. Interestingly,
DDX1, XRCC6 and OAS2 are upregulated in human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells infected with
SARS-CoV-2 40. In agreement with our predictions, recent experimental work indicates that the
family of ADAR deaminases is active in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from SARS-CoV-2
patients 42.
A significant overlap exists with the list of protein interactions reported by Gordon et al. 58, and
among the candidate partners we identified AKAP8L, involved as a DEAD/H-box RNA helicase
binding protein involved in HIV infection 59. In general, proteins associated with retroviral
replication are expected to play different roles in SARS-CoV-2. As SARS-CoV-2 massively
represses host gene expression 49, we hypothesize that the virus hijacks host pathways by recruiting
transcriptional and post-transcriptional elements interacting with polymerase II genes and splicing
factors such as for instance A-kinase anchor protein 8-like AKAP8L and La-related protein 7
LARP7 that is upregulated in human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 40.
The link to proteins previously studied in the context of HIV and other viruses, if further confirmed
fro, is particularly relevant for the repurposing of existing drugs 65.
The idea that SARS-CoV-2 sequesters different elements of the transcriptional machinery is
particularly intriguing and is supported by the fact that a large number of proteins identified in our
screening are found in stress granules 63. Indeed, stress granules protect the host innate immunity
and are hijacked by viruses to favour their own replication 67. Moreover, as coronaviruses
transcription uses discontinuous RNA synthesis that involves high-frequency recombination 43, it is
possible that pieces of the viruses resulting from a mechanism called defective interfering RNAs 72
could act as scaffold to attract host proteins 14,15.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Structure prediction
We predicted the secondary structure of transcripts using CROSS (Computational Recognition of
Secondary Structure 13,68. CROSS was developed to perform high-throughput RNA profiling. The
algorithm predicts the structural profile (single- and double-stranded state) at single-nucleotide
resolution using sequence information only and without sequence length restrictions (scores > 0
indicate double stranded regions). We used the Vienna method 27 to further investigate the RNA
secondary structure of minima and maxima identified with CROSS

13

.

Structural conservation
We used CROSSalign 13,68 an algorithm based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), to check and
evaluate the structural conservation between different viral genomes 13. CROSSalign was
previously employed to study the structural conservation of ~5000 HIV genomes. SARS-CoV-2
fragments (1000 nt, not overlapping) were searched inside other complete genomes using the OBE
(open begin and end) module, in order to search a small profile inside a larger one. The lower the
structural distance, the higher the structural similarities (with a minimum of 0 for almost identical
secondary structure profiles). The significance is assessed as in the original publication 13.
Sequence collection
The FASTA sequences of the complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from Virus
Pathogen Resource (VIPR; www.viprbrc.org), for a total of 62 strains. Regarding the overall
coronaviruses, the sequences were downloaded from NCBI selecting only complete genomes, for a
total of 2862 genomes. The reference Wuhan sequence with available annotation
(EPI_ISL_402119) was downloaded from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data. (GISAID
https://www.gisaid.org/).

Protein-RNA interaction prediction
Interactions between each fragment of target sequence and the human proteome were predicted
using catRAPID omics 18,19 , an algorithm that estimates the binding propensity of protein-RNA
pairs by combining secondary structure, hydrogen bonding and van der Waals contributions. As
reported in a recent analysis of about half a million of experimentally validated interactions 31, the
algorithm is able to separate interacting vs non-interacting pairs with an area under the ROC curve
of 0.78. The complete list of interactions between the 30 fragments and the human proteome is
available at http://crg-webservice.s3.amazonaws.com/submissions/202003/252523/output/index.html?unlock=f6ca306af0. The output then is filtered according to the Zscore column, which is the interaction propensity normalised by the mean and standard deviation
calculated over the reference RBP set (http://s.tartaglialab.com/static_files/shared/faqs.html#4). We
used three different thresholds in ascending order of stringency: Z greater or equal than 1.50, 1.75
and 2 respectively and for each threshold we then selected the proteins that were unique for each
fragment for each threshold. omiXscore calculations of ADAR and ADARB1 are interactions are
respectively at http://crg-webservice.s3.amazonaws.com/submissions/202004/263420/output/index.html?unlock=f9375fdbf9 and http://crgwebservice.s3.amazonaws.com/submissions/202004/263140/output/index.html?unlock=bb28d715ea.

GO terms analysis
cleverGO

38

, an algorithm for the analysis of Gene Ontology annotations, was used to determine

which fragments present enrichment in GO terms related to viral processes. Analysis of functional
annotations was performed in parallel with GeneMania 46.
RNA and protein alignments
We used Clustal W

28

for 62 SARS-CoV-2 strains alignments and T-Coffee

32

for spike S proteins

alignments. The variability in the spike S region was measured by computing Shannon entropy on
translated RNA sequences. The Shannon entropy is computed as follows:
S(a) = - Sum_i P(a,i) log P(a,i)

16

A. Vandelli et al. Structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2

Where a correspond to the amino acid at the position i and P(a,i) is the frequency of a certain
amino-acid a at position i of the sequence. Low entropy indicates poorly variability: if P(a,x) = 1 for
one a and 0 for the rest, then S(x) =0. By contrast, if the frequencies of all amino acids are equally
distributed, the entropy reaches its maximum possible value.
Predictions of phase separation
catGRANULE 66 was employed to identify proteins assembling into biological condensates. Scores
> 0 indicate that a protein is prone to phase separate. Structural disorder, nucleic acid binding
propensity and amino acid patterns such as arginine-glycine and phenylalanine-glycine are key
features combined in this computational approach 66.

, we studied the structural content of SARS-CoV-2. We

found the highest density of double-stranded regions in the 5’ (nucleotides 1-253), membrane M
protein (nucleotides 26523-27191), and the spike S protein (nucleotides 23000-24000). Strong
match is observed between CROSS and Vienna analyses (centroid structures shown), indicating
that regions with the highest structural content have the lowest free energies.
Fig. 2. We employed the CROSSalign approach 13,68 to compare the Wuhan strain MN908947 with
other coronaviruses (1387 strains, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) indicates that the most

variability (positional entropy) within regions encompassing nucleotides 23000-24000 along with
the centroid structure and free energy.

conservation (Clustal W multiple sequence alignments 38) is observed in coding regions, including
the region between nucleotides 23000 and 24000 of spike S protein. High structural variability (red
bars on top) is observed for both the UTRs and for nucleotides between 21000 and 22000 as well as
24000 and 25000, associated with the S region. The rest of the regions are significantly conserved
at a structural level. (B) The sequence variability (Shannon entropy computed on T-Coffee multiple
sequence alignments 32) in the spike S protein indicate conservation between amino-acids 460 and
520 (blue box) binding to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ACE2. The region
encompassing amino-acids 243 and 302 is highly variable and is implicated in sialic acids in
MERS-CoV (red box). The S1 and S2 domains of Spike S protein are displayed.
