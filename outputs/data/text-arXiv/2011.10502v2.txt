Abstract—When should restrictive measures be taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic explosion? An important role
for interpreting the pandemic data in a fully rational manner,
and thus proactively supporting the political decision makers,
is played by signal processing tools. In this paper, we exploit
quickest-detection theory applied to pandemic time-series to
predict the explosion of COVID-19 infection on a large scale.
The focus of the work is to develop a version of the celebrated
Page’s CUSUM test, specifically tailored to pandemic data. Its
application to the publicly-available sequence of new positive
individuals per day from different countries is briefly illustrated.

of the pandemic explosion. With this aim, we consider an
abbreviated observation model, built on the basic concept
that the pandemic evolution is essentially a multiplicative
phenomenon.
We model the number of new positive individuals on day n,
say pn , as the number pn−1 of new positive individuals on
day n − 1, multiplied by a random variable xn . Further
including a “noise” term wn , yields the scalar discrete-time
state equation
pn = pn−1 xn + wn ,

I. I NTRODUCTION
The outbreak of the COVID-19 infection is certainly one
of the most serious global crises of the last two decades.
To contain the “first wave” of the COVID-19 pandemic in
the spring of 2020, strict lockdown was imposed in many
countries, with huge societal and economic costs [1]–[6]. In
the fall of 2020, a “second pandemic wave” seems to be
growing in many regions of the world, and governments and
authorities are again faced with the dilemma of if and when to
impose social restrictions. Signal processing tools, and more
specifically quickest-detection theory [7]–[9], may provide
valuable support to make informed and rational decisions.
In this article, we develop a version of the Page’s CUSUM
quickest-detection procedure [10]–[13], specifically tailored
to pandemic COVID-19 time-series. The proposed test is
called MAST, an acronym for mean-agnostic sequential test.
Application of MAST to pandemic data is discussed in [14],
see also [15]; a related analysis is provided in [16]. In this
document, we focus on the derivation of the test.
Starting from the landmark SIR model developed in [17], a
multitude of sophisticated epidemiological models have been
proposed, based, e.g., on stochastic evolution of epidemic
compartments [18]–[22], or metapopulation networks, [23],
[24], just to cite two examples. The trend in the topical
literature is to conceive increasingly complex models, often
suitable for analysis by big-data techniques. The main goal
of these models is to predict mid/long-term evolution of the
infection. Our focus, instead, is to quickly detect the onset

for some p0 > 0. In this article, we refer to model (2), in which
x1 , x2 , . . . are independent random variables. This is akin to
the popular random walk model, with the difference that the
independence of the increments of the random walk is replaced
with the independence of the ratios pn /pn−1 . Model (2) has
been derived from SIR-like models and validated on COVID19 pandemic data in [14], where it is also shown that the
xn ’s closely follow a Gaussian distribution with (unknown)
time-varying expected value Exn , and a common standard
deviation2 σ.
As long as Exn < 1, the sequence {pn } tends to decrease
exponentially fast, while, for Exn > 1, {pn } tends to increase
exponentially fast. We are interested in quickly detecting the
passage from the former situation (a controlled regime) to the
latter (critical). Detecting this change of regime can be cast in
terms of a binary decision problem between two hypotheses,
referred to as the null and the alternative, as discussed next.
II. Q UICKEST D ETECTION OF PANDEMIC O NSET
Along the same lines of the derivations of Page’s test, see
e.g., [11, Sec. 2.2.3] or [28, Sec. 8.2], we consider the following decision problem involving two statistical hypotheses
with independent data:
null :
alternative :

xk ∼ N (µ0,k , σ),
k = 1, . . . , n,
(
xk ∼ N (µ0,k , σ), k = 1, . . . , j − 1,
xk ∼ N (µ1,k , σ), k = j, . . . , n.

(3)

1 The same multiplicative structure shown in (2) applies, other than p , to
n
different time-series related to the pandemic evolution, e.g., the number of
new hospitalizations per day [14].
2 Since σ ≪ 1 and Ex ≈ 1, P(x < 0) is negligible, for all n. Thus,
n
n
one can safely assume that {xn } is a sequence of independent nonnegative
random variables.

2

In (3), {xk }nk=1 are the data available to the decision maker,
1 ≤ j ≤ n + 1 is an unknown deterministic change time and
the standard deviation σ is assumed known. Note in (3) that in
the case j = n + 1, the alternative hypothesis is equivalent to
the null one, i.e., there is no change in regime. Different from
the classical assumption of Page’s test, in our problem, the
expected values before and after the change are unavailable.
Accordingly, we model {µ0,k }nk=1 and {µ1,k }nk=1 as unknown
deterministic sequences and we assume that they satisfy the
following constraints:
µ0,k ≤ δℓ ,

0 < δℓ ≤ δu < ∞.

µ1,k > δu ,

0 < δℓ ≤ δu < ∞,

µ1 > δ u ,

(5)

in place of (4). In some sense, this might be more natural, since
the mean levels before and after the change are still assumed
unknown, but are merely constant. However, formulation (5)
does not admit a recursive Page-like procedure whereas MAST
that results from (4) does.

Thus, model (3) contains 2n + 1 unknown parameters: the
index of change j and the two sequences of the expected
values. In (4), the most natural choice is δℓ = δu = 1,
but it is convenient to consider the general case having an
implied hysteresis. For example, δu may be specified based
on tolerable time to reach hospital capacity, while δℓ may be
specified based on time people can endure restrictions before
reopening the economy or tolerable level of positive cases.
One might also consider
µ0 ≤ δ ℓ ,

This yields the GLRT statistic in the form

or, equivalently, taking the logarithm:
Tn (δℓ , δu ) =

max T j:n (δℓ , δu ),

The passage from the controlled to the critical regime is
declared at the smallest n such that
Tn (δℓ , δu ) > γ,

(12)

where the threshold level γ is selected to trade-off decision
delay and risk, two quantities that will be defined in Sec. III.
The test in (12) will be referred to as MAST(δℓ , δu ) with
boundaries δℓ and δu . The subscript n appended to Tn (δℓ , δu )
denotes its dependence on the stream of data x1 , . . . , xn ,
and the subscript j : n appended to T j:n (δℓ , δu ) denotes its
dependence on xj , . . . , xn . Finally, by introducing the nonlinearity

we have T j:n (δℓ , δu ) = k=j g(xk ; δℓ , δu ).
As a sanity check, let us assume that values of xk closer to
δℓ are confused with δℓ and, likewise, values of xk closer
to δu are confused with δu . Then, we see from (11) that
the contribution to T j:n (δℓ , δu ) provided by the sample xk is
±(δu −δℓ )2 /2σ 2 , where the negative sign applies to the former
case and the positive one to the latter. In the actual operation
of T j:n (δℓ , δu ), the contribution given by the sample xk is
regulated by its distance to the boundaries, as shown in (13):
•

•

values xk ≤ δℓ give a negative contribution proportional
to the square of the distance of xk from the upper
boundary δu ;
values δℓ ≤ xk < δu give a linear contribution, whose
sign depends on which boundary xk is closest to;
values xk > δu give a positive contribution proportional
to the square of the distance of xk from the lower
boundary δℓ .

(15)

We have thus arrived at a recursive expression for the decision
statistic: T0 (δℓ , δu ) = 0 and, for n ≥ 1, Tn (δℓ , δu ) =
g(xn ; δℓ , δu ) + Tn−1 (δℓ , δu ), if g(xn ; δℓ , δu ) + Tn−1 (δℓ , δu ) ≥
0, and Tn (δℓ , δu ) = 0, otherwise. Equivalently: T0 (δℓ , δu ) = 0,
and, for n ≥ 1,


Tn (δℓ , δu ) = max 0, Tn−1 (δℓ , δu ) + g(xn ; δℓ , δu ) . (16)
We now consider two special cases. First, let δℓ = δu = δ,
a case referred to as the MAST(δ) detector, with decision
statistic T0 (δ) = 0 and, for n ≥ 1,



Tn (δ) = max 0, Tn−1 (δ) +

Further assuming δ = 1 in (17), yields a decision procedure
that we simply call MAST, whose decision statistic Tn (1) is
denoted by Tn : T0 = 0 and, for n ≥ 1,


(xn − 1)2
Tn = max 0, Tn−1 +
sign(xk − 1) .
(18)
2σ 2
The second special case is when δℓ = 1−α and δu = 1+α,
for some 0 < α < 1, which is relevant in connection to Page’s
test, as discussed next. As is well-known, if the mean values of
the observed sequence before and after the change are constant
and known, say µ0,n = 1 − α and µ1,n = 1 + α, the statistic
to be compared to a suitable threshold level would be the
CUSUM [10]–[12]: Q0 = 0 and, for n ≥ 1,

σ2
For 1 − α ≤ xk ≤ 1 + α, Eq. (13) gives g(xk ; 1 − α, 1 + α) =
2α
σ2 (xk − 1), which shows that the decision statistic Tn (1 −
α, 1+α) in (14) operates exactly as the Page’s test for samples
xk ∈ [1 − α, 1 + α].
The test based on (19) is the optimal quickest-detection
Page’s test. Different optimality criteria have been advocated

for the Page’s CUSUM test. The “first-order” criterion considers the asymptotic situation in which the mean time between
false alarms goes to infinity and asserts that the CUSUM
minimizes the worst-case mean delay, where the qualification
“worst” refers to both the change time and the behavior of the
process before change [11, p. 166]. The asymptotic setting
is appropriate in the analysis of pandemic data, because one
wants to ensure very small false alarm rates.
It is worth noting that the MAST statistic in (18) is formally
obtained by replacing the unknown value of α appearing in
the CUSUM statistic, with an estimate α
bn = |xn −1| (constant
factors can be incorporated in the threshold). This suggests an
analogy between MAST for quickest-detection problems and
the energy detector for testing the presence of an unknown
time-varying deterministic signal buried in Gaussian noise, in
the classical hypothesis testing framework [29].
III. P ERFORMANCE A SSESSMENT
The performance of MAST(δℓ , δu ) is expressed in terms
of mean delay time ∆ and false alarm probability Pf . The
mean delay ∆ is the difference between the time at which
the MAST(δℓ , δu ) statistic Tn (δℓ , δu ) crosses a preassigned
threshold level γ, see (12), and the time of passage from
the controlled to the critical regime. In the critical regime,
the pandemic grows exponentially fast and it is therefore
important to ensure that ∆ is as small as possible. This
requirement is in contrast with the requirement Pf ≪ 1. The
false alarm probability Pf is defined as the reciprocal of the
mean time between two false alarms3 . In turn, the mean time
between false alarms is the mean time between two threshold
crossings, assuming that the decision statistic is reset to zero
at any threshold crossing event, occurring in the controlled
regime. Because of the huge social and economic impact of the
measures presumably taken by the authorities when passage
into the critical regime is detected, it is evident that Pf must
be extremely small. The same performance indices ∆ and Pf
used to characterize MAST(δℓ , δu ) are used for the Page’s test.
We now investigate the performance of MAST(δℓ , δu ) by
computer experiments, limiting the analysis to the case δℓ =
δu = 1, i.e., the simple MAST. The performance of the Page’s
test is used as a benchmark. Let us consider the following
“scenario 0”. Fix α > 0. Suppose that the state of nature
(mean value of the xn ’s) is µ0,n = 1 − α for all n in the
controlled regime; likewise, suppose µ1,n = 1 + α for all n
in the critical regime. By standard Monte Carlo counting, for
MAST we found that the delay ∆ varies almost linearly with
the threshold level γ, and that log10 Pf varies almost linearly
with γ. The same approximate behavior is found, again by
standard Monte Carlo counting, for the clairvoyant Page’s test
that is aware of the mean values µ0,n = 1−α and µ1,n = 1+α:
the mappings γ 7→ ∆ and γ 7→ log10 Pf are approximately
linear. These numerical analyses are not detailed for the sake
of brevity. The observed behavior is known for the Page’s
test, at least when the threshold γ is sufficiently large, in view
of the Wald’s approximation, see, e.g. [11, Eq. 5.2.44]. In
3 Note that in a quickest detection application the concept of a “false alarm”
is different from that in a fixed-block test.

Fig. 1. Operational characteristic (false alarm probability Pf versus decision
delay ∆) of the MAST quickest detection test, compared to the benchmark
Page’s test. Three scenarios are considered, as described in the main text.
In scenario 0, Page’s test is optimal. MAST outperforms Page’s test in
scenarios 1 and 2, in which the sequences {µ0,n } and {µ1,n } are timevarying. Scenario 2, in particular, mimics the actual behavior of the sequences,
as observed in COVID-19 pandemic data.

the present Gaussian case, more accurate formulas — known
as Siegmund’s approximations — are also available [11, Eqs.
5.2.64, 5.2.65].
We assume that the aforementioned linear mappings observed for MAST and Page’s test hold true for any value of
the threshold, and this assumption allows us to consider values
of the mean delay and (especially) of false alarm probability
that would be difficult to obtain by standard Monte Carlo
analysis. In this way, we obtain the operational curve of the
two decision systems shown in Fig. 1. The operational curve
is the relationship between Pf and ∆. As expected, Page’s test
outperforms the MAST, because the Page’s test is optimal for
the case addressed in scenario 0.
The same numerical analysis has been conducted for “scenario 1” and “scenario 2”, also shown in Fig. 1. In scenario 1,
we suppose that in the controlled regime, any µ0,n is an instantiation of a uniform random variable with support (1 − α, 1),
while in the critical regime any µ1,n is an instantiation of
a uniform random variable with support (1, 1 + 10 α). In
scenario 2, instead, we suppose that the sequences {µ0,k } and
{µ1,k } are sinusoidal with a period of 75 days, consistent
with the sequences obtained with the COVID-19 epidemic
data observed for different countries [14]. Specifically, in the
controlled regime the sinusoid oscillates in (1 − α, 1), while in
the critical regime it oscillates in (1, 1 + 10 α). To implement
the Page’s test in both scenarios 1 and 2, it is assumed that the
mean values are constant, i.e., µ0,n = 1 − α and µ1,n = 1 + α,
as in scenario 0. Clearly, no assumption about the mean values
is instead needed for implementing the MAST test, except
that they are bounded by one. In Fig. 1, we see that MAST
outperforms Page’s test, confirming its effectiveness when the
mean values {µ0,n } and {µ1,n } are unknown, except for being
bounded as shown in (4).
Applications of the quickest detection tool developed here to
COVID-19 pandemic data can be found in [14], see also [16]

Fig. 2. MAST decision statistic computed for 10 US states and used to
detect the onset of the COVID-19 second wave. The dashed horizontal lines
represent the smallest and largest thresholds corresponding to Pf = 10−9 ,
for the ensemble of the ten states. Curves are prolonged beyond threshold
crossing for clarity.

the MAST procedure is provided in [15]. For space reasons,
we limit ourselves to offer in Fig. 2 an example application to
the detection of the onset of the so-called COVID-19 “second
wave” (recrudescence of the contagion after a period in which
the pandemic was mostly under control) in 10 US states. In
Fig. 2, the abscissa point at which the MAST statistic crosses
the threshold represents the day at which the onset is detected.
The test threshold is state-dependent, as discussed in [14].
Then, for clarity of illustration, only the smallest and largest
thresholds corresponding to the false alarm probability Pf =
10−9 are shown, which for many states makes only a few days
difference as to the time of alert.
IV. C ONCLUSION
This article derived a sequential test called MAST, which is
used in [14], to detect passage from the controlled regime in
which the COVID-19 pandemic is restrained, to the critical
regime in which the infection spreads exponentially fast.
MAST is a variation of the celebrated Page’s test based on the
CUSUM statistic, designed for cases in which the expected
values of the data are bounded below a lower barrier δℓ
in the controlled regime, and above an upper barrier δu in
the critical one, but are otherwise unknown. We show that
MAST admits a recursive form and in the simplest case
δℓ = δu = 1, is formally obtained from the Page’s test
with nominal expected values 1 ± α, by replacing α with an
estimate thereof. The performance of MAST is investigated
by computer experiments. If the expected values of the data
are constant and known, the performance loss of MAST with
respect to the optimal Page’s test is moderate. In pandemic
scenarios, lacking knowledge of the expected values of the
data, MAST can well overcome the Page’s test designed with
nominal values of the unknowns. Finally, we would like to
stress that the domain of application of MAST goes beyond
the specific example of COVID-19 pandemic addressed here,
to cover different change-detection applications in the presence
of data uncertainty.
