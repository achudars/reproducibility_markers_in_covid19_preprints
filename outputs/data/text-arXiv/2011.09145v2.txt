Abstract—The worldwide spread of COVID-19 has
prompted extensive online discussions, creating an ‘infodemic’
on social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Twitter.
However, the information shared on these platforms is prone
to be unreliable and/or misleading. In this paper, we present
the first analysis of COVID-19 discourse on public WhatsApp
groups from Pakistan. Building on a large scale annotation of
thousands of messages containing text and images, we identify
the main categories of discussion. We focus on COVID-19
messages and understand the different types of images/text
messages being propagated. By exploring user behavior related
to COVID messages, we inspect how misinformation is spread.
Finally, by quantifying the flow of information across WhatsApp and Twitter, we show how information spreads across
platforms and how WhatsApp acts as a source for much of
the information shared on Twitter.
Keywords—COVID-19, Misinformation, WhatsApp, Twitter

I. I NTRODUCTION
Social media apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter
have changed the way we communicate. The information
disseminated through these apps has influenced our social
and cultural norms in an unprecedented way. WhatsApp is
one of the most frequently used and rapidly growing social
media apps in the world with more than 1.5 billion users.
WhatsApp is also ranked #1 for the average number of active
users in the world per month [1].
WhatsApp has, therefore, become important for understanding social behavior and opinion formation. In many
cases, the scope of the information shared in WhatsApp
groups, is limited to a community or a country [2]. Recent
studies [3] have shown that WhatsApp (like other social
media platforms) is also used for the dissemination of
misinformation. We argue that it is important to understand how this false information, either spread knowingly
(”disinformation”) or naively (”misinformation”) influences
opinion formation in different societies. This is particularly
important in the global south, where despite users having
low digital literacy, WhatsApp is the de facto mode through
which users obtain and share information [3].
With this in mind, we perform a comprehensive analysis
of COVID messages being propagated through WhatsApp
in Pakistan. Pakistan is a major developing country, with
approximately 37 million active social media users1 . Build1 https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2020-pakistan

ing on the idea of how political parties around the world [4]
are using public WhatsApp groups to reach their audience,
we start by monitoring a large sample of public WhatsApp
groups related to politics in Pakistan. Meanwhile, a major
world event occurred: On March 11, 2020, the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic [5].
Our data also holds unique value, as it encompasses noncovid groups, and gives us insight into how COVID related
content, organically gets propagated across public WhatsApp groups. Specifically, we explore the following research
questions:
RQ1: What kinds of messages, about the pandemic, are being
shared, on the publicly accessible WhatsApp groups of
Pakistan?
RQ2: Is there misinformation related to COVID-19, and if
so, to what extent and of which type?
RQ3: What is the general user behavior, and can we detect
disinformation from it?
RQ4: What is the interplay between misinformation related
to COVID-19 shared on WhatsApp and Twitter?
To explore these questions, we have collected data from
227 public WhatsApp groups starting January 10, 2020.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset and
analysis of COVID-19 related conversations from a country
in the global south, involving multiple modalities (text and
images) and multiple platforms (WhatsApp and Twitter).
We begin our investigation by analyzing the content shared
in the WhatsApp groups and filtering out the COVID-19
related content. The filtered content is then further divided
into text, images, videos,2 and other related categories.
Using this data, we make the following contributions:
• We offer the first WhatsApp dataset consisting of
discussions related to COVID-19 from Pakistan. The
dataset includes texts, images and videos originating
from 227 groups. The (anonymized) dataset will be
made publicly available to the community.
• We show using extensive manual annotation that
around 14% of the messages related to COVID-19 had
misinformation about the pandemic.
• We perform a temporal analysis of misinformation
related to COVID-19 propagation, across WhatsApp
and Twitter, exploring how content is copied across.
2 In this study, we focus on text and images, leaving video analysis for
future work.

C. Our Work’s Novelty
To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any
work analyzing COVID3 related discussions on WhatsApp.
Since WhatsApp is arguably the most frequently used application in the world, it is important to study it to see
how people are using the platform during the pandemic
and how the platform facilitates the spread of COVID19 misinformation. Although prior work has focused on
misinformation spread via WhatsApp in Brazil and India,
we are the first one to study misinformation on WhatsApp
during a major pandemic. Furthermore, our analysis is
focused on Pakistan, which has a thriving Muslim religious
identity, which allows us to see how religion plays a role
in the context of public health. In contrast to the majority
of prior work on misinformation, which focuses on textual
analysis, we also provide a detailed analysis of images
related to COVID-19 and study the information spread
across WhatsApp and Twitter both for text messages as well
as images.

A. (Mis)Information on WhatsApp
WhatsApp has been a source of major political misinformation and propaganda campaigns [6], [7]. Political parties
have invested heavily in social media strategies by creating
WhatsApp groups to reach WhatsApp users [8]. Surveys
done in India and Brazil show that at least one in six users
are part of one such public political WhatsApp group [9],
[4].
Garimella et al. [10] provide tools to collect and analyze public WhatsApp group data at scale. Making use
of these tools, various studies have shown the extent of
misinformation and manipulation on WhatsApp [11], [12],
[13], [14]. Particularly, Resende et al. [12] analyze doctored
images to fuel smear campaigns against political rivals
and the dissemination of misinformation through WhatsApp
groups in Brazil. Garimella et al. [14] provide an analysis
of image-based misinformation spread during the 2019
Indian elections and show that over 13% of the images
contained misinformation. Melo et al. [15] provide a system
for gathering analyzing, and visualizing WhatsApp public
group data for identification of misinformation propagated
in three countries: India, Brazil and Indonesia. Maros et
al. [16] analyze audio messages shared on WhatsApp and
characterize their propagation dynamics. The analysis is
performed on 20K audio messages from 330 WhatsApp
public groups and the results suggest that the audio messages
with misinformation spread further more than the benign or
unchecked audio messages.

III. M ETHODOLOGY
In this section, we delineate our data collection & annotation methodology, and discuss the related ethical issues.
A. Data Collection
WhatsApp allows its users to create public and private
groups. The public groups can be joined by any user of
the platform, typically through an invite URL of the form
chat.whatsapp.com/*. These URLs are frequently shared via
other social web platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) to invite
third parties to join.
Selection of groups. To compile a list of relevant public
groups, we looked for chat.whatsapp.com links on Facebook
and Google to find group invite URLs. We specifically
targeted the popular political parties of Pakistan as these
groups tend to be more active and give an idea of the
political sphere. Hence, “WhatsApp” along with political
parties’ names and slogans were used to search for public
groups.
Based on the above parameters, we compiled a list of
282 public WhatsApp groups. In order to ensure the quality
of groups, we manually discarded groups that were unrelated. For instance, if a group’s profile picture, group name
or bio did not contain any relevant information (political
aims/motivations) then it was removed. We further removed
groups which were buying and selling things, and did not
have any organic interactions/messages. This left us with
227 public groups, on which the analysis was done.
In order to find these groups, a set of queries, search
engines and filters were used. These queries can be found
at https://cutt.ly/8yXhxBd. We also plan to release our
anonymised dataset once the paper is accepted to encourage
further research on WhatsApp data from Pakistan.
WhatsApp data collection. To join and get data from the
groups, we used tools provided by Garimella et al. [10],
which uses the Selenium Web Driver to automate the joining
of the groups. WhatsApp stores all message data on the
user’s device in an encrypted SQLite database. We used
a rooted Android device to obtain the decryption key and

B. Health (Mis)Information
A major focus of this paper is understanding the spread
of health misinformation related to COVID-19. WhatsApp
has been a major source of health misinformation especially
during the pandemic [17]. This misinformation ranges from
highlighting wrong symptoms to ineffective treatments. Jin
et al. [18] reported a massive wave of misinformation
on social media, especially on Twitter during the Ebola
pandemic in Africa. More comprehensive details on how
fake news about Ebola on social media applications is
explored in [19].
With the ongoing surge in the COVID-19 pandemic a
wealth of misinformation has already been documented.
Sharma et al. [20] provide a dashboard for analyzing
misinformation about COVID-19 on Twitter. They analyze
25 million tweets and provide a country-wise sentiment
analysis of how people are reacting to COVID-19. Singh
et al. [21] analyze Twitter-based misinformation about
COVID-19 and provide insights on how the propagation
of misinformation on social media is connected to the rise
in the number of COVID-19 positive cases. Kouzy et al.
[22] analyze Twitter-based misinformation about COVID19 and report that tweets having the keyword “COVID19” contains less misinformation and tweets with keywords
“2019-ncov” and “Corona”. Cinelli et al. [23] provide a
comprehensive analysis of the use of different social media
platforms in the COVID-19 pandemic. They analyze Twitter,
Instagram, YouTube, Reddit and Gab, providing a review
of how the discourse on these applications is evolving.
They also explore the propagation of misinformation from
different questionable sources in social media.

3 For brevity, we refer to COVID-19 simply as COVID and use these
terms interchangably

and extracted the decrypted database every week. The media
content, which is stored as encrypted URLs was downloaded
locally and decrypted using a public tool4 (slightly modified
for our convenience). WhatsApp deletes media content from
their servers after a certain amount of time. As a result,
when decrypting media files, we missed a small subset of
the content shared (14%). The joining of the groups took
place over a 1 month period, as new groups were being
identified. The data collection started from 10 January 2020
onward and continued until 23 February 2020. We have
complete data from all groups from the end of February
until the second week of April. The details of the dataset
are summarized in Table I.

C. Identifying COVID-19 Images
As we see in Table I, around 25% of the content is
images. Hence, solely evaluating text would give a distorted
view of the overall information landscape. Naturally, image
content is far harder to automatically categorize. Therefore,
to extract images discussing COVID-19, manual tagging was
performed
Two annotators tagged a total of 6,699 images, ranging
from 16 March to 9 April, 2020. An image was declared as
COVID related if it had any of the following attributes:
1) Contained Coronavirus, COVID-19, or any other related terminology in Urdu or English.
2) Information relating to a lockdown or any restrictions
being imposed/relaxed by the government on business
or public/private institutions.
3) Sharing of any precautionary measures like prayers
for protection from disease, herbal medications, etc.
4) Contained any references to the environmental or
economic impact of COVID-19.
5) Contained people with personal protective equipment,
possible quarantine centers, and people practicing or
encouraging social distancing.
An inter annotator agreement score of 98% was observed.
In cases of a conflict, the annotators were allowed to
mutually discuss and agree upon a label. A total of 2,309
(34.5%) images were identified as COVID related, while
4,390 (65%) were identified as non-COVID images. For
context, Figure 2 shows the percentage of COVID related
images over time. We see that, as the pandemic intensifies,
so does the fraction of related images.

Twitter data. To compare the data we obtained from the
WhatsApp groups to other open, well studied social media
platforms, we also gathered data from Twitter. Specifically, we obtained historical Twitter data on an extensive
list of hashtags specific to COVID-19 in Pakistan such
as #CovidPakistan, #CoronaFreePakistan5 and other local
Twitter trend variations. This gave us 800,000 tweets.
Ethics note. The groups joined, had been openly propagated on Facebook, Twitter, and other mediums and can
be joined by anyone. The profile bio of our WhatsApp
account declares that we are collecting information for
research purposes. We also anonymized the user data, before
analyzing it.

B. Identifying COVID-19 Text Messages
We extract COVID-19 related text messages using a
keyword-filtering approach. We utilize [24], which offers
a dictionary of COVID-19 English keywords. We added
small variations and multiple spellings to the dictionary to
capture a wide variety of content related to the pandemic.
We translated these keywords into Urdu and used both
the English and Urdu keywords to search our dataset. The
final list includes keywords such as “corona”, “coronavirus”,
“covid-19”, “covid”, “covid19”, and “corona virus”, among
others. This keyword based approach results in a high
precision yet low recall method to identify COVID related
messages. Using this approach, we obtained 5,039 COVID
related text messages between March 16, 2020 and April
09, 2020. Figure 1 compares the number of daily COVID19 related and Non-COVID-19 related text messages in our
dataset.

content where people are distributing Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE), social media requests to
follow/subscribe, contact information of NGO’s, donation requests, etc.

In this section, we answer our first research question,
to understand what types of COVID related information is
being shared on WhatsApp. We first annotate the data into
5 overalapping categories and then use these categories to
understand the types of information.

Information

A. Message Type Categorization
In order to further characterize the types of COVID-19
related content being shared within our WhatsApp groups,
we categorized the COVID related text and images manually into the five categories: Information, Misinformation,
Jokes/Satire, Religious, and Ambiguous. The categories were
chosen based on a preliminary manual exploration of the
COVID-19 content. The categories are not mutually exclusive and as a result, a single message (text/image) can belong
to multiple categories. We describe each category below:
1) Information: This category consists of WhatsApp
content that contains either factual News or COVID
related facts. News reports are fact checked using
Poynter’s COVID Facts database6 which contains all
of the falsehoods detected by a large number of fact
checking organizations. In addition, AFP Pakistan
Fact Check7 is used to verify news articles. The
contents of the text or image are evaluated against
the falsehoods in the database to verify their validity.
Google search was also used to verify certain claims
not present in the Poynter dataset. If the news is
reported by a reputed news source, then it is labelled
as “Information”. A news source is considered reputed
if it has a satellite news channel or newspaper at a
national level. COVID related facts are verified using
WHO’s COVID Information and pervalent myths.8
2) Misinformation: This category is the inverse of the
above ‘Information’ category. Any content which is
either verified to be misinformation or could not
be verified as credible information is placed in this
category. Content was checked using Poynter COVIDFacts and Falsehoods database, AFP Pakistan and
WHO’s COVID Informations and COVID Myths.
3) Jokes/Satire: This class consists of content that intends to poke fun at the COVID-19 pandemic itself or
any COVID related government/political actions using
sarcasm, satire or memes. It also contains content that
consists of non-factual opinions/analysis regarding
current COVID related events or government actions.
4) Religious: Since Pakistan has a 98% Muslim population, religion plays an important role in information
dissemination. A religious theme in content is identified by looking for (i) references to spiritual texts, (ii)
quotes of religious scholars (called Maulana, Mufti,
or Sheikh), and (iii) mentions of religious acts such as
prayer, fasting etc.
5) Ambiguous: If the content does not have enough
information to be classified into one or more of the
above categories, it is then assigned to the ‘Ambiguous’ category. This category mainly consists of

Figure 3: Percentage of COVID-19 images (Light Green),
texts (Medium Green) and texts + images (Dark Green) for
each category. Notably, 14% of the total messages were
labeled to be misinformation.
Note that to maintain consistency in annotation quality
between images and text (images were annotated by two
annotators whereas text was done by only one annotator),
we randomly sampled 25% of the 5,039 COVID-19 related
texts, and validated the annotation. We showed the 25%
random sample of messages to one additional annotator
and measured the agreement with the original annotator.
We find an 82% agreement between the two annotators,
with one or more common labels counted as an agreement
for our non-mutually exclusive classes. The majority of
disagreements were between Information, Jokes/Satire and
Religious classes. This is because a lot of texts contain
different proportions of the three. Very few disagreements
were observed when one of the annotators tagged a text
as Misinformation, which were resolved after a discussion
between the two annotators.
B. Message Type Analysis
We now analyze the different types of COVID-19 related
content, in both texts and images on WhatsApp, based on the
above annotation. We have a total of 5,039 texts and 2,309
images which discuss COVID related information between
March 16 and April 9, 2020. The overall distribution of texts
and images into the COVID-19 related content categories
are shown in Figure 3. A majority of the content is simple
information (29%), containing news articles, latest government actions and health information related to COVID19. This is followed by religious content (25%). The large
amount of religious content emphasizes the importance of
religious sentiment within the society, especially during
times of uncertainty created by the pandemic. Religious
scholars and Holy Verses from religious books were cited in
these messages. Religious content was also event focused.
For instance, a ban on congregational prayers and the
rigorous COVID testing of a group of religious people on
a proselytising trip resulted in messages criticising these
government actions.
This was followed by Jokes/Satire representing 17% of
the messages. Political actions by rival parties, and government officials were frequently ridiculed and mocked,
including personally targeted attacks. For instance, many

of such texts were against government action of opening
the border with Iran, blaming the officials for bringing
Corona to Pakistan. Interestingly, a non trivial amount
(14%) was Misinformation, which shows that one in seven
messages shared contained some misleading information.
This included fake news reporting deaths of politicians, fake
quotes from famous personalities and international figures,
or fake COVID origin stories. We show detailed analysis of
misinformation in Section V.
Finally, a small fraction of messages (12%) were labelled
“Ambigious”. Among these, a significant portion of texts
contained Facebook and YouTube follow/subscribe requests
to COVID related pages and channels, donation requests, or
shared contact information for COVID-affected and povertystricken people. We also found some images depicting
quarantine centers, hospitals, doctors, and patients, which
did not fit into the above categories due to the lack of
context.

C. Lifetime of Messages
In this section, we try to understand the impact of the
various types of COVID messages on WhatsApp. To do
so, we analyzed the lifetime of various types of COVID
related messages. The lifetime of a message is the difference
between the last and first appearance of a message (in
hours) in our dataset. First, we grouped together perceptually
similar images using a popular, state of the art image hashing
tool from Facebook known as PDQ hashing.9 The hashes
were generated for all the COVID related images and then
instances of similar images were clustered together by using
Hamming distance, with a threshold of 70%, between the
hashes. The difference between first and last appearance of
a representative image in each cluster was considered as the
lifetime of that image. For texts, exact string matching was
used to find the first and last appearance of a text. Table
II shows the mean lifetime of messages belonging to the
various COVID-19 content categories.
Each category exhibits distinct mean and variance measure for lifetime. The most short lived messages belong to
the “Jokes/Satire” category. This appears logically coherent
since jokes, opinions and satirical texts are generally dictated
by events and die out quickly as the public focus shifts from
one event to another. Interestingly, the lifetime of a message
containing misinformation is quite high, for both text (7 hrs)
and images (5.5 hrs), especially compared to the Information
category. This means that misinformation tends to persist
longer compared to information, which supports existing
studies showing similar results [25], [14]. Given that WhatsApp is a closed platform with no content moderation or
third party fact checking, the fact that misinformation tends
to stick around longer might be expected, but might also be
problematic when compared to other social networks, where
eventually corrections can be issued.

Fake News. The most frequent form of COVID related
misinformation is in the form of fake news with 45% of
misinformation texts. This includes fake news pertaining to
COVID positive tests and COVID related deaths of world
figures such as Ivanka Trump, Prince Williams and even the
current Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan. Conspiracy
theories about Bill Gates intending to place RFID chips in
people to track COVID-19 were also seen. Ironically, fake
news were also observed regarding a doctored government
action announcing ‘Punishment for Spreading Fake News
on social media’.
Fake Origins. The second most prevalent form of COVID19 related misinformation is claiming fake origin stories
for the virus with 22% of the misinformation texts. Fake
origin stores include a Corona named lake in Kazakhstan
from which the virus came to being grown in a lab in

V. RQ2: COVID-19 M ISINFORMATION
In this section, we specifically look at misinformation
posts, and characterize the types of misinformation shared
on WhatsApp. We first categorize the types of misinformation based on reports from popular fact checking
organizations and then base our characterization on this
categorization.

We use “UpSet”10 plots, to visualize user behavior, where
every set is a unique user. The bottom matrix (combination
matrix) of Figure 6,7 shows the intersections of the sets
across COVID categories, while the bars on the top indicate
the number of users (sets) within that intersection. The bars
on the left indicate total users (sets) within a given category.

China or United States. A few Hollywood movies, namely
‘Contagion’, ‘Resident Evil’ and ‘I am Legend’ along with
the book ‘The Eye of Darkness’ were frequently mentioned
stating that COVID-19 had been predicted by them.
Fake Remedies. Making up roughly 20% of the misinformation, this type contains bogus remedies and treatments
such as the 1-minute breath hold test to detect COVID, and
various items like basil seeds, gargling with salt or garlic
water, honey lemon tea and even Hepatitis-C medicine as
cures to COVID-19.

A. Text Sharing Trends
The UpSet plot in Figure 6 is plotted against the text
messages shared by individual users. If we observe the combination matrix, we observe that users are sharing textual
content belonging to single category. The most exclusively
shared category is “Ambigous”. It can be attributed to
the users that join WhatsApp groups intending to share
advertisements and call-for-donations only. The second and
third highest intersection sets are for “Religious” and “Misinformation” being shared exclusively. This deviates from
the trend observed for Images. People are more likely to
exclusively share “Texts” containing “Misinformation” as
compared to “Images” containing “Misinformation”. This
prompts for need for more research in finding traces of
disinformation within text messages.

Vaccine Myths. The fake origin stories were sometimes
accompanied with claims of the vaccine already being developed and being used as an economic leverage. Countries
such as Israel, China and United States were mentioned
with claims of the vaccine already developed. This category
makes up around 6% of the misinformation texts.
Weather Myths. Four percent of the misinformation claims
that the virus can not survive in winter, summer or rainy
seasons and the outbreak would die down on its own.

Intersection Size

Flu Comparison. Only 2% of the misinformation attempted
to downplay the symptoms and severity of the disease
by comparison to the common seasonal flu. Even though
this narrative was popular elsewhere (e.g. US), it did not
have much salience in Pakistan, with the general public
acknowledging COVID-19 as a distinct and more dangerous
disease as compared to the common flu.

The temporal properties of the various categories of
misinformation are analyzed in table III. For each message,
we compute the lifetime as the difference between its last
and first occurance. The ‘Fake News’ category has the
shortest lifespan as evidenced by the lowest mean of 4 hrs.
This seems to be consistent with the hypothesis that event
triggered content is short-lived, with similar properties to the
‘Jokes/Satire’ category of COVID-19 related textual content.
The highest lifespan is for the ‘Fake Remedies’ category
with a mean life of 10 hrs, which is significantly larger
than other major categories. This indicates that content that
is not tethered to a social event is more likely to being in
circulation on a social media platform like WhatsApp.

Figure 7: UpSet plot for users posting COVID related
images. Only the top 15 intersection sets are visualized. A
lot of users are sharing information and religious content,
whereas some share misinformation.

B. Image Sharing Trends
The UpSet plot shown in Figure 7 is made against the
type of Images individual users are sharing. It is good to
see that the majority of users are sharing correct information
about the pandemic. An encouraging trend is that users

VI. RQ3:U SER B EHAVIOUR A NALYSIS
Every WhatsApp group has two types of users: (1) producers and (2) consumers. Some users share and post messages whereas others silently observe. In general, producers
are few and consumers are many (Table I). In this section,
by examining the user behavior, we hope to understand if
there is any deliberate spread of disinformation.

are not exclusively sharing misinformation, rather a mix of
content is being shared. Only 37 users exclusively shared
misinformation, whereas 67 users shared a mix of content,
along with misinformation.
To further understand if there is disinformation, we tried
to see if a specific type of image is being spread more
than others. Using the clusters we already had, made via
PDQ hashing and Hamming distance, clusters having misinformation were identified. The number of images within
these clusters are a good indicator of the impact of given
misinformation on the network. 23 unique images were
shared more than 1 times and only 8 were shared more
than 5 times.
This implies that even if we consider the images shared
multiple times to be disinformation, the quantity of disinformation is very low. Hence we believe, the misinformation
is, rather than being an organized effort, is mainly being
spread due to lack of awareness.

Lifetime (days)

Figure 8: CDFs of life of an image, along with content type,
as seen on Twitter. Twitter tends to hold a message alive for
a coupe of days. A healthy trend is that Information tends
to live the longest on Twitter.

VII. RQ4: C ROSS N ETWORK I NFORMATION S PREAD
Finally, we answer how information flows between WhatsApp and Twitter. Given that each social network has
different properties (closed vs. open), affordances (e.g.,the
ability to see how popular a content is with retweet/like
count) and user bases, such a comparison is interesting.

networks) which does not exist on WhatsApp, where the
social popularity signals like retweet or like counts are
shown.
Compared to the other categories, misinformation on
Twitter tends to die quicker. Figure 8 shows a CDF of
the lifespan of the various categories of images on Twitter.
We see that most types last at most a day, with most
having a long tail lasting weeks. This is very different from
the pattern we observed on WhatsApp, where on average,
most images lasted only a few hours. Images containing
information have a much higher lifetime, which is also in
stark contrast to what we observed on WhatsApp.
The difference in longevity of a message, as seen in
Table II and IV, points towards the nature of interactions.
Interactions on WhatsApp are immediate, as new messages
constantly replace old ones. Whereas on Twitter old tweets
can be easily brought back into limelight, using retweets,
comments and likes by influential people. Hence the ability
of Twitter to keep conversation, around a tweet, alive for a
long time could be the reason for the overall life of COVID
tweets (in days) compared to WhatsApp (in hours).

A. Methodology
Twitter was chosen as most of Twitter data is public,
and it serves as one of the major information conduits. We
obtained more than 0.8 million unique tweets starting from
January 10 to April 9 using an exhaustive list of hashtags
related to COVID-19 in Pakistan. It must be noted, that both
Twitter and WhatsApp datasets only represent a subset of
the actual activity and in no way can be thought to represent
the full networks’ behaviour. In order to understand the flow
of information, images and text present within WhatsApp,
from 16 March to 9 April 2020, were compared with tweets
in the same time range. To find similar content across Twitter
and WhatsApp, PDQ hashing was used for images and fuzzy
string matching was used for text messages.

Table IV: Characteristics of images mapped between Twitter
and WhatsApp.

B. Cross Platform Image Spread
To understand how images were propagated across networks, we isolate the tweets containing image content from
the Twitter dataset. This covers a total of 67,119 images. We
then generate PDQ hashes for both WhatsApp and Twitter
images, and matching two images if their hashes have a
Hamming distance of 40 (default value suggested by PDQ).
Around 1,500 similar images were found common to both
WhatsApp and Twitter, within the date range of interest (16
March and 9 April). Out of these 1,500 images, 541 were
COVID-19 related.
Table IV breaks down the images into the categories previously described, alongside the average number of retweets,
replies and the lifetime of the image (difference between
first and last appearance of an image on Twitter). Firstly,
we observe that the largest category of images shared across
both Twitter and WhatsApp is that of misinformation (29%).
We can also see that misinformation tweets have a high
average number of retweets, potentially reaching tens of
thousands of users. This is signal in Twitter (or other social

A schematic diagram of the temporal flow of images
across WhatsApp and Twitter is shown in Figure 9. The
Figure also provides three example case studies of images
which originated on WhatsApp and went on to become
widely retweeted on Twitter. From our analysis of the
timelines of images observed on both platforms, we can
conclude that most of the images are seen originating from
WhatsApp and then appearing on Twitter (in our dataset).
On average an image appears on WhatsApp 4 days earlier as
compared to Twitter. As a result in light of the data analyzed,
it can be concluded that WhatsApp plays a critical role
in COVID related content dissemination to other networks
7

in Pakistan. This is especially important in the context
of results from Table IV with a majority (29%) of the
content that is common between the two platforms being
misinformation, compared to only 12% being information.

VIII. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have provided the first detailed analysis
of Pakistani WhatsApp public groups, focusing on the
COVID-19 discourse. We have analyzed WhatsApp text
and image messages collected for more than 6 weeks from
227 public WhatsApp groups to shed light on the salient
misinformation dissemination trends and to share insights
on how Pakistani social media users are experiencing and
responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work is unique
as this is the first work to not only study misinformation trends on WhatsApp but also find a relation between
WhatsApp and Twitter. Our analyses showed that while
it is true that the majority of shared information is not
misinformation, misinformation seems to have a longer
lifespan on WhatsApp compared to other types of COVID
messages (the lifetime of misinformation is roughly 4 times
that of correct information). On Twitter the inverse was
seen, as COVID misinformation tended to disappear from
Twitter 3 times faster than information. This can potentially
be attributed to the open nature of Twitter, and how a vast
number of users can publicly negate such tweets. While
observing user behavior, we found 8 images that could be
attributed to organized disinformation, other than that, we
did not find any evidence of disinformation within images.
Whereas more work is required in detecting disinformation
via text messages. We conclude by saying that our dataset
has only scratched the surface of how user interactions
happen on WhatsApp. More work needs to be performed to
understand user behavior, and new ways need to be proposed
to detect misinformation in such closed networks.
