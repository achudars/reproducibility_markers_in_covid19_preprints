Abstract—Real-world growth processes, such as epidemic
growth, are inherently noisy, uncertain and often involve multiple
growth phases. The logistic-sigmoid function has been suggested
and applied in the domain of modelling such growth processes.
However, existing definitions are limiting, as they do not consider
growth as restricted in two-dimension. Additionally, as the
number of growth phases increase, the modelling and estimation
of logistic parameters becomes more cumbersome, requiring
more complex tools and analysis. To remedy this, we introduce
the nlogistic-sigmoid function as a compact, unified modern
definition of logistic growth for modelling such real-world growth
phenomena. Also, we introduce two characteristic metrics of the
logistic-sigmoid curve that can give more robust projections on
the state of the growth process in each dimension. Specifically,
we apply this function to modelling the daily World Health
Organization published COVID-19 time-series data of infection
and death cases of the world and countries of the world to
date. Our results demonstrate statistically significant goodness
of fit greater than or equal to 99% for affected countries of the
world exhibiting patterns of either single or multiple stages of the
ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, such as the USA. Consequently, this
modern logistic definition and its metrics, as a machine learning
tool, can help to provide clearer and more robust monitoring and
quantification of the ongoing pandemic growth process.

I. I NTRODUCTION
We introduce a modern approach to modelling real-world
growth (or decay) processes by extending the classic logisticsigmoid function definition – the nlogistic-sigmoid function
(NLSIG). Motivated by observing the multiple sigmoidal paths
of ants, and that the growth (or motion) of a phenomenon
with respect to its input (such as time) is always finite in both
input–output dimensions, we propose the NLSIG, a compact
and unified logistic-sigmoid function (LSIG) definition for
sigmoidal curvatures with multiple peak inflection points.
Such a function in the general multiple-input multiple-output
sense, can be viewed as equivalent to a feed-forward neural
network, and has the notable advantage of improving the
modelling power of the logistic-sigmoid function. In addition,
we introduce two characteristic metrics of the NLSIG curve
that can give more robust real-time projective measures on the

geometric (exponential) state of a growth process. We demonstrate how the basic NLSIG neural pipeline can be applied
to modelling and monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic, which
is a current real-world (natural) growth phenomena. COVID19 data-sets (infections and death cases) obtained from the
World Health Organization were used. The NLSIG model
demonstrated up-to 99% statistical significant goodness-offit in our experiments. The NLSIG code for this paper is
available at the repository [1]. Consequently, as the logisticsigmoid definition is unified through the NLSIG with enhanced
modelling power, we anticipate that it will find immense
benefit in the many scientific areas were predictive growthmodelling and regression analysis of real-world phenomena
(single or multiple outcomes) are of interest.
A. Background
Classic Logistic-Sigmoid. As opposed to an infinite (or
unrestricted) exponential (or logarithmic) growth function, the
logistic growth function is a finite (or restricted) logarithmic
growth function, hence the name ‘logistic’ [2], [3]. There are
many descriptions that can be given to the logistic-sigmoid
function. One is that: it is a step-function that features a
convex-concave (S) or concave-convex (mirrored S) shape
with a derivative function having a bell (or normal)-like distribution [4]. Such a bell-shape becomes triangular when data is
coarse. Classically, it is defined or modelled as having a output
domain of finite minimum and maximum bounds [ymin , ymax ]
on an input co-domain (support) of infinite bounds [−∞, ∞]
respectively [5], [6].

Logistic-sigmoids have found numerous useful scientific and
engineering applications to real-world data. This is evident in
probability-theory and statistics such as, for example as activation functions in artificial neural networks, logistic regression
models, resource allocation models, maximum utility models,
population-growth models, plant-growth models, autocatalysis
reaction models, signal-processing models, power-transistor
models, fermi-dirac distribution models, tumour and infection
growth models, in fields such as: engineering and computer
science, economics, bioinformatics, population biology, cropscience, chemistry, semi-conductor physics, epidemiology, and
many others for modelling certain real-world growth processes
[4], [6]–[15]. Notably, the logistic-sigmoid function is characterized by a point of maximum growth rate (peak inflectionpoint). Mathematically, this is described as the point where the

2

second-derivative or acceleration changes sign, that is a value
of zero. Therefore a necessary condition that a point xt on the
support (dependent variable) interval is an inflection-point is
that σ 00 (xt+1 ) and σ 00 (xt−1 ) have opposite signs.

Interestingly, the logistic-sigmoid function (1) has been
modified and referred to by different names such as the
generalised logistic model (2) or the generalised richard’s
model [16]. However, we note that this definition is overparametrized by the presence of three parameters ς, γ and β,
which violate the location integrity of δ as the peak inflectionpoint and hence the maximum logistic growth fails to occur
at the point x = δ, except when ς = γ = β = 1.
Primarily, the notion of the logistic-sigmoid being symmetric
around δ, as highlighted in [14], [17], led to the richard’s
model to deal with both symmetric and asymmetric growth.
Also, similar symmetry arguments are given in [18], where
the authors propose hyperbolastic functions for generalizing
sigmoidal growth. The authors fail to note that just like the
gompertz function, error functions, trigonometric functions
like the hyperbolic tangent, and so on lead to sigmoidal
curvatures, they are all just over-complicated means in the
‘mathematical sense’ of describing the standard logistic growth
phenomenon.
Contrarily to these authors, we note that such notions
on symmetry around the peak inflection-point becomes unfounded when the input co-domain bounds to the logisticsigmoid function are enforced. That is, when the realistic assumption that growth is always restricted, not only in the space
dimension (y) of the phenomena but also in the time dimension (x). Therefore, retaining its mathematical simplicity, the
logistic-sigmoid function without the extra parametrizations of
the richard’s model or hyperbolastic models becomes by itself
powerful enough to describe a wide range of natural growthprocesses whether symmetric or not.
Growth Processes. The growth (flow or trend) dynamics in any direction (positive or negative) for many natural
phenomena such as epidemic spreads, population growths,
adoption of new ideas can be and have been approximately
modelled by the logistic-sigmoid curve [19]. The prevalence
of the LSIG is such that the cumulative and incident growth
or flow distribution of many natural phenomena in the world
follows a saturated non-linear growth well approximated by
the sigmoidal and bell curve respectively [14]. The scientific
basis for this prevalence is, the constructal law origin of the
LSIG , given in [20]. Many of such growth-processes can be
viewed as complex input–output systems that involve multiple
peak inflection phases with respect to time. Such dynamic
systems can be modelled using a sum or superposition of
logistic-sigmoids, an idea that can be traced back in the
crudest sense to [21]. This idea is also seen, for instance, in
the universal-approximation theorems perspective of artificial
neural networks that state that: in principle, any continuous
function can be approximated arbitrarily well, to any desired
accuracy, by single-hidden layer networks formed by a suitably
large finite additive combination of logistic-sigmoid functions

between the input-output layer for pattern classification and
non-linear time-series prediction tasks [4], [5], [22]. Similarly,
multistage logistic models have been discussed in [6], [8],
[23]–[25] in application to modelling multiple waves of epidemics. In particular, the LSIG with time-varying parameters
is the core trend model in Facebook’s Prophet model for timeseries growth-forecasting at scale [19] on big data.
However, two recurring limitations of the logistic definitions
in these works exist, a trend that has continued since the first
logistic-sigmoid function introduction.
First is that, the support interval (co-domain) of logisticsigmoids is assumed to be infinite, this as we will discuss
in the next section, violates the critical natural principle
of finite growth. Second, estimation of the different hyperparameters for the logistic-sigmoids that make the multiple
logistic-sigmoid sum is done separately, instead of as a whole,
single function. The effect of this, is that, as the number of
logistic-sigmoids considered in the sum increases, regression
analysis becomes more cumbersome and complicated as can
be observed in these works [15], [16], [19], [23]–[25].
These limitations are efficiently overcome by the proposed
NLSIG function for the logistic-sigmoid curve with n ≥ 1 multiple peak inflections on a compactly bounded support interval
with simplified computations of its derivatives and partialderivatives at each layer, which make the NLSIG compatible
with gradient-descent optimization algorithms [22], [26].
Admittedly, epidemiological models such as the SEIRD
variants [15], [27] are just another form of representing sigmoidal growth [12]. It has been noted in [28] that the SEIRDvariant models yield largely exaggerated forecasts on the final
cumulative growth number. This can also be said of the results
of various application of logistic modelling as regards the
current state of the COVID-19 pandemic which have largely
resulted in erroneous identification of the epidemic’s progress
and its future projection [16], [23], [29], hence leading policymakers astray. Compared to the basic-reproduction number
metric that has been used in such epidemiological models
[12] and engaging in false prophecy or predictions of an
ongoing growth phenomena, whose source is both uncertain
and complex to be encoded in current mathematical models,
on the contrary, for the NLSIG curve we introduce two reliable
metrics for robust projective measurements of the modelled
time-evolution of a growth-process in an area or locale of
interest. Also, as opposed to most of the works, we use, as
noted in [9] the cumulative growth data, instead of the daily
growth-rate data.
II. T HE NLOGISTIC - SIGMOID
Exponential growth at its core implies an output function
y → ∞ as the input x → ∞. Interestingly, many real-world
situations do not have infinite bounds or intervals, there is
always a limit (or restriction) to everything. Approximation
of this reality, led to the LSIG growth model, in that, every
phenomena is finite, even when it seems infinite. There is
always a clear beginning and end, even if unknown. However,
as can be observed in physical systems, the concept of x,
which we can call the time or input co-domain interval of a

3

growth phenomenon, being finite is one that has been largely
overlooked in the definitions of the LSIG in the literature.
More generally, in this paper, we describe the LSIG distribution as a map with: a single peak inflection-point which
makes its derivative a bell-shape distribution; and two valley
inflection-points which defines the minimum and maximum locations of its co-domain. The valley inflection-points indicate
that the phenomena being modelled intrinsically has imposed
limits on its growth in a two-dimensional (2D) direction,
which we can call output–input or space–time. Extending this
description to n peak inflection-points gives a unified modern
definition of the LSIG, which we term the nlogistic-sigmoid
(NLSIG) function.
The logistic growth is, therefore, essentially a story of
inflection-points on the x support interval. This implies that
there are two possible ways to model such curves. One
is by assuming that generally growth occurs on arbitrarily
partitioned interval/sub-intervals or automating by assuming
that growth occurs on an equally partitioned interval/subintervals. Since for real-world growth processes, events do not
necessarily happen at equal intervals, the general definition, as
will be presented, is a more powerful tool.
Specifically, using this notion of partitioning both the output
and input intervals of the LSIG, that is, its domain and codomain, we realize the NLSIG. This is a more powerful
function definition or model of n peak inflection points and
2n valley inflection-points, where, for a partition defined by
a single peak inflection-point, there are p hyper-parameters to
realize almost any kind of smooth growth shape.
Notably, an important characteristic of the LSIG when n = 1
is that at the peak inflection-point, the y is at half of its
max-min interval difference on the y-dimension. It should
be strongly noted that this does not in any way imply a
symmetric growth pattern, except in some cases, when the
max-min interval of x is equally partitioned.
Consequently, we provide formal, compact and unifying
definition of the NLSIG pipeline for any arbitrary finite interval
in single-output and multiple-output forms in Sections III
to IV respectively. The core pipeline, the single-input singleoutput or multiple-input single-output (SISO/MISO) form is
illustrated in Figure 1. The general multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) network is illustrated in Figure 2. We also
provide definitions for the derivatives, jacobian and hessian of
the function for use with gradient-based optimization methods.
Also, the logistic metrics are introduced in Section V.
III. SISO/MISO P IPELINE
In contrast to the classic logistic definition, a repeating sigmoid behaviour found in the motion-profile of ant-swarms can
be emulated within any finite input-output universe specified
by [xmin , xmax ] and [ymin , ymax ]. The specified finite input
and output universe (space) when partitioned into n equal
sub-spaces with n inflection points at x = δi leads to υi
sub-sigmoids, where i = 1, ..., n. This transforms the classic
logistic-sigmoid function to a sum of n shifted sigmoids each
with a bounded and continuous gradient map over the surface
of the input-output universe on an exponential base bi , where

Remark 1. The single-output NLSIG model can be used for
binary logistic regression, where the ymaxn = 1 and yminn =
0. The weighted sum of inputs is x and called the logit or
quantile. The inputs can be single, that is, univariate (single
explanatory input-variables) or multiple, that is: multivariate (multiple explanatory input-variables). Regression, loosely
speaking is ‘data fitting’. It involves the use of a set of
independent or explanatory xl variables to predict a set of
dependent variables or outcomes yj through some optimization
(learning) method like the non-linear least-squares.

Modelling COVID-19 data from official sources, assuming
it is reliable, is a way to truly monitor the scale and impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic phenomena. In this context, we
apply the NLSIG to model the COVID-19 pandemic. Further,
to estimate the uncertainty of our model estimates, we use a
parametric bootstrap approach to estimate the 95% confidence
intervals on the uncertainty in the best-fit parametric solution
of the NLSIG model for data-sets obtained from the World
Health Organization up to the 6th of December 2020.
Therefore, given such real-world growth-process described
by its noisy data-sets, we developed a problem-based optimization workflow in MATLAB 2019b, as follows, for fitting
the COVID-19 datasets to the NLSIG function.:
1) find the possible locations of the inflection-points in the
data, noting that the logistic-sigmoid curve at its core is
characterized by three phases: pre-peak, peak and postpeak phases.
2) use the detected 3n inflection-points to find n and use
as initial guess to a suitable optimization solver to find
an estimated solution to the inflection points and other
three hyper-parameters.
3) applying the bootstrap method, find the 95% confidence intervals on the best-fit solution of the p hyperparameters for each i-partitions of the logistic layer,
obtained as a whole, by the solver.
We illustrate our results with the projected logistic-metrics on
the growth-evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic for the world
as a whole, and then selected countries in four continental
locations of the world. For Europe, the locales are: UK,
Italy, France, Sweden, Turkey, Russia. For Asia, the locales
are: China, Japan, South-Korea, India, Israel, Iran, UAE.
For America and Australia, the locales are: USA, Canada,

Remark 2. Because of the n in its name, the NLSIG is
essentially itself a neural function. The basic SISO/MISO
pipeline has 1 hidden unweighted logistic parameter layer. For
the SIMO/MIMO pipeline, that becomes m hidden unweighted
logistic parameter layers. When explanatory inputs are used,
there is an added 1 hidden weight layer for the SISO/MISO
case, and, m hidden weight layers for the SIMO/MIMO case.
Therefore the NLSIG is a 2m hidden layer neural function.
where m = 1 by default. At the most basic level, for the SISO
case, we can assume the weight layer is fixed to unity and the
bias weight ω0 is 0. such that x = x1 . For the remainder of this
paper, we shall apply this SISO case to model the COVID-19
growth-process in the world.

the metrics of the NLSIG model solution to the COVID-19
data-sets are significant.
Further from Figures 3 to 13, it is evident that in the
selected countries, known to be affected with the COVID19 epidemic, China has effectively restricted its COVID-19
epidemic growth, compared to most other countries of the
world, especially the USA. It is also inferable that the lockdowns and social-distancing mechanisms, imposed by the
various governments in these countries, has turned out not
to be effective or worth the economic pain, since to date, the
COVID-19 growth curve has not saturated (flattened), so as to
allow full re-opening of the economy. For instance, as at this
time, some countries have entered recession such as Nigeria,
South-Korea, the UK and many others. It will be interesting
to observe, in the coming months, whether with the advent of
vaccines, the world may finally have some respite.
Below we provide textual interpretation for the bootstrapped
95% confidence intervals logistic-metrics, illustrated in Tables I to V for the COVID-19 pandemic as at 6th December,
2020. It should be noted that these estimations are based on
the optimization solution at the current time, and may change
as more data is received. Also the metrics can have a wide
array of intersecting meanings when the confidence intervals

fall in a different range. Notably, these metrics do not indicate
by what amount the growth is increasing or decreasing, or
whether an end has occurred.
World: For infections: the YIR indicates that the numbers
are peaking and may start to decrease soon; the XIR indicates
that this time is most likely a peak period. For deaths: the YIR
indicates that the numbers are still increasing but may likely
peak soon; the XIR indicates that this time may most likely
be a peak period but could also be a pre-peak period.
United Kingdom and Italy: For both infections and deaths:
the YIR indicates that the numbers are now decreasing; the
XIR indicates that this time is clearly a post-peak period.
Nigeria: For infections: the YIR indicates that the numbers
are decreasing compared to the past but may most likely also
be increasing; the XIR indicates that at this time, the growth is
in a post-peak period but could again most likely be a pre-peak
period. For the deaths: the YIR indicates that the numbers are
most likely decreasing compared to the past but could possibly
have started increasing; the XIR indicates that the growth at
this time is clearly in a post-peak period.
South-Africa: For infections: the YIR indicates that the
numbers are still increasing; the XIR indicates that this time
is a pre-peak period. For the deaths: the YIR indicates that the

models, which engage in the risky and costly acts of prophecy,
we propose these metrics as a safer projection, which publicpolicy makers and other professionals can apply in monitoring
the COVID-19 pandemic growth phenomenon (infections or
deaths) and the effectiveness of containment and vaccination
strategies, till the growth flattens out completely in a particular
locale or in the world. Such modelling setup as proposed in
this paper is available at the repository [1].
The only currently noted limitation of the logistic-growth
metrics lies with the NLSIG model solution found by the
optimization algorithm or method.

numbers are increasing or may have reached a peak; the XIR
indicates that this time is a pre-peak period close to a peak
period. For the deaths: the YIR indicates that the numbers
are decreasing; the XIR indicates that this time is a post-peak
period.
Generally, it can be observed that the logistic metrics
when combined from both perspectives give a more robust
interpretation of the growth. Therefore, compared to many

We have presented a modern definition for the classic
logistic function, called the nlogistic-sigmoid function that
can be used to model the uncertain, noisy, multiple growth
behaviour of real-world processes, such as the COVID-19
pandemic, with a high degree of accuracy. This logistic
function definition, itself, was shown to be a neural network.
Two logistic metrics, the YIR and XIR, were newly introduced
for robust monitoring of growth from its two-dimensional
perspective. Our modelling results and the estimated logistic
metrics indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic growth follows,
essentially, the principle of logistic growth. In all applications,
the model solutions provided statistically significant goodness
of fit, often as high as 99%, to the dataset describing the
COVID-19 epidemic spread in the world and each of the
selected locales. We strongly believe that the NLSIG can
again increase the value of the logistic-sigmoid as a powerful
machine learning tool, for modelling and regression, in many
areas such as biomedical and epidemiological research and
other scientific and engineering disciplines.
