Abstract: This study analyzed the morbidity and mortality rates of the coronavirus disease (COVID19) pandemic in different prefectures of Japan. Under the constraint that daily maximum confirmed
deaths and daily maximum cases should exceed 4 and 10, respectively, 14 prefectures were
included, and cofactors affecting the morbidity and mortality rates were evaluated. In particular,
the number of confirmed deaths was assessed, excluding cases of nosocomial infections and nursing
home patients. The correlations between the morbidity and mortality rates and population density
were statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). In addition, the percentage of elderly population was
also found to be non-negligible. Among weather parameters, the maximum temperature and
absolute humidity averaged over the duration were found to be in modest correlation with the
morbidity and mortality rates. Lower morbidity and mortality rates were observed for higher
temperature and absolute humidity. Multivariate linear regression considering these factors
showed that the adjusted determination coefficient for the confirmed cases was 0.693 in terms of
population density, elderly percentage, and maximum absolute humidity (p-value <0.01). These
findings could be useful for intervention planning during future pandemics, including a potential
second COVID-19 outbreak.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported in China in 2019 [1,2] and spread worldwide in early
2020. Japan declared a state of emergency in seven (of 47) prefectures on 7 April 2020 and extended
it to all prefectures on 13 April 2020. The state of emergency was withdrawn on 25 May 2020. During
this state of emergency, unlike many other countries where city lockdowns were enforced, in Japan,
citizens self-isolated. The mortality rate (per population) in Japan is relatively low compared to the
global rate; the total number of confirmed deaths in Japan is 846 (25 May 2020), corresponding to 6.72
per million people [3]. Although a straightforward comparison is infeasible, this number is smaller
than that of many other countries with the same order of magnitude of population: 541, 504, 435, and
295 in Italy, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, respectively, but larger than 5.18 and
4.0 in Indonesia and Australia, respectively (25 July 2020).
An additional difficulty in understanding the morbidity rate is the unreliability of the diagnosis
of COVID-19. The number of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, a simple and cost-effective

method, is limited in Japan, partly because of its reliability. Therefore, chest CT is used for a fasttrack, highly accurate diagnosis [4]. Some patients do not exhibit any common pandemic symptoms
[5], thereby complicating morbidity rate assessment in different areas (e.g., population composition).
Morbidity and mortality statistics have been updated every day in each prefecture in Japan,
which provides a good opportunity for local studies. A notable feature of Japan is that no medical
collapse has been reported. In addition, due to the health insurance system, free medical care for
COVID-19 has been offered. Thus, the reliability of the mortality rate is more accurate than that of
the morbidity rate, because patients with weak or mild symptoms may not be tested. However, to
avoid nosocomial infections and medical resource shortages, it was suggested that people with
specific symptoms (e.g., fever with temperature >37.5 °C for no more than four consecutive days) stay
home and avoid seeking medical attention, unless they had been in close contact with an infected
person(s) or had recently visited foreign countries. Such a policy may result in longer latency in the
reported cases.
In general, coronaviruses are considered to spread mainly by respiratory droplets and contact
via droplets [6]. Droplets tend to fall to the ground close to the infected host. Droplet transmission is
typically limited to short distances, generally less than 2 m. There exist some hypotheses about
transmission due to airborne transmission that remain in flight for one hour or longer [7]. For both
mechanisms, the ambient condition potentially influences the duration of droplet and airborne
spread. Several co-factors potentially influence COVID-19 morbidity/mortality rates [8–14]); among
them, ambient conditions have been considered here.
The effect of ambient temperature on the mortality was discussed in Wuhan [8]. Positive and
negative associations were found between daily COVID-19 death counts and daily temperature
difference and absolute humidity, respectively. The effect of high temperature and humidity on the
transmission of COVID-19 was discussed using relative humidity as a measure [9]. Their finding
suggested that high temperature and humidity may suppress COVID transmission. Furthermore, the
effect of weather on COVID-19 cases employing a case in Jakarta was presented in [10]. They reported
that only average temperature is correlated with the pandemic spread. The effect of ambient
temperature on the confirmed cases was discussed in more than 100 Chinese cities, and it was
concluded that there is no evidence supporting that COVID-19 case counts would decline when the
weather becomes warmer [12]. The effect of ambient temperature and absolute humidity on the
confirmed cases was investigated in cities in China, and the researchers commented that the epidemic
might gradually ease partially due to rising temperatures [13]. Instead, no correlation with UV and
temperature on the transmission of COVID-19 was reported in [15].
Following Chinese studies, case studies in different countries have been reported. Briz-Redón
and Serrano-Aroca [16] evaluated the spatiotemporal analysis of temperature in the cases of early
COVID-19 evolution in Spain. Pirouz et al. [17] discussed the correlation between daily confirmed
cases and temperature, humidity, and velocity with multivariate analysis in Italy. Application of
neural networks for its estimation is also discussed in [18]. A similar attempt has been made in Oslo,
Norway [19]. Recent studies have confirmed the effect of temperature and relative humidity on
morbidity rates in Brazil [20,21]. From these studies, it is difficult to derive a consistent conclusion on
the effect of the weather on the spread of COVID-19. Studies of influenza suggested the importance
of ambient conditions for its spread: lower spread for higher humidity (e.g., [22,23]).
Studies with wider scopes included global data analysis, discussing how temperature and
humidity are correlated with the infection and fatality rates of the COVID-19 pandemic [24,25]. The
region of interest is wide (country level) in these studies, and thus it is not directly applicable to the
ruling or regulation. In addition, some modeling studies have been proposed. However, parameter
setting is not easy for this type of novel virus spread [14,26]; in most modeling studies, the parameters
relating to the weather or population cannot be given explicitly. Instead, the effect of population
density on the spreading effect of the epidemic has been discussed under some assumptions [27].
Nevertheless, none of the aforementioned research and modeling studies simultaneously
considered the impact of population density and ambient conditions. A question that arises here is
To what extent do ambient conditions and population density influence morbidity and mortality

rates in different cities? Unlike the aforementioned studies, a major feature of Japan is the relative
homogeneity of the health insurance and care system without medical collapse during this pandemic.
In addition, the difference in household wealth is relatively small in Japan [28]. The average annual
salary per population is USD 34,400 to 39,900 (USD 1 = JPY 107). The standard deviation of household
consumption in each prefecture is 10% or less [28]. With all these demographic factors, the data
sample discussed here provides a convenient case study with less bias. In a recent study [29], we
examined the time course of the morbidity rate of different prefectures in Japan and found that the
durations of the spread and decay stages can be characterized by population density, temperature,
and absolute humidity. An additional factor would be the ratio of the elderly to the entire population;
in Japan, this ratio reached 28.4% [30], which is ranked the highest globally.
This novel study aimed to evaluate the effect of ambient temperature and humidity on mortality
and morbidity rates in different prefectures in Japan. Additionally, it considered the influence of
population density and composition. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to
highlight the environmental factors’ effect during COVID-19 in Japan. The model of Japan provides
an interesting case study for different factors, as the medical service and social reaction is almost
uniform nationwide and high-quality data were recorded properly. If the correlation of the pandemic
with population density and ambient conditions is significant, the findings will be useful to set the
level and duration for a strict lockdown period for each city considering the environmental factors
and in planning future pandemic measures.
The organization of this study is as follows. In Section 2, the data sources of COVID-19 in Japan
and weather data are mentioned. Then, the statistical method for data processing is explained briefly.
In Section 3, effect of population density, elderly population, and ambient conditions on the
morbidity/mortality rates are evaluated statistically. Based on the evaluation, multivariate linear
regression has been conducted to estimate the morbidity/mortality rate from these parameters. In
Section 4, provides discussion of the results including the limitation. The conclusion is given in
Section 5.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Data Source
In this study, we used three datasets. The first involved the confirmed daily positive cases and
deaths in each prefecture [31]. This dataset is based on the report by the Ministry of Health Labor and
Welfare [32]. We used time-integrated data until 25 May 2020—when the emergency state was
terminated. According to the dataset, 16 prefectures had confirmed total deaths and daily positive
counts higher than 4 and 10, respectively. These prefectures were defined as infected. The remaining
prefectures were excluded due to a lower number of infected cases, which is simply because of the
self-isolation, including the discouragement from moving to other prefectures after the declaration.
In Japan, to avoid nosocomial infections and medical resource shortages, it was suggested that people
with symptoms (e.g., fever >37.5 °C for no more than four consecutive days) stay home and not seek
immediate medical attention unless they had been in close contact with infected people or had
recently visited a foreign country. Some patients have been reported to be asymptomatic [5], making
the statistical study of COVID-19 more complex. Then, the positive rate of the test varied from 2.2%
to 34.8% for different prefectures. Unlike other diseases, the number of confirmed cases/deaths are
counted even when patients are found to be infected after their death. For this data collection, we use
the mortality rate in this study as a metric rather than the case fatality rate.
For comparison, two sets of data were prepared: (1) the number of confirmed deaths excluding
and including nosocomial/nursing facility infection, and (2) the total confirmed positive cases. This
is to avoid the data of cluster infection for high-risk groups, resulting in a higher possibility of death.
Note that among some of the 16 selected prefectures, as shown in Figure 1, the number of victims
due to nosocomial/nursing facility infection was not always reported. Thus, such prefectures were
excluded from the comparisons. Among others, the area of Hokkaido is one to two magnitudes larger
than the other prefectures. Thus, several peaks in the number of cases are observed in different cities

with larger distances between them than those in other adjacent prefectures. In the Gunma prefecture,
three confirmed deaths occurred, except for in Isezaki City, where substantial nosocomial infections
were reported (15 victims). Thus, we used data from the Gunma prefecture, excluding Isezaki City,
for accurate comparison of mortality rates. In addition, Saitama was also excluded since it did not
report humidity data (see below for the third dataset). Two prefectures with unclear
nosocomial/nursing facility infections were also excluded.
The second dataset comprises the population and the area of the prefectures. Based on the
evidence that more than 90% of the victims are older than 60 years and because the retirement age in
Japan is 65, which may potentially influence morbidity rates, we set the threshold as 65. For a total of
14 prefectures and one city, the first and second datasets are listed in Table 1. Note that the rationale
for choosing 25 May as a reference date is the end of state of emergency, and then, the daily confirmed
death over Japan was 20 (128 million population); the daily confirmed death was smaller than 100 for
one month after that.
The third dataset comprises weather data for each prefecture. They are extracted from the
weather reports generated by the Japan Meteorological Agency [33]. In our previous study, we had
studied the correlation between environmental conditions and the duration of the pandemic from its
spread to decay periods [29]. We extended this investigation to the prefectures defined in Table 1. We
then estimated the start and end dates of the spread and decay stages, as defined in Table 2. To
validate the effect of ambient factors in different phases of the pandemic, we computed ambient
features for three time frames: during the spreading stage DS (from TSS to TSE), during the decaying
stage DD (from TDS to TDE), and during both stages (from TSS to TDE).
To consider the mortality rate, which is affected by many factors, it should be noted that the
metrics are averaged over the duration of the spread stage, decay stage, and the entire period. The
duration-averaged values of temperature, absolute humidity, wind velocity, and daylight hours were
calculated from the data available from the internet site mentioned above, as listed in Table 3. The
latitude of Japan considered here is N 33°36′ (Fukuoka) to N 36°35′ (Ishikawa), except for Okinawa of
N 26°12′), and thus, total solar radiation may be marginally influenced with this measure.

2.2. Statistical Analysis
A statistical study was conducted to analyze the correlation of different factors on both mortality
and morbidity rates. The software JMP (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used in this study. In
order to specify dominant factors influencing the rates, p-value was used. We determined the
pairwise correlations by calculating the Spearman’s rank correlation between the number of
confirmed positive cases, confirmed death cases, and different environmental and demographic
parameters. Correlation matrix with partial correlation probability and CI of correlation were
calculated. After that, with the same software, multivariate analysis [34] was conducted in terms of
the factors. We considered linear regression for data least-squares fitting after considering
multicollinearity. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. Effect of Population Density and Elderly Population
Figure 2 shows the relationship between confirmed positive cases and confirmed deaths,
including and excluding nosocomial infections and nursing home patients. A modest correlation was
observed between positive cases per million and population density (R2 = 0.394), whereas a slight and
mild correlation was observed for confirmed deaths (R2 = 0.097) and excluding nosocomial infection
(R2 = 0.259). This result suggests that population density should be considered as a factor that
implicitly represents social distancing, as is similar to our previous study that discussed the
pandemic’s duration [29].
When the cases and deaths for the elderly population were considered, the same tendency was
observed; R2 = 0.363 for cases, and R2 = 0.078 and R2 = 0.210 for deaths with and without nosocomial
infections (not shown to avoid repetition), respectively. Instead, as shown in Figure 3, the morbidity
and mortality rates normalized by population density are modestly correlated with the percentage
of the elderly, especially for confirmed deaths excluding nosocomial infections (R2 = 0.482). This factor
is thus considered in the multivariate analysis study presented later.

3.2. Effect of Ambient Conditions
Several ambient factors potentially influence morbidity and mortality rates. Our study
considered temperature and absolute humidity. Most previous studies reported the maximum,
average, or difference (diurnal variation range) of ambient temperature (e.g., see [8] and [35]). Our
study also considered the minimum temperature. Recent reports on influenza suggest the importance
of absolute humidity rather than its relative value [22,23]; however, we considered the maximum,
average, minimum, and difference values of absolute humidity as parameters. The daily average
wind velocity and daylight hours were also considered. Regression analysis was conducted for all
metrics averaged over the duration of the spread and decay stages and the total duration.

Table 4 lists the coefficients of determination for different metrics. For most parameters, the
averaged values over the total stage provided the highest correlation rather than those over the other
two durations. As an example, Figure 4 shows the correlation between the number of confirmed
positive cases and fatality normalized by the population density and the daily maximum temperature
and diurnal absolute humidity. A moderate correlation was observed among the daily maximum
temperature, diurnal absolute humidity, and cases per population density. Table 5 lists the
Spearman’s rank correlation for different parameters. The ambient factor was normalized by
population density as aforementioned. A moderate correlation was also observed with the daily
maximum temperature, daily maximum, and diurnal absolute humidity and percentage of elderly
population. Correlation was weak with wind velocity and daylight hours.

3.3. Multivariate Linear Regression
In this subsection, the morbidity/mortality rates are estimated in terms of different factors. In
Section 3.1, population density and percentage of the elderly were found to be modest, at least nonnegligible factors for multivariate analysis [34]. In Section 3.2, maximum temperature and absolute
humidity difference were found to be relatively important. No consistency was observed between
mortality and morbidity rates. The data in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures were considered as
outliers from hierarchical clustering (see also [29]).
The difference in absolute humidity is derived from the maximum and minimum absolute
humidity; at least two parameters are needed. In addition, the maximum temperature is also related
to the maximum absolute humidity. In terms of variance inflation factors (VIFs), the multicollinearity
was evaluated. The threshold value to differentiate small from large is generally taken as 10 [36].
From this analysis, a set of population density, elderly percentage, and absolute humidity provided
estimation without multicollinearity: VIF < 3.78 for spread duration, VIF < 3.23 for decay duration,
and VIF < 3.68 for total duration. Note that the maximum ambient temperature was excluded due to
strong correlation with absolute humidity.
Figure 5 shows the multivariate linear regression of cases and deaths per million. Table 6 shows
the determination coefficients for the three durations. As shown in Figure 5, the predicted and actual
data are of good correlation with the averaged value over three stages. The highest contribution rates
were the population density in the multivariate analysis (74.4%, 80.0%, and 84.5% in the cases per
million, deaths per million including, and excluding nosocomial infection, respectively).

4. Discussion
In this study, we analyzed the morbidity and mortality rates in different prefectures in Japan,
where the number of confirmed deaths and daily confirmed positive counts were higher than 4 and
10, respectively. A major feature of Japan was the relative homogeneity of the health insurance and
care system without medical collapse during this pandemic, in addition to household wealth. The
Japanese strategy included identifying infection clusters at an early stage, to the best possible extent.
However, the criteria for conducting tests (diagnosis) on potential patients may not be uniform in
different prefectures; some patients may exhibit weak symptoms. Thus, after retracting the state of
emergency on 25 May 2020, we processed the data for morbidity and mortality rates in 14 prefectures.
The morbidity/mortality rates were then shown to be proportional to the population density. In
previous studies, this factor was not considered [12] nor was correlation between different cities
considered [17]. After excluding the number of confirmed deaths in cluster infections related to
hospital and care services, we observed modest correlation among different cities in terms of
population density. It is worth noting that no strict closure was applied in Japan. Next, we found a
good correlation between population density and the spread of COVID-19. This finding implicitly
represents social distancing. In Tokyo and Osaka, which are considered among cities with the highest
population densities worldwide, infection is potentially more likely to occur compared to other less
dense regions. However, this may not be the case reported in other countries where strict lockdown
was implemented. In Wuhan (China), the duration of the decaying stage was only 10 days, with
almost no contact during the period. However, such strict lockdown may not be allowed in most
countries to avoid severe social and economic damage. Therefore, this study demonstrates that
population density should be considered for avoiding potential spread in future pandemics.
Moreover, this finding may be useful to improve the simulation model of epidemic transmission
[37,38]. The maximum temperature and absolute humidity differences were the dominant ambient
factors characterizing morbidity and mortality rates. As shown in Figure 4, cases and deaths in
Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures have a different tendency than that in other prefectures—as
COVID-19 occurred in a very limited area in these prefectures. In general, for higher temperature and
absolute humidity, the morbidity and mortality rates were decreased. For example, the population
density of Hyogo (650.4 capita/km2) is nearly equal to that of Okinawa (637.5 capita/km2). However,
the total cases in Hyogo were 8.6 times that of Okinawa. The daily maximum temperature in Hyogo
was 7 °C lower than in Okinawa. This relationship can be observed in other prefectures but not all
due to mild correlation with weather condition. The reason for higher correlation with absolute
humidity difference is unclear. However, one potential reason would be the relatively small variation
in a limited period (from mid-March to mid-May). Further study of key factors would be needed.
The ambient conditions in Okinawa prefecture differ the most from those of other prefectures in
Japan. If the data of Okinawa are excluded, the correlation of confirmed cases and deaths improved.
In particular, the total cases and deaths normalized by population have a mild correlation with the
maximum temperature and absolute humidity averaged over spread duration (from 0.13 < R2 < 0.18
to 0.37 < R2 < 0.55).
The effect of ambient conditions on the morbidity and mortality rates was shown to be modest
over multiple prefecture studies. As mentioned in the introduction, this was a controversial COVID19 issue. Our study hypothesized that this may be caused by population density, which was not
considered in previous studies, as well as the uniformity of the policy, health insurance system,
household wealth, etc.

The morbidity and mortality rates were roughly derived via multivariate analysis. Note that the
ambient parameters are cross-correlated with each other, and thus further research and investigation
are needed. Their adjusted-R2 was almost the same; 0.69 (p < 0.01) for positive cases, and those for
confirmed deaths including and excluding nosocomial infection were 0.53 (p < 0.05) and 0.15 (p =
0.25), respectively. This statistical finding may be improved for modeling studies. The correlation
with the mortality rate excluding nosocomial infection was relatively low, suggesting that
nosocomial infection would be a part of COVID-19 transmission at least in Japan.
Unlike previous studies that discussed the correlation with ambient condition in each city (e.g.,
[17]), our study explores common factors over 14 prefectures, resulting in lower p-value as compared
to such studies. In such cases, the uncertainty of measured ambient condition would also be another
factor to influence the correlation. For example, no correlation with ambient condition was observed
in the analysis of 122 cities in China [12].
Note that according to the record of the Ministry of Health in Japan, no pandemic has been
reported in the last 50 years [39]. Thus, a comparison with other epidemics is infeasible. Common
influenza has been recorded, but only at fixed points (hospitals), making proper comparison difficult
[39]. However, the finding of this study that presents the effect of population density and ambient
conditions may be useful when considering measures for potential future pandemics.
5. Conclusions
A mild correlation was found of mortality and morbidity rates with the population density and
the percentage of the elderly population, in addition to maximum absolute humidity averaged over
the spread stage under Japanese policy. The multivariate linear regression provided adjusted
coefficients of determination, which were 0.69 and 0.53 (p < 0.05) for positive cases and confirmed
deaths, respectively. Our results suggested that with population and weather data, we can estimate
the number of cases and deaths, at least in Japanese cities. Although the date and duration of the
pandemic were different even in Japan, our estimation presented mild correlation, providing useful
information for the planning of policy and medical resources. With our findings, more customized
guidelines can be developed, specific to where and when different measures can be applied to restrict
the adverse effects caused by a potential pandemic in the future, including a second wave of COVID19. The limitation of this study is that the weather data in different prefectures are similar to each
other due to the limited period (March to May 2020), and thus further data are needed for a general
conclusion. The controversy in previous studies may be potentially caused by the population density
and elderly population percentage, as those were not considered in most studies. Thus, these factors
should be included for proper comparisons with the tendencies of international cities.
