Abstract
We have applied a computational strategy, based on the synergy of virtual screening, docking and molecular dynamics techniques, aimed at identifying possible lead
compounds for the non-covalent inhibition of the main protease 3CLpro of the SARSCov2 Coronavirus. Based on the recently resolved 6LU7 PDB structure, ligands were
generated using a multimodal structure-based design and then optimally docked to the
6LU7 monomer. Docking calculations show that ligand-binding is strikingly similar
in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 main proteases, irrespectively of the protonation state
of the catalytic CYS-HIS dyad. The most potent docked ligands are found to share
a common binding pattern with aromatic moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a
pseudo-linear arrangement. Molecular dynamics calculations fully confirm the stability
in the 3CLpro binding pocket of the most potent binder identified by docking, namely
a chlorophenyl-pyridyl-carboxamide derivative.

At the beginning of this year, the world was dismayed by the outbreak of a new severe viral
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), currently known as COVID-19, that rapidly spreads
1

from its origin in the Hubei Chinese district to virtually whole China and, as of today, to
more than thirty nations in five continents. 1 The new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV2 and
believed to have a zoonotic origin, has infected thus far about 80000 people worldwide with
nearly 10000 in critical conditions, causing the death of more than 3000 people. The SARSCoV2’s genome 2,3 has a large identity 4 with that of the SARS-CoV whose epidemic started
in early in 2003 and ended in the summer of the same year.
Most of the Coronaviridae genome encodes two large polyproteins, pp1a and, through
ribosomal frameshifting during translation, 5 pp1ab. These polyproteins are cleaved and
transformed in mature non-structural proteins (NSPs) by the two proteases 3CLpro (3Clike protease) and PLpro (Papain Like Protease) encoded by the open reading frame 1. 6
NSPs, in turn, play a fundamental role in the transcription/replication during the infection. 5
Targeting these proteases may hence constitute a valid approach for antiviral drug design.
The catalytically active 3CLpro is a dimer. Cleavage by 3CLpro occurs at the glutamine
residue in the P1 position of the substrate via the protease CYS-HIS dyad in which the
cysteine thiol functions as the nucleophile in the proteolytic process. 7 While dimerization
is believed to provide a substrate-binding cleft between the two monomers, 8 in the dimer
the solvent-exposed CYS-HYS dyads are symmetrically located at the opposite edges the
cleft, probably acting independently. 9 As no host-cell proteases are currently known with
this specificity, early drug discovery was directed towards the so-called covalent Michael
inhibitors, 10 via electrophilic attack to the cysteinate of the 3CLpro dyad. On the other
hand, the consensus in drug discovery leads to excluding electrophiles from drug candidates
for reasons primarily relating to safety and adverse effects such as allergies, tissue destruction,
or carcinogenesis. 11
In spite of the initial effort in developing small-molecule compounds (SMC) with anticoronavirus activity immediately after the SARS outbreak, 12 no anti-viral drug was ever
approved or even reached the clinical stage due to a sharp decline in funding of coronavirus
research after 2005-2006, based on the erroneous conviction by policy-makers and scientists
2

that chance of a repetition of a new zoonotic transmission was extremely unlikely. The most
potent non-covalent inhibitor for 3CLpro , ML188, was reported nearly ten years ago 13 with
moderate activity in the low micromolar range. 14
According to the latest report of the structure of 3CLpro from SARS-CoV2 15 (PDB code
6LU7) and the available structure of 3CLpro from SARS-CoV, 12 (PDB code 1UK4), the two
main proteases differ by only 12 amino acids, with α carbon atoms all lying at least 1 nm
away from the 3CLpro active site (see Figure 1a). The substrate-binding pockets of two

main proteases. Violet spheres corresponds to the alpha carbons of the 12 differing residues
in the two structures. Grey spheres indicate the CYS-HIS dyad b): view of the binding
pocket with the main residues in bond representation (green and red for SARS-CoV2 and
SARS-CoV, respectively). The shaded region mark the binding site for the substrate
coronavirus main proteases are compared in Figure 1b, exhibiting a strikingly high level of
alignment of the key residues involved in substrate binding, including the CYS145· · · HIS41
dyad, and HIS163/HIS172/GLU166. The latter residues are believed to provide the opening
gate for the substrate in the active state of the protomer. 12
Figure 1(a,b) strongly suggest that effective non-covalent inhibitors for SARS-CoV and
3

SARS-CoV2 main proteases should share the same structural and chemical features. In order
to investigate this matter, we have performed a molecular modeling study on both the 6LU7
and 1UK4 PDB structures. 6LU7 is the monomer of the main protease in the active state
with the N3 peptidomimetic inhibitor 15 while 1UK4 is the dimer with the protomer chain
A in the active state. 12 The main protease monomer contains three domains. Domains I
and II (residues 8-101 and residues 102-184) are made of antiparallel β-barrel structures in
a chymotrypsin-like fold responsible for catalysis. 16
The 6LU7 structure was first fed to the PlayMolecule web application 17 using a novel
virtual screening technique for the multimodal structure-based ligand design, 18 called Ligand
Generative Adversarial Network (LIGANN). Ligands in LIGANN are generated so as to
match the shape and chemical attributes of the binding pocket and decoded into a sequence
of SMILES enabling directly the structure-based de novo drug design. SMILES codes for
ligands were obtained using the default LIGANN values for shapes and channels with the
cubic box center set at the midpoint vector connecting the SH and NE atoms of the CYSHIS dyad in the 6LU7 PDB structure. The PlayMolecule interface delivered 93 optimally
fit non-congeneric compounds, spanning a significant portion of the chemical space, whose
SMILES and structures are reported in the Supporting Information (SI). Each of these
compounds was docked to the 6LU7 and to the 1UK4 structures, using Autodock4 19 with
full ligand flexibility. For both structures, the docking was repeated by setting the dyad with
the residue in their neutral (CYS-HIS) and charged state (CYS− /HIS+ ). Further details on
Docking parameters are given in the SI.
Results for the binding free energies of the 93 LIGGAN-determined 3CLpro ligands are
reported in Figure 2. Binding free energies are comprised in the range 4-9 kcal/mol and
are found to be strongly correlated for the two protonation states of the CYS-HIS dyad.
Correlation is still high when ligand binding free energies for the main proteases are compared, confirming that good binders for SARS-CoV are, in general, also good binders for
SARS-CoV2 3CLpro .

Supporting Information. The common color-coded z-scale on the right corresponds to the
2D probability.
For each of these compounds, using the knowledge-based XLOGP3 methodology, 20 we
computed the octanol/water partition coefficient (LogP) to assess the distribution in hydrophobic and cytosolic environments. LogP values range from -0.5 to a maximum of 5 with
a number of rotatable bonds from 2 to a maximum of 12. Most of the LIGGAN compounds
bear from 2 to 5 H-bond acceptor or donors (see Table 1 of the SI). In Figure 3 we show
the 2D probability distributions for ∆G correlated in turn to the LogP, number of H-bond
donor/acceptors and number of rotatable bonds. We note, on the left and central panel,
sharp maxima for LogP = 3 : 4, ∆G = −7 : −8 and for H-acc/don = 3, ∆G = −6 : −7,
respectively, suggestive of a ligand-protein association driven mostly by hydrophobic interactions. We must stress here that the computed ∆G pertains to the associations of the ligand
with one protein whatever the state of association of the protein. At free ligand concentration
equal to Kd ≡ e−∆G/RT , i.e. when half of the protein molecules are inhibited, the probability
to have both monomers inhibited is equal to 1/4, whatever the dissociation constant of the
dimer, 21 hence the need for identifying nanomolar or subnanomolar inhibitors of 3CLpro .
Figure 4 shows the chemical structures of the five compounds exhibiting the highest
6

binding affinity to the 6LU7 main protease of SARS-CoV2 when the CYS-HIS dyad is in
the neutral state. None of these compounds is commercially available, although some of
them (27, 31, 40) show a high degree of similarity with known structures according to the
Tanimoto metrics. 22 The LIGGAN-determined structures of Figure 4, as well as many of
those reported in Figures 1-5 of the SI, seem to share a common pattern with aromatic
moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a pseudo-linear arrangement. In Table 1, the
binding free energy data of these five best ligands are shown for both CoV proteases and both
protonation states of the catalytic dyad. Inspection of Table 1 confirms that SARS-CoV2

Figure 4: fig:Best binders for SARS-CoV2 main protease
best binders 27, 29, 39, 77, 19 are also good binders for SARS-CoV 3CLpro . Remarkably,
compound 27 is consistently the most potent ligand for the two proteases, irrespective of
the dyad protonation state. In the Table 1 we also report the Autodock4-computed binding
free energy for ML188. The Autodock4-predicted binding free energy for the association of
ML188-SARS-Cov protease is -6.2 and -6.5 kcal/mol for the H-HIS and H-CYS tautomers,
not too distant from the experimentally determined value of -8 kcal/mol, hence lending
support for the LIGGAN-Autodock4 protocol used in identifying the lead compounds of
Table 1.

Experimental value for ML188 is ∆G = −7.98 kcal/mol.
In order to assess the stability of the 3CLpro -27 association, we have performed extensive
molecular dynamics simulations 2,3 of the bound state with explicit solvent. The overall structural information was obtained by combining data from three independent simulations (for a
total of about 120 ns), all started from the best docking pose of 27 on the 6LU7 monomeric
structure. Further methodological aspects 25 are provided in the Supporting Information. In

Figure 5: a) Probability distribution of the distance between the centers of mass of compound
27 and domain I+II of 3CLPRO as obtained from triplicates MD simulations (120 ns in total)
(in the inset the corresponding PMF is shown). b) Binding pocket of 6LU7 with ligand 27.
The time record of the minimal distances between ligand and the depicted nearby residues
are reported in Figures 6, 7 of the Supporting Information.
Figure 5, we show the probability distribution, P (R), of the distance R between the center
8

of mass (CoM) of the ligand and that of the domains I+II. The distribution has nearly a
Gaussian shape with a half-width of about 1 Å, exhibiting only a minor positive skewness
and defining a tight binding site volume Vsite of few Å3 at most. 26 The MD-determined P (R)
shows that the ligand never leaves the binding pocket at any stage during the whole simulation. In the inset of Figure 5a, we show the potential of mean force (PMF) along the
ligand-protein CoM distance R, computed as v(R) = −RT log(P (R)/ max[P (r)]). As 1/Kd
R
= Vsite e−βv(R) dR,, 27 the steepness of the curve is suggestive of a profound minimum and
hence of a large association constant, confirming the indication obtained from the Docking calculations. Figure 5b shows polar and hydrophobic residues found in at least 90%
of the simulation time within 4.5 and 5.5 Å distance, respectively, from any atom of the
ligand 27. All essential residues for binding are included, with the important addition of
Met165, Phe140 and Leu141 hydrophobic residues that consistently linger near the pyrazolic
or the chlorinated phenyl rings of 27, in agreement with the hydrophobic character of the
interaction.
Figures 3 and 5 shows possible avenues for improvement. For example, forcing the Lshaped binding structure (see Figure 5b) in bulk also, possibly by redesigning the rotatable
connectors in the ligand, may reduce the penalty due conformational entropy loss upon
binding, 26 hence boosting the ligand affinity for 3CLpro . Building upon this knowledge, we
hence plan to optimize the lead using MD simulations coupled to efficient relative binding free
energy calculation via free energy perturbation on congeneric variants, 28 eventually providing
in silico determined anti-viral compounds to be synthesized an experimentally tested in vitro
and in vivo.
While the infection rate for COVID 19 in China is currently declining for days, new
shocking outbreaks are developing in the South Corea, the Middle East and Europe, with
high risk for a pandemic. The scientific community is hence called to an extraordinary and
collaborative effort for a rapid delivering of an effective anti-COVID 19 drug, hoping that
our contribution can be of help in such a worldwide endeavor.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions, whose side-length was chosen so that the minimum distance between protein
atoms belonging to neighboring replicas was larger than 14 Å in any direction. The system
(protein+compound) was explicitly solvated with the SPC/E 1 water model at the standard
density. The starting configuration was generated using GROMACS 2,3 and PrimadORAC. 4
The system was initially minimized at 0 K with a steepest descent procedure and subsequently heated to 298.15 K in an NPT ensemble (P=1 atm) using Berendsen barostat 5 and
velocity rescaling algorithm 6 with an integration time step of 0.1 fs and a coupling constant
of 0.1 ps for 250 ps.
Production run in the NPT ensemble were carried out starting three independent simulations with different initial velocities randomization. Each MD run has been performed
for 40 ns (for a total of 120 ns) imposing rigid constraints only on the X-H bonds (with X
being any heavy atom) by means of the LINCS algorithm (δt=2.0 fs). 7 Electrostatic interactions were treated by using particle-mesh Ewald (PME) 8 method with a grid spacing of
1.2 Å and a spline interpolation of order 4. The cross interactions for Lennard-Jones terms
were calculated using the Lorentz-Berthelot 9,10 mixing rules and we excluded intramolecular
non-bonded interactions between atom pairs separated up to two bonds. The non-bonded
interactions between 1-4 atoms involved in a proper torsion were scaled by the standard
AMBER fudge factors (0.8333 and 0.5 for the Coulomb and Lennard-Jones, respectively).
The simulations and the trajectories analysis were carried out using the GROMACS
2018.3 program. 2,3
