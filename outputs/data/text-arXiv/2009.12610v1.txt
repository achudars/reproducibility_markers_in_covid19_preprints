Abstract
Purpose. Imaging plays an important role in assessing severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. However,
semantic interpretation of chest radiography (CXR) findings does not include quantitative description
of radiographic opacities. Most current AI-assisted CXR image analysis framework do not quantify
for regional variations of disease. To address these, we proposed a four-region lung segmentation
method to assist accurate quantification of COVID-19 pneumonia.
Methods. A segmentation model to separate left and right lung is firstly applied, and then a carina and
left hilum detection network is used, which are the clinical landmarks to separate the upper and lower
lungs. To improve the segmentation performance of COVID-19 images, ensemble strategy
incorporating five models is exploited. Using each region, we evaluated the clinical relevance of the
proposed method with the Radiographic Assessment of the Quality of Lung Edema (RALE).
Results. The proposed ensemble strategy showed dice score of 0.900, which is significantly higher
than conventional methods (0.854-0.889). Mean intensities of segmented four regions indicate
positive correlation to the extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities under the RALE
framework.
Conclusion. A deep learning-based model in CXR can accurately segment and quantify regional
distribution of pulmonary opacities in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Introduction
The COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1, 2].
Starting in December 2019 from the province of Hubei, China, COVID-19 became a pandemic that
has claimed over 800,000 lives, infected over 24 million people worldwide, and wrecked economic
and social hardships in all six inhabited continents [3]. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the preferred test for confirming COVID-19 infection. Despite its
limitations and limited availability in several parts of both developed and developing world, most
international and national organizations recommend RT-PCR assays for screening and initial
diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.
Use of imaging, computed tomography (CT) and chest radiography (CXR), for initial
diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia is extremely common in sites with high prevalence and/or limited
availability of RT-PCR assays. However, there is consensus that imaging should be used judiciously,
and most often, in patients with moderate to severe disease and those with complications and
comorbidities. Both CT and CXR are used for establishing disease extent or severity of pulmonary
opacities. Compared to CT, CXRs are more accessible, mobile, cheaper, lower dose, efficient, as well
as easier to sanitize and use in intensive care settings. Prior studies have reported on role of these
imaging modalities for initial diagnosis and qualitative severity of COVID-19 pneumonia [2, 4, 5].
For automated classification and detection of COVID-19 cases, deep learning-based methods
with both CT and CXRs have been proposed [6-9]. To assess disease severity from quantitative extent
of pneumonia, an automatic method for prediction of severity score have been introduced with a deep
learning-based method [10], which showed high correlation score at R2 0.865 and 0.746 with
radiological extent and opacity. Some clinical studies using the CXR have tried to segment the whole
lung into subsets for predicting the severity of the diseases [11]. With importance of early diagnose in
CXRs, lung segmentation methods have been used to reduce non-specific signals such as tube or lines
efficiently [12, 13].
4

CXR findings in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia range from normal lungs and subtle
haziness in mild or early to more extensive diffuse opacities consistent with diffuse pnueumonia and
adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe and advanced disease. Radiographic assessment
of lung edema (RALE) is a score indicating the severity of ARDS and COVID-19 pneumonia on
CXRs [14]. For RALE score, each lung is divided into two regions, upper and lower based on a
horizontal line through the level of origin of the left upper lobar bronchus from the left mainstem
bronchus. Then, density and extent of pulmonary opacities is subjectively graded by radiologists in
each of the four regions to determine the regional and total scores of pulmonary opacities. The RALE
score has been validated as a good predictor for ARDS [11]. However, the method is prone to interand intra-observer variations, challenging in settings of low lung volume, and too tedious and
inefficient for incorporation into interpretation routine. Other studies have proposed six-region
division of lungs [15, 16].
In this study, we propose a deep learning-based model to segment four regions of lung in
CXRs of COVID-19 patients. To achieve a robust four-region lung segmentation, two deep learningbased segmentation and detection models are proposed as shown in Fig. 1. For the four-region lung
mask, left and right regions are firstly segmented, where a majority voting ensemble method is used
from five deep learning-based segmentation models. Then, the upper and lower sub regions are
divided by the positions of carina and hilum predicted by a deep learning-based detection model. For
validation of the segmented regions, each mean intensity calculated by normalized pixels for each
region is used to validate correlation with extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities.

Materials and methods
Data Description
1) Segmentation. Since anatomic segmentation of lungs is independent of radiographic
abnormalities, for training segmentation models, two public datasets; RSNA pneumonia detection
challenge dataset [17] and JSRT dataset [18], were used. RSNA pneumonia detection challenge
dataset consists of 568 CXRs from tuberculosis chest dataset in department of health and human
services (HHS) of Montgomery county and JSRT dataset consists of 257 CXRs from JSRT dataset in
Japanese society of radiological technology (JSRT) in cooperation with the Japanese Radiological
Society, were used to train segmentation models.
For evaluation of the segmentation model performance, 200 CXRs of 51 patients with
COVID-19 pneumonia were obtained from three hospitals in South Korea including Kyungpook
National University Hospital, Daegu Catholic University Hospital, and Yeungnam University Hospital.
2) Detection. The carina and left hilum detection algorithms were trained on another 704
CXRs from 166 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia between February-May 2020, at the
same hospitals in South Korea, including Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu Catholic
University Hospital, and Yeungnam University Hospital (Table I). The positions of carina and left
hilum were annotated under the supervision of a subspecialty chest radiologist with 13 years of
clinical experience in thoracic imaging. For each CXR, a bounding box was placed around the left
hilum. The inferior margin of carina was also annotated with a point marker. A bounding box of 100
pixels centered at the carina point was used for the training of carina detection algorithm.
3) Correlation. To further validate the proposed 4-region segmentation algorithm, each CXR
was evaluated for its RALE score. The RALE score was evaluated by giving extent (0-4) and density
(0-3) scores of pulmonary opacities in each region of the lung [11]. For each region, the correlation
between its mean intensity and the corresponding extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities
were analyzed.

Segmentation model
U-net architecture [19] using skip connection was selected to train the segmentation models,
which is the most widely used network structure for segmentation in the field of medical imaging. We
trained five segmentation models with different conditions including backbones, pre-processing, and
augmentation properties as shown in Table 1. EfficientNet v0 and v7 architecture [20] were used as
the backbone network in the U-net to train the first to third segmentation models and the fourth and
fifth segmentation models, respectively. Gaussian noise and gamma correction were adjusted to
improve the robustness of the models to pixel noises from the portable devices. To train segmentation
models robust to Anterior-Posterior (AP) CXRs that is not included in the public datasets,
morphological transformation methods such as grid distortion, affine transform, and elastic
transformation with different parameters were used as augmentation methods [21]. Five binary masks
were used to generate an ensemble mask based on the majority voting method. Technically, if a half of
masks were predicted as a lung for a pixel, the pixel is labeled as a lung region.
In addition, post-processing steps were taken to refine the ensemble mask. All the holes were
filled with the dilation operation and the isolated regions were eliminated.
The augmentation methods with different parameters were adjusted during training [5] in the
five models. All models were trained with same hyper-parameters, such as Adam optimizer (learning
rate: 0.0001), epochs (200), batch size (8) and same input size at 256×256. Best models were selected
at the lowest loss on the validation dataset.

Detection model
We propose a novel and robust method to find a central point for segmentation of the whole
region into four-regions such as right upper region (RUR), right lower region (RLR), low upper
region (LUR), and left lower region (LLR). Although conventional RALE score described a
horizontal line through the origin of the left upper lobe bronchus for 4-segment classification of lungs,
it is difficult to see this point in most patients with COVID-19 with portable CXRs. As a surrogate,
7

the left hilum is the closest landmark for dividing upper and lower regions. However, the left hilum is
sometimes difficult to be detected in those patients with advanced disease or patient rotation. On the
other hand, carina is clear under most circumstances, and its relative position to the left hilum is stable
at approximately 2cm [22] above the left hilum vertically. Therefore, we also used carina to identify
the central point for horizontal lung segmentation into upper and lower regions.
RetinaNet [23] was used to train the detection model for the carina and the left hilum. The
central point of prediction box is used as a reference horizontal level that divide the upper and lower
lungs. Most of the time, we select the prediction box for the left hilum for dividing the lung into upper
and lower regions. However, if the model confidence of the left hilum detection is lower or equal to
0.9, the prediction box for the carina would be used.
To train a robust detection model, augmentation methods [21] such as rotation, translation,
shearing, scaling, pixel noise, different range of contrast, brightness, hue, and saturation were used.
The best model was selected as the lowest total loss in the validation set.

Normalization
Intensity normalization is normally used as a pre-processing to reduce statistical distribution
of the intensity among input CXRs. Different devices or setting parameters cause CXRs showing
brightness differences as shown in Fig. 2. Density scores of Fig. 2(a)-(d) were confirmed at 0 while
each showed quite different mean intensities of the lung at 39.8, 34.4, 16.6, and 13.2, respectively. To
reduce this variation, intensity normalization was conducted. Pixels inside of the lung were
normalized by subtracting their values with the mean intensities outside of the lung regions. The
normalized pixels were averaged to obtain each representative value for each region to evaluate its
correlation with extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities.

Correlation with RALE score
Extent (0-4) and density (0-3) scores of pulmonary opacities were manually assigned by an
8

experienced radiologist for each region of the lung according to the guideline [11].
The extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities were correlated with the mean intensity
corresponding to the same location divided by the proposed algorithm. To evaluate if there is a linear
relationship between regional mean intensity and the RALE score, we used the subset of COVID-19
patients with a RALE score larger than 0. Pearson correlation [24] was used to test the relationship.

Statistical Evaluation
Model performance comparisons for segmentation were conducted with anonymized dataset
(three hospitals in South Korea) in terms of Dice score to select the best segmentation model. Then,
we conducted pair-wise comparisons of Dice scores between the ensemble model and others to show
significant difference (p < 0.05).

Experimental Environment
Experimental environments were on Ubuntu 16.04 with a Tesla V-100 GPU, CUDA
9.0/cuDNN 7.0 (NVidia Corporation), and Keras 2.0 deep learning platform.

Results
Model performance for segmentation are listed in Table 3. The first to the fifth segmentation
models were merged to the ensemble model. Model performance of the ensemble model including all
models had the highest dice coefficient (0.908 ± 0.057) with significant statistical differences from
Model 1 to 5 (All p<0.05).
Fig. 3 shows an example of advantages of the ensemble method for different quality of
CXRs. The first to the last row in each column shows an input CXR, the ground truth mask, the
ensemble result, and the five results predicted by the individual segmentation models. Fig. 3(a-1)
shows a high quality CXR without medical device, substantial patient rotation, and over- or underradiographic exposure. The five individual models gave consistent segmentations shown in Fig. 3(a4)-(a-8).
The CXR in Fig. 3(b-1) was challenging due to consolidation and/or atelectasis in the left
lower lobe which obscures delineation of left lung hilum. Left lung hilum can also be obscured by
dense perihilar opacities or marked patient rotation. Compared to the consistent results predicted by
the first to third models as shown in Fig. 3(b-4)-(b-6) (0.929, 0.943, 0.934), the masks resulting from
model 4 and 5 under-estimated the area of right lung (0.817, 0.831). The ensemble could still reach a
robust mask (0.933) as shown in Fig. 3(b-3).
Fig. 3(c-1) shows a left chest tube traveling up to and obscuring visualization and detection
of left hilum. Compared to the consistent results predicted by the third to fifth models as shown in Fig.
3(c-6)-(c-8) (0.883, 0.879, 0.903), the first and second models labeled areas outside of lung regions
as shown in Fig. 3(c-4) and Fig. 3(c-5) (0.783, 0.885) due to extending into the right chest wall
subcutaneous emphysema which has intensity similar to the right lung. The ensemble results gave a
relative robust mask (0.899) as shown in Fig. 3(c-3).
Model performance for detection of left hilum and carina in terms of mean of average
precision (mAP [37]) was observed at 0.694. Fig. 4 shows different examples for selection of a
reference point to divide upper and lower lungs. Fig. 4(a) shows an example with high confidence in
10

detection result (left hilum: 0.94), where the center of the left hilum bound box is directly used as the
reference horizontal level for the upper and lower lung region separation as shown in Fig. 4(b). In Fig.
4(c), the confidence of the detection result was low (left hilum: 0.56), and then the vertically 2cm
lower position of the carina bound box was used for the upper and lower region separation as shown
in Fig. 4(d).
After normalization, the mean intensity of each region was correlated with the corresponding
extent (0-4) and opacity (0-3) scores. Fig. 5(a)-(d) shows the correlation of the extent score with mean
intensities for each region, i.e., RUR, LUR, RLR, and LLR. For each region, the mean intensity
increased as the extent scores increased. The correlation with the extent score for the LUR showed a
strong positive linear relationship at 0.716 (<0.001) as shown in Fig. 5(c), and correlation values with
the extent score for LUR, RUR, and RLR showed moderate positive linear relationship at 0.625
(<0.001), 0.454 (<0.001), and 0.457 (<0.001), respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(a), (b), and (d).
In case of density scores, the tendency that each mean intensity increased as the density
scores increased was observed as shown in Fig. 5(e)-(h). The correlation with the density scores for
RUR, LUR, RLR, and LLR showed moderate positive linear relationship at 0.553 (<0.001), 0.469
(<0.001), 0.506 (<0.001), and 0.465 (<0.001), respectively.
Distribution of mean intensity for each region is shown in Fig. 6. Sum of left lung region is
higher than that of right lung region. The mean intensity of LLR where heart is not segmented in the
segmentation algorithm is lower than that of other regions.

11

Discussion
In this work, we proposed a four-lung region auto-segmentation algorithm and validated the
algorithm with correlation of the mean intensities for each region segmented by the algorithm with
extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities from the radiologist.
In the detection model for the carina and left hilum, the mAP for the carina was higher at
0.743 than that for the left hilum at 0.467 since the quality of labeling the left hilum was inferior to
that of the carina. It is because labeling the exact locations of the left hilum is harder due to wider
longitudinal extent, overlap from cardiomediastinal structures, obscuration from adjacent pulmonary
opacities, or overlapping lines and tubes, while labeling the location of the carina is easier due to less
noise. It showed that the model performance highly depends on the quality of labeling data though
same number of training set with labeling data were used.
In validation of the segmentation models, two different public datasets (RSNA pneumonia
detection challenge and JSRT datasets) and the anonymized dataset were used. On the public datasets,
the five individual models showed comparable dice coefficients at around 0.958-0.967 due to high
radiographic quality of the posterior-anterior (PA) projection public datasets with low disease burden;
both factors make it easier for each model to segment lung regions. However, in the testing dataset
most CXRs for COVID-19 patients were captured with AP CXR instead of the PA CXRs in the
training dataset. The AP CXRs were limited due to lower radiographic quality, lower lung volumes,
patient rotation, and a larger number of chest tubes, lines, and devices. To overcome these issues, the
ensemble method was selected with segmentation models trained with different conditions. In training
segmentation model, different augmentation properties and backbone networks with ensemble lead to
robust lung mask in different situation such as position, image quality, intubated patients, etc. To train
the segmentation model robust to noise from portable device and posture that never been seen when
training, Gaussian noise and distortion transform augmentations were used. Different backbone
networks were adjusted due to train models robust to intubated patients and low contrast CXRs, which
predicted robust lung masks.
12

Correlation of the extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities with the mean intensities
for each lung region showed at least moderate positive linear relationship as shown in Fig. 3. For RLR,
the correlation of extent score with a mean intensity showed a strong positive relationship at Pearson
correlation 0.716 (p<0.005). Apart from the inherent limitations of portable AP projection CXRs, the
less than substantial correlation between the model and the subjective scores can also be related to
type of pulmonary opacities. Dense basilar opacities in COVID-19 pneumonia, likely related to severe
airspace opacification (or consolidation on CT images), obscure the lung margins at their interface
with hemidiaphragm and cardiomediastinal structures (note the obscured lower lungs in Fig 4(a)) and
consequent underestimation of lung volume with segmentation as well as evaluation of the extent and
density of pulmonary opacities. Such opacities require dedicated training datasets which were not
available to our model.
Although we showed the Pearson correlation of the segmented regions with extent and
density scores of pulmonary opacities, the proposed method still has a great potential combined with
various clinical applications. For the development of clinical methods, the segmentation model will be
a crucial pre-processing tool for extracting lung regions in CXRs. In the future, combined with the
proposed method as a pre-clinical step, we will develop an automatic prediction method of the RALE
and the severity prediction model for COVID-19 patients.

13

Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed the deep learning-based four-region lung segmentation method in
CXRs for COVID-19 patients, where the detection model to find the center positions of carina and
hilum structures was incorporated to divide upper and lower regions. The proposed ensemble method
based on five segmentation models trained with different augmentations and backbone networks
showed significantly high performance than a single model in terms of dice coefficient. To evaluate
the feasibility of the proposed method, we confirmed the positive correlation between intensities of
segmented regions and extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities. Future work will focus on
automatic prediction of the RALE and clinical evaluations using CXRs from multiple sites and the
severity prediction model for COVID-19 patients.

Fig. 1. A flowchart of the proposed algorithm for segmentation of zones of the lung in CXR of
COVID-19 patient. Right (R) and left (L) lung masks are generated by an ensemble method based on
the majority voting from five lung masks predicted by models trained with different conditions. Then,
left hilum and carina are detected and used to find a central point to split the whole lung into upper
and lower regions. Finally, right upper lung (RUR), right lower lung (RLR), low upper lung (LUR),
and left lower lung (LLR) are obtained.

Fig. 2. Cases with same density scores (0) but with distinct mean intensities on CXR. Mean intensities
of lungs from (a) to (d) are 39.8, 34.4, 16.6, and 13.2, respectively.

Fig. 3. An example of advantages of the ensemble method for different quality of CXRs. The first to
last row in each column shows an input CXR, a ground truth mask, an ensemble result, and five
results predicted by the first to fifth model. (a-1) A clear CXR that shows none of severe noise from a
portable device and obstacles like medical devices, (b) a lung mask of (a-1), (a-3) an ensemble mask
from the first to the fifth masks (a-4)-(a-8). Dice coefficients of (a-3)-(a-8) are 0.955, 0.928, 0912,
0.948, 0.948, and 0.948, respectively. (i) An CXR showing severe blurry within both lung regions due
to lung opacity, (b-2) a lung mask of (b-1), (b-3) an ensemble mask from the first to the fifth masks
(b-4)-(b-8). Dice coefficients of (b-3)-(b-8) are 0.955, 0.928, 0912, 0.948, 0.948, and 0.948,
respectively. (c-1) An CXR showing sever noise generated from a portable device, (c-2) a lung mask
of (c-1), (c-3) an ensemble mask from the first to the fifth masks (c-4)-(c-8). Dice coefficients of (c3)-(c-8) are 0.899, 0.783, 0.885, 0.883, 0.879, and 0.903, respectively.
