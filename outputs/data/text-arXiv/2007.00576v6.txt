Introduction

Practical progress at combating COVID-19 highly
depends on effective search, discovery, assessment
and extension of scientific research results. However, clinicians and scientists are facing two unique
barriers on digesting these research papers.
The first challenge is quantity. Such a bottleneck in knowledge access is exacerbated during a
pandemic when increased investment in relevant
research leads to even faster growth of literature
than usual. For example, as of April 28, 2020, at
PubMed3 there were 19,443 papers related to coronavirus; as of June 13, 2020, there were 140K+
related papers, nearly 2.7K new papers per day
(see Figure 1). The resulting knowledge bottleneck
contributes significant delays in the development

To combat COVID-19, both clinicians and scientists need to digest vast amounts of relevant
biomedical knowledge in scientific literature
to understand the disease mechanism and related biological functions. We have developed
a novel and comprehensive knowledge discovery framework, COVID-KG to extract finegrained multimedia knowledge elements (entities and their visual chemical structures, relations and events) from scientific literature. We
then exploit the constructed multimedia knowledge graphs (KGs) for question answering and
report generation, using drug repurposing as
a case study. Our framework also provides
detailed contextual sentences, subfigures, and
knowledge subgraphs as evidence. All of the
data, KGs, reports1 , resources, and shared services are publicly available2 .

Figure 1: The Growing Number of COVID-19 Papers
at PubMed

of vaccines and drugs for COVID-19. More intelligent knowledge discovery technologies need to
be developed to enable researchers to more quickly
and accurately access and digest relevant knowledge from the literature.
The second challenge is quality. Many research
results about coronavirus from different research
labs and sources are redundant, complementary, or
even conflicting with each other, while some false
information has been promoted in both formal publication venues as well as social media platforms
such as Twitter. As a result, some of public policy responses to the virus, and public perception
of it, have been based on misleading, and at times
erroneous, claims. The relative isolation of these
knowledge resources makes it hard, if not impossible, for researchers to connect the dots that exist in
separate resources to gain new insights.
Let us consider drug repurposing as a case
study.4 Besides the long process of clinical trial and
4
This is a pre-clinical phase of biomedical research to discover new uses of existing, approved drugs that have already
been tested in humans and so detailed information is available
on their pharmacology, formulation and potential toxicity.

Figure 2: COVID-KG Overview: From Data to Semantics to Knowledge

biomedical experiments, another major cause of the
lengthy discovery phase is the complexity of the
problem involved and the difficulty in drug discovery in general. The current clinical trials for drug
repurposing rely mainly on reported symptoms in
considering drugs that can treat diseases with similar symptoms. However, there are too many drug
candidates and too much misinformation published
in multiple sources. The clinicians and scientists
thus urgently need assistance in obtaining a reliable ranked list of drugs with detailed evidence,
and also in gaining new insights into the underlying molecular cellular mechanisms on COVID-19
and the pre-existing conditions that may affect the
mortality and severity of this disease.

To tackle these two challenges we propose a new
framework, COVID-KG, to accelerate scientific
discovery and build a bridge between the research
scientists making use of our framework and clinicians who will ultimately conduct the tests, as
illustrated in Figure 2. COVID-KG starts by reading existing papers to build multimedia knowledge
graphs (KGs), in which nodes are entities/concepts
and edges represent relations and events involving
these entities, as extracted from both text and images. Given the KGs enriched with path ranking
and evidence mining, COVID-KG answers natural
language questions effectively. With drug repurposing as a case study, we focus on 11 typical
questions that human experts pose and integrate
our techniques to generate a comprehensive report
for each candidate drug.

2.1

Coarse-grained Text Knowledge
Extraction

Our coarse-grained Information Extraction (IE)
system consists of three components: (1) coarsegrained entity extraction (Wang et al., 2019a) and
entity linking (Zheng et al., 2015) for four entity types: Gene nodes, Disease nodes, Chemical nodes, and Organism. We follow the entity
ontology defined in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) (Davis et al., 2016), and
obtain a Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Unique

ID for each mention. (2) Based on the MeSH
Unique IDs, we further link all entities to the
CTD and extract 133 subtypes of relations such as
Gene–Chemical–Interaction Relationships, Chemical–Disease Associations, Gene–Disease Associations, Chemical–GO Enrichment Associations and
Chemical–Pathway Enrichment Associations. (3)
Event extraction (Li et al., 2019): we extract 13
Event types and the roles of entities involved in
these events as defined in (Nédellec et al., 2013),
including Gene expression, Transcription, Localization, Protein catabolism, Binding, Protein modification, Phosphorylation, Ubiquitination, Acetylation, Deacetylation, Regulation, Positive regulation,
and Negative regulation. Figure 3 shows an example of the constructed KG from multiple papers.
Experiments on 186 documents with 12,916 sentences manually annotated by domain experts show
that our method achieves 83.6% F-score on node
extraction and 78.1% F-score on link extraction.

SARS-CoV-2 CORONAVIRUS has been sequenced [3]. A phylogenetic EVOLUTION analysis
[3, 4] found a bat WILDLIFE origin for the SARS-CoV-2 CORONAVIRUS. There is a diversity of
possible intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 CORONAVIRUS, including pangolins WILDLIFE,
but not mice EUKARYOTE and rats EUKARYOTE [5]. There are many similarities of SARSCoV-2 CORONAVIRUS with the original SARS-CoV CORONAVIRUS. Using computer
modeling, Xu et al. [6] found that the spike proteins GENE_OR_GENOME of SARS-CoV-2
CORONAVIRUS and SARS-CoV CORONAVIRUS have almost identical 3-D structures in the
receptor binding domain that maintains Van der Waals forces PHYSICAL_SCIENCE. SARSCoV spike proteins GENE_OR_GENOME has a strong binding affinity to human ACE2

[7]. SARS-CoV-2 CORONAVIRUS and SARS-CoV spike proteins GENE_OR_GENOME share
identity in amino acid sequences and ……

Figure 4: Example of Fine-grained Entity Extraction

However, questions from experts often involve
fine-grained knowledge elements, such as “Which
amino acids in glycoprotein are most related to
Glycan (CHEMICAL)?”. To answer these questions, we apply our fine-grained entity extraction
system CORD-NER (Wang et al., 2020c) to extract
75 types of entities to enrich the KG, including
many COVID-19 specific new entity types (e.g.,
coronaviruses, viral proteins, evolution, materials,
substrates and immune responses). CORD-NER
relies on distantly- and weakly-supervised methods
(Wang et al., 2019b; Shang et al., 2018), with no
need for expensive human annotation. Its entity annotation quality surpasses SciSpacy (up to 93.95%
F-score, over 10% higher on the F1 score based
on a sample set of documents), a fully supervised
BioNER tool. See Figure 4 for results on part of a
COVID-19 paper (Zhang et al., 2020).

2.3

Image Processing and Cross-media
Entity Grounding

Figures in biomedical papers may contain different types of visual information, for example, displaying molecular structures, microscopic images,
dosage response curves, relational diagrams, and
other uniquely visual content. We have developed
a visual IE subsystem to extract the visual information from figures to enrich the KG. We start by
designing a pipeline and automatic tools shown
in Figure 5 to extract figures from papers in the
CORD-19 dataset and segment figures into nearly
half a million isolated subfigures. In the end, we
perform cross-modal entity grounding, i.e., associating visual objects identified in these subfigures
with entities mentioned in their captions or referring text. To start, since most figures are embedded
as part of PDF files, we run Deepfigures (Siegel
et al., 2018) to automatically detect and extract figures from each PDF document. Then each figure
is associated with text in its caption or referring
context (main body text referring to the figure). In
this way, a figure can be attached, at a coarse level,
to a KG entity if that entity is mentioned in the
associated text.
To further delineate semantic and visual information contained within each subfigure, we have developed a pipeline to segment individual subfigures
and then align each subfigure with its corresponding subcaption. We run Figure-separator (Tsutsui
and Crandall, 2017) to detect and separate all nonoverlapping image regions. On occasion, subfigures within a figure may also be marked with alphabetical letters (e.g., A, B, C, etc). We use deep neural networks (Zhou et al., 2017) to detect text within
figures and then apply OCR tools (Smith, 2007) to
automatically recognize text content within each
figure. To identify subfigure marker text and text

or heatmap displays.5

Figure 6: Expanding KG through Subfigure Segmentation and Cross-modal Entity Grounding. The figure
image shown here is from (Ekins and Coffee, 2015)

labels for analyzing figure content, we rely on the
distance between text labels and subfigures to locate subfigure text markers. Location information
of such text markers can also be used to merge
multiple image regions into a single subfigure. At
the end, each subfigure is segmented, and associated with its corresponding subcaption and referring context. The segmented subfigures and associated text labels provide rich information that
can expand the KG constructed from text captions.
For example, as shown in Figure 6, we apply a
classifier to detect subfigures containing molecular
structures. Then by linking the specific drug names
extracted from within-figure text to corresponding
drug entities in the coarse KG constructed from
the caption text, an expanded cross-modal KG can
be constructed that then links images with specific
molecular structures to their drug entities in the
KG.
2.4

We first build a data index from the knowledge
elements in the constructed KGs, and then create
a Kibana dashboard6 out of the generated data indices. Each Kibana dashboard has a collection
of visualizations that are designed to interact with
each other. Dashboards are implemented as web applications. The navigation of a dashboard is mainly
through clicking and searching. By clicking the
protein keyword EIF2AK2 in the tag cloud named
“Enzyme proteins participating Modification relations”, a constraint on the type of proteins in modifications is added. Correspondingly, all the other
visualizations will be changed.
One unique feature of the semantic visualization is the creation of dense tag clouds and dense
heatmaps, through a process of parameter reduction over relations, allowing for the visualization of
relation sets as tag clouds and multiple chained relations as heatmaps. Figure 7 illustrates such a dense
heatmap that contains relations between proteins
and implicated diseases (e.g., “those proteins that
are down-regulators of TNF which are implicated
in obesity”), along with their type information7 .

Knowledge Graph Semantic
Visualization

In order to enhance the exploration and discovery
of the information mined from the COVID-19 literature through the algorithms discussed in previous
sections, we create semantic visualizations over
large complex networks of biomedical relations using the techniques proposed by Tu et al. (2020).
Semantic visualization allows for visualization of
user-defined subsets of these relations interactively
through semantically typed tag clouds and heat
maps. This allows researchers to get a global view
of selected relation subtypes drawn from hundreds
or thousands of papers at a single glance. This in
turn allows for the ready identification of novel relations that would typically be missed by directed
keyword searches or simple unigram word cloud

Knowledge-driven Question
Answering

4
4.1

In contrast to most current question-answering
(QA) methods which target single documents, we
have developed a QA component based on a combination of KG matching and distributional semantic
matching across documents. We build KG indexing
and searching functions to facilitate effective and
efficient search when users pose their questions.
We also support extended semantic matching from
the constructed KGs and related texts by accepting
multi-hop queries.
A common category of queries is about the connections between two entities. Given two entities
in a query, we generate a subgraph covering salient
paths between them to show how they are connected through other entities. Figure 3 is an example subgraph summarizing the connections between
Losartan and cathepsin L pseudogene 2. The paths
are generated by traversing the constructed KG,
and are ranked by the number of papers covering
the knowledge elements in each path in the KG.
Each edge is assigned a salience score by aggregating the scores of paths passing through it. In
addition to knowledge elements, we also present related sentences and source information as evidence.
We use BioBert (Lee et al., 2020), a pre-trained
language model to represent each sentence along
with its left and right neighboring sentences as local contexts. Using the same architecture computed
on all respective sentences and the user query, we
aggregate the sequence embedding layer, the last
hidden layer in the BERT architecture with average
pooling (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). We use the
similarity between the embedding representations
of each sentence and each query to identify and
extract the most relevant sentences as evidence.
Another common category of queries includes
entity types, rather than entity instances, and requires extracting evidence sentences based on type
or pattern matching. We have developed E VI DENCE M INER (Wang et al., 2020a,b), a web-based
system that allows for the user’s query as a natural
language statement or an inquiry about a relationship at the meta-symbol level (e.g., CHEMICAL,
PROTEIN) and then automatically retrieves textual
evidence from a background corpora of COVID19.

A case study on Drug Repurposing
Report Generation
Task and Data

A human-written report about drug repurposing
usually answers the following typical questions.
1. Current indication: what is the drug class?
What is it currently approved to treat?
2. Molecular structure (symbols desired, but a
pointer to a reference is also useful)
3. Mechanism of action i.e., inhibits viral entry,
replication, etc. (w/ a pointer to data)
4. Was the drug identified by manual or computation screen?
5. Who is studying the drug? (Source/lab name)
6. In vitro Data available (cell line used, assays
run, viral strain used, cytopathic effects, toxicity, LD50, dosage response curve, etc.)
7. Animal Data Available (what animal model,
LD50, dosage response curve, etc.)
8. Clinical trials on going (what phase, facility,
target population, dosing, intervention etc.)
9. Funding source
10. Has the drug shown evidence of systemic toxicity?
11. List of relevant sources to pull data from.
The answers to questions #5 and #11 are extracted based on the meta-data sections of research papers in scientific literature, including the
author affiliation and acknowledgement sections.
The answers for other questions are all extracted
based on the knowledge graphs constructed and
knowledge-driven question-answering method described above.
As in our case studies, DARPA biologists inquired about three drugs, Benazepril, Losartan, and
Amodiaquine, and their links to COVID-19 related

papers from three Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): NCBI PMC API, NCBI Pubtator API
and CORD-19 archive. We provide incremental
updates including new papers, removed papers and
updated papers, and their metadata information at
our website9 .
4.2

Results

As of June 14, 2020 we collected 140K papers.
We selected 25,534 peer-reviewed papers and constructed the KG that includes 7,230 Diseases,
9,123 Chemicals and 50,864 Genes, with 1,725,518
Chemical-Gene links, 5,556,670 Chemical-Disease
links, and 77,844,574 Gene-Disease links. The KG
has received more than 1,000+ downloads. Our
final generated reports10 are shared publicly. For
each question, our framework provides answers
along with detailed evidence, knowledge subgraphs
and image segmentation and analysis results. Table 1 shows some example answers.
Several clinicians and medical school students
in our team have manually reviewed the drug repurposing reports for three drugs, and also the KGs
connecting 41 drugs and COVID-19 related chemicals/genes. In checking the evidence sentences and
reading the original articles, they reported that most
of our output is informative and valid. For instance,
after the coronavirus enters the cell in the lungs,
it can cause a severe disease called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. This condition causes
the release of inflammatory molecules in the body
named cytokines such as Interleukin-2, Interleukin6, Tumor Necrosis Factor, and Interleukin-10. We
see all of these connections in our results, such as
the examples shown in Figure 3 and Figure 9. With
further checks on these results, the scientists also
indicated that many results were worth further investigation. For example, in Figure 3 we can see
that Lusartan is connected to tumor protein p53
which is related to lung cancer.

image analysis and cross-media knowledge grounding, and KG matching into QA.

Conclusions and Future Work

We have developed a novel framework, COVIDKG, that automatically transforms a massive scientific literature corpus into organized, structured,
and actionable KGs, and uses it to answer questions
in drug repurposing reporting. With COVID-KG,
researchers and clinicians are able to obtain informative answers from scientific literature, and thus
focus on more important hypothesis testing, and prioritize the analysis efforts for candidate exploration
directions. In our ongoing work we have created a
new ontology that includes 77 entity subtypes and
58 event subtypes, and we are building a neural IE
system following this new ontology. In the future
we plan to extend COVID-KG to automate the creation of new hypotheses by predicting new links.
We will also create a multimedia common semantic
space (Li et al., 2020a,b) for literature and apply it
to improve cross-media knowledge grounding and
inference.

Ethical Considerations

to identify candidate drugs, then follow a standard
research methodology to investigate their actual
utility (involving literature reviews, computer simulations of drug mechanisms and effectiveness, invitro studies, cellular in-vivo studies, etc. before
moving to clinical studies.). Our tool COVID-KG
(and all knowledge discovery tools for biomedical
applications) is not meant to be used for direct clinical applications on any human subjects. Rather,
our tool aims to highlight unseen relations and patterns in large amounts of scientific textual data that
would be too time consuming for manual human
effort. Accordingly, the tool would be useful for
stakeholders (e.g., biomedical scientists) to identify specific drug candidates and molecular targets
that are relevant in their biomedical and clinical
research aims. Use of our knowledge discovery
tool allows the researcher to narrow down the set
of candidate drugs to investigate rapidly, but then
proceed with the usual sequence of steps before
kicking off expensive and time-consuming clinical
tests. Failure to follow this sequence of events, and
use of the system without the required human review, could lead to misguided experimental design
wasting time and resources.
Check evidence and source before use our
system results. In addition, our tool provides
source and rich evidence sentences for each node
and link in the KG. To curtail potential harms
caused by extraction errors, users of the knowledge
graphs should double check the source information and verify the accuracy of the discovered leads
before launching expensive experimental studies.
We spell out here the positive values, as well as
the limitations and possible solutions to address
these issues for future improvement. Moreover,
any planned investigations involving human subjects should first be approved by the stakeholder’s
IRB (Institutional Review Board) who will oversee the safety of the proposed studies and the role
of COVID-KG before any experimental studies
are conducted. COVID-KG is a tool to enhance
biomedical and clinical research; it is not a tool for
direct clinical application with human subjects.

Required Workflow for Using Our System
Human review required. Our knowledge discovery tool provides investigative leads for pre-clinical
research, not final results for clinical use. Currently, biomedical researchers scour the literature

Limitations of System Performance and Data
Collection
System errors. Our system can effectively convert
a large amount of scientific papers into knowledge
graphs, and can scale as literature volume increases.
However, none of our extraction components is

perfect, they produce about 6%-22% false alarms
and misses as reported in section 2. But as we
described in the workflow, all of the connections
and answers will be validated by domain experts
by checking their corresponding sources before
they are included in the drug repurposing report.
COVID-KG is developed for pre-clinical research
to target down drugs of interest for biomedical
scientists. Therefore, no human subjects or specific populations are directly subjected to COVIDKG unless approved by the stakeholder’s IRB
who oversees the safety and ethical aspects of the
clinical studies in accordance with the Belmont
report (https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-andpolicy/belmont-report/index.html). Accordingly,
COVID-KG will not impose direct harm to vulnerable human cohorts or populations, unless misused
by the stakeholders without IRB approval. With regards to potential harm in preclinical studies, users
of COVID-KG are advised to verify the accuracy
of the discovered leads in the source information
before conducting expensive experimental studies.
Bias in training data. Proper use of the technology requires that input documents are legally and
ethically obtained. Regulation and standards (e.g.
GDPR13 ) provide a legal framework for ensuring
that such data is properly used and that any individual whose data is used has the right to request its
removal. In the absence of such regulation, society relies on those who apply technology to ensure
that data is used in an ethical way. The input data
to our system is peer-reviewed publicly available
scientific articles. An additional potential harm
could come from the output of the system being
used in ways that magnify the system errors or bias
in its training data. The various components in
our system rely on weak distant supervision based
on large-scale external knowledge bases and ontologies that cover a wide range of topics in the
biomedical domain. Nevertheless, our system output is intended for human interpretation. We do not
endorse incorporating the system’s output into an
automatic decision-making system without human
validation; this fails to meet our recommendations
and could yield harmful results. In the cited technical reports for each component in our framework,
we have reported detailed error rates for each type
of knowledge element from system evaluations and
provide detailed qualitative analysis and explana13

tions.
Bias in development data. We also note that
the performance of our system components as reported is based on the specific benchmark datasets,
which could be affected by such data biases. Thus
questions concerning generalizability and fairness
should be carefully considered. Within the research
community, addressing data bias requires a combination of new data sources, research that mitigates
the impact of bias, and, as done in (Mitchell et al.,
2019), auditing data and models. Sections 2 and ??
cite data sources used for training to support future
auditing. A general approach to properly use our
system should incorporate ethics considerations as
the first-order principles in every step of the system design, maintain a high degree of transparency
and interpretability of data, algorithms, models,
and functionality throughout the system, make software available as open source for public verification and auditing, and explore countermeasures to
protect vulnerable groups. In our ongoing and future work, we have kept increasing the annotated
dataset size, add more rounds of user correction
and validation, and iteratively incorporate feedback
from domain experts who have used the tool, to
create new benchmarks for retraining model and
conducting more systematic evaluations. We recommend caution of using our system output until a
more complete expert evaluation has occurred.
Bias in source. Furthermore, our system output may include some biases from the sources, by
way of biases in the peer reviewing process. In our
previous work (Yu et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015;
Zhi et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019), we have aggregated source profile, knowledge graphs and evidence for fact-checking across sources. We plan
to extend our framework to include fact-checking
to enable practitioners and researchers to access to
up-to-the-minute information.
Bias in test queries. Finally, the queries (i.e.,
the lists of candidate drugs and proteins/genes) are
provide by the users who might have bias in their
selection. Addressing the user’s own biases falls
outside the scope of our project, but as we have
stated in the previous subsection, we direct users
to carefully examine source information (author,
publication date, etc.) and detailed evidence (contextual sentences and documents) associated with
the extracted connections.
