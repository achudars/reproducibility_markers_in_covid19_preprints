Abstract
In this paper, we propose a new model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our approach consists of seven phenotypes: the susceptible humans, exposed humans, infectious humans, the recovered
humans, the quarantine population, the recovered-exposed and deceased population.
We proved first through mathematical approach the positivity, boundness and existence of a solution
to considered model.
We also studied the existence of the disease free equilibrium and corresponding stability. Hence, the
actual reproduction number was calculated .
We analyzed the dependence of basic reproductions R0 on the confidence of our model. Our work
shows, in particular, that the disease will decrease out if the number of reproduction was less than
one. Moreover, the impact of the quarantine strategies to reduce the spread of this disease is discussed.
The theoretical results are validated by some numerical simulations of the system of the epidemic’s
differential equations.

1 Introduction
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan City on December 2019, the opinions of
scientists, researchers and commen- tators contradict each other every day. On 7 January, the coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) which was named as a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020, was
identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities [12], and has become a pandemic especially by
travelers [11]. This forced the World Health Organization (WHO) to consider the dramatic spread of
the infection in March 2020 as a public health emergency of international concern. This epidemic is
characterized by its rapid spread and its symptoms do not appear quickly. In particular, accord- ing
to the WHO, the incubation period is from 2 days to 14 days [12]. In addition, there is no anti-viral
treatment or vaccination officially approved for the management or prevention of this epidemic. In
order to fight this outbreak, the public health decision and policy makers should decide and follow
strategic and health-care management. Since the declaration of the first case of COVID-19 in Tunisia

in early March 2020, thousands of screenings have been carried out in Tunisia. Following the first
recommendations of the WHO Tunisia, as France, Italy or Spain, first opted for rare and targeted
screenings on suspicious people, their entourage and certain sources of contamination; in particular
for people arriving from abroad. Next, If a person is positive, the authorities try to trace all the people
with whom he has been in contact and they are called to place themselves in self-containment without necessarily being tested. They can only be tested if they themselves have symptoms of COVID-19.
It is clear that the low number of screenings, mainly on "suspect" cases or those presenting significant symptoms, does not give a precise idea of the number of people who could potentially be
infected without knowing them. This gap between the day of infection and the day of diagnosis can
have serious consequences on the spread of the epidemic. All this shows the complexity of the situation
since the unknown things related to the epidemic are more important than the things we already know.
These are the daily question that must be answered: how many people exactly recover from COVID19? How many people are infected from COVID-19? How many people died from COVID-19?
Recently, several mathematical models have been published in order to be able to study the dynamics and the evolution of this pandemic. One can refer to [3, 5–9] and their references. It appears
from clinical experiences and recent articles that knowing the data of infected people in the population
would be very useful to have better models of when disease will peak and decline, and also when we
can begin to let people go back to work. Also, knowing the real number of recovered people also could
indicate how easily people can build immunity against the virus.
Motivated by the above discussion our method comprises seven phenotypes; the susceptible humans, exposed humans, infectious humans, the recovered humans, the quarantine population, the
recovered-exposed and the dead population in order to improve and adapt the susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR ) model. In fact, we noticed that people previously infected and recovered from COVID19 are generally excluded as susceptible individuals in the modeling, which would have an impact on
predicting the number of cases that will occur in the near future. In our approach we chose to integrate
them into the model as a recovered-exposed population and which we will note Er . In addition, at
the individual level, if people can find out if they have been or slightly infected and cured, and if they
show civility and respect the distancing, they can safely return to work once the general quarantine
is off.

Our main contributions in this paper are:
We gave a model of dynamical behavior of COVID-19 in Tunisia.
We studied the qualitative properties of our model.
We established the stability of equilibrium point via R0 .
We proved theoretically and by numerical simulations the effect of quarantine strategy.

The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our model. Section 3 is
devoted to the mathematical analysis: Boundness, positivity, and the equilibrium point. the dynamics
of exposed and infected population are also studied in this section. In Section 4, via Matab, we
perform numerical simulations of three types of populations. Section 5 concludes the paper with some
recommendations.
2 Mathematical model
The classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model in epidemiology [4] allows the determination of critical condition of disease development in the population irrespective of the total population
size over a short period of time. The SIR is considered from the following simplest ODE system:

= − SI,

λ
for the sizes of the susceptible sub-population S, infected I, and recovered R. The term IS describes
N
the disease transmission rate due to the contacts between susceptible and infected individuals, βI characterizes the rate of recovery of infected people. It is assumed here that the recovered individuals do
not return to susceptible class, that is, recovered individuals have immunity against the disease; they
cannot become infected again and cannot infect susceptible either.
Day by day, we see that the specifics of this virus require more complex models. Roughly speaking,
it is necessary to question the duration of the incubation, or the presence of people who do not have
symptoms after their infection, but who nevertheless participate in the spread of the virus and consider
compartments for these different cases. In our work, we have used a 7- Phenotype model which takes
into account people who are infected, exposed, recovered, those susceptible, the deceased, Quarantine
but also recovered-exposed people who are not counted by the government.
The interaction between the above sub-populations can be described by the compartmental diagram in Figure 2.1. The parameters indicated in Figure 1 are described in Table 1.

3.1.1 The boundness and positivity of the solution
Theorem 1
Given the non-negative initial conditions (3.2), then the solutions S(t), E(t), I(t), Er (t),R(t), D(t)
and Q(t) are non-negative for all t ≥ 0 and bounded.
Proof
First, let us prove that the solution of the system (3.1) is positive.
1st case:
Suppose that ∃t1 > 0 such that
S(t1 ) < 0,
S(t) > S(t1 ); ∀t < t1 ,
I(t), E(t) > 0; ∀t ≤ t1 .
Then we have

2nd case:
Suppose that ∃t1 > 0 such that
S(t1 ), E(t1 ) < 0,
E(t) > E(t1 ), S(t) > S(t1 ); ∀t < t1 .
Then we have
0≥

dE(t1 ) dS(t1 )

= −λ3 S(t1 ) − (α1 + α2 )E(t1 ) > 0, absurd.

From the second case; S and E are not both negative as the same time.
3rd case:
Suppose that ∃t1 > 0 such that
I(t1 ) < 0,
I(t) > I(t1 ); ∀t < t1 ,
E(t) > 0; ∀t ≤ t1 .
Then we have
0≥

dI(t1 )
= α1 E(t1 ) − (β1 + β2 )I(t1 ) > 0, absurd.

4th case:
Suppose that ∃t1 > 0 such that
E(t1 ) = 0,
E(t) > 0; ∀t < t1 ,
S(t), I(t) > 0; ∀t ≤ t1 .
We can write E as the following form
E(t) = e

5th case:
Suppose that ∃t1 > 0 such that
E(t1 ) = I(t1 ) = 0,
E(t), I(t) > 0; ∀t < t1 ,
S(t) > 0; ∀t ≤ t1 .
We can write E as the following form

which is impossible.
Then, we get E, I and S as positive functions. Therefore, we get Er , R, D and Q as increasing
functions. Thus, we have Er ,R, D and Q as positive functions.

Now, we prove that the solution is bounded. From the positivity of the solution, we have the
following inequality
dS
≤ −λ3 S(t),
dt
dS

≤ −m1 (S + E); where m1 = min{λ3 , α1 + α2 }.
dt
dt
Then, by integrating
S(t) ≤ S(0)e−λ3 t ,
E(t) + S(t) ≤ (S(0) + E(0))e−m1 t .
We can deduce that S(t) ≤ S(0) and E(t) ≤ S(0) + E(0), for all t.
By the same way, we get
E(t) + S(t) + I(t) ≤ (S(0) + E(0) + I(0))e−m2 t ; where m2 = min{λ3 , α2 , β2 + β2 }.
Then, I(t) ≤ S(0) + E(0) + I(0) for t ≤ 0.
For Er ,R, D and Q, using the recent inequalities, we have

dR
≤ β1 E(t) + S(t) + I(t)
dt
≤ (S(0) + E(0) + I(0))e−m2 t ; where m2 = min{λ3 , α2 , β2 + β2 },

dD
≤ β2 E(t) + S(t) + I(t)
dt
≤ (S(0) + E(0) + I(0))e−m2 t ,
dQ
≤ λ3 S(0)e−λ3 t .
dt
From integrating
α2
Er (t) ≤ Er (0) +
(S(0) + E(0)),
m1
S(0) + E(0) + I(0)
,
R(t) ≤ R(0) + β1
m2
S(0) + E(0) + I(0)
,
D(t) ≤ D(0) + β2
m2
Q(t) ≤ Q(0) + S(0).
Thus, the proof is given.
3.1.2 Existence and uniqueness of the solution
Theorem 2 (Existence and Uniqueness)
Under the conditions the model (3.1) possesses a unique solution.
Proof Let us define the matrix norm by |||.||| where for A ∈ R7 × R7 :
|||A||| = ρ(A) and ρ(A) represents the largest eigenvalue of matrix A.
Firstly, the function X ∈ R7 7→ AX + f (X) is continuous.
Pose X = (S, E, I, Er , R, Q, D) and Y = (S 0 , E 0 , I 0 , Er0 , R0 , Q0 , D0 ). From the bounded solution, we
get

Then, the Cauchy-Lipschitz is satisfied. And consquently, the model (3.1) possesses a unique solution
[1].

3.2 Disease free equilibrium, Reproduction number R0 and extinction of infected population
At the disease-free state, there is no disease in the human population which implies E = I = R =
D = Q = Er = 0. Thus, the disease-free equilibrium of the model (3.1) is given by
(S 0 , E 0 , I 0 , Er0 , R0 , D0 , Q0 ) = (N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).
We can also verify whether or not the state-point is stable. In our case, according the positivity of
our model, we have from the first equation of system (2.2)
S(t) ≤ S(0)e−λ3 t −→ 0
t→+∞

(6= N ).

As a result, the state-point is unstable.
Now, let us calculate the basic reproduction number R0 which is the average number of secondary
infections caused by an infectious individual during his or her entire period of infectiousness (Diekmann
et al) [2]. The basic reproduction number is an important non-dimensional quantity in epidemiology
as it sets the threshold in the study of a disease both for predicting its outbreak and for evaluating
its control strategies.
Using the next generation operator approach by van den Driessche and Watmough [10], we have
R0 =

λ1 (β1 + β2 ) + α1 λ2
.
(α1 + α2 )(β1 + β2 )

And we have the corresponding effective control reproduction number defined as in [2]
R0 (t) =

λ1 (β1 + β2 ) + α1 λ2
S(t).
N (α1 + α2 )(β1 + β2 )

(7)

This quantity provides us with a clear index to evaluate the control strategy for any time t.
Theorem 3 If R0 < 1 , then exposed and infected population will extinct.
Proof Let us define the Lyapunov functional
V (t) = λ2 I(t) + (β1 + β2 )E(t).
The derivative of V is given by
·

·

·

V (t) = λ
2 I(t) + (β1 + β2 )E(t),

= α1 λ2 + λ1 (β1 + β2 ) − (α1 + α2 )(β1 + β2 ) E(t),


≤ α1 λ2 + λ1 (β1 + β2 ) − (α1 + α2 )(β1 + β2 ) V (t).
Thus,

V (t) ≤ V (0)exp


α1 λ2 + λ1 (β1 + β2 ) − (α1 + α2 )(β1 + β2 ) t ,

where V (0) = λ2 I(0) + (β1 + β2 )E(0). Therefore, for R0 < 1 we have α1 λ2 + λ1 (β1 + β2 ) − (α1 +
α2 )(β1 + β2 ) < 0. Then
V (t) −→ 0 i.e lim I(t) = 0 = lim E(t).
t→+∞

t→+∞

This shows that the disease will be extinct if R0 < 1.

t→+∞

3.3 The effect of quarantine strategies
As most countries of the world, Tunisia fights vigorously against the spread of the COVID-19
epidemic with some disabilities such as the lack of medical equipment. Therefore, in order to brake
the spread of this emerging epidemic the general quarantine is adopted. In addition, since the number
of beds in intensive care in the hospital is reduced and insufficient, the infected population is not fully
hospitalized except in cases with fairly severe symptoms. Besides, the rest of the population should
respect total isolation. The natural question here is : What is the impact of this decision in other
words this quarantine strategy?

By equation one in the system (2.2), the susceptible population can be evaluate from the following
expression

S(t) = e

It is clear that the parameter λ3 reduces the number of people exposed to infection with the disease.
From the evolution of exponential function, we can deduce that when the rate λ3 is getting bigger,
the susceptible population is getting smaller.
When the λ3 = 0, we have this diagram

which implies that the disease almost infected every susceptible person.
This theoretical result which justifies the quarantine strategy will be consolidated by a numerical
study in the following paragraph.

And for stimulation, we chose the following initial condition: S(0) = N-E(0)-I(0), E(0) =200, I(0)
=18, Er (0) = R(0) = D(0) = 0.
In addition to the population plots in figures 2 and 3, we collected some meaningful quantitative
information about the model parameters (table 1) and the peak values for infected and exposed populations (table 3).
The results can be summarized as follows:

Peak infected
day Number(%)
38 648(5, 9.10−3 )

Peak exposed
day Number(%)
12 3405(3, 1.10−2 )

Table 3: Infected and exposed peak values in Tunis region.

And we have R0 < 1, therefore the disease will disappear.

Fig. 3: Exposed population

Fig. 4: dead population
The human body needs around 10 days to get rid of the organism. However, cases where the body
needed 21 days to get rid of symptoms are detected. So after the peak, it is logical that the rate of
recovered population increases. Then we can get the following figures.

From figures 2 and 5, if the Tunisian people maintain this pattern. After 50 days, the exposed
population is fewer and the infected population surpasses the peak and decreases quickly. So, the
government of Tunisia can ease up the measures that it took in connection with the outbreak of the
epidemic like the general quarantine.

Now, let’s summarize by giving different cases in one figure in order to compare them.

Fig. 9: a) Infected population and b) Dead population with different λ3 = 0.166, 0.15, 0.13, 0.1
The change in the λ3 parameter generates a consequent variation in the rate of the infected
population and the deceased persons (fig. 8.a-h).
The most spectacular is the case λ3 = 0 which corresponds to Q = 0; or in other words, in the
absence of a quarantine strategy. We can see that on the 20th day of the epidemic we get 3, 75x105
infected people (fig. 9.a). This number is far above the capacity of health structures in Tunisia.
Consequently, the choice of containment strategy has significantly reduced the number of deceased
and infected persons.

5 Conclusion
In this article, we presented a new model based on nonlinear differential equations allowing to model
this COVID-19 in Tunisia. The aim of our work, at first, is to provide initial ideas and guidelines for a
quantitative and qualitative study of our considered model. In particular, the positivity, boundness and
the existence of a solution are established. The impact of the quarantine strategy is also established
by two methods. We hope our work motivates new research to produce more elaborate and precise
methods related to this model or to give significant improvements..
