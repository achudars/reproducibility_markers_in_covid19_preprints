Abstract One of the strategies in combating COVID19 consists of virtual screening for possible inhibitors for
the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding
domain (RBD) to the human ACE2 receptor. Here, we
performed a molecular docking study to propose potential candidates to prevent the RBD/ACE2 attachment. These candidates are sixteen different flavonoids
present in the peppermint leaf. Results showed that Luteolin 7-O-neohesperidoside is the peppermint flavonoid
with a higher binding affinity regarding the RBD/ACE2
complex (about -9.18 Kcal/mol). On the other hand,
Sakuranetin was the one with the lowest affinity (about
-6.38 Kcal/mol). Binding affinities of the other peppermint flavonoids ranged from -6.44 Kcal/mol up to
-9.05 Kcal/mol. The biding site surface analysis showed
pocket-like regions on the RBD/ACE2 complex that
yield several interactions (mostly hydrogen bonds) between the flavonoid and the amino acid residues of the
proteins. This study can open channels for the understanding of the roles of flavonoids against COVID-19
infection.

tus of a pandemic in March of 2020. Up to January of
2021, it has already infected more than 100 million people, leading to the death of more than 2 million ones
[6]. Since the earlier stages of this pandemic, a worldwide effort has been devoted to producing vaccines and
antiviral drugs to combat this virus. Some successful
investigations yielded vaccines that have started to be
applied very recently [7–15]. Despite the beginning of
vaccination, no consensus about an efficient treatment
for already infected patients has been reached so far.
Sars-CoV-2 has a crown-like (spherical) form, and
its surface protein (Spike) is directly involved in the
infectious process [16–18]. The receptor of this virus
in human cells is the angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) [19–21]. Sars-CoV-2 surface protein has two
subdivisions named S1 and S2, being S1 the receptorbinding domain (RBD) [22–25]. The RBD plays a major role in the attachment mechanism of Spike protein
to ACE2 [26]. After the attachment between them, the
virus enters the cell and starts the replication process
[22]. In this sense, the strategy of virtual screening for
possible inhibitors for the RBD/ACE2 attachment [27]
may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches for
the treatment of COVID-19.
Drug repurposing is a feasible way to combat diseases with some similarities [28–30]. In this scenario,
the use of phytochemicals is always an important option to be considered [31]. Among their sub-classes, the
flavonoids — a class of small molecules found in fruits,
vegetables, flowers, honey, teas, and wines — stand out
[32–34]. Their pharmacological properties include antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral functions [35–37].
Flavonoids have been employed as inhibitors for the
infection mechanism of several diseases [39]. Among
them, one can mention malaria, leishmaniasis, Chagas,

and dengue [40–45]. They have also been considered
in studies aimed at developing therapeutic approaches
for cancer treatment [46–48]. Very recently, it was reported that Luteolin (a flavonoid found in leaves and
shells) is efficient as an anti-inflammatory that can interact with the Sars-CoV-2 surface [49, 50]. More specifically, it is adsorbed in the Spike protein, inhibiting the
Sars-CoV-2 attachment to the ACE2, thus preventing
infection. Ngwa and colleagues used computer simulations to address the feasibility of Caflanone, Hesperetin,
and Myricetin flavonoids in acting as inhibitors for the
RBD/ACE2 attachment [51]. Their results pointed to
the ability of Caflanone in inhibiting the transmission
of the Sars-CoV-2 virus from mother to fetus in pregnancy. Pandey et. al. conducted molecular docking and
dynamics simulations considering ten flavonoid and nonflavonoid compounds (by using phytochemicals and hydroxychloroquine, respectively) to verify their performance in inhibiting the RBD/ACE2 interaction [52].
Their findings indicate that Fisetin, Quercetin, and Kamferol molecules couple to RBD/ACE2 complex with good
binding affinities. In this sense, they can be explored
as possible anti-Sars-CoV-2 agents. Despite the success
of these molecules inhibiting the RBD/ACE2, other
flavonoids should be tested to broaden the list of possible inhibitors and to confirm their potential in developing new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of
COVID-19.

dates are sixteen different flavonoids present in the Peppermint (Mentha piperita) leaf [53–59]. Peppermint is
a perennial herb and medicinal plant native to Europe widely used for treating stomach pains, headaches,
and inflammation of muscles [54, 58, 59]. Well-known for
their flavoring and fragrance traits, peppermint leaves
and the essential oil extracted from them are used in
food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products [53–56].
Our results revealed that Luteolin 7-O-neohesperidoside
is the peppermint flavonoid with a higher binding affinity regarding the RBD/ACE2 complex (-9.18 Kcal/mol).
On the other hand, Sakuranetin was the one with the
lowest affinity (about -6.38 Kcal/mol). Binding affinities of the other peppermint flavonoids ranged from
-6.44 Kcal/mol up to -9.05 Kcal/mol. These binding
affinities are equivalent to other ones reported in the
literature for the interaction between flavonoids and the
RBD/ACE2 complex [49, 50, 60–67]. Moreover, the biding site surface analysis showed pocket-like regions on
the RBD/ACE2 complex that yield several interactions
(mostly hydrogen bonds) between the flavonoid and the
amino acid residues of the proteins. Definitively, experimental studies and clinical trials should be further performed to evaluate the efficacy of these compounds in
the inhibition of the RBD/ACE2 attachment.

Herein, in silico molecular docking analysis was carried out to propose potential flavonoid candidates in
preventing the RBD/ACE2 attachment. These candi-

Since Sars-CoV-2 infects human cells through the RBDACE2 coupling, the idea of checking for small molecules
that may inhibit this interaction is recurring and can be

useful to propose a combatant drug [68]. Here, we used
molecular docking to study the interaction between the
peppermint flavonoids with the RBD/ACE2 complex.
Below, we present the proteins, inhibitors (flavonoids),
and the computational protocol involved in our study.

2.2 Ligand Preparation

2.1 Protein Preparation

The peppermint leaf contains sixteen flavonoids [53, 56],
classified into three subcategories: Flavones (Flavonols),
Flavorings, and Flavanones [53, 56]. The flavonoids studied here are Acacetin, Apigenin, Apigenin 7-O-neohesperidoside (Apigenin*), Chryseoriol, Hesperidin, Hesperitin, Ladanein, Luteolin, Luteolin 7-O-glucoside (Luteolin*), Luteolin 7-O-glucuronide (Luteolin**), Luteolin
7-O-neohesperidoside (Luteolin***), Narigenin, Pebrellin, Sakuranetin, Thymusin, and Xanthomicrol. Their
3D structures were extracted from PubChem [69]. The
chemical structures of these flavonoids can be seen in
figure 2, while relevant information such as PubChem
ID, molecular weight, molecular formula, and subcategory of the flavonoid is presented in table 1.

Figure 1 presents the main proteins involved RBD/
ACE2 interaction that were obtained from Protein Data
Bank, ID 6M0J [38]. In the left panel of this figure,
the ACE2 protein is in blue, while the RBD Sars-CoV2 one in red. Three essential regions of inhibition between these proteins were highlighted with the black
squares 1, 2, and 3. In the right side of Figure 1 we
show the binding site surface colored as gray, red, blue,
and white for carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen
atoms, respectively. The yellow rectangle highlights the
total surface for inhibition with a clear cavity within
region 2.

2.3 Molecular Docking Simulation
Molecular docking consists of computationally analyze
the non-covalent binding between macromolecules (receptor) and small molecules (ligand). Here, the macromolecule is the RBD/ACE2 protein complex (Figure
1), while the ligands are the sixteen flavonoids present
in the peppermint leaf (Figure 2). SWISSDOCK server
was used for the docking simulations [70, 71]. In SWISSDOCK, the docking energies are obtained through the
CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular
Mechanics) force field [70, 71] using a blind docking
strategy that spans over 100 trial configurations for
each target/ligand input [72]. The target/ligand configuration with higher binding affinity is selected using the UCFS CHIMERA software [73], a visualization
tool capable of directly import data from the SWISSDOCK server. Finally, the Protein-Ligand Interaction
Profiler (PLIP) server [74] is used to characterize the
target/ligand interaction for the configuration with a
higher binding affinity for each flavonoid regarding the
RBD/ACE2 complex.

3 Results
After successful docking of the peppermint flavonoids to
the RBD/ACE2 complex, several modes of ligand/target
interactions were generated with a particular docking
score (binding affinity). The biding mode with the least
biding energy is regarded as the best one, once it tends
to be the most stable. The binding affinity results (∆G)
obtained here are summarized in Table 2. SWISSDOCK
simulations for all the ligands in Figure 2 revealed significant biding affinities with the target RBD/ACE2
proteins. Luteolin 7-O-neohesperidoside is the pepper-

mint flavonoid with a higher binding affinity regarding the RBD/ACE2 complex (about -9.18 Kcal/mol).
On the other hand, Sakuranetin was the one with the
lowest affinity (approximately -6.38 Kcal/mol). Binding affinities of the other peppermint flavonoids ranged
from -6.44 Kcal/mol up to -9.05 Kcal/mol. As one can
note in Tables 1 and 2, the best docked flavonoids have
greater molecular weight. All the binding affinities are
close to the ones reported for the RBD/ACE2 interaction with other species of flavonoids [49, 50, 60–67].
Moreover, they can outperform the binding affinities
reported by docking studies using other types of compounds targeting RBD/ACE2 [63, 75–81], such as Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, which are lower than
-8.0 Kcal/mol [63]. This fact can be attributed to the
abundant phenolic hydroxyl group in flavonoids. The
hydroxyl group in the sugar group of flavonoids tends

to bind more easily with the heteroatoms of amino acids
from RBD/ACE2, as will be shown later. In this sense,
the peppermint flavonoids can compose the list of potential phytochemical inhibitors for the RBD/ACE2 interaction.
Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the biding site surface
(BSS) for the putative best docking target/ligand configurations. For the sake of clarity, these figures show
the BSS only for the RBD/ACE2 region highlighted
by the yellow rectangle in Figure 1(b). The following
color scheme is adopted for the BSSs: gray, red, blue,
and white for carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen atoms, respectively. In the ball-stick representation
for the flavonoids, the carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen

atoms are shown in the colors cyan, red, and white, respectively. As a general trend, one can note that the
flavonoids fit inside the core pocket region (cavity) of
the RBD/ACE2 complex. This cavity is displayed as region 2 in Figure 1(a). Acacetin, Luteolin∗ , Luteolin∗∗ ,
Thymusin, and Xanthomicrol were adsorbed on region
1 (see Figure 1(a)) of the RBD/ACE2 complex. The ligands tend to interact with the oxygen atoms (red spots
in the BSS) in regions 1 and 2. These regions establish
pocket-like media that yield interactions (mostly hydrogen bonds) between flavonoids and amino acid residues
of proteins.
Figures 5 and 6 provide a clear picture of the interaction between the amino acid residues of the proteins

and peppermint flavonoids. The docked poses (obtained
using PLIP [74] show the residues names and the bond
types. In the stick representation of flavonoids, the carbon and oxygen atoms are in the orange and red colors, respectively. The hydrogen, hydrophobic, and πstaking bonds are denoted by the blue, dashed gray,
and dashed yellow lines, respectively. The yellow sphere
represents the charge center. In Figure 5 one can note
that Acacetin, Apigenin, Apigenin∗ , Chryseoriol, Hesperidin, Hesperetin, Ladenein, and Luteolin interact with
RBD/ACE2 mainly through 4, 5, 5, 6, 12, 5, 4, and 8 hydrogen bonds with distinct amino acid residues in both
RBD and ACE2 proteins. Similarly, Figure 6 shows the
interaction mechanism between Luteloin∗ , Luteloin∗∗ ,

Luteloin∗∗∗ , Naringenin, Pebrellin, Sakuranetin, Thymusin, and Xanthomicrol with RBD/ACE2 is mediated
by 7, 5, 9, 8, 5, 5, 4, and 4 hydrogen bonds with distinct amino acid residues in both RBD and ACE2 proteins, respectively. In total, 12 hydrophobic bonds were
found. The flavonoids and amino acid residues of the
proteins involved in this kind of interaction are highlighted below. Some π-stacking bonds are also present
in the RBD/ACE2 interactions with flavonoids expecting for the Hesperidin (Figure 5(e)), Luteolin∗ (Figure
6(a)), and Xanthomicrol (Figure 6(h)) cases.
Generally speaking, we identified 31 distinct amino
acid residues of the RBD/ACE2 interacting with the
peppermint flavonoids. The RBD amino acid residues

In summary, a set of phytochemicals (peppermint flavonoids) were screened against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
receptor-binding domain interacting with the human
ACE2 receptor. The approach is based on computationally fitting small molecules for the target RBD/ACE2
complex proteins using the 3D structure of the active
site with SWISSDOCK [70, 71], subsequently the ranking of the docked compounds with Quimera [73] and
interaction analysis with PLIP [74]. Results revealed
that Luteolin 7-O-neohesperidoside is the peppermint
flavonoid with a higher binding affinity regarding the
RBD/ACE2 complex (about -9.18 Kcal/mol). On the
other hand, Sakuranetin was the one with the lowest affinity (about -6.38 Kcal/mol). Binding affinities
of the other peppermint flavonoids ranged from -6.44
Kcal/mol up to -9.05 Kcal/mol. These values outperform the binding affinities reported by docking studies
using other types of compounds in which the RBD/
ACE2 complex was also the target. The biding site surface analysis showed pocket-like regions on the RBD/
ACE2 complex that yield several interactions (mostly
hydrogen bonds) between the flavonoid and the amino
acid residues of the proteins. The interaction mechanism between the flavonoids and amino acid residues of
the proteins is mediated by hydrogen bonds, essentially.
The presence of some hydrophobic and π − stacking
bonds was also observed. In total, we identified 31 distinct amino acid residues of the RBD/ACE2 interacting
with the peppermint flavonoids. The target RBD/ACE2
amino acid residues for this class of phytochemicals are
ARG375, ASN15, and GLU19 from ACE2, and ARG668
from RBD, based on their higher occurrence.
