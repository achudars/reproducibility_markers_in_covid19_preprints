We find that the opinion leaders who emerge after a crisis are assumed to have local knowledge about the incident and/or are able to quickly curate information about the incident. In addition, we find that the quality of information spread by opinion leaders is critical to narrative construction and civility. The largely fact-based narratives associated with the FSU incident were far more civil than the OSU narratives, which were based on disinformation and polemics. We conclude the article by calling on scholars to take a more nuanced approach to conceptualizing and studying opinion leaders.",TRUE,FALSE,civility|crisis|incivility|journalists|mass media|opinion entrepreneurs|opinion leaders|school shootings|trolls,2020-08-13T15:15:23.099752,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-13T15:15:02.759589,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements",SAGE,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qydvs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qydvs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qydvs/citation/,qydvs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qydvs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qydvs/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qydvs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3552b9d42ad40061cdb1fe/,5f3552b9d42ad40061cdb1fe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qydvs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qydvs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qydvs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qydvs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qydvs,NA

In its cultural and political project to defend the Second Amendment, the National Rifle Association (NRA) embraced New War culture, a counter-cultural response to the trauma of the war in Vietnam, which extended warrior honor to armed men defending their families from an increasingly hostile world and a suspect government that might try to disarm them. Using textual analysis of the American Rifleman, we explore how the NRA co-opted narratives of soldiers' sacrifice for the nation to promote  a New War cultural message.  We find that magazine contributors retooled the traditional narrative to feature non-military protagonists, to differentiate the nation from the government, and to spotlight freedom as a sacrificial cause. With their strong civil religious overtones, the NRA's sacrifice narratives served as value-laden signposts that elevated the Second Amendment to a sacred God-given freedom, extended the consecration from sacrifice to encompass their mainstream audience of gun owners, and identified political and cultural enemies. These classic American narratives of soldiers’ sacrifice for the nation were thus co-opted to deliver a simultaneously patriotic and anti-government counter-cultural message that would resonate with mainstream American culture.",TRUE,FALSE,American Rifleman|blood sacrifice|civil religion|culture change|freedom|gun rights|narratives|narrative transformation|New Warrior culture|NRA|sacrifice|second amendment|Vietnam War|Wayne LaPierre,2020-09-06T03:21:32.234431,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-06T03:21:06.705440,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2g7zh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2g7zh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2g7zh/citation/,2g7zh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2g7zh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2g7zh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2g7zh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f35336bd42ad40056cda022/,5f35336bd42ad40056cda022,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2g7zh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2g7zh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2g7zh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2g7zh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2g7zh,NA

The first step widely applied at any archaeological site (and/or at field laboratories) is the gross removal of sediment from the surfaces of artifacts. Lithic surface alterations due to mechanical action applied in wet or dry cleaning regimes have never been examined at a microscopic scale. This could have important implications in traceology, as any modern surface modifications inflicted on archaeological artifacts might compromise their functional interpretations. The current trend toward quantification of use-wear traces makes the testing even more important, as even slight, apparently invisible surface alterations might be measured.

In order to evaluate the impact of common cleaning procedures, we undertook a controlled experiment. The main aim of this experiment was to assess the effects that brushing actions applied for removing sediment particles have on flint and quartzite surfaces.

All surfaces were analyzed with confocal microscopy before and after having been brushed to quantify possible changes in the micro-topography. Surface roughness parameters (ISO 25178-2 among others) were applied.

Nine parameters changed significantly when mechanical actions were applied to lithic surfaces, meaning that some changes in the surface micro-topography were detected. Therefore, archeologists need to be cautious when applying prolonged mechanical actions for cleaning archaeological stone tools.",TRUE,FALSE,Brushing|Cleaning protocols|Confocal microscopy|Stone tools|Use-wear analysis,2020-08-15T22:35:02.553941,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-15T22:34:48.559668,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3632490|https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3632517|https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3873124,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfrj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfrj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfrj/citation/,4sfrj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfrj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfrj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfrj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3531e93bf2520039a2136c/,5f3531e93bf2520039a2136c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfrj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfrj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfrj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4sfrj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4sfrj,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.06.031

Extant survey evidence portrays online participation as a weapon of the strong, wielded by a highly politically involved, white, and affluent subset of the American electorate. Surveys face systematic sampling and measurement errors in the domain of political participation, though. In this study, I revisit this question using individual voter registration records that I integrate with observed Twitter activity. Based on a large sample that reflects Florida’s voting-eligible population, I find that political involvement on Twitter is prevalent across the electorate and extends to those most likely to abstain from voting. Moreover, race and income, which are salient dividing lines in voting, do not structure social media-based political participation.

Another key trend, political polarization, has been important in understanding this relationship, exemplified most recently by the election of the strongly anti-immigrant and racially inflammatory presidential candidate, Donald Trump. This article explores the contemporary relationship between race, immigration, and political polarization by analyzing several key components of said relationship. Echoing past research, we find that racial and immigration attitudes are increasingly split along political party lines. We also show that, although the positive correlation between racial resentment and restrictive immigration attitudes has generally increased in recent times, 2016 saw an uptick in this correlation, a finding that is likely related to the mobilization of these issues in 2016. Again paralleling prior research, we show that both conservative racial attitudes and restrictive immigration attitudes were strong predictors of Trump voting among non-Hispanic Whites, both in the general and primary elections, and even controlling for voting patterns in the 2012 general election, highlighting the unique connection between Trump and these issues. Overall, these findings point toward an increased importance of race and immigration in the current political climate.",TRUE,FALSE,2016 presidential election|Donald Trump|immigration|political polarization|race,2020-08-13T06:34:14.911371,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-13T06:33:46.527366,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://gss.norc.org/|https://electionstudies.org/|https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910/DVN/GDF6Z0,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Michael Hout and Christopher Maggio,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7q2w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7q2w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7q2w/citation/,p7q2w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7q2w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7q2w/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7q2w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f348a8c3bf252000ba1dfa3/,5f348a8c3bf252000ba1dfa3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7q2w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7q2w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p7q2w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p7q2w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p7q2w,NA

COVID-19 data are typically presented cumulatively and by only one demographic characteristic. Understanding and communicating complex demographic trends is imperative to recognize population-level vulnerabilities and inform tailored public health responses. Using the latest COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we aim to: a) assess one dimension of reporting quality-- data completeness; and b) examine national time-trends in the age pattern of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths overall as well as by race and ethnicity.

Against this backdrop, a growing number of researchers have begun to adopt a wider lens on organizational networks, shifting the focus to collective, or whole network, performance. Yet, efforts to understand the relationship between whole network structure and whole network performance have produced conflicting findings, which suggests that a different approach may be needed. Drawing on macrostructural sociology, we propose a ""whole network morphology"" framework, which argues the whole network structure-performance relationship is contingent on other fundamental—relational and cultural—whole network dimensions. Subsequently, we undertake an application of our framework, through which we demonstrate how a morphological view helps address conflicting findings on the structure-performance relationship. Leveraging data on 350 million physician relationships, we study 250 whole networks known as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). Consistent with previous work, we do not find a clear association between structural connectedness and performance. However, we find that a more disconnected network structure is associated with negative ACO performance when the relational strength of network ties is high. We also find evidence of better ACO performance in the presence of a physician cultural orientation when the whole network is more connected.",TRUE,FALSE,accountable care organization|ACO|blau|healthcare networks|network morphology|network performance|networks|organizational networks|whole networks,2020-08-13T06:33:42.409009,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-13T06:33:27.484058,FALSE,NA,no,Publicly available data is linked with restricted data from Medicare.,,no,This study was not preregistered.,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",K.

The spatial sciences have recently seen growing calls for more accessible software and tools that better embody geographic science and theory. Urban spatial network science offers one clear opportunity: from multiple perspectives, tools to model and analyze nonplanar urban spatial networks have traditionally been inaccessible, atheoretical, or otherwise limiting. This paper reflects on this state of the field. Then it discusses the motivation, experience, and outcomes of developing OSMnx, a tool intended to help address this. Next it reviews this tool's use in the recent multidisciplinary spatial network science literature to highlight upstream and downstream benefits of open‐source software development. Tool-building is an essential but poorly incentivized component of academic geography and social science more broadly. To conduct better science, we need to build better tools. The paper concludes with paths forward, emphasizing open-source software and reusable computational data science beyond mere reproducibility and replicability.",TRUE,FALSE,geocomputation|geographic data science|geography|GIS|GIScience|graph theory|network science|network theory|open data|open science|open source|openstreetmap|OSMnx|replication|reproducibility|social science|spatial networks|street networks|transportation|urban geography|urban informatics|urban planning|urban science|urban theory,2020-08-12T21:09:39.243212,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-12T21:08:55.075588,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dec|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Transportation",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d267g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d267g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d267g/citation/,d267g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d267g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d267g/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d267g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f344a718e0d46001abe6fcb/,5f344a718e0d46001abe6fcb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d267g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d267g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d267g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d267g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d267g,https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12678

For conservation social scientists, the pandemic has necessitated swift changes to research methods, including shifting away from in-person data collection. Social survey data are key to integrating perspectives and knowledge from a variety of social actors in order to more effectively manage and conserve ecosystems. In-person survey methods have long been considered an indispensable approach for reaching certain populations (e.g., low-income), those without an available sampling frame (e.g., birders), or those defined by place (e.g., park visitors). However, these methods became infeasible for many researchers during the pandemic, as they may during other times of social upheaval. Additionally, response rates across multiple survey modes have been steadily declining over decades, requiring that researchers consider new approaches. Conservation social scientists are now turning to online surveys at a rapid rate, but they must do so while ensuring rigor in this data collection mode. Further, they must address a suite of unique challenges, such as the increasing use of mobile devices by participants and avoiding bots or other survey fraud. This paper charts a course for high-quality online survey research for conservation social scientists through review of recent literature and our own experiences as survey researchers. We provide direction for scientists moving their surveys online, with examples from a recent national study of people who feed wild birds, in which an online survey was implemented through a survey panel and a sample generated via a project participant list. We also make recommendations for research funders, journal editors, and policymakers using survey-based science, who can all play a role in assuring that high-quality survey data are used to inform effective conservation programs and policies.",TRUE,FALSE,conservation|methods|social science|web-based survey,2020-08-12T21:09:41.136858,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-12T21:09:25.461145,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,Chloe Wardropper|Ashley Dayer|Madeline Goebel|Victoria Martin,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g753n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g753n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g753n/citation/,g753n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g753n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g753n/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g753n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3431b9b798bb0057e17bf2/,5f3431b9b798bb0057e17bf2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g753n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g753n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g753n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g753n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g753n,NA
