However, a major challenge is sustaining such groups, which tend to decline following the initial upsurge immediately after emergencies. The present study investigates one possible motivation for continued participation: the wellbeing benefits associated with psychological membership of groups, as suggested by the ‘social cure’ approach. Interviews were conducted with 11 volunteers in a mutual aid group organised by ACORN, a community union and anti-poverty campaigning organisation. Through qualitative analysis we show that participation provided wellbeing in different ways: positive emotional experiences, increased engagement in life, improved social relationships, and greater sense of control. Participants also reported some negative emotional experiences. Whilst all interviewees experienced benefits from participation, those who viewed their participation through a political lens were able to experience additional benefits such as feelings of empowerment. Moreover, the benefits conferred by a shared political identity appeared to be qualitatively different from the benefits conferred by other forms of shared identity. The interview data is used to hypothesise an overall process by which participants may come to attain a political identity via mutual aid. These findings have implications for how such groups retain their members and how authorities support these groups.",TRUE,FALSE,Activism|Covid-19|Groups|Mental Health|Mutual Aid|Social Identity|Subjective Wellbeing,2020-11-22T22:12:40.865133,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-22T22:12:30.900876,FALSE,NA,no,Research data are not shared.

On the one hand, social media platforms offer workers and trade unions the possibility to mobilize across geographical and institutional distances. On the other hand, these platforms also allow third parties to extract and process the digital traces of this communication about interest representation (e.g. Tweets). The aim of this paper is to introduce a specific form of processing – “Predictive Risk Intelligence” – as a new research object. Predictive Risk Intelligence providers use social media data to make predictions about events such as strikes and protests. They make these predictions available to other actors – for example, companies – as a service. In this paper, we introduce the phenomenon of Predictive Risk Intelligence through a case study of a provider of these services. Based on the case study, we develop a set of research questions related to established and new actors in the field of interest representation in value-creation networks.

Unfortunately, approaches using poverty rates to assess the causes and consequences of poverty do not fully capture the components of change in the poverty population. This is because changes in the conventional poverty rate can occur due to processes of natural increase, migration, or transitions in and out of poverty. This paper presents an accounting framework for changes in poverty within and between places. The framework, termed the poverty balancing equation, generates a series of summary statistics which can be used in place of the conventional poverty rate in future research. The approach is then demonstrated using the 2014 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation to generate state-level estimates of the poverty components of change for three states in the American South between January and December of 2013. Results show that even when poverty rates remain constant, there is significant dynamism within poor and non-poor populations.

One hypothesis is that humans like those parts of nature more that they know better. Using questionnaires, we studied the familiarity of 475 students with 91 urban animal species and the relationship between familiarity and attitude towards the species. Students were familiar with most animals, but not all animals were equally liked. Better-known species were not generally the better-liked ones. The more familiar animal species were on average, the more extreme attitudes became towards them, both positive and negative. For several animal species, there were significant differences in attitudes between men and women. Foreign students were less familiar with species occurring in German cities than German students, and there were some differences in attitudes. Our research shows that familiarity and attitude are not two sides of the same coin. It also emphasizes that there are parts of nature that are not liked by many humans and that this dislike is not necessarily correlated with insufficient knowledge.

Such analyses ignore potential differential fertility and family formation processes and exclude childless individuals. Ignoring the demographic process underlying transmission introduces selection bias into estimates of the intergenerational transmission of criminal justice contacts insofar as the first generation’s criminal history affects family formation and the probability of parenthood. In this study, we use a cohort of all Danish men born 1965-1973 including complete fertility information and criminal justice history to account for bias caused by differential selection into fatherhood across criminal histories. We demonstrate that seriousness of criminal justice involvement is associated with earlier transition to fatherhood but ultimately higher levels of childlessness. Criminal activity prior to the onset of transition to fatherhood predicts ultimate childlessness. Conditioned on becoming a father, men with criminal justice histories have a similar number of children as men without a history of criminal justice contacts. Ultimately, the findings suggest that existing estimates of the intergenerational transmission of criminal justice contacts are overestimated when considered at the population level due to differential probability of ever becoming a father.",TRUE,FALSE,administrative data|family|fatherhood|intergenerational transmission,2020-11-22T00:39:01.822237,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-22T00:38:48.404134,FALSE,NA,no,"Some micro-data used to generate macro-level numbers not publically available, but can be accessed through agreement with Statistics Denmark.

The COVID-19 pandemic can exacerbate the already existing socio-economic gaps between family structures. To investigate this issue, we analyze how experiences and concerns vary across living arrangements along two dimensions that may be associated with social disadvantage: loneliness and care. In doing so, we employ quantitative text analysis on open-ended questions from novel survey data on a sample of about 1,100 individuals living in Germany. We focus our analyses on four different household structures: Living alone, shared living without children, living with a partner and children, and single parents. We find that single parents (who are primarily single mothers) are at the high risk of experiencing care-related worries, particularly regarding their financial situation, while individuals living alone are most likely to report feelings of loneliness. Those living in shared houses, with or without children, had the lowest risk of experiencing both loneliness and care-related worries. These differences in the experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic can contribute to widening socio-economic gaps by family structure in the upcoming years.",TRUE,FALSE,children|content analysis|Corona|COVID-19|experience|Germany|household|loneliness|partnership|topic models,2020-11-20T02:51:41.765961,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-20T01:51:49.661450,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://data.gesis.org/sharing/#!Detail/10.7802/2034,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6c42q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6c42q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6c42q/citation/,6c42q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6c42q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6c42q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6c42q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fb69f3677aa65030c94a70e/,5fb69f3677aa65030c94a70e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6c42q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6c42q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6c42q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6c42q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6c42q,NA
