In response to such closures, many countries decided to continue offering education through distance learning. Similarly, Sultan Qaboos University (SQU), the only government university in Oman, opted for asynchronous teaching through Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT).  Through ERT, there is a temporary shift in instructional delivery. Its primary aim is to provide temporary access to instruction and support materials quickly and reliably during the crisis.  Asynchronous teaching provides students with flexibility to access the materials posted by teachers whenever they can, leaving teachers with many challenges. One of these challenges is the ability to offer proper feedback to students. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the perceptions of both teachers and students on the electronic feedback provided in ERT. A total of 8 teachers 80 students enrolled in the foundation program at SQU participated in the study. The responses of both teachers and students were collected through online questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The findings of the study indicate that some feedback methods seemed to be more effective. The study also identified the challenges faced by both students and teachers in terms of electronic feedback.

Language teaching in L2 contexts also had to shift to the online mode without compromising the quality of teaching and learning.  This paper examines the perceptions as well as the performance of the participants involved in the online International English Language Testing System (IELTS) course offered by Middle East College, Muscat, Oman via MS Teams, an online teaching platform. Most IELTS courses offered online focus on the improvement of exam techniques; however, the developers of this course designed a syllabus based on a needs analysis to cater to the specific needs of the candidates, which would not only improve their test-taking strategies but also develop their writing skills. Adopting the Test, Teach, Re-test method, a diagnostic test was conducted initially, followed by teaching interventions and post-tests.  Interviews with teachers, feedback from students, a comparison of diagnostic test scores with exit level scores, and the use of corpus linguistic methods to examine lexicogrammatical features were carried out to determine the effectiveness of the online course. The results indicated that those students who were not motivated performed poorly, whereas the high achievers were those who engaged in self-study and were, to some extent, autonomous learners.

Firmly established in the English for Specific Purposes teaching and learning practice developed in Oman’s tertiary education, this paper explores a skill-based teaching approach ascribable to its far-reaching partnership with Oman 2040 vision initiative, and 21st-century educational thinking and planning for the future. In particular, while debating current issues related to economic and digital transformation, it aims at examining student skill development in the context of an English for Specific Purposes classroom using Omani tertiary education students’ self-perceived responses. Students responded to a survey that investigated perceptions of transferable skill importance, self-efficacy, and opportunities for improvement. The results reveal that adaptability/flexibility, time management, oral communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving are the most essential student perceived transferrable skills concerning their future employability and professional success; however, the perceived opportunities to use and improve these skills as well as satisfaction with the ability to use them in the course vary, and, therefore, should be addressed when considering further development of the English for Business course curriculum and its delivery.

Most of the educational institutions here have responded swiftly to fulfill the requirements of academia by switching to an online emergency remote teaching mode overnight. To get adjusted to the ‘new normal,’ teachers across all academic disciplines, including the English language, have had to adapt to new teaching approaches and learn new skills and competencies to confront this challenge. This empirical cross-sectional research study explores the teacher technology self-efficacy, the challenges faced, and the innovative practices adopted by the EFL teachers during the crisis. A mixed-methods approach was used here, including an online survey and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with six teachers. The survey was administered to 100 EFL teachers from fourteen higher-education institutions, whereas the interviews were held with six survey participants. The study found that majority of the teachers had a strong sense of self-efficacy in using technology as well as considerably positive learning experiences and novel innovations, which all resulted in the various ways they faced pandemic-related challenges.

To engage students in this newest reform, significant preconditions of democratic school culture are set as effective outcomes to generate ethical behaviors. Today, social and political issues tend to provide meaningful opportunities to engage students in proper activities, specifically by using project-based learning. This paper aims at examining important venues that Moroccan school leaders, along with the bachelor outcomes, wish to implement to foster democratic participation within and outside school life by adopting project-based learning. It questions the challenges and perspectives of this implementation along with the progress of Moroccan educational institutions. Hence, the paper adheres to a meta-analysis technique, whereby a unique examination of the various already conducted studies came out with conclusions: perspectives and challenges. The typical meta-analysis method disengages readings of various scholarly academic sources related to school effectiveness concerning the implementation of project-based instruction, specifically after a long journey of debates about the bachelor.

I arrive at this finding from detailed examination of the net fertility of 130,000 married couples in Ireland circa 1910, a country known for its historically high fertility rate. After stringently accounting for the occupation, religion and location of couples, I find higher fertility rates among couples who chose distinctly Catholic names and traditional names for their children, with the latter being particularly important. Exposure to towns and cities lowered net fertility and weakened preferences for traditional and Catholic names. Cumulatively, these findings highlight the role of traditional rural norms over explicitly religious influences in driving high fertility rates in Ireland.

The case of university associations,"How do organizational associations affect extra-organizational boundaries? This chapter addresses this question by looking into the long-established practice among universities to form associations. In order to examine how associations delineate boundaries in universities’ institutional environment, the chapter draws on the scholarly work on categories and conceptualizes associations as meta-organizations. The chapter finds that category-based identities, and other organizational characteristics, enacted to demarcate members from non-members play a central role in this process. In following these lines of demarcation on a sample of 185 national and international university associations a typology emerges, accompanied by a global diffusion pattern. Three sets of institutional conditions are then identified as being conducive to this process: (1) the twentieth-century university expansion and the consolidation of national higher education fields, (2) the intensification of cross-border interaction and the advent of international institutions, and (3) the formation of a global field and the rise of competition as an ideological imperative.",TRUE,FALSE,boundaries|categories|meta-organization|organization|universities,2021-03-07T15:45:28.199228,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-07T15:45:05.435801,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9unb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9unb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9unb/citation/,p9unb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9unb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9unb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dxewb/,dxewb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9unb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6044b3b26a10eb00732a5574/,6044b3b26a10eb00732a5574,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9unb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9unb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9unb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p9unb/,https://doi.org/10.1108/S0733-558X20180000057010,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p9unb

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the surveillance practices of non-Western countries have often been analyzed from the perspective of the West, impacting domestic surveillance policymaking and public perception. However, we rarely know how Western societies’ surveillance practices and discourses may impact how people in non-Western societies understand their own domestic surveillance.

Unlike most existing models or explanations of terrorism that attempt to explain stages or factors associated with the radicalization of individuals, the proposed theory aims to identify the dominant causal pathway behind the onset of Salafi extremism. Kosovo was used as a control group to establish Saudi Arabia-originated Wahhabism’s dominance as a radicalization source. Wahhabism gives particular importance to the theme of Sharia as the law of the land. The theory’s independent, dependent, and causal variables are public support levels for religious leaders as religious judges, the radical agenda they espouse, and the idea of Sharia as the law of the land, respectively. A linear regression analysis of the published data from 20 nations reveal that the Sharia platform acts as a causal mediator between the independent and dependent variables as well as a moderator of the radicalization phenomenon. Moreover, the computed coefficients of determination for the public support levels for Sharia and religious leaders and Sharia and a radical agenda, of 0.85 and 0.86, respectively, suggests that the Sharia platform constitutes the dominant causal pathway. Thus, the belief in Sharia as the law of the land, as advocated by religious leaders, provides the basis for radicalization and the emergence of Salafi jihadist groups.",TRUE,FALSE,extremism|Kosovo|radicalism|Salafism|Saudi Arabia|theory,2021-03-07T15:41:21.075272,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-07T15:41:05.759521,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd4xq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd4xq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd4xq/citation/,nd4xq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd4xq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd4xq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd4xq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6043cc5751a4a6006176e1bc/,6043cc5751a4a6006176e1bc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd4xq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd4xq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nd4xq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nd4xq/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nd4xq
