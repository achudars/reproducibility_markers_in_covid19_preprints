The textbook was published by Macmillan, and it was specially developed for use within Saudi Arabia’s cultural environment and for both boys’ and girls’ schools. The Ministry of Education has started using this textbook in schools in the current academic year 2013/2014. This study will focus on teachers’ perspectives, and it will be a macro evaluation. The researcher designed a mixed method study by gathering both quantitative and qualitative data. The researcher distributed a close-ended questionnaire consisted of 55 items and nine categories for 30 teachers to gather quantitative data and carried out an interview with five male teachers to gather qualitative data. The study evaluated the textbook in terms of the layout and design, objectives, skills, supplementary materials, topics and content, cultural values, structure and vocabulary, activities and tasks, and teachers’ manual. In general, the findings of the study revealed that teachers were satisfied about the textbook in all of the nine categories with some demerits. The cultural values category got the highest mean score of 4.54 out of 5.00 whereas the skills category got the lowest mean score of 3.47 out of 5.00. In the light of these findings, the researcher reports some recommendations to address the drawbacks of the textbook and other problems that have an impact on properly delivering the textbook.",TRUE,FALSE,ELT|mixed method study|primary school|Teachers` perspective|Textbook evaluation,2019-07-20T21:27:01.594140,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:26:42.644456,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knd2r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knd2r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knd2r/citation/,knd2r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knd2r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knd2r/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knd2r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5d001ee16f5500178ef869/,5c5d001ee16f5500178ef869,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knd2r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knd2r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/knd2r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/knd2r/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.226,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/knd2r

To conduct the analysis, the researcher selected a sample covering the preamble and the three main parts of the Convention representing legal texts in general. Throughout the analysis, every translation shift was traced and manually counted to identify the most frequent type of translation shifts. The inevitability of each of the identified shifts was examined to conclude how necessary translation shifts were to preserve the meaning and effect of the source text. The findings indicated that intra-system shifts were the most frequent type of shifts with the frequency of 174 shifts (=26.6%), followed by unit shifts scoring 171 shifts (=26.3%), then structure shifts with the frequency of 161 shifts (=24.6%), then class shifts being identified 128 times (=19.6%), and finally level shifts with the frequency of 19 shifts (=2.9%). Regarding the inevitability of resorting to translation shifts, 80.1% (=523 cases) of identified translation shifts were obligatory due to the linguistic disparities between English and Arabic. Only 19.9% of detected (=130 cases) were optional due to the technicality of legal texts.

In general, it is a space and place study. The thesis suggests that, Antoinette has some conditions and circumstances that she developed in an autonomic manner with different experiences in order to navigate and recognize the dangerous and safe spaces around her. Wide Sargasso Sea, by Jean Rhys, elaborates a self-sacrifice experience that the protagonist went through in her search for identity, which she lost due to the circumstances around her. In this research, a psychological analysis of Antoinette's personality will be taken, moreover; an attempt is made to find out the reasons for her schizophrenic behavior. The research focuses on Antoinette's shattered identity and the specters she faced in her life, which ultimately played a huge role in her madness. Also, the visible opposite aspects of black/white, rationality/unconsciousness, male/female, and sanity/madness are conceived by her conscious mind, and it causes the frantic thoughts of insanity, womanhood, and blackness. Also, it sheds light on Antoinette's journey in life to figure out where she belongs and her struggle in this search. Antoinette's personality and identity crisis as a Creole girl will be discussed in depth. There are different areas that are explored in this paper; such as the interpretation of how the surrounding spaces affect Antoinette and the reasons behind the absence of a loving mother in Wide Sargasso Sea. Furthermore, Rochester's character is also examined to find out how the masculine space differs from feminine space, and to what extent Mr. Rochester's cruelty harms Antoinette. Another important thing that is discussed in the paper is the effect of family relationships on a person's identity, and how it becomes a reason of mental disorder.",TRUE,FALSE,Black|Identity|Madness|Schizophrenic behavior|Spaces|White,2019-07-20T21:26:05.014568,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:25:40.088984,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/citation/,dsgxj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5cfdbb76653c001b2cc625/,5c5cfdbb76653c001b2cc625,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dsgxj/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.228,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dsgxj

The Role of Emotion, Race, and Politics in Social Movement Perceptions and Support","Scholars have long studied how social movements frame and deliver their messages, yet much less is known about how these “signals” are received by the public. In this study, we ask whether and how social movement members’ characteristics interact with a bystander’s to influence whether they support a particular protest movement. In addition, we examine how perceived likelihood of violence mediates these outcomes. We test five competing models based on previous theories of emotion, race, and political views in social movement support. To adjudicate between these frameworks, we conduct an experiment using a 2x2 factorial design in which participants read a news story about a protest accompanied by an image of a neutral/angry, white/Black protestor, measuring three types of social movement support. Results provide support for the politicized race model: a Black protestor is more motivating for liberals’ social movement support, while a white protestor is more motivating for conservatives. Both liberals and conservatives are more likely to associate the protest with violence after seeing a Black protestor compared to a white one. Racialized perceptions of violence explain part of conservatives’ hesitancy to support the movement when seeing a Black protestor and inhibits part of the otherwise-positive effect of seeing a Black protestor for liberals.",TRUE,FALSE,culture and cognition|emotions|politics|race and ethnicity|social movements,2019-02-08T14:20:07.607190,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-08T13:45:44.384225,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Lauren Valentino &amp; D.

However, the practitioners' perspective on relevance has received very little scholarly attention to date. This paper puts forward a theoretical model for examining how practitioners construct academic knowledge as practically relevant based on interviews with practitioners enrolled on executive MBA (EMBA) courses. The model shows that practitioners construct academic knowledge as relevant by (1) perceiving it as congruent with their context, experiences and intuition, (2) extending their knowledge by new instruments, constructs, and means of scientific framing and (3) reconnecting it to their contexts and professional practices. This model extends the literature by showing that, in order to be considered practically relevant, academic knowledge needs to balance novelty and continuity. Additionally, the paper shows that practitioners are unlikely to perceive as relevant ambiguous academic knowledge that is 'action expansive', i.e. that presents them with an overwhelming range of possible actions.",TRUE,FALSE,mangement education|Practical relevance,2019-02-08T14:14:29.063773,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-08T13:43:47.700991,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,Violetta Splitter,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/citation/,v4su8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5c48d6832ca60017ad90a6/,5c5c48d6832ca60017ad90a6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v4su8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v4su8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v4su8

A critique of using fixed-effects regression to estimate the effects of personal contacts on wages,"There is an ongoing controversy about whether the correlation between job finding via personal contacts and wages reflects a causal effect. Critics such as Mouw (2003) argue that controlling for unobserved confounders, preferably by fixed-effects regressions, removes spurious correlations and reveals the actual null effect of personal contacts. More recently, however, McDonald (2015) applied fixed effects regressions and found a significantly positive effect. In this paper, we argue that both the Mouw (2003) and McDonald (2015) results are subject to sample selection. Results are potentially biased because their fixed effects estimators exclude those persons who use only one job search method. We propose difference-in-differences matching as an alternative estimator that does not induce the same sample selection bias. Re-analyzing the data used in Mouw (2003) and McDonald (2015), we find that in both cases, this alternative estimator is unbiased by unobserved confounders as well as by sample selection and gives us a causal null effect, which supports Mouw`s (2003) original argument.",TRUE,FALSE,causal effect|fixed effects regression|panel data|personal contacts|propensity score matching|replication analysis|social networks|wages,2019-02-08T04:09:27.382851,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-08T04:08:24.592880,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/citation/,8ynbc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5c0cad832ca60019a9dcea/,5c5c0cad832ca60019a9dcea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8ynbc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8ynbc/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8ynbc

A common and influential way to understand symbolic boundaries is as widely shared understandings of what types of behaviors, tastes, and opinions are appropriate for different kinds of people. Scholars following this understanding have mostly focused on how people judge others and how symbolic boundaries align with and thus reproduce social differences. Although this work has been impressive, I argue that it might miss important ways in which symbolic boundaries become effective in everyday social life. I therefore develop an understanding of how symbolic boundaries affect people’s ideas and decisions about themselves and their own behavior. Based on this, I argue that focusing on boundary violations—that is, what happens if people express opinions or enact behavior that contravenes what is considered (in)appropriate for people like them—might offer an important way to understand how symbolic boundaries initiate and shape cultural and social change.

This is the main puzzle raised in this paper. The argument is that the decision to stage elections and democratize is highly strategic and depends on the ethnic size of the post-conflict government leader. Especially post-conflict leaders with large ethnic support are able to utilize quick post-conflict elections to stabilize and legitimize their political position. However, in the long run the government leaders prefer institutions that maximize their time in office and therefore will hinder full scale democratization. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the timing of elections and democratization depend on the ethnic support of the new government and the civil war outcome.",TRUE,FALSE,Authoritarian Regimes|Civil war|Democratization|Elections,2019-02-08T04:07:41.756917,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-08T04:07:06.206140,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/citation/,va795,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ngc6a/,ngc6a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5c042ae16f5500178e0d4c/,5c5c042ae16f5500178e0d4c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/va795/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/va795/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/va795

Determining and understanding these identities is important because research shows that who a person believes themselves to be has implications for how they approach their healthcare, along with their emotional and physical wellbeing.
Design: We employed a qualitative narrative approach. We then used thematic narrative analysis to identify emergent identities across stories gathered from hearing aid users. These themes allowed us to assign emergent identities to the hearing-aid users.
Study Sample: Thirty adults with hearing loss who reported using their hearing aids during all waking hours.
Results: Five identities emerged from the hearing-aid users’ narratives: 1) the satisfied user, 2) the overcomer, 3) the dispassionate user, 4) the frustrated and resigned user, and 5) the griever.
Conclusions: These findings are a first step to improving theoretical and clinical insights into the perspectives and experiences of satisfied hearing-aid users following diagnosis of their hearing loss and their hearing aid fittings. Such insights could ultimately improve hearing healthcare providers’ abilities to employ person-centered care while helping adults with hearing loss seek out, implement, and adhere to treatment.",TRUE,FALSE,hearing aids|hearing loss|identities|narrative sensemaking|thematic narrative analysis,2019-02-07T20:24:47.217767,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-07T20:23:18.866242,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,authors,in press,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh9zg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh9zg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh9zg/citation/,yh9zg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh9zg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh9zg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rbfjs/,rbfjs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh9zg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5bce96832ca60018aace67/,5c5bce96832ca60018aace67,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh9zg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh9zg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yh9zg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yh9zg/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yh9zg
