Using a detailed coding instrument, we analyzed how opioid-related research was covered by US and Canadian online news media in 2017 and 2018, at the height of the crisis. We find that opioid-related research is not frequently mentioned in online news media, but when it is, it is most often framed as valid, certain, and trustworthy. Our results also reveal that the media predominantly present research findings without context, providing little information about the study design, methodology, or other relevant details—although there is variability in what kind of news stories mention opioid-related research, what study details they provide, and what frames they use.

While the average age and educational attainment of workers in these occupations has increased significantly since the 1970s, many of these occupations offer low wages, along with limited fringe benefits and opportunities for advancement. These occupations also employ a disproportionate share of Black and Hispanic women. Using longitudinal data from the 2004 and 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation which provide occupational data over a four year timespan, we evaluate the prevalence of occupational mobility by sex, race, and ethnicity. This research shows there are racial disparities in occupational mobility, with Black and Hispanic women less likely to exit retail and service occupations than White, non-Hispanic women. Educational attainment increased the likelihood of occupational mobility. Hispanic women’s lower levels of educational attainment depressed their occupational mobility, while longer job tenure increased the likelihood they would be occupationally mobile. Differences in human capital and job tenure did not explain mobility disparities between Black and White, non-Hispanic women. However, unionization reduced occupational mobility and partly accounts for Black women’s lower rates of mobility. Black women were more likely to be unionized and unionization was associated with decreased occupational mobility among women. Workers in unionized retail and service occupations earned higher wages, reducing the incentive to leave and lowering their occupational mobility rate.",TRUE,FALSE,occupational mobility|race and ethnicity|retail|service|women's employment,2019-07-24T13:11:04.709808,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24T12:23:03.907116,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/citation/,ykufd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kj8dx/,kj8dx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3761725d2cdc0019078056/,5d3761725d2cdc0019078056,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ykufd/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ykufd

This study extended the understanding of bicycle mode choice and the influence of built form through an analysis of dwelling type, density, and mode choice. Apartment dwelling and active transportation are related to intensification, but an understanding of the impact of increased density on bicycling is muddied by the lack of isolation of cycling from walking in many studies and by the lack of controls for the confounding effects of dwelling type. This study examined the relationship between dwelling type and mode choice in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In this study of 223,232 trips, 25 variables were controlled for, and multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to estimate relative risk ratios. Strong evidence was found that a trip that originated from an apartment-based household was less than half as likely to be taken by bicycle as a similar trip that originated from a house-based household in Toronto in 2011. Increased population density of the household location had a positive impact on the likelihood that a trip would be taken by walking and a negligible and uncertain impact on the likelihood that it would be taken by transit. However, increased population density had a negative impact on bicycling. Further analysis found that the negative impact of density did not seem to apply to those who lived in single detached housing but rather only to the likelihood that apartment and townhouse dwellers would cycle. Further research is required to identify the exact barriers to cycling that apartment dwellers experience.",TRUE,FALSE,apartments|bicycle|density|mode choice|Toronto,2019-07-24T11:03:46.304196,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24T10:05:25.251181,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Trudy Ledsham|Steven Farber|&amp; Nate Wessel,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/citation/,nvg64,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d371272251f0e001809ac7a/,5d371272251f0e001809ac7a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nvg64/,https://doi.org/10.3141/2662-08,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nvg64

Participants evaluated the perceived prestige of regional variations in accented speech using a pool of candidate scale items generated from free-listing tasks and a review of published scales. Through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, we find that our resulting 7-item scale, composed of dimensions we term position, reputation, and information, or “PRI,” exhibits good model fit, scale validity, and scale reliability.

We exploited the seasonal demand for album stickers related to the FIFA World Cup Russia 2018. In our within-subjects design, experimenters carried out in-person audits and quoted a pre-determined list of missing stickers. They interacted with 59 sticker vendors located in five geographic clusters. We find that prices quoted to foreign buyers are higher than prices quoted to Colombian buyers. By contrast, we do not find evidence supporting direct gender-based discrimination, neither that vendors charge a higher price per sticker when the list of missing stickers is shorter. We complement the study with a qualitative analysis based on interviews that reveal vendors' pricing strategies, their awareness of price discrimination, and the trade of counterfeits.",TRUE,FALSE,discrimination|dual labor markets|football|sports|street vendors,2019-07-24T11:05:23.214484,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24T09:57:07.191233,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r5hf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r5hf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r5hf/citation/,6r5hf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r5hf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r5hf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gzhfs/,gzhfs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r5hf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d361fe1251f0e0018091046/,5d361fe1251f0e0018091046,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r5hf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r5hf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6r5hf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6r5hf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6r5hf

the consent that is granted when relating sexually with other people. We can see that all the people
surveyed have felt passed to take their consent, either in contexts of intimacy, as in public social
contexts. In certain cases, the limits at the moment of consent become confusing due to the
ingestion of narcotics, but respect and responsibility are essential, that is why it is important to
enact affective responsibility through a sex-affective education that makes us responsible subjects
