The Political Orientation of Professors, Professionals and Managers in Europe","Universities are accused of being left-wing bastions, unwelcoming to conservative and right-wing professors. However, we know little about the political orientation of professors in comparison to other professionals, which would be the right comparison group if we want to know whether universities are potentially hostile environments to conservatives. Examining culturally and economically oriented political orientations in Europe, it is demonstrated that professors are more liberal and left-leaning than other professionals. However, there is no greater homogeneity of political orientations among the professoriate relative to other specific professions, suggesting that there is a diversity of opinions which is similar to what professionals would find in other occupations. One exception concerns attitudes towards immigration, on which professors have more liberal orientations and comparatively low residual variance around that more liberal mean. Importantly, the difference between professors and other professionals is not so clear within graduates from the social sciences, but emerges more clearly among graduates with a medical, STEM, economics or law degree.

Studies have paid little attention to independent mechanisms that reduce emissions. Statistical properties of the data undermine the estimation techniques used in many studies. To address these shortcomings, we used novel methods and panel data integrating emissions, economic, and energy-system characteristics across 70 economies over 1970-2013 to derive a universal GDP-emissions relationship and identify key emissions-reduction mechanisms. We found that, robust to a variety of estimation procedures, every 1% increase in GDP was associated with a 1% increase in CO2 emissions when controlling for other mechanisms. Emissions reductions were mainly driven by four mechanisms: (i) energy system decarbonization, (ii) increased economic efficiency, (iii) electrification, and (iv) deindustrialization. A 1% increase in these factors was associated with 0.2-1.8% reductions in CO2 emissions per year; together, these factors contributed to 18 petagrams of emissions reduction globally over 1970-2013.

Public Management meets Public Sector Machine Learning,"Public bodies and agencies increasingly seek to use new forms of data analysis in order to provide 'better public services'. These reforms have consisted of digital service transformations generally aimed at 'improving the experience of the citizen', 'making government more efficient' and 'boosting business and the wider economy'. More recently however, there has been a push to use administrative data to build algorithmic models, often using machine learning, to help make day-to-day operational decisions in the management and delivery of public services rather than providing general policy evidence. This chapter asks several questions relating to this. What are the drivers of these new approaches? Is public sector machine learning a smooth continuation of e-Government, or does it pose fundamentally different challenge to practices of public administration? And how are public management decisions and practices at different levels enacted when machine learning solutions are implemented in the public sector? Focussing on different levels of government: the macro, the meso, and the 'street-level', we map out and analyse the current efforts to frame and standardise machine learning in the public sector, noting that they raise several concerns around the skills, capacities, processes and practices governments currently employ.

Such shortest-paths are time-dependent and not always stable from one moment to the next. Given that actual transit passengers necessarily have imperfect information about the system, their route selection strategies are heuristic and cannot be expected to achieve optimal travel times for all possible departures. Thus an algorithm that returns optimal travel times at all moments will tend to underestimate real travel times all else being equal. While several researchers have noted this issue none have yet measured the extent of the problem. This study observes and measures this effect by contrasting two alternative heuristic routing strategies to a standard shortest-path calculation. The Toronto Transit Commission is used as a case study and we model actual transit operations for the agency over the course of a normal week with archived AVL data transformed into a retrospective GTFS dataset. Travel times are estimated using two alternative route-choice assumptions: 1) habitual selection of the itinerary with the best average travel time and 2) dynamic choice of the next-departing route in a predefined choice set.  It is shown that most trips present passengers with a complex choice among competing itineraries and that the choice of itinerary at any given moment of departure may entail substantial travel time risk relative to the optimal outcome. In the context of accessibility modelling, where travel times are typically considered as a distribution, the optimal path method is observed in aggregate to underestimate travel time by about 3-4 minutes at the median and 6-7 minutes at the \nth{90} percentile for a typical trip.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|modelling|public transport|route-choice|Toronto Transit Commission|transit|transportation|travel|travel behaviour,2019-04-19T20:49:27.855992,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-19T20:48:58.370921,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Nate Wessel &amp; Steven Farber,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/citation/,3r4p6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/aud86/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/relationships/node/,aud86,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cba2daaf2be3c00170b8832/,5cba2daaf2be3c00170b8832,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3r4p6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3r4p6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3r4p6,NA

However, political parties do not often endorse their demands. Even the centre-left, which is known for its redistributive policies, does not necessarily ally itself with the student opposition to fees. In this article, I focus on the impact of social movement- organised labour alliances on the opposition of political parties to government policy. I argue that such alliances have a unique impact on centre-left parties, especially in relation to non-labour issues. I present two examples of this alliance, emerging from the quite different political contexts of Germany and Turkey. In Germany, student movements failed to block the introduction of tuition fees in 2006. However, in 2008-2011, after students established a deeper alliance with organised labour, tuition fees were scrapped. In Turkey, student movements had been protesting tuition fees for a quarter of a century before an alliance with labour gained the support of social democrats in 2011. These case studies suggest that labour-movement alliances are effective in shifting social democratic politics in higher education policy because of the labour's experience and know-how in alliance building with centre-left parties and the student mobilization's potential to make tuition fees an electoral issue cross-cutting party allegiances. This finding suggest that scholars need to take the degree of engagement in opposition alliances into account, in addition to union density, in order to more accurately measure the political power of the organised labour. This point has implications for analysing a variety of policy outcomes in policy areas exposed to permanent austerity measures.",TRUE,FALSE,Germany|Social Movements|Student Protest|Trade Unions|Tuition Fees|Turkey,2019-04-19T20:50:12.837516,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-19T20:49:36.391747,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/citation/,vnbf3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cba27b7f2be3c0019074130/,5cba27b7f2be3c0019074130,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vnbf3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vnbf3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vnbf3,https://doi.org/10.1177/0011392119865768

To show the potential of this approach, the group of 500 sociologists who have their biographies written in 10 or more languages within Wikipedia is studied. Computational methods were used to extract temporal, spatial and relational information from these biographies in order to construct a general historical account of the discipline. The analysis shows various structural patterns of 'collectively remembered' sociology: historical changes in the frequency of globally recognized sociologists, trends in gender composition, degrees of diffusion and centrality of the main referents, geographical concentrations of the discipline, disciplinary differentiation in networks of greater biographical connectivity, flows of biographical references between countries, and birth-death migration patterns. Considering the temporal evolution of these aspects, we distinguish five generations of sociologists who shared similar collective circumstances. The record of high concentration (in terms of geography, gender and schools of thought) evidenced by the passing of these generations is highlighted.

We also elucidate how this cross-fertlization was mediated by the institutional structure of the university. We outline the role of key scholars such as Kenneth Arrow and Robert Wilson, as well as engineers turned administrators like Frederick Terman. We show that engineers largely drew upon successive economic theories of decision and allocation with a view to improving practical industrial management decisions. Reciprocally, economists found in engineering the tools (from linear programming to optimal control theory) they needed to rethink production and growth theory, an epistemology of “application” that emphasized awareness to institutional details, trials and errors and experiments to improve the design of processes and machines, and all sorts of industrial settings to operationalize their theories of decision, strategic interaction and bargaining. By the 2000s, they had turned into economic engineers designing markets and other allocation mechanisms. These cross-disciplinary exchanges were mediated by Stanford’s own institutional culture, notably its use of joint appointments, the development of multidisciplinary “programs” for students, the ability to attract a variety of visitors every year, the entrepreneurial and contract-oriented vision of its administrators, and the close ties with the industrial milieu that came to be called the Silicon Valley.",TRUE,FALSE,Arrow|economics|Engineering|History of Economics|History of Economic Thought|SocArXiv|Stanford,2019-04-19T00:10:41.476008,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-19T00:10:32.948961,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,authors,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/citation/,adtbj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb8f615a3bc970018f5ada1/,5cb8f615a3bc970018f5ada1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/adtbj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/adtbj,NA

Local adaptation measures, such as early warning systems for floods (EWSFs), are urgently needed to reduce the risk and impact of flood events. The aim of this study was to assess community perceptions and self-reported actions in response to flooding in a tropical coastal city to inform flood risk reduction policies and programs.
Methods: This qualitative case study was conducted in flood-prone areas in Machala, Ecuador, a coastal city exposed to seasonal floods and extreme floods during El Niño events. Adult community members from three periurban sites were invited to participate. Focus groups discussions (11 focus groups in total) were held with community members (n=65 people) from September to November 2014 to assess perceptions of flood exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and current alert systems. Focus groups discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded by topic; participatory maps were field validated, georeferenced, and digitized using GIS software. 
Results: Community members identified the presence of annual flooding during the rainy season, as well as greater than normal flood events (depths ranging from 0.5 to 3 meters), which recurred every 3-4 years in some communities. The deepest floods occurred during the 1982 and 1997/1998 El Niño events. Community members perceived that exposure to flooding depended on the rainfall coinciding with high ocean tides, and geographic proximity to blocked drainage areas, canals, and low local elevation. Participants reported that children were the most sensitive group due to increased susceptibility to skin infections and mosquito borne diseases (i.e., dengue fever). Other sensitive groups included the elderly, physically handicapped people, low-income families, and recent migrants. They identified persistent social-ecological vulnerabilities that increased flood risk and exposure in the urban periphery, such as inadequate access to garbage collection, homes settled in precarious low-lying geographies, economic barriers, lack of political access, and lack of social mobilization. In addition, communities expressed a lack of social capital (e.g. political voice), despite the existence of formalized community councils. Key neighborhood resources with respect to flooding included green areas, schools, nurseries, fire stations, health clinics, police stations, a retention wall (berm), and an emergency meeting place. Challenges for adaptive capacity existed primarily in actions related to the preparation and recovery stages of flooding. Despite the presence of an official flood warning system, community member relied on informal communication channels via social media. 
Conclusions: The flood vulnerability assessment framework and participatory research process utilized here can potentially inform studies in other flood-prone regions to guide the development of EWSFs and other climate change adaptation policies and actions.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|climate|community-based|early warning systems|Ecuador|El Niño|flooding|focus groups|Latin America|livelihoods|natural disasters|participatory GIS|urban|vulnerability,2019-04-19T00:13:32.116584,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-19T00:13:00.731145,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Latin American Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/citation/,ygh92,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kzm3e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/relationships/node/,kzm3e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb8bc4ea3bc970019f31cc2/,5cb8bc4ea3bc970019f31cc2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ygh92/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ygh92,NA
