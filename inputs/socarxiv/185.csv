While initial research established the relationship between populism and climate attitudes, data constraints limited the ability to test different causal pathways against each other. We argue that populist attitudes affect climate attitudes through two distinct channels, namely institutional trust and attitudes towards science. The former argument focuses on political institutions as the central actors in implementing climate policy. If one is to distrust these institutions, individuals are more likely to believe that climate change does not exist, is less dangerous than often portrayed, and/or that it isn’t attributable to humankind. The latter argument claims that populists deny climate change because they distrust the underlying climate science. According to this view, populists would view climate scientists as part of the self-serving elite that betrays the people. Utilising new data from the Austrian National Election Study and structural equation modelling, we find strong support for the relationship of populism and climate attitudes via attitudes towards science. The relationship via institutional trust is substantially weaker. Populists systematically hold more negative attitudes towards science and consequently deny climate change.",TRUE,FALSE,Attitudes towards Science|Climate Scepticism|Political Institutions|Populist Attitudes|SEM,2020-09-18T07:08:01.046340,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-18T07:07:41.071286,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.11587/QDETRI,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m82kg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m82kg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m82kg/citation/,m82kg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m82kg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m82kg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m82kg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f634d41b0d9a5005bcad353/,5f634d41b0d9a5005bcad353,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m82kg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m82kg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m82kg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m82kg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m82kg,NA

To analyse associations within the UK public between vaccine-related attitudes and knowledge about the role of antibiotics for treating various infections. 
Design:
Secondary analysis of a random-probability mixed-mode survey conducted by NatCen Social Research for the Wellcome Trust in late 2018.
Setting:
England, Wales, Scotland.
Participants:
2,708 members of the public recruited to the NatCen Panel from the British Social Attitudes random-probability survey.
Main outcome measures:
Ordinal logistic regression models of antibiotic-related knowledge predicted by vaccine attitudes, controlling for age, sex, education, employment status, geography, health information habits, perceptions of individual agency, and interview mode. The outcome variable was based on a question about the kinds of infections antibiotics are useful for treating. Vaccine-attitude outcomes were perceptions of the risk of serious side-effects from vaccination and perceptions of the efficacy of vaccination as a preventative intervention. 
Results:
Compared to the modal response category of ‘Fairly low’, respondents who rated the risk of serious side-effects from vaccination as ‘Very high’ (OR=3.34, 95% CL=2.13-5.25) or ‘Fairly high’ (OR=1.55, 95% CL=1.26-1.90) were more likely to have provided incorrect responses to questions about the utility of antibiotics for treating different types of infection. Conversely, respondents who felt that there was ‘No risk at all’ (OR=0.64, 95% CL=0.46-0.87) were less likely to have provided incorrect responses about the utility of antibiotics. Compared to the modal category of ‘Almost always effective’, respondents who felt that vaccines were ‘Sometimes effective’ (OR=1.25, 95% CL=1.05-1.49) as a preventative intervention were slightly more likely to have provided incorrect responses regarding antibiotics’ utility. However, there were no other significant associations between perceptions of vaccines’ efficacy and knowledge about antibiotics.   
Conclusions:
Perceptions of the risk of side-effects from vaccination and their understanding of the role of antibiotics for treating different infections are associated with one other within the general UK public. Research is needed to understand the nature of this association and identify areas of public understanding that are not exclusive to specific health interventions but that may be targeted to improve responsiveness to vaccine- and antibiotic-related public health interventions.",TRUE,FALSE,Antibiotics|Attitudes|Knowledge|Regression|Risk|Survey|Vaccine hesitancy|Vaccines|Wellcome Monitor,2020-09-17T01:48:03.030387,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-17T01:47:46.592468,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-monitor-2018-dataset-data-dictionary.xlsx.,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnadr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnadr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnadr/citation/,bnadr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnadr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnadr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnadr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f62258c1e8b9c02dee8fbe8/,5f62258c1e8b9c02dee8fbe8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnadr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnadr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnadr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bnadr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bnadr,NA

This study utilized monthly data from April 2004 to October 2017 of the Malaysian derivatives market. This study found that in the absence of an alternative profit-rate related benchmark and cross border activities, Islamic banks are constrained to use the interest rate benchmark. In the short run, both medium term (6-months) and longer term (12-months) tenures indicate faster speed of adjustment possibility due to higher trading volume and less demand for the medium term for the Islamic foreign exchange forward contract. It implies a need of the Islamic foreign exchange forward as a longer-term hedging instrument and not for a short term speculation and risk-taking purposes, as prohibited by shariah.",TRUE,FALSE,Islamic derivative market|Islamic foreign exchange forward|Islamic hedging|Malaysia|Malaysia derivative market|Risk management,2020-09-17T01:37:42.414845,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-17T01:37:03.031901,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtu7b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtu7b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtu7b/citation/,gtu7b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtu7b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtu7b/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/56wk9/,56wk9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtu7b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f61a4791e8b9c028ae9a603/,5f61a4791e8b9c028ae9a603,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtu7b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtu7b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtu7b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gtu7b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gtu7b,NA

The study utilizes the annual data over the period of 1970-2015. This study employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and causality using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The findings demonstrate the long and short-run associations between social capital and green growth in Malaysia. The causality only runs in a unidirection from social capital to the green economic growth. The findings have important policy implications for green economic growth measurement to account for social well-being and to fulfil the objectives of Islamic Sharia.",TRUE,FALSE,Consumption|Green Economy|Malaysia|Maqasid al-Shariah|Social Capital|Zakat,2020-09-17T01:31:42.060191,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-17T01:30:25.914664,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9zc2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9zc2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9zc2/citation/,g9zc2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9zc2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9zc2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eztuc/,eztuc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9zc2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f61a2b4b9173402e80ac26d/,5f61a2b4b9173402e80ac26d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9zc2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9zc2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g9zc2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g9zc2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g9zc2,NA
