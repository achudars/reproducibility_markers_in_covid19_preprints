It highlights gender and gendered parenting role attitudes as predictors of leave preferences. Descriptive results revealed sizable (i.e., 53%) support for leave availability and moderate (i.e., 33%) support for some government funding; still, only modest (i.e., 5 weeks) lengths of leave offerings were desired. Regression results indicated that women were typically more likely than men to support more generous leave offerings. Consistently, dual-earner expectations were positively associated with preferences for more generous leave offerings. Separate spheres attitudes appeared to be meaningful for women’s preferences, but not for men’s preferences.

Data collection, management, and analysis approaches are under-planned and, often, evolve during fieldwork. While reducing the amount of preparation time for busy researchers, these tendencies reduce the reliability of research by exacerbating the effects of cognitive biases and perverse professional incentives. They cost time later through the accrual of technical debt. Worse, these practices hinder research transparency and scalability by undermining the quality, consistency, and compatibility of data. Archaeologists would benefit from embracing the ""preregistration revolution"" sweeping other disciplines. By publicly committing to research design and methodology ahead of time, researchers can produce more robust research, generate useful and reusable datasets, and reduce the time spent correcting problems with data. Preregistration can accommodate the diversity of archaeological research, including quantitative and qualitative approaches, hypothesis-testing and hypothesis-generating research paradigms, and place-specific and generalizing aims. It is appropriate regardless of the technical approach to data collection and analysis. More broadly, it encourages a more considered, thoughtful approach to research design.

Abstract
Feminist theory revealed liberal democracy as gendered masculine in an intersectional way that privileges racial-ethnic and economic power, enforces heteronormativity, and constructs gender-binary citizenship. Merely reformed to accommodate women, brotherhood-breadwinner democracies now face deeper challenges. The second demographic transition undermines the hegemonic quality of binary gender relations, and organizes political conflict on an axis of reproductive politics. Germany’s Green and AfD parties exemplify opposite ends of this axis. Intersectional clusters of issues now reflect ideals that de-masculinize democracy, while reactionary populism re-politicizes masculinity to defend the family-state relations of the breadwinner-brotherhood gender system.",TRUE,FALSE,AfD|breadwinning|democratic systems|Germany|Green Party|masculinity|reproduction,2021-04-22T00:32:46.623157,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-21T18:42:30.986288,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5pbz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5pbz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5pbz/citation/,d5pbz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5pbz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5pbz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5pbz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6080709bc14695009a3967c9/,6080709bc14695009a3967c9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5pbz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5pbz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d5pbz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d5pbz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d5pbz

Evidence from Seattle's Democracy Voucher Program,"During each election cycle, the city of Seattle distributes four \$25 vouchers to every registered voter, which may be donated to and redeemed by campaigns for city office. Through a difference-in-differences research design, we study the causal effect of Seattle's program on various outcomes in city council elections in the first two cycles after implementation, with two comparison groups drawn from other cities in Washington and California. We find that the program led to an approximately 62-100% increase in total contributions and a 400% increase in number of unique donors. The effects on dollars and donors are entirely driven by small donors, defined as those who contribute less than $200 to a campaign. We find statistically insignificant evidence of decreases in private donations, although our point estimates suggest moderate-to-substantial crowd-out ratios. We further show that the program led to a 76-86% increase in candidates for city council.

Our data come from a survey of 3,329 firm employees and managers located in Venezuela, Ukraine and Egypt. On the whole we find that our respondents do not prefer to invest in companies with political connections. These results are highly conditional on the respondent's company: respondents from highly connected companies prefer to invest in companies with political connections, while respondents at less-connected companies prefer to invest in companies without political connections. We believe that what explains this finding are differences in how companies with and without connections manage liability as our survey data shows connected companies are much more likely to employ informal rather than formal mechanisms to resolve disputes.

Relationships are identified between individuals who live in the same household, live close to each other, work for the same company, attend the same educational institution, or belong to the same extended family. This network has properties that are rare in observed social networks, which opens up new applications for network science in the social sciences. To demonstrate the applications of such a network, we use a random walk approach to estimate segregation of individuals from differing educational backgrounds and whether specific types of relationships increase or decrease this segregation. The results suggest that relationships between people in the same household greatly increase segregation whilst work, school and neighborhood networks relationships increase exposure to individuals with different backgrounds. The size of these effects is context dependent. Further applications of a whole population network are also discussed",TRUE,FALSE,Educational Segregation|Netherlands|Networks|Random Walk,2021-04-22T09:51:04.511049,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-22T09:49:53.881876,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/our-services/customised-services-microdata/microdata-conducting-your-own-research,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtb2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtb2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtb2/citation/,7jtb2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtb2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtb2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e2kta/,e2kta,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtb2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607ff3b17f02c0007201f9db/,607ff3b17f02c0007201f9db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtb2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtb2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jtb2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7jtb2/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7jtb2

Terrorist attacks, online media reporting and support for refugees in Germany","We analyze whether the Islamist terror attack on the Christmas market in Berlin in 2016 had an impact on public opinion toward immigration in general and, since the attacker has entered Germany to apply for asylum, toward refugees in particular. An analysis of this natural experiment reveals a negative shift regarding the latter, while no differences are observed for the former. To shed more light on the driver of attitude change, we combine these findings with a quantitative content analysis of online media reporting about refugees before and after the attack. Mass media have long been considered to have an impact on exclusionary attitudes toward ethnic minorities. However, empirical evidence on this relationship remains largely anecdotal. We draw upon unsupervised machine learning to quantify the developments in reporting in three popular German online news websites. Results reveal that the attack had significant impact on media reporting on these websites. However, the strong focus on the attack was only short lived, quickly decreasing already in the second week after the attack. Linking media data to the public opinion data reveals no clear connection between reporting and attitudes. In contrast to theoretical expectations, descriptive evidence even shows that both follow almost opposite trends, since people changed their attitudes only weeks after the attack. We discuss potential explanations of these, at first sight, counterintuitive findings.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|berlin|European Social Survey|germany|natural experiment|refugees|terrorism|text analysis|topic modelling,2021-04-21T20:37:26.058679,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-21T08:08:53.288313,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhzju/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhzju/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhzju/citation/,rhzju,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhzju/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhzju/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y5u84/,y5u84,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhzju/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607fdc8f7f02c0007201a300/,607fdc8f7f02c0007201a300,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhzju/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhzju/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rhzju/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rhzju/,https://doi.org/10.5771/0038-6073-2020-1-2-201,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rhzju
