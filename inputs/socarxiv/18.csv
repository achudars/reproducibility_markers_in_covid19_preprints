The Concentration of Funded Research Topics in the United Kingdom,"The misalignment between societal needs and the priorities of conducted research have spurred calls for more attention to what types of research is actually funded. At the same time, published research exhibits strong path dependency by becoming more focused on well-established and reoccurring topics. The distribution of attention over various topics reflect the broader political economy and power structures in science, but whether path dependency starts already at the funding stage is largely unknown. In this article, I ask how skewed and path dependent the distribution of research funding is with respect to research topics. Using data on public funding of more than 30,000 research projects in the United Kingdom since 2006, I show that competitive public research funding is consistently concentrated on a minority of topics. These privileged topics continue to attract the majority of funding over time, and generally stay within the top parts of the funding distribution. Funding of research topics thus seems to follow a process of cumulative advantage, but while higher prior funding levels predicts higher subsequent funding, there is a decreasing marginal return.",TRUE,FALSE,cumulative advantage|funding concentration|research funding,2021-05-04T18:11:40.355794,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-04T07:35:38.259952,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxqr7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxqr7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxqr7/citation/,fxqr7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxqr7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxqr7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxqr7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/608ffa966801ab02af2a34a6/,608ffa966801ab02af2a34a6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxqr7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxqr7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxqr7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fxqr7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fxqr7

However, the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have also had a major impact on social services. The pandemic increased service needs among those who were already adult social work clients before the pandemic; it also created needs among new groups of clients, while the operating environment for service provision changed dramatically. 
In our study we 1) analyse the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult social work clients in Finland, 2) examine the old and new practices in adult social work that were used and developed during the outbreak of the pandemic and 3) assess how well social services were able to respond to clients’ needs during the pandemic. For the analysis we use national survey data obtained from social workers in the Social Barometer survey collected in May 2020 (n=496) and in January 2021 (n=412).
The findings show that social work in Finland succeeded in responding to rather clear and concrete problems such as difficulties in applying for social benefits and lack of housing while more complicated problems, such as unmanageable debts, loneliness and mental health problems were not adequately responded to.

Yet only recently has the distribution of land ownership norms across cultures been examined from evolutionary and ecological perspectives. Here we incorporate evolutionary and macroecological modelling to test associations between land ownership norms and environmental, subsistence, and cultural contact predictors for societies in the Bantu language family. We find that Bantu land ownership norms likely evolved on a unilinear trajectory, but not necessarily one requiring consistent increase in exclusivity as suggested by prior theory. Our macroecological analyses suggest that Bantu societies are more likely to have some form of ownership when their neighbors also do. We also find an effect of environmental productivity, supporting resource defensibility theory, which posits that land ownership is more likely where productivity is predictable. We find less support for a proposed link between agricultural intensification and land ownership.

Accounting for interdependence among ties while studying tie formation is one of the key challenges in this area of research. We address this challenge using an equilibrium framework where firms' decisions to form links with other firms are modeled as a strategic game. In this game, firms weigh the costs and benefits of establishing a relationship with other firms and form ties if their net payoffs are positive. We characterize the equilibrium networks as exponential random graphs (ERGM), and we estimate the firms' payoffs using a Bayesian approach. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we apply the framework to a co-investment network of venture capital firms in the medical device industry. The equilibrium framework allows researchers to draw economic interpretation from parameter estimates of the ERGM Model.  We learn that firms rely on their joint partners (transitivity) and prefer to form ties with firms similar to themselves (homophily). These results hold after controlling for the interdependence among ties. Another, critical advantage of a structural approach is that it allows us to simulate the effects of economic shocks or policy counterfactuals. We test two such policy shocks, namely, firm entry and regulatory change. We show how new firms' entry or a regulatory shock of minimum capital requirements increase the co-investment network's density and clustering.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-05-06T03:14:24.510578,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-05T23:11:18.181531,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysbmq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysbmq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysbmq/citation/,ysbmq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysbmq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysbmq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysbmq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/608e9c085533b401fde2374d/,608e9c085533b401fde2374d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysbmq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysbmq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysbmq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ysbmq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ysbmq

So in order to adequately exploit the capabilities of machines in science, the  FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for scientific data management and stewardship have been proposed. These principles are to assist scientists in tweaking their established research routines so as to unlock the true potential of machines and contribute to better science. 
However, through interviews with key scientist groups implicated by FAIR we have learned that doing what FAIR demands also presents certain epistemic concerns that discourage scientists to trust FAIR.  One such concern is the loss of valuable knowledge in the translation of versatile human readable research output to a restricted, machine friendly language to enable machine action (semantic freedom). A second concern is evident in the displacement of human expertise by this increasing reliance on machines and the ensuing loss of knowledge contributed by these displaced experts (expert intuition). 
Thus, through this article, we highlight how incorporating FAIR also presents an epistemic loss to the scientific community. But the lack of attention given to these concerns by the proponents of FAIR offers scientists who have to abide by FAIR sufficient reason to resist it. We thus propose that while the implementation of FAIR has so far been paternalistic and top-down, such concerns have also made the scientist sceptical. So by initiating a more balanced, open and honest discussion of not just the benefits and promises of FAIR but also such epistemic costs, FAIR could lay to rest reasons for such scepticism and foster trust within the stakeholders of FAIR.",TRUE,FALSE,Data management|Digitalisation|Digitalisation; Data management standards; Machine actionability; Epistemic loss; Trust|Epistemic loss|FAIR Principles|Machine Actionability|Standards|Trust,2021-05-02T23:53:42.781693,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-02T23:53:22.778662,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4csm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4csm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4csm/citation/,x4csm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4csm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4csm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4csm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/608e8f0319183d01f5550c19/,608e8f0319183d01f5550c19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4csm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4csm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4csm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x4csm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x4csm
