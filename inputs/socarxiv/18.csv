Building on research on political trust as related to regime legitimacy and on the evaluative nature of political trust, we formulate hypotheses about the effect of political trust on democracy and of democracy on political trust, both with regard to overall levels of trust in societies, as well as trust by education and age groups. We test these hypotheses with cross-lagged models applied to country time series of political trust from 26 European countries between 1991 and 2019, and with two democracy indicators, from the Varieties of Democracy and the Democracy Barometer projects. We find evidence of effects of democracy on trust and vice versa, as well as of differences in the effects of democracy on political trust among different education and age groups.

Subsequently, we estimate the impact that a system compliant with circular economy goals would have on the cost of waste management. Our empirical analyses are based on an econometric method. The results suggest that Italy could reduce the use of landfill by 11.5%, resulting in a 13% reduction in mechanical-biological treatment. The waste-to-energy capacity would rise by 4.6% compared to the current situation, while the organic fraction treatment capacity would increase by 8.3%. Besides the positive impact on the environment, the potential annual savings on the cost of waste management could reach 0.07%, or 0.27% when the phase corresponding to treatment and disposal is considered.

Previous research indicates that support expression is shaped by gender, but we do not know much about how support within marriage is provided in response to a spouse’s distress outside of a different-sex couple context. In this study, we analyze dyadic data from 378 midlife married couples (35-65 years; N = 756 individuals) within the U.S. to examine how men and women in same- and different-sex relationships provide support when they perceive that their spouse is experiencing distress. We find women in different-sex couples are less likely to report taking care of their distressed spouse’s tasks or giving their distressed spouse more personal time and space compared to women in same-sex couples and men. We also find that men in different-sex couples are less likely to report encouraging their spouse to talk compared to men in same-sex couples and women. Being personally stressed by a spouse’s distress is positively associated with providing support to that spouse, whereas feeling that a spouse’s distress is stressful for the marriage is negatively associated with providing support. This study advances understanding of gendered provisions of support in response to psychological distress in marriage, moving beyond a framing of women as fundamentally more supportive than men to a consideration of how these dynamics may be different or similar in same- and different-sex marital contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,distress|dyadic data|gender|gender differences|marriage|same-sex relationships|stress|support,2021-02-09T15:47:43.654645,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-09T15:41:48.492404,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR37404.v1,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be82v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be82v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be82v/citation/,be82v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be82v/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be82v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be82v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6021e4ccd6a4320020f12ffc/,6021e4ccd6a4320020f12ffc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be82v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be82v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be82v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/be82v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/be82v,NA

With varying degrees of success, various actions within the realm of science diplomacy have accompanied the creation of knowledge related to COVID-19 through international collaboration. The COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a standstill and also drew attention to the genuine need for science diplomacy. This pandemic highlighted the need of training opportunities in the interface of policy and diplomacy for researchers to be able to get grips on emerging health issues. Moreover, it is necessary to create specific platforms for experts to interact with decision-makers at the national and international levels, especially in the Global South. This crisis inevitably shifted the focus on scientific areas that directly address the pandemic response (epidemiology, public health, virology, immunology, pharmacology, human behavioral research, economics, among others). At the same time, some areas not related to the pandemic response have been slowed down due to inevitable physical and social restrictions that impacted certain aspects of the academic life. This does not only relate to daily access to the lab, scientific collections, or field sites, but also associates with furloughed employees and reduced funding to non-COVID-19-related research. Moreover, during the pandemic, women and (usually young) scientists with children have reduced their research efforts substantially, with future implications still difficult to quantify. While some researchers might have harnessed telecommuting and lockdown periods to focus on data analysis and publication writing, gender bias still exists. The slight increase in publications with pre-acquired data may still be followed by an immediate future impacted by the lack of data acquisition during the pandemic. These issues may create long-term effects due to reduced capacity for generating pre-requisite data for securing new funding, termination of research, reduced networking opportunities, restrictions to international collaborations, collectively having a negative impact on other disciplines. While most established researchers may not be affected hardly by the above-mentioned effects, early career researchers (ECRs), represent a more vulnerable population. ECRs usually refer to PhD students, postdoctoral fellows and scientists who have 10 years or less of experience after the doctoral degree, although there is some flexibility in this definition. Due to their career stage, ECRs often face job precarity, lack of available opportunities, low funding, and job insecurity (e.g., untenured positions and temporary contract employees). These problems are augmented by the COVID-19 pandemic and may be experienced more in countries with a developing scientific system. The impact could be higher for countries that are developing their research environment, are dependent on training their ECRs and conducting experiments abroad through international exchanges programs, which have been stopped due to the pandemic. 
Given these unprecedented times, it has been observed that international scientific organizations, policy-makers, scientific communities, and private stakeholders have strengthened their collaborations in response to the pandemic. We, as ECRs, strongly believe that science diplomacy can make a difference in addressing the challenges (emanated or amplified by the current pandemic) that ECRs would face inside and outside academia. Here we present such challenges, and discuss how the Global Young Academy (GYA), an independent organization of early to mid-career researchers across all disciplines and countries, has provided a platform for ECRs to practice science diplomacy, science advice, and science communication. The former by serving as a bridge between ECRs and governments, the second by hearing the voices of young researchers when enacting policies, and the latter by informing societies about the benefits of scientific research. Motivated by the described examples, we recommend measures for scientists, funding agencies, and international organizations to foster international collaboration in these unparallel times.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Early career researchers|Science Diplomacy|Science Policy,2021-02-10T19:52:02.242180,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-10T18:31:17.881970,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/citation/,f9tsw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hfmwr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/relationships/node/,hfmwr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6021a38923238300189d68c6/,6021a38923238300189d68c6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f9tsw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f9tsw,NA

In this contribution, we explored the use of digital data to investigate the online market for songbirds in Indonesia, where keeping pet songbirds is a deeply rooted cultural practice. We examined the spatial characteristics of three dimensions of the songbird trade using data from online sources: birdwatchers’ sightings as a proxy for the supply of the songbird market, small ads from an online marketplace platform, representing the trade itself and its transactions, and videos by pet songbird owners to represent the demand side of the songbird market. We found that, geographically, these three stages of the songbird supply chain did not overlap, which potentially hints at the roles extended transport networks and commercial captive breeding play for the songbird trade. The trade was not confined to major cities but spread out through the country, indicating both a possible democratisation of the trade (i.e. a larger group of sellers, and consumers selling to consumers) and an opportunity to observe previously covert parts of the trade. We further found that the asking prices on online marketplaces were significantly higher than the prices stated in an independently carried out consumer survey, and discuss possible reasons. Data from digital sources can give rich insights into the spatial, temporal and taxonomic structure of wildlife trade, can help understand the motivations of buyers and sellers, and can help direct wildlife trade towards a more sustainable fashion. Our methodology toolbox that allows automatic and continuous monitoring of online marketplaces and includes data preparation and cleaning, and follows the highest standards of data privacy principles, is openly available.",TRUE,FALSE,conservation culturomics|conservation geography|data science|digital conservation|GIS|online data|online marketplaces|pet trade|social media|spatial science|wildlife trade,2021-02-09T15:41:42.778896,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-09T15:37:13.542372,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:att:3e4b2f79-e073-4e64-8f0d-0a173ad4ee9b,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxkgq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxkgq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxkgq/citation/,mxkgq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxkgq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mkdc7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxkgq/relationships/node/,mkdc7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxkgq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602102181d985e0102747e5c/,602102181d985e0102747e5c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxkgq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxkgq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxkgq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mxkgq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mxkgq,NA

Objective: To document and analyse such knowledge, outline how it changed understanding of COVID-19, and specify ethical and socio-political challenges associated with its development.
Methods: Analysis of publicly available materials on Long Covid by people with Long Covid, largely in English and Italian, and across media and genre.  
Results: Those with Long Covid have made epistemic contributions across multiple media, including: oral, written and visual narratives, testimonies and arguments; quantitative and qualitative research; grey literature, essays, opinion pieces and commentaries; and advocacy and policy interventions. 
Discussion: Patient knowledge contributed to shifting assumptions concerning COVID-19 symptoms and disease pathways; phasing and duration; classification and naming of illness; disease morbidity; and who is affected. Patients’ use of a wide range of media challenged the conventional scientific production of epistemic claims. Many ethical and political challenges lie ahead, including exploitation of patients, their knowledge, and their data.
Conclusions: Long Covid patient activism and research have been instrumental to key epistemic shifts that have changed understandings of COVID-19. They have also changed – possibly permanently – how science and medical knowledge are produced. Patient expertise must be routinely integrated into medicine beyond the current pandemic. We also need to ensure the ethical use of patient-led expertise and patient-produced data in Long Covid.
