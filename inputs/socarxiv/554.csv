We analyze the response of international financial markets to the 2016 US presidential election. The surprise election outcome represents an exogenous shock that affords us a unique opportunity to estimate the effect of a partisan shift in the White House on third countries. Given Donald Trump's unanticipated victory and his promises of financial deregulation, investors revised their return expectations for third countries according to countries' exposure to the election shock. We argue that countries with dense financial ties to the US benefited from expectations of regulatory reform in Wall Street. We estimate the election effect on foreign equity markets using data on 134 single-country exchange-traded funds (ETFs) covering 48 developed and developing economies. Results show that the election had an overall negative effect on international markets, but countries with close ties to the US banking system fared better.

Social networks have many distinctive characteristics that demarcate them from SMS (Short Message Service), VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) and the ordinary voice phone call.
Early social networks prior to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Linkedin included MySpace and Xanga. MySpace which was founded in 2003 was early adaptor to the fundamental concepts we know today like networking, personal framing online and sharing that undermine every social interaction offline and online. Xanga pioneered the highly customizable profile which gave users the option to customize practically any element on their page by accessing the HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) code of the visual elements they could modify to their own liking and personality, this however required a lot of programming skills and was a set back for the social network’s aim of customizability.
In our current state and time in the western world in academic, work and extracurricular activities nearly all of the members interacting are on one social network, if not all that are mentioned. Facebook serves as a social marketing tool for some of its users that frame their lives in a pseudo-happy frame and some let out their problems and grasp Facebook as a personal journal without the confidentiality of a paperback journal. Instagram is visually based social network that aims to extrovert one’s creative skills of being a smartphone photographer. Instagram includes tools that help your photography skills and even provide a toolbox of premade filters set to provide digitally taken photographs with an old-school visual of film photography. Linkedin lets business workers, owners, seekers and entrepreneurs connect to one another in a highly formal manner, something that isn’t found in Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.
This research takes the social network Twitter as its content matter due to its significant uniqueness of not being a visually based social network that is prevalent today. Twitter has been known for its straight message transmissions from the sender to the receiver. On Twitter everyone can interact with everyone from celebrities and politicians to farmers and students. This research aims to answer the concept of correlations and trends between Twitter users and their social network scope. Being branded as the “social network for smarter people”, Twitter is relevant to the intellectual property that composes the electronic knowledge base. Twitter is a witty and smart social network; users have 140 characters or less to compose their message.

Scholars from various disciplinary perspectives have put forth theories of why homeland states engage with emigrant or coethnic populations, and why these populations seek to engage with the government of their homeland. What is missing in the literature is a theory of how such homeland-diaspora relationships come into being and how they change over time. Understanding the development of homeland-diaspora relationships is crucial for making sense of migrant transnationalism and of state sovereignty in a globalized era.  

This study addresses this gap in the literature through a historical and ethnographic study of the relationship between the Republic of China (ROC) and Chinese language schools in Los Angeles. The case of the ROC and the Chinese diaspora is an illuminating case because the anomalous nature of the ROC’s political status calls into question many of the main assumptions in the existing literature. In particular, it challenges the assumption that each diaspora corresponds to a sole, legitimated homeland state. 

In the Chinese case, the geopolitical divisions at the end of the Chinese Civil War resulted in two states: the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on the Chinese mainland and the ROC on the island of Taiwan. While the communist PRC was not geopolitically legitimate in the West during the early part of the Cold War, widespread recognition of the PRC in the 1970s has left the ROC’s statehood claim in a liminal state. For the diaspora, this has resulted in two potential homeland states. 

The ROC’s de-legitimated claim to statehood has left it dependent on diaspora political support just as demographic shifts and transformations in the US social and political environment made it easier for the diaspora to support the PRC. I argue that the balance of power between the ROC diaspora bureau and the language schools have transformed since the Cold War as a result of domestic and geopolitical changes. The key factor shaping this relationship is the presence of the PRC and its changing geopolitical role since the 1980s. My explanation bridges theories of migrant transnationalism with theories of resource dependence among hierarchically linked organizations.

ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'18), April 21–26, Montreal, Canada. doi: 10.1145/3173574.3173951

Data-driven decision-making consequential to individuals raises important questions of accountability and justice. Indeed, European law provides individuals limited rights to 'meaningful information about the logic' behind significant, autonomous decisions such as loan approvals, insurance quotes, and CV filtering. We undertake three experimental studies examining people's perceptions of justice in algorithmic decision-making under different scenarios and explanation styles. Dimensions of justice previously observed in response to human decision-making appear similarly engaged in response to algorithmic decisions. Qualitative analysis identified several concerns and heuristics involved in justice perceptions including arbitrariness, generalisation, and (in)dignity. Quantitative analysis indicates that explanation styles primarily matter to justice perceptions only when subjects are exposed to multiple different styles---under repeated exposure of one style, scenario effects obscure any explanation effects. Our results suggests there may be no 'best' approach to explaining algorithmic decisions, and that reflection on their automated nature both implicates and mitigates justice dimensions.",TRUE,FALSE,algorithmic accountability|algorithmic transparency|article 22|automated decision-making|credit scoring|explanation facilities|gdpr|procedural justice|right to an explanation|right to explanation,2018-07-02T11:37:25.762784,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-31T14:01:42.517204,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,ACM,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/citation/,9wqxr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xn75d/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/relationships/node/,xn75d,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a71a9ee9cd73200120a1055/,5a71a9ee9cd73200120a1055,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9wqxr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9wqxr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9wqxr,https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173951

Abstract: in the current investigation work, we will analyse the right to the energy supply, as a leading good to other improvements in decent housing, education, health, etc. We will also observe how is the impact of the supply in the different aspects of daily life in the communities and specially in their women. The case study will be developed into the frame of the international development cooperation, taking several projects of rural electrification in the South coordinated by develompent NGOs from the North. The analysis will make a panoramic and historical revision of the evolution of the international develompent cooperation and the different approaches from a gender perspective. Later on we will deepen the concept of Energy and the evolution of its consumption along the Human History, being specially aware of not skipping the fact that the use of women bodies as an energy resource is essential to mantain the current economical system. We are in the need of a different paradigma that questions the basis of Capitalism and Patriarchy, because here is where the hegemonic concepts are hold. Thus, we will propose an analysis framework with an Ecofeminist approach to obtain sustainability and we will use it to analyse the projects of rural electrification.

The critical Human Rights theory defines the rights as fighting processes that pursue an egalitarian access to material and immaterial goods. Taking this into account, the energy supply is understood as a material good that will lead to the obtention of other material and immaterial goods. Thus, the technology implemented in the communities for the energy supply will go together with a fighting process to get an egalitarian access, along with processes of social transformation. So, the technology installed must mean a real emancipation tool for the community and especially for women. This emancipation will depend on the process rather than on the transference as a simple  technological aim. This is why the development NGOs that work for the defense of the rights in this communities suppling them energy must go beyond a simpe technified approach. That means the need of focusing in the process, letting the community participate and reviewing the models of participation from a gender perspective. The goal must then be the satisfaction of the basic needs of the population and especially the real needs of women, because they have been hidden under gender roles. Besides, the implementation of technology cannot forget aspects as environmental, social and gender justice for the effective and real achievement of the desired sustainability.",TRUE,FALSE,cooperación internacional|decrecimiento|derechos humanos|desarrollo|ecofeminismos|ecología política|economía ecológica|Economía feminista|electrificación rural|género y energía,2018-07-02T11:37:22.653794,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-01-29T20:42:55.593789,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/citation/,czvs8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/g2vur/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/relationships/node/,g2vur,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a6f202a2c4f20000ed02e0c/,5a6f202a2c4f20000ed02e0c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czvs8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/czvs8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/czvs8,NA

In examining the potential of super-diversity as a methodological lens, I identify a risk of downplaying the effect of “old” categories of difference that are likely to continue to shape social structures as well as space. I propose a re-centering of power and inequality in the study of super-diversity by situating its study within an urban culturalist approach, with sociological tools borrowed from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism. This proposal is illustrated through the analysis of two public spaces in a super-diverse New York neighborhood.
