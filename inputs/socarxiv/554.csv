It is produced by three processes, none of which are meritocratic: (1) talent is unequally distributed by the rigged lottery of birth, (2) talent is defined in ways that favor some traits over others, and (3) the market for talent is manipulated to maximally extract advantages by those who have more of it. To see how, we require a sociological perspective on economic rent. I argue that talent is a major means through which people seek rent in modern-day capitalism. Talent today is what inherited land was to feudal societies; an unchallenged source of symbolic and economic rewards. Whereas God sanctified the aristocracy’s wealth, contemporary privilege is legitimated by meritocracy. Drawing on the work of Gary Becker, Pierre Bourdieu and Jerome Karabel, I show how rent-seeking in modern societies has come to rely principally on rent definition and creation. Inequality is produced by the ways in which talent is defined, institutionalization, and sustained by the moral deservingness we attribute to the accomplishments of talents. Consequently, today’s inequalities are as striking as ever, yet harder to challenge than ever before.",TRUE,FALSE,inequality|merit|rent|talent,2018-08-20T23:53:42.997781,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-20T23:53:27.888541,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9vh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9vh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9vh/citation/,ky9vh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9vh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/786uv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9vh/relationships/node/,786uv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9vh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b7b0890d4676c001aab843e/,5b7b0890d4676c001aab843e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9vh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9vh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ky9vh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ky9vh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ky9vh,NA

Results indicated that depression and masculinity had independent effects on father involvement.

try to establish regularities, over space and time, in the complex
system that is the human phenomenon. Although vocabulary and tools
have changed, the questions that animate this research program bear
striking similarity to those pursued by nineteenth-century
intellectuals in a quest to establish universal laws shaping human
affairs. In fact, that very quest provided the impetus for the
emergence of what would later become distinct disciplines in the
social and historical sciences, including anthropology and sociology.

Why, then, is this interdisciplinary research program often met with
skepticism, or even outright resistance, within anthropology?

In this chapter I provide a brief outline of developments in the
history of anthropology leading to this state of affairs, in the hope
of alleviating misunderstanding between those who support the
interdisciplinary research program and those who oppose it. As a
practical contribution toward this end, I then provide an overview of
key established resources for systematic comparative approaches to the
archaeological record. I conclude by discussing challenges and
opportunities in this area at the interface with recent developments

Thus, risk for genetic disease represents a collective stressor shared by family members. According to communal coping theory, families may adapt to such risk vis-a-vis interpersonal exchange of support resources. We propose that communal coping is operationalized through the pattern of supportive relationships observed between family members. While past research has examined support exchange of family members who received genetic testing, the roles of family members who declined testing, or were not otherwise at risk for disease, have not been fully examined. In this study, we take a social network perspective to map communal coping mechanisms to their underlying social interactions and include those who declined testing or were not at risk for Lynch Syndrome. Specifically, we examine the exchange of emotional support resources in families at risk of Lynch Syndrome, a dominantly inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome. Our results show that emotional support resources depend on the testing-status of individual family members and are not limited to the bounds of the family.  Network members from within and outside the family system are an important coping resource in this patient population. This work illustrates how social network approaches can be used to test structural hypotheses related to communal coping within a broader system and identifies structural features that characterize coping processes in families affected by Lynch Syndrome.",TRUE,FALSE,block-diagonal|communal coping|ergm|genetic testing|lynch syndrome|social networks,2018-08-17T11:59:03.805854,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-17T11:58:12.487662,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be9vd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be9vd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be9vd/citation/,be9vd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be9vd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/56fhp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be9vd/relationships/node/,56fhp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be9vd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b759931877d61001cbbb0e6/,5b759931877d61001cbbb0e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be9vd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be9vd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/be9vd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/be9vd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/be9vd,NA

I distinguish between state theories, process theories, and object theories of institutions and institutionalization, arguing that while process accounts are an improvement over state approaches, they cannot provide a self-sufficient framework without theorizing the objects that the processes are supposed to be applied to. To achieve this goal, I build on an analytic disaggregation of the culture concept to specify the possible set of “things” that can be said to be institutionalized. I argue for an analytic distinction between “doings” (practices, habits, routines), “sayings” (vocabularies), semiotic codes, rules of the game, and artifacts as the broad classes of objects that could be subject to institutionalization processes and can thus form the “building blocks” of institutions. I conclude that process accounts need to be decoupled from object accounts, because the same processes may apply to all of these objects via distinct mechanisms, while other proposed processes only apply to a restricted set of objects.",TRUE,FALSE,Artifacts|Codes|Culture|Institutions|Practices|Vocabularies,2018-08-17T11:54:04.586294,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-17T11:53:45.230986,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Omar Lizardo,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eu34/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eu34/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eu34/citation/,2eu34,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eu34/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zweac/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eu34/relationships/node/,zweac,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eu34/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b759497877d61001bbbaf65/,5b759497877d61001bbbaf65,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eu34/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eu34/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eu34/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2eu34/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2eu34,NA

One school of thought argues for a complete upending of past patterns with nation-states in their hierarchical alignment as the center core and periphery of power in this system. An alternative view instead argues that the regularized interaction that characterizes a world system may envisage a number of modes of production without altering its fundamental structure). The world system in this view is made up of a variety of complex intraorganizational and interorganizational networks intersecting with geographical networks structured particularly around linked clusters of socioeconomic activity. Information and carrier technologies based on new forms of information technologies and their connection to network technologies play a vital role in the long-term evolution of world system development characterized by both path-dependencies and major transformations that result from technological innovations. While digital information technologies significantly alter the processing and use of information as a central element of power and control within this network structure and therefore its network logic, they do not break the evolutionary process of world system development.",TRUE,FALSE,ary models|complexity|development|digital capitalism|digitalization|evolution|hierarchy|information and communication technology (ICT)|information processing|innovation|IPE|networks|path-dependence|sovereign states|systems theory|technology|world system,2018-08-17T11:52:01.328081,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-17T11:51:32.457179,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxjvt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxjvt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxjvt/citation/,mxjvt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxjvt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vg635/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxjvt/relationships/node/,vg635,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxjvt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b756d890a133c00170cca62/,5b756d890a133c00170cca62,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxjvt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxjvt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mxjvt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mxjvt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mxjvt,NA

It provides a bridge between existing and divergent but related strings of research of particular systemic elements as a unifying macro-theory of our social and physical world, fusing multiple approaches into a common model. The unifying key is the focus on the behavior of agents (e.g., individuals; groups; cities; states; world systems) as it relates to the environment (both natural and social) in which these agents act and the feedback between behavior and environment. Evolutionary systems approaches can broadly be placed into two categories: (1) the biobehavioral and (2) the socialevolutionary approach to the study of international relations with the help of evolutionary theory. The point of evolutionary explanations is not to make the case that humans are incapable of making their own choices —far from it, learning and selection are critical elements of human agency in evolutionary models. Rather, evolutionary systems theory also includes in its models the structural capacity to make those choices, which derives from and depends on previous choices made, a process that is also bound by our biological evolution or alternatively by our cognitive limitations and available selection mechanisms, regardless of the relative complexity of human learning capacity.",TRUE,FALSE,networks,2018-08-16T15:32:21.753481,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-08-16T15:32:06.256865,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9axt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9axt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9axt/citation/,b9axt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9axt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7264d/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9axt/relationships/node/,7264d,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9axt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b75685115f5c500170b7ee5/,5b75685115f5c500170b7ee5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9axt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9axt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9axt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b9axt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b9axt,NA
