Scholars debate whether this inequality stems from racial differences in human capital (e.g. college selectivity, GPA, college major) or employer discrimination against black job candidates.  However, limited measures of human capital and the inherent difficulties in measuring discrimination using observational data make determining the cause of racial differences in labor market outcomes a difficult endeavor.  In this research, I examine employment opportunities for white and black graduates of elite top-ranked universities versus high-ranked but less selective institutions.  Using an audit design, I create matched candidate pairs and apply for 1,008 jobs on a national job search website.  I also exploit existing birth record data in selecting names to control for differences across social class within racialized names.  The results show that although a credential from an elite university results in more employer responses for all candidates, black candidates from elite universities only do as well as white candidates from less selective universities.  Moreover, race results in a double penalty: when employers respond to black candidates it is for jobs with lower starting salaries and lower prestige than those of white peers.  These racial differences suggest that a bachelor’s degree, even one from an elite institution, cannot fully counteract the importance of race in the labor market.  Thus, both discrimination and differences in human capital contribute to racial economic inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,credentials|discrimination|education|employment|inequality|labor markets|race,2018-07-02T11:48:48.029429,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-23T13:36:56.972603,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qjue/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qjue/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qjue/citation/,6qjue,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qjue/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/neu3g/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qjue/relationships/node/,neu3g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qjue/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5add01e0b855b8000cfd7c69/,5add01e0b855b8000cfd7c69,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qjue/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qjue/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6qjue/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6qjue/,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/sou111,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6qjue

To address the question in an effective manner the type of leader being addressed is narrowed to exclude outliers such as extremely good, bad, or ineffective leaders. The types of decisions that they face is also narrowed to abstract external factors. Hobfoll's Conservation of Resources (COR) theory is then used as a framework to explain why a leader would abrogate or transfer their decision making. From this analysis which applies depletion of resources specifically to the case of the leader, I propose that there is a primary and secondary decision process, which incurs additional depletion for the case of the leader. The conclusion is that leaders who are otherwise competent and effective are liable to be depleted in their resources, which then would incur a higher cost in resources to resolve at the very moment when they are depleted of resources.",TRUE,FALSE,Conservation of Resesources|COR|Decision abrogation|depletion|leader|leadership,2018-07-02T11:48:47.979466,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-22T21:38:50.009458,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/citation/,xp5gn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4x2pg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/relationships/node/,4x2pg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5adce5c1b855b8000efd3f9b/,5adce5c1b855b8000efd3f9b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xp5gn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xp5gn/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xp5gn

After balancing selection factors that influence premarital cohabitation through propensity score matching, the author uses Cox proportional hazards models to examine the selection, causation, and diffusion perspectives on the relationship between premarital cohabitation and marital dissolution. The results show that premarital cohabitation is positively associated with divorce for those married in the early‐reform period (1980–1994) when cohabitation was uncommon. However, this relationship disappears for those married in the late‐reform period (1995–2010) when cohabitation became more prevalent. The findings suggest variation in the link between premarital cohabitation and divorce across different marriage cohorts and provide strong evidence for the diffusion perspective in postreform China.

This paper highlights some of the philosophical and sociological dimensions that have been found empirically in work conducted with robot scientists - that is, with autonomous robotic systems for scientific discovery. Robot scientists do not supply definite answers to the discussed questions, but rather provide ""proofs of concept"" for various ideas. For example, it is not that robot scientists solve the realist/antirealist philosophical debate, but that when working with robot scientists one has to make a philosophical choice - in this case, to assume a realist view of science. There are still few systems for autonomous scientific discovery in existence, and it is too early to generalize and propose new theories. However, being ""in the midst of ... a revolution"" it is important for the research community to re-examine views pertinent to scientific discovery.

To address this question, we revise empirical models examining environmental activism by disaggregating the outcome variable of movement participation and dichotomizing two key motivational factors. Using repeated cross-sectional data from the US General Social Survey of 2000 and 2010, this study conducts logistic regression of four forms of participation on perceived severity and sense of efficacy, while accounting for biographical availability and political engagement. Results from regression analysis show that vocabularies of motive have substantial impacts on an individual’s likelihood of: 1) signing a petition; 2) giving money; 3) joining a group; and 4) joining a protest or demonstration. Their effects are large enough to override the noticeable impacts of liberalism and education. This study also finds that the level of participation in the movement across all forms has decreased between 2000 and 2010.  These findings direct our attention to the limited capacity of the public sphere to accommodate the environmental movement during the last decade, as well as to potential changes in environmental activism in the coming decades that may mobilize those previously less likely to participate.",TRUE,FALSE,education|environmental movement|liberalism|movement participation|vocabularies of motive,2018-07-02T11:48:45.896170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-20T15:46:38.027817,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/citation/,hetzb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/96xdp/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/relationships/node/,96xdp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ad9f6bd144be4001179bb15/,5ad9f6bd144be4001179bb15,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hetzb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hetzb/,https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2017.1331121,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hetzb

Scholars are beginning to develop models to explain LGBT inclusion in schools, but they have undertheorized the role of religion in facilitating or impeding LGBT inclusion. In this article, I draw from the literature on religion and the “culture wars,” especially insights into religions’ theological orientations, to explain Christian colleges and universities’ inclusion of LGBT students. I show that communal orientations—theological emphases on social justice—strongly predict the adoption of LGBT groups and inclusive nondiscrimination policies at Christian colleges and universities. By contrast, individualist orientations—theological emphases on personal piety—impede the adoption of such groups and policies. Importantly, I find little support for alternative explanations of Christian colleges and universities’ inclusion of LGBT students that focus on liberal or conservative teachings on same-sex relationships. Beyond bridging literatures on the political sociology of LGBT rights and religion and the culture wars, the article supports an emerging theoretical framework for understanding the role of religion in a wide range of social justice debates.",TRUE,FALSE,culture wars|education|LGBT rights|religion|sexualities|social movements|sociology,2018-07-02T11:48:45.848549,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-20T15:46:13.714268,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jw8am/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jw8am/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jw8am/citation/,jw8am,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jw8am/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gzcb6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jw8am/relationships/node/,gzcb6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jw8am/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ad9f37db855b8000cfb7d7f/,5ad9f37db855b8000cfb7d7f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jw8am/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jw8am/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jw8am/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jw8am/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2329496516651639,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jw8am

It does this through a case study of the career of the metaphor of weaponization that became ubiquitous around the United States’ 2016 presidential election. As a concept, the word originated in the Cold War defense industry as a literal description of the logistical deployment of weapons systems. As its use mutated into a metaphor between 1999-2003, it took on its contemporary moral meaning of over-politicizing things that had been, and should remain, neutral or peaceful. By 2017 “the weaponization of everything” implied that all aspects of social life were newly embroiled in illegitimate politics, making the metaphor a profound act of nostalgia that erased even recent conflicts. Weaponization demonstrates that a metaphor can retain its meaningfulness when it becomes ubiquitous by marshalling a temporal narrative tension against widely shared perceptions of recent social change. This is surprising because contemporary metaphor theory implies that ubiquitous metaphors become mere descriptions or concepts if they are not used in different ways that are embedded in competing discursive communities. Because metaphors derive their meaningfulness through tension, weaponiz- shows how temporality, or social time, can be marshalled to attempt to create a shared public that understands itself as deeply divided. Weaponization is thus instructive as an act of folk sociology that exposes as social and conflicted, things that were previously natural or innocuous. Weaponization indicates a yearning for a shared polity in divided times, and shows that political metaphors can create broad publics that share the same meaning for all sides among competing political groups, even if that meaning is a naïve or utopian rejection of politics altogether.",TRUE,FALSE,2016 presidential election|conceptual metaphor theory|cultural anxiety|cultural politics|metaphor|New York Times|social time|temporality|weaponization,2018-07-02T11:48:43.359055,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-04-19T15:43:54.335419,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/citation/,sur6e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5efrw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/relationships/node/,5efrw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ad86121694cf90011f2e8d3/,5ad86121694cf90011f2e8d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sur6e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sur6e/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sur6e
