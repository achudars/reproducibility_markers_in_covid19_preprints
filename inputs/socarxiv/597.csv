It is less well understood how Cameralism as a policy of order and development and monetary theory went together. The present paper will attempt a sketch of these working mechanisms as well as provide a few angles for new perspectives and future research. A first section after the brief introduction studies general issues of development in relation to balance of payment constraints (II), followed by the discourses on whether the domestic currency ought to remain stable in terms of intrinsic (silver) value (III), or whether it may be debased so as to raise domestic exports and competitiveness (IV). Both options were considered, at times and by varying actors, as valid strategies of promoting economic development, especially export-led growth, although most contemporaries viewed coin debasement as harmful to the economy. A fifth section discusses an alternative to the aforementioned strategies, by raising effective monetary mass through increasing velocity. Since the middle ages and into the nineteenth century the German economic tradition had a clear understanding of how velocity could be managed and the common weal stimulated by an increase in “vivacity” of circulation (V). Upon hindsight it appears that we find here a powerful programme towards promoting economic development and Europe’s rise towards capitalism. A conclusion will offer some thoughts for further research (VI).",TRUE,FALSE,Cameralism|E|Economic History|Economic Theory|Heterodox Economics|Mercantilism,2018-07-02T11:13:33.238659,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-29T09:57:15.826987,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd1|Arts and Humanities|History|Intellectual History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce3|Arts and Humanities|History|European History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dca|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic Theory,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4gms/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4gms/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4gms/citation/,k4gms,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4gms/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zbpga/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4gms/relationships/node/,zbpga,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4gms/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ce18326c613b02958eec75/,59ce18326c613b02958eec75,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4gms/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4gms/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4gms/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k4gms/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k4gms

In order to get a better grip on p-values, we need to make epistemological sense of them. I argue that the least inappropriate way of understanding the relation of p-values to beliefs is  to regard p-values as a degree of epistemic luck, or, in the rare contexts in which the belief in a null model is justified, as a degree of justifiedness. When we handle p-values in an epistemically responsible way, there is no need to abandon them. What should be abandoned, however, is the use of p-values as a default tool in data analysis: Instead of relying on default tools, we should justify our data analysis tools each time we perform some data analytic task.",TRUE,FALSE,bayesian|epistemology|nhst|p-value|statistical significance|statistics,2018-07-02T11:13:30.875327,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-26T11:04:08.022626,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf5|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Epistemology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6jtx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6jtx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6jtx/citation/,g6jtx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6jtx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/v95eb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6jtx/relationships/node/,v95eb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6jtx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ca339f594d900253eab02c/,59ca339f594d900253eab02c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6jtx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6jtx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6jtx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6jtx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6jtx

To identify as many AH&amp;SS journals as possible, a master list of 66,454 journals covered by various databases was developed. All AH&amp;SS journals in that list were searched on GSM. Additionally, a series of keyword searches were carried out to identify journals covered by GSM which weren’t present in the master list. A total of 9,188 AH&amp;SS journals with names written in Latin characters were found in the 2015 edition of GSM (which displays data about articles published between 2010 and 2014). Besides the journal-level indicators provided by GSM (H5-index and H5-median), several additional indicators were computed (H5-citations, H5-index and H5-citations without journal self-citations, and journal self-citation rate). Journals are displayed by subject categories and by country of publication. Quartiles were computed for each category, and journals in a category were further classified either as core (high affinity to the category) or related (partial affinity).

Analogies with rational mechanics played a pivotal role in the search for formal models in economics. In the period between the two world wars, a small group of mathematical economists tried to extend this view from statics to dynamics. The main result was the extensive application of calculus of variations to obtain a dynamic representation of e-conomic variables. This approach began with the contributions put forward by Griffith C.Evans, a mathematician who in the first phase of his scientific career published wi-dely in economics. Evans' research was further developed by his student, Charles Roos. At the international level, this dynamic approach found its main followers in Italy, within the Paretian tradition. During the 1930s, Luigi Amoroso, the leading exponent of the Paretian School, made major contributions along with his student, Giulio La Volpe that anticipated the concept of temporary equilibrium. The analysis of the application of the calculus of variations to economic dynamics in the interwar period raises a set of questions on the application of mathematics designed to study mechanics and physics to economics",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:13:27.849579,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-25T09:04:52.561054,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8abrk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8abrk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8abrk/citation/,8abrk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8abrk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8eacb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8abrk/relationships/node/,8eacb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8abrk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59c8c5629ad5a1025fb4e3ce/,59c8c5629ad5a1025fb4e3ce,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8abrk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8abrk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8abrk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8abrk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8abrk

In this paper we examine attitudes towards violence perpetrated by indigenous activists to claim for rights and violence by pólice officers against indigenous people. We assess the role that perceived pólice legitimacy, procedurally just policing towards the indigenous minority group and group identity play in the justification of intergroup violence.  

Method: We present findings from two surveys (Study 1, n=1493, Study 2, n=198) and an experiment (Study 3, n=76) conducted among indigenous people in Chile. Studies 1 and 2 measure perceptions of police procedural justice towards indigenous people. Study 3 manipulates the fairness with which police officers treat indigenous people. Effects of procedural justice on police legitimacy (Studies 2 and 3) and attitudes towards violence for social change and social control (Studies 1-3) are analyzed. 

Result: Higher perceptions of procedurally just policing towards indigenous people predict more support for police violence and less support for violence perpetrated by indigenous activists. These effects are mediated by perceived police legitimacy and moderated by identification with the minority group. Among people who identify strongly with their indigenous group, perceiving high procedural justice predicts greater police legitimacy, greater support for police violence, and lesser support for violence perpetrated by indigenous activists. 

Conclusions: Findings contribute to an emerging literature on the roles of procedural justice and legitimacy in violence perceptions. Fair, respectful and neutral treatment of pólice officers may reduce the support for violence among minority group members and increase trust in the violence used by police officers.",TRUE,FALSE,Intergroup violence|legitimacy|procedural justice|social identity,2018-07-02T11:13:27.797662,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-25T08:04:44.458289,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz6n5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz6n5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz6n5/citation/,mz6n5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz6n5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rvz32/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz6n5/relationships/node/,rvz32,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz6n5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59c8b6cc594d900250ea1d88/,59c8b6cc594d900250ea1d88,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz6n5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz6n5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mz6n5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mz6n5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mz6n5

More recently, the notion of sustainability -- that is, the efficient use of energy and resources at both the personal and organizational levels -- has been recognized as a contributor to developing competitive advantage. Personal sustainability contributes to organizational sustainability by raising awareness about sustainability at the organizational level, promoting engagement among members of an organization, and ensuring that individuals have the energy and resources to contribute to the overall mission of the organization. For this interplay to occur, though, sustainability must be part of the organization’s core values. In this case study, we examine the culture of the annual Burning Man event in the Black Rock Desert of northwestern Nevada, and examine how personal sustainability impacts the success of the event, while helping to create a strong cultural identity among participants known as “Burners”.",TRUE,FALSE,Burning Man|culture|design|quality|sustainability,2018-07-02T11:13:27.231587,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-24T01:07:27.780916,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,Palgrave Macmillan,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwq7m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwq7m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwq7m/citation/,xwq7m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwq7m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wu57h/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwq7m/relationships/node/,wu57h,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwq7m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59c704de6c613b025ce25361/,59c704de6c613b025ce25361,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwq7m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwq7m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwq7m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xwq7m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xwq7m

I find two underlying dimensions: ""race/identity"" and ""trade-plus."" Attitudes toward Muslim immigration and transgender people emerge as the clearest divides between Trump and Clinton voters. Trade is nearly orthogonal to ""race/identity"" and cleaves both candidates' blocs. Attitudes toward redistributive policies split both parties, depending on the question asked. Supporters of Republican and Democratic candidates reflect distinct positions on ""race/identity"" (except those of Kasich). Sanders supporters are at least as liberal as Clinton supporters on ""race/identity."" They are slightly to the left of all others on ""trade-plus.""
