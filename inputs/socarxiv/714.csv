Crucially, educational technology is now a multi billion dollar business – involving global technology corporations in local educational provision and practice. The need for critical questions to be asked of education and technology is more pressing than ever. This chapter lays out some fundamental questions that need to be voiced in the face of such advances. In particular, it reconsiders seven critical challenges raised by the media critic Neil Postman. While Postman was concerned with the effect of computers and the internet on schools in the 1990s, much of what he argued for could be seen as having continued relevance to our current era of smartphones, big data and cloud computing. The chapter outlines the implications of these lines of critical questioning for making sense of the current state of education and technology. These are discussed in terms of: central topics of concern; key actors and interests; methods of inquiry; and likely outcomes of asking critical questions of education and technology.",TRUE,FALSE,Critical|Digital|Educational technology|Neil Postman,2018-07-02T10:55:49.858695,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-16T06:25:16.374401,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,CC-By,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmyg8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmyg8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmyg8/citation/,rmyg8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmyg8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sy5nx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmyg8/relationships/node/,sy5nx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmyg8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58f30d806c613b024e89e17f/,58f30d806c613b024e89e17f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmyg8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmyg8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rmyg8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rmyg8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rmyg8,NA

On the one hand, wealthy southerners had incentives to free-ride on poorer southerners and avoid fighting; on the other hand, wealthy southerners were disproportionately slaveowners, and thus had more at stake in the outcome of the war. We assemble a dataset on roughly 3.9 million free citizens in the Confederacy, and show that slaveowners were more likely to fight than non-slaveowners. We then exploit a randomized land lottery held in 1832 in Georgia. Households of lottery winners owned more slaves in 1850 and were more likely to have sons who fought in the Confederate Army. We conclude that slaveownership, in contrast to some other kinds of wealth, compelled southerners to fight despite free-rider incentives because it raised their stakes in the war’s outcome.",TRUE,FALSE,civil war|confederacy|conflict|political economy|rebellion,2018-07-02T10:55:49.385969,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-13T17:42:40.716983,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yka5v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yka5v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yka5v/citation/,yka5v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yka5v/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yka5v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yka5v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58efb8079ad5a1025a22e52a/,58efb8079ad5a1025a22e52a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yka5v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yka5v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yka5v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yka5v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yka5v,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055419000170

Despite claims that the subprime mortgage crisis helped fuel recent political turmoil in the U.S., we lack systematic empirical evidence about the effects of this unprecedented spike in home foreclosures on American elections. We combine nationwide deed-level public records data on home foreclosures with election data and administrative voter data to examine the effects of home foreclosures on electoral outcomes and on individual voter turnout.  At the aggregate level, county-level difference-in-differences estimates show that counties that suffered larger increases in foreclosures did not punish or reward members of the incumbent president's party more than less affected counties.  At the individual level, merging the Ohio voter file with foreclosure data, difference-in-differences estimates reveal that Ohioans whose homes were foreclosed on were somewhat less likely to turn out to vote, particularly when foreclosures occurred close to election day.

However, the magnitude of the gender gap varies significantly by country, ranging from 2 to 20 hours per week in this study. Using data from the 2002 International Social Survey Programme, this article investigates whether work-hour regulations have a significant effect on household allocation of paid labour and gender work-hour inequality. Two main types of work-hour regulations are examined: standard weekly work hours and the maximum allowable weekly work hours. Results show that households in countries with shorter maximum weekly work hours had less work-hour inequality between spouses, as each additional allowable overtime hour over the standard workweek increased the work-hour gap between couples by 20 minutes. These results indicate that couples’ inequality in work hours and gender inequality in labour supply are associated with country-level work-hour regulations.",TRUE,FALSE,employment|family policy|gender|work hours,2018-07-02T10:55:48.543294,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-10T15:46:06.164528,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",Liana Christin Landivar,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/citation/,xbwnj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8436p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/relationships/node/,8436p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58eba7fa594d90024f0b4125/,58eba7fa594d90024f0b4125,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbwnj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xbwnj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xbwnj,https://doi.org/10.1177/0950017014568139

An Occupational Assessment of Women’s Employment","After decades of growth, women’s labor force participation stagnated in the 2000s, prompting widespread interest in work-family balance and opting out. However, much of the research and media attention is limited to small samples of women in managerial and professional occupations. Using data from the 2009 American Community Survey, this study examines mothers’ labor force participation and work hours across 92 occupations to assess whether mothers in non-managerial and non-professional occupations exhibit similar work patterns. I find that mothers in managerial and professional occupations are the least likely to remain out of the labor force but most likely to work reduced hours. The results indicate that there is significant occupational variation in women’s work-family strategies, and these comparisons provide insight into the differential structures of disadvantage that encourage different work-family outcomes.",TRUE,FALSE,gender|mothers|occupations|opting out|women's employment|work|work hours,2018-07-02T10:55:48.513184,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-10T15:27:12.022927,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",Liana Christin Landivar,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/citation/,sx7wm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/27m3f/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/relationships/node/,27m3f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58eba2e0b83f690250b8b5b5/,58eba2e0b83f690250b8b5b5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sx7wm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sx7wm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sx7wm,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12075

The Communicative Approach promised rapid results in English language learning, however concerns have been voiced on a perceived decline in students’ performance in writing proficiency, following the shift in focus to communication (Lakhwe, 2016; Maalouf,2016). Thirty years after its implementation, calls were made to reevaluate the Communicative Approach based on case studies and results from ELL contexts (Bacha, 2016; Samra, 2016). Arguments provided that what may work in native contexts may not have the same impact in non-native learning contexts (Lakhwe 2016, Ghadi, Biddou and Boukanouf 2016). This case study seeks to identify the main tenets of the Communicative Approach in non-native contexts, and to recommend essential components to its application. The study is based on data collected from 198 students doing English communication skills courses and 45 participating English tutors in an English foreign language (EFL)university context, Lebanon. Findings suggest that performance remains the evidence of competence; however appropriate language performance is essentially reflective of a tripod model of CLT that incorporates correct linguistic application, appropriate sociolinguistic awareness and higher order strategic maneuverability.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T10:55:48.308605,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-10T04:17:48.516017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h379r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h379r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h379r/citation/,h379r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h379r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a3eb7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h379r/relationships/node/,a3eb7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h379r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58eb06cd594d9002500b25f2/,58eb06cd594d9002500b25f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h379r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h379r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h379r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h379r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h379r,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.1

Learners are different from each other and this difference matters in learner-centred instruction. This work is an attempt to identify the students’ learning-style and brain-dominance profiles at the Department of English, Larbi Ben M’hidi University, Oum el Bouaghi, Algeria. Seventy two Master Two-level students took part in this study. The Barsch Learning-Style Inventory and the Brain-Dominance Inventory were used as data collection tools. The results show that most of the participants have a visual mode of learning, whether predominantly or in combination with the auditory mode. In addition, the majority of the students are found to have a slight preference either to the left- or the right-brain hemisphere. The paper eventually discusses ways to enable teachers to tailor classroom instructional strategies to students’ learning preferences, and hence capitalize on their learning strengths.",TRUE,FALSE,brain dominance|learning process|learning styles|teaching strategies,2018-07-02T10:55:48.275316,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-10T03:42:20.056761,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zagk5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zagk5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zagk5/citation/,zagk5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zagk5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3b9pa/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zagk5/relationships/node/,3b9pa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zagk5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58eafe95b83f69024eb8a16a/,58eafe95b83f69024eb8a16a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zagk5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zagk5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zagk5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zagk5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zagk5,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.28

It was observed that students in Moroccan high schools are generally not able to speak their minds out freely and imaginatively in English. This paper studies the causes for students’ weak speaking skills in the English language and suggests solutions to mend the situation. An observation of the teaching and learning practices took place in a sample Moroccan high school and interviews as well as questionnaires were administered for the aim of tracing the obstacles students face in their learning process as well as their preferences that they wish to have applied in the speaking sessions. Several speaking activities were tested and proved effective in encouraging students to speak English in class and defeat their shyness and reluctance to express their opinions. These activities are provided in this paper for teachers to use starting from common core classes passing by 1st year Baccalaureate( Bac )and ending with 2nd year Bac (common core being the first year of high school in Morocco and so on) and include watching films and conducting projects in the framework of a cooperative learning. They outline a project of forming good speakers of English in Morocco and maybe elsewhere in the Arab world.,TRUE,FALSE,English as a Foreign Language (EFL)|English speaking activities|English speaking obstacles|Moroccan high school EFL teaching,2018-07-02T10:55:48.245695,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-04-10T03:38:54.980348,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4q5t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4q5t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4q5t/citation/,m4q5t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4q5t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9n2sv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4q5t/relationships/node/,9n2sv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4q5t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58eafcd5594d9002510b1328/,58eafcd5594d9002510b1328,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4q5t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4q5t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4q5t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m4q5t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m4q5t,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol8no1.27
