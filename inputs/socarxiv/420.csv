Inspired by this computational movement, this study uses Bayesian networks analysis, combining both the frequentist and the Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, to investigate the highly representative elements in the cultural evolution of a Vietnamese city’s architecture in the early 20th century. With a focus on the façade design of 68 old houses in Hanoi’s Old Quarter (based on 78 data lines extracted from 248 photos), the study argues that it is plausible to look at the aesthetics, architecture, and designs of the house façade to find traces of cultural evolution in Vietnam, which went through more than six decades of French colonization and centuries of sociocultural influence from China. The in-depth technical analysis, though refuting the presumed model on the probabilistic dependency among the variables, yields several results, the most notable of which is the strong influence of Buddhism over the decorations of the house façade. Particularly, in the top 5 networks with the best Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) scores and p&lt;0.05, the variable for decorations (DC) always has a direct probabilistic dependency on the variable B for Buddhism. The paper then checks the robustness of these models using Hamiltonian MCMC method and find the posterior distributions of the models’ coefficients all satisfy the technical requirement. Finally, this study suggests integrating Bayesian statistics in the social sciences in general and for the study of cultural evolution and architectural transformation in particular.",TRUE,FALSE,Bayesian network|Buddhism|cultural evolution|Franco-Chinese style|French colonialism|Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo|Hanoi architecture|house façade|Old Quarter,2019-01-26T15:43:02.447918,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-26T15:42:34.662985,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7f|Arts and Humanities|Other Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c80|Arts and Humanities|Other Languages, Societies, and Cultures|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cab|Arts and Humanities|Fine Arts|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf0|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Asian Art and Architecture|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d33|Arts and Humanities|Art and Design|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/citation/,7p9zf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4c4e1dbf723100187952f3/,5c4c4e1dbf723100187952f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7p9zf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7p9zf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7p9zf

With false news stories in mind, scholars are increasingly interested in redesigning our information ecosystem because well-informed individuals are essential for a functioning democracy. This paper addresses the problem awareness of university students about false news stories. With the help of a questionnaire we seek for interesting correlations to generate hypotheses that can be analyzed in further studies with new data (i.e. exploratory study). They read as follows: (i) Facebook users are more likely to be suspicious of false news stories if they are interested in political topics. People are less likely to detect false news stories the stronger they trust in others and the more emphasis they put on the opinions of others, (ii) False news stories are perceived as a problem at the societal level, but not at the individual level, (iii) Men more often than women believe to be in touch with false news stories; men overestimate their ability to spot false news stories.

However, game-theoretic and institutional models suggest that cooperatives may be inherently fragile due to the individual costs of cooperation. Because of this it is widely believed that organizations which rely less on cooperation may be more stable, while organizations that require cooperation may be at higher risk of folding. Therefore, if cooperatively owned or managed businesses do in fact require higher levels of prosocial and cooperative behavior than hierarchically managed firms, they must attract and maintain cooperation among participants in order to function. We hypothesized that successful consumer food cooperatives will exhibit greater generalized cooperation than conventional grocery stores. We employed an experimental dictator game to measure altruistic cooperation among consumers at a food cooperative and a comparable conventional grocery. Cooperative customers exhibit a higher base rate of cooperation than similar conventional food shoppers, and this relationship holds even when taking demographic factors such as income, education, and age into account. We conclude that, when successful, consumer food cooperatives exhibit greater levels of cooperation than comparable traditional businesses.",TRUE,FALSE,cooperation|dictator game|experimental economics|food cooperatives|prosociality,2019-01-25T21:45:08.711511,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-25T21:44:51.386017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,Ethan Tremblay|Afton Hupper|Timothy Waring,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/citation/,6x9p3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4b6f27bf723100167a1013/,5c4b6f27bf723100167a1013,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6x9p3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6x9p3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6x9p3

It started in 2011, partially due to the ripple effect caused by Arab Spring in the nations along the West Asian and North African (WANA) regions, and also due to the resentment of the population to the Syrian regime led by Bashar Al Assad. What began as peaceful protests in March 2011 erupted into violent, brutal attacks, all culminating into the bloodiest conflict in the 21st century, which saw intervention by many State and non-State actors like Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra Front and the like. The involvement of foreign powers led by the US and its allies in Europe and West Asia exacerbated the situation, when they started arming, funding and training rebels and/or terrorist groups. The other prominent actors like Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia supported the rebels and/or terrorist groups, while the Syrian forces were supported by Iran, Iraq and Lebanon-based militia group, Hezbollah, and lately by the Kurdish groups.

A disadvantage of this index is however, that only national values are available, whereas within many countries huge subnational variation in development exists. Here we present the Subnational Human Development Index (SHDI), which shows within-country variation in human development across the globe. Covering more than 1600 regions within 160 countries, the SHDI and its dimension indices provide a ten times higher-resolution picture than was available before.

In this review, we argue that greater investment in automation would be one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to boost the reliability, validity, and utility of social science research. We identify five core areas ripe for potentially transformative investment, including (1) machine-readable standards, (2) data access platforms, (3) search and discoverability, (4) claim validation, and (5) insight generation. In each case, we review limitations associated with current practices, identify concrete opportunities for improvement via automation, and discuss near-term barriers to progress. We conclude with a discussion of practical and ethical considerations researchers will need to keep in mind when working to enhance and accelerate social science progress via automation.",TRUE,FALSE,automation|data access|data sharing|discoverability|social science|standardization|validation,2019-01-25T14:16:01.778300,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-25T14:15:37.255930,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Tal Yarkoni|Dean Eckles|James A.

He claims that as women have demanded less from men in exchange for sex, the institution of marriage has been undermined. Regnerus suggests that shifts in women’s sexual behavior have “cheapened” sex because straight men are no longer obliged to offer concessions such as protection, resources, attention, or fidelity to gain access to sex with women. Thus, according to Regnerus, the decline in marriage—and the nuclear family—is caused by women’s newfound willingness to be “promiscuous.” These claims represent a nostalgic plea for a time when young women were expected to wait for marriage to have sex, accept reproduction as a likely outcome of sex, and rely on the material resources of a male partner. These claims are provocative.

This study examines how gender inequalities in evaluations depend on the design of the tools used to judge merit. Exploiting a quasi-natural experiment at a large North American university, we found that the number of scale points used in faculty teaching evaluations—whether instructors were rated on a scale of 6 versus a scale of 10—significantly affected the size of the gender gap in evaluations. A survey experiment, which presented all participants with an identical lecture transcript but randomly varied instructor gender and the number of scale points, replicated this finding and suggested that the number of scale points affects the extent to which gender stereotypes of brilliance are expressed in quantitative ratings. These results highlight how seemingly minor technical aspects of performance ratings can have a major effect on the evaluation of men and women. Our findings thus contribute to a growing body of work on organizational practices that reduce workplace inequalities and the sociological literature on how rating systems—rather than being neutral instruments—shape the distribution of rewards in organizations.",TRUE,FALSE,classification systems|employment|gender|higher education|inequalities|performance evaluations|teaching evaluations|work and occupations,2019-01-25T03:03:26.801447,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-25T03:02:45.271138,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Lauren A.
