From the language classroom comes further the wider social context of university in which EFL students learn outside the formal learning environment in relation to the opportunities to use and to be exposed to the target language. Two data collection methods are employed: questionnaires and interviews. It is revealed that the students perceive that the wider social context indeed influences their learning experiences outside as well as in the language classroom in two major aspects: self-development in English use and drawing on English as a common means of communication or a lingua franca (ELF) whereby there is an implicit search for similarities through English. Many further report that the specific university culture and its environment play a great role in their English learning, motivating or demotivating them to use English for communication. Implications from the study can be made to Thai EFL universities to focus on the stance on English and their efforts to make the school environment more conducive to English use and learning.",TRUE,FALSE,English as a foreign language (EFL) English as a lingua franca (ELF)|school Culture|social context|university learners,2019-07-21T21:16:22.608866,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:16:11.720411,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/citation/,53dvt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bce931c5b4a001aa462bd/,5d2bce931c5b4a001aa462bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/53dvt/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/53dvt

The theory, which developed in and by contrastivity between 1976 and 2005, is built on the basic assumption that utterances exhibit on their surface observable traces of the utterer's invisible structuring activity. It is  initially derived from a corpus-based approach to English and applied to languages as different as French, Arabic, Turkish, Madagascan, and Kwa languages. The theory's visibility is investigated primarily in relation to its readability and translatability.The findings suggest that visibility retarders and obstructers are more associated with a general context of global scientific publication marked by the hegemony of English as the language of science  than with the theoretical framework itself. However, if the model's body of knowledge and conceptual apparatus lend themselves to smooth interlingual transfer, as shown in books of Metaoperational inspirations in Spanish (Matte Bon (1992)), Italian (Gagliardelli (1999)), English (Adamczewski (2002)), and Arabic (Kahlaoui (2010)), the theory's high degree of formalism and its dense metalinguistic description are in some didactic contexts generative of reader frustration.",TRUE,FALSE,Enunciative approach|metalinguistic status|metaoperational linguistics|readability|translatability|visibility,2019-07-21T21:14:42.228540,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:14:34.084693,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/citation/,27fm8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bccc9a26b3400180a4351/,5d2bccc9a26b3400180a4351,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27fm8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/27fm8/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/27fm8

Comparing co-authorships and acknowledgements in political science journals from Germany,"Scientific research on academic collaboration focuses on co-authorships, citations and acknowledgements as ‘reward triangle’. However, acknowledgements have received comparatively little attention. In this paper, we compare co-authorship and acknowledgement networks and investigate conditions that influence their formation (gender, institutional affiliation and status of authors and acknowledged individuals). We select three sub-disciplinary political science journals from Germany between 2010 and 2017. We employ techniques from social network analysis to compare these conditions by using homophily measures. The results demonstrate that co-authorships have a rather sparse network while including acknowledgements reveals hidden collaboration structures. Moreover, scholars from the same institution are more likely to co-author and acknowledge each other while we show heterophily effects for acknowledging and co-authoring behavior of professors. We also identify an underrepresentation of female academics as authors and credit-givers alike. Thus, our exploratory study reveals similarities and differences patterns for co-authorships and acknowledgements providing new ground for future studies on all aspects of collaborative behavior in science.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic collaboration|acknowledgements|co-authorship|Germany|political science|social network analysis,2019-07-14T23:06:47.008316,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-14T23:06:20.544415,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/citation/,bg4qz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2b73fd1c5b4a001ca08286/,5d2b73fd1c5b4a001ca08286,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bg4qz/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bg4qz

Biases in online listings' representativeness could impact different communities' access to housing search information, reinforcing traditional information segregation patterns through a digital divide. They could also circumscribe housing practitioners' and researchers' ability to draw broad market insights from listings to understand rental supply and affordability. This study examines millions of Craigslist rental listings across the US and finds that they spatially concentrate and over-represent whiter, wealthier, and better-educated communities. Other significant demographic differences exist in age, language, college enrollment, rent, poverty rate, and household size. Most cities' online housing markets are digitally segregated by race and class, and we discuss various implications for residential mobility, community legibility, gentrification, housing voucher utilization, and automated monitoring and analytics in the smart cities paradigm. While Craigslist contains valuable crowdsourced data to better understand affordability and available rental supply in real-time, it does not evenly represent all market segments. The Internet promises information democratization, and online listings can reduce housing search costs and increase choice sets. However, technology access/preferences and information channel segregation can concentrate such information-broadcasting benefits  in already-advantaged communities, reproducing traditional inequalities and reinforcing residential sorting and segregation dynamics.

The answer to this question reaches beyond demographics, encompassing histories of family inequality, LGBTQ identity, and social movements. Presentations of gay fathers in the media and scholarship are often skewed toward white, middle-class, coupled men who became parents via adoption or surrogacy. Yet the demographic majority of gay parents continue to have children in heterosexual unions. My dissertation research uses ethnographic and interview data to argue that contemporary narratives of gay fatherhood have prematurely dismissed gay parents who have children in heterosexual unions. The choice to exclude gay fathers via heterosexual unions can be attributed to emerging narratives of LGBTQ identity and political strategies of the marriage equality movement. The consequences of gay fathers’ disproportionate visibility have led to a stratified system of access to gay parenting resources. By identifying the mechanisms that undermine gay fathers’ diversity in the public imagination and in gay parenting community settings, my dissertation amplifies the voices of marginalized gay fathers and offers an intersectional approach to the study of LGBTQ families through a social movements framework.",TRUE,FALSE,community|family|fatherhood|gay|gender|identity|kinship|LGBTQ|normativity|sexuality|social movements|sociology|visibility,2019-07-12T23:32:26.119534,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-12T23:31:45.365152,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/citation/,e3yva,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2911e5114a42001805144e/,5d2911e5114a42001805144e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e3yva/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e3yva

In this report it is argued based on government documents that the state's long-term stability maintenance strategy in Xinjiang is predicated upon a perverse and extremely intrusive combination of forced or at least involuntary training and labor, intergenerational separation and social control over family units.

In this article, I draw on ethnographic research of a small public library in a diverse, mostly working class neighborhood in Queens, New York. I show that in addition to providing an alternative to the capitalist market by distributing resources according to people’s needs, the library serves as a moral underground space, where middle class people bend rules to help struggling city residents. Although the library occasionally replicates hegemonic ideologies about immigrant assimilation, it provides a striking example of cross-class and inter-class solidarities and resistance to the neoliberal social order. I conclude by discussing the potential of public libraries as everyday spaces of subversion and emancipation, as well as research sites for urban scholars.",TRUE,FALSE,austerity|capitalism|library|moral underground|neoliberalism|New York|public space|real utopias|resistance|solidarity,2019-07-12T18:05:21.162060,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-12T18:05:02.198000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxmup/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxmup/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxmup/citation/,jxmup,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxmup/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxmup/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxmup/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d28c6ea114a42001804eda4/,5d28c6ea114a42001804eda4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxmup/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxmup/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jxmup/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jxmup/,https://doi.org/10.1111/cico.12417,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jxmup

I investigate the racial and ethnic compositions of stably integrated communities as well as the characteristics that distinguish these places. Using the information theory index (H) among stably diverse places, I identify cities and suburbs that were racially integrated between 2000 and 2010. Integrated places cluster in highly diverse, coastal metropolitan areas and almost entirely within suburbs. Moreover, integration is firmly patterned along racial lines. Reflecting the antiblack nature of segregation in the US, the rate of black-white integration remains remarkably low (10.5%), but in multiethnic communities with Asians and Latinxs, the probability of black-white integration nearly quadruples (40.1%). Several critical features of place are positively associated with integration: military and public sector employment as well as public university enrollment; new housing stock; and metropolitan political fragmentation. This study shows that suburbs are at the leading edge of American diversification and integration and illuminates the existence of communities where American society transgresses persistent forms of racial discrimination.",TRUE,FALSE,Diversity|Race and ethnicity|Racial integration|Suburbs,2019-07-12T18:04:22.450723,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-12T18:03:58.492434,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,Ankit Rastogi,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gtv8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gtv8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gtv8/citation/,3gtv8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gtv8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gtv8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gtv8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2884221c5b4a001d9fe9f3/,5d2884221c5b4a001d9fe9f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gtv8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gtv8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3gtv8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3gtv8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3gtv8

The representation of women and ethnic groups in TED talks,"We investigate the representation of women and ethnic groups in TED talks, which reach a large online audience on YouTube with science-related content and topics on societal change. We argue that gaps in representation can create a misleading perception of science and the respective topics discussed in these talks. We validate annotations from an image recognition algorithm for identifying speaker ethnicity and gender to compile a data set of 2,333 TED talks and 1.2 million YouTube comments. Findings show that more than half of all talks were given by white male speakers. While the share of women increased over time, it is constantly low for non-white speakers. Topic modeling further shows that the share of talks addressing inequalities which affect both groups is low, but increasing over time. However, talks about inequalities and those given by female speakers receive substantially more negative sentiment on YouTube than others. Our findings highlight the importance of speaker and topic diversity on digital platforms to reduce stereotypes about scientists and science-related content.",TRUE,FALSE,computational social science|ethnic groups|representation|TED|women|YouTube,2019-07-12T17:59:44.740491,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-12T17:59:23.847718,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d69vw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d69vw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d69vw/citation/,d69vw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d69vw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d69vw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d69vw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d287f6b1c5b4a001d9fe523/,5d287f6b1c5b4a001d9fe523,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d69vw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d69vw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d69vw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d69vw/,https://doi.org/10.1080/2474736X.2019.1646102,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d69vw
