In short, no.
The U.S. Tax Court will not apply the OECD BEPS Action 9 Recommendation regarding risk allocation for three reasons. (1) Two Constitutional reasons: (a) the Constitutional cavalcade of hierarchy regarding international law in the United States—much less the precedential value of a secondary source, such as OECD reports. (b) The concept of stare decisis that is embedded in the common law system of the Anglo-American tradition relies on cases being decided as they have been decided in the past. The tradition of upholding prior precedent is not easily broken—except for egregious reasons, such as regarding slavery. 
(2) Given the status of international law and international secondary sources in the United States in addition to the concept of stare decisis, the U.S. Tax Court—as all courts in the United States—consistently build on judicial application of law. Four key transfer pricing cases since the 1986 transfer pricing tax reforms in the United States will be shown to support the concept of stare decisis.
(3) Finally, the most recent transfer pricing case—Amazon—shows that the Court still upholds the prior precedential cases through stare decisis. Moreover—and perhaps more importantly in the international context regarding other countries’ decision to implement Action 9—had the IRS brought the argument of Action 9 forward, not only would the entire case would have been analyzed differently, but the prospect of bringing Action 9’s reasoning forward, the IRS would have for forfeited all claims to the pricing of the transferred intellectual property (IP) to the “empty company”—as will be shown later.",TRUE,FALSE,BEPS|International Tax Law|OECD|Transfer Pricing|US Tax Law,2018-07-02T11:10:48.816091,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-05T23:43:11.412543,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1e|Law|Taxation-Transnational,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/citation/,nf98w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u7tkr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/relationships/node/,u7tkr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59af358fb83f69025483a9da/,59af358fb83f69025483a9da,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nf98w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nf98w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nf98w,NA

Contrary to Huntington’s suggestion, I argue that new democracies growing out of mass mobilization are more likely to survive than new democracies that were born amidst quiescence. Survival analysis of 112 young democracies in 80 different countries based on original data show that the longer the mobilization, the more likely the ensuing democracy is to survive. I use a case study of South Africa to investigate the mechanisms. I argue that sustained unarmed uprisings have generated the longest-lasting new democracies.

The LGBT movement is actually multiple movements made up of numerous strands developed over time. This developmental approach views movements as a set of organizations and actors who are best served by keeping these numerous strands active and available to call on in times of need. In uncertain political times where the movement seeks to defend its gains and gain new ones, it can resist decline by activating and institutionalizing these numerous strands.

Why might such norms persist?  Existing approaches see this issue as an information problem, where individuals misconstrue a norm as popular among others, and conform so as to feign their endorsement.  But even when the unpopularity of the norm is revealed, conformity sometimes continues.  My theory thus identifies when and why individuals might conform to such visibly unpopular norms by focusing on the need to credibly signal commitment to their interactants in nascent relationships.  For embedded relationships to be beneficial, individuals need to discern whether their relationship partners are committed to collective interests over individual interests.  In this context, conformity to a visibly unpopular norm signals that the conformist is willing to violate her own preference to meet a behavioral standard demanded by the collective (i.e., norm).  Insofar as actors recognize this signaling value, visibly unpopular norms persist.  Using both qualitative and experimental methods, I leverage a visibly unpopular “ideal-worker” norm – norm around excessive drinking in after-hour business gatherings in South Korea – to test this theory. A macro implication is that an unpopular norm might persist not despite visible unpopularity but precisely because of visible unpopularity.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:10:46.295580,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T17:36:00.350743,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Minjae Kim,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/citation/,93krj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wmvez/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/relationships/node/,wmvez,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ac3cdd594d9002537d710f/,59ac3cdd594d9002537d710f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93krj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/93krj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/93krj,NA

It was used in a campaign to promote ""accurate"" knowledge about the suitable age range for pregnancy and was published in a supplementary textbook of health education for high schools in 2015. The author criticizes the use of the graph as well as the use of other unreliable research findings in the campaign that has resulted in the spread of unscientific knowledge in Japan today.

To convey the message, translators need to take into account not only the text, but also extra linguistic factors such as the target audience. The present paper claims that adaptation is an unavoidable translation strategy when dealing with texts that are heavy with religious and cultural themes. The translation task becomes even more challenging when dealing with children’s literature as the audience is children whose comprehension, experience and world knowledge is limited. The study uses the Arabic translation of the short story “Christmas Every Day” by William Dean Howells (1837- 1920) as a case study. The short story will be translated and the pragmatic problems involved will be discussed. The focus will be on the issue of adaptation. i.e., the source text should be adapted to the target language audience`s social and cultural environment.",TRUE,FALSE,Adaptation|Arabic audience|children's literature|equivalence|translation,2018-07-02T11:10:45.943155,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T02:59:45.325545,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3pxe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3pxe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3pxe/citation/,r3pxe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3pxe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e5tga/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3pxe/relationships/node/,e5tga,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3pxe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ab6f946c613b02526a1ae8/,59ab6f946c613b02526a1ae8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3pxe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3pxe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r3pxe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r3pxe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r3pxe,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no3.15

This personality disorder results basically from the poet's inability to socialize and merge into his local society which denies him both his masculinity and recognition as a poet. The study also deals with the repercussions of the poet's psychosis which reduces him to sadism, narcissism, and perversion. As a result, the poet is resolved to get revenge on the tribe through tarnishing the chastity of its women and depicting sexual savagery towards them in his poems. The study results find that these poems are nothing but mere delusions and Suhaym has to pay the price eventually by being burned to death.",TRUE,FALSE,flirting-poetry|perversion|psychosis|revolt|Suhaym|tribe.,2018-07-02T11:10:45.910142,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-09-03T02:56:08.231987,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3kt6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3kt6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3kt6/citation/,y3kt6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3kt6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/652uv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3kt6/relationships/node/,652uv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3kt6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59ab6e626c613b02536a024c/,59ab6e626c613b02536a024c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3kt6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3kt6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y3kt6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y3kt6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y3kt6,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol1no3.14
