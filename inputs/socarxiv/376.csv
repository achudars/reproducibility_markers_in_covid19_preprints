Student engagement happens at many levels that correspond to the “principles of good practice in undergraduate education” that were suggested by Chickering and Gamson (1987).  This article tries to identify these aspects of student engagement and good practice in the English Studies Track (EST) program from the EST students’ perspective. The data were collected in three Moroccan universities: Abdelmalek Essaadi University in Tetouan, Ibn Tofail University in Kenitra, and Cadi Ayad University in Marrakech. An adapted version of Student Engagement Questionnaire (Kember, Leung &amp; McNaught, 2009 in Kember &amp; Leung, 2009) was administered to 883 EST students. The data were submitted to a statistical analysis of frequencies using SPSS. The results of this study show that EST students experience a low level of engagement with their studies and that the EST program lacks some aspects of “good practice” in higher education.  This study can help enhance the quality of university programs as it reveals some gaps and negative practices that need to be taken into account in the reform process Moroccan universities are going through. Another implication of this research is that students are aware of their needs and, hence, are able to provide useful feedback that can be used to improve the quality of the teaching and learning environment in Moroccan universities.",TRUE,FALSE,Moroccan university reform|quality enhancement|student engagement|student needs,2019-10-11T16:50:02.469483,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11T16:47:06.153745,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/citation/,9zx7s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da00ff3a7bc73000dec6fa4/,5da00ff3a7bc73000dec6fa4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9zx7s/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.11,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9zx7s

In general, the Saudi students face difficulty to develop the writing competence in a foreign language because they rely on instructors as a sole source of knowledge. Therefore, the study investigated the English language writing in a university in Saudi Arabia. It implemented an action research design based on three main phases; namely, exploration, intervention, and reflection stage. The main questions asked include how the instructors view the writing style of students within the setting and how they perceived the English language writing curricula among the students. The data drew several conclusions that provided insight into the Saudi Higher Education concerning English as a foreign language (EFL) classes. The first is the spoon-feeding of Saudi learners throughout their educational years; therefore, they find it challenging to gain hold of their learning. Second, writing in English is a challenging task for Saudi students. Third, some of the students memorize writing passages to pass their English course. Fourthly, teaching to write was done by focusing on form, writing mechanics, rather than communicative aspects of writing and genre.

Young adults represent a critical social group that needs special attention. Therefore, the present paper tackles one of the fascinating literary genres to young adults; young adult science fiction. The paper attempts to investigate how the social themes of order and chaos are delivered to young adults in young adult science fiction through conducting a critical stylistic analysis of certain extracts in selected young adult science fiction novels. The linguistic tool employed for the critical stylistic analysis is negation for its prevalent use in the discourse, in general, and for its textual effectiveness in rendering hidden ideologies, whether intended or unconscious.

The study also examines how their cognition and pedagogical practices interplayed with the ecological contexts in the setting in which they taught. Integral to the study was the use of semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, stimulated-recall interviews, and course document review. Constructivist grounded theory informed the data analysis. Results revealed that the instructors’ cognition about second language (L2) writing, about teaching and learning L2 writing, and about their professional roles influences their teaching approach, curriculum design, and classroom assessment methods. The findings also stressed the role of the ecological contexts as a mediating force influencing the interaction between cognition and practices. The classroom context was identified as the most significant barrier to teaching writing; however, gaining access to L2 writing scholarship was viewed as the most significant facilitator for implementing effective practices in the L2 writing classroom. The findings showed that the instructors’ cognition about themselves as professionals could mitigate the impact of the ecological constraints hindering L2 writing instruction. This finding of the role of cognition may explain why teachers working in the same context under the same conditions teach differently. The implications of these findings include the importance of encouraging EFL writing instructors to reflect upon their cognition, pedagogical practices, and working contexts and the need for introducing recommended models of L2 writing instruction in tertiary institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,contextual factors|Grounded theory|L2 writing|teacher cognition,2019-10-11T16:48:05.803794,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11T16:45:19.757928,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/citation/,hx23j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da00b1ca7bc73000eea3440/,5da00b1ca7bc73000eea3440,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hx23j/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hx23j

This quantitative study uses an online questionnaire, as an instrument, to collect the data. The results reveal that the English majors at PSAU face several problems in learning the vocabulary such as knowing the meanings of new words, pronouncing new words, using new words correctly, memorizing and spelling new vocabulary and so on.  To its contribution, this study emphasizes the importance of learning the English vocabulary, draws students’ attention towards it, highlights the problems encountered by students, and raises their awareness of the vocabulary.

It studies the cognitive frames that are mentally constructed and activated about illegal immigrants, in general, and Syrian refugees in particular. Any word class can evoke frames, but to limit the scope of analysis, Fairclough's socio-cultural approach is implemented to work out the experiential, relational and expressive values of only nouns and adjectives in media discourse. The corpus consists of articles released by The Guardian newspaper during and after the Syrian refugee crisis between 2015 and 2019. The results of the research show that cognitive frames are used to enhance the stereotypical categorizations of refugees as dislocated, uprooted and oppressed communities. This paper focuses on the mental mapping of such disadvantaged people and how they are categorized and presented in media discourse.

The article from a university instructor’s experience aims to bring forward the reasons the WC at Lebanese universities is slowly attracting students to its provided practices and how disciplinary instructors amongst other socio-cultural factors are contributing towards students misconceptions of the WC philosophy and services.  The article first introduces the profile of the Lebanese university English as a foreign language (EFL) student to provide a background on their English language level of proficiency and expectations from the WC tutors and the misguided understanding of the WC philosophies and framework practices that are opposing students’ expectations from the WC; and continues to construct the need for the WC to re-evaluate its current writing pedagogy and process between tutor and student.  The article concludes by discussing the negotiated roles WC tutors, disciplinary instructors and faculty management should take in order to transfer students’ misconception of the WC aims and objectives and to take responsibility for their writing.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-10-11T16:41:41.204640,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11T16:40:31.392434,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/citation/,wyc58,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da00657f6b03e00101cfa49/,5da00657f6b03e00101cfa49,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wyc58/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wyc58

The background of learning theories, assessment types, and self-assessment literature provides a foundation for further discussion of the appropriate use of rubrics, including the prioritization of criterion, the quality of scoring, the impact of organizational features on scoring, the influence of bias, and the best application of rubric assessment. Relevant points for further study are identified, such as differentiation in research between generalized analytical rating systems and rubric assessment with specific, empirical criterion. The contradictory research regarding the advantages and disadvantages of rubric assessment in comparison with holistic assessment are of particular and crucial interest for global pedagogy. Many of the reviewed Western articles excluded Asian perspectives- except for China- and thus present a limited understanding of social and educational compatibility with new assessments and rubric assessments in particular. The discussion identifies patterns and points of contention and seeks to explore viewpoints rather than limit the scope of inquiry and consideration thus noting that relevant literature suggests that with appropriate teacher training, teachers may appropriately use rubrics as a formative assessment tool for writing in Asia and the Middle East.",TRUE,FALSE,Asia|education|formative assessment|Middle East|professional development|rater|rubric|scoring|summative assessment,2019-10-11T16:40:01.895452,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11T16:38:54.828730,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/citation/,p9tjc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da00526a7bc73000cea60f3/,5da00526a7bc73000cea60f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p9tjc/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p9tjc
