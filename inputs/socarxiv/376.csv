Most
attention focused on assessing levels of racial segregation at the spatial scale of a metropolitan area. In this paper, we present an analysis of 1990-2010 changes to racial diversity and segregation on a much smaller spatial scale of an urban census tract. To access time-standardized racial information at the tract and at the census block scales we use multiyear compatible high-resolution population grids. Indices of racial diversity and segregation are calculated for over 30,000 tracts pooled from 41 metropolitan areas. Statistical analysis of this dataset reveals that during the 1990-2010 period urban tracts increased their diversity in line with diversity increases of entire metro areas, but unlike metros, they also increased their levels of segregation. We hypothesize that an increased tendency for the residences of people of the same race to spatially aggregate on the tract scale is the result of individuals exercising preferences regarding their neighbors in reaction to the nationwide increase in diversity of the American population. The study also re-derives diversity and segregation indices from the first principles of the information theory, highlights the need to think about the issue of racial diversity/segregation in terms of spatial patterns, and uses one-person-per-dot maps to connect diversity/segregation indices to actual racial patterns.",TRUE,FALSE,information theory|Racial diversity|segregation|visualization,2019-05-03T14:28:09.825212,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-03T14:26:45.575192,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Tomasz F.

Exploring Ireland’s Vegan and Vegetarian Foodscape,"While it would not be accurate to suggest that Ireland is a hub of veganism or vegetarianism, too often it is written off as inherently unsympathetic to the ethics of plant-based eating and anti-speciesist politics. While it is true that Irish culture is historically tied to speciesism and its economy is especially dependent upon “meat” and dairy production, Ireland’s relationship with other animals is complex and sometimes forgiving. This essay seeks to bring shape to the Irish vegan ethic, one that can be traced along its history of animism, agrarianism, ascendency, adaptation, and activism. From its pagan roots to its legacy of vegetarianism, Ireland’s history has been more receptive to Nonhuman Animal interests than might be currently understood. Its contributions to the modern Nonhuman Animal rights movement and developments in green agriculture must also be taken into account.

This institutionalized sexism not only inhibits women’s ability to protest safely and effectively, but also permeates the activist imagination and aggravates interpersonal violence. Even Nonhuman Animals as a feminized group are unwittingly disparaged in popular campaigns. This essay suggests that structural sexism in the Nonhuman Animal rights movement is nourished by its patriarchal organization, specifically its decision to professionalize. Twenty-first century vegan feminist activism on the margins has been able to circumvent the hegemony of professionalized power and challenge taken-for-granted bureaucratic structures. Yet, despite indications that vegan feminist activists are influencing the movement dialogue, the movement’s patriarchal norms have encouraged considerable pushback. Indeed, the patriarchal influence of professionalization has even created division between second wave and third wave vegan feminists.",TRUE,FALSE,Animal Rights|Critical Animal Studies|Digital Culture|Digital Protest|Ecofeminism|Factionalism|Feminism|Intersectionality|Nonprofit Industrial Complex|Nonprofits|Professionalization|Social Movements|Solidarity|Veganism,2019-05-03T14:23:07.327391,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-03T14:22:46.738656,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,Corey Wrenn,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/citation/,jtps8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccaf2cdd7dc3f00176d10d0/,5ccaf2cdd7dc3f00176d10d0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jtps8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jtps8,NA

Prices of 25 and 50 dollars per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions cause electricity emissions reductions of 17% and 22% from present levels, respectively. This suggests significant electricity sector emissions reductions can be achieved quickly from a modest carbon tax. Short run effects refer to operational changes at existing U.S. power plants, mostly by switching production from coal plants to natural gas plants. The results do not include long run emissions reductions related to 1) new investments and retirements of electricity production assets, and 2) demand response as regulated electricity suppliers pass cost changes to retail customers. A state-level analysis of the results leads to the following conclusions: 1) most emissions reductions come from high coal-consuming states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, 2) fifteen states increase emissions because their natural gas consumption offsets coal consumption in neighboring states, and 3) a flat per-capita rebate of tax revenue leads to wealth transfers across states.",TRUE,FALSE,Carbon tax|Climate change|Electricity markets|Energy economics|Energy policy,2019-05-01T11:40:21.395393,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-01T11:40:10.857017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/citation/,b79yu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/59pf6/,59pf6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc8b66e00a81000175d8b54/,5cc8b66e00a81000175d8b54,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b79yu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b79yu,https://doi.org/10.3390/en12112150

The steward is an individual who practices in a field in a manner that invites and warrants the trust of the public, other practitioners, and employers to uphold and maintain the integrity of that field. It is important to your sense of professional identity - and also your profession - to cultivate a sense of stewardship; and one of the foundational aspects of stewardly behavior is to understand professional practice guidelines and the types of behaviors that are expected by practitioners in a given field. Therefore, this article presents two sets of guidelines that can support professionalism, ethical practice, and the development of a coherent professional identity for the statistician and data scientist. The American Statistical Association (ASA) and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) are large professional organizations with international membership. An overall objective of each of these organizations is to promote excellence in and by their members and all those who practice in their respective – sometimes shared/joint – domains. It can be helpful to consider the field of ‘statistics and data science’ to be a hybrid of, or co-dependent on, these two fields, which is one reason why the two organizations are presented together. Another reason is that both organizations take ethical practice very seriously, and both engaged in lengthy projects to carefully revise their respective ethical guidelines for professional practice in 2018.  Not only does engagement with the guidelines support you initiating, and beginning to demonstrate, your commitment to this particular professional identity, but also exploring the ethical guidelines for professional practice (through ASA or ACM) is a first step towards documenting your commitment to stewardly work as a data scientist. Ethical reasoning, the third focus of this article, helps deepen the understanding of the guidelines and can be useful to generate evidence of stewardly development.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-05-01T11:40:02.631250,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-01T11:39:42.488588,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/citation/,93wuk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8e6jn/,8e6jn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc8aa4b42c4b70017b810b6/,5cc8aa4b42c4b70017b810b6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/93wuk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/93wuk,NA
