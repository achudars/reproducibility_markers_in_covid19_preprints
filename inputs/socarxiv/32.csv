The idea is not new. Perhaps the first government-directed quarantine system was mid-fourteenth-century Venice's  “quaranta giorni"",  forty days of mandated isolation for incoming ships. We propose a 5-item primary scale of ""social distancing"" behavior (KEK-3) and a slightly extended variant  (KEK-3m), developed for use during the COVID-19 epidemic (and, potentially, beyond). The candidate items all had 7 answer categories. Assessment aligns very well with the classical measurement model for multi-item scales: interitem correlations are high; alpha reliability is 0.86; correlations with criterion variables are similar across the candidate items; factor analysis (oblimin rotation) finds a single dimension with an eigenvalue over 1 and loadings around .7. We provide behavioral norms for America during the 2020 pandemic and describe KEK-3's links to demographic and socioeconomic factors. Developing a replicable scale  is especially important now, because many researchers are making erroneous comparisons using the same terminology to describe aspects of the epidemic which have been measured differently. To successfully assess the ""...meaning of social change related to COVID-19, the newly emerging social practices due to lockdown measures..."" (Esposito, Stark and Squazzoni 2020),  high-quality measurements sufficiently reliable and robust to be replicated in different times as the epidemic evolves and in different settings are desperately needed: KEK-3 contributes to  such a set of measures. Data:  four large national sample surveys conducted  April - July, 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic. Data collection was through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk.

Data from the International Social Science Survey and the international WVS/EVS surveys show that Americans' confidence in their police is, on average,  fairly typical of other advanced societies, coming 30th out of 110 nations worldwide. Within the US there was sharp political divergence. Democrats' confidence in the police plunged dramatically around the time of the killing, and then rebounded even more strongly later. But this was only among Democrats. Republicans' views were  stable across the period. Regression analysis reveals that that this pattern holds controlling for social and demographic factors, including race. The patterns of change in confidence in the police were replicated for trust in the police. In addition,  Blacks and Whites were equally confident in the police across most of the period, except that shortly after the murder Black's confidence plunged briefly and temporarily lower than their White peers';  the subsequent rebound in confidence was especially large among Blacks. Further multivariate analysis reveals that the degree of confidence people feel in the government as a whole is by far the largest determinant of how much confidence they feel in the police.  Sociodemographic factors other than race play no clear role. Racial prejudice is irrelevant. In short, all this is mainly party politics.",TRUE,FALSE,American Association for Public Opinion Research|confidence in police|Democrats|Floyd|national conference presentation|party politics|police|prejudice|race|Republicans,2021-04-19T03:16:28.577225,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-19T03:16:04.520480,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Authors,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydaru/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydaru/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydaru/citation/,ydaru,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydaru/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydaru/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydaru/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/607b8a06eb9cc901e714b31b/,607b8a06eb9cc901e714b31b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydaru/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydaru/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydaru/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ydaru/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ydaru,NA

This allows for the simultaneous visualization of the 3D model with embedded information, which becomes an integral part of it, and not just metadata. In this way, it was possible to create a system that al-lows the full enhancement of the whole of the information belonging to such a rich and complex context through decades of field researches recorded in a variety of ways of differing accuracy.

Second, we use a dataset enhanced by a commercial vendor to restrict the analysis to only those identified as working as financial advisors (n = 237,435). Using racially charged Google search queries as a proxy for racial animosity, we find that greater racial animosity is associated with greater Black advisor underrepresentation. We estimate lower underrepresentation of 0.9 percentage points when comparing markets with the highest and lowest levels of animosity.

Are citizens competent enough to vote directly on policy issues? When stakes are high, do citizens mainly follow elites’ signals or do they decide in line with their issue preferences? This article addresses these questions in a multi-method setting by combining observational and experimental data from an original three-wave panel survey conducted during the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum. In particular, Finite Mixture Models are employed to model voters’ heterogeneous strategies of information processing. Findings show that heuristic voting based on government evaluation prevails over policy-related voting. More specifically, less politically sophisticated and partisan voters relied on government assessment as a heuristic, while sophisticated and independent voters based their decisions mostly on their assessment of the reform.

The wide amount of readily available information provided by VAAs to users has been shown to contribute to reducing the transactional costs involved in gathering relevant political information. Available evidence also supports the idea that VAA users are more likely to cast a ballot in elections as a result. The extent to which electoral participation is caused by using a VAA, however, remains unclear. Against this background, we reassess the mobilizing effect of VAAs by means of a multi-method approach. Our cross-sectional analysis of 12 national election study data sets provides further support to the idea that VAA usage increases users’ chances of casting a ballot in elections as compared to non-users.

While there is evidence of this trend for presidential democracies, notably the United States, this linkage is yet to be fully explored for parliamentary democracies undergoing a process of personalization. This study addresses this gap through an analysis of pooled national election study data from thirteen Western European parliamentary democracies collected between 1982 and 2016.

An automated approach to measuring congruence between the pre and post-electoral discourse of parties using word embeddings,"The idea that electoral competition, party promises and manifestos are important for how the representative behaviour of parties unfolds post-electorally is central to democratic theories of representation. Scholars of Party Mandate fulfilment have for long been focusing methodologically on the number of pre-electoral pledges parties in government manage to realize. This paper analyses existing research and its limitations and proposes a novel approach for mandate fulfilment, extending past research (both conceptually and methodologically) by looking at the extent to which the parliamentary discourse of parties matches their electoral discourse. It designs, tentatively validates and implements a novel measure of how similar is the pre and post-electoral rhetoric of parties by utilizing recent advances in computational linguistics and the diffusion of text analysis tools in the social sciences. It applies it on the Irish parliament and compares electoral manifesto data with post-electoral parliamentary data from 1997 to 2019.",TRUE,FALSE,Discourse Congruence|Manifestos|Parliamentary Mandate Fulfilment|Parliamentary Speeches|Political Parties|Representation|Text Similarity|Word Embeddings,2021-04-18T15:28:10.018491,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-18T15:27:33.754307,FALSE,NA,no,"The annotated Irish parliamentary data was created within the context of the ERC MAPLE (Consolidator Grant No 682125) and is not in a public repository as of yet.

One of these threats is the act of terrorism which endangers the unity, sovereignty and security of the nation. Acts of terrorism are carried out to create a terror with ideological, political and religious motives and are carried out in vital objects of the state, the environment, and public facilities. One of the vital objects of a country that is prone to acts of terrorism is an airport, which is a place for various activities such as the movement of aircraft, people and goods. Moreover, an airport is a very important infrastructure in supporting the national defense. In this study, the researcher took Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, Makassar, as the research site considering that several large cases of terrorism and radicalism have occurred in the South Sulawesi region. The objective of this study is to analyze the total war strategy carried out in the Sultan Hasanuddin Airport area as an effort to prevent acts of terrorism at the airport as a vital national object. The research method used is qualitative. The data have been collected from interviews, observations and literature study. The results of this research are in preventing terrorism, a total war strategy that is implemented has three components, including the ‘ends,’ which could prevent the acts of terrorism in Sultan Hasanuddin Airport and strengthen the national defense. The ‘means’ which is manifested in all national components, both government and private agencies, military, police and civil society, as well as facilities and infrastructure. The ‘ways’ which is the intelligence operations, strengthening cooperation between the military and civilians, strengthening synergy between ministries / agencies, training, counseling, completing security tools to prevent acts of terrorism.",TRUE,FALSE,Airport|Prevention|Strategy|Terrorism|Total War,2021-04-18T15:29:42.585272,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-18T15:29:18.187443,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3sau/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3sau/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3sau/citation/,g3sau,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3sau/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3sau/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c7vbg/,c7vbg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3sau/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60790188c29ca800caeb411f/,60790188c29ca800caeb411f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3sau/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3sau/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3sau/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g3sau/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g3sau,https://doi.org/10.31014/aior.1991.04.02.277
