This study explores female faculty members’ feelings of isolation within their department across academic disciplines. Drawing on the theory of tokenism, I hypothesize that women faculty members in STEM disciplines, which have been historically male-dominated, are more likely to express a lesser sense of belonging in their department, than women faculty members in the Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities. I analyzed data from a 2009 online survey administered to tenure-track and tenured faculty at two highly selective liberal arts colleges. After restricting my analysis to women, I controlled for women’s familial responsibilities as well as their position within the academic institution. Unlike previous research at universities, OLS regression analysis showed that women in STEM actually expressed a higher level of fitting in their department than those in other disciplines. Examining the two colleges separately revealed that this result only applied to women at the former men’s college, which had a long history of strong STEM departments. For women faculty at the former women’s college, whose historic strengths were in the Arts and Humanities rather than STEM, there was no statistically significant relationship between being in STEM and fitting in their department. Instead, women who indicated that they were married at the former women’s college expressed greater feelings of belonging than their unmarried female counterparts.",TRUE,FALSE,academia|STEM|women,2018-12-21T22:58:28.105206,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-21T22:57:45.652155,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hvm6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hvm6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hvm6/citation/,2hvm6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hvm6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hvm6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hvm6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1d6b097cd9be001c5ba6e7/,5c1d6b097cd9be001c5ba6e7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hvm6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hvm6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2hvm6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2hvm6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2hvm6,NA

Using 1,240 responses from interviews conducted in the 2016 General Social Survey, regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between community size and environmental spending views while controlling for political view, family income, and years of education completed. The results from the bivariate analysis show no correlation between community size and environmental spending views, but a weak, positive correlation between political views and environmental spending views, suggesting that identifying as liberal is what drives environmental spending views. Additionally, bivariate results show a very weak, positive correlation between highest year of school completed and environmental spending views. In the multivariate results, this relationship disappeared, but political view remained a statistically significant variable on environmental spending views.

Higher education is deemed to be one of the most important factors associated with upward mobility and economic stability. While the achievement gap continues to widen, children of immigrants continue to struggle to assimilate and in gaining access to the white middle-class mainstream. Ultimately, the snowball effect of intergenerational low socioeconomic status rolls over on to the disadvantage immigrant children in the new generation. I propose that children of U.S. born parents have a greater educational attainment than children of immigrants. Using the 2016 General Social Survey (N= 1,899) ¬ this study investigates the relationship between parents’ place of birth and respondents’ educational attainment. At the bivariate level, children of immigrants attain fewer years of school. However, this relationship appears to be largely mediated by parental education. After controlling for sex, race, and perceived income at age 16, it was found that respondents' educational attainment is not greatly affected by parents' birthplace but by parents’ years of education completed. Guided by insights from Bourdieu’s theory of Habitus and straight-line assimilation theory, the findings show that education plays a major role in patterns related to the assimilation theory and the acquisition of the habitus.

Guided by Goffman’s (1963) social stigma theory and Gagnon and Simon’s (1973) sexual script theory, I propose that 1) the more strongly the respondent agrees he or she would disrespect women who hook up frequently, the fewer times he or she reports nonconsensual sex; 2) the more strongly the respondent agrees he or she would disrespect for men who hook up frequently, the fewer times he or she reports nonconsensual sex; and 3) the more strongly the respondent agrees he or she would be less interested in someone who hooks up frequently as a boyfriend/girlfriend, the fewer times he or she reports nonconsensual sex. Using the Online College Social Life Survey data collected between 2005 and 2011, I analyze the attitudes about and reports of sexual behaviors in a non-probability sample of 16,914 students at 21 U.S. colleges and universities. Controlling for sex, age, current religion preference, and Greek affiliation, disrespect towards women who hook up frequently is positively and significantly related to fewer reports of nonconsensual sex. However, the results do not support the second and third hypotheses as there is no statistically significant relationship between disrespect towards men who hook up frequently as well as the lack of interest in people who hook up frequently and the incidents of reported nonconsensual sex.

This paper extends current approaches in segregation measurement by presenting a five-term decomposition procedure that can be used to understand more clearly why segregation has changed or differs between two comparison points. Two of the five terms account for differences in segregation that are due to the differing marginal distributions (e.g., the gender and occupational distributions), while one term accounts for differences in segregation due the different structure of segregation (what might be termed “pure” segregation). The decomposition thus presents a solution to the problem of margin-dependency, frequently discussed in the segregation literature. Finally, two terms account for the appearance or disappearance of units when analyzing change over time. The method can be further extended to attribute structural changes to individual units, which makes it possible, for instance, to quantify the effect of each occupation on changing gender segregation. The practical advantages of the decomposition are illustrated by two examples: a study of changing occupational gender segregation in the U.S, and a study of changing residential segregation in Brooklyn, New York City.",TRUE,FALSE,decomposition|gender|segregation|segregation index|theil,2018-12-21T13:01:20.955512,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-21T12:57:35.798227,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,Benjamin Elbers,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/citation/,ya7zs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q57tj/,q57tj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1cdf361ae2f400173de223/,5c1cdf361ae2f400173de223,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ya7zs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ya7zs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ya7zs,https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124121986204

There is growing appreciation that cultural evolutionary processes may have played an important role in this emergence of this diversity. Historical factors such as the length of time societies have had experience with centralized political governance, or how long they have employed agricultural subsistence strategies have been presented as explanatory factors that have contributed to present-day economic performance. However, it is not clear whether duration of agriculture and ancestral statehood have exerted a direct effect on modern productivity, or whether they influence economies indirectly by shaping the evolution of norms or formal institutions. Here we use structural equation modelling and a global nation-level dataset to test between hypotheses involving a range of direct and indirect pathways. We show that the historical timing of agriculture predicts the timing of the emergence of statehood, which in turn affects economic development indirectly through its effect on institutions. Ecological factors appear to affect economic performance indirectly through their historical effects on the development of agriculture and by shaping patterns of European colonization.

Why are Chinese people unwilling to have children now even after the One-Child Policy has been abandoned? I propose that the government policy was not the single crucial factor affecting the reduction of births in China. Household income, education, and gender also may have played a role. I use the 2015 Chinese General Social Survey to analyze the relationships between these three factors and the ideal number of children. The sample size of this subset is 2,373. Ordinary least square regression reveals that the ideal number of children increases as household income increases, while increasing education reduces the ideal number of children. Gender of potential parents does not have an effect on predicting the ideal number of children. The findings support the effects of household income and education on fertility willingness but reject that of gender. This study contributes to a sociological perspective on the demography of China. It suggests from an institutional perspective which factors would need to be changed to increase individuals’ fertility willingness.",TRUE,FALSE,China|Education|Fertility Willingness|Gender|Household Income|Ideal Number of Children|One-Child Policy,2018-12-21T12:59:08.269822,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-21T12:54:59.269729,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p6ke/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p6ke/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p6ke/citation/,5p6ke,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p6ke/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p6ke/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p6ke/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1c4cbde4e3b300197ce622/,5c1c4cbde4e3b300197ce622,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p6ke/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p6ke/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5p6ke/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5p6ke/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5p6ke,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5p6ke

Evidence from the US Refugee Ban,"Many countries have reduced refugee admissions in recent years, in  part due to fears that refugees and asylum seekers increase crime rates and pose a national security risk. Existing research presents ambiguous expectations about the  consequences of refugee resettlement on crime. We leverage a natural experiment in the US, where an Executive Order by the president in January 2017 halted refugee resettlement. This policy  change was sudden and significant -- it resulted in the lowest number of refugees resettled on US soil since 1977 and  a 66% drop in resettlement from 2016 to 2017. In this letter we find that there is no discernible effect on county-level property or violent crime rates.",TRUE,FALSE,crime|immigration|refugees,2018-12-21T12:57:42.295105,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-12-21T12:53:59.392938,NA,NA,available,NA,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/KDOM7E,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics,Daniel Masterson and Vasil Yasenov,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2x7p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2x7p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2x7p/citation/,w2x7p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2x7p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2x7p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2x7p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c1c471867e1c70019850d45/,5c1c471867e1c70019850d45,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2x7p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2x7p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w2x7p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w2x7p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w2x7p,NA
