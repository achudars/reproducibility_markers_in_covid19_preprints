While many trademark courts have protected parodies, there are a surprising
number of cases that hold obvious parodies illegal. The problem is
particularly severe with respect to parodies that are used to brand
products, a growing category. The doctrinal tools that generally protect
expressive parodies often don't apply to brand parodies. Our goal in this
paper is to think about what circumstances (if any) should lead courts to
find parody illegal. We conclude that, despite courts’ increasing attention
to speech interests in recent years, the law’s treatment of parody reflects
too much uncertainty, leaving would-be parodists vulnerable to threats of
legal action by trademark holders. In particular, given the flexibility of
likelihood of confusion analysis, parodists’ fate is usually determined by
the subjective judgment of courts, whose treatment of parody often seems to
turn on instinct rather than trademark principles. We suggest some
doctrinal tools that offer greater predictability and quicker resolution of
parody cases, while avoiding some of the shortcomings of more traditional
infringement analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:03.541059,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:16:30.018000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htcxr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htcxr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htcxr/citation/,htcxr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htcxr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kymrj/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htcxr/relationships/node/,kymrj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htcxr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde47f594d9001fad0df47/,57bde47f594d9001fad0df47,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htcxr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htcxr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/htcxr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/htcxr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/htcxr

upon descriptions of technology. However, technologies may have qualities
that are unappreciated or unidentified in a patent description, but which
are nonetheless present. The law refers to these unknown attributes as
inherent in the product or process. What should be done about such
characteristics or qualities of a technology that exist but are not
explicitly described, either through ignorance or inadvertence? This
problem is explicitly presented in at least five different patent
doctrines: anticipation, the on-sale bar, priority disputes,
double-patenting, and enablement; and it casts its shadow across the law
governing subject matter, infringement, and obviousness.

Inherency is also perhaps the most elusive doctrine in all of patent law.
The cases appear to flatly contradict each other, are often accompanied by
dissents, and in the last three years alone have triggered one abortive en
banc rehearing and strong calls for a second. In particular, the courts
have split sharply over whether an element can be inherent in a prior art
reference even if people of ordinary skill in the art do not appreciate the
existence of that element.

In this Article, we argue that this confusion is largely unnecessary. While
many courts have recited as gospel the idea that inherency requires
knowledge or appreciation of the inherent element, in no case does the
application of the inherency doctrine actually turn on knowledge of the
element. Rather, the inherency cases are all ultimately about whether the
public already gets the benefit of the claimed element or invention. If the
public already benefits from the invention, even if they don't know why,
the invention is inherent in the prior art. If the public doesn't benefit
from the invention, there is no inherency.

In Part I, we examine the main thread of inherency cases, those arising out
of the novelty and statutory bar provisions of the Patent Act. We explain
how the courts got off track in their focus on knowledge, and why a focus
on benefit clearly and consistently explains the doctrine. In Part II, we
consider inherency in a different context, one in which the inventor must
show possession of the claimed invention, either to prevent a new matter
rejection or to establish priority of invention. Finally, in Part III, we
discuss the broader implications of this rule, including what the inherency
doctrine may mean for patents on DNA sequences and patents on drugs derived
from traditional knowledge. A proper understanding of the inherency
doctrine may offer a logical explanation for the product of nature cases,
undermining the last significant exception to patentable subject matter.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:12.808330,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:13:33.678000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/citation/,udnxw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gntch/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/relationships/node/,gntch,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde3cf6c613b01ecd9365c/,57bde3cf6c613b01ecd9365c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udnxw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/udnxw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/udnxw

inversion, those who argued less than a decade ago that cyberspace was a
place all its own - and therefore unregulable by territorial governments -
are finding their arguments and assumptions used for a very different end.
Instead of concluding that cyberspace is outside of the physical world,
courts are increasingly using the metaphor of cyberspace as a ""place"" to
justify application of traditional laws governing real property to this new
medium. Dan Hunter's excellent article explains how and why this is
happening with uncanny accuracy, pointing to the power of metaphor in
influencing legal thinking and the particular strength of metaphor in
making the new seem familiar. He also quite correctly observes that
reliance on the cyberspace as place metaphor is leading courts to results
that are nothing short of disastrous as a matter of public policy. Finally,
he concludes that there is no way for the Internet to escape the firmly
entrenched spatial metaphor, either by substituting another metaphor or by
eschewing metaphor altogether. Already, he concludes, the idea of
cyberspace as a place is too well-established in our minds. The result is a
paper that is both extraordinarily important and profoundly depressing.

In this essay, I do not challenge Hunter's argument that the cyberspace as
place metaphor is rampant, nor his conclusion that judicial use of the
metaphor has had pernicious consequences. Rather, I focus on the logical
steps that courts seem to be missing as they move from metaphor to
decision. Thus, in Part I, I explain why the cyberspace as place metaphor
is not a particularly good one. In Part II, I suggest some ways courts
might take account of these differences between the real world and the
Internet. In Part III, I observe that even if one accepts the place
metaphor in toto, it need not follow that everything in this new place must
be privately owned. Nor must it follow that private ownership rights
include complete rights of exclusion. My conclusion is somewhat more
optimistic than Hunter's. While acknowledging the dangers of the cyberspace
as place metaphor and the fact that courts have already started down the
wrong road, I suggest that courts and commentators who think seriously
about the nature of the Internet still have ample room to make reasoned
policy decisions. Though we may easily be misled by metaphor, we need not
be its slaves.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:25.114018,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:12:20.264000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/citation/,bjzw9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kbbtf/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/relationships/node/,kbbtf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde385b83f6901f3656297/,57bde385b83f6901f3656297,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bjzw9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bjzw9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bjzw9

to agreements, licensing practices or affirmative conduct involving the use
or disposition of the intellectual property rights or the products they
cover. But sometimes an antitrust claim centers on an intellectual property
owner's refusal to use or license an intellectual property right, perhaps
coupled with efforts to enforce the intellectual property right against
infringers. The allegation may be that the intellectual property right is
so essential to competition that it must be licensed across the board, or
that a refusal to license it to one particular party was discriminatory, or
that in context a refusal to license helped a monopolist to acquire or
maintain market power.

Claims based on a unilateral refusal to license - the subject of this
chapter - present important issues at the center of the tension between
antitrust and intellectual property. The antitrust and intellectual
property laws are not necessarily in conflict. For the most part they serve
complementary goals, though each must limit the scope of the other.
Unilateral refusal to license cases, however, cut to the heart of the
intellectual property owner's right to exclude others from practicing the
intellectual property. As such, efforts to invoke antitrust law in this
context deserve special scrutiny.

Section 2 reviews the basic principles relating to unilateral refusals to
license intellectual property rights. Section 3 discusses in detail the
various sets of circumstances in which antitrust plaintiffs argue for
exceptions to those basic rules. Section 4 distinguishes unilateral from
concerted and conditional refusals to deal.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:30.363747,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:10:23.838000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/citation/,8nbwt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hckf4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/relationships/node/,hckf4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde3119ad5a101f868d871/,57bde3119ad5a101f868d871,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8nbwt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8nbwt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8nbwt

However, because each new technology provides an important input to
subsequent innovation, the exclusive rights conferred by a patent may also
impose significant costs upon follow-on innovators. Optimal patent policy
should seek to maximize the patent incentive effect, while minimizing
burdens placed on future innovation by tailoring the scope of the patent to
the characteristics of each technological sector affected.

In the case of software, recent scholarship has illuminated the innovation
profile of the current industry. Software is characterized by incremental
innovation, relatively low development costs, and short, volatile product
life cycles. Interoperability and compatibility between complementary
products is a major concern, making technical transparency or reverse
engineering critical to product development. This suggests a need for
relatively narrow patents that are relatively easy to obtain, and subject
to the exceptions necessary to ensure interoperation and follow-on
development.

However, current software patent doctrine bears little relationship to this
industrial profile. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit has set an extremely lax standard of disclosure software patents,
resulting in patents scope unconstrained by doctrines of enablement and
written description. Recent changes that make patent law amenable to
software have produced a flood of new applications, allowing firms to adopt
a patent thicket strategy for licensing leverage. At the same time, Federal
Circuit case law suggests that a stringent standard for patent
non-obviousness will be applied to such patents, resulting in relatively
few valid software patents. Optimal software patent doctrine would
constrain scope to deal with patent thicket while lowering the
non-obviousness standard to validate more issued software patents.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:29.081297,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:08:27.461000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/citation/,cmv9r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fu7vn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/relationships/node/,fu7vn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde29d594d9001fdd0de84/,57bde29d594d9001fdd0de84,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cmv9r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cmv9r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cmv9r

equivalents decision in both the Federal Circuit and the district courts
during three periods - one before the Federal Circuit's 2000 Festo opinion,
one after that opinion but before the Supreme Court's 2002 opinion, and a
third after the Supreme Court's opinion. Two broader findings stand out.
First, the multiple changes in the doctrine of equivalents rules over the
last ten years have had surprisingly little effect on the actual outcome of
doctrine of equivalents cases, and even less effect on the subset of cases
dealing directly with prosecution history estoppel. Indeed, to the extent
there is any relationship it is an inverse one - patentees did better under
less patent-friendly rules. The attention everyone has paid to Festo as
changing the value of patent rights therefore seems to have been largely
wasted from a practical perspective.

The second finding is even more significant: the reason the Festo changes
had so little effect seems to be that the doctrine of equivalents was
already near death by the late 1990s. Even under the permissive doctrine of
equivalents rules in place before 2000, while everyone was focused on the
doctrine of equivalents, equivalents claims usually failed, most often on
summary judgment. That became even more true after 2000, and the Supreme
Court's 2002 decision didn't change the trend. In fact, district courts are
more likely to reject doctrine of equivalents claims today than ever
before.

This left us with a bit of a puzzle: what killed the doctrine of
equivalents in the 1990s? We suspected the answer was the growth of claim
construction Markman hearings after the Supreme Court's 1996 decision in
that case. Once courts were construing claims as a matter of law pre-trial,
and finding themselves in a position to resolve virtually all infringement
issues on summary judgment, they were naturally inclined to decide the
doctrine of equivalents issues too. And a court that has just rejected a
literal infringement argument - the only courts likely to spend much time
thinking about equivalents issues pre-trial - is unlikely to undo the work
of claim construction by sending the issue of infringement by equivalents
to the jury. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a fourth dataset,
including cases decided in the 1993 to 1995 timeframe. That data bears out
our hypothesis. The doctrine of equivalents was alive and well before
Markman, but has been in decline ever since.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:47.641486,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:06:36.198000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/citation/,pkh62,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ya4ek/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/relationships/node/,ya4ek,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde22d6c613b01ebd93606/,57bde22d6c613b01ebd93606,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkh62/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pkh62/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pkh62

name and likeness for commercial purposes. For years, courts have struggled
to make sense of two dimensions of this right - what it means to use a name
or likeness commercially, and what aspect of a person's likeness are
protected against appropriation. In the absence of any clear theoretical
foundation for the right of publicity, the meanings of these terms have
steadily swelled, to the point at which virtually any use that brings
financial benefit to someone by referencing an individual qualifies as a
violation of the right of publicity. At the same time, the courts have
developed no meaningful counterweight to this ever-expanding right.
Instead, they have created a few ad hoc exceptions in cases where the
sweeping logic of the right of publicity seems to lead to results they
consider unfair.

Two types of publicity claims have raised particular problems for the
courts. The first involves merchandising claims, in which individuals claim
violation of their publicity right not by the use of a name in advertising,
but by people who sell products that bear their name or likeness. Courts
have generally resolved these claims by making a distinction between news
or art, on the one hand, and merchandise, on the other - but as art and
information become increasingly commodified, this distinction - if it ever
made sense - has become ever harder to sustain. The second type of
problematic claim involves cases in which a use draws attention away from
the celebrity, or arguably sullies the celebrity's reputation in some way
that harms the overall value of her identity. Properly limited, such a
cause of action might have some theoretical appeal, but courts have applied
it in ways that exceed any plausible theoretical justification,
particularly when First Amendment considerations enter the fray.

Perhaps ironically, one root of the problems with these cases lies in the
very elusiveness of a theoretical justification for the right of publicity.
When the government can clearly identify a purpose in limiting speech,
courts have some basis on which to evaluate whether the speech limitation
lives up to that purpose. But because the right of publicity rests upon a
slough of sometimes sloppy rationalizations, courts have little way of
determining whether a particular speech limitation is necessary or even
appropriate in order to serve the law's normative goals. Instead, they
appear to assume that the sum of a set of inadequate justifications equals
far more than its parts, and allow right of publicity claims to run
roughshod over the speech interests of the public.

If the absence of a rationale has created the problem, then the answer lies
in identifying whether and when a right of publicity might serve a
legitimate government interest. Yet a review of the cases and literature
reveals that no one seems to be able to explain exactly why individuals
should have this right. A right of privacy can't justify it, for the right
of publicity has been applied in a wide range of situations that don't
implicate privacy at all. Some commentators have proposed a natural or
moral right of control over one's name or likeness, but there seems no
policy justification for giving such control, and the absence of such a
right in most of the world and indeed throughout most of U.S. history
should make us skeptical of claims based on some consensus moral belief.
The moral claim to own uses of one's name also seems inconsistent with the
absence of natural or moral rights justifications for other forms of
intellectual property.

Of late, and particularly in the merchandising and dilution-like cases,
courts and commentators have turned to the incentive-based rationale
underlying copyright law in search of both a justification for and
limitations on the right of publicity. Reasoning that the right of
publicity gives individuals the incentive to develop valuable personas,
courts reason that depriving them of the fruits of their labors will
interfere with those economic incentives. Some courts have even gone so far
as to create a fair use doctrine, importing from copyright law judicially
created limits on the enforcement of the right. This approach turns the
right of publicity into a new form of intellectual property, one based
explicitly on analogies to and justifications for real property.

We think copyright is the wrong analogy. In the United States, copyright
law is utilitarian. We grant copyrights in order to encourage the creation
of new works of authorship. There is no similar justification for the right
of publicity. Society doesn't need to encourage more celebrities, or more
marketing of celebrity image. Nor is there any evidence that, even if such
a result was desirable, a property-like right of publicity is well tailored
to that goal. Copyright's fair use doctrine, moreover, involves tradeoffs
between the interests of original creators and those who would like to make
transformative uses of their creative works; the right of publicity has no
similar tradeoff. Further, copyright's fair use doctrine is confusing to
the point of incoherence; it is hardly a model anyone would wish to
emulate. Finally, the analogy to copyright serves to obscure the important
free speech interests at stake in right of publicity cases. For better or
worse, copyright laws have gotten a free ride when it comes to the First
Amendment; the copyright analogy may prompt courts to mistakenly extend
that free ride to the right of publicity.

The Lanham Act is a far more appropriate analogy to the right of publicity.
The Lanham Act in its traditional form protects trademark owners against
commercial uses of a trademark by others that are likely to confuse
consumers, either as to the source of goods or as to the affiliation,
endorsement, or sponsorship of those goods by the trademark owner. The
right of publicity is designed at least in part to do the same thing for
celebrities. It prevents companies from using the name or likeness of an
individual in advertising or promotion to falsely suggest that the
individual has endorsed the advertised product. More recently, the Lanham
Act has been expanded to prevent dilution of famous trademarks by
commercial uses that draw attention away from the trademark owner, or throw
it into disrepute, even if they do not confuse. Dilution, too, has
analogies in the right of publicity. Uses of a celebrity's name or likeness
might in rare circumstances divert attention away from the celebrity or,
more likely, might tarnish the reputation of the celebrity by using her
name or likeness in a disreputable connection, even in the absence of
confusion or assumptions of endorsement. Finally, a few courts have
expanded trademark law to include a general right to control the
merchandising of goods bearing a trademark, even in the absence of
confusion or dilution. This merchandising right too has analogues in the
right of publicity. Indeed, the mutation of the right of publicity into a
virtually unlimited property right over any use of a name or likeness can
best be understood as the wholesale adoption of the putative trademark
merchandising right.

Reconceiving the right of publicity as an outgrowth of trademark law has
several significant benefits. First, it offers a helpful way to think about
the different sorts of claims made under the rubric of publicity. We have
considerable experience with each of these types of claims in trademark
law, and applying that knowledge can help us understand why we might (or
might not) want to prohibit particular uses, and when the law should forbid
them. Most importantly, looking at the right of publicity through the lens
of trademark law offers logical ways to limit the right of publicity.
Trademarks are not property rights in the traditional sense, though a few
commentators have argued that trademark owners should have property-like
rights over their marks. The idea of a merchandising right, while
recognized in a few cases and supported by trademark owners, is not
commonly used to decide trademark cases. It is also a problematic concept,
one that hardly deserves emulation. Trademark cases tend instead to be
decided either based on likelihood of confusion or on dilution grounds.
Both trademark infringement and dilution incorporate significant limiting
principles designed to balance the interests of society against the
interests of policy owners, and to accommodate First Amendment concerns.
These limits have not been incorporated into the right of publicity,
however. The result is a mutant version of trademark policy, including the
affirmative rights but virtually none of the defenses or limits of
trademark law.

A proper understanding of the right of publicity would draw more completely
on trademark principles, limiting the right to circumstances in which the
use of an individual's name or likeness is either likely to confuse
consumers or is likely to dilute the significance of a famous name.
Revising the right of publicity to conform to the rules we have worked out
in trademark cases will avoid some of the worst abuses of the right, limit
the conflict between the right of publicity and First Amendment principles,
and put the right on a more solid conceptual grounding.

In Part I, we describe the growth of the right of publicity from its narrow
privacy origins to a virtually unlimited, descendible, assignable property
right. Part I discusses two particular excesses that this trend has brought
about, and that are increasingly creating problems for the courts and the
public: the expanding merchandising right, and the dilution-like cause of
action. Part II discusses the existing efforts to explain the growth of the
right of publicity. Those explanations have generally focused on
incentive-based rationales akin to copyright law - rationales whose logic
breaks down in the right of publicity context. Part II goes on to explain
why copyright proves inadequate to justify or to delimit the right of
publicity, with particular reference to the merchandising and dilution-like
cases. In Part III, we offer a new explanation for the right of publicity,
one based in trademark principles. Part III shows how the right of
publicity has adopted some but not all of the rules of trademark law, and
how a more complete importation of trademark principles into publicity law
would solve many of the problems that plague the doctrine. Finally, in Part
IV we consider some objections and compare our approach to alternative
approaches for dealing with the problems of the publicity right.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:04.694337,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T18:04:17.242000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/citation/,r8pvh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6zezg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/relationships/node/,6zezg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bde1a26c613b01edd95334/,57bde1a26c613b01edd95334,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8pvh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r8pvh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r8pvh

information through convenient, identifiable symbols. In practice, however,
trademarks have increasingly been used to obstruct the flow of information
about competing products and services. In the online context, in
particular, some courts have recently allowed trademark holders to block
uses of their marks that would never have raised an eyebrow in a
brick-and-mortar setting - uses that increase, rather than diminish, the
flow of truthful, relevant information to consumers. These courts have
stretched trademark doctrine on more than one dimension, both by expanding
the concept of actionable ""confusion"" and by broadening the classes of
people who can face legal responsibility for that confusion. And they have
based their decisions not on the normative goals of trademark law, but on
unexplored instincts and tenuous presumptions about consumer expectations
and practices on the Internet. We argue that this expansionist trend in
Internet trademark cases threatens to undermine a central goal of the
