For D. H. Lawrence (1885 –1930), myth became one of the most important elements in both his fictional and non fictional works. Taking well-known examples, he reinterpreted them as an illustration of his own personal vision. This article is limited to a study of three major fictional works: The Rainbow, Women in Love and The Virgin and The Gypsy and attempts to analyse them in the light of the Genesis myth. It hinges on the hypothesis that Lawrence, by condemning orthodox religious beliefs, formulated his own creation myth: his regenesis.  He attempted to expose the false ideals of conventional society, which had for centuries destroyed man’s natural intuition, by a re-examination of the Genesis myth. By using an analytical approach, this article aims to answer several provocative questions. Firstly, how far did Lawrence succeed in undermining conventional authority? Secondly, how successful was he in formulating his philosophy of regenesis?

This is the main question of this paper. In reading Martin Heidegger’s Being and Time (1927), the readers construct a figure in their mind of a persona about whom all the philosophical reflections are discussed. Heidegger presents Dasein as a ‘particular being’ that characterizes all the features of human existence. Heidegger did not want to define and explain ‘being’, but he aimed at presenting a ‘sense of being’ in the form of characterizing the philosophical reflections he was presenting. After discussing how it can be claimed that Dasein can be considered a ‘fictional character’ in the absence of a ‘plot,’ the present article explains the main aspects through which a ‘fictional character’ is constructed, or figured out, in readers’ mind. It tries, also, to show how and why Heidegger resorts to this technique of fictional characterization in this highly influential philosophical book. The article specifies four main personality models, that help construct Dasein as a ‘fictional character’ in the reader’s mind. These personality models are: being-in-world, being-in-time, living-by-activity, and living-to-an-end. By ascribing such personality models to Dasein, Heidegger managed to present in his work a character that can be easily remembered all the time Being and Time is mentioned.",TRUE,FALSE,being|character|characterization|fiction|Heidegger,2018-07-02T10:59:29.503178,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-04T20:31:38.971094,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/citation/,5hxm8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kqz6r/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/relationships/node/,kqz6r,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59346d98594d90024fe8842d/,59346d98594d90024fe8842d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5hxm8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5hxm8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5hxm8

English has become the medium of science and technology. Therefore, it has dominance over other languages of the world. Technical terms and concepts are translated mainly from English to other languages such as the Arabic language. Because of the foreignness and unfamiliarity of these terms in Arabic, the Arabic Language Academyمجمع اللغة العربية[majma’ al-lughati al-arabiyah] has always endeavoured to coin native terms in order to domesticate and naturalizeforeign terminology into Arabic. To accomplish this goal, translation strategies, as well as Arabic word-formation techniques such as derivation and composition have been employed by the academy. Among Arabicization methods isoutright phonetic borrowing of the English term via transliteration into Arabic sounds and characters. Another form of borrowing is calque (loan translation). This translation and Arabicization method has also been used by the academy in its terminology work. The aim of this research is to identify strategies of translation and Arabicization used by the academy in its terminology work. Accordingly, a descriptive and comparative analysis of ten English scientific and technical terms with their translational and Arabicized equivalents were analyzed and discussed. These terms were translated and Arabicized by the Arabic Language Academy of Cairo (Cairo ALA), which adopted various translation and Arabicization approaches to introduce and assimilate these terms into Arabic. Translation methods included borrowing (loan word), loan translation (calque) and literal translation (word-for-word). Arabicization methods included outright phonetic borrowing, loan translation, derivation, and composition. Findings suggested that Cairo ALA has appropriately applied methods of translation, as well as techniques of Arabicization in its efforts to delimit the foreignness of English terms.

It then  focuses on implementing Toury’s view on translating metaphor and shows how many proverbs have preserved metaphor, alliteration, assonance and rhyme in the target language (TL), and how many proverbs have lost these stylistic devices in the TL.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|metaphor|phonic features|proverbs|translation,2018-07-02T10:59:29.254411,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-04T20:04:56.009260,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3rt6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3rt6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3rt6/citation/,u3rt6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3rt6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sg4me/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3rt6/relationships/node/,sg4me,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3rt6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5934673e594d90024fe8828a/,5934673e594d90024fe8828a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3rt6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3rt6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u3rt6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u3rt6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u3rt6

This struggle is established perfectly well through Lucy’s apparent resistance to the constraints primarily imposed on her race and gender at home by both her mother and the Eurocentric society on the one hand and the androcentric and racist society she encounters in diaspora on the other hand. Surprisingly enough, Lucy, who is chastened towards the end of the book, creates her rite of passage towards development and independence through her valiant efforts to overcome such confines at any cost. The aim of the present article is to analyse from a postcolonial perspective the protagonist’s quest for identity in diaspora, the obstacles she overcomes to do so and to what extent she is affected by her new culture. This is manifested through intertwining discussions of androcentrism, colonial and postcolonial rebellion with questions of identity, hybridity, diaspora and cultural displacement.",TRUE,FALSE,Androcentrism|diaspora|hybridity|migration|patriarchy,2018-07-02T10:59:29.221538,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-06-04T20:00:51.181418,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzd3e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzd3e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzd3e/citation/,vzd3e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzd3e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j3huc/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzd3e/relationships/node/,j3huc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzd3e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59346630b83f69024f6a9343/,59346630b83f69024f6a9343,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzd3e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzd3e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vzd3e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vzd3e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vzd3e
