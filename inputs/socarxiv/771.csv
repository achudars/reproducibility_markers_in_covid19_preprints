copying their ideas, but the power to control the use of their idea even by
those who independently develop a technology with no knowledge of the
patent or the patentee. In an important paper, Samson Vermont challenges
this received wisdom, arguing that independent invention should be a
defense to patent infringement, just as it would be in copyright or trade
secret cases.

Independent invention has much to recommend it. The most significant
problem facing the patent system today is the rise of so-called ""patent
trolls"" - entities who do not manufacture products or transfer technology,
but wait and assert patents against successful companies who independently
developed and manufactured the technology without knowledge of the patent.
An independent invention defense would eliminate the troll problem in one
fell swoop. Nonetheless, I have concerns. While I agree with Vermont that
we can learn a great deal from the fact of independent invention, I am not
yet persuaded that we can be sure that an independent invention defense
will have no undue effect on incentives. Complicating this difficult
empirical question is the likelihood that the effects of an independent
invention defense would be different in different industries. Further, an
independent invention defense will significantly change any market for
patent rights that might exist or be developing today.

In light of this, I suggest four steps we might take that take advantage of
Vermont's insights without moving all the way to an independent invention
system. First, we should change the definition of willful infringement to
exclude independent inventors. Second, we should adopt some form of a prior
user right. Third, we should give simultaneous invention greater credence
in determining whether inventions are obvious. Finally, we might consider
whether the defendant independently invented as a factor in deciding
whether to grant injunctive relief and the conditions to impose on such
relief.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:48.774173,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T22:13:55.258000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/citation/,pvsu7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xwg7p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/relationships/node/,xwg7p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be1c24594d9001fdd0e005/,57be1c24594d9001fdd0e005,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pvsu7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pvsu7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pvsu7

of the doctrine of equivalents in patent law. The doctrine of prosecution
history estoppel precludes a patent owner from claiming during litigation
to own ground given up during patent prosecution. Under the old rule,
called the ""flexible bar,"" estoppel was based on a multi-factor test and
would apply only if the patentee had no choice but to amend its claims in
the way it did. Festo replaced the flexible bar with an ""absolute bar,""
under which virtually any amendment to a patent precludes resort to the
doctrine of equivalents for that claim element.

The Supreme Court is now considering whether the flexible or absolute bar
is the right rule. We believe there is middle ground in this debate that
has been ignored with both parties. Whether prosecution history estoppel
applies to any given amendment should depend on the reasonably foreseeable
effect of that amendment. Normally, patentees will understand that they are
surrendering coverage by amending their patent claims, and so a rule
precluding them from reclaiming that ground makes sense. But in some cases
the absolute bar will produce unexpected and unintended results. We argue
that the application of estoppel should turn on whether the effect of a
change would be foreseeable to a reasonable patentee at the time of the
amendment. This ""foreseeable"" bar better balances the competing policies of
strong protection for pioneering inventors and notice to improvers who wish
to design around a patent.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:49.144487,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T22:12:22.079000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/citation/,pz3tj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/944zt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/relationships/node/,944zt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be1bc7594d9001fed0e067/,57be1bc7594d9001fed0e067,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pz3tj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pz3tj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pz3tj

suggested that it would be preferable to lower enforcement costs for

direct infringers quick and cheap, so that copyright owners would be more
inclined to pursue such direct infringers instead of suing innovators.
While enforcement costs are likely always to be too great to allow pursuit
of every infringer, lower costs would allow for enforcement against more

break the text of a claim into discrete elements or units of text
corresponding to the elements or units that comprise the claimed invention
- essentially, organizing the language of the claims into chunks or quanta
of text. Define an element narrowly - limit it to a single word, say - and
you will tend to narrow the resulting patent, because to prove infringement
the patentee must show that each word has a corresponding structure in the
accused device. By contrast, defining an element broadly tends to broaden
the patent, because it permits the text to read on a greater range of
accused devices.

For each discrete packet identified, the courts must determine the meaning
of the constituent words. They can assign those words definitions that
range from narrow, specific meanings to broad, general meanings. In
determining the meaning of terms within a particular element, judges
practicing patent claim interpretation are engaged in an exercise that to
some degree resembles the famous levels of abstraction test articulated by
Judge Learned Hand for analysis of infringement under copyright law's
idea/expression doctrine.

There are no hard and fast standards in the law by which to make the right
decision as to either the size of the textual element or the level of
abstraction at which it will be evaluated. Indeed, the indeterminacy is so
acute that courts generally don't acknowledge that they are even engaging
in either inquiry. They define an element almost arbitrarily, and even when
judges disagree as to the proper definition they can offer no principled
basis for doing so. The problem may be worse than a simple failure to
acknowledge subconscious decisions that affect the scope of a patent,
however. This indeterminacy may well be inherent in the process of mapping
words to things, as modern literary theorists suggest. While courts purport
to rely on the ordinary or plain meaning of the words of a patent claim,
there may simply be no such thing.

If we can't define the metes and bounds of the invention in any meaningful
way, we might instead start with the patentee's invention itself,
construing patent claims narrowly and in light of the actual invention when
the claim terms are ambiguous. Courts could then supplement this narrower
claim construction with a doctrine of equivalents analysis, which would
permit them to decide how broadly to apply the principle of the invention.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:06.028510,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T22:03:02.349000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/citation/,jn2yz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hkfbb/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/relationships/node/,hkfbb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be199c9ad5a101fb68d998/,57be199c9ad5a101fb68d998,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jn2yz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jn2yz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jn2yz

threat to obtain a permanent injunction greatly enhances the patent
holder's negotiating power, leading to royalty rates that exceed a
benchmark level based on the value of the patented technology and the
strength of the patent. John Golden, in his extensive comment on our paper,
claims: ""Lemley and Shapiro err when they claim to have proven that
'patentees whose inventions are only one component of a larger product are
systematically overcompensated.'"" However, the error is Golden's not ours.
When patentees systematically capture value they did not create from others
who did create it, they are being overcompensated by any reasonable
measure, including the standard economic models on which we relied. In Part
II, we briefly respond to his criticism of our empirical study of
court-awarded reasonable royalties. Finally, Golden also claims that our
recommendation to reduce the availability of permanent injunctions to
patent holders who have claims to reasonable royalties but not lost profits
remedy ""threatens to distort markets for innovation."" We strongly disagree.
It is patent holdup, which skews damages in ways more favorable to

non-exclusive, fifteen-factor “Georgia-Pacific” test now taken as the gold
standard for calculating reasonable royalty damages. Simply handing the
question of reasonable royalty to the jury, without more, is not a recipe
for precision in damages analysis. But the fifteen-factor test may actually
be worse, because it overloads the jury with factors to consider that may
be irrelevant, overlapping, or even contradictory. And because the jury’s
finding is the result of such a complex, multi-factor test, it is as a
practical matter almost entirely immune from scrutiny by either district or
appellate judges facing a deferential standard of review.

We suggest a structured approach to calculating reasonable royalties. Most
of the factors in the Georgia-Pacific test in fact boil down to three
fundamental questions: (1) what is the marginal contribution of the
patented invention over the prior art, (2) how many other inputs were
necessary to achieve that contribution, and what is their relative value,
and (3) is there some concrete evidence suggesting that the market has
chosen a number different than the product of (1) and (2). By structuring
the inquiry in this way, courts (or Congress) can not only simplify the
question for the jury, but enable district courts and the Federal Circuit
to easily review the factual basis for a jury award.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:07.263160,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T21:57:33.473000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/citation/,fju3q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7csbh/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/relationships/node/,7csbh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57be184eb83f6901f86563f2/,57be184eb83f6901f86563f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fju3q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fju3q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fju3q
