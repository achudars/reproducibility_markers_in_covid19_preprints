Originating first on Twitter in 2007, hashtags have spread to other platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. In addition to functioning as topic markers, hashtags have developed more complex linguistic functions. The ubiquity of this feature in the online medium, which now occupies a significant portion of our everyday communication is thus worthy of investigation. Although this topic has been researched in different disciplines, such as information diffusion, marketing, as well as sociology and public opinion, hashtags have not yet received enough attention from linguistic research. Using a sample of hashtags from a corpus of Instagram posts by Egyptian and Arab participants, this research thus aims to examine the characteristics of hashtags from a linguistic perspective, with particular focus on hashtags in the Arabic language. The study primarily seeks to determine the morpho-syntactic features of these recently emerging linguistic items according to the taxonomy proposed by Caleffi (2015). It also explores the pragmatic functions of hashtags based on Zappavigna’s (2015) view of hashtags as technologically discursive tools. The analysis points out that most of the hashtags in the data serve the experiential function and come as suffixes. The findings reveal both similarities and differences between English and Arabic hashtags.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-08-20T15:09:20.886917,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-20T15:09:10.272731,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3usp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3usp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3usp/citation/,a3usp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3usp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3usp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3usp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3dfbf7bacde8002f33bf87/,5f3dfbf7bacde8002f33bf87,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3usp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3usp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3usp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a3usp/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call6.6,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a3usp

However, the courses lack interaction, and learners do not have enough opportunities to contact tutors when they have problems. Therefore, the interactive web-based Test of English for International Communication tutoring course was developed in this study to promote interaction in online learning. This study investigates the effects of the course on students’ English grammar proficiency and explores students’ opinions on the course. The participants were 40 Thai students enrolling in the course. This research employed the mixed-methods approach. The effects of the instruction on grammar proficiency were assessed by pre- and post-tests. Students’ opinions were explored through reflective journals, questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews. The results show that students’ grammar proficiency significantly improved after taking the course. All students had a positive attitude towards the course. They perceived a high level of instructor-student interaction, leading to an increase in learning motivation and eagerness to complete the course. Although student-student interaction was in a slightly lower degree, the students had a positive impact on one another. Besides, considerable course flexibility facilitated active learning and increased students’ satisfaction. This course also encouraged autonomous learning as the students perceived a sense of responsibility for their study. Extrinsic incentives effectively motivated students to become more active and participate in activities.

This paper discusses the use of computer technologies in the acoustic analysis of speech prosody focused on the English television advertising discourse. The article aims to determine what the main prosodic characteristics of English advertising discourse are, and how they contribute to the maximum influence on the television audience. Therefore, the study relies upon the acoustic analysis using sound processing software WaveLab, Cool Edit Pro, SpectraLAB, Wasp, Sound Forge to ensure the reliability and validity of the obtained results. Moreover, the computer programs used in this research allowed us to measure the pronunciation accuracy and present results based on many experimental data, not only on the assumptions. Besides, the linguistic interpretation of the data of the perceptual and acoustic analysis of the English television advertising discourse prosody proves a strong correlation of these data. The obtained results indicate that detailed analysis of the quantitative prosodic characteristics of speech enables to get a clear picture of the prosodic organization of the English television advertising discourse.

An investigation into the effects of video-driven prompts on less-studied and more complex teaching speech acts, such as complaints, will significantly supplement the inconclusive results of pragmatic interventional studies in foreign language contexts. To this end, the present study aims to investigate the effects of metapragmatic instruction on English complaints through the implementation of video-driven prompts to raise Saudi female EFL students’ awareness of the pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic aspects associated with the production of appropriate and accurate target-like complaints during one academic semester. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to collect data from 62 English majors, assigned to an experimental group (n = 31) and a conventional group (n = 31), at Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia. To elicit the required data, a proficiency test and pre-/post-test written discourse completion tests (WDCT) were distributed among participants. The results of the post-test demonstrated significant improvement in participants’ pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic skills in the production of English complaints. The experimental group immensely outperformed the control group due to their exposure to authentic, contextualized video excerpts.

This study aimed to incorporate authentic online videos into students' English listening activities in college-level English classrooms in a private comprehensive university in southern Taiwan. Based on the research background and rationale, there were three main questions :(1) Is there a significant difference among students with different majors on the perceptions of the effectiveness of the listening activities on watching Technology Entertainment and Design Talks videos? (2) Is there a significant difference among students with the content familiarity in their learning with TED Talks videos? (3) What are the students' perceptions of practicing English listening with TED Talks videos? This research was conducted in a one-semester project to uncover 82 EFL learners’ self-reports of learning their online video materials. TED Talks videos and listening activities were utilized in this learning environment.

The authors extracted Facebook posts (text and embedded video links) in English from Buzzsumo between March 11, 2020, to April 31, 2020, using predetermined keywords. The first 50 posts pertaining to each keyword were extracted and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, Tukey test for post hoc analysis, and modified DISCERN score. A qualitative content analysis was then conducted to contextualize the data. 196 posts were included in the analysis, with 24,084,564 shares and 3,436,275 comments. Useful posts had higher interactions compared to misleading and irrelevant posts (p &lt; 0.05). The mean mDISCERN score for reliability was 3.2/5 for useful videos.

Experimental Evidence Demonstrates that Americans Want Workplace Democracy,"Much of the American labor force spends time in ""private governments"" over which they have little say during and beyond the work day. Do Americans prefer to work for businesses that look more like democracies or autocracies? We study this question using conjoint experimental techniques on a nationally representative sample of Americans. This design allows us to vary a large number of features of the workplace--especially their governance structures and the degree to which these structures allow for meaningful democratic decision-making. We hypothesize that workers should have a preference for democratic corporate governance structures such as employee ownership, co-determination, and the direct election of management. We find strong support that Americans have a preference for workplace democratization and that the magnitude is economically significant.

But is birth weight simply a proxy for environmental conditions in-utero, or do biological processes related to birth weight themselves play an important role in healthy development during the prenatal period? To examine this question, we utilize an underexplored source variation in birth weight that is largely orthogonal to prenatal environmental conditions: an individual’s genes. We leverage the recent identification of specific genetic variants associated with birth weight to construct polygenic scores in two longitudinal studies and empirically validate and unpack the molecular genetic correlates of birth weight. A 1 SD increase in the birth weight polygenic score is associated with a ~100 gram increase in birth weight; sibling comparisons show this association mostly represents the causal effect of genes. The magnitude of the relationship between polygenic score and birth weight is increased for children who spend longer in the womb and children born to mothers with high maternal body mass index. Finally, the birth weight polygenic score causally affects downstream social and cognitive outcomes, providing support for the hypothesis that birth weight itself is intimately related to healthy prenatal development.",TRUE,FALSE,Biodemography|Birth Weight|Fetal Origins|Life Course Development|Polygenic Score,2020-08-20T06:05:01.893587,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-20T06:04:41.372667,FALSE,NA,no,Data access can be requested via the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study website (https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/) and the Born in Bradford website (https://borninbradford.nhs.uk/).,,no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Sam Trejo,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j59q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j59q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j59q/citation/,7j59q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j59q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j59q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j59q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3da147bacde8002733e1e9/,5f3da147bacde8002733e1e9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j59q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j59q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j59q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7j59q/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7j59q

Racial cognition is implicated in this behavior, as white people use ignorance and apathy to overcome epistemic challenges that threaten white power, privilege, and wealth. Using Mueller’s (2020) Theory of Racial Ignorance (TRI), we show how these cognitive processes abide by an ends-based orientation—one whereby white people coordinate ‘anticipated futures’ to maintain the literal and psychic spoils of racism. Analyzing papers produced by white undergraduates following a project investigating systemic racism and family wealth transmission, we reveal how students’ practical takeaways betray this ends-based orientation, which remains resilient amidst critical learning.",TRUE,FALSE,antiracist pedagogy|color-blind racism|pragmatism|racial apathy|racial cognition|racial discourse|racial ideology|racial practice|racial praxis|social epistemology|white ignorance|whiteness,2020-08-20T06:07:06.187244,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-20T06:06:37.080718,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,Authors,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5frs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5frs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5frs/citation/,t5frs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5frs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5frs/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4juep/,4juep,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5frs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3da08dbacde8002733e0f2/,5f3da08dbacde8002733e0f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5frs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5frs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t5frs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t5frs/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t5frs
