To date, the effectiveness of RSPO certification for achieving its socioeconomic objectives remains uncertain. We evaluate the impact of certification on village-level well-being across Indonesia by applying counterfactual analysis to multi-dimensional government poverty data. We compare poverty across 36,311 villages between 2000 and 2018, tracking changes from before oil palm plantations were first established to several years after plantations were certified. Certification was associated with reduced poverty in villages with primarily market-based livelihoods, but not with those in which subsistence livelihoods were dominant before switching to oil palm. We highlight the importance of baseline village livelihood systems in shaping local impacts of agricultural certification, and assert that oil palm certification in certain village contexts may require additional resources to ensure certification’s socioeconomic objectives are realised.",TRUE,FALSE,agriculture|certification|human wellbeing|impact evaluation|multidimensional poverty|oil palm|Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil|RSPO|social welfare|Southeast Asia|spatial matching|sustainability standards,2020-01-20T17:36:44.006376,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-20T17:36:23.637597,NA,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/citation/,5qk67,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e25b2dfedceab017382d458/,5e25b2dfedceab017382d458,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5qk67/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5qk67/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5qk67,NA

However, changes in the strength of this association over historic time are largely unexamined in the United States.  Utilizing data from two independent national samples of adults collected 17 years apart (1995 and 2012), the current study examined changes in the strength of the association between childhood SED and adult health.  Childhood SED was scored as an aggregate index from measures of parent occupational prestige, childhood poverty exposure, and parent education.  Five measures of adult health were considered: BMI, waist circumference, chronic conditions, functional limitations, and self-rated health.  Results indicated that the association between childhood SED and all five health outcomes was significantly stronger in the 2012 sample than the 1995 sample, with the magnitude of the association being more than twice as large in the more recent sample for four out of five outcomes.  Findings persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race, marital status, and number of children.

A case study of problems in implementing evidence-based mental health policy.,"I examined the failure of the UK mental health framework policy NSF-9 to sustain the intended development in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in England from its inception in 2003. NSF-9 used Evidence-Based Policy/Practice (EBP) with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) derived from both research and expert practitioner advice. Adequate funding was provided, the workforce was engaged from the outset, and the KPIs were supported by dedicated data collection and dissemination systems, so failure was unexpected. I reviewed theories from the social sciences of Public Administration and Policy Research (PAPR) from the perspective of three questions. 
1. Are there applicable Public Administration Theories (PATs) that can account for this unexpected outcome?
2. Did the metrics used, or their delivery, have administrative or policy characteristics which undermined their expected impact?
3. Are there organisational factors, separate from EBP commitment, which could have jeopardised the NSF model?
I undertook a qualitative synthesis of the findings of several qualitative and quantitative datasets, using constant comparison between the datasets’ results and candidate PATs. I concluded that the currently accepted explanation; NSF-9’s failure was caused by inadequacies in culture and values was incomplete, as they resulted from weaknesses in the EBP model itself. When I applied relevant PATs to the data, it was clear NSF-9 had many faults as a policy within the NHS bureaucracy, which were not compensated within its design, and drove its eventual failure. I concluded that policy success without including evidence from PAPR is extremely uncertain, and is a continuing structural risk, as there is currently a disjunction between PAPR and Health Services Research.

Evidence relating to the security hypothesis,"Residential burglary imposes significant financial and emotional costs upon victims and society overall. Yet residential burglary in the US has declined by over 80 percent across the last four decades,  representing a major social phenomenon that remains largely unexplained. International research  indicates a need for investigation of the security hypothesis. Here, 50 years of burglary studies are examined chronologically. A consistent narrative emerges which indicates that household security, largely absent in the 1970s, improved gradually over time. Improvement occurred via three  mechanisms: the increased prevalence, quality, and routine use of security fixtures and fittings. In addition, crime displacement declined as fewer household presented easy crime opportunities, and burglars’ average age increased ( juveniles finding burglary increasingly difficult). The likelihood that 50 years of diverse evidence points in the same direction by chance, and without significant contrary evidence, seems remote. Hence the conclusion is  that  gradual household security improvements played a central role in the decline in residential burglary over time.

ABMs are useful in that they offer scientists the opportunity to model processes, phenomena, and study systems that may not be otherwise reproducible or testable. Replication or re-implementation studies of ABMs are, however, infrequently undertaken, and there are few examples within archaeology or other social sciences. This paper documents the process of a successful ABM replication study, as well as two additional modifications to the original model. Results corroborate the findings of the original geoarchaeological model and indicate that episodic geomorphic events significantly affect archaeological deposit formation and the inferences drawn from associated radiocarbon records. One revision of the model further demonstrates that episodic fluvial events can create highly varied radiocarbon distributions. The second modification illustrates that excavation data helps to fill in hiatuses in radiocarbon chronologies on depositional landforms, although there is no effect across landscapes subject to erosion. This successful replication exercise also illustrates the value of open access data and analyses in reproducing, testing, and expanding upon archaeological research and theory building.",TRUE,FALSE,agent-based modeling|geoarchaeology|radiocarbon dating|replication|simulation,2020-01-18T11:25:23.072989,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-18T11:25:01.065697,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/citation/,tckav,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2224f7edceab00c782f8fd/,5e2224f7edceab00c782f8fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tckav/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tckav/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tckav,https://doi.org/10.5334/jcaa.52

Implementing a field experiment in collaboration with a dual channel clothing retailer based in the United States, we automate a used clothing buy-back process, such that individuals engage with the retailer’s autonomous chatbot to describe the used clothes they wish to sell, obtain a cash offer, and (if they accept the offer) print a shipping label to finalize the transaction. We causally estimate the impact of chatbot anthropomorphism on transaction conversion by randomly exposing consumers to exogenously varied levels of chatbot anthropomorphism, operationalized by incorporating a random draw from a set of three anthropomorphic features: humor, communication delays and social presence. We provide evidence that, in this retail setting, anthropomorphism is beneficial for transaction outcomes, but that it also leads to significant increases in offer elasticity. We argue that the latter effect occurs because, as a chatbot becomes more human-like, consumers shift to a fairness evaluation or negotiating mindset. We also provide descriptive evidence suggesting that the benefits of anthropomorphism for transaction conversion may derive, at least in part, from consumers’ increased willingness to disclose personal information necessary to complete the transaction.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-18T11:21:23.791243,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-18T11:20:55.614452,NA,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/citation/,xud6z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2215faedceab00cf82d57d/,5e2215faedceab00cf82d57d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xud6z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xud6z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xud6z,NA

This article explores the potential of computational notebooks in urban analytics and planning, demonstrating their utility through a case study of OSMnx and its tutorials repository. OSMnx is a Python package for working with OpenStreetMap data and modeling, analyzing, and visualizing street networks anywhere in the world. Its official demos and tutorials are distributed as open-source Jupyter notebooks on GitHub. This article showcases this resource by documenting the repository and demonstrating OSMnx interactively through a synoptic tutorial adapted from the repository. It illustrates how to download urban data and model street networks for various study sites, compute network indicators, visualize street centrality, calculate routes, and work with other spatial data such as building footprints and points of interest. Computational notebooks help introduce methods to new users and help researchers reach broader audiences interested in learning from, adapting, and remixing their work. Due to their utility and versatility, the ongoing adoption of computational notebooks in urban planning, analytics, and related geocomputation disciplines should continue into the future.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|building footprints|centrality|civil engineering|coding|computation|computer science|geocomputation|GIS|github|jupyter|network science|notebook|openstreetmap|osmnx|pedagogy|programming|python|road network|routing|spatial analysis|street network|transportation|urban analytics|urban design|urban form|urban geography|urban informatics|urban morphology|urban planning|urban studies,2020-01-18T11:19:03.250525,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-18T11:18:36.772711,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dec|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Transportation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxtq3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxtq3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxtq3/citation/,dxtq3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxtq3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxtq3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxtq3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2205d7675e0e00b36b7aba/,5e2205d7675e0e00b36b7aba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxtq3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxtq3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxtq3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dxtq3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dxtq3,https://doi.org/10.18335/region.v6i3.278
