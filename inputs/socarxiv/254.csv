Throughout the past two decades, the United States has experienced consistent growth in the number of multigenerational households, seemingly correlated with cultural and economic changes across the country. According to one Census report, more than 4.3 million households, or roughly 5.6\% of all households in the United States, are multigenerational. Surprisingly, the political behavior of such a significant demographic subgroup has yet to be analyzed in any meaningful way. It is unknown if and how such households differ from traditional households with regard to political participation and engagement. Using data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series Current Population Survey (IPUMS-CPS) Voter Supplement for years 2000-2016 and Civic Engagement Supplement for the years of 2008-2011 and 2013, I am able to identify the individuals living in multigenerational households and assess their propensity to engage in a variety of political acts. Across a multitude of regression models and specifications of participation, I show that those living in multigenerational households participate at a significantly lower rate than those living in traditional households controlling for key demographics variables that have previously been shown to influence participation. Additionally, the panel structure of the IPUMS-CPS microdata creates the unique opportunity for a conditional differences-in-differences analysis with matching, so those who were not living in a multigenerational household at time $t$ but were in time $t+1$ can be compared to similar individuals who don't live in such a household in either time period. Those living in multigenerational households vote at a lower rate in presidential, midterm, and local elections, and are also less likely to engage in other forms of political engagement such as talking to family about politics, contacting an elected official, and being a part of organizations.",TRUE,FALSE,CPS|IPUMS|multigenerational|political participation|voting,2020-02-11T17:45:41.517390,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-11T17:45:21.384753,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,Mark Hill,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/citation/,2nsbh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e42d0b5a057ec006ab08d11/,5e42d0b5a057ec006ab08d11,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2nsbh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2nsbh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2nsbh,NA

Following the rise of the factory, the assembly line, and the office computer, some claim that we are now entering a fourth industrial revolution where autonomous systems are transforming the nature of work. What are the consequences of this transformation for intergenerational income mobility? Examining variation across 722 U.S. labor markets, we find that intergenerational persistence is higher in areas heavily exposed to industrial automation. These effects are rooted in childhood experiences and concentrated among men from disadvantaged homes. Unequal labor relations appear to exacerbate the association, while affordable access to college ameliorates it.

National tax policy under in-creasing financial transparency,"Why have OECD governments raised taxes on dividends at the shareholder level since 2008? Previous research points to the importance of budget deficits and voter demand for compensa-tory fairness in the aftermath of the financial crisis. We complement this literature by showing that the effect of domestic drivers of tax increases on capital income crucially depends on the level of financial transparency in a country’s investment network. Low financial transparency increases the risk of capital flight in response to a tax hike, whereas high financial transparency reduces this risk. Hence, governments facing fiscal pressure become more likely to raise taxes on capital income when transparency is high.

The Leech’s model (1983) consists of six maxims, and for Brown and Levinson (1987), consists of two major politeness strategies. It consists of two principles of politeness, where one of them is positive, and the other is negative politeness. This study aims at investigating politeness strategies, and politeness principle linguistically in two Suras from the Holy Quran, how politeness strategies and politeness maxims used within the Holy Quran. This study tries to investigate the image of the main characters in the most sacred book. A qualitative approach is employed to provide interpretations of selected verses. In this paper, we will discuss the politeness strategies, positive and negative politeness strategies, and politeness maxims. The study falls into two parts. It begins briefly to overview the theoretical framework underlying politeness, in particular discussing some definitions of politeness and politeness principle and its maxims, exploring the face theory and its strategies by Brown and Levinson, and how far these strategies affect polite style then, dealing with politeness maxims by Leech. The other part displays a practical application of what has presented theoretically. Also, the researcher examined the politeness strategies, and politeness maxims of two Suras (Yusuf and Al-Kahf). Moreover, the study observed that approximately the majority of negative politeness in two suras then positive politeness, and the last one is politeness maxims.",TRUE,FALSE,negative politeness. politeness|politeness maxims|positive politeness|the Holy Quran,2020-02-11T17:49:00.678568,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-11T17:48:44.078256,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dukfn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dukfn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dukfn/citation/,dukfn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dukfn/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dukfn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dukfn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e422ffca057ec002eb08c53/,5e422ffca057ec002eb08c53,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dukfn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dukfn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dukfn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dukfn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dukfn,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt2.6

Moreover, this study seeks to find whether the designed questionnaire enjoys the required validity and reliability.  As a case study, the sample of the experiment consists of seventy sophomores major in English at Mustansiriya University in Iraq. The researcher randomly divided the participants into control and experimental cohorts. The two groups submitted to the pretest and posttest. The participants of the study reported their responses to a six-statement designed questionnaire on suitable ways of improving the speaking skill. Statistical data have been collected based on the Likert Scale questionnaire, while the statistical values, such as mean, t-value, standard deviation, and chi-square,  have been employed. The normality, confirmatory,  validity, and reliability of the questionnaire were measured by using SPSS and LISREL programs. The research findings indicate that there is a significant difference in the speaking achievement between male and female participants who subjected to social media after receiving instructions via Skype devices. Based on these results, the impact of social media on students' achievements in speaking skills urges the need for a rethinking of the traditional method of teaching English. Further, educators should pay more attention to the process of employing social media applications in the educational domain.",TRUE,FALSE,questionnaire|Skype|social media|speaking skill,2020-02-11T17:49:41.040159,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-02-11T17:49:14.063345,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tqbx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tqbx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tqbx/citation/,8tqbx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tqbx/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tqbx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tqbx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e422f087610e10034ca50ec/,5e422f087610e10034ca50ec,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tqbx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tqbx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8tqbx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8tqbx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8tqbx,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/elt2.5
