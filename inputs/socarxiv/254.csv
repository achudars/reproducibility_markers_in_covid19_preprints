The paper illustrates how literature shifts colors to match the surrounding environment. Defoe's expresses the mode of thought of the Enlightenment that operates as a prelude to Western ethnocentricity, and Colonialism. It narrates the story of the unified conscious individual who has a solid faith in the efficiency of reason to understand objective reality. Such a perspective believes that language transparently represents an actual state of the world. Hence, Defoe's adapts Realism as the mode of representation. Tournier modernizes the classical text to fit into the postmodern cultural context, which doubts the certainty of knowledge, introduces the notion of the split subject, and believes that language mediates reality. Tournier tells of the anecdote of the Lacanian split subject whose experience alternate among the registers of the Symbolic, the Imaginary, and the Real. Therefore, anti-realism is Tournier's style of representation. It adapts figurative language as a variety of the signifier to demonstrate that language is an independent entity that constructs subjectivity, reality, and the text. To advocate humanism, and tolerance Tournier utilizes Lacanian insights of the split subject, the uncertainty of knowledge, and meaning.",TRUE,FALSE,anti-realism|Lacan|Robinson Crusoe|signifier|Tournier,2020-06-18T01:44:02.544813,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-18T01:43:40.420280,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8agse/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8agse/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8agse/citation/,8agse,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8agse/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8agse/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8agse/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edb1e5508aad300914402f6/,5edb1e5508aad300914402f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8agse/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8agse/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8agse/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8agse/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no2.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8agse

Research was conducted among forty students who studied the Poetry course (731478-2) during the first and second semesters of the academic year of 2019-2020 at the university. The study adopts a qualitative methodology with a survey as the primary tool to collect data.

Given that women’s empowerment is a vital part of the Saudi vision of 2030, the majority of the responses show positive attitudes towards studying feminist poetry.

Themes of money, hatred, love, assuming control over others are archetypal issues, which can be found in almost all dramas of the world. On these common grounds of the representations of characters in plays like those portrayed in Marlowe’s  The Jew of Malta (1633) and Shakespeare’s the Merchant of Venice (1600), these topics permeate the old and ancient dramas, of  the Greeks and Romans  and up to the present times. Such everlasting- themes have always been tackled on the world’s stage. The core issue in drama is whether the audience, watching any play in its time or at any age, enjoy the performance of the play. Marlowe’s Barabas or Shakespeare’s Shylock, for example, these characters have inspired many critics who always converge and diverge  about such characters. This article, however,  argues that one should first read these plays from definite perspectives like  convention, rhetoric, sources and the spirit of the age in order to understand the reality of some circumstances during that era, Elizabethan times. Another perspective, equally important, is the fact that the Jews, the Turks and Christians  were represented on the Elizabethan stage as objects of entertainment and instruction. Finally, one should read closely the Elizabethan  and  the reception of the plays above mentioned to understand them in the proper context.

Cultural Hybridity and Assimilation in The Namesake","This paper is a study of the cultural struggle and conflict survived by the protagonists in The Namesake (2003) by Jhumpa Lahiri as they move from their native land to America. It is an application of the theoretical concepts of hybridity and assimilation, as discussed in post-colonial criticism by critics such as Homi Bhabha. The researcher will discuss how the three main characters finally manage to develop new anti-monolithic models of cultural growth and exchange. As a result, they succeed in embracing a new culture while protecting their Bengali heritage. The novel depicts the life of an Indian couple (Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli) who settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1968. It describes the cultural challenges the heroine faces as she struggles to accommodate to a new Western society. Ashima clings tightly to her Bengali roots and identity, a fact which becomes apparent through the dilemma caused over naming their first baby. However, to survive the challenges of Massachusetts' society, Ashima welcomes its culture to a certain extent. Thus, she succeeds in overcoming feelings of loneliness and displacement. On the other hand, Ashoke's adjustment is less complicated. Although he copes with the new Western life faster, his respect for his native traditions is daily observed. His resentment of his children's attempt to give up their native identity is heartbreaking. Early in the novel, Gogol rejects symbols of his Indian culture, and later he repudiates his parents' style of life. Finally and after his father's death, Gogol's personal growth is associated not only with him welcoming his native culture, but also embracing both cultures in an excellent example of cultural hybridity.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-06-06T15:20:21.676653,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-06T15:19:58.403365,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx4fp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx4fp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx4fp/citation/,wx4fp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx4fp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx4fp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx4fp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edb173b8b542600988b9ff3/,5edb173b8b542600988b9ff3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx4fp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx4fp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wx4fp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wx4fp/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol4no2.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wx4fp

For archives, many institutions are on an unforgiving precipice of irrelevancy. The focus of this paper is not to iterate the necessity of archival theory but to examine the position of appraisal within a technologically-driven, internet society. Of significance to this evaluation is that organization, retrieval, and use of information have evolved, and users are central players in curation cycles. Also, of importance are those archives shifting to, and innovating, decentralized digital models - and thriving. A historical overview of both fields shows that appraisal falters in technical maturation and in response to changes in how society generates, captures, and retrieves information. There exist alternate paradigms for archival roles and appraisal, however, including recognizing that users derive the interpretation of information and that transdisciplinary archivists are vital. There are also developments in digital archives where access is the bedrock of the arrangement and description and the entire appraisal process.",TRUE,FALSE,archival process|archival science|archival theory|big data archives|community archives|COVID-19|data acquisitioin|data science|digital consumption|digital ecosystems|digital management|digital society|information consumption|information culture|internet society|SARS-CoV-2,2020-06-06T09:11:50.130873,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-06T09:11:17.677048,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Archival Science,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2befk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2befk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2befk/citation/,2befk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2befk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2befk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2befk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edaf25d08aad3009243c609/,5edaf25d08aad3009243c609,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2befk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2befk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2befk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2befk/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2befk

This regulation is related to physical distancing in all sectors and activities, including religious activities. To strengthen this policy, MUI and other Islamic organizations have made fatwa and official statement about how worships, especially those which are done in groups should be conducted during this pandemic. But efforts made by government and other organizations are not enough to ensure society that these regulations will not affect their religiousity. This paper is a literature review aimed to describe and analyze religious-related cases of COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. It includes MUI, Muhammadiyah, and Nahdlatul Ulama responses (fatwa and official statement) to this issue and public responses as well. It also compared this case to vaccine hesitancy case, due to similarities between these two cases. Both of these cases are dealing with religious dogma as it affects the policies’ effectivity.  Religious and community leaders are needed in this kind of cases in order to help government promote and educate people about health issues from religious perspectives. Moreover, some kinds of punishment made by government are needed to strengthen fatwas and rulings, as most of these religious opinions do not have legal enforcement.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|Indonesia|Islamic Organization|Pandemic|Public Health Response,2020-06-06T09:12:50.055570,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-06T09:12:24.856734,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzhy9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzhy9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzhy9/citation/,kzhy9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzhy9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzhy9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/792nt/,792nt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzhy9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edac85f8b5426008b8b4ad4/,5edac85f8b5426008b8b4ad4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzhy9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzhy9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kzhy9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kzhy9/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kzhy9

A Sociological and Theological analysis,"A consequence of Protestantism‟s aversion to monopolistic religious control is the sprouting and growth of unorganized religious establishment by enterprising individuals in Protestantism. This aversion is justified within the context of a reformed understanding of anthropology in a twofold manner. Firstly, that the corruption in human nature makes power concentrations dangerous. Secondly to prevent human beings from slacking in their duty that arise due to human weaknesses, Adam Smith‟s idea of competitive religious markets perform better than ones where there is monopolistic control. While Protestant theology insulates us from the dangers of power concentration and slothful duty that stem from weakness in human nature, it opens us out to new problems such as consumerism, commercialization and commodification of Christianity. With the dawn of the COVID crisis and most churches and ministries being forced to move online for broadcast and connectivity, the issues of commercialization and consumerism in religion will find new avenues for manifestation. The subject of this article is to extract wisdom and strategies to deal with the same from the early church which was placed in a very similar context of commercialization and commodification of religion.",TRUE,FALSE,commercialization of religion|consumerism of religion|Cybertheology|Online Church|protestant theology of church,2020-06-06T09:07:54.462554,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-06T09:07:19.709260,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cb6|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Christianity|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cb9|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Christian Denominations and Sects,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czybu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czybu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czybu/citation/,czybu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czybu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czybu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czybu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eda8efe8b542600808b2990/,5eda8efe8b542600808b2990,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czybu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czybu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/czybu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/czybu/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/czybu
