Historians have discussed whether the individual assemblies in the sixteenth and seventeenth century could be seen as a consistent institution, what constituencies were represented there, what role they played in the relations of the Tsar with his subjects, and if they were similar to the early modern assemblies elsewhere. The growing historiographic consensus does not see the early modern Russian assemblies as an institution. In the nineteenth–early twentieth century, history writing and myth-making integrated the zemskii sobor into the argumentations of both the opponents and the proponents of parliamentarism in Russia. The autocratic mythology, perpetuated by the Slavophiles in the second half of the nineteenth century, proved more coherent yet did not achieve the recognition from the Tsars. The democratic mythology was more heterogeneous and, despite occasionally fading to the background of the debates, lasted for some hundred years between the 1820s and the 1920s. Initially, the autocratic approach to the zemskii sobor was idealistic, but it became more practical at the summit of its popularity during the Revolution of 1905–1907, when the zemskii sobor was discussed by the government as a way to avoid bigger concessions. Regionalist approaches to Russia’s past and future became formative for the democratic mythology of the zemskii sobor, which persisted as part of the romantic nationalist imagery well into the Russian Civil War of 1918–1922. The zemskii sobor came to represent a Russian constituent assembly, destined to mend the post-imperial crisis. The two mythologies converged in the Priamur Zemskii Sobor, which assembled in Vladivostok in 1922 and became the first assembly to include the term into its official name.",TRUE,FALSE,Assembly of the Land|intellectual history|liberalism|nationalism|regionalism|Russia|Slavophiles|Zemskii Sobor|Zemsky Sobor|Земский собор,2019-11-22T19:21:03.482739,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-22T19:20:29.825144,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd1|Arts and Humanities|History|Intellectual History,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/citation/,bh8xg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd7e5cc215a8f000b4d1894/,5dd7e5cc215a8f000b4d1894,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bh8xg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bh8xg,NA

The game of football (soccer) provides a wealth of real world data with which to quantify managers' use of personal and social information in selecting team formations. I analyse a 5-year dataset of all games (n=9127, 2012-2017) in the five top European leagues (English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish La Liga, French Ligue 1 and Italian Serie A) to quantify the extent to which a manager's initial match formation is guided by their personal past use or success with that formation, or other managers' use or success with that formation. I focus in particular on the use of the 4231 formation, which was the dominant formation at the start of this period but showed a gradual decline in use over time. I find that, as predicted, a manager's choice of whether to use 4231 or not is influenced by both their recent use of 4231 (personal information) and the use of 4231 in the entire population of managers in that division (social information). Contrary to expectations, managers appeared to rely more on personal than social information, although this estimate was highly variable across managers and divisions. Serie A managers, in particular, showed a much stronger use of personal information, likely due to the rarity of 4231 in that division. Finally, there did not appear to be an adaptive tradeoff between social and personal information use, with the relative reliance on each failing to predict managerial success.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|football|social learning|sport,2019-11-22T19:19:01.696996,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-22T19:18:40.233966,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/citation/,wrx9f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pg9cz/,pg9cz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd7d64e6fc769000ad4ca76/,5dd7d64e6fc769000ad4ca76,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wrx9f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wrx9f,NA

In total, sixty-six proceedings are currently ongoing before the Court. The first application was made in 2013, the most recent in 2018. Russia has to respond to complaints by an expansive number of (members of) NGOs (such as Ecodefence, Levada Centre, North Caucasus Environmental Watch and Eco-Logica).
Remarking on the need to search for a responsive and viable mechanism of formal dispute resolution in the cross-border funding of NGOs context, L.H. Mayer (2018; in 'Globalization Without a Safety Net: The Challenge of Protecting Cross-Border Funding of NGOs', Minnesota Law Review, 102(3), p. 1265) has put forth to especially look at member state funded mechanisms such as regional human rights agreements. The ECHR likely holds the best option for a level-playing field in this context, although a fully tested outcome is lacking at the moment.
I look into comparative materials from the Court's decisional law related to Freedom of expression (Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights - ECHR), including the applicability of the freedom to receive and impart information.  I also sketch how some other Articles of the Convention are interlinked. The term “political activity” is central to the arguments raised. I discuss separately how that term could be treated in light of the case law of the ECtHR about Article 16 of the ECHR at the end of this paper.

We then implement this approach to score the strategic positioning of a large sample of startups in Crunchbase in relation to contemporaneous public companies.

Both standard economic labour theories and sociological theories presume that the effect of public childcare provision varies with mothers’ educational attainment. The analysis links county-level data on annual childcare ratios with individual-level data from the Socio-Economic Panel Study (2007-2016). To match mothers with similar characteristics in counties with childcare ratios above and below the annual median within East and West Germany, entropy balancing is applied.

Issues pertaining to the origin of human cooperation have, however, been characterized by a forager bias, the assumption being that they have a close link to our evolutionary past. In contrast little effort has been spent on documenting and explaining cooperative herding among nomadic pastoralists. As the Mongolian empire attest to nomadic pastoralists—in contrast to foragers—can form large-scale empires. In combination with the prevalence of small-scale cooperative herding groups, nomadic pastoral societies thus provide a fertile ground for expanding our understanding of the evolution of cooperation. In this paper I aim to extend our understanding of human cooperation through a comparison of the most well-known cooperative herding groups—namely the Mongolian khot ail and the Saami siida—and the most well-studied forager bands, namely the Hadza camp and Ache band.",TRUE,FALSE,bands|cooperation|group formation|herding groups|hunter-gatherers|nomads|review,2019-11-21T17:12:42.302027,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-21T17:12:28.383957,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c8bm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c8bm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c8bm/citation/,9c8bm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c8bm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c8bm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c8bm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd63a732fefe5000b7caecb/,5dd63a732fefe5000b7caecb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c8bm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c8bm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9c8bm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9c8bm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9c8bm,NA

In addition to overt forms of GBV, transgender individuals experience gender identity-related microaggressions: subtle, frequently-occurring aversive events that convey nonaffirmation or rejection of an individual’s gender identity. The degree to which a transgender individual is socially perceived as the gender with which they identify, sometimes referred to as passing, as well as sociodemographic factors such as annual income and race/ethnicity, have been previously linked with experiencing overt GBV. This study aimed to quantitatively assess whether self-rated degree of passing, age, annual income, and non-white race/ethnicity were associated with the frequency with which transgender individuals experience less overt identity-related victimisation in the form of gender nonaffirmation microaggressions. Among an age-diverse sample of U.S. adolescent and adult transgender persons (𝑛 = 224) who responded to 14 situational prompts of nonaffirmation microaggressions, adolescents experienced the highest average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions (M = 2.16, SD = 1.48). Factors significantly associated with increased average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions included lower degree of passing and lower income, while older age was associated with lower frequency of microaggressions.",TRUE,FALSE,microaggressions|minority stress|passing|sociodemographic|transgender,2019-11-21T17:11:41.363374,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-21T17:11:30.501766,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqc2e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqc2e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqc2e/citation/,aqc2e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqc2e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqc2e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqc2e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd5bfc11d56d2000cdff01c/,5dd5bfc11d56d2000cdff01c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqc2e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqc2e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aqc2e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aqc2e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aqc2e,NA

A number of outcomes associated with school belonging, including positive social relationships, perceptions of a fulfilling life, self-respect, optimism, and self-efficacy, are interlinked by the concept of socioemotional flourishing. This study aimed to assess the age-varying prevalence of and association between school belonging and flourishing among sexual or gender minority (SGM) and racial or ethnic minority (REM) students compared with non-minority students in the U.S. higher education setting. Data were drawn from a large national survey of U.S. college and university students ages 18–26, and were examined using varying-coefficient models to estimate the relation of school belonging and flourishing as a continuous function of age. SGM students (n = 6,718) had significantly lower belonging and flourishing than cisgender heterosexual students (n = 19,492) across all age points, and compared to white students (n= 16,444), REM students (n = 10,539) endorsed significantly lower belonging and flourishing at several age points. The association of belonging with flourishing was found to be significantly greater for SGM students than for cisgender heterosexual students across all ages, while age-varying associations for REM and white students were more complex. Findings of this study underline the unique importance and magnitude of the role of school belonging in socioemotional flourishing for SGM young adults, and highlight potential avenues for prevention of negative psychosocial and substance use outcomes among both SGM and REM college and university students.",TRUE,FALSE,flourishing|minority health|racial or ethnic minority|school belonging|sexual and gender minority,2019-11-21T17:11:01.893855,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-21T17:10:43.406932,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/citation/,utncb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd5be5b82d216000e530751/,5dd5be5b82d216000e530751,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/utncb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/utncb,NA
