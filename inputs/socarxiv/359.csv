The study used the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds test approach considering both the linear and non-linear assumptions for related time series data for the top CO2 emitter emerging countries in both the short run and long run. The results show that CO2 emissions have increased statistically significantly with increases in income and energy consumption in all four countries. While the relationship between CO2 emissions and population growth was found to be statistically significant for India and Brazil, it has been statistically insignificant for China and Indonesia in both the short run and long run. Also, empirical observations from the testing of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis imply that in the cases of Brazil, China and Indonesia, CO2 emissions will decrease over the time when income increases. So based on the EKC findings, it can be argued that these three countries should not take any actions or policies, which might have conservative impacts on income, in order to reduce their CO2 emissions. But in the case of India, where CO2 emissions and income were found to have a positive relationship, an increase in income over the time will not reduce CO2 emissions in the country.",TRUE,FALSE,Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL)|Brazil|China|CO2 emission|energy consumption|income|India|Indonesia|population growth,2019-06-13T10:34:29.491100,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13T10:34:05.710585,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hq6z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hq6z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hq6z/citation/,8hq6z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hq6z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6bnv5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hq6z/relationships/node/,6bnv5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hq6z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d02082235988f0018de29aa/,5d02082235988f0018de29aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hq6z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hq6z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hq6z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8hq6z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8hq6z,NA

The study is based on primary data collected in the months of July – October, 2012 through a questionnaire survey on 460 low income households from East Coast Economic Region (ECER) of the country. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database, based on cluster random sampling technique. The statistical estimation was done through two-stage formative path measurement model by using nonparametric bootstrap procedure under Smart PLS. This study finds that household food insecurity ECER – Malaysia is not only related to social and economic factors, but also statistically significantly linked to the direct and indirect impacts of climatic factors.

Racialized inequality persists because it is enacted moment to moment, context to context -- and it can be ended should those who currently perpetuate it commit themselves to playing a different role instead. This essay makes three core contributions: first, it highlights a disturbing parity between the people who are most rhetorically committed to ending racialized inequality and those who are most responsible for its persistence. Next, it explores the origin of this paradox – how it is that ostensibly antiracist intentions are transmuted into ‘benevolently racist’ actions. Finally, it presents an alternative approach to mitigating racialized inequality, one which more effectively challenges the self-oriented and extractive logics undergirding systemic racism: rather than expropriating blame to others, or else adopting introspective and psychologized approaches to fundamentally social problems, those sincerely committed to antiracism can take concrete steps in the real world – actions which require no legislation or coercion of naysayers, just a willingness to personally make sacrifices for the sake of racial justice.",TRUE,FALSE,elites|inequality|moral psychology|political economy|privilege|race|social justice|sociology,2019-06-13T10:29:49.926168,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13T10:29:32.349787,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",Musa al-Gharbi,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wd54z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wd54z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wd54z/citation/,wd54z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wd54z/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wd54z/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wd54z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d01ce27760f11001bfb9546/,5d01ce27760f11001bfb9546,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wd54z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wd54z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wd54z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wd54z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wd54z,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12544

The quasi-governmental Waterfront Toronto agency has partnered with the Alphabet subsidiary company Sidewalk Labs to plan and build out the neighborhood, essentially from the ground up, and embedded it with sophisticated technologies. The redevelopment plan details a digital layer made up of sensors that will collect and process locational information, tracking movement and usage patterns. Yet the project has been mired in controversy, mainly because of questions about data ownership and management. While there will be the amassing of an unfathomable amount of data, it is not clear who will control it and how it will be processed and used.  Critics of the project have pointed out that the potential value of the data is enormous and if a private company has exclusive domain over it, that company could decide to sell it at will. Securely storing citizen’s data is another problem. This paper provides a description of the popular newspaper accounts of the Waterfront Toronto Project.

Self-nudging applies insights from behavioral science in a way that is practicable and cost-effective but that sidesteps concerns about paternalism or manipulation. It has the potential to expand the scope of application of behavioral insights from the public to the personal sphere (e.g., homes, offices, families). It is a tool for reducing failures of self-control and enhancing personal autonomy; specifically, self-nudging can mean designing one’s proximate choice architecture to alleviate the effects of self-control problems, engaging in education to understand the nature and causes of self-control problems, and employing simple educational nudges to improve goal attainment in various domains. It can even mean self-paternalistic interventions such as winnowing down one’s choice set by, for instance, removing options. Policy makers could promote self-nudging by sharing knowledge about nudges and how they work.

Individuals’ increasing income, flourishing consumer culture, and security in social life as a cumulative force smooths the scope of modern global amenities to come in and grow up amid this changing society. Of them, new age digital communication is vital one. Digital media is encompassing people’s everyday life. Process of acquiring information has also changed remarkably: instead of searching to get one, people now struggle to look for reliable information due to ample information. Cyberspace becomes the cornucopia of fluid information that often baffles the surfers by providing distorted information. Bangladesh has been experiencing digital media-initiated disinformation from the beginning of 2010s. Interest groups are playing with digital disinformation conjoining religious sentiment. As a result, incidents of assault on religious minorities based on digital (dis)information have become frequent. Considering the importance of digital disinformation instigating communalism in Bangladesh, this study explores the nature of contemporary digital communalism and violence on religious minorities. It has been seen that beyond mere religious sentimentalism and sensationalism, historical and political along with several other factors significantly contribute to these atrocities.",TRUE,FALSE,communal violence|digital communalism|disinformation|minority|religion|social media,2019-06-12T18:32:50.555702,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-12T18:32:29.502185,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cac|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cae|Arts and Humanities|Religion|Islamic Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e17|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|International and Intercultural Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e19|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Ethnicity in Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8s6jd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8s6jd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8s6jd/citation/,8s6jd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8s6jd/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8s6jd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8s6jd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d00ae1dfea923001880e527/,5d00ae1dfea923001880e527,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8s6jd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8s6jd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8s6jd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8s6jd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8s6jd,NA

While these policies can increase the size of the electorate, they may also carry costs through changing electorate composition, by differentially enfranchising those who are highly sensitive to costs. Using new administrative data from South Africa and a difference-in-differences design, I show that a 15 year, large scale, expansion of access to voting stations increased national turnout by between 2.3 and 4.7 percentage points. In the context of a natural quasi-experiment, I then use 39,000 survey respondents geo-referenced to their nearest voting station to document that those of high socioeconomic status, and those who are older, are much more sensitive to electoral access than others. This may affect electorate composition in favor of those already  economically or politically powerful, who also happen to be more opposed to redistributive public policies and have particular partisan preferences.",TRUE,FALSE,Causal inference|Election administration|Observational data|Political inequality|South Africa|Turnout|Voting behavior|Voting costs,2019-06-12T03:50:44.442079,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-12T03:50:19.222591,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Daniel de Kadt,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z87k3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z87k3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z87k3/citation/,z87k3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z87k3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z87k3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z87k3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cffd56f2a575b00179fb1c4/,5cffd56f2a575b00179fb1c4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z87k3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z87k3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z87k3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z87k3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z87k3,NA
