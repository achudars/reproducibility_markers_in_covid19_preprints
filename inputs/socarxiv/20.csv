The ECB mandate provides no clear guidance for many of the ECB’s recent challenges, which include a sovereign bond market panic, technical limits to the efficacy of its tools, and questions concerning the environmental impact of its operations. For this reason, the ECB’s decisions suffer from democratic authorization gaps; it makes choices with far-reaching consequences for which there is no clear basis in the mandate. In this context, courts can either opt to accept choices made by the ECB, as the ECJ has mostly done, or, as the Bundesverfassungsgericht decided to do, itself weigh in on monetary policy. Neither approach, we argue, can improve the tenuous democratic legitimacy of the ECB in the absence of proper democratic guidance.

It is, however, unknown whether the ideal number of children, a key predictor of fertility behaviour, has also declined, either in parallel or prior to fertility decline. Finland is known for its supportive family policies, but is among those countries, which have experienced drastic and poorly understood fertility decline over the last decade. Using repeated cross-sectional survey data from the Finnish Family Barometers, we examined birth cohort changes in ideal number of children among men and women born in 1970–94. Our findings indicate that the ideal number of children was lower among more recent compared to earlier birth cohorts. This difference in fertility ideals was driven by larger proportions of those preferring to remain childless among the recent birth cohorts. This suggests that attitudes of Finns towards childbearing have changed and may contribute to recent fertility decline.",TRUE,FALSE,birth cohort changes|education|fertility|ideal number of children|parenthood status|partnership status,2021-05-01T14:08:06.869105,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-01T14:07:38.537024,FALSE,NA,no,The data used are available to registered users from the Finnish Social Science Data Archive (https://services.fsd.tuni.fi/catalogue/series/14?tab=studies&amp;lang=en).,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vtqm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vtqm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vtqm/citation/,7vtqm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vtqm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vtqm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vtqm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/608ad7ee19183d0066556fee/,608ad7ee19183d0066556fee,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vtqm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vtqm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vtqm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7vtqm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7vtqm,NA

By doing so we can validate both independent sources of data and provide more information than either dataset on its own. We estimate these time-varying indices with summary scores for each day from January 1st, 2020 to January 15th, 2021 for over 180 countries and six policy categories: social distancing policies, school-related policies, business-related policies, health monitoring policies, health resources policies and mask-related policies. We also estimate models that predict these indices with a range of social, public health, political and economic covariates. Our results show that business restrictions and social distancing restrictions are strongly associated with reduced general anxiety while school restrictions much less so. Furthermore, school restrictions are associated with higher rates of personal contact with people outside the home, higher levels of income inequality and bureaucratic corruption.

However, accounting for clusters is essential because individuals in social networks (e.g., social media) cannot oversee the whole network and have to restrict their interactions to local substructures. Roles that do not account for this cluster formation may lead to misinterpretations of the network’s dynamics and functions. This article proposes a theory of social roles in large social networks. We group roles detected in previous empirical studies into meta-roles and embed them along two dimensions, strategicness describing whether the person works towards a particular goal or not, and the type of strategy (selfish or group-oriented). We extend this framework by adding a cluster dimension describing to what extent a person’s interactions are embedded locally or globally in the network. We argue that empirical role analyses would benefit from our theory by systematically accounting for complex structures specific to the network perspective, generalising empirical findings beyond individual case studies, and understanding human interactions better.",TRUE,FALSE,cluster|communication network|role detection|social role|theory,2021-05-01T03:27:05.187305,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-01T03:26:52.469071,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Other Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkafb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkafb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkafb/citation/,xkafb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkafb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkafb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkafb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/608a8f846801ab004c2a4fb2/,608a8f846801ab004c2a4fb2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkafb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkafb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkafb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xkafb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xkafb,NA

This chapter considers potential downsides of pursuing current account surpluses over time, across economic sectors, and at the international level. It surveys work on export-led growth, neomercantilism, and import-substitution strategies in work by a range of economists in Post-Keynesian, structural development, and world-systems theories.

Focusing on one of those components, this paper addresses occupational segregation. I document high onset of work-limiting disabilities in occupations where many workers identify as non-Hispanic Black or as Hispanic. I then pivot to a causal question. Suppose we took a sample from the population and reassigned their occupations to be a function of education alone. To what degree would health disparities narrow for that sample? Using observational data, I estimate that the disparity between non-Hispanic Black and white workers would narrow by one-third. This estimate is credible because of adjustment for lagged measures of demographics, human capital, and health carried out under transparent causal assumptions. The result contributes to understanding about inequality and health by quantifying the contribution of occupational segregation to a disparity: if we took a sample and reassigned occupations, the disparity would narrow but would not disappear. The paper contributes to methodology by illustrating an approach to macro-level claims (how segregation affects a population disparity) that draws on explicitly causal micro-level analyses (potential outcomes for individuals) for which data are abundant.",TRUE,FALSE,causal inference|health disparities|occupational safety|quantitative methods,2021-04-28T18:08:43.613218,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-28T18:07:24.238363,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://cps.ipums.org/cps/,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9evk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9evk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9evk/citation/,x9evk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9evk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9evk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9evk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60899c8f467c79002ca31dee/,60899c8f467c79002ca31dee,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9evk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9evk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9evk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x9evk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x9evk,NA

We define independent as journals that are not affiliated with a commercial publisher, and Canadian as journals that have more than one third of their editorial boards at a Canadian institution. Earlier papers suggest that most independent, scholarly journals run primarily on volunteer labour, with little compensation (Edgar and Willinsky, 2010) or as Pooley (2019) suggests “[platinum OA journals] limp along, with estimable doggedness, but are often one devoted editor away from the digital graveyard”. As labour is the essential for the continued success of independent journals, understanding the depth (i.e. how many positions; how many hours per position), scope (i.e. which tasks are undertaken and who is responsible for them), and cost (monetary or non-monetary) of labour will be critical in understanding and ensuring these journals’ success, longevity, and sustainability. To investigate current practices, the authors distributed a survey to 488 Canadian journals meeting the inclusion criteria. The survey was composed of two sections: how labour is divided at a journal (i.e. how many positions are there, what are the responsibilities of these positions, and how many hours/week are dedicated to these positions) and compensation (i.e. does the journal provide monetary or non-monetary compensation to members of its editorial team, which positions receive compensation, and what is the source of these funds).
