It can be applied effectively in the teaching and learning process. This article examines the effect of applying whiteboard animation in project-based learning (PjBL) on English as a Foreign Llanguage (EFL) students’ English presentation skills, investigates whether the English presentation skills of EFL students who were taught by using whiteboard animation in PjBL differ significantly across creativity levels, and finds out whether there is interaction or not between the use of whiteboard animation and the students’ creativity levels on their English presentation skills. Fifty Indonesian vocational high school students from two intact classrooms were involved and randomly assigned to experimental and control groups by quasi-experimental design and factorial research design. The quantitative data were gathered from both groups through pre-test and post-test. The analysis showed that students who were taught through whiteboard animation in PjBL significantly outperformed those who were trained by using conventional media. It was also found that students’ creativity levels (little-c and mini-c) did not affect their English presentation skills. Then, there was no interaction between whiteboard animation in PjBL and students’ creativity levels on their English presentation skills.

The purpose of this paper is to review the literature concerning the strengths and weaknesses of blended learning as a technology-enhanced pedagogical tool that combines online and face-to-face instructional activities, on the development of English skills, inclusive of its use in the teaching of English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Furthermore, this article sheds new light on how blended learning allows the learner to become autonomous and engaged in the construction the knowledge, rather than acting as passive absorbers. It is expected that this paper will contribute to enhancing the body of knowledge that exists in the area of blended learning, especially as it applies to the issue of the acquisition of experience in English as a foreign language. It can be concluded that the use of blended learning has the potential to support EFL learning and maximize EFL learners’ opportunities to practice the English language freely at their convenience. There are issues which need to be addressed and, or resolved, such as ensuring that the library facilities are capable of delivering this type of approach, online materials are suitably supportive of the students needed to access them, and the design of blended learning approaches take account of the preferred learning methods of students, and the workload required to be successful.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-08-20T15:06:43.211062,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-20T15:05:33.951704,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjsmk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjsmk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjsmk/citation/,wjsmk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjsmk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjsmk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjsmk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3e029fbacde8002f33c544/,5f3e029fbacde8002f33c544,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjsmk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjsmk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjsmk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wjsmk/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call6.13,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wjsmk

Various approaches, methods, and techniques were tested by researches to improve the writing skills of learners with multiple issues in mastering the craft. Nevertheless, the standards of writing achievements among second language learners are remarkably frustrating. In Malaysia, teaching writing to the primary school pupils is one of the biggest concerns as pupils expected to compose  narratives  as assessment in the public primary education. Concerning this, this research aimed to measure the effectiveness of the flow chart to improve pupils' narrative writing and to investigate pupils’ achievement levels in each narrative writing component. Besides, it identifies the pedagogical strategies that lead to the scaffolding of narrative writing. Action research carried out with 12 intervention sessions in two cycles. Each Cycle involved three stages: planning, action, and reflection. A total of 25 Year Four  urban primary school pupils participated in this study. The researcher obtained the data via pre and posttest, analysis of pupils’ narrative writing, and classroom observations. The findings showed that there was a significant improvement in pupils’ posttest scores and narrative writing assessment components. This study is essential to improve narrative writing achievement and benefit teachers who teach narrative writing in primary and secondary schools to enhance pupils’ performances. Studies in the future should include pupils from rural area schools with low proficiency levels to compare the findings in employing flow chart in narrative writing.",TRUE,FALSE,English as Second Language|flow chart|narrative|scaffolding|writing assessments,2020-08-20T15:08:34.735194,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-20T15:08:06.233217,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvs2t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvs2t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvs2t/citation/,nvs2t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvs2t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvs2t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvs2t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3dfea8746a81003a1a1cd0/,5f3dfea8746a81003a1a1cd0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvs2t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvs2t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvs2t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nvs2t/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call6.9,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nvs2t

The study is triggered by identified needs in literature and the empirical needs of postgraduate TESOL students in the study context. In-depth semi-structured focus group interviews were used to collect the data. The data analysis revealed that the difficulties they encounter are mainly filled into one of the following categories: language skills, academic writing skills, and source managing skills. At the same time, the study probed an intervention trial of using Google Classroom. Having explored students’ perceptions regarding the use of Google Classroom and its effect on their academic writing revealed the growing understanding of digital tools' impact on encouraging independent learning and critical awareness that contribute to the enhancement of academic writing. However, with the advancements in technology, students seek support from online resources, but they still think that feedback from lecturers and supervisors is a crucial source of support; therefore, scaffolded feedback is recommended.",TRUE,FALSE,academic writing|Google classroom|postgraduate|Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages(TESOL),2020-08-20T15:09:03.124737,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-20T15:08:20.763279,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gr4t7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gr4t7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gr4t7/citation/,gr4t7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gr4t7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gr4t7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gr4t7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3dfdcfbacde8002e33be39/,5f3dfdcfbacde8002e33be39,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gr4t7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gr4t7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gr4t7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gr4t7/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call6.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gr4t7

Recent literature in applied linguistics and other fields has denounced the existence of some conventions and “rules” that govern a given research writing. That is, using a concise, clear and error-free language is demanded in order to increase accessibility and ease of understanding. With the aid of textual descriptive analysis, this paper attempts to review the most common linguistic reasons behind papers’ rejection. Eight papers of Ph.D. computer science students were collected and analyzed qualitatively in order to diagnose the main problems and challenges Ph.D. students  face while writing for scholarly publication. Other than other linguistic lacunes, it is found out that the authors had problems mainly with using the right tone, choosing the correct words and the adequate tense use. Indeed, the results of this study are supposed to be of some use to writers who want to know what writing  conventions, if there are any, are adequate for paper publication. Finally, some recommendations related to students’ problems in writing for scholarly publication are made.",TRUE,FALSE,journal publication|linguistic conventions|revisions|Scientific writing,2020-08-20T15:09:20.767329,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-20T15:08:39.975592,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf53b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf53b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf53b/citation/,uf53b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf53b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf53b/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf53b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3dfcc5bacde8003333c0b6/,5f3dfcc5bacde8003333c0b6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf53b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf53b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uf53b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uf53b/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call6.7,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uf53b
