However, it neglects the large share of skilled workers who benefit from limited but steady economic improvements in the knowledge economy. This paper studies how workplace digitalization affects political preferences among the entire active labor force by combining individual-level panel data from the United Kingdom with industry-level data on ICT capital stocks between 1997-2017. We first demonstrate that digitalization was economically beneficial for workers with middle and high levels of education. We then show that growth in digitalization increased support for the Conservative Party, the incumbent party, and voter turnout among beneficiaries of economic change.

A central question in the current public debate on work and pay is whether workers in crucial occupations have been sufficiently remunerated for their work over the past years. Using a combination of the Dutch labor force survey and register data during the period 2006-2019, we find that the wages of workers in crucial occupations have on average improved over time relative to the wages of workers in other occupations, although this development has stalled in recent years. At the same time, workers in crucial occupations earn less relative to comparable workers in other occupations within several industries, while they often earn more within major occupational groups. The analysis also reveals substantial heterogeneity in wage gaps and their trends across industries.

About three-quarters of Americans report following all the recommended practices. But there is an elephant in the room: Overnighting – staying overnight at someone else’s home or having them stay overnight at your place -- is rarely mentioned publicly. But we find that overnighting is widespread throughout the epidemic thus far. In the past month, over half American adults had at least one overnight guest and about the same number (but not always the same people) spent at least one night at somebody else's home. The consequences are striking:  People who overnight are more than twice as likely to report having had COVID-19. Who overnights? Overnighting is much more common among young adults (over 60% for those 25-34) than among their seniors (dipping below 40% for those age 65 and over). Moreover, risk seekers  overnight much more than otherwise-similar risk-averse peers. Data: International Social Science Survey, Round 21, Cohorts 1-7, collected April –September 2020, N=9,474.

On the one hand, it is argued that drug users—and the drug markets in which they interact—may have become the incidental targets of law enforcement as police seek to enforce social distancing regulations by focusing their efforts on street-level pedestrian activity or open-air gatherings. On the other, interstate border closures and restrictions on person and freight traffic are thought to have interrupted illicit drug supply chains, temporarily reducing or displacing market activity at the street level and thus reducing police detections of drug users. In this study, we extend current analyses of crime during the COVID-19 pandemic to explore how the rate of police detection for drug possession and other drug-related offences has changed. Using Queensland crime data, we use Auto-Regressive and Moving Average (ARIMA) time series modelling techniques to explore historical trends and their dynamic forecasts. We then compare actual offence rates for March through June to identify any statistically significant changes. Importantly, we do not expect the impact of COVID-19 regulations to be universal, mostly because of the significant heterogeneity in local drug market dynamics that has elsewhere been documented.

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have been particularly vulnerable to the effects of the disease (Breevoort et al., 2020; Dahab et al., 2020; Elhadi, et al., 2020; Loayza and Pennings, 2020). Yet, LMIC regions have different approaches to disease response, control and monitoring. For instance, while Africa centralizes these roles in the Africa Centres for Disease Control (Africa CDC) (Wadvalla, 2020), Latin American countries lack a common health administration, making them more susceptible to complications due to poverty, comorbidity and political dynamics (Pablos-Mendez et al., 2020).

Traditional and social media have been important to disseminate information related to disease containment and treatment (Basch et al, 2020; Hopman et al., 2020). Yet, these tools have also served to spread misinformation, conspiracy theories and “miracle cures” for COVID-19 (Malinverni and Brigagão 2020; Moreno-Castro, et al., 2020; Oliveira et al., 2020; Pereira et al., 2020). In Latin America, there are several instances in which media trends have shaped policy and resulted in dangerous interventions to fight the pandemic (Oliveira et al., 2020). These have included the administration of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin (Mega, 2020), as well as the use of untested convalescent plasma as therapy for COVID-19 (Ferreira and Mostajo-Radji, 2020).

	While the world was horrified by President Donald Trump’s suggestion of drinking household disinfectants to prevent COVID-19, less has been mentioned about the extensive use of chlorine dioxide as treatment in Latin America.  Chlorine dioxide is a disinfectant commonly used to clean medical equipment and treat residual waters (Smith et al., 2001).  At high concentrations and non-physiological pH, chlorine dioxide effectively inhibits microbial and viral activity (Hauchman et al., 1986; Zoffoli et al., 2005). Exposure to high doses of chlorine dioxide has been shown to cause thyroid suppression, DNA damage and neurotoxicity in several animal models (Abdel-Rahman et al., 1984; Bercz et al., 1982; Harrington et al., 1986; Orme et al., 1985; Toth et al, 1990). It is therefore understood that chlorine dioxide is not safe for human consumption. 

At the global scale, the dissemination of pseudoscience and post-truth phenomena is often associated with income inequalities (Rijs and Fenter, 2020). Interestingly, however, while Latin American countries often have similar levels of inequality, the use of chlorine dioxide as COVID-19 treatment varied significantly across countries (Table 1). In this opinion article, I use chlorine dioxide consumption to further dissect the contribution of additional variables to pseudoscience dissemination, including scientific literacy and the democratic state of internal politics.",TRUE,FALSE,Bolivia|chlorine dioxide|COVID-19|Latin American politics,2020-10-29T01:54:22.180883,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-29T01:53:56.167154,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9ehf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9ehf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9ehf/citation/,u9ehf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9ehf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9ehf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9ehf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f989eca1017210293a41f83/,5f989eca1017210293a41f83,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9ehf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9ehf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9ehf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u9ehf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u9ehf

As LGB individuals report more family rejection and a lack of family support, our study investigates the role of family support as a potential determinant of LGB sleep problems. Given the importance of sleep on mental and physical health, study results may help shed light on persistent health disparities across sexual orientations. 
Methods: Our sample included 1,703 LGB individuals from the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Mixed-effect logistic regressions were used to estimate the effect of family support (measured at waves 2 and 5) on the development of sleep problems after 24 months (measured at waves 4 and 7) while controlling for potential confounders. Sleep problems were measured using a modified Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
Results: Family support was independently associated with all sleep problems in our study after 24-months: 1 SD increase in family support was associated with reduced odds of sleep dysfunction (OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.85, 0.96), short sleep duration (OR 0.85, 95%CI 0.78, 0.93), and poor sleep quality (OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.84, 0.98).

This study aimed to determine whether crime patterns in Mexico City changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test whether any changes observed were associated with the disruption of routine activities.

**Method.**
The first objective was assessed by comparing the observed incidence of crime after the COVID-19 pandemic was detected in the country with that expected based on ARIMA forecasts based on the pre-pandemic trends. The second objective was assessed by examining the association between crime incidence and the number of passengers on public transport using regressions with ARIMA errors. 

**Results.**
Results indicated that most crime categories decreased significantly after the pandemic was detected in the country or after a national lockdown was instituted. Furthermore, the study found that most of the declines observed were associated with the reductions seen in public transport passenger numbers. However, the declines predicted by the changes in mobility were not always consistent nor as large as those observed. 

**Conclusion.**
The findings contribute to the global evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 on crime and propose a robust method to explictily test whether the changes observed are associated with changes in routine activities.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-10-27T12:11:47.732080,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-27T12:09:04.205238,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4K9DS,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3GF67,prereg_designs,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/citation/,3jfwu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4k9ds/,4k9ds,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f980a4287b7df025a3b349d/,5f980a4287b7df025a3b349d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3jfwu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3jfwu

Testing the effect of ethnic appearance on citizen perceptions of the police,"Ethnic minority officers continue to be underrepresented across UK police forces. Further, some ethnic minority groups consistently report lower levels of confidence in police compared to their White British counterparts. Although there is consensus that a more ethnically representative police service is a good idea, there is limited evidence in the UK on how the public perceives officers of different ethnic appearance, and how this relates to trust, confidence and legitimacy. This paper presents findings from an online experiment (n=260) exploring how ethnic appearance affects perceptions of police. Our findings offer rare empirical support for a more ethnically representative police force. First, across respondents, we found that Black officers were perceived significantly more favourably than White or Asian officers. Second, we found that Black respondents had more negative responses to White officers, yet there was little evidence that Black officers elicited more negative reactions from White or Asian respondents. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.",TRUE,FALSE,affect|ethnic representation|police diversity|policing|trust,2020-10-27T12:14:21.798806,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-27T12:10:03.912517,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,available,NA,https://osf.io/mh8ag,prereg_both,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/citation/,yzspk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f97f34887b7df02593af95d/,5f97f34887b7df02593af95d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yzspk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yzspk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yzspk
