We find that the propulsive power of Britain’s public schools has diminished significantly over time. This is driven in part by the wane of military and religious elites, and the rise of women in the labor force. However, the most dramatic declines followed key educational reforms that increased access to the credentials needed to access elite trajectories, while also standardizing and differentiating them. Notwithstanding these changes, public schools remain extraordinarily powerful channels of elite formation. Even today, the alumni of the nine Clarendon schools are 94 times more likely to reach the British elite than are those who attended any other school. Alumni of elite schools also retain a striking capacity to enter the elite even without passing through other prestigious institutions, such as Oxford, Cambridge, or private members clubs.

In this paper, I question how representations of tourist destinations color and are colored by development. Presenting the results of ethnographic fieldwork conducted on the southern Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, I find that the authenticity of portrayals of place is important not for its veracity, but for the social work it performs. Authenticity is not merely socially constructed but expressive of social relations which value people and places. Tourist perceptions of the caribe sur as genuinely underdeveloped—gauged by an analysis of photos and guidebooks as well as surveys—produce an approach to resource use within the community that is limiting. Because the value of the place is its underdevelopment, development itself constrains the possibility of sustaining further growth. Ultimately, reading development via place can be a guide for critically appreciating contemporary patterns of tourism and sustainable development in the caribe sur and elsewhere.",TRUE,FALSE,authenticity|Costa Rica|place|sustainable development|tourism,2018-07-02T11:19:43.179090,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-28T17:51:58.298562,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/citation/,2ha5v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kyw9f/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/relationships/node/,kyw9f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f4c2d7594d90026cd6848d/,59f4c2d7594d90026cd6848d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2ha5v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2ha5v/,https://doi.org/10.1080/14616688.2012.699090,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2ha5v

Non-profit, consumer, and government advocates are working to expand access to locally-produced foods as a way of addressing major social and ecological issues. Some activists, however, suggest that farms “scaling-up” production and distribution may lose sight of the movement's aims by circumventing a direct exchange between growing and consumer and by delivering “local” shares long distances. I argue that in order to answer whether scaling-up is misguided, we first have to understand how farms come to scale differently. I describe the varied practices that three community supported agriculture (CSA) farms in the Midwest perform in order to give their products market value as embedded in a specific socio-ecological context. I focus on three key moments of CSA that advocates are concerned about in scaling-up: 1) the employment of different kinds of labor; 2) operating within the seasons; 3) the management of sharer expectations about produce quantity and quality. As what I call commodity practice, farm decisions about these factors produce differently scaled local food commodities. These different practices are not necessarily incongruent with the aims of the movement. My main point in this approach is to advance an awareness of hybridity in local food institutions. As CSAs and other institutions like food hubs grow and evolve, a look at commodity practices can shed light on and confound some of the apparent contradictions in scaling-up.",TRUE,FALSE,commodification|Community Supported Agriculture|local food|Midwest US|scale,2018-07-02T11:19:43.144301,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-28T17:47:01.728209,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/citation/,jh8ac,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6w79f/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/relationships/node/,6w79f,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f4c190594d90026bd68440/,59f4c190594d90026bd68440,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jh8ac/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jh8ac/,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2014.01.001,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jh8ac

Moore &amp; Robert E. Roth

HazMatMapper is an online and interactive geographic visualization tool designed to facilitate exploration of transnational flows of hazardous waste in North America (http://geography.wisc. edu/hazardouswaste/map/). While conventional narratives suggest that wealthier countries such as Canada and the United States (US) export waste to poorer countries like Mexico, little is known about how waste trading may affect specific sites within any of the three countries. To move beyond anecdotal discussions and national aggregates, we assembled a novel geographic dataset describing transnational hazardous waste shipments from 2007 to 2012 through two Freedom of Information Act requests for documents held by the US Environmental Protection Agency. While not yet detailing all of the transnational hazardous waste trade in North America, HazMatMapper supports multiscale and site-specific visual exploration of US imports of hazardous waste from Canada and Mexico. It thus enables academic researchers, waste regulators, and the general public to generate hypotheses on regional clustering, transnational corporate structuring, and environmental justice concerns, as well as to understand the limitations of existing regulatory data collection itself. Here, we discuss the dataset and design process behind HazMatMapper and demonstrate its utility for understanding the transnational hazardous waste trade.

Geographers of technology illustrate software code’s contexts, effects, and agencies as it shapes urban space and everyday life, but the consequences of code for nature remain understudied. Political ecologists have critiqued remote sensing and GIS-based conservation projects, but have not engaged more broadly with the role of software in the contested production, circulation, and application of ecological knowledge. Yet, around the world, data analytics firms and conservation nonprofits argue for optimizing environmental management through faster and bigger data collection and new techniques of data manipulation and visualization. I present a case study from the US state of Oregon illustrating how conservationists and environmental regulators employ computer programming to plan markets in which entrepreneurs restore stream and wetland ecosystem services to earn offset credits. In these markets, code-executed algorithms constituting spreadsheets, web maps, and GIS utilities generate, relate, and make sense of the data that defines credit commodities. I argue that code tends toward three effects: producing a landscape defined by wetlands' modeled value; performing social relations associated with nature’s neoliberalization and financialization; legitimating these moves. Although emphasis on the performativity of code and other technological objects is warranted, the contexts in which these are authored, deployed, and evaluated should remain central to understanding environmental governance. This is to caution against seeing technology as reducing nature and society to state or capitalist rationalities and to hesitate to differentiate prima facie code’s work on space and on nature. I call for bridging political ecology and geographies of technology in ways that can explain how code is generative of environmental knowledge, change, and conflict.

A central question for the transition in Estonia is whether wage differentials will begin to reflect real differences in human capital and sectorial shifts in production. Thus, wage determinants in Estonia are examined during the early stages of its transition toward a market economy. In addition, wage determinants are tested to determine if there are any differences between the state and non-state sectors as well as whether wages are higher in the non-state sector even after controlling for selection bias.

The findings are that while being male positively affects wages in both sectors, being Russian positively affects wages only in the private sector.

This paper identifies functions of the quotative markers to and tte in spoken Japanese and examines the distinct distribution of each particle. The paper recognizes three related functions: marking direct or indirect quotation, marking evidentiality, and hedging. These uses are grouped together under the heading animating functions. In addition, the paper shows that to and tte display discrete distribution. Contrary to prior understanding, the particles are not identical in function. More than eighty-five percent to tokens are followed by a verb that indicates thought, while a similar proportion of tte tokens are followed by verbs indicating verbal communication.",TRUE,FALSE,evidentiality|hedges|indirect quotation|particles|quotative markers|reported speech,2018-07-02T11:19:42.273519,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-28T00:53:08.126512,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e04|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Morphology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e07|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Language Description and Documentation,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubpnj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubpnj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubpnj/citation/,ubpnj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubpnj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tn7u9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubpnj/relationships/node/,tn7u9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubpnj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f3d2d4b83f69026be1ea64/,59f3d2d4b83f69026be1ea64,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubpnj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubpnj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubpnj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ubpnj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ubpnj

Nilep, Chad. 2015. Ideologies of Language at Hippo Family Club. Pragmatics 25, 2: 205-227.

Ethnographic study of Hippo Family Club, a foreign language learning club in Japan with chapters elsewhere, reveals a critique of foreign language teaching in Japanese schools and in the commercial English conversation industry. Club members contrast their own learning methods, which they view as “natural language acquisition”, with the formal study of grammar, which they see as uninteresting and ineffective. Rather than evaluating either the Hippo approach to learning or the teaching methods they criticize, however, this paper considers the ways of thinking about language that club members come to share. Members view the club as a transnational organization that transcends the boundaries of the nation-state. Language learning connects the club members to a cosmopolitan world beyond the club, even before they interact with speakers of the languages they are learning. The analysis of club members’ ideologies of language and language learning illuminates not only the pragmatics of language use, but practices and outcomes of socialization and shared social structures.",TRUE,FALSE,education|Japan|language ideology|second language acquisition,2018-07-02T11:19:42.242134,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-28T00:42:19.086269,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d66|Education|Bilingual, Multilingual, and Multicultural Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Linguistic Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e02|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e05|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Semantics and Pragmatics",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/citation/,q6kz5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vx347/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/relationships/node/,vx347,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f3d0a39ad5a1026d10a432/,59f3d0a39ad5a1026d10a432,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q6kz5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q6kz5/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q6kz5

That Is the Question in EU Copyright Reform,"This article discusses the proposed introduction in EU law of an obligation for hosting providers to conclude licencing agreements with copyright holders and ensure their functioning by taking effective technological measures — such as content id technologies — to prevent copyright infringement on online platforms. This proposal is included in Article 13 — and accompanying Recitals — of the European Commission’s Draft Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market of September 14, 2016, which forms an important part of the ongoing EU copyright reform. This article highlights the shortcoming of this proposed reform, which might fall short in terms of clarity, consistency with the EU acquis, appropriacy and proportionality. In doing so, the article discusses recent CJEU case law — such as GSMedia, Ziggo and Filmspeler — struggling with the notion of communication to the public in the digital environment. It highlights systemic inconsistencies between the traditional knowledge-and-take-down negligence-based intermediary liability system and the introduction of filtering and monitoring obligations. The article examines the appropriacy of filtering — and monitoring — measures within a fundamental rights perspective by considering proportionality between property rights’ enforcement and competing fundamental rights — such as freedom of expression, freedom of business and privacy. The critical review of the proposed reform serves as an opportunity to briefly advance an alternative proposal seeking a more pragmatical engagement with technological change through an arrangement enforcing a liability rule or an apportionment of profits and producing value for creators out of platform economy’s virality, while limiting negative externalities on users’ rights.",TRUE,FALSE,copyright|European law|filtering|infringement|intermediary liability|monitoring|piracy|platforms|reform|value gap,2018-07-02T11:19:42.209486,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-10-28T00:26:01.435942,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c22|Law|Computer Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c2a|Law|Law and Politics|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c42|Law|Commercial Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c54|Law|Entertainment, Arts, and Sports Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c61|Law|Torts|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c69|Law|Internet Law",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67n5w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67n5w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67n5w/citation/,67n5w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67n5w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ntwzq/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67n5w/relationships/node/,ntwzq,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67n5w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59f3cdd06c613b026c4f621f/,59f3cdd06c613b026c4f621f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67n5w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67n5w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67n5w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/67n5w/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/67n5w
