But, few empirical studies have looked closely at how institutions become relatively distinct cultural and structural domains. This paper examines how institutional entrepreneurs—in this case, Major League Baseball (MLB) sportswriters—build and sustain institutional boundaries by considering how they create a distinct cultural discourse that infuses baseball places, times, and events with culturally distinct meanings. Drawing from sportswriters’ columns, documentaries, and monographs written on baseball, we show that MLB entrepreneurs have developed and disseminated a discourse oriented around the generalized medium of sport exchange, interaction, and communication: competitiveness. Using these data, the paper below examines how this medium becomes quantified and embodied in tangible and intangible forms. Additionally, the paper draws on sports columns that illustrate how MLB entrepreneurs protect the autonomy of a sacred core (the Hall of Fame) from internal threats (gambling and performance-enhancement drugs) and external corruption (the influence of money). The paper ends with a discussion of implications for the applicability of the findings to other sports and institutional domains.",TRUE,FALSE,baseball|cultural sociology|institutions|moral entrepreneurship|sport,2018-07-02T11:53:27.942402,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-22T20:33:36.727917,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/citation/,peqjk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eqr5k/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/relationships/node/,eqr5k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0474cfc4deab001193d379/,5b0474cfc4deab001193d379,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/peqjk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/peqjk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/peqjk,NA

Conventional measures of segregation have been criticised for ignoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of everyday life, which are theorized to influence the ease of interaction between people. In this paper we explore a Social Interaction Potential based measure of racial segregation (SIP-Seg). SIP-Seg attempts to quantify the time-geographic constraints on between-group and within-group interaction opportunities based on the spatial distributions of residences, workplaces, and the daily commute. We compute SIP-Seg for all Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States, and regress them against conventional measures of segregation as well as a host of factors capturing the spatial structure of regions. Our results indicate that the relationship between zonal segregation and SIP-Seg is strong, but the strongest explanatory factors are race-disaggregated commuting distances, which explain far more of the variance than non-racial spatial structure factors. The research suggests that SIP-Seg captures a spatiotemporal dimension of segregation that is ignored by conventional measures.",TRUE,FALSE,segregation|social interaction potential|transportation,2018-07-02T11:53:27.823162,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-22T20:32:47.895906,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvpt6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvpt6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvpt6/citation/,uvpt6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvpt6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/us96p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvpt6/relationships/node/,us96p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvpt6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b046e07c4deab001093d67d/,5b046e07c4deab001093d67d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvpt6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvpt6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uvpt6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uvpt6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uvpt6,NA

After 1500, with the descending of the European traders on its shores, the cotton textile industry boomed. It accounted for nearly two-fifths of all textile exports to Europe from Asia. I attempt, in this essay, to understand the ‘Global Divergence’ debate in South Asia with a focus on Bengal and its trade and production in cotton textiles. I situate Bengal as a central region of cotton production and trade in the early modern global economy with regards to not only Europe but also to other parts of Asia and within the sub-continent itself. I reiterate Prasannan Parthasarathi’s contribution to the ‘Great Divergence’ debate to argue that Bengal hosted a thriving cotton textile industry deep into the late eighteenth century. I echo that the destruction of the textile industry occurred in the high days of colonialism in the latter half of the nineteenth century. I attempt to substantiate this by trying to understand Om Prakash’s analysis of the methods of procurement of production before and after the ascendency of the Europeans as political administratorsin Bengal; when production by weavers was market driven and when it was driven by coercion and impunity, respectively.

In its post-War setting, it aimed to promote the new Man by crossing the anxious binaries of Cold War politics. In reality, however, it fed on these very anxieties with the USA and USSR using art, technology, architectural designs to further the propaganda of their respective competing antagonistic political worldview. But, some small countries like the Soviet satellite states of Czechoslovakia and Hungary made a significant impact through their pavilions on the millions of visitors. The death of Stalin in 1953 followed by the comparatively liberal policies of Khrushchev and the consequent political disturbances in Hungary and, political reforms in Czechoslovakia determined the content and styling of the pavilions at the Expo. Both the countries marked a shift from socialist realism and posited themselves through art, architecture or technological displays which were more abstract, innovative, individualistic, existential, humanistic and even avant-garde. Moreover, the local, regional, ethnic and even the national were strongly emphasized in the pavilions, some of which at times were bereft of the traditional symbolism of a socialist state. The emphasis on the national illustrated the contradictions in the ideology and action of politics in these east and central European countries in the light of the post-Stalinist era. These contradictions, not only helped to realign the dominance of socialism internally, but had global implications and intentions in the cultural Cold War, which were played out through the content and styling of the pavilions at the expo in Brussels.",TRUE,FALSE,Cold War|Communism|Cultural Politics|EXPO|Modernity|National|Nationalism|Socialism|USA|USSR,2018-07-02T11:53:27.365964,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-22T18:33:56.022601,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cda|Arts and Humanities|History|Public History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdc|Arts and Humanities|History|Cultural History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce3|Arts and Humanities|History|European History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/citation/,mgvx6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b59qg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/relationships/node/,b59qg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b0438fee9cb340012b39a81/,5b0438fee9cb340012b39a81,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mgvx6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mgvx6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mgvx6,NA

Social anthropologists have written nuanced ethnographies of how the environmental projects of governments and transnational NGOs encounter, dispossess, clash culturally with, and try to govern native people across the world. Yet, these diverse ethnographies often say little about what motivates those encounters firstly: local and global nature, especially wildlife, plants, and the planet’s ecological crisis. Thus, this paper seeks ways how ethnographic writing on conservation practice could better reflect that the planet’s many self-willed, struggling, and valued non-humans, too, enter conservation’s encounters. To find paths toward such a ‘wild-ing’ of ethnography, the paper locates and reviews disparate materials from across the social-anthropological literature on biodiversity conservation. The review is structured through three questions: How does and could the ethnography of conservation represent nature’s value? How can it show that animals, plants, and other nature make and meet worlds? How can it incorporate natural science data about non-human worlds and ecological crisis?

The more often students attend class and access on-campus learning resources, the better their grades and the lower their dropout rates. Despite the importance of on-campus participation in student outcomes, some students living in large cities face tremendous transportation and time-use barriers that make it difficult to spend more time on campus. Accordingly, the objective of our project is to examine the mobility factors that prevent students from attending their campuses in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Specifically, we examine student disparities in barriers to participate based on where they live, their mobility options, as well as the time constraints of their daily activity patterns (e.g. part time work). Data for our project is drawn from a 1-day travel survey of students across seven university campuses in the GTA. This is augmented with computationally derived transport accessibility factors. Multivariate logistic regression models are then employed to uncover the mobility-related determinants for a) if students feel commuting discourages them from travelling to campus; b) if students pick courses based on their commute; c) if commuting discourages students from participating in university organized activities; and d) how many days per week a student visits campus. The results of these models fuel a discussion of how to limit mobility-related barriers to postsecondary student participation.",TRUE,FALSE,activity participation|commuting|logistic regression|time use|university students,2018-07-02T11:53:26.061794,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-05-22T18:31:17.509259,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/citation/,q652t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/e7z35/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/relationships/node/,e7z35,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b035843a556d00014078808/,5b035843a556d00014078808,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q652t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q652t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q652t,NA

Pinchot advocated conservation of natural resources to be used for human purposes; Muir advocated protection from humans, for nature's own sake.  In the first half of the 20th century, natural re-source economics was firmly in Pinchot's side of that schism.  That position began to change as the post-war environmental movement gained momentum.  In particular, John Krutilla, an economist at Resources for the Future, pushed economics to the point that it could embrace Muir's vision as well as Pinchot's.  Krutilla argued that if humans preferred a preserved state to a developed one, then such preferences were every bit as ""economic.""
