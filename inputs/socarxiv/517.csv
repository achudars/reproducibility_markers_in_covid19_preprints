Adults diagnosed with ASD show a lot of comorbidity and overlapping symptomatology with other neuropsychiatric conditions that require specific approaches. The development of ReAttach supports a dynamic special educational model for autism. Indicating the clinical characteristics of ASD as a reflection of the pre-conceptual stage, the ReAttach for autism protocol is characterized by activating the skills that are required for integration, conceptualisation, imagination and coping. ReAttach starts with external arousal regulation by the therapist to obtain optimal environmental conditions for learning. The term dynamic refers to the personal growth that individuals with ASD and patients with other neuropsychiatric conditions have shown. If core ASD symptomatology, such as lack of coherency, monotropic information processing and social communication problems, can be reduced by intervention it is time to embrace a dynamic model for autism.
Objective: The objective is to propose a dynamic special education model for autism and to communicate how indicating the clinical characteristics of ASD as a reflection of the pre-conceptual stage sheds a different light on comparative research of ASD versus neurotypical groups.
Method: The procedure of a comparative study of an autism and a neurotypical control group is reviewed from a dynamic special education model. The questions and remarks about the instructions and findings are displayed.
Results: Reviewing the research procedure and findings from a dynamic special educational model sheds a different light on this comparative research of ASD versus neurotypical groups.",TRUE,FALSE,autism|pre-conceptual state of mind|special education,2018-11-26T02:37:46.763573,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-26T02:37:29.740719,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dab|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r34wz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r34wz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r34wz/citation/,r34wz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r34wz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ht9bu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r34wz/relationships/node/,ht9bu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r34wz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bfa869ac21cd8001ba327ff/,5bfa869ac21cd8001ba327ff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r34wz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r34wz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r34wz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r34wz/,https://doi.org/10.26407/2018jrtdd.1.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r34wz

Stefan Collini, writing in the London Review of Books, found himself “experiencing a rare, and wholly unironic, feeling that mixes pride and humility with a dash of wonder” when he considered “generations to come making use of this vast consolidation of scholarly accuracy for purposes of their own which may be barely imaginable to us now.” Taking into account both the hardbound version and what most assume is its digital doppelgänger at oxforddnb.com, Noel Malcolm in The Sunday Telegraph called the ODNB “an astonishing piece of work: a colossal, beautiful, fully functional and utterly user-friendly engine of enlightenment.” Reviewers’ initial responses—awe and astonishment—have, until recently, arguably been the responses most appropriate to the ODNB considered in its entirety.

Interrogating the OECD’s International Early Learning Study from an anti-colonialist perspective,"In this article, I discuss the International Early Learning and Child Well-being Study (IELS), which is currently being rolled out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and De-velopment (OECD). I summarise the development of IELS and the critique that has been voiced by early childhood scholars, professionals and advocates. I then move to an aspect of IELS that has so far been absent from the discussion: the actual conduct of the test, using the two stylised child characters Tom and Mia. I provide a provisional reading of the Tom and Mia imaginary through the lens of post- and neo-colonial analysis. Applying the concept of colonisation as a frame of reference opens a space for introducing resistance and anti-colonial practices as productive forces to challenge the global hegemony.

In this study, I use data from different waves of the Indonesian Village Potential Statistics (Potensi Desa) to determine whether mobile phone signal strength affects village policies and civic engagement activities. The results indicate that villages with a strong signal are statistically more likely to possess the proper infrastructure and economic programs. Furthermore, mobile phones increase civic engagement, which is consistent with previous studies related to collective action or mass mobilisation. Using the plausibly exogenous variation of lightning strike intensity as the instrumental variable, this study suggests that higher mobile phone signal strength is positively associated with the policies implemented by the village head. This study also demonstrates that ICT has a stronger effect in rural areas. One possible explanation is that mobile phones improve the relative ability for rural people to interact with their leaders. Another potential answer is the fact that there are significant differences between rural village and urban village governments, which could also affect policymaking.",TRUE,FALSE,Accountability|ICT|Indonesia|Mobile Phone|Policy Making|Village Leader,2018-11-23T11:27:21.814693,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-23T11:26:54.979326,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,Jahen Rezki,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s784/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s784/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s784/citation/,3s784,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s784/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s784/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s784/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bf6cd2a7a554700166fa2b0/,5bf6cd2a7a554700166fa2b0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s784/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s784/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3s784/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3s784/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3s784

This study uses a new database that covers 427 districts in Indonesia, from 2000 to 2013. In Indonesia, local governments are largely responsible for fulfilling basic service delivery and, in this regard, they are extremely powerful. Political competition is measured using the Herfindahl Hirschman Concentration Index for the district parliament election. This variable is potentially endogenous, because political competition is likely to be non-random and correlated with unobservable variables. To solve this problem, I use the lag of political competition for neighbouring districts within the same province, as well as the political competition from the 1955 general election, as instrumental variables for political competition. The degree of political competition has been found to boost real Regional Gross Domestic Product (RGDP) per capita by 1.9%. Furthermore, a one standard deviation increase in political competition would increase RGDP growth by approximately 0.81%. The results also support the findings of previous studies, which have found that stiffer political competition is associated with higher public spending (e.g. infrastructure spending) and pro-business policies.",TRUE,FALSE,Economic Performance|Indonesia|Political Competition|Regional Government,2018-11-23T11:25:21.752611,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-11-23T11:25:03.722465,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics,Jahen Rezki,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nekps/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nekps/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nekps/citation/,nekps,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nekps/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nekps/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nekps/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bf6cb1a7a554700186f0edd/,5bf6cb1a7a554700186f0edd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nekps/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nekps/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nekps/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nekps/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nekps
