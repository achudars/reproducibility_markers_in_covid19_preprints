Mass media has the potential to disseminate information on maternal healthcare that can improve birth outcomes for mothers and infants, particularly among women with limited educational attainment. This study examines the impact of mass media exposure (e.g., television, radio, and newspaper) and sociodemographic factors on maternal healthcare utilization in four South Asian countries: India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Afghanistan. Analyses use 2014–2016 Demographic and Health Surveys, nationally representative surveys of women aged 15–49 years. Results show that maternal healthcare utilization is significantly higher among women exposed to mass media across countries, even after controlling for mother’s, husband’s, and household socioeconomic status. Women exposed to mass media are 39–113% more likely to receive antenatal care, 17–99% more likely to deliver their babies by skilled birth attendants, and 24–95% more likely to receive postpartum check-ups after their delivery across countries.

Previous research is limited by not taking competing dimensions of SES transmission into account when assessing performances of occupational scales. Using Swedish administrative data, we find, in contrast to classical findings, that  the composite International Socio-Economic Index of occupational status (ISEI) has the highest intergenerational correlations net of other SES dimensions (education, income and wealth), followed by Treiman measure of occupational prestige (SIOPS).   The now popular measure of occupational education following from Hauser and Warren (1997) suffer from slightly larger overlap with education; more of its intergenerational correlation is explained by parents’ education.

While there is already a growing body of research on specific aspects of platform governance (algorithms, content moderation, policies), there is still only little theoretical grounding of these debates in social theory. 

This paper addresses this gap by proposing a concept of platform governance based on institutional theory that understands governance as reflexive coordination, and thus different from regulation. Such a concept promises instructive insights into different forms of mediating communication and transactions by platforms. 

In the second part of the paper, we apply this concept to content moderation and regulation on Facebook. This empirical part is based on a study of the evolving policies and practices with regard to handling controversial content (nudity, hate speech, fake news) on the platform over a timeframe of 10 years. This is contextualised with a discourse analysis of public debates and policy proposals on these issues.",TRUE,FALSE,facebook|fake news|governance|hate speech|misinformation|platform governance|social media,2020-01-24T14:49:41.734031,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-24T14:48:57.909963,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aj34w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aj34w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aj34w/citation/,aj34w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aj34w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aj34w/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gh9va/,gh9va,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aj34w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2972c287a1d900261d04eb/,5e2972c287a1d900261d04eb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aj34w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aj34w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aj34w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aj34w/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aj34w

Findings from previous research have shown that income inequality is positively associated with population change, but these studies have not explicitly tested for differences between the impacts of population growth and decline. Understanding the implications of population dynamics is particularly important given that many rural areas are characterized by population decline. We analyze county-level data (n=15,375 county-decades) from the Decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS), applying fixed effects models to estimate the respective effects of population growth and decline on income inequality, to identify the processes that mediate the links between population change and inequality, and to assess whether these effects are moderated by county-level economic and demographic characteristics. We find evidence that population decline is associated with increased levels of income inequality relative to counties experiencing stable and high rates of population growth. This relationship remains robust across a variety of model specifications, including models that account for changes in counties’ employment, sociodemographic, and ethnoracial composition. We also find that the relationship between income inequality and population change varies by metropolitan status, baseline level of inequality, and region.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-01-24T14:50:01.280478,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-24T14:49:26.049312,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",Jalycn Butler|Grace Wildermuth|Brian Thiede|and David Brown,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3yhe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3yhe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3yhe/citation/,g3yhe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3yhe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3yhe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3yhe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e2875ea59684b00886b912a/,5e2875ea59684b00886b912a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3yhe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3yhe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g3yhe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g3yhe/,https://doi.org/10.1111/ruso.12354,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g3yhe

The regime has deliberately supported several armed non-state actors to achieve the goals, particularly as seen in its relations with Lebanese Hezbollah and Shia groups in Iraq, the IRGC has served as a node in providing a broad range of state support. Although the IRGC has the characteristics of conventional armed forces, its extraterritorial activities contradict the legal frame of ‘use of military force’ and mostly fit the characteristics of ‘state sponsorship of terrorism.’ Moreover, these activities challenge international norms and provoke other regional actors. This condition creates an obstacle to Iran’s integration into the international system which is increasingly globalized and interconnected and an environment which is costly to live within and leaves it isolated. These attitudes paradoxically place Iran in a situation that challenges the goals of ‘state security and survival’ and ‘becoming the regional power’ in the long run.

These changes have been aligned with a restricted and rather uniform conceptualisation of what science is, and knowledge is made. However, knowledge-making is not a uniform affair. Here, we reflect on a salient fault line running through Wissenschaft (the whole of academic knowledge making, spanning the sciences and humanities), grounded in the relationship between the acts of research and writing, separating research as reporting from research as writing. We do so to demonstrate that replication and replicability cannot be treated as uniformly applicable and that assessment and improvement of research quality invites various tools and strategies.

However, we still know relatively little about the micro-level processes that account for this empirical regularity. Our study examines the roles of two individual-level characteristics—cognitive ability and locus of control—in mediating the effect of individuals’ parental class background on their educational attainment and social class position in Britain. We find that cognitive ability mediates only about 35 per cent of the total parental class effect on educational attainment and only about 20 per cent of the total parental class effect on respondents’ social class position, net of their educational attainment. These findings contradict existing claims that differences in the life chances of children from different social class backgrounds are largely due to differences in cognitive ability. Moreover, we find that although individuals’ locus of control plays some role in mediating the parental class effect, its role is substantially smaller than the mediating role of cognitive ability. We measure individuals’ social class positions at different points in their careers—at labour market entry and at occupational maturity—and find that the mediating roles of cognitive ability and locus of control are remarkably stable across individuals’ working lives.",TRUE,FALSE,1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70)|Cognitive ability|Educational inequality|Inequality of opportunity|Intergenerational social mobility|Locus of Control|Meritocracy|Social inequality|Social justice,2020-01-22T12:26:24.716914,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-22T12:26:08.548265,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqtwc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqtwc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqtwc/citation/,rqtwc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqtwc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqtwc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqtwc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e28124059684b00496b9741/,5e28124059684b00496b9741,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqtwc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqtwc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rqtwc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rqtwc/,https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12732,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rqtwc

Estimating Geographical Bias in the Multilingual Record of Biographies on Wikipedia,"This article proposes that an appropriate assessment of the geographical bias in Wikipedia's content should consider not only the number of articles linked to places but also their internal positioning (i.e. their location in different languages and their centrality in the network of references between articles). This idea is studied empirically, systematically evaluating the geographic concentration in the biographical coverage of globally recognized individuals (those whose biographies are found in more than 25 language versions of Wikipedia). Considering the positioning levels of these biographies, only 5 countries account for more than 62% of Wikipedia's biographical coverage. In turn, the inequality in coverage between countries reaches very high levels, estimated with a Gini coefficient of .84 and a Palma ratio of 207. In all the tests carried out, the inclusion of the linguistic and/or relational positioning of the articles increases the estimate of inequality in biographical coverage. This suggests that previous estimates of geographical bias, which do not consider differences in positioning, have underestimated the degree of inequality in the distribution of information.",TRUE,FALSE,Digital divide|Geographical bias|Geo-tagged information|Information inequality|Knowledge inequality|Wikipedia,2020-01-22T14:53:40.876289,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-22T14:53:18.990851,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e17|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|International and Intercultural Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahykf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahykf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahykf/citation/,ahykf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahykf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahykf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahykf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e279d3259684b002e6b842a/,5e279d3259684b002e6b842a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahykf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahykf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ahykf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ahykf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ahykf

In a recent article in this journal, Diefendorf and Bridges contend that differences in findings of quantitative and qualitative research related to masculinities and homophobia demand new theories and methods to chart the enduring relationship between homophobia and masculinity. In this critical commentary, I demonstrate the flaws of the methodological framing and refute the characterization of qualitative literature provided. I argue that the theoretical errors in the original article are a result of inattention to social and historical context. Drawing attention to problematic citation practices, I call for critical approaches that recognize both positive social change and contexts where problematic dynamics persist.",TRUE,FALSE,hegemonic masculinity|homophobia|hybrid|inclusive|masculinities|masculinity|sexual prejudice,2020-01-22T14:56:01.956545,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-01-22T14:55:51.451563,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d3upj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d3upj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d3upj/citation/,d3upj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d3upj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d3upj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d3upj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e27448d675e0e020f6b55e2/,5e27448d675e0e020f6b55e2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d3upj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d3upj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d3upj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d3upj/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d3upj
