The problems we are referring to are associated to a particular case study in the Mayan area of Yucatan. In this place, where groundwater is the only source of freshwater, the inhabitants have to deal with water problems such as resource scarcity, groundwater pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource degradation. Further, it revealed that one way to improve conservation is to ensure the inclusion of cultural values between people and their environment and this is of significance for evolving strong relations with nature. We examined socio-ecological groundwater relations in contemporary Mayan society by analysing how the ancient Maya obtained freshwater, and how and why contemporary local Mayan communities of Yucatan, Mexico, have transformed the groundwater system by intensify groundwater pollution problems. Several authors have attempted to improve the understanding of complex processes underlying the Maya collapse, and the interactions of this society with nature. But, if the demise of the Mayan populations in the past was the result of complex social and ecological factors, then what are those relations, at present, and how they are conceptualized? What kind of government regulation is necessary, and how can communities make decisions to ensure solutions for conservation, at a time when cultural values, worldviews and traditional practices are being lost? To answer those questions, we review the background to the groundwater problem, and the historical and cultural context of Yucatan groundwater system. We use the Mayan society as a case study to elucidate this and of the induced collapse, exacerbated by the overuse of natural resources in a non- sustainable way. Nevertheless, a very complex traditional ecological knowledge and general worldview of the use of natural resources in Yucatan have significantly shaped the socio-environmental conditions in the region, in particular freshwater resources.",TRUE,FALSE,common pool resources|groundwater|Mayas|social-ecological system framework|Yucatan,2019-08-05T12:49:22.679753,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-05T12:49:04.894736,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/citation/,6nfwz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4754ff26ebf5001888103c/,5d4754ff26ebf5001888103c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nfwz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6nfwz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6nfwz,NA

Writing skill is an essential component in mastering English because it incorporates all elements in English. By integrating technology in the learning process, students would be able to improve their writing skill. In Malaysia, students’ performance in examination has declined in recent years since the marks are based mostly on students’ writing. This research aims to know the impact of Digital Storytelling towards Malaysian secondary school students by investigating its impact on content, grammar, vocabulary and overall performance. It also explores students' perception of Digital Storytelling. This quasi-experimental study involved 52 Form four students from a fully-residential school in Melaka who were chosen using convenient sampling as part of the controlled and experimental groups. Data were collected from pre-tests, post-tests and a semi-structured interview. The quantitative data were analyzed using mean analysis, Wilcoxon Signed Tank Test and Independent t-Test while qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings show that there is a significant difference in the score before and after the intervention but there is no significant difference between the score of the experimental group and the controlled group. Participants stated that DS motivates them to write and improves their writing. It is hoped that this study would provide an alternative to teaching narrative writing and adds to the current pool of literature.

This study aims at setting the fundamentals of materials development at the intersection of two major areas of contemporary education, namely the needs of the ‘net generation’ students and the educational potential of the evolving social web and digital technology. It seeks to answer the following questions: What is digital technology and how does it lead to U-learning? What is web 2.0 and how does it affect classroom pedagogy, practice, and the design of quality teaching/learning materials? How does it help teachers improve their practice and materials development procedures? And how can teachers transform today’s innovative technology into ubiquitous learning experiences, promoting learner autonomy, regardless of any geographical or institutional boundaries?

Informed by conversation analysis (CA) approach, this study aims to identify the opening sequences and ritual expressions of informal mobile phone conversations among Saudi friends and relatives. Another goal is that to identify whether the opening sequences of mobile phone are similar or different from the landline telephone. The study will answer the following questions: what are the opening sequences and ritual expressions of mobile phone? And what are the similarities and differences between mobile phone and landline telephone in terms of the opening sequences. Thirty audio-recorded and transcribed mobile phone conversations served as the data source for this study. Data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by using the CA approach. Findings showed that the majority of opening sequences of mobile phone calls were reduced to three sequences: summons answer, greeting exchanges, and how-are-you exchanges due the impact of caller ID. In addition, the sequence of identification/recognition can be found when the caller does not know the callee or the number is silent.  Therefore, mobile phone and landline telephone have similarities and differences in the opening sequences in general. However, the differences observed can be a reason of the cultural practices for language use more than the effect of medium used in communication such as landline telephone and mobile phone in Saudi Arabic.

In fact, across disciplines and contexts, the amplification of 21st century learning has been giving gamification a special place in education. There are numerous studies conducted on the use of gamification among school children, university students or even trainee teachers. Coincidentally, all of these studies have shown that gamification does impact their learning. Hence, as harmless as it seems, any teachers who are not equipped with such knowledge on the benefits of gamification may hinder their learners and themselves from reaching their utmost teaching and learning experience especially when it comes to grammar learning among the younger pupils. Considering this thought in mind, this research was conducted to prove that the use of Kahoot! helps the Year 3 pupils in retaining the English Irregular verbs. This quasi – experimental designed research gathered data from a sample of 35 Year 3 pupils using the pre-test and post-test results. The findings which were analysed descriptively using sample t-test showed that pupils’ performances in the post-test improved over the use of Kahoot! in classroom. In conclusion, this research provides an insight on number of ways that gamification can actually impacted the pupils’ learning; especially in terms of memory retention. It also works as a stepping stone for more researches to study on the effectiveness of using Kahoot! in tackling any part of learning especially among the younger learners.",TRUE,FALSE,Game-based student response system|gamification|irregular verbs|kahoot!|memory retention,2019-08-04T20:55:04.295273,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:54:51.224980,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/citation/,tqh6u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d47399690489f001a4a8392/,5d47399690489f001a4a8392,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tqh6u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tqh6u,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.15

The focus of the study was to investigate “the EFL learners’ perception about integrating blended learning in their English Language Teaching (ELT) process”.  For this purpose, a survey was constructed in three subsections investigating the learners’ viewpoints about BL as a platform: a) to improve learners’ interaction, b) to increase their interests, and c) to provide autonomous learning. A mixed approach was adopted for the study to be conducted in one of the largest universities in Saudi Arabia. The participants (n=120) taken as sample were studying intensive English courses at four different levels as per the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) during their first year at university. The data was collected by using the designed survey consisting sixteen closed and an open-ended question to investigate the learners’ perceptions in depth.  The results indicate an overall positive attitude of the learners towards BL integration. ANOVA analysis of the variables shows insignificant effect of the ‘level of computer proficiency’ and the ‘level of learners’ language skills’ on their perceptions. The results conclude that the learners’ perceptions are found in favour of BL. Thus, it is recommended to integrate BL to increase the learners’ interest, interaction, and autonomy.",TRUE,FALSE,blended learning|BL integration|ELT|learners’ autonomy,2019-08-04T20:55:42.012789,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04T20:55:15.496701,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/citation/,nmjf2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d47388f90489f001c49d771/,5d47388f90489f001c49d771,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nmjf2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nmjf2,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.14
