However, there remains considerable uncertainty in the empirical literature, in part because different studies operationalise the measurement of drug dependency in different ways. Some, for example, use comprehensive and sophisticated clinical instruments, others use simplified screening tools, while some use single-item self-report measures. Whichever the method, each is an attempt to accurately operationalise the manifestation of drug dependency as an objective trait, yet through their mode of administration, they undoubtedly capture other confounds. The resulting bias can have significant implications for the subsequent estimation of the drug crime relationship, especially if a mode of administration (such as the single-measure self-report) crosses over into other important domains such as personal and social identity. The present study examined the correlation between self-reported drug dependency and crime among a large sample of Australian police detainees who were affirmatively screened for dependency on UNCOPE—a six item clinical screening tool which operationalises dependency as the presence of multiple behavioural and affective experiences of compulsive drug use (Hoffmann, Hunt, Rhodes, &amp; Riley, 2003; Proctor &amp; Hoffmann, 2016). Using a mix of descriptive and negative binominal regression techniques, we modelled the frequency of self-reported prior offending in the past 12 months using data from the Drug Use Monitoring in Australia program. After controlling for type, frequency, and longevity of drug use, as well as other demographic factors, we find that those who self-report a drug dependency have higher average rates of prior offending. We argue that these results reflect the social and cultural power of drug-dependency identities and the centrality of identity as a third, often unobserved variable in the drug-crime correlation. These result will assist criminologists and criminal justice professionals in further developing interventions to assist drug dependent offenders within the criminal justice system.",TRUE,FALSE,crime|criminal offending|dependency|drug use|identity|self-report,2020-04-08T13:26:24.035936,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-08T13:26:10.199389,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Cameron T.

ReflectingTeachingArtisticResearch.,"The name “Ludics,” is derived from the term “ludus,” meaning “play,” a term that is useful in connection with games and rules of play. As a concept for artistic research, the Ludic method is introduced here as it combines both games and rules of play. Conceptual ludic art explores rules of play, systems of investigation and knowledge acquisition through game mechanics as well as the fundamentals of perception, experience and cognition. The theory and practice of artistic research are concerned with ludic methods of approaching art and science and epistemic things (“Erkenntnisgegnstände”), insights achieved through research. Their goals are written fictitiously, presented participatively and made public processually. The methods of artistic research comprise contradictions, and are found in feedback between peers in conference contributions and in exhibitions, between radical artistic uniqueness and the claim of universal validity (which is required for the validation of artistic research). We need to clarify the scientific understanding of epistemic things, and as a consequence, introduce a new concept of a ludic artistic research epistemé. Ludic objects are artefacts that trigger discourse and the application of certain rules of research. They constitute an interplay of art and knowledge. Teaching this understanding is equally tied to a certain playful approach toward serious, rule-driven research. Following a ludic method, we introduce a new trope to artistic research, the idea of a playful movement in thinking that dissolves the established trope of art as a field with no further connections than aesthetics per se. The ludic objective thus stems from technologies and cultural techniques of insight, as well as theories, experiments and philosophical conceptions that are connected to the perceived, conceived and lived world.",TRUE,FALSE,epistemology|experiments|ludic objects|udic research method,2020-04-07T21:58:31.677709,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-07T19:05:06.485600,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cca|Arts and Humanities|Art Practice,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/citation/,7j32f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8cb7d4f135350134d53be5/,5e8cb7d4f135350134d53be5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7j32f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7j32f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7j32f,NA

With the aim of assessing how this phenomenon has been studied to date from an evidence-based approach, a quantitative systematic review has been conducted on the basis of gathering information from the most recent scientific literature (2014-2019) on strategies for improving urban safety in smart city scenarios. Specifically, it was systematised according to different variables such as research designs, results of the implementation of measures to improve urban safety, crimes assessed, fields of application of the measures and problems associated with the use of these measures. As a result, the majority of the studies examined are of a cross-sectional, non-experimental nature. Also, most results are descriptive and the preventive measures evaluated have positive effects.

Latin American noncitizens—encompassing undocumented and documented immigrants—are targeted for deportation. Deportation’s threat also reaches naturalized and US-born citizens of Latino descent who are largely immune to deportation but whose loved ones or communities are deportable. Drawing on 6 y of data from the National Survey of Latinos, this article examines whether and how Latinos’ deportation fears vary by citizenship and legal status and over time. Compared with Latino noncitizens, Latino US citizens report lower average deportation fears. However, a more complex story emerges when examining this divide over time: Deportation fears are high but stable among Latino noncitizens, whereas deportation fears have increased substantially among Latino US citizens. These trends reflect a growing national awareness of—rather than observable changes to—deportation policy and practice since the 2016 US presidential election.

Does the impact vary over their children’s early life course, and are there differences across the social strata? We studied these research questions with Finnish register-based data on 6,542 pairs of twins born from 1975 to 1986. We applied the classical twin design to estimate the relative importance of genes. As outcomes, we compared education, occupation, and income in early adulthood. We found that shared environment influences were negligible in all cases. Notably, the proportion of genetic effects explained by parental characteristics mattered most for education and for occupation only because they were associated with their children’s education—but not for income. We did not find any variation across their early life course; however, we found that genetic influences were stronger among the advantaged families for income and education. Thus, gene-environment interactions (GxE) operate differently for different status-related characteristics. For the unique environment, the pattern was consistent across outcomes as the effect was greater among the advantaged families. Stratification scholars should therefore emphasize the importance of the unique environment as one of the drivers of the intergenerational transmission of social inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,education|gene-environment correlation|gene-environment interaction|genes|income|INVEST Flagship Working Papers|occupational status|shared environment|socioeconomic background|unique environment,2020-04-07T21:58:30.325341,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-07T19:13:41.002235,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",Jani Erola,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gahfc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gahfc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gahfc/citation/,gahfc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gahfc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gahfc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gahfc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8c55e7d6973500febdac26/,5e8c55e7d6973500febdac26,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gahfc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gahfc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gahfc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gahfc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gahfc,NA

This position paper scrutinizes this so-called ‘Ed-Tech speak’ via narrative methodology. The analytical focus is the paradoxes that exist between the normalizing master narratives of Ed-Tech speak and the complexity and polyphony of everyday praxis in terms of participation. By using an educational tablet project conducted in Finnish primary and secondary schools as an empirical example this paper will problematize the promise of participation in the context of the digitalization of education through three different viewpoints: paradoxes of societal participation, paradoxes of participatory pedagogics, and paradoxical politics of participation.",TRUE,FALSE,Counter narrative|Digitalization|Educational technology|Master narrative|Paradox|Participation,2020-04-07T21:59:01.440589,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-07T19:15:39.628723,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8uh3v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8uh3v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8uh3v/citation/,8uh3v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8uh3v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8uh3v/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8uh3v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8c3606d6973500f6be2f26/,5e8c3606d6973500f6be2f26,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8uh3v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8uh3v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8uh3v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8uh3v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8uh3v,https://doi.org/10.1080/17439884.2020.1696362
