But it is less clear how these governments justify the management of such elections, and whether they are accepted by the population.

Previous research on the connection between high unemployment and media discourse has often relied on case studies of periods when stigmatising rhetoric about the poor was increasing. We build on earlier work on how economic context affects media representations of poverty by creating a unique dataset that measures how often stigmatising descriptions of the poor are used in five centrist and right-wing British newspapers between 1896 and 2000. Our results suggest stigmatising rhetoric about the poor increases when unemployment rises, except at the peak of very deep recessions (e.g. the 1930s and 1980s). This pattern is consistent with the idea that newspapers deploy deeply embedded Malthusian explanations for poverty when those ideas resonate with the economic context, and so this stigmatising rhetoric of recessions is likely to recur during future economic crises.",TRUE,FALSE,media|poverty|recession,2019-04-09T19:22:27.684619,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-09T19:15:04.909833,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/citation/,kn9z7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/atse3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/relationships/node/,atse3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cace0ace3915600165d2a6e/,5cace0ace3915600165d2a6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kn9z7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kn9z7,https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038519838752

This creates a barrier to the adoption of purchasing behaviours that would help protect consumers from cybercrime.  One proposal to address this is for IoT devices to carry a security label to help consumers navigate the market. Using a discrete choice experiment, we estimate the potential impact of such labels on participant’s decision making, after controlling for the influence of device functionality and price.  We estimate the impact of three different labelling schemes on consumer choice, and their willingness to pay for devices that carried each of them.  With the exception of a Graded label that implied a device had weak security, participants were significantly more likely to select a device that carried a label than one that did not. Participants were also willing to pay more for devices with premium functionality and those that came with a security label.  While they were generally willing to pay more for premium functionality than security, for two of the labels tested, they were prepared to pay the same amounts. Qualitative responses suggest that participants would use a label to inform purchasing decisions, and that the labels did not generate a false sense of security.  Our findings suggest that the use of a security label represents a policy option that could influence behaviour and that should be seriously considered.",TRUE,FALSE,Internet of Things|Labelling schemes|Willingness to Pay,2019-04-08T22:26:01.492933,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-08T22:25:43.860727,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Shane D Johnson|John Blythe|Matthew Manning|and Gabriel Wong,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/citation/,4yxp2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cab84f9641d10001abfc6d8/,5cab84f9641d10001abfc6d8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4yxp2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4yxp2,NA

However, it also introduces new potential security threats and risks. These include threats that range from the direct hacking of devices
that could undermine the security, privacy and safety of its users, to the enslaving of IoT devices to commit cybercrime at scale, such as Denial of Service attacks. The IoT is recognised as being widely insecure, in large part, due to the lack of security features built into devices. Additionally, consumers
do not always actively use security features when available. More disconcerting is that we lack market surveillance on whether manufacturers ship products with good security features or how the importance of user-controlled security features is explained to IoT users. Our study seeks to address this gap. To do this, we compiled a database of 270 consumer IoT devices produced by 220 different manufacturers on sale at the time of the study. The user manuals and associated support pages for these devices were then analysed to provide a “consumer eye” view of the security features they provide and the cyber hygiene advice that is communicated to users. The security features identified were then mapped to the UK Government's Secure by Design Code of Practice for IoT devices to examine the extent to which devices currently on the market appear to conform to it. Our findings suggest that manufacturers provide too little publicly-available information about the security features of their devices which makes market surveillance challenging and provides consumers with little information about the security of devices prior to their purchase. On average, there was discussion of around four security features, with account
management and software updates being the most frequently mentioned. Advice to consumers on cyber hygiene was also rarely provided. Finally, we found a lack of standardisation in the communication of security-related information for IoT devices among our sample. We argue for government intervention in this space to provide assurances around device security, whether this provided in a centralised or
decentralised manner.",TRUE,FALSE,Consumer IoT|Internet of Things (IoT)|IoT Security,2019-04-08T22:25:41.941152,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-08T22:25:18.205383,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,John M Blythe|Nissy Sombatruang|Shane D Johnson,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/citation/,63zkt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cab6b2e08a3bf001b01c60e/,5cab6b2e08a3bf001b01c60e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/63zkt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/63zkt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/63zkt,NA

Still, the conventional FE estimator relies on the assumption of parallel trends between treated and untreated groups. It returns biased results in the presence of heterogeneous slopes or growth curves that are related to the parameter of interest (e.g., selection into treatment is based on individual growth of the outcome). In this study, we derive the bias in conventional FE models, and show that fixed effects individual slope (FEIS) models can overcome this problem. This is a more general version of the conventional FE model, which accounts for heterogeneous slopes or trends, thereby providing a powerful tool for panel data and other multilevel data in general. We propose two versions of the Hausman test that can be used to identify misspecification in FE models. The performance of the FEIS estimator and the specification tests is evaluated in a series of Monte Carlo experiments. Using the examples of the marital wage premium and returns to preschool education (Head Start), we demonstrate how taking heterogeneous effects into account can seriously change the conclusions drawn from conventional FE models. Thus, we propose to test for bias in FE models in practical applications and to apply FEIS if indicated by the specification tests.",TRUE,FALSE,fixed effects|fixed effects individual slopes|Hausman test|Head Start returns|heterogeneous effects|marital wage premium|Monte Carlo simulations,2019-04-08T22:24:28.126999,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-08T22:24:00.539812,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Tobias Rüttenauer|Volker Ludwig,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/citation/,k4rnu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dr8x3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/relationships/node/,dr8x3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cab46cbdf977b001af44b10/,5cab46cbdf977b001af44b10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k4rnu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k4rnu,https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124120926211

Family theories hypothesize that disruption of household routines and reduction in household resources link family instability to poorer child well-being. Recent research reveals that maternal partnership transitions represent a small fraction of the household instability children experience. These other forms of household instability might also be consequential for child well-being. The goal of this study is to determine whether household instability involving non-parental household members in children’s households is associated with changes in children’s educational outcomes using longitudinal data available in the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Preliminary results suggest household instability by siblings and non-nuclear members, and residential instability predict higher likelihood of dropping out of high school, repeating grades and decreased interest in school.",TRUE,FALSE,Children|Educational Performance|Household Instability,2019-04-08T02:08:02.660763,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-08T02:07:38.512291,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Authors,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mp2sr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mp2sr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mp2sr/citation/,mp2sr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mp2sr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/42zx5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mp2sr/relationships/node/,42zx5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mp2sr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa755208a3bf001902eb9d/,5caa755208a3bf001902eb9d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mp2sr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mp2sr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mp2sr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mp2sr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mp2sr,NA

The problem formulation of this study is how the principle of composing listening materials that contain the value of local wisdom based on the dimensions of roles and parts. The findings of this study can be used as a reference in making learning models, especially listening materials which can be used as a means to foster students’ characters related to their culture and appreciation toward local wisdom. The research design used in this study is research and development (R &amp; D) design. This research produces roles with local wisdom to be an emotionally better person for a harmonious life, especially when the students are engaged in group discussion activities. To teach local wisdom related to environment care can be done through learning activities. It can be seen how the students are actively participating in the listening activities. Then, cognitive domain can be carried out in the learning process in the form of memorizing or remembering. Meanwhile, the affective domain can be performed through performance, discussion, and group work. It is expected that the finding can be an alternative reference to develop listening activities by internalizing local wisdom as a national identity. Also, the listening activities prepare young generations to preserve local wisdom from a nation.",TRUE,FALSE,internalization of local wisdom in listening activity|listening activity|local wisdom,2019-07-21T21:12:01.797753,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:11:48.766279,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86fxz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86fxz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86fxz/citation/,86fxz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86fxz/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86fxz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86fxz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa5c1c08a3bf00180174aa/,5caa5c1c08a3bf00180174aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86fxz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86fxz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/86fxz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/86fxz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/86fxz,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.31

Therefore, this study explores the use of metadiscourse in the second language (L2) academic writing by English as a foreign language (EFL) postgraduates in one of the Malaysian public universities. We analyzed the frequency and wordings of modality within the citations of the literature review chapters of 20 Ph.D. theses employing the Systemic Functional Linguistics. Data were analyzed manually utilizing the technique of quantifying the findings to highlight the similarities and differences in using metadiscourse markers. The findings revealed the dominance of full declarative clauses in both Applied Linguistics and Information Technology. Besides the Finite Modal Operators, Mood Adjuncts and Comment Adjuncts were also used to demonstrate modality with a variety in their stance, degrees, and frequencies. Pedagogically, these findings could help supervisors in identifying the implications of their students’ writings. In addition, students can be directed towards reading EAP textbooks and materials that are dedicated to areas of academic writing, metadiscourse markers, and citations.",TRUE,FALSE,EAP/ESP|EFL postgraduates|metadiscourse markers|stance|Systemic Functional Linguistics,2019-07-21T21:11:51.683737,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21T21:11:19.881978,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkf56/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkf56/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkf56/citation/,bkf56,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkf56/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkf56/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkf56/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa5b522aa0d90018d3036d/,5caa5b522aa0d90018d3036d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkf56/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkf56/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bkf56/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bkf56/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bkf56,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.30
