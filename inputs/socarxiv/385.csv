Entropy-maximizing spatial interaction models are a means of building parsimonious models that average over much of this small-scale complexity, while maintaining key large-scale structural features. Dynamic social interaction models extend this approach by allowing archaeologists to explore the co-evolution of human settlement systems and the networks of interaction that drive them. Yet, such models are often imprecise, relying on generalized notions of settlement ""influence"" and ""attractiveness"" rather than concrete material flows of goods and people. Here, I present a dis-aggregated spatial interaction model that explicitly resolves trade and migration flows and their combined influence on settlement growth and decline. I explore how the balance of costs and benefits of each type of interaction influence long-term settlement patterns. I find trade flows are the strongest determinant of equilibrium settlement structure, and that migration flows play a more transient role in balancing site hierarchies. This model illustrates how the broad toolkit for spatial interaction modeling developed in geography and economics can increase the precision of quantitative theory building in archaeology, and provides a road-map for connecting mechanistic models to the empirical archaeological record.",TRUE,FALSE,agricultural hinterland|archaeological networks|competition for resources|settlement patterns|spatial interaction model,2019-09-26T15:12:42.565612,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-26T15:12:02.526229,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/citation/,trbf8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8c5109c8a75d0019605f2a/,5d8c5109c8a75d0019605f2a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/trbf8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/trbf8,NA

In this study, we argue that communication practices are an important but overlooked factor in the formation of useful advice relationships between entrepreneurs, particularly in the context of developing economies. We hypothesize that improving entrepreneurs’ communication practices will affect the relationships they form and have implications for their business performance. To test our theory, we conducted a field experiment in Togo with 301 entrepreneurs who were randomized into a communication practices intervention that was embedded in a business training program. We found that entrepreneurs who were exposed to better communication practices perceived interactions more cooperatively and exchanged more information during those interactions. Moreover, improving communication practices also led to a 50 percent increase in the number of relationships entrepreneurs formed with peers. These relationships exhibited more matching based on skill and were more ethnically diverse. Finally, communication practices training also substantially increased entrepreneurs’ business performance.

How academic obituaries consecrate research biographies,"Academics undertake considerable efforts in order to define positions for themselves and for their peers that are meaningful and convey who they “are”. The current article examines how academics manage the practical task of making sense of one another by analyzing the way in which academic obituaries beget and consecrate research biographies. A qualitative analysis of 216 obituaries published in academic journals from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, in physics, history, and sociology, and from the 1960s to the 2000s reveals (e)valuative practices that consecrate academic subjects. The results demonstrate how obituaries: (1) categorize academic subjects by positioning them within spheres of academic knowledge and institutional posts, and (2) legitimize academic subjects by applying biographical narratives of talent and merit. This biographical (e)valuation evokes naturally talented, highly devoted academic subjects with coherent research profiles, and omits both biographical hurdles and the decedent’s gender and class.

However, a substantive interpretation of such typology can be questionable when clusters include sequences deviating from the others. We propose an integrated approach to identify such sequences, distinguishing between sequences presenting structural peculiarities and randomly deviating sequences. We monitor the quality of partitions with respect to the amount and type of deviation in each cluster relying on novel graphical tools allowing to properly visualize and closely inspect the structure of deviating sequences.

However, societal responses – from service providers, and friends and family – to help seeker’s disclosures of non-physical abuse are indicative of much narrower understandings. This thesis draws on qualitative data derived from semi-structured interviews with nine survivors of non-physical abuse to examine how responses to help seeking efforts influence stay/leave decision-making. Constructivist  grounded theory was used in the analysis of responses from which two categories emerged – invalidating and validating.  Invalidating responses inhibited further help seeking and prolonged exposure to abuse. Validating responses prompted efforts to alleviate or leave abuse. Drawing on the thesis findings, the discussion and analysis centre on better understanding the social foundations of decision-making and responses. These include: the reasons responses are so influential in the decision-making process, why responses are often incongruent with current policy and practice guidelines, conceptions of abuse in popular discourse, and the impact of social norms and popular discourse on non-help seeking behaviours. Following from this, some of the measures that might be employed to change societal responses to intimate partner abuse are discussed. The current study found that responses to participant’s help seeking efforts were influential in their decisions to stay in, or leave the relationship. The findings indicate that responses to help-seeking efforts are derived from public perceptions of, and attitudes to, intimate partner abuse. Poor understandings can result in poor responses, which can ultimately put the victim at risk. The current societal focus on physical manifestations of abuse belies the complexity of the problem and is detrimental to efforts to address intimate partner abuse.

I investigate the diffusion of medieval expulsions of Jews from polities in the Holy Roman Empire. For medieval rulers, religious and material concerns were strong rationales against expulsion. Yet expulsions increase markedly in the fifteenth century. Did an expulsion by one government affect another government’s choices about expulsion? Using event history analysis methods, I document the limited spread of expulsion among over 500 polities in the western Holy Roman Empire, 1385-1520 CE. Temporal and spatial trends indicate that expulsions in politically and economically powerful cities spurred expulsions generally but suppressed them nearby. The adoption of expulsion followed political and economic incentives that were embedded in inter-city relationships, particularly after theological changes gave expulsion fresh political value.

We re-examine this result controlling for the concurrent adoption of the Prospectus Directive (PD), which mandated increased IPO prospectus disclosures, and the enforcement of these disclosures in the member states of the European Union (EU). First, we find that there is a significant data error in Hong et al.’s study that renders their reported results unreliable: approximately 30% of the treatment firms this study categorizes as mandatory IFRS adoptions are not, in fact, subject to a mandate to report in IFRS. These are firms admitted to trading on “exchange-regulated” markets in the EU that do not require IFRS. We use hand-collected prospectus data to identify the correct treatment sample. Our analysis shows that, for affected firms, there is a statistically significant decrease in IPO underpricing associated with adoption of the PD for firms based in countries that also concurrently enhanced accounting enforcement (see Christensen, Hail, and Leuz 2013), but there is no association between mandatory IFRS adoption and IPO underpricing. We also examine voluntary IFRS adoptions by firms admitted to trading on exchange-regulated markets after 2005. Overall we find no evidence that mandatory IFRS adoption resulted in very large economic gains for IPO firms. This study also provides a brief but comprehensive description of much of EU capital markets law.",TRUE,FALSE,EU-Regulated Market|European Union|Exchange-Regulated Market|IPO Underpricing|Mandatory IFRS adoption|Prospectus Directive,2019-09-24T12:14:04.119498,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-24T11:07:46.530838,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b56u2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b56u2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b56u2/citation/,b56u2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b56u2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b56u2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b56u2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d88e476b3c374001a9ab1c3/,5d88e476b3c374001a9ab1c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b56u2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b56u2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b56u2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b56u2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b56u2,NA

The social stratification of food consumption profiles in Italy, 1997-2016","Using data from the Multiporpose Survey of Daily Life by ISTAT, this paper analyses the profiling and social stratification of food consumption among Italian adults from 1997 to 2016. We first apply Latent Class Analysis on a set of central food categories of the Mediterranean diet to document the existence of six consumption clusters, (herbivore, carnivore, hedonist, enhanced Mediterranean, paucivore, omnivore) and their relative size over time. Second, we employ fractional response models to illustrate how gender and education are associated with each of the identified clusters. Finally, we use variance-weighted least square regressions to document the evolution of gender and education gradients over time.
Results point to an increase in the relative size of the herbivores and omnivores, a substantial stability of the hedonists and paucivores, and a decline of the carnivores and enhanced Mediterraneans. Moreover, our findings highlight a substantial social stratification of food profiles and show that, within a broad picture of persistence, gender and education became more important in affecting the propensity of adopting certain profiles. Women and upper educated individuals are more likely to belong to clusters characterised by daily fruit and vegetable consumption. Moreover, women are also less likely to belong to clusters defined by the presence of alcoholics and soft drinks. In addition, the gap between upper and lower educated individuals in the probability of belonging to the omnivore profile, and the gap between women and men in the probability of belonging to the herbivore and hedonist profiles have increased over time.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural stratification|eating patterns|food consumption|health stratification|latent class analysis|omnivore-univore,2019-09-24T12:14:24.188731,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-24T11:08:04.021130,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Filippo Oncini &amp; Moris Triventi,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/citation/,32x6m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d88e06f53713d00191c03f6/,5d88e06f53713d00191c03f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/32x6m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/32x6m,NA
