However, the underlying philosophical basis for this system of rewards has gone largely unexamined. For example, implicit in the intellectual property system is a strong element of mind/body dualism that informs the incentives for technological development. In copyright, the work created and owned by an author is idealized as an intangible form, which may be embodied or fixed in a tangible medium of expression. The parallel patent law doctrine of inventorship shows an even more striking pattern of dualism. In the United States patent priority is decided primarily on the basis of conception of the invention in the mind of the inventor; the actual building or reduction to practice of the invention is held largely irrelevant.

Similarly, both patent and copyright doctrine entail a strong element of nature/culture dualism. In patent law, this manifests as the product of nature doctrine, holding that only the products of human effort are patentable, and not discoveries drawn from nature. In copyright, facts and other natural occurrences are excluded from copyright as being unoriginal, that is, not originating from the creativity of an author. Both systems assume that facts or properties embedded in the fabric of reality can be separated from the human activity that observes and defines such facts and properties.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,authorship|conception|copyright|dualism|feminist jurisprudence|fixation|innovation|intellectual property|materiality|mental steps|patent|patriarchy|Preprint|reduction to practice|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:05.622152,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T04:13:01.019000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/citation/,jhcym,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/r3b88/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/relationships/node/,r3b88,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5789b44e594d9001ef859f53/,5789b44e594d9001ef859f53,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jhcym/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jhcym/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jhcym

This article illustrates how information ethics might apply to legal doctrine, by examining legal questions related to the ownership and control of the personal data representations, including photographs, game avatars, and consumer profiles, that have become ubiquitous with the proliferation of information and communication technologies. Recent controversy over the control of player performance statistics in ""fantasy"" sports leagues provides a limiting case for the analysis. Such data representations will in many instances constitute the kind of personal data that information ethics asserts constitutes an information entity. Legal doctrine in some instances proves sympathetic to such an assertion, but remains largely inchoate as to which data might constitute a given information entity in a given instance. Neither is information ethics, in its current state of development, entirely helpful in answering this critical question.

provisions to the Indian copyright law with the objective of providing
“adequate” protection for copyrighted material in the online digital
environment. Film industry was one of the biggest lobbying groups behind
the new DRM provisions in India, and the industry has been consistently
trying to portray online piracy as a major threat. The Indian film industry
also extensively uses John Doe orders from the high courts in India to
prevent the access of Internet users to websites suspected to be hosting
pirated material. This paper explores two questions in the context of the
new DRM provisions in India: (1) Is online piracy a threat to the
Indian film industry? and (2) Are the present measures taken by the film
industry the optimal measures for addressing the issue of online piracy?
Based on data from an extensive empirical survey conducted in India, this
paper questions the claims of the industry that online piracy is at a
substantial level in India. The Internet usage related data in India also
support the findings from the empirical survey. However, the paper observes
that pirated Indian movie content is abundant in the Internet and this
shows the existence of strong demand for those content. Based on a careful
analysis of different websites hosting pirated Indian movies, the paper
illustrates that the most probable consumers of those pirated
movies are the millions of (potential) consumers residing abroad. The paper
argues that the enactment of DRM provisions under Indian copyright law or
wide sweeping John Doe orders may never be a solution for such piracy.
Piracy of Indian movie content abroad is primarily attributable to the
failure of the Indian film industry to explore innovative business models
to reach (potential) consumers abroad. The paper argues that the Indian
film industry may achieve sustainable solutions for online piracy only by
making the legitimate products reach those consumers.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:30.570330,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T02:06:41.554000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/citation/,cz32p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/96cc6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/relationships/node/,96cc6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/578996b29ad5a101f3f5c3d7/,578996b29ad5a101f3f5c3d7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cz32p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cz32p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cz32p

He reads the two processes against each other as a prelude to recommending Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) reform. The amendment to FOIA that Professor Levine proposes would open the international IP policymaking process to greater public scrutiny by creating a qualified public right to ""foreign relations"" national security information, which was systematically withheld from the public during the ACTA negotiations. This article, prepared for the Cardozo Arts and Entertainment Law Journal's 2012 Symposium, ""Piracy and the Politics of Policing: Legislating and Enforcing Copyright Law,"" is a response to Professor Levine that draws on Jürgen Habermas' discourse theory of procedural democracy to examine the policymaking dynamics of ACTA and SOPA/PIPA and to assess the democracy-enhancing potential of the FOIA reform Professor Levine proposes.

The most widely publicized form of graduated response is a ""three strikes and you're out"" model, in which a user's Internet access is suspended or terminated by his or her ISP following that user's receipt of three successive notices of copyright infringement. As it has been presented by entertainment industry trade groups, the enforcement paradigm embodied in graduated response forgoes litigation and statutory mandates in favor of voluntary cooperation between rights owners and Internet access providers - parties that have long been at loggerheads with each other in the war on piracy.

This article seeks to explain, in the context of evolving network management technology and its impact on intermediary liability rules, why the time may be ripe for broadband providers and corporate rights owners to renegotiate their respective roles in the project of online copyright enforcement. Following an analysis of the turn to private ordering and technology-based mechanisms for policing copyrights online, this article proposes a set of principles to guide the implementation of graduated response regimes so that consumers, who have come to rely on uninterrupted Internet access for everything from banking to blogging, do not fall victim to immature filtering technologies and overzealous enforcement.

Such analyses have increasingly focused on property based theories of the firm, including intellectual property. In previous work we have discussed the application of this model to patents, copyrights, and trade secrets. Here we take up the theory of the firm with regard to trademarks, which act as signals of firm reputation, and so have application and effects that differ substantially from other forms of intellectual property. Using the framework from our previous analyses, we examine the propensity of trademarks to lower transactions costs between firms, as well as within firms, suggesting that such doctrines will have significant effects on the size and structure of the firm.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:47:30.749202,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-07-16T00:06:04.801000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8py6w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8py6w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8py6w/citation/,8py6w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8py6w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kh28a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8py6w/relationships/node/,kh28a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8py6w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57897a6eb83f6901f3c06369/,57897a6eb83f6901f3c06369,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8py6w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8py6w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8py6w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8py6w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8py6w
