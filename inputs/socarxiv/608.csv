While much social network analysis focuses on static relationships between actors, there is also a rich tradition of work extending back to foundational studies in network science focused on the notion that network change is an indelible aspect of social life for human and non-human actors alike (e.g., Bott, 1957; Heider, 1946; Newcomb 1961; Rapoport, 1949; Sampson, 1969). Today, social network researchers benefit from this history in that a host of methods to collect and analyze such dynamic network data have been developed.

I argue that the structural analysis method first developed by French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss provides a powerful tool to deconstruct and critique sociological theories. I propose that this method can be used to redefine certain theories not as sets of proposals from which testable hypotheses are to be derived, but rather as different versions of foundational narratives of Western society. Viewed in this way, sociological theorizing contributes to construct the Western cosmology – the body of tales and narratives that explain the creation of the social world, its relationship with nature, and its future direction.
As a case in point, I argue that the narrative of ecological modernization can thus be analyzed and deconstructed using the same tools Lévi-Strauss uses to make sense of native American cosmologies. Doing so, I find that the narrative of ecological modernization developed as a mirror image of older tales of modernization, closely associated with the myth of progress – according to which Western society emerged from a state of nature in which no rational division of labour and no private property existed. This inversion transforms the myth of creation at the heart of the modern Western cosmology into a utopian narrative that finds considerable political traction with a certain part of the business elite and associated organic intellectuals, interested in maintaining existing relations of production and power.",TRUE,FALSE,Ecological modernization|Environmental sociology|Myth|Nature|Sociological theory,2018-07-02T11:06:47.652759,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-14T21:48:22.885636,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/citation/,3pwab,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5qthx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/relationships/node/,5qthx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/59921a20b83f6902730ec5cc/,59921a20b83f6902730ec5cc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3pwab/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3pwab/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3pwab,NA

First, I’ll situate the case in theories on interracial love and marriage. Second, I outline my data and analytic approach. Following this, I focus on my findings. I show how the women talked about the base through the lens of childhood nostalgia. This is important to understand to contextualize their views of US servicemen and provide the backdrop from which these relationships were formed. Next, I show how they draw on love myths to frame their relationships and draw symbolic boundaries around their own relationship and others that may seem similar.  Finally, I discuss how they further embraced their familial roles of wife and mother. Being legally or informally married to a US serviceman shapes a woman’s role in her family.

Such analytical strategies, exemplified here by field theoretical approaches, center art objects and their movements in and across markets, where binaristic visions of art worlds do offer significant leverage. But when the analyst moves away from markets for art objects and looks to artistic practices the binaristic lens provides, at best, a blurred image with meaningful blind spots. This article suggests an alternative vision of artistic practice – one based on gravity rather than polarity – that captures the ways individuals and their actions make sense in a specific universe of meaning without forcing them into fundamentally competitive and economistic relationships. It leverages findings enabled by a unique sampling strategy in a four year study of visual artists in the United States to illuminate some limitations of binary theoretical frameworks, and outlines a generative alternative to dualism that promotes new analytical and theoretical directions for sociological analyses of artists and artistic practice. This alternative model provides new leverage on three persistent issues in analyses of artistic work: cultural change in occupational fields; actors’ attempts to manage overlapping but incommensurate forms of recognition, reputation, attention, and success; the persistent hegemony of markets for objects in both vernacular and sociological understandings of artistic practice; and questions of visibility and legitimacy central to understanding boundary formation and boundary work in creative fields. The gravitational metaphor promotes a distict set of strategies for the study of artistic work as well as other nontraditional occupations.",TRUE,FALSE,#socarxiv,2018-07-02T11:06:47.315221,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-13T18:06:42.700061,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cab|Arts and Humanities|Fine Arts|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cca|Arts and Humanities|Art Practice|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/citation/,h3esx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5fyas/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/relationships/node/,5fyas,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/599093b16c613b025af43a62/,599093b16c613b025af43a62,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h3esx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h3esx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h3esx,https://doi.org/10.3384/cu.2000.1525.191217a

On college campuses, this pressure has been formalized into affirmative consent policies that require all students to actively seek consent from their sexual partners through unambiguous verbal or physical signals. This study uses data from 25 semi-structured interviews to explore how undergraduate men make sense of sexual consent after cultural and organizational pressure to be more proactive in preventing sexual assault. Participants answered questions about their recent sexual experiences and their attitudes toward campus sexual consent policies. Findings indicate that while participants understand and condone key elements of sexual consent, they do not consistently apply reliable strategies to ensure that their sexual interactions are consensual.

Rimmer, Matthew (Ed.) (2015) Indigenous Intellectual Property: A Handbook of Contemporary Research. Research Handbooks in Intellectual Property. Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, UK and Northampton, Mass.

This Handbook considers the international struggle to provide for proper and just protection of Indigenous intellectual property. Leading scholars consider legal and policy controversies over Indigenous knowledge in the fields of international law, copyright law, trademark law, patent law, trade secrets law, and cultural heritage. This collection examines national developments in Indigenous intellectual property from around the world. As well as examining the historical origins of conflicts over Indigenous knowledge, the volume examines new challenges to Indigenous intellectual property from emerging developments in information technology, biotechnology, and climate change.

Taking an interdisciplinary approach unmatched by any other book on this topic, this thoughtful Handbook considers the international struggle to provide for proper and just protection of Indigenous intellectual property (IP).

In light of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2007, expert contributors assess the legal and policy controversies over Indigenous knowledge in the fields of international law, copyright law, trademark law, patent law, trade secrets law, and cultural heritage. The overarching discussion examines national developments in Indigenous IP in the United States, Canada, South Africa, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, and Indonesia. The Handbook provides a comprehensive overview of the historical origins of conflict over Indigenous knowledge, and examines new challenges to Indigenous IP from emerging developments in information technology, biotechnology, and climate change.

Practitioners and scholars in the field of IP will learn a great deal from this Handbook about the issues and challenges that surround just protection of a variety of forms of IP for Indigenous communities.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a trade agreement, which seeks to regulate copyright law, intermediary liability, and technological protection measures. The United States Government under President Barack Obama sought to export key features of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998 (US) (DMCA). Drawing upon the work of Joseph Stiglitz, this paper expresses concerns that the TPP would entrench DMCA measures into the laws of a dozen Pacific Rim countries. This study examines four key jurisdictions—the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—participating in the TPP. This paper has three main parts. Part 2 focuses upon the takedown-and-notice scheme, safe harbours, and intermediary liability under the TPP. Elements of the safe harbours regime in the DMCA have been embedded into the international agreement. Part 3 examines technological protection measures—especially in light of a constitutional challenge to the DMCA. Part 4 looks briefly at electronic rights management. This paper concludes that the model of the DMCA is unsuitable for a template for copyright protection in the Pacific Rim in international trade agreements. It contends that our future copyright laws need to be responsive to new technological developments in the digital age—such as Big Data, cloud computing, search engines, and social media. There is also a need to resolve the complex interactions between intellectual property, electronic commerce, and investor-state dispute settlement in trade agreements.",TRUE,FALSE,Copyright Law|Digital Rights Management|electronic commerce|Electronic Rights Management Information|intellectual property|Intermediary Liability|international trade|investor-state dispute settlement|Safe Harbours|Takedown and Notice|Technological Protection Measures|Trans-Pacific Partnership,2018-07-02T11:06:46.883665,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-12T14:00:33.012361,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c29|Law|International Trade Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c53|Law|International Law,Matthew Rimmer,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/citation/,6vx3w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zdupv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/relationships/node/,zdupv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598f0871b83f690253e24f19/,598f0871b83f690253e24f19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vx3w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vx3w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vx3w,NA

Summary statistics are helpful and important for evidence synthesis and decision making. However, they can be unstable and inconsistent due to diversity in research designs and variability in analytical specifications. They also mask the dynamics of individual responses to a certain intervention by focusing on average treatment effect on the treated, even though the variation in impact may be crucial information for policy makers. To establish stability and consistency of impact estimates and to reveal the dynamics of individual responses in RCTs, we conduct variable selection, harness the power of noise, implement Cumulative Quantile Analysis (CQA), and devise umbrella plots of loss and gain in this study, using real datasets from over 30 educational interventions funded by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) in England. For the purpose of comparison, which is essential in data visualisation, all the aforementioned methods are built upon multiple analytical approaches. We show that the importance of an intervention can be ordered through variable selection, and that the power of noise or the bias induced by inappropriate variables, can be utilised to assess the stability of an impact estimate. We also demonstrate that estimates of average treatment effect cannot fully capture the impact of an intervention on sub-groups of participants with varying levels of attainment at baseline, not to mention individual responses to the intervention. Using CQA and umbrella plots, we are able to supplement what common effect size estimates lack in educational interventions. We argue that the impact of an intervention is often more complex than the average treatment effect suggests, and that until a summary is more informative and able to speak directly to the eye, evidence-based policy and practice cannot be fully achieved.",TRUE,FALSE,Effect size|Evidence|Impact|Noise|RCT|Visualisation,2018-07-02T11:06:46.479884,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-08-11T17:47:28.113633,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/citation/,e4prv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/96sr7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/relationships/node/,96sr7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/598debf8594d900047a9fb15/,598debf8594d900047a9fb15,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4prv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e4prv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e4prv,NA
