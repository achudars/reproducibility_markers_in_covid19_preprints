Evaluating framings and narrations of risk governance in marine radiation after the Fukushima nuclear accident","This chapter explores the narration of risk in marine produce from Iwaki in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. The release of radioactive matter into the Pacific Ocean following the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in north-east Japan is the largest-ever accidental marine pollution incident. In Fukushima, this has affected coastal communities for whom fishing is economically, socially and culturally significant. We explore the interplay between two different narratives around radiation risk in marine produce. One concerns dispelling ‘harmful rumours’ around safety of marine produce, claiming that as marine radiation can be known and controlled, raising concerns over safety is harmful to the recovery of affected locales. The second is an alternative narrative emerging from local-level actors (municipal government, fisheries cooperatives, NGOs) focused on the inherent uncertainty associated with complex coastal ecosystems. Transparency and participation in data collection act to develop collective understandings of an ‘acceptable’ level of uncertainty. Drawing on field research from Iwaki, we illustrate that while these two narratives are distinct, they are by no means polar opposites. Common to both are wider questions about trust in the people and institutions producing knowledge about water and about what can be known with certainty in water environments.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-06-25T00:41:44.105903,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-25T00:41:11.866928,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzgjx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzgjx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzgjx/citation/,dzgjx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzgjx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzgjx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzgjx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d49a70f3885800859dc5c3/,60d49a70f3885800859dc5c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzgjx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzgjx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dzgjx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dzgjx/,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003030171-4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dzgjx

Using data on paid parental leave preferences from 35,488 adults situated within 26 different OECD countries, and multilevel modeling, this study examines public opinions about the provision of paid parental leave, some government funding of leave offerings, and preferred lengths of leave offerings. We consider how attitudes may be similar or different across social contexts and then focus upon the extent to which gender, gendered parenting role attitudes, family strains, and country-level institutionalized leave offerings are associated with leave preferences. The findings indicate that the vast majority of respondents are in favor of rather widespread and generous paid parental leave offerings; indeed, there are generally high levels of support for paid leave availability, relatively long paid leave offerings, and government funding of leaves. Gendered expectations and family strains are consistently associated with individuals’ leave preferences—even after accounting for country-level social contexts. Country-level offerings are also associated with leave preferences-- yet we find that the overwhelming majority of respondents express a desire for paid parental leave length offerings that are substantially different than the extant leave offerings in their country. Overall, this research complements previous work by newly documenting widespread public support for the provision of paid leave and some government funding of it. Also, it establishes that gendered expectations, family strains, and country-level practices are consistently associated with paid parental leave preferences in wealthy countries. Yet, substantial dissatisfaction with extant paid leave policies within countries seems to be commonplace.",TRUE,FALSE,family policy preferences|family strains|gendered expectations|parental leave,2021-06-24T14:08:41.234373,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-24T14:08:15.540393,FALSE,NA,no,Data available at: http://www.issp.org/data-download/by-year/,,no,,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmby8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmby8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmby8/citation/,pmby8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmby8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmby8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmby8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d47fb407e96e0076189856/,60d47fb407e96e0076189856,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmby8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmby8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmby8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pmby8/,https://doi.org/10.1177/00207152211026705,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pmby8

A review of dating apps and their key features,"Background: Dating apps are an increasingly popular way that people use to meet each other for sex and relationships.
Objective: This study aimed to explore the key features of popular dating apps in terms of the ways they construct relationships. To achieve this, we describe key dating app features, we then compare these features across different user populations that are targeted by the dating apps, and finally we conduct an exploratory cluster analysis to determine specific types of dating apps, irrespective of the target populations who use the dating apps. 
Methods: We applied a systematic review approach to the top downloaded dating apps in 2016, and examined how the final study sample (n=259 dating apps) constructed and organised sexual relationships. We extracted data on a range of dating app features that allowed the user to present themselves and specify what they are seeking in a relationship or in a partner. To ensure the enduring applicability of our findings, we updated our search in 2021 and found that the majority of 2021-popular dating apps were included in our 2016 study sample.  
Results: Most dating apps were designed for a broad target population, while 42% of dating apps were aimed at niche targets, which we categorised into i) sexualised, ii) social identity, and iii) individual features. Key dating app features and associated relationship types differed significantly across all target populations. Irrespective of target population, we identified two dating app types in our exploratory cluster analysis. These dating app types were either a) ambiguous and vague, with relationship terminology being unclear and open to interpretation (e.g. ‘love’) or b) clear and direct, using key terminology that ensured that matched users shared an understanding of relationship types (e.g. ‘marriage’ or ‘sex only’). 
Conclusions: The top downloaded dating apps are designed for broad user populations, and therefore organise relationships in a way that is purposefully applicable to all users. This is likely to impact on matched users in terms of incongruent expectations of relationship nature, longevity and values, and may therefore affect mental health, psychological wellbeing and sexual risk taking.",TRUE,FALSE,dating apps|Sex partner|sexual health|sexual relationships|systematic review,2021-06-24T13:59:40.925074,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-24T13:59:28.439987,FALSE,NA,no,"We conducted a systematic review on the top downloaded dating apps via a digital platform: AppAnnie in 2016.

Given the high number of psychotropic medications prescribed to the veteran population, it is salient that any relationship between veteran suicide and antidepressants be explored. Method: A preregistered systematic review was conducted of empirical studies from 1988-2018. Studies were identified through electronic bibliographic databases. Results: A total of 25 studies met eligibility criteria. Studies reviewed only minimally explored adverse effects of antidepressants. Conclusion: Rigorous evidence is urgently needed, but lacking. Further research will need to explore the frequency of adverse effects (e.g. suicidality, aggression, akathisia) among veteran users of antidepressants.",TRUE,FALSE,adverse effects|antidepressants|mental helath|suicidality|suicide|Veterans,2021-06-25T20:11:41.670170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-25T20:11:09.785021,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/bydfa,available,NA,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=118017,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wym4g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wym4g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wym4g/citation/,wym4g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wym4g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wym4g/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bydfa/,bydfa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wym4g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d37ea98a8b57000dbc77c7/,60d37ea98a8b57000dbc77c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wym4g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wym4g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wym4g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wym4g/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wym4g

We provide a framework to highlight the key concepts and properties of the different estimators. We then show how these measures relate to one another empirically. Our main analysis uses income tax data from Australia to produce a comprehensive set of empirical estimates for each of 19 different mobility measures at both the national and regional level. We supplement this analysis with other data that uses either within or between country variation in mobility measures. A key finding is that there is a clear distinction between relative and absolute measures both conceptually and empirically. A region may be high with respect to absolute mobility but could be low with respect to relative mobility. However, within broad categories, the different mobility measures tend to be highly correlated. For rank-based estimators, we highlight the importance of how the choice of the distribution used for calculating ranks can play a critical role in determining its properties as well as affect empirical findings. These patterns of results are important for policy makers whose local economy might fare well according to some mobility indicators but not others.

Scholars have approached these practices largely from the point of view of the history of electricity rather than the broader history of energy. While it is true that these practices facilitated the expansion of the industry, this paper argues that electrical systems and the calculations around them were also used to ‘decipher’ the new relations between power, economic change, and society emerging in the first decades of the twentieth century. This paper asks how electricity took on the form of a mode of representation of economic life. Starting from the control of currents in early electrical systems via the calculation of voltage, current, and resistance, the paper shows how load management developed, and how the calculations around the large, interconnected power systems of the early twentieth century were used as information on the ‘power economy’. In the medium of the power economy, engineers, economists, and politicians imagine the relation between the national and the world economy, between technical progress and the nascent macroeconomic object of ‘the economy’. The paper distinguishes two ways in which calculations around electricity become relevant for economic policy: as an indicator of economic growth and as the ground for a new economy.",TRUE,FALSE,economic statistics|electricity|energy history|formalization|history of economic thought|history of technology|power economy|quantification,2021-06-24T13:45:45.731229,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-06-24T13:45:17.910303,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd1|Arts and Humanities|History|Intellectual History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6a29c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6a29c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6a29c/citation/,6a29c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6a29c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6a29c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6a29c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60d3484173c72e011dc3c313/,60d3484173c72e011dc3c313,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6a29c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6a29c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6a29c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6a29c/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6a29c
