We argue that governments which have historically repressed internal dissent are more likely to adopt policies in response to the pandemic which are observationally equivalent to those that they would use to limit domestic dissent --- in particular policies that restrict citizen's freedom of movement --- compared to countries that have not. Empirically, we find that governments that have recently engaged in state violence against civilians have been more likely to enact lockdown and curfew policies, have done so earlier in the pandemic, and have implemented these policies over a longer time period.

social reasons. Plant-based meat substitutes have been identified as healthy sources of protein
in comparison to meat. This alternative o?ers several social, environmental and health benefits
and may play a role in reducing meat consumption. However, there has been a lack of research
on how specific meat substitute attributes can influence consumers to replace or partially replace
meat in their diets.
Research demonstrates that in many countries consumers are highly attached to meat.They consider
it as an essential and integral element of their daily diet. For these consumers which are
not interested in vegan or vegetarian alternatives to meat, so-called meathybrids could be a lowthreshold
option for a more sustainable food consumption behaviour. In meathybrids only a
fraction of the meat product (e.g. 20% to 50%) is replaced with plant-based proteins.
In this paper, the results of an online survey with 500 German consumers are presented with focus
on preferences and attitudes relating to meathyrids. The results show that more than fifty percent
of consumers substitute meat at least occasionally. Thus, about half of the respondents reveal an
eligible consumption behaviour in respect to sustainability and healthiness to a certain degree.
Concerning the determinants of choosing either meathybrid or meat it becomes evident that the
highest e?ect is exerted by the health perception. The healthier meathybrids are perceived, the
higher is the choice probability. Thus, this egoistic motive seems to outperform altruistic motives
like animal welfare or environmental concerns when it comes to choice for this new product

Up to now, there is limited research addressing the implications of a joint CE framework following the China-EU agreement. Based on 72 expert interviews, 52 documents and participant observation, we study political narratives around the Chinese Waste Ban (WB) to understand China and EU’s visions for a global CE. Our results reveal a political gridlock in China-EU coordination regarding the WB as the two political actors are not yet synchronized regarding their waste management visions and are mentally unprepared to cooperate on international CE development. Both rely on old development and trade discourses, have diverging CE visions and conflicting perceptions of their respective waste governance roles, as well as prioritize differing scales for international CE development. Based on these results, we suggest CE stakeholders to reevaluate the EU and China’s mutual narratives and related agencies. Most importantly, we argue that decision-makers need to reimagine their roles beyond a linear development model, and to focus on waste prevention instead of waste diversion.",TRUE,FALSE,China|circular economy|development|European Union|Waste Ban|waste trade,2020-11-10T10:13:00.663420,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-10T10:12:48.383018,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyw5g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyw5g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyw5g/citation/,uyw5g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyw5g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyw5g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyw5g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5faa445c91419d019866d9b6/,5faa445c91419d019866d9b6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyw5g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyw5g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyw5g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uyw5g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uyw5g,NA

The concept of niche construction, whereby organisms actively construct their environments and change the conditions for selection, could provide a solution to this problem. In this review, we evaluate the utility of niche construction theory (NCT) for stone tool archaeology. We apply NCT to lithics both as part of the ‘extended phenotype’ and as residuals or precipitates of other niche-constructing activities, suggesting ways in which archaeologists can employ niche construction feedbacks to generate testable hypotheses about stone tool use. Finally, we compare NCT to other prominent evolutionary approaches, such as human behavioral ecology and dual-inheritance theory, concluding that NCT has several advantages.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeological theory|cultural evolution|Extended Evolutionary Synthesis|human evolution|Lithics,2020-11-10T00:57:02.405408,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-10T00:56:19.335037,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yk5cd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yk5cd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yk5cd/citation/,yk5cd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yk5cd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yk5cd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yk5cd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa9ce5991419d018066a390/,5fa9ce5991419d018066a390,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yk5cd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yk5cd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yk5cd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yk5cd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yk5cd,https://doi.org/10.1002/evan.21881

Public face masking policies, however, were only endorsed by a few countries in eastern Asia until recently. Herein, we review the theory and evidence behind public face masking and social distancing. We find a complete absence of adequate randomized trials for social distancing and only a few for public masking, but similar levels of evidence that both interventions could work to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Given the similar levels of evidence, it is strange that social distancing was promoted in the absence of public face masking policies, particularly so with the detrimental emotional, social, and economic side effects that social distancing entails.

Using exogenous variation driven by the platform's daily newsletter, we find that that the product gender gap shrinks on days when women are more likely to engage with the platform. Conversely, entrepreneurs who happen to launch a female-focused product on an especially male-dominated day reduce their product development efforts by roughly 30% and are 4 percentage points less likely to raise venture funding.

This underlines their vital role in public health crisis. Studies of narrative in health crises have negatively assessed the overall impact of warfare rhetoric, judging according to discrepancies between projected and achieved outcomes. Yet the warfare narrative dominated the framing of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Through a historical alignment of Christian, military and national virtues, the warfare narrative provided a guiding framework for collective response to crisis, simultaneously hoping to reassure and ‘bring the Nation together’. The narrative, however, polarised British society, accentuating divisions and exacerbating political tensions coinciding with the pandemic. This article analyses the implications and effects that Covid-19 war narratives had on public life, and what their usage tells us about effective science communication in a crisis.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Health and Media|health communication|metaphors|public understanding of science|science and religion|science communication|Science Narratives,2020-11-10T00:59:21.772326,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-10T00:58:40.732638,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,Franziska E Kohlt,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z5s6a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z5s6a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z5s6a/citation/,z5s6a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z5s6a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z5s6a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z5s6a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa98ad49c7a4e014fa01940/,5fa98ad49c7a4e014fa01940,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z5s6a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z5s6a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z5s6a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z5s6a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z5s6a,NA

While GIS is generally used to refer to software applications created to manage geographic information, in truth GIS are also defined by other key components such as the spatial data being analysed, the hardware and the human component defined by users’ training, experience and decisions (Ballas et al., 2018). All these are key parts of what is known as GIS, and it is why many argue that GIS should be described in terms of a conceptual and methodological framework rather than software in isolation. As such, researchers have developed an academic discipline, Geographic Information Science, aimed at examining and developing data organisation models and computational mechanisms for GIS, including geovisualisation and spatial analysis techniques (Goodchild, 2009).",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-10T01:00:00.873341,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-10T00:59:46.875079,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,David Buil-Gil and Samuel H.

The government currently engages with variety of stakeholders – including the private sector, civil society, state actors, and intergovernmental organizations – across multiple fora and organizations. Rather than being a passive participant, the Netherlands has been a catalyst, driving change in the field of cyber security both domestically and internationally. Yet, the challenge which lies ahead for the Dutch government is to make sure their cyber efforts as a whole will become greater than the sum of its parts. It will require increased coordination and collaboration across initiatives to turn the current patchwork into a synergistic endeavor. Our argument is presented in four parts. The first part provides an overview of the national cyber security strategies published since 2011. It also addresses which key terms have been defined by the Dutch government. The second part discusses the Dutch government’s views on sovereignty, international law and international cooperation. Part three analyzes the role of the private sector in the Netherlands. The final part concludes.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-11-10T01:01:04.933379,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-10T01:00:19.265311,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Affairs|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy",Routledge,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p284/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p284/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p284/citation/,6p284,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p284/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p284/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p284/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa911d2d1894f013e68b495/,5fa911d2d1894f013e68b495,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p284/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p284/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p284/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6p284/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6p284,NA
