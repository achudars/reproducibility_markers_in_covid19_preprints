Race is assumed to be self-evident, and merit is no exception. Merit’s reality is not questioned as it is something that is obvious and identifiable within an academic evaluative culture. While scholars note that the definitions of merit reflect the societal elite's cultural norms and definitions of merit transformed to justify racial hierarchies in the U.S., scholars have seldom questioned the racial assumptions upon which these merit transformations take place. Specifically, what have the transformations in merit within the U.S. academy had to presume about race, its role in the social world, and how it operates within the U.S. academy? Conducting a knowledge culture analysis of merit within the academy from 1890 until present, the study argues the contemporary academic evaluative culture has inherited a presumption of the twentieth-century academic evaluative cultures: adjudications of merit are premised upon the colonized proving their assimilability. The colonized have served as fundamental backdrop for how to judge merit because merit in academia’s social world emerged as a language and technology to manage the inclusion of racial difference; or simply, merit as race talk. This myopia makes it so academic evaluative cultures do not question whether the study of merit is the same as the colonial study of intelligence. Given this myopia, academia could begin to explore alternative bases of merit knowledge that are not dependent on adjudicating colonized communities' worth.",TRUE,FALSE,colonialism|culture|higher education|knowledge|racial theory|white supremacy,2019-12-16T03:49:20.941048,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-16T03:49:04.467644,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/citation/,9bwu5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df6a433835f3f000db402be/,5df6a433835f3f000db402be,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9bwu5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9bwu5,NA

We develop a relational understanding of how social relations, culture, and conflict are interwoven. Using this framework, we examine how combatants' associations with cultural elements affect the interpersonal relationships underlying conflict dynamics, as well as how these relationships engender associations to cultural elements. To do so, we first introduce a novel analytical approach that synthesizes computational textual analysis and stochastic actor-oriented models of longitudinal networks. We then use our approach to analyze a two-level socio-semantic graph representing both the cultural domain and social relationships of prominent militants operating in one Afghan province, Balkh, between 1979 and 2001. Our results indicate that militants' interpersonal comradeships rely, in part, on their connections to cultural elements and relative power. Comradeship, in turn, fosters militants' connections to cultural elements. We conclude by discussing how conflict studies can continue to build on insights from cultural sociology, as well as how cultural sociology and socio-semantic network research can benefit from further engaging conflict studies and developing our analytical approach. We also highlight provisional insights into endogenous mechanisms of conflict resolution and cultural change.",TRUE,FALSE,Conflict|Culture|Socio-semantic networks|Stochastic actor-oriented models|Topic Models,2019-12-16T03:48:20.961142,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-16T03:48:07.635607,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/citation/,xbjm2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df682785eb0bc000c76457a/,5df682785eb0bc000c76457a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xbjm2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xbjm2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xbjm2,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2019.101403

Using data compiled from a random sample of the 2005 one-percent mini-census of the People’s Republic of China, our analyses reveal gender-asymmetric associations between ASFR and earnings among young workers before their prime fertility age, where ASFR on average was negatively related to the earnings among young women, but not among young men. Moreover, such negative association was limited primarily to female workers in the private sector, negligible in state-owned and collective enterprises, and even reversed to positive among those working in government agencies and public institutions. Our findings suggest that employers in the private sector may use aggregate fertility to “evaluate” potential training and replacement costs and the productivity of female employees associated with maternity leave, thereby reinforcing and perpetuating stereotypes and discrimination against women in the workplace.",TRUE,FALSE,Economic sector|Gender earnings inequality|Sex composition of occupation|Statistical discrimination|Urban China,2019-12-12T20:28:20.724433,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-12T20:27:59.753997,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/citation/,kbwz4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df2926e835f3f000dafeb6a/,5df2926e835f3f000dafeb6a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kbwz4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kbwz4,NA

‘A doorway opened wide to the bounty of foods, to the multitudes of people.’

In 1884, the Kīngitanga (Māori King Movement) instituted its first punakai (uniting of food sources) to feed its people. At that time the country was ravaged by warfare, which rendered access to prime food and water scarce to followers of the Kīngitanga. King Tāwhiao, the second Māori King, established the punakai to feed the widowed, the orphaned, and the destitute, and all who mourned the loss of loved ones in the war. Later re-named poukai, this institution continues to this day.  A series of annual gatherings take place at Kīngitanga marae, the gathering places of the extended family who belong to that place, and who are responsible for each poukai. Marae pool their food resources to host the Māori King and his family, and to feed the people. The poukai is now an institution in itself with food at its very centre. We provide examples of traditional pre-European foods, as well as foods introduced after the arrival of Europeans in New Zealand. We discuss the relationships between the poukai, food and identity, and identify some of the issues that poukai marae face, as well as events and trends that have impacted and caused change. In Māori culture, mana recognises the reciprocal relationships between people, and between people and place, asserting that each has a responsibility to each other. Control over resources, and provision of traditional foods at events such as the poukai, is essential to the mana of Māori.  We discuss the cultural value that marae place on their kai and how these cultural values are impacted by change. Finally, we comment on the sustainability of these poukai, and how the poukai connect to a continuing vision of revitalisation and self-determination for Tainui.",TRUE,FALSE,Indigenous knowledge; food sovereignty; manaakitanga; Maori traditional foods; indigenous ecological knowledge,2019-12-12T17:46:23.828834,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-12T17:46:02.927575,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tz746/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tz746/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tz746/citation/,tz746,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tz746/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tz746/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tz746/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df029cb18536f000b8d1d28/,5df029cb18536f000b8d1d28,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tz746/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tz746/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tz746/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tz746/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tz746,NA

The objective of this research is to study the criminal phenomenon of looting during the social explosion of October 2019 and throughout that period. But in addition, and because they are similar social phenomena and occurred in the same geographical-human space (Chile) and in periods not so distant in time, the looting that took place during the earthquake of February 27th, 2010 (27/F) in Chile will be the object of investigation. Our theoretical option to study this criminal phenomenon will be the so-called Disaster Studies, and in particular, from what we could call a disaster criminology. We will use not only the specialized literature on disasters, but also the academic works related to the earthquake of February 27th and the journalistic literature related to the looting during the earthquake of 27/F as well as that related to the social explosion of October 2019.",TRUE,FALSE,18/O|disaster criminology|disaster studies|looting|social upsurge Chile 2019,2019-12-10T23:07:22.910856,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-10T23:06:55.736223,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyegn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyegn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyegn/citation/,cyegn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyegn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyegn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/69fvg/,69fvg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyegn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df0094318536f000c8ca1e0/,5df0094318536f000c8ca1e0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyegn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyegn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cyegn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cyegn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cyegn,NA

We use both text mining and qualitative analysis methods to ask three research questions about GoFundMe campaigns from the United States created in 2018 and 2019. First, how do campaigners on GoFundMe describe their need for personal vehicles? Second, what precipitating events led them to seek crowdfunding for a car purchase or repair? Third, what are broader contexts for these requests for financial assistance?
We find that many campaigns describe several interrelated crises, complications, or challenges that the campaigners faced, such as medical conditions, loss of employment, and housing crises. Most campaigners are without a functioning car because of an unexpected event—a car crash, a breakdown, or repairs piling up—combined with their inability to pay for the repairs or replacement. Finally, campaigners wanted cars to travel to work and school, to chauffeur children, and to access medical care.",TRUE,FALSE,car ownership|crowdfunding|qualitative analysis|transportation,2019-12-10T23:08:02.496082,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-10T23:07:45.240484,NA,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/tmvgk/,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8x7d2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8x7d2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8x7d2/citation/,8x7d2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8x7d2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8x7d2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tmvgk/,tmvgk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8x7d2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5deff451078b52000a58c42e/,5deff451078b52000a58c42e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8x7d2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8x7d2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8x7d2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8x7d2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8x7d2,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2020.07.004

Our application estimates three large sets of specifications using an original dataset which contains information on the Prime Central London housing market. We show that while posterior model probabilities may indicate a strong preference for an extremely small number of models, and while the spatial autocorrelation parameter varies substantially, median direct effects remain stable across the entire permissible spatial weighting matrix space. We argue that spatial econometric models should be estimated across this entire space, as opposed to the current convention of merely estimating a cursory number of points for robustness.",TRUE,FALSE,Data Visualisation|Model Selection|Real Estate Economics|Spatial Econometrics,2019-12-10T23:08:41.894221,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-10T23:08:33.929258,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt2yq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt2yq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt2yq/citation/,nt2yq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt2yq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt2yq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt2yq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5defe146078b52000c58f196/,5defe146078b52000c58f196,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt2yq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt2yq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nt2yq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nt2yq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nt2yq,NA
