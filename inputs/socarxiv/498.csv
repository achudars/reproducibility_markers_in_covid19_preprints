I read the book to see what I could learn about contemporary conservative thinking, especially anti-Trump conservatism. Opposing Trump and the movement he leads is suddenly the most pressing progressive issue of our time, and it’s important not to be too narrow in mobilizing that opposition.  Unfortunately, I found the book to be an extended screed against leftism with but a few pages of anti-Trump material grafted in here and there, which ultimately amounts to blaming leftism and immigration for Trump. And that might sum up the state of the anemic conservative movement. Goldberg’s own weak-kneed position on Trump is not resolved until page 316, when he finally concludes, “As much as I hold Trump in contempt, I am still compelled to admit that, if my vote would have decided the election, I probably would have voted for him” (316). In the end, Goldberg has charted a path toward a détente between his movement and Trump’s.",TRUE,FALSE,books|conservatism|immigration|politics|racism|trump,2018-07-12T03:02:45.239124,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-12T03:02:16.125450,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32n8y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32n8y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32n8y/citation/,32n8y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32n8y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f7n9x/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32n8y/relationships/node/,f7n9x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32n8y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b46c2c739cb1f001192dc33/,5b46c2c739cb1f001192dc33,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32n8y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32n8y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32n8y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/32n8y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/32n8y,NA

Using data from the 2010 Brazilian census and vital statistics from the Ministry of Health for 129 Brazilian cities, results reveal racial isolation is a strong predictor of Afro-Brazilian homicide rates, net of race-specific socioeconomic indicators and other contextual factors. Contrary to prior studies, however, this model shows racial evenness is not associated with Afro-Brazilian homicide rates.

I use administrative data to examine differences in the social gradient in the primary admission system, admitting students on the basis of their high school grade point average, and in the secondary admission system, admitting university students based on more qualitative assessments. I find that the secondary higher education admission system does not favour first-generation students; further, the system serves as an access route for low-achieving children from the privileged professional classes.

Using Denmark as a case, we investigate changes in immobility patterns for cohorts born 1960–1981 and develop a new micro-educational classification capturing both hierarchical and horizontal forms of educational differentiation. To investigate the association between parents’ and children’s educational status, we apply log linear models and control for four types of educational immobility: gradational (by returns to education), aggregated (5 macro-educational levels), horizontal (19 fields of study), and disaggregated (62 micro-educations). Our findings show that while macro-educational immobility has decreased across the period, micro-educational immobility at the university and university college levels remains high and stable, in particular for sons. We also find great variation in immobility for specific micro-educations within the university level. Studies of educational immobility would therefore benefit from paying attention to micro-educational classifications, because they capture patterns of multidimensional, disaggregated forms of reproduction.

However, load control programs are uncommon in the U.S., and it is unclear what factors are associated with consumer willingness to participate in such programs. We examine the effect of demographic characteristics and types of benefits on willingness to share static and dynamic load information with the utility and participate in a load control program. A U.S. general population survey experiment presented respondents with short descriptions of refrigerator information sharing or control, with varying descriptions of benefits (including cost incentives and environmental benefits). Willingness to participate was highest when environmental benefits were described and among younger respondents, with respondent age having the largest effect. Respondents were more willing to share static than dynamic load information. Willingness to share dynamic information and participate in load control were comparable.

Bifurcation of Private and Public Responsibilities in Criminal Punishment,"Who holds the legitimate right to punish criminals? While previous work has identified several factors that influence states’ decisions to delegate punishment duties to the private sector, it has not considered variation in the level of security required to implement the punishment. Delegating coercive power challenges commonly held assumptions about the appropriate locus of coercive power, and resistance is likely to be strongest when delegating highly secure services that require the greatest levels of physical coercion. Using data on American adult correctional facilities from 1990 to 2005, this article describes the current bifurcation of correctional contracting, wherein private contractors house increasing numbers of inmates in less secure correctional settings (e.g., low-security, community-based facilities) and public authorities retain near-monopoly control over inmates in highly secure settings (i.e., medium- and maximum-security prisons). Multinomial regression analyses reveal that states’ decisions to privatize highly secure facilities were associated with ideological and economic factors. However, the decision to privatize lower security facilities has become commonplace, and as a result has grown irrespective of state-level factors. These results suggest that handing over low-security services to the private sector has become a legitimate policy option, while privatizing the most secure services remains shrouded in illegitimacy.",TRUE,FALSE,legitimacy|private prisons|privatization|public policy|punishment,2018-07-10T11:50:22.581463,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-10T11:49:36.320873,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/citation/,bfkvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k46vt/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/relationships/node/,k46vt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/58123ccc594d9001ed3574b8/,58123ccc594d9001ed3574b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bfkvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bfkvx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bfkvx,https://doi.org/10.1080/0735648X.2016.1174619

An Analysis of Privatization and Prison Performance,"The competition thesis states that the introduction of competition from private sector service providers will spur performance improvements in previously monopolistic public sector service providers, who fear (further) delegation of their responsibilities to the private sector. This article examines the competition thesis in the context of incarceration. Using data on U.S. adult correctional facilities in 2000 and 2005, it employs a difference-in-difference strategy to compare over-time performance changes among newly competitive facilities relative to non-competitive facilities. Prison performance is measured along four dimensions (safety, order, activity, and conditions), using survey responses from prisons. The results do not show a beneficial competition effect; prisons in newly competitive states experienced performance change in ways that were statistically indistinguishable from prisons in non-competitive states. Supplemental analyses reveal this finding to be robust to most modifications to the sample and the model.

The study aligns with previous research in the area by Cole and Leets (1999) that looked at attachments formed with media figures and the correlation to level of attachments in real-life relationships. In their study, Cole and Leets (1999) used a three-dimensional attachment scale that included anxious-ambivalent, avoidant, and secure, and found those with higher insecurity or unstable real-life relationships have stronger parasocial relationships. We surveyed university age respondents and we used the same scales as Cole and Leets (1999) to examine whether in Kuwait, where dating violates social norms and looser bonds are found outside of the home, that stronger parasocial relationships with media personalities will be found because of the need to fulfill relationship needs outside of family. Our hypotheses in this chapter is that higher levels of anxious-ambivalents and avoidants both will be found due to the strict collectivist nature of the society forcing many to compensate for lack of real world relationships by forming mediated bonds. Moreover, we posited and discovered that that these two groups also showed the highest levels of parasocial relationships in our sample.",TRUE,FALSE,attachment|collectivism|Kuwait|parasocial relationships|TV,2018-07-10T11:48:46.212165,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-10T11:48:24.198316,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e14|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Broadcast and Video Studies,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/citation/,w5huy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bewj5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/relationships/node/,bewj5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4381605b38c4001168538d/,5b4381605b38c4001168538d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w5huy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w5huy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w5huy,NA
