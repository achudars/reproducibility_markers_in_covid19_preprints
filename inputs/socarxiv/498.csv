Few studies, however, investigate the role and impact of such online platforms on planning outcomes. We evaluate the impact of participant input via a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS), a platform to suggest the placement of new bike share stations in New York City (NY) and Chicago (IL). We conducted 2 analyses to evaluate how close planners built new bike share stations to those suggested on PPGIS platforms. According to our proximity analysis, only a small percentage of built stations were within 100 feet (30 m) of suggested stations, but our geospatial analysis showed a substantial clustering of suggested and built stations in both cities that was not likely due to random distribution. We found that the PPGIS platforms have great promise for creating genuine co-production of planning knowledge and insights and that system planners did take account of the suggestions offered online. We did not, however, interview planners in either system, and both cities may be atypical, as is bike share planning; moreover, multiple factors influence where bike stations can be located, so not all suggested stations could be built.

Takeaway for practice: Planners can use PPGIS and similar platforms to help stakeholders learn by doing and to increase their own local knowledge to improve planning outcomes. Planners should work to develop better online participatory systems and to allow stakeholders to provide more and better data, continuing to evaluate PPGIS efforts to improve the transparency and legitimacy of online public involvement processes.",TRUE,FALSE,bike share|co-production|crowdsourcing|PPGIS,2019-01-12T21:42:27.854191,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12T21:42:11.033572,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/citation/,mtnza,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3a4e36e8da0e001a56b2ab/,5c3a4e36e8da0e001a56b2ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mtnza/,https://doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2018.1476174,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mtnza

Past works have attributed this “openness” to deliberate government strategy or lack of capacity. Most, however, do not consider the role of private social media companies, to whom the state delegates information controls. I suggest that the apparent incompleteness of censorship is largely a result of principal-agent problems that arise due to misaligned incentives of government principals and private media company agents. Using a custom dataset of annotated leaked documents from a social media company, Sina Weibo, I find that 16% of directives from the government are disobeyed by Sina Weibo and that disobedience is driven by Sina’s concerns about censoring more strictly than competitor Tencent. I also find that the fragmentation inherent in the Chinese political system exacerbates this principal agent problem. I demonstrate this by retrieving actual censored content from large databases of hundreds of millions of Sina Weibo posts and measuring the performance of Sina Weibo’s censorship employees across a range of events. This paper contributes to our understanding of media control in China by uncovering how market competition can lead media companies to push back against state directives and increase space for counter-hegemonic discourse.",TRUE,FALSE,bureaucracy|censorship|China|delegation|information control|social media,2019-01-12T20:00:41.099219,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12T20:00:13.420560,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/citation/,wn7pr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3a2d2d804708001bf8d910/,5c3a2d2d804708001bf8d910,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wn7pr/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wn7pr

Decreasing the number of cars on the road through carpooling can mitigate many problems related to transportation, including traffic congestion, emissions, and safety. Mobile information and communication technologies (ICTs) provide communicative and financial capabilities, termed affordances; to make carpooling much more convenient. However, research has yet to distinguish the role of affordances in reaching a critical mass of drivers. This chapter showcases empirical results from an in-depth study of a carpooling app, coupled with an innovative policy pilot to provide toll road discounts for carpool trips registered with the program. 

Results from the pilot countered with a for-profit model suggest drivers require sufficient reimbursement for travel costs and coordination time, to reach a critical mass needed to support a competitive travel option. However, recruitment tactics such as paid and organic media coverage, face-to-face events and incentives, and driver-focused outreach support growth of the carpool system registration, and use. Additional studies are needed to evaluate different combinations of ridesharing affordances and transportation policies to determine whether communities can realize the benefits of a critical mass of ICT-supported carpooling.",TRUE,FALSE,affordances|autonomous vehicles|carpooling|critical mass|ridesharing,2019-01-12T20:02:41.172369,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12T20:02:15.504352,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/citation/,xqmhr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3a2c867cf3f50018b963fb/,5c3a2c867cf3f50018b963fb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xqmhr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xqmhr/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xqmhr
