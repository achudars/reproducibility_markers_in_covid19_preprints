Analysis of observations and themes suggests that campaigners used street mobilization to do two things. First, they used it to build solidarity with supporters through accessibility, use of shared social spaces, and collectively showing respect for losses. Second, they used it to protest in a way that challenged negative stereotypes and projected their power to the authorities, who could not ignore such a large and dignified mobilization. Whereas previous social psychology research on disaster communities focuses on the determinants of immediate responses of people who experienced a disaster, we show the strategic aspects to such disaster communities.",TRUE,FALSE,campaigning|disaster|disaster communities|Grenfell Tower fire|injustice|justice|silent walk|social identity|street mobilization,2020-11-16T16:09:21.038272,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-16T16:09:08.948939,FALSE,NA,no,"interview data is not being publicly shared because in the consent form that our participants signed, we guaranteed that their information will be treated as strictly confidential.

Yet, employees report that the feedback they receive on their performance is not timely and often lacks structure and clarity: this makes it difficult for them to narrow the gap between current and desired performance. However, technology can support the delivery of constructive and actionable feedback in the workplace, the sharing of knowledge using this medium supporting employee growth and development. This small-scale exploratory study piloted the use of Screencasting to deliver feedback to employees on job quality reviews.  The research addresses the gap in literature on the application of technology for workplace feedback and performance processes.  Adopting a qualitative approach and using focus groups, the research evaluated employee perceptions of screencast feedback.
Results confirm the efficacy of screencast feedback as a reusable learning resource (RLO) for sharing employee performance evaluations prompting employees to engage with and act upon same. Audio feedback necessitates a thoughtful approach on the part of the Manager or Supervisor, to the challenging task of performance evaluation.

It is a novel focal point: it runs against the grain of much everyday discussion about how technology influences human learning (and, indeed, broader repercussions for living and working). Technology in higher education has often been posed in opposition to space – seen as further undermining the importance of place with each passing year. The centrality of place-bound lectures and seminars to the learner experience is, the story goes, being rapidly supplanted by the “anytime, anywhere” provision of digitalised forms of higher education (cf Crook and Bligh, 2017). Even for higher education institutions themselves, digital networks, it is suggested, underpin strategies for escaping established place-bound identities, as universities seek to become global prestige brands – ‘located’ in international flows of information and recruitment rather than in some physical territory (cf Tierney and Lanford, 2015).",TRUE,FALSE,higher education|learning spaces|technology enhanced learning,2020-11-14T12:54:42.232557,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-14T12:54:26.282559,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5e|Education|Higher Education|Scholarship of Teaching and Learning,NA,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjx72/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjx72/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjx72/citation/,sjx72,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjx72/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjx72/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjx72/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5faf0e64efc18a0191009b00/,5faf0e64efc18a0191009b00,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjx72/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjx72/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sjx72/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sjx72/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sjx72

A growing amount of research on CTs contains measures of subjective well- being (SWB) and mental health (MH) but no attempt has been made to systematically synthesize this work.
Methods/design: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs and quasi- experimental studies, including peer-reviewed publications and grey literature (e.g. reports, pre-prints, and working papers), conducted over the period 2000-2020, examining the impact of CTs on self- reported SWB and MH outcomes.
Results: Two authors (JM and CK) double-screened 1,147 records of potentially relevant studies, finding 38 studies suitable for inclusion in our meta-analysis, covering 100 outcomes and a total sample of n=114,274 individuals. The average effect size (Cohen’s d) of 38 CT studies on our composite outcome of MH and SWB is 0.10 standard deviations (SDs) (95% CI: 0.8, 0.13) for an average time until follow-up of two years. However, there is a substantial amount of heterogeneity in the estimated effects (I-squared = 64% and 95% Prediction interval: 0.0021, 0.215). CT value, both in absolute terms and relative to previous income, are significant predictors of the effect size. We find only weak evidence that the impact diminishes over time. Four randomized controlled trials in our sample were designed to identify the spillover effects of CTs on the SWB and MH outcomes of non-recipients. Two found negative spillovers but the average effect is not statistically significant and is close to zero.
Discussion: Cash transfers significantly increase MH and SWB in low- and middle-income countries. More research on the long run (5+ years) effects is needed, as well as further analysis of the community and household spillover effects of cash transfers on MH and SWB outcomes. We encourage the inclusion of MH and SWB metrics in impact evaluations of interventions to enable the assessment of their relative cost-effectiveness at improving lives compared to cash transfers.",TRUE,FALSE,cash transfer|causal|mental health|meta-analysis|subjective well-being|systematic review|welfare,2020-11-13T22:52:21.752626,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-13T22:51:55.116839,FALSE,NA,no,Ask.,,available,NA,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=175464,prereg_analysis,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,NA,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydr54/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydr54/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydr54/citation/,ydr54,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydr54/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydr54/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydr54/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5faef50680ff8e01908d8ef1/,5faef50680ff8e01908d8ef1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydr54/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydr54/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydr54/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ydr54/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ydr54

capitalism systems and their levels of income and
compositional inequality (how the composition of
income between capital and labor varies along income
distribution). Capitalism may be seen to range between
Classical Capitalism, where the rich have only capital
income, and the rest have only labor income, and
Liberal Capitalism, where many people receive both
capital and labor incomes. Using a new methodology
and data from 47 countries over the past 25 years, we
show that higher compositional inequality is associated
with higher inter-personal inequality. Nordic countries
are exceptional because they combine high
compositional inequality with low inter-personal
inequality. We speculate on the emergence of
homoploutic societies where income composition may
be the same for all, but Gini inequality nonetheless
high, and introduce a new taxonomy of capitalist

on how to conduct qualitative data analysis, on the other hand, walks us through the step-by-step
process on how to code and understand the data we’ve collected. Although there are a few
exceptions, less focus is on transparency regarding decision-making processes in the course of
research. In this paper, we argue that scholars should create a living codebook, which is a set of
tools that documents the data analysis process. It has four parts: 1) a processual database which
keeps track of initial codes and a final database for completed codes, 2) a “definitions and key
terms” list for conversations about codes, 3) memo-writing, and 4) a difference list explaining

However, while many scholars agree about the direction of change, there is disagreement about the extent to which the Commission’s position has declined. A number of studies are skeptical, and we join this skeptical line. Our contribution is to focus on the Commission’s role as a maker of both legislative and executive rules (implementing and delegated acts). These rules are all decided under complex inter-institutional procedures. But the Commission possesses the right of initiative in all procedures. We investigate how the Commission can use this first-mover advantage to influence EU policy. We establish a framework for understanding what strategic options the first-mover advantage entails and provide a first empirical illustration with a qualitative analysis of ten selected Commission proposals.",TRUE,FALSE,European Commission|European Union|Regulatory Impact Assessment|Right of initiative,2020-11-15T23:43:20.795559,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-15T23:42:55.100572,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,NA,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc9sm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc9sm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc9sm/citation/,tc9sm,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc9sm/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc9sm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc9sm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fae9680efc18a0158007a5c/,5fae9680efc18a0158007a5c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc9sm/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc9sm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tc9sm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tc9sm/,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcms.13123,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tc9sm

India is home to a growing number of people using ICT devices; many of these people were born in the 2000s. This scenario poses significant challenges in development and parental control. We are contributing to the literature on the application of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) to social issues by examining the issue of addiction to ICT devices among pre-teenage or grade-school children in India. We adopt a case-based approach to studying ICT device usage and apply TRIZ-based methods to solve for both exploration and parental control. We present a set of innovative solution concepts for further development. Further, we propose potential developmental models that can be adopted by device manufacturers, considering the recent activism in the area.",TRUE,FALSE,addiction|developmental|ICT|mobile devices|parental|pre-teen,2020-11-13T22:45:41.543953,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-13T22:45:16.148938,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,NA,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ry8c7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ry8c7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ry8c7/citation/,ry8c7,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ry8c7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h4kcg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ry8c7/relationships/node/,h4kcg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ry8c7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fae5a6580ff8e01348da55d/,5fae5a6580ff8e01348da55d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ry8c7/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ry8c7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ry8c7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ry8c7/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ry8c7
