Tools of critical stylistics, developed by Jefferies (2010), have been used to delve into the conflict as mentioned above. The conflict in ideologies leads to gender differences, and inequalities. Patriarchs view liberal feminism and its motive as a threat to patriarchal social structure. The study reveals how women challenge the monopoly and status-quo of patriarchs to raise their voice for their emancipation and free will in matters of their life. Women in Afghanistan are the nang (pride) and namoos (honor) of their families. Men, especially patriarchs, misperceive the status and image of women as damaging their reputation if they are granted full freedom in matters and walks of life. Nila Wahdati, a liberal feminist character in the novel, challenges the stereotypical image of women as fragile, fickle, and prone to sex. She even resists and negates the imposed traditional, conservative ideology and supremacy of her father. Through the use of language, women challenge the Afghan patriarchal thinking. The novelist has manipulated verb processes to represent the patriarchal ideology of the Afghan men, while the discourse-producers utilize nouns and modifications to indicate patriarchs’ contrary thinking towards women. Linguistic tools, like nouns, pronouns, pre-modifiers, negative evaluative words, epistemic modality, and subordinate clauses, describe the conflict and challenge between patriarchal and liberal feminist ideologies.",TRUE,FALSE,,2020-07-20T17:46:23.987352,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-20T17:45:39.289873,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zpja/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zpja/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zpja/citation/,8zpja,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zpja/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zpja/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zpja/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f15cb9f6ef4400127bcb525/,5f15cb9f6ef4400127bcb525,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zpja/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zpja/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zpja/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8zpja/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8zpja,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no2.11

This was the period of the global financial crisis and recovery. It is shown that global inequality continued to decline, largely due to China’s growth that explains one-half of global Gini decrease between 2008 and 2013. Income growth of the global top 1 percent slowed significantly. The slowdown is present even after survey data are corrected for the likely underestimation of highest incomes.

This case study aimed to understand how teachers make connections between CT and subjects targeted for integration. Epistemological framing contributed new insights on why teachers connected CT in different ways to different subjects: frame shifting focused teachers’ attention on goals and activities specific to each subject. As teachers attended to a subject’s particularities, they drew upon different epistemic resources to construct their descriptions of CT. Our participants (n=6) were teachers who taught 7th-12th grade computing and mathematics as individual subjects. Qualitative coding of interview transcripts revealed that teachers' ideas about CT in computing were strongly influenced by computer programming while their ideas about CT in mathematics corresponded with familiar ways of teaching and learning mathematics. However, rather than accepting the fragmentation of CT as the price of integration into individual subjects, we propose limiting the scope when defining CT. We explain how this non-intuitive strategy can preserve the coherence of CT and how it might be used in CT professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers.",TRUE,FALSE,computational thinking|computer programming|disciplinarity|epistemology|framing|mathematics education|professional development|teacher perspective|theory,2020-07-20T17:51:28.458722,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-20T17:51:04.124848,FALSE,NA,no,,,no,NA,,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7b|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|Secondary Education and Teaching,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9b4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9b4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9b4/citation/,2q9b4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9b4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9b4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9b4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f157d8a0596f600dd7a1055/,5f157d8a0596f600dd7a1055,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9b4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9b4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q9b4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2q9b4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2q9b4,NA

In this regard, EFL readers bring to the text a wide range of experiences. Consequently, such diversity of prior knowledge influences their perception and interpretation of foreign language texts. Here comes the role of cultural schemata, which is indeed a very critical role. How do cultural differences in background knowledge influence student’s reading comprehension ability? To recognize the effect of cultural schemata on comprehension, it is essential first to understand the significant role that background knowledge plays in the reading process. Therefore, to carry out this research, a selection of reading comprehension tests was assigned for an experimental and a control group in a quasi-classroom experiment of first-year EFL students at Ibn Khaldoun University (Tiaret). While the experimental group was provided with pre-reading tasks to activate their background knowledge, the control group received no treatment. We collected data from 40 participants, and the results show that many EFL learners belonging to the control group display a lack of cultural schemata since their prior-knowledge is not activated, which may well impact negatively on their reading practices. By contrast, participants of the experimental group performed better in the comprehension test than those in the control group. In brief, there is a correlation between activating students’ background knowledge and the increase of reading comprehension ability.",TRUE,FALSE,conceptual knowledge|cultural schemata|interactive process|reading comprehension|schema theory,2020-07-20T05:14:14.757487,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-20T05:13:35.388910,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://awej.org/index.php/volume-11-2020/99-awej-volume-11-number-2-june-2020/1753-the-effect-of-cultural-schemata-on-efl-learners-reading-comprehension-ability,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gzchv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gzchv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gzchv/citation/,gzchv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gzchv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gzchv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gzchv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1521da0596f600da799bd2/,5f1521da0596f600da799bd2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gzchv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gzchv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gzchv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gzchv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gzchv,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no2.26

A qualitative research design with a semi-structured interview with twelve engineering students as the main method of data generation. The interview data were coded thematically and analysed inductively. Key theories were chosen to inform the study design and help in interpreting and understanding the study data. The study seeks to answer the following question: How did Omani engineering students respond to EMI challenges?  The data analysis and interpretation are presented according to the emergent themes and a priori themes. The identification of themes offers insights into understanding Omani students’ learning experiences through the medium of English and presenting the participants’ stories about their challenges and difficulties in college. These experiences are categorised and presented here based on the themes rather than through ascription to the individuals to which they relate.,TRUE,FALSE,coping strategies|EMI challenges|engineering programme|English medium|Omani students,2020-07-20T05:14:29.066746,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-20T05:14:05.651638,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://awej.org/index.php/volume-11-2020/99-awej-volume-11-number-2-june-2020/1752-omani-students-coping-strategies-in-an-english-medium-engineering-programme,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2cs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2cs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2cs/citation/,ug2cs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2cs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2cs/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2cs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f1520f46ef44000eabcaea1/,5f1520f46ef44000eabcaea1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2cs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2cs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2cs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ug2cs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ug2cs,NA
