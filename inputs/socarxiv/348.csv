The answer to this question reaches beyond demographics, encompassing histories of family inequality, LGBTQ identity, and social movements. Presentations of gay fathers in the media and scholarship are often skewed toward white, middle-class, coupled men who became parents via adoption or surrogacy. Yet the demographic majority of gay parents continue to have children in heterosexual unions. My dissertation research uses ethnographic and interview data to argue that contemporary narratives of gay fatherhood have prematurely dismissed gay parents who have children in heterosexual unions. The choice to exclude gay fathers via heterosexual unions can be attributed to emerging narratives of LGBTQ identity and political strategies of the marriage equality movement. The consequences of gay fathers’ disproportionate visibility have led to a stratified system of access to gay parenting resources. By identifying the mechanisms that undermine gay fathers’ diversity in the public imagination and in gay parenting community settings, my dissertation amplifies the voices of marginalized gay fathers and offers an intersectional approach to the study of LGBTQ families through a social movements framework.",TRUE,FALSE,community|family|fatherhood|gay|gender|identity|kinship|LGBTQ|normativity|sexuality|social movements|sociology|visibility,2019-07-12T23:32:26.119534,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-12T23:31:45.365152,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/citation/,e3yva,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2911e5114a42001805144e/,5d2911e5114a42001805144e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e3yva/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e3yva/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e3yva,NA

In this article, I draw on ethnographic research of a small public library in a diverse, mostly working class neighborhood in Queens, New York. I show that in addition to providing an alternative to the capitalist market by distributing resources according to people’s needs, the library serves as a moral underground space, where middle class people bend rules to help struggling city residents. Although the library occasionally replicates hegemonic ideologies about immigrant assimilation, it provides a striking example of cross-class and inter-class solidarities and resistance to the neoliberal social order.

I investigate the racial and ethnic compositions of stably integrated communities as well as the characteristics that distinguish these places. Using the information theory index (H) among stably diverse places, I identify cities and suburbs that were racially integrated between 2000 and 2010. Integrated places cluster in highly diverse, coastal metropolitan areas and almost entirely within suburbs. Moreover, integration is firmly patterned along racial lines. Reflecting the antiblack nature of segregation in the US, the rate of black-white integration remains remarkably low (10.5%), but in multiethnic communities with Asians and Latinxs, the probability of black-white integration nearly quadruples (40.1%). Several critical features of place are positively associated with integration: military and public sector employment as well as public university enrollment; new housing stock; and metropolitan political fragmentation.

We argue that gaps in representation can create a misleading perception of science and the respective topics discussed in these talks. We validate annotations from an image recognition algorithm for identifying speaker ethnicity and gender to compile a data set of 2,333 TED talks and 1.2 million YouTube comments. Findings show that more than half of all talks were given by white male speakers. While the share of women increased over time, it is constantly low for non-white speakers. Topic modeling further shows that the share of talks addressing inequalities which affect both groups is low, but increasing over time. However, talks about inequalities and those given by female speakers receive substantially more negative sentiment on YouTube than others.

First, I explain the meanings of asexuality through a review of its competing definitions and the evolving vocabulary of sexual and romantic dispositions within the asexual community. I also examine the methodological issues that have made asexuality especially difficult to research and the growth of asexuality as an identity movement in resistance to pathologizing narratives of sexual dysfunction. Next, I examine intersections between asexuality and gender, race, class, and disability, with critical attention toward the relationship between asexuality and the broader LGBTQ umbrella. I then review existing knowledge of asexual individuals’ experiences of parenting, intimate relationships, and marginalization.

According to the main argument of the study, although there have been intensive applications of various Lefebvrean conceptualizations on space for the case of Turkey, in most of the relevant scholarship, the focus has been on the spatial triad framework or its various components, rather than on a systematic and comprehensive contextualization of the theory.",TRUE,FALSE,Henri Lefebvre|literature survey|production of space|spatial triad|Turkey,2019-07-11T17:10:45.266465,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-11T17:10:28.251421,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d87|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Other Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76def|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Other Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Marxist Sociology",Husik Ghulyan,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r85v9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r85v9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r85v9/citation/,r85v9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r85v9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r85v9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zv6x5/,zv6x5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r85v9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2767461c5b4a001d9f0283/,5d2767461c5b4a001d9f0283,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r85v9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r85v9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r85v9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r85v9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r85v9,NA

We extend previous work from Europe, where weak effects were found, in two ways. First, kin effects are likely to be context-dependent and differ by the type and generosity of the welfare state, and by mortality rates. Second, it may be that the grandparent derives more benefits from the grandchild as young child than a new-born or infant. We retest this hypothesis with longitudinal data from the US and England. Both these studies follow people for a longer time so we further test whether effects of grandparenting emerge later after the birth of the grandchild. We found no evidence for these hypotheses in either setting, with the exception of English women who reported higher subjective life expectancy after becoming a grandmother. These largely null findings have implications for theories of grandparenting.",TRUE,FALSE,ELSA|Grandparenthood|HRS|Subjective life expectancy|Well-being,2019-07-12T11:08:45.994350,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-12T11:08:27.800067,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9h6a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9h6a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9h6a/citation/,p9h6a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9h6a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9h6a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9h6a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2764761c5b4a001d9f001a/,5d2764761c5b4a001d9f001a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9h6a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9h6a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9h6a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p9h6a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p9h6a,NA

This additive approach enables the reuse of previous efforts of analysis or even the merging of separate research projects, thereby making these methods more accessible and increasing the discipline’s ability to create and share content analysis capabilities. This paper proposes a weakly supervised topic analysis method that uses both a low-cost unsupervised method to compile a training set and supervised deep learning as an additive and accurate text classification method. We test the validity of the method, specifically its additivity, by comparing the results of the method after adding 200 categories to an initial number of 450. We show that the suggested method provides a foundation for a low-cost solution for large-scale topic analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,Computational content analysis|Computational social science|Deep learning|Natural language processing|Weak supervision,2019-07-11T17:13:47.886018,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-11T17:13:13.232239,NA,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/dv8gx/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfr3p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfr3p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfr3p/citation/,nfr3p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfr3p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfr3p/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dv8gx/,dv8gx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfr3p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d26fa0fa26b34001707aa13/,5d26fa0fa26b34001707aa13,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfr3p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfr3p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nfr3p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nfr3p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nfr3p,NA
