An Analysis Accounting for Changes in Racial Diversity,"A recent study by UC Berkeley's Othering &amp; Belonging Institute (Menendian, Gailes, and Gambhir 2021) came to an astonishing conclusion: Of large metropolitan areas in the U.S., 81% have become more segregated over the period 1990-2019. This finding contradicts the recent sociological literature on changes in segregation in the U.S., which has generally found that racial residential segregation has slowly declined since the 1970s, especially between Blacks and Whites. The major question then is: What accounts for this difference? This paper answers this question in two parts. First, it shows that the preferred segregation measure of the Berkeley study, the “Divergence Index” (Roberto 2015), is identical to the Mutual Information Index M (Theil and Finizza 1971; Mora and Ruiz-Castillo 2009; Mora and Ruiz-Castillo 2011), a measure that is mechanically affected by changes in racial diversity. Given that the U.S. has become more diverse over the period 1990 to 2019, it is not surprising that this index shows increases in segregation. Second, by making use of a decomposition procedure developed in Elbers (2021), the paper shows that once the changes in segregation are decomposed into components that account for the changing racial diversity of the U.S., the findings are in line with the sociological literature. Residential racial segregation as a whole has declined modestly in most metropolitan areas of the U.S., although segregation has increased slightly when focusing on Asian Americans and Hispanics.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|entropy|multigroup|segregation,2021-07-13T16:11:23.678448,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-13T16:11:04.553616,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/mg9q4/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvutw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvutw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvutw/citation/,dvutw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvutw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mg9q4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvutw/relationships/node/,mg9q4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvutw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60edba08600da502de0a543c/,60edba08600da502de0a543c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvutw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvutw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dvutw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dvutw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dvutw,NA

It is well established that intergenerational income mobility is lower in countries with high inequality, but research on trends in mobility finds conflicting results. Motivated by this uncertainty, we ask: how important are choices of specification for levels and trends in intergenerational income associations? We use Swedish data on cohorts born 1958–1977 and their parents. Varying how, when and for whom income is measured, we estimate 1,658,880 different associations (82,944 specifications across 20 cohorts). Our results reveal that model choice is an underrecognized source of variation in intergenerational mobility research. The most consistent contributor to trends is the advancement of women in the labor market, which leads to increased persistence in women’s earnings and the family income of both men and women. Depending on specification, it is possible to conclude that income mobility is increasing, decreasing, or remaining flat. Despite variability, our results are broadly consistent with the received view that the level of mobility in Sweden is high in a comparative perspective.",TRUE,FALSE,administrative data|computational robustness analysis|economic mobility|income mobility|intergenerational mobility|multiverse analysis,2021-07-12T15:42:08.875415,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-12T15:41:35.692226,FALSE,NA,no,Estimates will be made available in a linked repository at the Open Science Framework,,no,This analysis was not pre-registered,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t6/citation/,gd2t6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t6/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf992258510b0009a5a9a6/,60bf992258510b0009a5a9a6,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ec5fcd924b4002554e7d3b/,60ec5fcd924b4002554e7d3b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gd2t6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gd2t6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gd2t6,NA

Studies that examine this relationship within a country are however lacking from the literature. Using difference-in-differences estimation and data from the Socio-Economic Panel, I analyse whether children of unemployment assistance recipients have lower educational attainment after changes to eligibility criteria, benefit levels and conditionality were introduced in Germany in 2005. I find that differences in the probability to attend the academic secondary school track between children of unemployment assistance recipients and children living in families, where no benefits are claimed, increased by 13 percentage points. In part, this was driven by the introduction of means-testing that changed the composition of unemployment assistance recipients towards the more disadvantaged. However, a further worsening in the financial conditions of these already disadvantaged families following reductions in benefit criteria appear as the main driver of the observed effect. By contrast, changes in parental subjective wellbeing due to increased benefit conditionality and stigma do not appear to play a significant mediating role.",TRUE,FALSE,ALG II|benefit generosity|difference-in-differences|education|educational inequality|Germany|Hartz IV|intergenerational inequality|natural experiment|parental unemployment|policy evaluation|social mobility|unemployment assistance,2021-07-12T13:13:42.223768,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-12T13:13:13.461543,FALSE,NA,no,"In this paper, data from the German Socio-Economic Panel study is used.

Methods: We developed a study design with the intent to reach AIPs in a randomized and anonymous manner including potential illiterate respondents as well, while avoiding as much bias as possible. However, this method was developed just before the entry into force of the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), upon which important new research challenges emerged. 
Results: This paper describes the original study design developed to estimate SV prevalence in AIPs in Belgium. We discuss the impact of the GDPR on the recruitment strategy applied to conduct a survey on SV in a randomly selected sample of AIPs, the adapted approach to conduct the study beyond GDPR and lessons learned for future research on sensitive topics in hard-to-reach populations such as AIPs.

This framework helps researchers map a graphical claim about an intervention in terms of blocking causal and non-causal pathways from a demographic marker to an outcome onto mathematical claims which involve defining an intervention in terms of a probability function. Further, I propose a new type of targeted disparity which intervenes on one of two intermediate variables, and generalize this to describe an intervention that intervenes with respect to an arbitrary `intervention set'. Each of the interventions I describe can be understood as mapping onto a particular set of policy interventions, but can additionally be shown to decompose the total disparity between socio-demographic groups into cumulative pathways through a mediator. Finally, I propose a series of parametric and non–parametric estimation strategies that can be combined with machine-learning methods to estimate the disparities of interest.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-07-11T15:42:01.996242,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-11T15:41:35.537250,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyu7p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyu7p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyu7p/citation/,zyu7p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyu7p/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyu7p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyu7p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e9cbe0600da5019e0a726d/,60e9cbe0600da5019e0a726d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyu7p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyu7p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zyu7p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zyu7p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zyu7p,NA

The education system of India has succeeded to some extent in enrolling these students in accessible schools. The quality of education provided in government schools, however, still remains a matter of concern. As reflected in several studies, most students do not have grade-specific learning levels. In popular discourse teachers are held responsible for the deteriorating condition of government schools. Usually portrayed as poorly-trained, frequently absent, work-shy, hard-to-please, and occasionally corrupt, teachers are going through a kind of identity crisis in contemporary India. Thus, on the one hand, we have the “quality problem”- the learning crisis prevalent in elementary schools, and on the other hand we have the “teacher problem”- the popular perception that the performance of teachers in government schools is substandard. These two sets of problems are entangled in such a way that one cannot to be addressed without grappling with the other. This paper seeks to explore efficacy beliefs of teachers. Previous research on teachers’ efficacy beliefs suggests that teachers with high sense of efficacy are likely to perform better than teachers with low self-efficacy. The strength of efficacy beliefs is also positively correlated with students’ learning levels. The data suggest that the participants of this study feel confident of their effectiveness but they do not refer to students’ learning outcomes while evaluating themselves as teachers. The source of their efficacy beliefs lies in their familiarity with students, experience of positive behavioural change in students and their own personality traits.",TRUE,FALSE,early career teachers|elementary education|government schools|self-belief|teacher self-efficacy,2021-07-11T15:41:32.074080,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-11T15:40:56.676759,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d54|Education|Elementary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d68|Education|Educational Leadership|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7d|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|Elementary Education and Teaching|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj2uy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj2uy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj2uy/citation/,fj2uy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj2uy/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj2uy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj2uy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e94ed0600da501860a6dea/,60e94ed0600da501860a6dea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj2uy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj2uy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fj2uy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fj2uy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fj2uy,NA

Such is the gravity of the challenge, and its effect on global collective behaviour, there are calls for social media/information disorder to be designated a “crisis discipline” along with medicine, conservation biology and climate science. Scholars have generally settled for a definition of ‘information disorder’ that reveals three variants: misinformation, disinformation and malinformation. What should be of paramount importance, in the fight against information disorder, is the potential of falsehood to cause harm. This potential for harm must be the litmus test distinguishing free speech and speech that should not be free. The ‘harm principle’ proposed by John Stuart Mill is more than 150 years old and needs an upgrade for the social media age. One such upgrade is proposed by Cass Sunstein. We summarize different approaches to analysing online information disorder. We conclude that approaches which emphasize analytical and critical thinking are important but have shortcomings. When analysing complex phenomena like conspiracy theories a ‘systems’ approach is more effective to reveal root causes of information disorder, provide actionable insight and long-term solutions.",TRUE,FALSE,analytical thinking|Disinformation|Harm Principle|information disorder|John stuart mill|misinformation|systems thinking,2021-07-11T15:40:21.108245,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-11T15:40:00.729004,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf7|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Other Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Information Literacy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4a2z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4a2z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4a2z/citation/,m4a2z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4a2z/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4a2z/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf992258510b0009a5a9a6/,60bf992258510b0009a5a9a6,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4a2z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e94902600da501860a62e0/,60e94902600da501860a62e0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4a2z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4a2z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4a2z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m4a2z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m4a2z,NA
