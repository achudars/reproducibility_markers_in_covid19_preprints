National Security Agency","*Abstract: *

This case presents pressing questions regarding the executive's power to 
collect, store, and use Americans' telephony and other personal data for 
the purposes of conducting surveillance operations.

In the wake of recent disclosures revealing National Security Agency 
data collection programs, the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles and 
21 other membership and political advocacy organizations filed this 
lawsuit to challenge the NSA's collection of telephony data as an 
infringement of their members' First and Fourth Amendment rights.

In this amicus brief, experts in the history of American surveillance -- 
James Bamford, author of The Puzzle Palace; Peter Fenn, who served as 
Washington Chief of Staff for Senator Frank Church and as a staff member 
to the Senate Intelligence Committee; and Dr. Loch Johnson, who served 
as special assistant to the Church Committee chair and as staff director 
of the House Subcommittee on Intelligence Oversight -- explain the 
historical parallels between the executive surveillance programs that 
are presently coming to light and the development of abusive 
surveillance practices from the 1940s to the 1970s.

All amici were directly involved in the comprehensive review of 
twentieth-century American intelligence operations completed by the 
Church Committee in the 1970s, giving them a uniquely thorough 
understanding of these parallels.

Drawing from the experts’ extensive knowledge, the brief explains the 
clear parallels between the development and growth of the abusive 
practices of the mid-twentieth century -- when American intelligence 
agencies helped conduct politically motivated surveillance of Americans 
ranging from ordinary teachers, journalists and peace activists to civil 
rights leaders, members of Congress, and a Supreme Court justice -- and 
today’s vast surveillance programs. History shows that abusive 
surveillance does not require bad actors to grow and flourish: instead, 
it is the natural outgrowth of too much secrecy and too little oversight 
by other branches of government.

In light of this clear historical pattern, the brief argues that the 
court should carefully apply existing legal limits on the government’s 
surveillance powers to address the risks posed by the executive branch 
and the intelligence agencies’ claims to expansive power to determine 
the limits of their own activities.

In the last decade, São Paulo has witnessed a 70% decline in homicide rates, a result that policy-makers attribute to a series of crime-reducing measures implemented by the state government. While recent academic studies seem to confirm this downward trend, no estimation of the total impact of state policies on homicide rates currently exists. The present article fills this gap by employing the Synthetic Control Method to compare these measures against an artificial São Paulo. The results indicate a large drop in homicide rates in actual São Paulo when contrasted with the synthetic counterfactual, with about 20,000 lives saved during the period. The theoretical usefulness of the Synthetic Control Method for public policy analysis, the role of the Primeiro Comando da Capital as a causal mediator, and the practical implications of the security measures taken by the São Paulo state government are also discussed.

We offer the first comprehensive look at how a district judge’s 
experience affects decisionmaking in patent cases. We find that that 
there is a strong, statistically significant relationship between a 
judge’s experience and case outcome: more experienced judges are less 
likely to rule for the patentee. Notably, the relationship exists for 
rulings finding noninfringement; judicial experience had no relationship 
to the likelihood a judge would find a patent invalid. The relationship 
appears to hold across judges, rather than to be driven by the rulings 
of particular judges. Beyond individual judges, some technologies 
(biotechnology, mechanics) are associated with more patentee wins, while 
patentees are less likely to win computer hardware and software cases. 
Some district courts (Delaware, New Jersey) are more likely to find 
patents infringed. By contrast, perhaps surprisingly, we find no 
significant relationship between litigation in the Eastern District of 
Texas and a judge’s ruling for or against the patentee. Finally, we find 
that suing on multiple patents is associated with an increased 
likelihood that at least one patent will be found to be infringed.

Our results challenge what has been an implicit assumption in the 
literature and discussion that particular districts are biased in a 
particular direction, driving forum shopping. And they test for the 
first time the implicit assumption in the literature, in calls for 
specialized patent trial courts, and in the Patent Pilot Program, that 
experience with patent cases at the trial level will lead to different — 
usually assumed to be “better” — outcomes from what we see from 
generalist courts. Our results suggest that there is a difference, but 
that “better” may be in the eye of the beholder. They suggest some sort 
of learning effect among district court judges across the country, and 
that patentees benefit from litigating before inexperienced judges, at 
least on issues of infringement. Depending on the reason for this 
effect, adoption of a specialized patent trial court might help accused 
infringers but not patentees, raising broader questions about patent 
reform and how to measure the value of an expert court.

Over the last decade, the problem of orphan works — i.e., copyrighted 
works whose owners cannot be located by a reasonably diligent search — 
has come sharply into focus as libraries, archives, and other large 
repositories of copyrighted works have sought to digitize and make 
available their collections online. Although this problem is certainly 
not limited to digital libraries, it has proven especially challenging 
for these organizations because they hold diverse collections that 
include millions of books, articles, letters, photographs, home movies, 
films, and other types of works. Many items come with a complex, 
unknown, and (often) unknowable history of copyright ownership. Because 
U.S. copyright law provides for both strong injunctive relief and 
monetary damages (in the form of statutory damages of up to $150,000 per 
work infringed), organizations that cannot obtain permission often do 
not make their collections available at all.

In October 2012, the U.S. Copyright Office initiated a new study of 
orphan works and mass digitization, and has indicated that it is a 
high-priority policy issue for the office. That study, and the work that 
preceded it, has highlighted the wide array of perspectives about why 
and how to address the orphan works problem. In this article, we present 
evidence that the orphan works problem is very real and that it inhibits 
many socially valuable uses of copyrighted works by libraries, archives, 
museums and other memory institutions. We then canvass the array of 
potential solutions, and ultimately conclude that fair use, combined 
with the Copyright Office’s remedy limitation approach, are better 
approaches for addressing this problem in the United States than 
alternatives proposed elsewhere. Finally, we explore future-looking 
changes, such as the reintroduction of copyright formalities and the 
development of registries, that would reduce the number of orphan works 
in the future.

Numerous legal regimes or proposals have been devised to address the 
problem of whether or under what circumstances in-copyright works can be 
made available if the works are “orphans,” because their rights holders 
are unknown or cannot be found. A common feature is a requirement that a 
prospective user make a diligent search for the rights holder. This 
White Paper complements an earlier one on orphan work searches which 
considered who would be expected to conduct a search. The present White 
Paper focuses instead on different conceptions about what a diligent 
search might consist of. It does not offer a normative assessment of 
what “diligent search” should mean. Rather, it intends to provide 
information about various approaches to this concept to aid in reasoned

Over the past several years, policy makers and private actors have 
developed an evolving set of approaches for addressing the orphan works 
problem — a problem that arises when “the owner of a copyrighted work 
cannot be identified and located by someone who wishes to make use of 
the work in a manner that requires permission of the copyright owner,” 
preventing follow-on uses of works. These approaches usually attempt to 
address the orphan works problem by employing some threshold mechanism 
to differentiate true orphan works, to which the proposed solutions 
would apply, from non-orphaned copyrighted works. Satisfying a 
“reasonably diligent search” is one well-known formulation by which 
users can designate works as orphaned and therefore subject to a 
proposed solution, though — as this paper points out — alternative 
approaches certainly exist. Regardless of the specific formulation, the 
search for rightsholders (or conversely, the confirmation that no 
rightsholder can be located) is an integral component of almost every 
orphan works proposal. This paper examines in detail the core schemes 
for identifying rightsholders among the leading orphan works regimes and 
proposals. Although these schemes differ across many variables, three 
factors predominate: (1) who is expected to participate in the search 
process, (2) the nature and extent of the required search generally; and 
(3) specifically what types of resources, tools, registries or other 
information-sharing mechanisms are required or allowed.

This paper compares existing proposals’ approaches with respect to the 
first factor: who participates in a search? A subsequent paper will 
focus on the second and third factors.

Many works that libraries, archives, and historical societies would like 
to digitize are “orphan works,” that is, works for which the copyright 
holder either is unknown or cannot be located after a diligent search. 
Due to copyright risk if an owner later shows up, nonprofit libraries 
and similar institutions have been reluctant to digitize and make these 
works available, greatly limiting access to important cultural and 
historical information.

While a legislative fix may soon be proposed, this Article argues that 
legislation is not necessary to enable some uses of orphan works by 
nonprofit libraries and archives. Instead, U.S. copyright law’s fair use 
doctrine, which allows certain unpermissioned uses of copyrighted works, 
provides a partial solution.

Though it is an incomplete solution, fair use has some significant 
advantages over other approaches through which libraries and archives 
could make publicly beneficial uses of orphan works. Under fair use, 
there is no need to develop a licensing system, significantly reducing 
administrative and transactional costs, and eliminating socially 
wasteful license fees for works that are not on the market, and for 
which an owner is unlikely to exist. Second, fair use has the 
flexibility to accommodate change over time as libraries and archives 
discover the best ways to search for owners, preserve works, and make 
them available. Finally, allowing fair use of orphans by libraries and 
archives helps fulfill copyright’s critical purposes of promoting the 
dissemination of knowledge and supporting speech and free expression.
