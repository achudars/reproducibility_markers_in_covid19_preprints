There is, however, no systematic approach or research available that analyses the repeated failures with regard to an adequate response to an epidemic. For a better understanding of failing societal responses, we propose a framework called the ‘Epidemic Failure Cycle’ (EFC). The EFC consists of four phases: Negligence, Arrogance/Denial, Panic and Analysis/Self-criticism. These phases fit largely with the current World Health Organization pandemic influenza phases: Interpandemic, Alert, Pandemic, Transition. By utilizing the Ebola epidemic and the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic as case studies, we show striking similarities in the response to these outbreaks during both crises. Finally, we suggest three major areas to be of utmost importance for triggering and maintaining the EFC. In terms of ecology, zoonoses, supposed to be the main biological origin for virus epidemics, have been largely neglected by politicians, the media and the scientific community. Socioeconomic and cultural conditions such as harsh living and working conditions as well as conspiracy theories hinder effective preventive and counter measures against epidemics. Lastly, in terms of epistemology, the reliance on knowledge about previous outbreaks has led to slow and inadequate decisions.",TRUE,FALSE,Ebola|Epidemics|Health policy|SARS-Cov-2,2021-03-05T14:10:21.454009,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-05T14:10:10.520350,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/citation/,pbwhx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6042296b035cf704a6c80822/,6042296b035cf704a6c80822,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pbwhx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pbwhx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pbwhx,NA

Restrictions on service provision may reduce access to family planning services and increase fertility in the short term. By contrast, the economic uncertainty brought about by the pandemic and its impact on mental health and well-being may reduce fertility. These various pathways have been explored in the context of high income countries such as the United States and Western Europe, but little is known about middle income countries. In this paper we asses the impact of the COVID pandemic on fertility intentions and behaviour in the Republic of Moldova, a middle income country in Eastern Europe, using the Generations and Gender Survey. This survey was conducted partially before and partially after the pandemic, allowing for detailed analysis of individual circumstances. The results indicate that the pandemic reduced contraceptive use by 40%. Conversely couples were also 41% less likely to be trying to conceive after the onset of the pandemic, although medium term fertility intentions were unchanged. Indicators therefore suggest that in the medium term fertility intentions may not be affected by the pandemic but access to family planning services and deferring attempts to conceive may change which individuals have children and when.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Fertility|Fertility Intentions|GGP|Moldova|Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health,2021-03-05T14:11:01.492215,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-05T14:10:49.161564,FALSE,NA,no,Data available upon registration at www.ggp-i.org,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/citation/,fcqd9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6042115a67386c047161aa6f/,6042115a67386c047161aa6f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fcqd9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fcqd9,NA

Yet even when voters agree on the facts, they tend to attribute responsibility in a group-serving manner, disproportionately crediting their party for positive developments and blaming opponents for negative developments. Using original time series data, we show that partisan disagreement over U.S. President Donald Trump's responsibility for the COVID-19 pandemic quickly emerged alongside the pandemic's onset in March 2020. Three original survey experiments show that the valence of information about the country's performance against the virus contributes causally to such gaps.

However, despite the steady growth of studies that employ web and app time diaries, there is little research on their comparability with traditional paper-administered diaries that have long been regarded as the “gold standard” for measurement in time-use research. This paper rectifies this omission by investigating diary mode effects on data quality and measurement, drawing on data from a mixed-mode large-scale time diary study of adolescents in the United Kingdom. After controlling for selection effects, we find that web and app diaries yield higher quality data than paper diaries, which attests to the potential of new technologies in facilitating diary completion.

To overcome this problem, the current study (N=5200) used latent profile analysis to uncover six profiles, including two micro-communities of vaccine skeptical people that have the potential to jeopardise vaccine-led herd immunity.

Using difference-in-differences estimation and data from the Socio-Economic Panel, I examine whether inequalities in secondary school track attainment increased after the implementation of the so-called ‘Hartz IV’ reform. The findings suggest that children whose parents receive the newly created scheme ALGII instead of Arbeitslosenhilfe for unemployment assistance experienced a significant and considerable drop in their chances to attend the academic track. Changes in parents’ socio-demographic characteristics due to stricter eligibility criteria and lower household incomes as a result of lower benefit levels account for half of the observed decline. By contrast, reductions in parental life satisfaction due to increased benefit conditionality and stigma are unlikely to mediate the reform’s documented effects. Focussing on an important outcome in Germany’s highly stratified educational system, the study is hence the first to provide evidence on the intergenerational effects of Hartz IV, shedding light on the role of social security and welfare institutions in the transmission of inequalities from parents to their children.",TRUE,FALSE,|difference-in-differences|educational attainment|Germany|Hartz IV|intergenerational inequalities|parental benefit receipt|parental unemployment,2021-03-04T18:55:03.557312,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T18:54:38.804550,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/citation/,acuwn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60411ff967386c04136224d3/,60411ff967386c04136224d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/acuwn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/acuwn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/acuwn,NA

If this is true then individuals should be motivated to both observe, and copy, common social behaviours (social norms). Previous economic experiments, using the public goods game, have suggested individuals are motivated to follow social norms. However, natural selection should favour individuals whom prefer to discover and copy successful behaviours, and previous experiments have often not shown examples of success. Here we test, on 489 participants, if individuals are more motivated to learn about, and more likely to copy, either common or successful behaviours. Using the same cooperative game and instructions, we find that individuals are primarily motivated to copy successful rather than common behaviours. Consequently, social learning disfavours costly cooperation, even when individuals can observe a stable, pro-social, norm. Our results suggest that human social learning mechanisms have evolved to maximize personal success, and call into question explanations for human cooperation based on cultural evolution and/or a desire to follow social norms.",TRUE,FALSE,conformity|cooperation|cultural evolution|public goods game|social learning|social norm,2021-03-04T17:20:07.571752,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T17:19:36.725254,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ffbg79ctr,no,There was an Ethics submission that contained a rough plan of the experimental design and expected outcomes.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gtxc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gtxc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gtxc/citation/,6gtxc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gtxc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gtxc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h743z/,h743z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gtxc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604110c267386c041a61a443/,604110c267386c041a61a443,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gtxc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gtxc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6gtxc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6gtxc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6gtxc,NA

Using data from a representative survey of Londoners fielded during the height of the first wave of the pandemic (April – June 2020), we explore the scale of public support for giving police additional powers to enforce the regulations, how support for different powers changed over time, and what factors predicted support. Aside from one lockdown-specific factor, we find that even in the midst of a pandemic, trust, legitimacy and affect were the most important predictors of support for police empowerment.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-04T17:19:01.397080,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-04T17:18:40.335890,FALSE,NA,no,Data comes from MOPAC's Public Attitudes Survey and is not publicly available,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scj46/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scj46/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scj46/citation/,scj46,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scj46/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scj46/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scj46/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60410a1f67386c04136202ad/,60410a1f67386c04136202ad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scj46/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scj46/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/scj46/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/scj46/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/scj46,NA

Propensity score matching and school fixed effects models suggest that having close college-bound friends is positively associated with enrolling in college. However, Black and Latino male students are much less likely to benefit from having college-bound friends than others, suggesting that structural and cultural factors that are tied to race, ethnicity, and gender may limit the beneficial potential of friends, especially for these male Black and Latino students.
