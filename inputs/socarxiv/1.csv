The researcher was primarily concerned with three study questions. In this study, data were collected using an observation inventory, together with eight sets of performance assessments, all conceived by the researcher. A sample of 407 randomly selected students from a public university's department of educational administration took part in three quasi-experiments. The collected data were analysed using frequency counts and simple percentages. It was determined, among other things, that many higher education test-takers participate in various sorts of examination misconduct. Giraffing, copying from colleagues, exchanging scripts, discussing with peers, using microchips (little papers with answers), phones, swapping seats, handwriting on desks, using headphones, and requesting invigilators for help are all manifestations of these behaviours. It is found that test-takers' malpractice behaviours change depending on the test supervision design used. The educational assessment implications were examined in light of these findings. Examiners wishing to limit the occurrence of examination fraud and improve efficient performance assessments may utilize one or more combinations of gender separation and inter-class test sitting arrangements.",TRUE,FALSE,gender-separation|higher education|inter-class integration|malpractice|sitting pattern,2021-05-26T13:29:07.465632,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:28:41.739726,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk7q2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk7q2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk7q2/citation/,bk7q2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk7q2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk7q2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk7q2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ad88508a5d3d031b0caad4/,60ad88508a5d3d031b0caad4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk7q2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk7q2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk7q2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bk7q2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bk7q2,NA

Here, we evaluate the current geographic adjustment of the SPM using both microdata and aggregate data from the American Community Survey for 2014-2018.

However, CS potential to enable new forms of collective governance of scientific research remains largely unexplored. At least, two confronting standpoints dominate the debate around CS: from mere crowdsourcing perspectives supported by debates over cost-effectiveness of massive data collection, to more participatory views, which understand CS as a means to democratize science and challenge current academic structures. Although most accounts of CS focus on crowdsourcing participatory formats, the discussion around CS governance mechanisms that go beyond crowdsourcing models is unfolding. Understanding CS as contributing to constitute science as a commons requires specific conditions that must be met, as well as continuous reflection and discussion. This study provides a framework for exploring the commons-like formations that characterize CS approaches, as already applied in the study of commons based peer production (CBPP). This framework of commons’ qualities considers openness at the governance level, open knowledge at technological and data levels, and social responsibility and impact of CS projects. The framework was tested and informed empirically with the analysis of 5 digital mapping CS projects, to provide points of comparison and illustration. Data was gathered through web collection, based on a netnographic method. The results show that, overall, the dimensions considered prove useful to shed light on the commons-like formations that characterize CS. They further point to the interplay of several institutional, legal, and practical dimensions in constructing and governing openness in citizen science.

Against this background, how research funding may stimulate the societal orientation of scientific research has been underexplored. This paper proposes a two-fold exploratory approach both to characterize and observe societal targeting in individual researcher funding. First, stemming from literature, policy and practices, we select four key societal targeting dimensions: interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, prioritized research problems and user-oriented outputs. All these targeting dimensions of funding can potentially shape both research networks and practices towards societal goals. These dimensions may be identified in context through ex ante specifications of funding instruments, in rules and conditions for funding provision to researchers. Second, we also consider potential interactions of funding instruments, since researchers may engage with various instruments simultaneously when conducting their research. Therefore, each researcher funding configuration at a moment in time may generate bespoke shaping of research, depending on the societal targeting dimensions present and whether funding is co-used to support different research topics and activities within a researcher’s portfolio. The combination of the targeting dimensions and their potential interactions would allow for empirical exploration at different scales and in diverse settings. They expand our understanding of funding use dynamics that might shape research. This systematic perspective on funding instrument characteristics and their configurational possibilities will be relevant to assess the role of funding in research evaluation. We conclude with both policy implications of this exploratory societal targeting approach to funding and suggestions to expand it in further research.",TRUE,FALSE,Exploratory approach|Funding configurations|Funding instruments|Researchers|Research funding|Societal targeting,2021-05-26T13:25:44.862436,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:25:23.952910,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/citation/,8rdp6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ad0aa18a5d3d02eb0c7ca1/,60ad0aa18a5d3d02eb0c7ca1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8rdp6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8rdp6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8rdp6,NA

We use 35 years of restricted geo-coded NLSY 1979 and NLSY Children and Young Adults data to estimate the association between multigenerational exposure to childhood neighborhood disadvantage and subsequent adult exposure. Invoking cousin fixed effects models that adjust for unobserved legacies of disadvantage that cascade across generations, we find that families where both parents and their children are exposed to childhood neighborhood disadvantage are likely to pass on the legacy of neighborhood disadvantage to successive generations, net of observed and unobserved confounders. Second, we find a direct intergenerational neighborhood association, net of observed and unobserved confounders.

Alaskan salmonids are anadromous, meaning they live most of their lives at sea, only to return to the river in which they were spawned to reproduce— this makes them a reliable seasonal resource in this environmentally marginal subarctic landscape. Salmonids form a major part of the subsistence lifestyle of modern Native Alaskans, and archaeological evidence suggests that their ancestors experienced population booms and cultural shifts coinciding with the adoption of mass fishing techniques. This was done primarily in response to climate changes, and to sustain burgeoning populations. Analyses of salmonid behavioural patterns are therefore crucial for understanding the lifeways of past peoples in Southwest Alaska. This work outlines a GIS-based methodology for processing an open spatial dataset— the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s Anadromous Waters Catalog (AWC)— to make it suitable for use in archaeological and anthropological research. AWC shapefiles converted in this manner may be used to identify the most ecologically diverse (and, therefore, productive) anadromous waterways, and the relationship between heritage site distribution and salmon activity along the length of rivers. As a pilot study, we discuss the cultural landscape of the Yup’ik community of Quinhagak in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta, and its two active salmon streams— the Agalig (Arolik) and Qanirtuuq (Kanektok) Rivers. There appears to be a strong relationship between the presence of cultural sites associated with fishing (both historic and archaeological) near the mouths of both rivers where the salmon runs begin (the “initial lower course”, or, “ILC”). It also highlights the importance of such rivers as highways to access non-salmonid resources further inland, including hunting and plant harvesting areas. This methodology has a strong potential for assisting in the survey and characterisation of heritage sites elsewhere in Southwest Alaska.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|GIS|Open Data|salmon|Yup'ik,2021-05-26T13:24:22.754693,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:24:03.769973,FALSE,NA,no,Cultural site location is for the Quinhagak area is only available from Qanirtuuq Inc. upon application.,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology",Jonathan S.

This article, the first of its kind as far as the authors are aware, reports on an ongoing qualitative exploration of an example of contemporary human–animal interaction on the fringes of a British city: volunteer shepherding (‘lookering’). Participants are part of a conservation grazing scheme, a growing phenomenon in recent years that relies on increasingly popular volunteer programmes. The primary volunteer role in such schemes is to spend time outdoors checking the welfare of livestock. The first section of the article summarises developments in more-than-human and multispecies research methodologies, and how the challenges of exploring the non- and more-than-human in particular are being addressed.

In doing so, they face obstacles in the systemic nature of innovation processes, the uncertain and ambiguous nature of sustainability, and in reconciling their business model and strategy with social and environmental value creation. This is particularly the case for those trying to emulate the so-called ‘Silicon Valley model’, which prioritises speed to deliver on its ambitious socially significant mission, relies on high-risk venture capital financing, and encourages flexibility and curiosity on the part of employees. This article uses data gathered during an action research case study to explore whether this much vaunted model could be better aligned with sustainable development. While, in this case, we find systemic and cognitive challenges to be currently precluding concerted action on sustainability, we also identify opportunities for greater alignment. Changes in the market and financial environment promise to provide new incentives for sustainability while the use of public deliberations such as citizen assemblies could help to reduce ambiguity. Complementary application of approaches like Constructive Sustainability Assessment within companies would allow business models to be more proactively and demonstrably aligned with employee values and ambitious sustainability missions.",TRUE,FALSE,Emerging technology|responsible innovation|silicon valley|sustainable innovation,2021-05-26T13:10:43.460742,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:10:00.342306,TRUE,N.E.M.

Point-of-care tests (POCTs) to diagnose sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have potential to positively impact patient management and patient perceptions of clinical services. Yet there remains a disconnect between development of new technologies and their implementation into clinical care. With the advent of new STI POCTs arriving to the global market, guidance for their successful adoption and implementation into clinical services is urgently needed. 

METHODS
We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with professionals prior to and post-implementation of a Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae POCT into clinical services in England to define key stakeholder roles and explore the process of POCT integration. Participants self-identified themselves as key stakeholders in the STI POCT adoption and/or implementation processes. Data consisted of interview transcripts, which were analysed thematically using NVIVO 11. 

RESULTS
Six sexual health services were included in the study; three of which have implemented POCTs. We conducted 40 total interviews; 31 prior to POCT implementation; 9 post-implementation. Post-implementation data showed that implementation plans required little or no change during service evaluation. Lead clinicians and managers self-identified as key stakeholders for the decision to purchase, while nurses self-identified as “change champions” for implementation. Many identified senior clinical staff as those most likely to introduce and drive change. However, participants stressed the importance of engaging all clinical staff in implementation. While the accuracy of the POCT, its positive impact on patient management and the ease of its integration within existing pathways were considered essential, costs of purchasing and utilising the technology were identified as central to the decision to purchase. 

CONCLUSION 
Our study shows that key decision-makers for adoption and implementation require STI POCTs to have laboratory-comparable accuracy and be affordable for purchase and ongoing use.  Further, successful integration of POCTs into sexual health services relies on supportive interpersonal relationships between all levels of staff.",TRUE,FALSE,diagnostics|health services|point-of-care test|sexual health|STIs,2021-05-26T13:18:24.334500,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-05-26T13:17:26.298964,TRUE,"ADREU has received funding from binx health, Alere, Cepheid, SpeedDx, Mologic, Revolugen and Sekisui.
