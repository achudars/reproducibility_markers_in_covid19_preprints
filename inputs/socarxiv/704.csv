twenty years. While these patents are spread across all industries, a large
percentage are concentrated in the information technology (IT) industries,
and others in biotechnology. The prevalence of patents in these industries
has caused a number of people to worry about an ""anticommons"" in patent
law. Given these problems, it's a wonder companies make products in
patent-intensive industries at all.

And yet make products they do. Both my own experience and what limited
empirical evidence there is suggest that companies do not seem much
deterred by the threat of all this patent litigation from making products.

What's going on here? The answer, I think, is quite simple: both
researchers and companies in component industries simply ignore patents.
Virtually everyone does it. They do it at all stages of endeavor. From the
perspective of an outsider to the patent system, this is a remarkable fact.
And yet it may be what prevents the patent system from crushing innovation
in component industries like IT. Ignoring patents, then, may be a
""workaround"" that allows the innovation system to function in the face of
overbroad patent protection.

At the same time, ignoring patents is hardly the optimal solution. I
suggest some ways we might move towards a compromise - a robust patent
market in which inventors could get paid without the problems of holdup and
the anticommons.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:03.366624,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-24T17:40:50.110000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e72pg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e72pg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e72pg/citation/,e72pg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e72pg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sxvr3/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e72pg/relationships/node/,sxvr3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e72pg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bddc236c613b01ecd93626/,57bddc236c613b01ecd93626,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e72pg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e72pg/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e72pg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e72pg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e72pg

exclude business methods - or any technology - from the patent law. It also
rejected as the sole test of subject matter eligibility the Federal
Circuit’s deeply-flawed ""machine or transformation"" test, under which no
process is patentable unless it is tied to a particular machine or
transforms an article to another state or thing. Subsequent developments
threaten to undo that holding, however. Relying on the Court’s description
of the Federal Circuit test as a ""useful and important clue', the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, patent litigants, and district courts have all
continued to rely on the machine-or-transformation test in the wake of
Bilski: no longer as the sole rule, but as a presumptive starting point
that threatens to effectively become mandatory. In this Article, we suggest
a new way to understand the exclusion of abstract ideas from patentable
subject matter. No class of invention is inherently too abstract for
patenting. Rather, the rule against patenting abstract ideas is an effort
to prevent inventors from claiming their ideas too broadly. By requiring
that patent claims be limited to a specific set of practical applications
of an idea, the abstract ideas doctrine both makes the scope of the
resulting patent clearer and leaves room for subsequent inventors to
improve upon - and patent new applications of - the same basic principle.
Recasting the abstract ideas doctrine as an overclaiming test eliminates
the constraints of the artificial machine-or-transformation test, as well
as the pointless effort to fit inventions into permissible or impermissible
categories. It also helps understand some otherwise-inexplicable
distinctions in the case law. Testing for overclaiming allows courts to
focus on what really matters: whether the scope of the patentee's claims
are commensurate with the invention’s practical, real-world contribution.

These were driven by falling mortality rates across all age groups, but initially mostly amongst the young. Using ONS mid-year population and deaths estimates for Local Authorities for England and Wales, we show that these improvements have recently reversed. There have been especially high increases in mortality rates within the elderly, a group which we choose to focus our analyses on. In England and Wales, we estimate that there were 39,074 more deaths in the year to July 2015 as compared to the year to July 2014 (32,208 of these additional deaths were of individuals aged 80+). Exploring changes in mortality rates by 5 year age band and sex, we demonstrate that these increases have been felt everywhere geographically; in poor and affluent areas, in rural and urban areas. We explore some possible explanations for the increases and find that few individual factors on their own appear able to explain the patterns we observe. The implications of our findings are profound given what has come before them, combined with the current political climate of austerity. The size, scale and lack of spatial pattern in these changes in 2015 (particularly in comparison to previous years) suggests that something wider is occurring at the population level than simply a one-off event.

to punish accused infringers or require them to disgorge their profits. The
statute provides for damages ""adequate to compensate for the infringement,
but in no event less than a reasonable royalty."" Courts interpreting this
provision have divided patent damages into two groups - lost profits,
available to patent owners who would have made sales in the absence of
infringement, and reasonable royalties, available to everyone else.
Traditionally, patentees want to prove lost profits, because only that
measure captures the monopoly value of exclusion of competitors from the
market. As the statutory language suggests, reasonable royalties exist as a
floor or backstop for those who cannot prove that they have lost profits as
a result of infringement.

In practice, however, the lines between lost profits and reasonable
royalties are blurring. In significant part this is because courts have
insisted on strict standards of proof for entitlement to lost profits.
Specifically, patentees must prove demand for the patented product, the
absence of noninfringing substitutes, the ability to meet additional demand
in the absence of infringement, and the proportion of those sales that
represent profits. This in turn means that many patent owners who have in
fact probably lost sales to infringement cannot prove lost profits damages,
and turn to the reasonable royalty measure. The result is that courts have
distorted the reasonable royalty measure in various ways, adding ""kickers""
to increase damages, artificially raising the reasonable royalty rate, or
importing inapposite concepts like the ""entire market value rule"" in an
effort to compensate patent owners whose real remedy probably should have
been in the lost profits category.

In Part I, I explain the strict requirements for proving lost profits, and
give examples of patentees who have failed to meet these requirements. In
Part II, I explain how relegating these patentees to reasonable royalties
has led to problematic changes in reasonable royalty law. Finally, I
suggest in Part III that courts should draw a sharp division between the
injury suffered by patentees who compete with infringers and those who do
not. Patentees who compete should be entitled to the best estimate of lost
profits, even if not all elements of proof are available. Doing so will
avoid overcompensating patent owners in reasonable royalty cases.",TRUE,FALSE,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:32.043018,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:41:25.999000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/citation/,7mwn2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jrqg6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/relationships/node/,jrqg6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcd117b83f6901f3655e87/,57bcd117b83f6901f3655e87,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/requests/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7mwn2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7mwn2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7mwn2
