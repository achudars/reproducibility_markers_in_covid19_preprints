To examine what factors affect social media activity and how right-wing movements strategically adjust their content, I analyze the German right-wing movement Pegida, which uses Facebook for spreading its anti-Islam agenda and promoting events in the Internet. Data from Pegida’s Facebook page are combined with news reports over a period of 18 months to measure activity on Facebook and in the public sphere simultaneously. Results of quantitative text and time series analysis show that the quantity of posts by Pegida does not increase user activity, but it is the content of posts that matters. Moreover, findings highlight a strong connection between Facebook activities and the public sphere.

It demonstrates that, in the world of diplomacy, entities like 'Kosovo' can act only when they are carefully staged. Thus far, however, the academic discipline of International Relations (IR) has largely failed to acknowledge the role of diplomacy in the constitution of agency. Therefore, to clarify what is at stake in the theoretical debate, I begin with a systematic discussion of how IR has conceived of diplomatic representation. Taking cue from Bruno Latour's and Lisa Disch's writings on political representation, I then suggest an alternative understanding of diplomacy that takes its performative character seriously. Equipped with this conceptual toolkit, I subsequently turn to the story of Kosovo's representation at the Rambouillet conference held in 1999. Tracing how Kosovo Albanians and their international supporters staged Kosovo's diplomatic performance, and how the Yugoslav/Serbian delegation tried to undermine it, I demonstrate that diplomatic representation can indeed generate agency. I also identify three factors that influence whether or not a diplomatic performance succeeds in making those who are represented act: recognition by other international actors, practical competence, and the alignment of the represented.",TRUE,FALSE,agency|diplomacy|Kosovo|performativity|political representation|practice theory,2018-07-02T11:41:31.792272,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-03T15:30:53.129931,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d91|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Eastern European Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,Tobias Wille,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/citation/,fdhxj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x2u7b/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/relationships/node/,x2u7b,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a9a6ea3f63187000e0ceb2b/,5a9a6ea3f63187000e0ceb2b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdhxj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fdhxj/,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41268-017-0120-2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fdhxj

Not surprisingly, Muslims – a religiously and socio-culturally diverse faith-based populace – are not an exception. To address this complex area of criminal justice and social policy, some scholars advocate implementing restorative justice (RJ) approaches. While RJ approaches have been traditionally used in Islamic cultures for conflict resolutions, to date, few studies have investigated how RJ operates in dealing with IPV in Muslim countries and communities. This article explores how RJ approaches towards IPV operate in some Muslim countries/communities, and offers insights into developing culturally and religiously appropriate ways of implementing RJ in IPV situations among Muslims. Given the prevalence of IPV among Muslims, the question is particularly important and timely. Taking exclusively limited examples of RJ approaches that have been used to mediate IPV cases in Muslim countries and communities, this paper found one significant challenge in the RJ approaches among Muslims: inappropriate norms/understandings about IPV. To reduce IPV in Muslim society, it is necessary to develop treatment models and techniques that meet cultural and religious needs. This paper found that since RJ is not alien to Islamic teachings, RJ approaches can be implemented effectively in dealing with IPV among Muslims by ensuring justice and equity of the abused woman. The findings of this paper will assist policymakers, practitioners, and service providers in providing religiously and culturally appropriate care when addressing IPV issues among Muslims.",TRUE,FALSE,Intimate partner violence|Islam|Religion|Restorative justice|Social work,2018-07-02T11:41:31.665198,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-03T15:29:37.997275,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",Taylor &amp; Francis,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/citation/,jmbua,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u4pax/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/relationships/node/,u4pax,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a9a1cf1f6318700100cd22b/,5a9a1cf1f6318700100cd22b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jmbua/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jmbua/,https://doi.org/10.1080/15426432.2018.1440277,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jmbua

sensitive to critiques of the policy as regressive, costly or ineffective. The deduction is a popular
social policy that lowers the cost of owning a home for some homeowners by enabling them to deduct their mortgage interest payments from their federal tax liability. Although the deduction enjoys broad public support, critics argue that it disproportionately benefits wealthy households, fails to expand homeownership opportunities to households on the margins and costs the federal
government an extraordinary amount of money in foregone tax revenue. Drawing on data
collected through an on-line experiment, this analysis tests the sensitivity of public support to
these critiques. The findings reveal that support for the mortgage interest deduction declines
when respondents are presented with information about the cost, effectiveness or distribution of benefits associated with the deduction. Disaggregating support by political party and homeownership status reveals that support among renters is more sensitive to framing effects than that of homeowners. Republicans are less sensitive to framing effects than Democrats when the deduction is framed as distributing benefits unequally, but more sensitive to these effects when the issues is framed as costly. However, all groups register their lowest level of support when told that the mortgage interest deduction is not an effective tool for expanding ownership opportunities.",TRUE,FALSE,homeownership|housing|mortgage interest deduction|public opinion,2018-07-02T11:41:31.063568,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-02T12:59:55.789170,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Brian J.

The context of each migration stream influences the composition thereof and is reflected in the fertility behavior of immigrant women. Data from Statistics South Africa and the United States Census Bureau are used to analyze the odds of giving a birth in the past year for the top three most prominent immigrant groups in each country. Odds ratios from logistic regressions indicate that the fertility differences between nativity subgroups are partially due to the compositional effects of age, marital status, and educational attainment. However, interaction terms and predicted probabilities suggest similar fertility behavior between foreign- and native-born women across different levels of educational attainment in each destination country. The nativity subgroups where fertility differentials exist may be attributable to immigrant subcultures.",TRUE,FALSE,Immigrant fertility; comparative analysis; adaptation; life course,2018-07-02T11:41:30.926620,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-02T12:59:24.345632,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw63g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw63g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw63g/citation/,kw63g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw63g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ct3qr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw63g/relationships/node/,ct3qr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw63g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a98b9201af855000ffa3ce6/,5a98b9201af855000ffa3ce6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw63g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw63g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw63g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kw63g/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kw63g

Using recently digitized maps that precisely show neighborhoods marked with red ink (highest risk) or yellow ink (slightly lower risk), I document that surveyors disproportionately assigned the most restrictive credit rating to neighborhoods with black residents. Nearly 90 percent of African Americans in 1940 lived in a census tract marked for credit redlining. Comparing credit-restricted ""redlined"" census tracts to adjacent ""yellow-lined"" tracts, I estimate the long-run effects of redlining on housing and neighborhood outcomes. Between 1940 and 1970, redlining was associated with large differential declines in housing supply and population density; homeownership rates and racial composition did not change differentially from their 1940 baseline though. Once discriminatory lending was outlawed during the mid-1970s, there was moderate convergence in homeownership rates and racial composition. However, housing supply and population density remain persistently lower in formerly credit-restricted census tracts relative to their credit-favored neighbors. Although African-American neighborhoods were much more likely to be redlined, I show the effects do not vary by a neighborhood’s initial share of African American residents. Results also hold when restricting the sample to neighborhoods without any black residents in 1940. Taken together, these findings suggest redlining impacted neighborhood housing supply and population independent of pre-war patterns of racial segregation.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:41:30.621279,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-02T12:57:35.114533,NA,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/citation/,jdmq9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uxeaz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/relationships/node/,uxeaz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a9832da218b7b000f148e6f/,5a9832da218b7b000f148e6f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jdmq9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jdmq9/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jdmq9

Over the last decade, the platform developed into a leading marketing tool used for product promotion by social media influencers. Past research indicates that these influencers are regarded as opinion leaders and cooperate with brands to market products on YouTube through electronic-word-of-mouth mechanisms. However, surprisingly little is known about the magnitude of this phenomenon. In our article, we make a first attempt to quantify product promotion and use an original dataset of 139,475 videos created by German YouTube channels between 2009 and 2017. Applying methods for automated content analysis, we find that YouTube users indeed are confronted with an ever-growing share of product promotion, particularly in the beauty and fashion sector. Our findings fuel concerns regarding the social and economic impact of influencers, especially on younger target groups.",TRUE,FALSE,Influencer Marketing|Product Promotion|Social Media|Topic Modeling|YouTube,2018-07-02T11:41:30.559005,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-03-01T16:15:13.193863,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tskjb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tskjb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tskjb/citation/,tskjb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tskjb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jqu3n/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tskjb/relationships/node/,jqu3n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tskjb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a9822c01af855000df9380f/,5a9822c01af855000df9380f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tskjb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tskjb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tskjb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tskjb/,https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305118786720,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tskjb
