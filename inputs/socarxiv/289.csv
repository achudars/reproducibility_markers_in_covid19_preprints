We provide the first global overview of parental bereavement, its magnitude, prevalence, and distribution over age, for the 1950-2000 annual birth cohorts of women using a novel methodology from formal demography applied to data from the 2019 Revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects. We project that the global burden of parental bereavement will be 1.6 times lower for women born in the year 2000 than for women born in 1955. Accounting for compositional effects, we anticipate the largest improvements in regions of the Global South where offspring mortality continues to be a common life event. The paper quantifies an unprecedented shift in the timing of parental bereavement from reproductive to retirement ages. Starting with the 1985 cohort, women will be more likely to lose an adult child after age 65 than a young child before age 50, reversing a long-standing global trend. ""Child death"" will increasingly come to mean the death of adult offspring. We project persisting regional inequalities in offspring mortality and in the availability of children in later life, a particular concern for parents dependent on support from their children after retirement. Nevertheless, our analyses suggest a progressive narrowing of the historical gap between the Global North and South in the near future. These developments have profound implications for demographic theory, and highlight the need for policies to support bereaved older parents.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|family|mortality|population projections|social support,2019-11-16T21:55:03.801671,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-16T21:54:51.916916,NA,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/jdvhw/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s69fz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s69fz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s69fz/citation/,s69fz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s69fz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s69fz/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jdvhw/,jdvhw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s69fz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dce88bb9a4252001412acde/,5dce88bb9a4252001412acde,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s69fz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s69fz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s69fz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s69fz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s69fz,NA

The simultaneous and relatively rapid transitions that occur during gentrification make accounting for duration of exposure particularly important when exploring the relationship between gentrification and individual well-being. Though a large literature explores how the residential context, as well as the timing and duration of exposure to relatively stable neighborhood conditions, affects health, little is known about how duration of exposure to gentrification is linked to the health of longtime residents. Using restricted, longitudinal data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, I ask (1) how is duration of exposure to gentrification linked to individual health? (2) How is gentrification differentially linked to individual health outcomes across ethnoracial groups? Results demonstrate that a longer duration of residence in a gentrifying neighborhood is associated with improved self-reported health. This analysis suggests that efforts must be made to allow longtime residents to remain in their neighborhoods as they undergo change to ensure that these residents are able to reap the health benefits of the neighborhood improvements that accompany gentrification.",TRUE,FALSE,Gentrification|Health|Los Angeles|neighborhood effects,2019-11-15T08:09:01.351472,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-15T08:08:35.599005,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/citation/,5dmsk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dce28f05b97bd000c56d306/,5dce28f05b97bd000c56d306,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dmsk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5dmsk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5dmsk,NA

We estimate deep (measured as less than 20% of medians) and extreme (measured as less than 10% of medians) poverty in the U.S. from 1993-2016. Using the Current Population Survey, we match the income definition of the Luxembourg Income Study and adjust for underreporting using Urban Institute’s TRIM3 model. In 2016, we estimate 5.2 to 7.2 million Americans (1.6-2.2%) were deeply poor and 2.6 to 3.7 million (.8-1.2%) were extremely poor. While deep and extreme poverty fluctuated over time, including declines from 1993-1995 and 2007-2010, we find significant increases from lows in 1995 to peaks in 2016 in both deep (increases of 48-93%) and extreme poverty (increases of 54-111%). We even find significant increases with thresholds anchored at 1993 medians. Adding homelessness, deep poverty would be 7-8% higher and extreme poverty would be 19-23% higher in 2016, which suggests our estimates are probably lower-bounds. The rise of deep/extreme poverty is concentrated among childless households. Among households with children, the expansion of SNAP benefits has led to declines in deep/extreme poverty.

A longitudinal test of the asymmetry thesis of police-citizen contact","Objectives: Test the asymmetry thesis of police-citizen contact that police trustworthiness and legitimacy are affected more by negative than by positive experiences of interactions with legal agents by analyzing changes in attitudes towards the police after an encounter with the police. Test whether prior attitudes moderate the impact of contact on changes in attitudes towards the police.
Methods: A two-wave panel survey of a nationally representative sample of Australian adults measured people’s beliefs about police trustworthiness (procedural fairness and effectiveness), their duty to obey the police, their contact with the police between the two waves, and their evaluation of those encounters in terms of process and outcome. Analysis is carried out using autoregressive structural equation modeling and latent moderated structural models.
Results: The association between both process and outcome evaluation of police-citizen encounters and changes in attitudes towards the police is asymmetrical for trust in police effectiveness, symmetrical for trust in procedural fairness, and asymmetrical (in the opposite direction expected) for duty to obey the police. Little evidence of heterogeneity in the association between encounters and trust in procedural fairness and duty to obey, but prior levels of perceived effectiveness moderate the association between outcome evaluation and changes in trust in police effectiveness.
Conclusions: The association between police-citizen encounters and attitudes towards the police may not be as asymmetrical as previously thought, particularly for changes in trust in procedural fairness and legitimacy.

Although understanding the drivers of migration is critical to enacting effective policies, theoretical advances in the study of migration processes have been limited by the lack of data on flows of migrants, or by the fragmented nature of these flows. 
In this paper, we build on existing Bayesian modeling strategies to develop a statistical framework for integrating different types of data on migration flows. 
We offer estimates, as well as associated measures of uncertainty, for immigration, emigration, and net migration flows among 31 European countries, by combining administrative and household survey data from 2002 to 2015. Substantively, we document the historical impact of the EU enlargement and the free movement of workers in Europe on migration flows.

We set out a research agenda for answering the question of how platform power is held accountable that is both empirical and normative. Empirically, we emphasize the need to trace how accountability actually operates in practice. What accountability mechanisms exist, how are they used by publics, how do platforms respond, and with what effects? At the same time, we outline a normative agenda to investigate what genuine accountability requires and how existing accountability practices compare to this standard. Informed by deliberative approaches to democracy, and drawing in particular on Rainer Forst’s work on justification, we argue that the accountability of platforms is a question of their power being justified adequately to affected publics and that this depends on the quality of the discursive processes through which decisions about platforms are justified. Focusing on the quality of discursive processes allows us to distinguish critically between cases where publics merely accept platform power, unreflectively and in contexts of limited information and choice, to cases where power is justified through good reasons tested through inclusive public discourse.",TRUE,FALSE,Internet governance|Internet regulation|platform accountability|platform governance|platform regulation,2019-11-15T07:52:41.772841,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-15T07:52:25.597606,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/citation/,tx2db,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dccd4107cbfdf000c9d4f6c/,5dccd4107cbfdf000c9d4f6c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tx2db/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tx2db,NA

Frustration from the fact that there are too many meetings is a likely culprit because there at least 55 million meetings each day in the US with many millions more held around the world.  The prevalence and impact of meetings suggests that they are a grand challenge to human well being.  This editorial provides a contemporary set of simple rules to consider for the management of meetings and research in this specific domain.  A review was used to search for concepts associated with the study of meetings through formal syntheses of evidence in the primary research literature.  In total, ten rules for more meaningful meetings are identified along with a short discussion of their implications.  The salient themes that emerged were a paradigm of experimental and design thinking for meetings, attention to the human dimension of meetings, technology cannot be avoided so should be carefully used, and creativity is a viable outcome from many meetings.",TRUE,FALSE,heuristics|meetings|meeting science|rules|scientific synthesis,2019-11-15T07:51:40.876629,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-15T07:51:21.800377,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e15|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Organizational Communication,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ethrg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ethrg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ethrg/citation/,ethrg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ethrg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ethrg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ethrg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dcca55d871e81000ea6267b/,5dcca55d871e81000ea6267b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ethrg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ethrg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ethrg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ethrg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ethrg,NA

The concept of biological capital represents the accumulated history of biological experiences, alongside the other forms of accumulated capital, notably cultural, economic and social. The ability to access the three other forms of individual capital and therefore position in life depends on inherited biological health/skills, epigenetic imprinting and the accumulation of embodied biological changes that make an individual more or less successful in life. We present results from analyses carried out within the Lifepath consortium, showing that the socioeconomic environment, from early life and over the lifecourse, is an important risk factor for health and partly works through its effects on biological mechanisms. We show that socially stratified pre-disease states related to ageing may be examined using biomarkers, and help underline areas and mechanisms to promote healthy ageing.",TRUE,FALSE,allostatic load|biomarkers;|life-course epidemiology,2019-11-15T08:09:23.854106,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-15T08:09:10.633063,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swbde/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swbde/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swbde/citation/,swbde,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swbde/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swbde/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swbde/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dcc3da2a0651b001092789d/,5dcc3da2a0651b001092789d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swbde/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swbde/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/swbde/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/swbde/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/swbde,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-019-00539-w
