In order to answer this question, we use a unique locality-level panel from the 2010 and 2016 rounds of the Life in Transition Survey and data on the main land routes taken by migrants in 18 European countries during the refugee crisis in 2015. To capture the exogenous variation in natives’ exposure to transit migration, we construct an instrument that is based on the distance of each locality to the optimal routes that minimize travelling time between the main origin and destination cities. We first show that the entrepreneurial activity of natives falls considerably in localities that are more exposed to mass transit migration, compared to those located further away. We then explore the mechanisms and find that our results are likely to be explained by a decrease in the willingness to take risks as well as in the confidence in institutions. We also document an increase in the anti-migrant sentiment while attitudes towards other minorities remained unchanged. We rule out the possibility of out-migration of natives or of trade-related shocks (potentially confounded with the mass-transit migration) affecting our results. Using locality-level luminosity data, we also rule out any effect driven by changes in economic activity. Finally, we find no statistically significant effects on other labor market outcomes, such as unemployment or labor force participation.",TRUE,FALSE,entrepreneurship|mass migration|political instability|public attitudes|transit migration,2020-04-22T05:03:02.173352,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-21T20:44:37.556830,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2cd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2cd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2cd/citation/,pj2cd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2cd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2cd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2cd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9f2a8a35f4bf002f1f7504/,5e9f2a8a35f4bf002f1f7504,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2cd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2cd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pj2cd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pj2cd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pj2cd,NA

We argue that government leaders anticipate costly conflict and form larger ruling coalitions as uncertainty over threats increases. We develop a formal model of ethnic coalition formation that balances rational group leaders’ desire to maximize their own power and the anticipation of future costly conflict. The model locates the key source of violent conflict in uncertainty over the size of radical sub-groups that prefer conflict over cooperation. Where ruling elites manage to satisfy radical sub-group leaders by sharing power, the risk of rebellion decreases. Using the Ethnic Power Relations dataset, we find that multiethnic ruling coalitions with internally fragmented groups decrease the risk of armed conflict while having a negligible effect on coups.

To investigate this, the study relies on Irish cohort data (N = 6,303) collected around the Great Recession. A novel approach to mediation analysis is deployed, assessing predictions derived from models of family investment and family stress.
Parental job loss is found to exacerbate problem behaviour at age 3 and 5, via the channels of parental income and maternal negative parenting. By depressing parental income, job loss also hampers children's verbal ability at age 3. This is tied to reduced affordability of formal childcare, highlighting a policy lever that might tame the intergenerational toll of job loss.",TRUE,FALSE,child development|cognitive|intergenerational|Ireland|job loss|mediation analysis|problem behavior|recession|socio-emotional,2020-04-22T05:02:01.363060,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-21T16:40:54.019702,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2596e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2596e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2596e/citation/,2596e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2596e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2596e/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hp64a/,hp64a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2596e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9f200335f4bf00201f9360/,5e9f200335f4bf00201f9360,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2596e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2596e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2596e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2596e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2596e,NA

Is this because objective SES is not accounted for in a sufficiently exhaustive way?
	Methods: I pool eight waves of nationally representative survey data from Germany (German General Social Survey, 2004–18, N = 13,557) to assess the association between two separate subjective appraisals of SES (a ten-point scale and subjectively chosen social class membership) and poor self-rated health using logit and linear probability models.  I account for an exhaustive range of objective SES variables, including respondents’ household incomes and social status as well as occupational status, social class, education of respondents, and of their partners, fathers, and mothers.
	Results:  The association between subjective socioeconomic status and poor self-rated health remains stable even when accounting for a wide range of objective SES markers. This is true for both subjective SES measured on a ten-point scale and as a subjective class identification.
	Conclusions:  Even when controlling for a large number of objective SES markers, subjective SES and self-rated health are linked, suggesting that subjective assessments of SES are meaningful measures of SES which form a distinct pathway to health.",TRUE,FALSE,Family background|Germany|Self-rated health|Social status|Subjective SES|Subjective socioeconomic position|Subjective socioeconomic status,2020-04-22T05:02:13.108259,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-21T16:42:59.911659,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",The author,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2uwh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2uwh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2uwh/citation/,a2uwh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2uwh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2uwh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/53u7e/,53u7e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2uwh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9f0d699fd598001f567bb4/,5e9f0d699fd598001f567bb4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2uwh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2uwh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a2uwh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a2uwh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a2uwh,https://doi.org/10.1177/1403494820926053

Māori environmental philosophies and knowledge systems (mātauranga) are intricately rooted in and shaped by Pacific pathways, and shaped by the oral traditions that connect Pacific journeys, encounters with new landscapes, and the ongoing socio-environmental and political experiences of today. Ecological knowledge has a particularly important role within this mātauranga knowledge system, and as such is deeply embedded in tribal histories. The pairing of Māori environmental knowledge with a range of other scientific tools, models and analyses is a trend that will help provide beneficial indicators of population and ecosystem health, that will in turn feed the growth and continuance of mātauranga. Recent laws have pioneered co-management solutions that embody partnership with Māori tribal groups, and enable customary responsibilities. Ethical data management guidelines, that draw on a foundation of Māori philosophies, ethics and practices, are in development  for biobanking and genetic or genomic research. Museum and herbarium data are also increasingly being linked to cultural knowledge and relationships. For practitioners, access is a prerequisite to practice; locking up the environment, and locking up collections in museums, acts to alienate Māori and reduces capacity to respond to both cultural prerogatives and national challenges.

The geographic extent of this decline in North Amer- ica is unknown due to the lack of high-resolution palaeodemographic data from regions across and beyond the greater Southwest, where archaeological radiocarbon data is often the only avail- able proxy for investigating these palaeodemographic processes. Radiocarbon time series across and beyond the greater Southwest suggest widespread population collapses from AD 1300–1600. However, radiocarbon data have potential biases caused by variable radiocarbon sample preser- vation, sample collection, and the non-linearity of the radiocarbon calibration curve. In order to be confident in the wider trends seen in radiocarbon time series across and beyond the greater Southwest, here we focus on regions that have multiple palaeodemographic proxies and com- pare those proxies to radiocarbon time series. We develop a new method for time series anal- ysis and comparison between dendrochronological data and radiocarbon data. Results confirm a multiple proxy decline in human populations across the Upland US Southwest, Central Mesa Verde, and Northern Rio Grande from AD 1300–1600. These results lend confidence to single proxy radiocarbon-based reconstructions of paleodemography outside the Southwest that sug- gest post-AD 1300 population declines in many parts of North America.",TRUE,FALSE,dates-as-data|dendrochronology|palaeodemography|radiocarbon summed probability distributions|southwestern United States,2020-04-21T05:02:40.312880,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-21T01:31:41.823641,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbecz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbecz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbecz/citation/,hbecz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbecz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbecz/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s8ptc/,s8ptc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbecz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9dfa4aa0ea430018547210/,5e9dfa4aa0ea430018547210,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbecz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbecz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbecz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hbecz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hbecz,NA
