Religion, Politics, and Traditionalist Gender Ideology","Recent research shows that Americans who adhere to Christian nationalism―an ideology that idealizes and advocates a fusion of Christianity and American civic life―tend to hold authoritarian and exclusionary attitudes, particularly regarding ethno-racial minorities and non-traditional family forms. Such findings suggest a fundamental connection between Christian nationalism and rigid symbolic boundaries, which would likely extend to Americans’ understanding of gender roles. Drawing on notions connecting religious nationalism with defenses of patriarchal norms and utilizing a recent national, random sample of American adults, the current study examines the link between contemporary Christian nationalism and traditionalist gender ideologies. Our analyses reveal that Christian nationalism is the strongest predictor of holding a more traditionalist gender ideology, even after taking into account a host of political and religious characteristics. Moreover, the relationship between Christian nationalism and gender traditionalism holds across religious traditions, including more gender-egalitarian groups like Mainline Protestants and even the unaffiliated.

Religion is one of the key battlegrounds. The extent to which religious congregations include lesbians and gays in congregational life is vital to the wider debate over homosexuality because congregations consistently influence more Americans than any other voluntary social institution (Putnam 2000). Using nationally representative data from the 2006-2007 National Congregations Study this analysis investigates the level of acceptance of gays and lesbians within congregations as well as which congregations are most likely to allow lesbians and gays to become involved.

Method: This study employs simultaneous equation path models and a recent national, random sample of American adults (Baylor Religion Survey 2010) to test each hypothesis.
Results: Results reveal that constructed opinions about the origin and controllability of homosexuality significantly influence support for same-sex unions. However, these opinions are socially embedded, especially within particular political and religious ideologies.

In the present study, we examine relationships between small group participation at individual and congregation levels and civic engagement. Using multilevel modeling and national data on congregations and individuals from the U.S. Congregational Life Study (n = 82,044), we find that: (1) individual-level small group involvement is associated with four measures of civic engagement; (2) congregation-level small group participation is associated with both lower and higher civic engagement in the case of two outcomes; and (3) in the case of three civic outcomes, congregation-level small group participation moderates individual-level small group involvement such that small group members’ civic activity more closely resembles the lower civic engagement of small group nonparticipants. In the case of one civic outcome, at high levels of overall small group participation, small group members’ civic engagement drops below that of small group nonparticipants.

Drawing upon national survey data, we fit logistic regression models and compute standardized logistic regression coefficients to estimate the relative net effects of religious tradition, practices, and beliefs about the Bible on support for same-sex adoption. Findings reveal that religious factors are among the strongest predictors of opposition to same-sex adoption, but that religious tradition has no significant effect on support for same-sex adoption once frequency of religious practice and beliefs about the Bible are held constant. Americans who more frequently engage in practices such as religious service attendance and sacred text reading are less supportive of same-sex adoption, and compared to biblical literalists, those who believe the Bible requires interpretation, contains human error, or is a book of history/legends are all more likely to support same-sex adoption. Findings suggest that religious affiliations matter less for predicting same-sex adoption attitudes than how Americans practice and hold their faith.",TRUE,FALSE,Adoption|Homosexuality|Religion,2019-01-22T12:45:01.704126,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-22T11:57:40.094128,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm5f7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm5f7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm5f7/citation/,pm5f7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm5f7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm5f7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm5f7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c46250d2e57200017fe4568/,5c46250d2e57200017fe4568,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm5f7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm5f7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pm5f7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pm5f7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pm5f7,https://doi.org/10.1177/0192513X14536564

Prior work has not considered, however, whether such beliefs may influence the racial views of nonwhite Americans differently from white Americans. Drawing on a representative sample of black and white Americans from the 2014 General Social Survey, and focusing on explanations for racial inequality as the outcome, we show that, contrary to white Americans, black Americans who view being a Christian as essential to being an American are actually more likely to attribute black–white inequality to structural issues and less to blacks’ individual shortcomings. Our findings suggest that, for black Americans, connecting being American to being Christian does not necessarily bolster white supremacy, but may instead evoke and sustain ideals of racial justice.",TRUE,FALSE,Christian nationalism|Race|Racial ideology|Racism|Religion|United States,2019-01-22T12:48:07.439164,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-22T11:57:57.736714,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqpsv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqpsv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqpsv/citation/,dqpsv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqpsv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqpsv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqpsv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c461d8d154ce50019def1db/,5c461d8d154ce50019def1db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqpsv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqpsv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dqpsv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dqpsv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dqpsv,https://doi.org/10.1093/socrel/sry046
