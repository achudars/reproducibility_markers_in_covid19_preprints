As of 2010 census data the population of the county is 919,628, with an estimated population of 1,034,070 in 2015. The city of Charlotte, that covers the most area of Mecklenburg county, is the largest city in NC with close to 700,000 residents, and the seventeenth largest city in the US. Mecklenburg county is part of the NC-SC Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) of Charlotte, Concord, Gastonia.
546 square miles (1,410 km2) of Mecklenburg county is land and 22 square miles (57 km2) is water (US Census Bureau). Adjacent counties include: Iredell county, Cabarrus county, Union county, Gaston county, Catawba county, Lincoln county, Lancaster county (SC), and York county (SC).
Charlotte is home of a large banking industry and several Fortune 500 companies (Carmen et al., 2010). The banking industry makes Charlotte the second largest financial center in the US after New York and has one of the highest median wages in the region (Kozar, 2010). Another large industry in Charlotte is finance, insurance, and real estate, and the headquarters of several national corporations located in Charlotte (Bacot, 2008). Five Fortune 500 Companies that have their headquarters in Mecklenburg County are: Bank of America, Nucor, Sonic Automotive, Duke Energy, and Family Dollar (Dollar Tree) (Fortune, 2016). 
Education is another large economic sector in North Carolina due to having the largest public school system and a regional state university in this area (Bacot, 2008); these schools include: UNC Charlotte, Davidson College, Queens University, Johnson &amp; Wales University, Wake Forest University (School of Business) Charlotte Center, Johnson C. Smith University, Southern Evangelical Seminary, Central Piedmont Community College, and Belmont Abbey College. 
Other large employers in Mecklenburg county are Charlotte Mecklenburg Hospital, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, Wells Fargo Bank (A Corp), Bank of America, and US Air Inc (NC Department of Commerce, 2015, 4th quarter).
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport is the main airport in the region that is the 5th busiest airport in the nation in 2015, and the 6th busiest in the world (Portillo, 2016).  This airport is the hub for US Airways and American Airlines that have been merged in 2013, to become the second busiest hub for the combined carrier (Portillo, 2015). 
Charlotte, like other parts of the US, has been affected by the economic recession that started in 2007. Many job losses and unemployment expanded in all sectors of the economy. The banking industry that was the largest industry in the region was specifically affected by the recession, leaving the region with high unemployment (NC Department of Commerce, 2015, 4th quarter). However, one of the strongest assets of Charlotte economy is its diversity of employment, that even at the time of distress, would sustain its economy (Kozar, 2010).",TRUE,FALSE,Economic|Employment|Location Quotient|Mecklenburg County|NC|North Carolina|regional economic analysis,2018-07-20T14:06:42.264725,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-20T14:06:12.799722,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7wk2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7wk2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7wk2/citation/,y7wk2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7wk2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h9er2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7wk2/relationships/node/,h9er2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7wk2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b50c2873575e9001193844c/,5b50c2873575e9001193844c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7wk2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7wk2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7wk2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y7wk2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y7wk2,NA

This symposium was the culminating event of the research collaborative group Humanities for STEM: Using Archives to Bridge the Two Cultures Divide. The research collaborative was sponsored by a two-year grant (2016-2018) from the New York University Center for the Humanities. The group, which included teaching faculty, librarians, archivists, and graduate students from the New York/New Jersey area, sought to examine how the study of primary sources, archival research, and associated methodologies of the humanities can be used to enhance the understanding of science (including medicine), technology, engineering, and mathematics. For more information about the research collaborative, please see our Wordpress site: https://wp.nyu.edu/archives_collaborative/about-us/

In May 2017, the research collaborative issued a call for papers for the symposium. The CFP encouraged papers to focus on one of three topics: STEM general education, innovation in STEM, or ethics in STEM archives. For the full CFP, follow this link: https://wp.nyu.edu/archives_collaborative/call-for-papers-2018-symposium/. Submitted abstracts were reviewed by the research collaborative in September 2017 and those which adequately addressed the CFP were accepted. The accepted papers were peer-reviewed by the research collaborative members and feedback was given before the final papers were submitted. This review process was not blind. The Humanities for STEM Symposium was held on April 6-7, 2018 in Brooklyn, NY.

Research suggests that such ‘oppositional’ attitudes are prevalent among working class students and/or ethnoracial minorities. Like most of his classmates, however, Sam is white, hails from a privileged background, and attends a selective school in the Netherlands. Deeply ambivalent about working hard and ‘acting wise’, Sam and the others constituting his adolescent society are thoroughly caught up in peer dynamics which sanction success and promote mediocrity. We link these anti-school peer dynamics to the institutional configuration of education in the Netherlands, characterized by rigid tracking at the end of primary school and non-selective universities: state structures and policies contribute to these privileged students’ rationale for ‘taking it easy’ and doing poorly in school.",TRUE,FALSE,acting wise|education|elites|oppositional culture|peer pressure|stratification|The Netherlands|tracking,2018-07-18T19:28:02.467458,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-18T16:06:20.661874,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xc5zv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xc5zv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xc5zv/citation/,xc5zv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xc5zv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/2ub7a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xc5zv/relationships/node/,2ub7a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xc5zv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4f541433f0b9000eba9350/,5b4f541433f0b9000eba9350,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xc5zv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xc5zv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xc5zv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xc5zv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xc5zv,https://doi.org/10.1080/14675986.2016.1144383

Federalism, one of the demands of such transformations, has become a contentious issue for Dalits. Dalit leaders had initially mostly been centered on ensuring proportional representation in central and local governments, along with special rights as a compensation for their historical oppression (Bhattachan 2008). However, after the Peoples’ Movement of 2006, with Janajatis and Madhesis demanding provinces along ethnic and regional lines, Dalit leaders and scholars began to discuss the relevance of federalism for Dalits as well as possibility of their own Dalit province. This issue climaxed with State Restructuring High Commission Report suggesting provision of a non-territorial province for Dalits.
But is a Dalit province, or federalism, needed for Dalits? Is the issue of federalism and Dalit province an aspiration, or a concern, of common Dalits? Or is it just an interest of Dalit leaders and elites? This paper tries to analyse public opinion of Dalits, based on a survey of public opinion in two VDCs of Nepal, on the various issues related to federalism, including aspirations of Dalits in the proposed constitution and perceptions of Dalits on successive political movements and government provisions for Dalits since 1990.",TRUE,FALSE,Dalit|Dalit province|Federalism,2018-07-18T19:27:21.654588,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-18T16:04:41.718158,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/citation/,fn9t5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7b86y/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/relationships/node/,7b86y,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4f0c206d4eb300106ee1a1/,5b4f0c206d4eb300106ee1a1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fn9t5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fn9t5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fn9t5,NA

The purpose of the present study was to examine relationship between the types of posts different people on share on a Facebook page called: “Secret Jaffa” and the amount of attention (measured in “Likes” and “Comments”) given by different members of the group. Data was collected from the latest 50 posts shared in “Secret Jaffa” from members in that group. This study may assist others in understanding what types of posts motivate people to click “Like” or “Comment”, by gaining much of the popularity online. To accomplish this, some of the applicable measures of social networks are centrality, transitivity, clustering, and diameter. The latest posts of 50 participants, 25 men and 25 women, were observed, and tested, for popularity. Results indicate that on average the advertising posts shared in that certain group receive the largest number of social engagements (i.e., likes and comments).",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-20T14:08:30.768143,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-20T14:08:00.156263,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/citation/,xwvgm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/597fv/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/relationships/node/,597fv,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4ed38633f0b9000dba4472/,5b4ed38633f0b9000dba4472,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xwvgm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xwvgm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xwvgm,NA

Even in the sophisticated variants of contextualization typical of the New Historicism, she explains, scholars' obsession with historical context as the ultimate source of textual meaning disregards the capacity of literature to resonate across time and space. ""Why is it,"" she writes, ""that we can feel solicited, button-holed, stirred up, by words that were drafted eons ago?"" (576). Felski is not the first to raise such objections. In an essay from 2001, Russell Berman takes a similar approach to the politics of periodization, pointing out how periodizing a work can serve to discipline it, that is to say, to deny its claim on the reader's present. For Berman, ""A literary-critical culture that values historical frames over 'artistic pleasure,' . . . tends to dismiss the diachronic moment in any reading, and with it the potential of tradition, the capacity precisely to transcend the constraints of the isolated historical moment."" Both Felski and Berman present powerful arguments against the fetishization of contemporaneity as the source of the truth of a work. In their focus on affect, however, they neglect a crucial facet of the transtemporal resonance they seek to underscore.  To limit oneself to the question of how and why literature can ""solicit,"" ""button-hole,"" and ""stir us up"" is to understate its role as both an instrument of cognition and a means of fostering particular cognitive capacities, or at least to sidestep the constitutive role of cognition in the experience of aesthetic pleasure.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-20T14:05:02.070134,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-20T14:04:41.733621,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/citation/,78zpu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4zhgr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/relationships/node/,4zhgr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4e765833f0b9000cba1c05/,5b4e765833f0b9000cba1c05,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/78zpu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/78zpu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/78zpu,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.014

We offer a methodology to identify and evaluate correlations between semantic and geographic distance in a printed corpus. Our work combines geographic information science (GIS) with corpus linguistics to study how places are described, how spatial categories coalesce and change, and how patterns in language correlate with patterns in geography. At its base, we'll argue, geospatial text analysis blends two key theoretical concepts. In GIS, the principle of ""spatial autocorrelation"" holds that nearby places tend to have similar characteristics at similar times. In computational semantics, the ""distributional hypothesis"" suggests that words with similar meanings tend to appear near each other in documents. Taken together, these hypotheses form a single idea: similar places at similar times tend to be described using similar words. To put this idea into action, we propose a data structure — the word-place matrix  —  that indexes a corpus to geographical features. Over a word-place matrix, measurements of word association are simultaneously measurements of spatial overlap. In just the same way that terms in a corpus can be gathered into conceptual groups, words in a word-place matrix can be associated with corresponding geographical regions. This very simple data format offers an easy-to-implement and theoretically well-grounded method for studying cultural topics with strong spatial components.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-20T14:05:28.101230,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-07-20T14:05:14.138708,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/citation/,85nfc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vhqrx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/relationships/node/,vhqrx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b4e71256d4eb300106e665b/,5b4e71256d4eb300106e665b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/85nfc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/85nfc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/85nfc,https://doi.org/10.22148/16.017
