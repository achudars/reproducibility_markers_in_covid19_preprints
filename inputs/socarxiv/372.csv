Spurred on by global economic change, robotization, and the decline of labor unions, state labor markets have shifted away from an occupational regime dominated by the production of goods to one characterized by the provision of services. Prior studies have proposed that deterioration of employment opportunities may be associated with the rise of substance use disorders and drug overdose deaths, yet no clear link between changes in labor market dynamics in the U.S. manufacturing sector and drug overdose deaths has been established. Using restricted-use vital registration records between 1999-2017 that comprise over 700,000 drug deaths, I test two questions. First, what is the association between manufacturing decline and drug and opioid overdose mortality rates? Second, how much of the increase in these drug-related outcomes can be accounted for by manufacturing decline? The findings provide strong evidence that restructuring of the U.S. labor market has played an important upstream role in the current drug crisis. Up to 77,000 overdose deaths for men and up to 40,000 overdose deaths for women are attributable to the decline of state-level manufacturing over this nearly two-decade period. These results persist in models that adjust for other social, economic, and policy trends changing at the same time, including the supply of prescription opioids. Critically, the findings signal the value of policy interventions that aim to reduce persistent economic precarity experienced by individuals and communities, especially the economic strain placed upon the middle class.",TRUE,FALSE,Drug Overdose Deaths|Economic Conditions|Manufacturing Decline|Mortality|Social Determinants,2019-10-16T18:35:40.855844,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-16T16:07:42.289077,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course",Nathan Seltzer,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/citation/,cdwap,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da6ae13a7bc73000bee507c/,5da6ae13a7bc73000bee507c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cdwap/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cdwap/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cdwap,NA

Natural resource development generally takes two forms, extractive (e.g. oil and gas, mining, timber) and non-extractive (e.g. tourism, recreation, real estate). However, research has rarely examined both in-tandem. Drawing on the concept of dependence (i.e. over-specialization), I test the hypothesis that increasing levels of both forms of development was associated with diminishing returns to economic prosperity— operationalized as per capita income, inequality, and poverty—in rural America over the period of 2000 to 2015. Extractive development exhibited the expected relationship in remote rural counties for all outcomes, while non-extractive development had a generally negative relationship with per capita income, a positive relationship with poverty, and no relationship with inequality. Support for the overall hypothesis was limited due to the returns of non-extractive development being more negative than expected.",TRUE,FALSE,Dependency|Natural resource dependence|Outdoor recreation|Poverty|Resource curse|Rural tourism|Tourism|Uneven Development|United States,2019-10-16T18:31:24.374230,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-16T16:07:00.010249,FALSE,NA,no,Please see linked project for data information,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pcwm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pcwm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pcwm/citation/,5pcwm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pcwm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pcwm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xfyug/,xfyug,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pcwm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da5f080a7bc73000eee76b7/,5da5f080a7bc73000eee76b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pcwm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pcwm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5pcwm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5pcwm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5pcwm,https://doi.org/10.1177/0891242420984512

There have been many attempts to propose a standard for textual resource interoperability, from the ubiquitous Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) format to more recent proposals like the Distributed Text Services (DTS) protocol. In this paper, we critically survey these attempts and introduce our proposal called SHINE, which aims to escape from TEI’s legacy and prioritize instead the ease for software developers to representation and exchange textual resources and their associated metadata. We do so by combining a hierarchical model of textual structure with a flexible metadata scheme in SHINE, and we continue to define and develop it based on user-centered and iterative design principles. Therefore, we argue that SHINE is a protocol for textual interoperability that successfully balances flexibility of resource representation, consistency across resource representation, and overall simplicity of implementation.",TRUE,FALSE,digital humanities|digital resources|digital texts|interoperability|metadata|TEI|textual resources,2019-10-16T18:28:42.234809,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-16T16:06:08.289484,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Cataloging and Metadata,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/citation/,qrmg8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bx8pw/,bx8pw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da5a583a7bc73000bed7a68/,5da5a583a7bc73000bed7a68,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qrmg8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qrmg8,NA

The Case of Convertible Bonds,"This paper argues that the reduced-form jump diffusion model may not be appropriate for credit risk modeling. To correctly value hybrid defaultable financial instruments, e.g., convertible bonds, we present a new framework that relies on the probability distribution of a default jump rather than the default jump itself, as the default jump is usually inaccessible. As such, the model can back out the market prices of convertible bonds. A prevailing belief in the market is that convertible arbitrage is mainly due to convertible underpricing. Empirically, however, we do not find evidence supporting the underpricing hypothesis. Instead, we find that convertibles have relatively large positive gammas. As a typical convertible arbitrage strategy employs delta-neutral hedging, a large positive gamma can make the portfolio highly profitable, especially for a large movement in the underlying stock price.",TRUE,FALSE,asset pricing|convertible arbitrage|convertible bond|convertible underpricing|credit risk modeling|default probability approach|default time approach|jump diffusion,2019-10-14T22:11:42.196388,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-14T22:11:33.239369,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/citation/,zr7hp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da499f7f6b03e001020852f/,5da499f7f6b03e001020852f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zr7hp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zr7hp,NA

Informed by both life course and biographical perspectives, our research design comprised two interviews incorporating recursive co-construction of the participant’s lifeline. We aimed to meet three objectives with this method: (1) to collect accurate retrospective data about the timing of lives; (2) to garner biographical data that allowed us to explore lives as wholes; and (3) to elicit participant reflexivity on turning points associated with resilience.  Our approach was distinctive in its explicit use of the lifeline both as a means to bring life stories into dialogue with life histories, and as a dynamic prompt to engage participants in the reflexive co-construction of turning points as fateful moments. We illustrate our approach through a case presentation and analysis of the reflexive lifelines co-constructed with two men who participated in our study.

We concentrate on three main areas: content policy, the process which develops the rules for what speech and activity is permissible on Facebook, and then enforces those rules across the platform; News Feed, the assemblage of algorithms that directly mediates the information to which Facebook users are exposed; and governance, which goes beyond transparency to the internal governance of Facebook, and the mounting concern that Facebook is not adequately accountable to its users and other stakeholders in the countries and communities in which it operates.",TRUE,FALSE,content moderation|democracy|facebook|free expression,2019-10-15T08:30:25.688611,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-15T08:21:44.979827,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7y82/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7y82/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7y82/citation/,t7y82,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7y82/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7y82/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uxfmb/,uxfmb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7y82/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da443abf6b03e000d1fc012/,5da443abf6b03e000d1fc012,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7y82/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7y82/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t7y82/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t7y82/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t7y82,NA

While the literature relates legislature size to representation and government expenditure, its implications for welfare remain understudied. In this paper, we investigate the effects of legislature size on welfare, exploiting exogenous changes in city-council size in Brazil between 2005 and 2008. We show that adding a legislator improves education and health care. However, the results prove true for the services that are believed to be highly salient to voters, are easiest to claim credit for, and are easy to provide. In this sense, education quality and preventive health care remain unaffected while infant mortality and primary school enrollment significantly improve. To investigate the mechanism, we surveyed former councilors and analyzed 346,553 bills proposed by municipalities in the period. This analysis largely corroborates our findings, showing that politicians prefer to provide private and local public goods. This paper has implications for the design of legislative institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,Brazil|Education and Heath Care|Legislature Size|Regression Discontinuity Design|Welfare,2019-10-14T22:19:24.280161,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-14T22:18:56.229301,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r97e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r97e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r97e/citation/,8r97e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r97e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r97e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r97e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da40d71a7bc73000eecdc3d/,5da40d71a7bc73000eecdc3d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r97e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r97e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8r97e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8r97e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8r97e,NA
