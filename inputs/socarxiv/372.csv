We conjecture that the answer depends on whether credible information about individuals’ toughness is available. When people send credible signs and signals of their toughness disputes may be solved without violence. We use a laboratory experiment in which subjects create information about their toughness and decide whether to take others’ resources and resist in case others’ attempt to take theirs. Subjects perform a potentially painful but safe physical exercise to create information and to determine who wins and loses fights. This, realistically, ranks subjects according to their toughness and implicates toughness, a quality important in real conflict, in fighting. We find that, consistent with theory, information reduces fighting. This suggests that, in addition to the theories traditionally used to explain prisoner behavior, the availability of credible information about toughness influences prison conflict.",TRUE,FALSE,Fighting|Laboratory Experiment|Prison|Signaling Theory,2019-05-14T13:47:01.663018,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-14T13:46:18.490015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",Aron Szekely and Diego Gambetta,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5eb4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5eb4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5eb4/citation/,x5eb4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5eb4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5eb4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5eb4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cda741bdb3c0a0018d00d21/,5cda741bdb3c0a0018d00d21,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5eb4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5eb4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x5eb4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x5eb4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x5eb4,NA

dynamics of the modern social order. The implications of modern society on the nature of being human in a social world are vast, as demonstrated by the myriad upheavals witnessed since the ‘long’ 19th century2. But what are the implications of modern society on what it means to be a moral  being? How do individualism and social solidarity coexist? The following addresses the complexity of these questions by analyzing Weber and Durkheim’s perspectives on the transition to modern life and the relationship between modern society and the individual. With Marx as a theoretical backdrop, this essay examines how Weber and Durkheim conceived of the problems of modern society by underscoring the dualities that are reflected in autonomy, authority, rationalization, and other dimensions of structure inherent within social organization and interdependence. These concomitant dualities evince the necessary doubleness of the human condition and how it enmeshes society in a “poverty of morality” (Durkheim,  Suicide , p. 387) that is in need of a new moral order and greater social solidarity.",TRUE,FALSE,classical social theory|duality of structure|durkheim|political sociology|weber,2019-05-14T13:01:21.239644,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-14T13:00:40.946922,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Jules Ostro,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/citation/,3uvkr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bc8w9/,bc8w9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd9da1f2d1b9e001ca25cc8/,5cd9da1f2d1b9e001ca25cc8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3uvkr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3uvkr,NA

I test hypotheses regarding the overall disparities between ethnoracial groups, potential limited returns on socioeconomic status and acculturation characteristics for black, Hispanic, and Asian households relative to white households, and the positive effects of high coethnic populations within the county of residence. Results show there are significant gaps between whites and the other groups regarding their attainment of affordable housing throughout the study period. Differential returns on socioeconomic status are also present, with Hispanics and Asians receiving lesser returns on education relative to whites. Hispanics received significant benefits regarding immigrant status compared to other ethnoracial groups. When accounting for county-level ethnoracial composition there is clear evidence that black, Hispanic, and Asian households are more likely to benefit than white households if they live in a county with an increased coethnic population. However, all groups become less likely overall to live in affordable housing as a county’s percentage white decreases suggesting that ethnoracial composition affects both the overall attainment of affordable housing for all groups and the relative disparities between groups within counties.",TRUE,FALSE,Affordable Housing|Ethnicity|Race|Residential Attinment|United States,2019-05-14T12:59:28.633639,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-14T12:59:00.385881,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,Matthew M.

While sociological theories would predict  inequality to increase following the passage of Right to Work laws, previous research has found these laws to be largely inconsequential for economic inequality. Drawing on power resources theory, I reassess the consequences of Right to Work laws and allow their impact to depend upon local union membership. To do so, I construct unique datasets at the state and commuting zone levels of income and wage inequality, merging data from the Internal Revenue Service, the US census, the American Community Survey, the US Union Sourcebook, the Current Population Survey, and the National Labor Relations Board for years 1939 to 2016. After using two-way fixed effects and instrumental variable regression models to replicate inconsistent results of previous studies, I show that these mask substantial and robust heterogeneity across local areas. Simply put, Right to Work laws are highly consequential when passed in times and places where labor has something to lose. Right to Work laws remove the negative association between labor union membership and inequality, while the consequences of Right to Work passage are greatest in highly unionized areas. In total, results suggest that Right to Work laws work as intended, increasing economic inequality indirectly  by lowering labor power resources.

The potential they have for causing serious injury gives them a contradictory power: They can be used to do serious violence or to reduce the likelihood of any violence; they can deescalate an altercation or prime aggressive behavior; and they can be essential mechanisms for self- protection while also being offensive and dangerous. These contradictions make weapon carrying and use fascinating but complicated areas to study, and this complexity can be seen both in public and in academic debate. Throughout this chapter, when considering offender decision making, it is important to recall the many overlapping and often contradictory functions that weapons fulfill for users. Binary interpretations of weapons as having purely offensive or defensive functions will limit our ability to understand offender decision making and should be avoided wherever possible.

Further, it is argued that engineering educators are not well aware of ‘feedback comments’ that are associated with assessment practices. Comments on students’ performances are essential because it helps them to know their strengths and weaknesses of a course. In this background, the paper critically analyses assessment and evaluation practices in engineering education setup across the globe.

This article describes the design and development of identification of students' misconceptions in an individualized learning environment (iSMILE) system that includes accommodations for students’ misconceptions in order to improve student’s conceptual understanding and finally learning outcome. The assessment process is carried out by preparing two-level multiple-choice questions. Misconceptions are identified for each instructional objective to make a root question and linked questions. Depending on the answers provided by the student in first level, the linked questions are given to get more information regarding the misconception.

Answering this question is important because knowing which factors are associated with mental health-related calls could influence effective resource allocation. I analyze census tract- level data across three cities and find that a lack of financial resources is positively associated with mental health-related calls, independent of poor mental health. I argue that individuals of low socioeconomic status rely on this public safety net more so than affluent individuals, and that this is an under-recognized mechanism by which individuals of low socioeconomic status with mental illness come into contact with police.",TRUE,FALSE,mental illness|police|socioeconomic status,2019-05-13T00:19:22.124283,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-13T00:19:01.932071,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxqhp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxqhp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxqhp/citation/,dxqhp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxqhp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxqhp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxqhp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd8b228f8214b00178d0823/,5cd8b228f8214b00178d0823,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxqhp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxqhp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxqhp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dxqhp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dxqhp,NA

Our quotidian has been transformed over the last fifty years by the adoption of innovative networking and computing technology. The digital world presents opportunities for public archaeology to engage, inform and interact with people globally. Yet, as more personal data are published online, there are growing concerns over privacy, security, and the long-term implications of sharing digital information. These concerns extend beyond the living, to the dead, and are thus important considerations for archaeologists who share the stories of past people online. This analysis argues that the ‘born-digital’ records of humanity may be considered as public digital mortuary landscapes, representing death, memorialization and commemoration. The potential for the analysis of digital data from these spaces could result in a phenomenon approaching immortality, whereby artificial intelligence is applied to the data of the dead. This paper investigates the ethics of a digital public archaeology of the dead while considering the future of our digital lives as mnemonic spaces, and their implications for the living.
