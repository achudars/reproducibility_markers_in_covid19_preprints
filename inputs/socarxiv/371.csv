Despite significant, longstanding attention in geographical problems, recent advances in non-linear techniques for dimension reduction, called manifold learning, have not been adopted in classic data-intensive geographical problems. More generally, machine learning methods for geographical problems often focus more on applying standard machine learning algorithms to geographic data, rather than applying true ""spatially-correlated learning,"" in the words of Kohonen. As such, we suggest a general way to incentivize geographical learning in machine learning algorithms, and link it to many past methods that introduced geography into statistical techniques. We develop a specific instance of this by specifying two geographical variants of Isomap, a non-linear dimension reduction, or ""manifold learning,"" technique. We also provide a method for assessing what is added by incorporating geography and estimate the manifold's intrinsic geographic scale. To illustrate the concepts and provide interpretable results, we conducting a dimension reduction on geographical and high-dimensional structure of social and economic data on Brooklyn, New York. Overall, this paper's main endeavor--defining and explaining a way to ""geographize"" many machine learning methods--yields interesting and novel results for manifold learning the estimation of intrinsic geographical scale in unsupervised learning.",TRUE,FALSE,dimension reduction|geographical analysis|geographic data science|geography|isomap|machine learning|manifold learning|spatial science,2019-05-16T02:58:06.862107,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-16T02:57:52.904028,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/citation/,75s8v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8m2bk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/relationships/node/,8m2bk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdc4028ea57270019139633/,5cdc4028ea57270019139633,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/75s8v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/75s8v

At the heart of the commercial success of recommendation algorithms is their ability to make an accurate prediction of a target person’s preferences for previously unseen items. Can these algorithms also be used to predict which health messages an individual will evaluate favorably, and thereby provide effective tailored communication to the person? Although there is evidence that message tailoring enhances persuasion, little research has examined the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms for tailored health interventions aimed at promoting behavior change. We developed a message tailoring algorithm to select smoking-related public service announcements (PSAs) for smokers, and experimentally test its effectiveness in predicting a target smoker’s evaluations of PSAs and encouraging smoking cessation. The tailoring algorithm was constructed using multiple levels of data on smokers’ PSA rating history, individual differences, content features of the PSAs, and other smokers’ PSA ratings. We conducted a longitudinal online experiment to examine its efficacy in comparison to two non-tailored methods: “best in show” (choosing messages most preferred by other smokers) and “off the shelf” (random selection from eligible ads). The results showed that the tailoring algorithm produced more accurate predictions of smokers’ message evaluations than the simple-average method used for the “best in show” approach. Smokers who viewed PSAs recommended by the tailoring algorithm were more likely than those receiving a random set to evaluate the PSAs favorably and quit smoking. There was no significant difference between the “best in show” and “off the shelf” methods in message assessment and quitting behavior.",TRUE,FALSE,health communication|message tailoring|Recommendation algorithms,2019-05-16T02:57:27.503724,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-16T02:57:06.254579,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication,JOSEPH Cappella,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/citation/,nu6tg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdc18aadb3c0a0019d1054b/,5cdc18aadb3c0a0019d1054b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nu6tg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nu6tg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nu6tg

To fill this gap, computational observation offers a novel approach—the unobtrusive and automated collection of information encountered within algorithmically curated media environments by means of a browser plug-in. In contrast to prior methodological approaches, browser plug-ins allow for reliable capture and repetitive analysis of both content and context at the point of the actual user encounter. After discussing the technological, ethical, and practical considerations relevant to this automated solution, we present our open-source browser plug-in as an element in an adequate multi-method design, along with potential links to panel surveys and content analysis. Ultimately, we present a proof-of-concept study in the realm of news exposure on Facebook; we successfully deployed the plug-in to Chrome and Firefox, and we combined the computational observation with a two-wave panel survey.

Family Background and Academic Performance in Germany, Norway, and the United States","Research on educational mobility usually fails to consider variation in the association between social origin and academic performance across the distribution of children’s academic performance. However, theories of social mobility as well as theories about resource allocation within families predict such variation. We use quantile regression models to estimate variations in the associations between different indicators of family background (parental education, occupation, earnings, and wealth) and children’s educational performance across the performance distribution. We apply this approach to data on Germany, Norway, and the United States, three countries that represent different kinds of welfare and education regimes that may affect the intergenerational transmission of educational advantage. We find a stronger association between family background and academic performance at the bottom than in the middle and the weakest association at the top of the performance distribution.

ground for comparison with the work of feminist existential philosopher Simone de Beauvoir’s  The Second Sex,  which was published just a couple of years earlier in 1949. The following exposition of Adorno’s essay and the “Introductory"" and “Independent Woman” chapters in Beauvoir’s  The Second Sex examines how Adorno’s application of Freudian psychoanalytic theory of mass psychology and the modern authoritarian state aligns with Beauvoir’s theoretical dialectic of the man as transcendent Subject versus the woman as immanent Other. The connective thread in both contexts is a hegemonic teleology of dominance. This hegemony is the apparatus and function of both predominately male fascist dictators and sexist social actors who pander to collective entities of followers captivated by the ostensible auspices of the Father-Leader. The following use of the term Father-Leader will be used as a symbolic gesture and catch-all term to simplify the analogy between Adorno’s fascist dictator and the historically paternalistic man. The symbolic authority of the Father-Leader lies in his ability to generate an affect-driven, hypnotic libidinal bond through the mechanisms of identification and idealization with a mass ancillary entity, in this case either a fascist following of a nation or a large majority of the population, thus maintaining social and political privilege, influence, and control.",TRUE,FALSE,adorno|beauvoir|feminist existentialism|feminist philosophy|freudian analysis|group psychology,2019-05-15T11:07:21.194258,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-15T11:06:43.765238,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e52|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Body and Embodiment,Jules Ostro,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/citation/,znmcq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/64fmg/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/relationships/node/,64fmg,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdb555b2d1b9e0019a413ad/,5cdb555b2d1b9e0019a413ad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/znmcq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/znmcq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/znmcq

That is, we examine whether parental death has an equalizing or exacerbating effect on offspring socioeconomic attainment, and also whether the socioeconomic status of the rest of the family plays a meaningful role in compensating for parental death. Using data on cohorts born 1973 to 1982 we examine five different outcomes, which are grade point average (GPA) at age 16 in high school, the transition from lower to upper-secondary education, the transition to tertiary education, overall educational attainment, and occupational status by age 30. We match families based upon antemortem parental socioeconomic trajectories. Overall, we find mixed results in our between-family regression analyses adjusting for observables, with inconsistent evidence suggesting that losing a parent with very high socioeconomic resources is worse, and some evidence for a protective effect if the socioeconomic resources of the surviving parent and extended family members are at the top of the distribution. Using sibling fixed effects models that adjust for unobservable factors shared within the family, we see zero results for moderation by parents’ occupations, but find consistent evidence that it is worse to lose a father at a younger age if grandparents have higher ranked occupations. We discuss possible interpretations of our findings.",TRUE,FALSE,human capital|occupational attainment|parental death|parental exposure|social mobility,2019-05-14T13:25:02.187690,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-14T13:24:03.900901,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udv9y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udv9y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udv9y/citation/,udv9y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udv9y/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udv9y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udv9y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdaa9f22d1b9e001ba2bf27/,5cdaa9f22d1b9e001ba2bf27,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udv9y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udv9y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/udv9y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/udv9y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/udv9y
