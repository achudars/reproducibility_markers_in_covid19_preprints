By focusing on a major childcare reform in East and West Germany, we examine the effect in two contexts that differ markedly in the acceptance and use of formal childcare and maternal employment. We combine rich longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (2006 to 2014) with annual administrative county-level data on the availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare, estimating event history models. The results indicate that increased childcare availability for under-three-year-olds reduces mothers’ employment interruptions, particularly after a second childbirth, and increases the probability of returning to part-time or full-time employment as opposed to marginal employment. Furthermore, increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare increases mothers’ likelihood of returning to employment in the second year after childbirth, when paid leave entitlements expire and the availability of childcare becomes important. However, our results are only statistically significant for West German mothers and only after the birth of a second child. The study extends the literature on women’s return-to-work behaviour by providing evidence on the medium-term impact of family policy on the duration of mothers’ employment interruptions.",TRUE,FALSE,childcare|duration of employment interruption|early childhood education|family policy|maternal employment|social policy,2019-10-17T17:40:22.306380,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-17T17:40:00.759969,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/citation/,jb28c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da860b0f1b0a9000c6251d5/,5da860b0f1b0a9000c6251d5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jb28c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jb28c,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcx068

David and I did not know each other well, but shared a belief that our open source community (OSC, hereafter) was an unsafe place for anyone who did not identify as white, cisgendered, heterosexual and male. That lack of safety was further complicated by any one individual’s distance from privileged modes of contribution. In OSC, developers who were on key Contribution Teams and regularly added code to the codebase were valued more highly than those who contributed documentation, user experience research, or quality assurance work. David asked ”What if we made a survey that accounted for all of the ways that people make the web? Can we do it intersectionally? Can we do it the OSC way?” Over the following 18 months, David and I worked with a team of OSC community members on the creation, dissemination and analysis of a quantitative demographic survey of OSC. This survey was the first step in a project to create safer spaces within OSC for individuals from marginalized groups.

Prior computational analyses attempting to analyze these elements have primarily relied on summarizing relatively low-level-features. Beginning with the early work of Barry Salt, one particularly prominent metric is the distribution of median shot lengths. Works on shot length include Yuri Tsivian’s Cinemetrics project, Arclight, and Jeremy Butler’s ShotLogger. Other computational analyses examine the aggregation of language and average shot color, image compositions, and analysis of  film scripts. These projects have demonstrated the feasibility of distributing extracted metadata from copyrighted materials and the power of computational techniques in accessing useful information over a large collection of moving images.

Grounded on the interpretive paradigm, forty two (42) participants were recruited to partake in this study. Further, reflection papers from the participants serve as the narratives of the study and where then reflectively analyze via the process of thematization. 

After the three (3) level of reflective analysis, the following themes were identified: (1) Dedication: Focused Learning; (2) Mastery of Professional Qualities; (3) Setbacks: Stress &amp; Weariness. The themes shows that in general, the overall experience of the participants was affirmative and optimistic claiming that LRSS promotes a conducive learning environment wherein they felt “less pressured” to perform task. Further the participants felt that the LRSS provides them with a mean to fully realize the development of their professional qualities, skills and attitude of a “real” nurse since it mirrors the realities of an “on-the-job-training”. Lastly, the identified setbacks of the LRSS are two-folds: stress and a sense of weariness, largely attribute to the consecutive days of duty schedules as well as a perceived monotony of activities in the area of exposure. 

Insights from this study suggest that there is a need to update and upgrade strategies and methodologies of teaching implemented in the clinical area to provide varied approaches to learning skills as well as limit the perception of monotony among student clinicians. Further research that dwells on the (1) nature of stress, (2) the patterns of coping and adjustment among student clinicians is also implied",TRUE,FALSE,Clinical Rotation|nursing|nursing education|qualitative research|Related Learning Experience,2019-10-16T18:38:01.705481,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-16T16:08:14.584078,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d60|Education|Health and Physical Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/citation/,nb8pa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da6d375fcf91f001224c1fd/,5da6d375fcf91f001224c1fd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nb8pa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nb8pa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nb8pa,NA
