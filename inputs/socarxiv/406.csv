A forerunner filmmaker between Portugal and Brazil,"Bárbara Virgínia was a forerunner film director in Portugal and the Festival de Cannes.
Starting artistically as a diseuse and actress, she directed a feature film and a documentary in her youth, in 1946. Bárbara emigrated to Brazil in 1952 to work on radio and television, the country where she settled, formed a family, eventually abandoning the stages, and died in 2015. For this socio-biography, we collected and analysed public and private memory documents, a research interview and conversations with her family. To construct our analysis and strengthen a feminist perspective, we used Portuguese cinema’s History and memoirs. We both avoided mythologising and aimed at unveiling the patriarchal gaze which shapes some literature about Bárbara Virgínia. We built our questioning and analysis from Linda Alcoff’s and Teresa de Lauretis’s gender studies, from the sociology of culture by Pierre Bourdieu who Bev Skeggs borrowed for her intersection of class, gender and coloniality, alongside historical and social research about both countries’ context. The paper focuses on the artistic and familiar roles played by the filmmaker, and proposes an interpretation aimed to contribute to a fine knowledge about gender and class barriers to cultural and professional practices at that time, while it also discusses the erasure of memory about Barbara Virginia.",TRUE,FALSE,filmmaking|Portugal|the New State regime|women directors,2019-08-09T22:16:43.346853,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09T22:16:19.508273,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2y7d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2y7d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2y7d/citation/,s2y7d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2y7d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2y7d/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2y7d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4af0ef0f488d00168ea702/,5d4af0ef0f488d00168ea702,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2y7d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2y7d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2y7d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s2y7d/,https://doi.org/10.17231/comsoc.32(2017).2766,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s2y7d

This chapter addresses the commitments which Georgia has imposed on itself, be that on the basis of unilateral acts or in the framework of an international agreement, and are aimed at approximating the Georgian law to that of the EU. Obviously, in this sense, commitments undertaken under the EU-Georgia Association Agreement are of great significance. The chapter explores Georgian approach to the EU law which is reflected in unilateral acts adopted by the Georgian lawmaker. Furthermore, particular attention is given over to commitments assumed under the EU-Georgia Association Agreement, especially to preserve and respect common values and to approximate Georgian laws to EU norms. It is argued that the EU law will be — especially through the Association Agreement — a decisive factor in the further development of the Georgian legal order. GABRICHIDZE, Gaga.

A review of South Australian school uniform policy following mandated requirement for choice.,"Background: School uniform options such as skirts and dresses can impact physical activity and psychological wellbeing of girls. Restrictions that exclude trousers/pants or shorts as uniform options for girls can promote inequality in comfort and engagement in school activities. The South Australian Department of Education and Child Development (DECD) School Dress Code Procedure mandates school dress codes provide flexible uniform options with the right to choice, regardless of gender. This review examines public school adherence to DECD guidelines, and compares girls’ uniform options between public and private school sectors.

Method: The proportion of girls shorts and pants/trouser options provided in school uniform policies collated in 2018 were compared across 486 public and 193 private primary, secondary, and combined schools within South Australia. Policies were grouped based on the choice they provided girls for shorts, and separately for trousers/pants. The groups were gender specific choice/open choice, unisex choice, restricted choice, or no option.

Results: Overall, 98.6% of public and 26.4% of private school policies included shorts as a uniform option for girls. Of these schools, about nine in ten public, and just over half private, policies listed gender-specific or open choice shorts options. All public primary and high schools, and a majority of combined schools (98.8%) provided girls pants/trouser options, with 93.4% providing gender specific or open choices. This compared to 34.2% of private school policies including girls’ pants options. In total less than 1.0% of public, and 45.5% to 66.7% of private schools provide no opportunity for girls to wear shorts every day. Similarly, 56.0% of private schools do not provide any trouser/pant option.

Conclusion: The results highlight a small proportion of public schools fail to follow mandated uniform policy procedures set by the DECD, specifically in context of shorts. Moreover, this report clearly demonstrates the discrepancy in girls’ uniform options between the public and private school sectors. We present suggestions and recommendations with the aim to improve current policy, as well as a need to advance adherence to policy and South Australian anti-discrimination legislation in public and particularly private schools.",TRUE,FALSE,anti-discrimination|gender equity|girls uniform|school uniform|uniform|uniform choice,2019-08-07T12:58:22.330514,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-07T12:57:56.915382,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6b|Education|Disability and Equity in Education|Gender Equity in Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/citation/,kvwge,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4abb72272b140019eabaf1/,5d4abb72272b140019eabaf1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kvwge/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kvwge

Evolutionary game theoretic models represent individual’s thought processes by strategy update protocols. The most common of these are random mutation, individual learning, selective imitation, and myopic optimization. Recently we introduced a new strategy update protocol - foresight - which takes into account future payoffs, and how groupmates respond to one’s own strategies. Here we apply our approach to a new 2x2 game, where one player, a leader, ensures via inspection and punishment that the other player, a subordinate, produces collective good. We compare the levels of inspection and production predicted by Nash Equilibrium, Quantal Response Equilibrium, level-k cognition, fictitious play, reinforcement learning, selective imitation, and foresight. We show that only foresight and selective imitation are effective at promoting contribution by the subordinate and inspection and punishment by the leader.

The different views and interpretations of university missions relate to the development of the understanding of the role of this institution in society. In respect to this, the purpose of the article was to present, based on extensive literature review, the conceptualization of the main terms commonly used to express the university-society relations: third mission, outreach, extension, vinculación, engagement-community and civic. The research results allow us to conclude that the terms studied arise from very similar situations and purposes, namely: teaching and research missions and responsibilities of the university vis-à-vis new visions of the social pact or contract between academia, science and society.",TRUE,FALSE,extension|third mission|university and community,2019-08-07T15:14:42.215046,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-07T15:14:24.005810,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,The Authors,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36hkb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36hkb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36hkb/citation/,36hkb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36hkb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36hkb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36hkb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d49d3660f488d00178e223e/,5d49d3660f488d00178e223e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36hkb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36hkb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36hkb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/36hkb/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/36hkb

In particular, the author focuses on the Agreement’s capacity to stimulate the implementation of the EU’s “common values” and transpose the norms, general principles, and methodological approaches of EU law into the domestic legal order. It is argued that this potential depends on two elements of the “constitutional identity” of the Armenian legal order: its axiological core and its openness to external influences.

It does this by elaborating two examples -- one related to childbearing and one to childrearing -- for each of the three major paradigms in the application of evolutionary theory to human behaviour: human behavioural ecology, evolutionary psychology, and dual-inheritance theory. The examples range from a cross-cultural test of the idea that heavier female contribution to subsistence will lead to the development of more elaborate baby-carrying technology, to the demonstrated role tv-broadcasted soap operas have played in lowering fertility rates in some developing countries.",TRUE,FALSE,Cultural Evolution|Evolution|Evolutionary Psychology|Fertility|Human Behavioural Ecology|Parenting,2019-08-06T22:38:02.522977,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-06T22:37:23.368536,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,Oxford University Press,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23md/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23md/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23md/citation/,k23md,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23md/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23md/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23md/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d48c8b0b290af0016e07d18/,5d48c8b0b290af0016e07d18,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23md/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23md/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23md/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k23md/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k23md
