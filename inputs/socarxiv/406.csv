This is not a challenge that can be tackled everywhere in the same way. It is thus vital to ground the pursuit of the SDGs in locally prevalent worldviews and reflect specific contexts in developing  coherent  pathways.  In  addressing  the  need  to  couple  global  concerns  with  local aspirations and conditions, this paper introduces a stakeholder-based approach for visioning and exploring sustainable development pathways to meet the SDGs, inclusive to marginalized voices and facilitating a context-sensitive exploration of alternative futures. The approach departs from the Three horizons framework, a participatory approach developed for groups to think about transformative change. We present the benefits and challenges of the adapted approach in relation to an illustrative case study, the 2018 African Dialogue on The World In 2050, deliberating future pathways for agriculture and food systems in Africa. The key contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we detail the premises and steps of the Three Horizons for the SDGs (3H4SDG) approach. Second, we summarize the results of a pilot application of the approach -four alternative pathways for how food systems and agriculture can contribute to meeting the SDGs in Sub-Saharan Africa, integrated with the worldviews entangled in the narratives of the participating stakeholders. We conclude that participatory approaches grounded in systems thinking represent a promising way to link local aspirations with global goals.",TRUE,FALSE,2030 Agenda|imagination|planetary boundaries|scenarios|SDGs|Three horizons|transformation|TWI2050,2019-02-22T21:02:01.754951,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-22T21:01:50.213315,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/citation/,uhskb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7019748d5d98001a353494/,5c7019748d5d98001a353494,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uhskb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uhskb,NA

The impacts of interest rate on stock exchange provide important implications for monitory policy, risk management practices, financial securities valuation and government policy towards financial markets. This study seeks evidence supporting the existence of share market efficiency based on the monthly data from January 1988 to March 2003 and also shows empirical relationship between stock index and interest rate for fifteen developed and developing countries- Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippine, S. Africa, Spain, and Venezuela. Stationarity of market return is tested and found none of this stock market follows random walk model, means not efficient in weak form. To investigate the reasons of market inefficiency, relationship between share price and interest rate, and changes of share price and changes of interest rate were determined through both time series and panel regressions. For all of the countries it is found that interest rate has significant negative relationship with share price and for six countries it is found that changes of interest rate has significant negative relationship with changes of share price. So, if the interest rate is considerably controlled for these countries, it will be the great benefit of these countries’ stock exchange through demand pull way of more investors in share market, and supply push way of more extensional investment of companies.",TRUE,FALSE,Efficient Market Hypothesis|Interest Rate|Investment|Market Return|Panel stud|Random walk model,2019-02-23T23:58:09.214169,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-23T23:57:39.466354,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fket/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fket/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fket/citation/,5fket,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fket/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fket/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fket/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7003328d5d98001a3516b7/,5c7003328d5d98001a3516b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fket/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fket/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5fket/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5fket/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5fket,NA

Statistical Probability and the Rise of the Novel,"Literary scholars in the information age, whatever issues we may differ on, have long shared a belief that the amount of ""information"" in literary language is not a phenomenon that can be empirically investigated. We tell our students, and remind each other, that the meaning in literary texts is inherently subjective, culture-specific, and contextual rather than fixed. Scholar Katherine Bode reaffirms this article of faith in a new book on digital literary methodology, writing that ""literary data are inevitably constructed and transactional, whether they are explicitly designated so or not."" Long prose forms such as the novel seem especially immune to empirical assessment. As Thomas Pavel notes, the wide-open form of the novel allows ""for any imaginable kind of confabulation without constraint,"" while the fact that each reader can reinterpret and recontextualize a novel anew seems to guarantee that the meanings latent in such texts can never be fully described, much less quantified. Probably because both digital and traditional humanists hold these beliefs, most data mining, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and other distant reading methods used on fiction search for subtle patterns or relative thematic trends across time, or for faint signals of style detectable in genres or the works of individual writers.

Yeats,"Much has been said about myth, especially in relation to poetry. Contemporary studies have also revealed modern poetry’s immense interest in myth. However, only dispersed references to the potential impact the use of myth in poetry may have on nationalism have been made. Moreover, the complex interweaving of poetry and myth has been probed only in general terms, disregarding sundry aspects. Thus, this article investigates some issues pertaining to myth and poetry. Specifically, it interrogates the relationship between poetry and myth, both of which are cogently interwoven to the extent that we can hardly disassociate them. This interrogation attempts to question the role of the ubiquitous presence of myth in the poetry of William Butler Yeats. To meet this objective, this article explores the Cuchulain myth in his poems. It contends that Yeats uses this myth both as an artistic device that echoes the struggle of Irish nationalists and a means that enhances resistance.",TRUE,FALSE,|Cuchulain|functions of myth|Irish nationalism|modern poetry,2019-07-25T19:33:23.553706,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T19:33:03.000037,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj7fw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj7fw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj7fw/citation/,mj7fw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj7fw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj7fw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj7fw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6f638a8d5d98001c311a06/,5c6f638a8d5d98001c311a06,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj7fw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj7fw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mj7fw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mj7fw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mj7fw,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no1.18

Therefore, this paper attempts to explore the utilization of intertextuality in the novel entitled The Lonely Londoners (1956) by the Trinidadian postcolonial writer Sam Selvon (1923-1994). To do so, a survey on the provenance of intertextuality is displayed, with reference to its pioneers who claimed that the text is a heterogeneous combination of texts, namely Kristeva and Bakhtin. Additionally, the article introduces several models of the concept that are relevant to the analysis of the aforementioned novel along with a brief overview on the cultural and social parameters leading to its creation. This inquiry shows that The Lonely Londoners textually intertwines with a few works of the literary canon, biblical characters and eminent legal cases via some names of its characters, in addition to other direct quotations. As this paper submits, the audience should reach a rational stance on the use of intertextuality in the postcolonial novel to relate to universally shared images about racial prejudice and alienation.",TRUE,FALSE,alienation|allusion|intertextuality|literary canon|quotation|racial prejudice|Sam Selvon|The Lonely Londoners,2019-07-25T19:31:22.084559,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T19:31:02.807536,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/citation/,3qwbe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6f627782a3950017cc1e1f/,5c6f627782a3950017cc1e1f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3qwbe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3qwbe,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no1.17

Remaining true to one’s identity and being faithful to the core values of one’s culture is a complicated matter when it comes to a black living in white society like America, where color and racial identity are rudimentary prerequisites in self-definition and naming. Philip Roth’s novel entitled The Human   Stain (2000) shows how some black figures undress their black identity to wear the prestigious       white one to go onward with life as full selves, to have access to all the privileges the whites enjoy,  and, above all, to live without the specter of race and the decisiveness of epidermal signs. The novel calls into question and revision such essentialist notions as other, class,andrace by describing the crises the subject or self undergoes in the light of racial prejudices, center-periphery relations, and class stereotypes. The present paper, then, addresses the act of self-abdication the protagonist, Silk Coleman, carries out to overstep the feeling of otherness and to dodge racial discrimination. The paper looks into the notions of selfhood and Otherness by negotiating the definition of the self and the distortion it undergoes in its encounter with the Other . The study aims at revealing, primarily, the effects of Black racial-passing, a common phenomenon in American society of the first half of the twentieth century, on familial relationships and cultural heritage.  It also reveals the weight of gender and class discrimination in the individual’s identity formation and well-being.",TRUE,FALSE,Other|racial-passing|self|self-abdication|The Human Stain,2019-07-25T19:16:43.485270,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T19:16:23.513245,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vuq6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vuq6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vuq6/citation/,8vuq6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vuq6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vuq6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vuq6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6f5d8562c82a0017d9f73b/,5c6f5d8562c82a0017d9f73b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vuq6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vuq6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8vuq6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8vuq6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8vuq6,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no1
