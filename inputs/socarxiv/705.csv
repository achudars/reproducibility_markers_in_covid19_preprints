This article argues that the critical evaluation risks missing how regulators’ new tools and procedures are helping them to improve the governance of financial institutions. The focus is on the most significant novelty of the post-crisis period: regulatory stress testing. Guided by 13 interviews with regulators and financial practitioners involved in the Bank of England’s stress tests, the article addresses its ‘qualitative review’ component, which informs the supervision of the UK’s largest bank holding groups. Our findings suggest that the requirement for banks to provide a narrative account of their modelling and governance practices is changing those practices and also weakening the boundaries between banks’ epistemic subcultures. We then reflect on how the pushback against the tests points to the limits of Jens Beckert’s theorisation of the politics of expectations and requires scholars to evaluate judiciously post-crisis regulatory reforms.",TRUE,FALSE,central banks|epistemic culture|fictional expectations|financial regulation|risk modelling|stress testing,2018-07-02T10:58:13.630303,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-29T14:27:21.091644,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",Nathan Coombs and John Morris,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/citation/,jzt4m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nwsjk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/relationships/node/,nwsjk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592c2ee6594d9000441b9a84/,592c2ee6594d9000441b9a84,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jzt4m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jzt4m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jzt4m,NA

Excavated in the 1980s and 90s, it has been interpreted as an area specializing in ceramics production. This study of this area takes place in the context of an ongoing, broader project focused on the ancient town of Mandeure-Mathay (Epomanduodurum) and its surroundings, currently conducted within the framework of a PCR (collective research project). To undertake a more detailed study of the Essarté area fieldwalking surveys were carried out in 2006 and a synthesis of previous excavations, based on the available documentation, was completed in 2009. Geophysical surveys were conducted in 2009 and 2010. In addition, a LiDAR survey of Mandeure-Mathay and its surroundings realized in 2009 included the Essarté area. This paper contextualizes the data provided by excavations and aerial surveys carried in the 1980s and 90s by integrating it with the data obtained through the magnetometry survey – providing additional information on sub-surface features - and the data obtained through fieldwalking and LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) surveys - used to characterize the micro-topography of the terrain surface and associated materials in detail.

Advances in cognitive neurosciences and a suite of improved computational modeling tools, combined with the proliferation of detailed 3D models of archaeological complexes and landscapes, offer an opportunity for new approaches to these topics based on models of low level perceptual cues and visual attention. The approach described here takes aim at the question of where people will look, rather than simply what is visible, with the goal of investigating the intentions of designers of spaces, and visual aspects of the experience of a place. In simple terms, our approach involves placing detailed 3D models of built spaces or landscapes into a digital environment. An individual then virtually walks through the space and what is visible at each moment is recorded in the form of a video stream, which may be broken down into a sequence of scenes. This set of scenes is then analyzed using software that calculates and maps the visual saliency of each scene and the path of focuses of attention (FOA) over time. This set of saliency maps, raw images, and FOA paths provide the basis for further interpretation. This paper presents an initial experiment to illustrate the approach, carried out in the eastern passage at Knowth, one of the main mounds in the Brú na Bóinne in Ireland.",TRUE,FALSE,3D|archaeological method|archaeology|Visual attention,2018-07-02T10:58:13.505556,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-29T12:52:20.107134,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/citation/,73rt5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/svdn2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/relationships/node/,svdn2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592c18ca594d9000461ba66e/,592c18ca594d9000461ba66e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/73rt5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/73rt5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/73rt5,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10816-016-9310-2

Archaeology, and classical archaeology in particular, has long engaged with questions of the formation and lived experience of towns and cities. Such studies might draw on evidence of local topography, the arrangement of the built environment, and the placement of architectural details, monuments and inscriptions (e.g. Johnson and Millett 2012). Fundamental to the continued development of these studies is the growing body of evidence emerging from new excavations. Digital techniques for recording evidence “on the ground,” notably SFM (structure from motion aka close range photogrammetry) for the creation of detailed 3D models and for scene-level modeling in 3D have advanced rapidly in recent years. These parallel developments have opened the door for approaches to the study of the creation and experience of urban space driven by a combination of scene-level reconstruction models (van Roode et al. 2012, Paliou et al. 2011, Paliou 2013) explicitly combined with detailed SFM or scanning based 3D models representing stratigraphic evidence. It is essential to understand the subtle but crucial impact of the design of the user interface on the interpretation of these models. In this paper we focus on the impact of design choices for the user interface, and make connections between design choices and the broader discourse in archaeological theory surrounding the practice of the creation and consumption of archaeological knowledge. As a case in point we take the prototype interface being developed within the Gabii Project for the publication of the Tincu House. In discussing our own evolving practices in engagement with the archaeological record created at Gabii, we highlight some of the challenges of undertaking theoretically-situated user interface design, and their implications for the publication and study of archaeological materials.",TRUE,FALSE,3D|archaeology|design|digital publication|remote sensing|structure from motion,2018-07-02T10:58:13.449038,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-29T12:47:00.679907,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/citation/,pqx4j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eypv6/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/relationships/node/,eypv6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592c16bc9ad5a10048266845/,592c16bc9ad5a10048266845,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqx4j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pqx4j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pqx4j,https://doi.org/10.1515/opar-2015-0017

Bolivian cultural objects, and second because a small, poor community turned to desperate
measures to protect themselves from that illicit market due to the failings of national and
international regulation. This paper is a case study of the reality of source-end regulation of an
international criminal market in a developing country. I will discuss what is known about thefts
from Bolivian churches, the international market for items stolen from these churches, and how
such thefts are meant to be prevented on-the ground. Following this, I will present lynching in

It is clear that many of the primary centers of narcotics cultivation and transport have also experienced endemic looting of archaeological sites (e.g., Afghanistan, the Andes, Central America, and Southeast Asia) and many of the primary cen- tres for narcotics demand are also considered to be the demand end of the illicit antiquities market (e.g., the United States, Europe). The susceptibility of the market in illicit cultural objects to money laundering has been established (Bowman 2008; Brodie 1999, 2009; De Sanctis 2013; Christ and von Selle 2012; Mackenzie 2011; Ulph 2011). Of those organized trafficking groups involved in a diversified portfolio of illicit activities, most are dealing in drugs as well as other commodities (Mackenzie 2002: 2). The market prices obtained for antiq- uities seem too high for such organizations to ignore. It “makes sense” that organized criminal groups involved in drug trafficking would also engage in antiquities trafficking when it was convenient. Yet, for the most part, assertions that these two illicit markets are connected during sourcing, transit, or sale remain speculative at best.

In this chapter I will present a preliminary evaluation of existing evidence for the connection between antiquities trafficking and narcotics trafficking in Central America, particularly through the Petén department of the Republic of Guatemala, the heartland of the ancient Maya. I will begin with an overview of what is known about the historic structure of Central American antiquities looting and trafficking networks. Two phases of semi-organized and organized looting in the region are identified, the shift occurring due to changes in regu- lation and enforcement. This is followed by a discussion of the rise of narcotics trafficking in the region as it relates to post-conflict land distribution: a situ- ation that brings both narcotics traffickers and the victims of their support economies closer and closer to archaeological sites. I will then present two preliminary case studies of archaeological sites exploited, at least in part, as a result of the activities of narcotics cartels. I will conclude with a short assess- ment of what evidence exists for antiquities being looted and moved by nar- cotics traffickers and what realistic connections appear to exist between these two illicit networks.",TRUE,FALSE,antiquities|drugs|Guatemala|heritage|heritage studies|illicit antiquities|Latin America|Maya|narcotics|preservation|trafficking,2018-07-02T10:58:13.151016,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-29T11:46:03.560501,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ce9|Arts and Humanities|Latin American Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cee|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque Art and Architecture|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d31|Arts and Humanities|Museum Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/citation/,xe7p9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/twk52/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/relationships/node/,twk52,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592c08f96c613b0266c413e8/,592c08f96c613b0266c413e8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe7p9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xe7p9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xe7p9,NA

During this transformation, Maya archaeology was largely colonized, in a sense, by the American academic empire. Excavation was undertaken to further a structured concept of science and to solidify the idea of archaeology as an institutionalized discipline. The results of archaeological fieldwork on remote sites were not easily independently verified due to the constraints of the forbidding landscape and the vastness of this largely untapped resource. The known character of a particular scholar was considered to be a sufficient recommendation as to the quality of his textual archaeological record. This dependence on text resulted in a number of factual mistakes that have been repeated in publications and museum displays up to the present day. During this period in the development of the discipline, I assert that archaeological publication, not site stabilisation, was regarded as a sufficient means by which a remote site could be effectively ‘preserved’.

As a case study I will discuss early 20th century excavations within an early Classic Maya mortuary structure at the site of Holmul, Guatemala. In this extreme case, a report supposedly started by Raymond Edwin Merwin, the only archaeologist who had worked at this remote Maya city, was ‘completed’ after his untimely death by another scholar, George C. Vaillant, who had never visited the site. Due to the perceived notability of Merwin’s role in driving Maya archaeology into the realm of systematic science, Vaillant felt that the information he published was reliable and, indeed, required as the location of Holmul would effectively prevent archaeological work from being conducted there for nearly a century.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|Central America|Guatemala|history of archaeology|history of science|Maya|Mesoamerica|practice|preservation|publication,2018-07-02T10:58:13.073401,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-05-29T11:40:55.916038,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7f|Arts and Humanities|Other Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c80|Arts and Humanities|Other Languages, Societies, and Cultures|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ce9|Arts and Humanities|Latin American Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ced|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Other History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cee|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology|Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque Art and Architecture|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d31|Arts and Humanities|Museum Studies",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/citation/,xyt36,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bvwu9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/relationships/node/,bvwu9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/592c085db83f69027195df47/,592c085db83f69027195df47,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xyt36/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xyt36/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xyt36,NA
