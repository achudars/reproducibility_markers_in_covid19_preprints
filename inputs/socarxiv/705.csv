property (IP) law. In Confusion over Use: Contextualism in Trademark Law,
Graeme Dinwoodie and Mark Janis characterize it as a dispute over whether
to limit trademark holder rights in a new and unanticipated way. Yet there
is another - in our view more historically accurate - way to frame the
trademark use debate: the question is whether courts should, absent
specific statutory authorization, allow trademark holders to assert a new
and unprecedented form of trademark infringement claim. The pop-up and
keyword cases involve attempts to impose third-party liability under the
guise of direct infringement suits. Dinwoodie and Janis's thorough account
notwithstanding, it remains the fact that, before the recent spate of
Internet-related cases, no court had ever recognized a trademark claim of
the sort that trademark holders are now asserting. Trademark infringement
suits have always involved allegations of infringement by parties who use
marks in connection with the promotion of their own goods and services. The
question raised by the trademark use cases, as we view it, is whether
courts should countenance a radical departure from that traditional model
without specific instruction from Congress. We think they should not.

In this paper, we explain the origins of trademark use doctrine in
traditional limits on the scope of the trademark right and in the
distinction between direct and contributory infringement. We also explain
why we cannot simply rely on the likelihood of consumer confusion test to
solve the problems the trademark use doctrine addresses, and we examine the
difficult problem of defining the scope of the trademark use doctrine.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:55:03.620990,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:39:43.251000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/citation/,yn27k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eezc2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/relationships/node/,eezc2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcd0ee9ad5a1020668d2d4/,57bcd0ee9ad5a1020668d2d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yn27k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yn27k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yn27k

large number of suits, now a majority of all patent assertions in the
country and an even higher percentage in the information technology (IT)
industries. They win both larger judgments and larger settlements than do
“practicing entities” (“PEs”) -- those that practice patents and are not
principally in the business of collecting money from others that practice
them. And they do so despite complaints that trolls assert weak patents and
some evidence that troll patents are more likely to lose in court.

Nonetheless, we think the focus on patent trolls obscures a more complex
set of challenges confronting the patent system. In this paper, we make
three points. First, patent trolls are not a unitary phenomenon. We see at
least three different troll business models developing, and those models
have different effects on the patent system. Second, patent assertions by
practicing entities can create just as many problems as assertions by
patent trolls. The nature of many industries obscures some of the costs of
those assertions, but that does not mean they are cost-free. In addition,
practicing entities are increasingly engaging in “patent privateering,” in
which product-producing companies take on many of the attributes of trolls.
Put differently, while trolls exploit problems with the patent system, they
are not the only ones that do so. Third, many of the problems associated
with trolls are in fact problems that stem from the disaggregation of
complementary patents into too many different hands. That in turn suggests
that groups like Intellectual Ventures might be reducing, not worsening,
these problems (though, as we will see, the overall effects are ambiguous),
while “patent privateers” that spin off patents in order for others to
assert them might make things worse. For this reason, patent reformers and
antitrust authorities should worry less about aggregation of patent rights
and more about disaggregation of those rights, sometimes accomplished by
spinning them out to others.

Understanding the economics of patent assertions by both trolls and
practicing entities allows us to move beyond labels and the search for “bad
actors,” focusing instead on aspects of the patent system itself that give
rise to the problems and on specific, objectionable conduct in which both
trolls and practicing entities sometimes engage. Patent trolls alone are
not the problem; they are a symptom of larger problems with the patent
system. Treating the symptom will not solve the problems. In a very real
sense, critics have been missing the forest for the trolls. Exposing the
larger problems allows us to contemplate changes in patent law that will
actually tackle the underlying pathologies of the patent system and the
abusive conduct they enable.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:52:04.293654,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:31:09.579000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/citation/,r5nfd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gm4ur/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/relationships/node/,gm4ur,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcceae9ad5a101f868d4c7/,57bcceae9ad5a101f868d4c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r5nfd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r5nfd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r5nfd

Internet backbone providers, online marketplaces, and search engines -
process hundreds of millions of data transfers every day, and host or link

Some of this content is illegal. In the last 12 years, both Congress and
the courts have concluded that Internet intermediaries should not be liable
for a wide range of content posted or sent through their systems by
another. The reasoning behind these immunities is impeccable: if Internet
intermediaries were liable every time someone posted problematic content on
the Internet, the resulting threat of liability and effort at rights
clearance would debilitate the Internet.

While the logic of some sort of safe harbor for Internet intermediaries is
clear, the actual content of those safe harbors is not. Rather, the safe
harbors actually in place are a confusing and illogical patchwork. For some
claims, the safe harbors are absolute. For others, they preclude damages
liability but not injunctive relief. For still others they are dependent on
the implementation of a ""notice and takedown"" system. And for at least a
few types of claims, there is no safe harbor at all. This patchwork makes
no sense. In this article, I suggest that it be replaced with a uniform
safe harbor rule. A single, rationally designed safe harbor based on the

leads me to write a paper with such a provocative title. The first
development is the rise of hold-up as a primary component of patent
litigation and patent licensing. The second development in the last three
decades is the massive surge in university patenting. At the confluence of
these developments is a growing frustration on the part of industry with
the role of universities as patent owners. Time and again, when I talk to
people in a variety of industries, their view is that universities are the
new patent trolls.

In this paper, I argue that Universities should take a broader view of
their role in technology transfer. University technology transfer ought to
have as its goal maximizing the social impact of technology, not merely
maximizing the university's licensing revenue. Sometimes those goals will
coincide with the university's short-term financial interests. Sometimes
universities will maximize the impact of an invention on society by
granting exclusive licenses for substantial revenue to a company that will
take the invention and commercialize it. Sometimes, but not always. At
other times a non-exclusive license, particularly on a basic enabling
technology, will ultimately maximize the invention's impact on society by
allowing a large number of people to commercialize in different areas, to
try out different things and see if they work, and the like. University
policies might be made more nuanced than simply a choice between exclusive
and nonexclusive licenses. For example, they might grant field-specific
exclusivity, or exclusivity only for a limited term, or exclusivity only
for commercial sales while exempting research, and they might condition
continued exclusivity on achievement of certain dissemination goals.
Finally, particularly in the software context, there are many circumstances
in which the social impact of technology transfer is maximized either by
the university not patenting at all or by granting licenses to those
patents on a royalty-free basis to all comers.

Finally, I think we can learn something about the raging debate over who's
a patent troll and what to do about trolls by looking at university
patents. Universities are non-practicing entities. They share some
characteristics with trolls, at least if the term is broadly defined, but
they are not trolls. Asking what distinguishes universities from trolls can
actually help us figure out what concerns us about trolls. What we ought to
do is abandon the search for a group of individual companies to define as
trolls. In my view, troll is as troll does. Universities will sometimes be
bad actors. Nonmanufacturing patent owners will sometimes be bad actors.

prices at which anyone else sold a share of stock. If you wanted to buy (or
sell) a share of stock, you'd have to guess what it was worth. The result,
everyone would agree, would be massively inefficient. Willing buyers and
sellers would often miss each other. Patents, however, exist in just such a
blind market. Want to know if you're getting a good deal on a patent
license, or acquiring rights in a technology? Too bad. Even if that patent
or ones like it have been licensed dozens of times before, the terms of
those licenses, including the price itself, will almost invariably be
confidential. Patent owners who want to put their rights up for sale face
the same problem.

The result? Willing licensors and licensees can't find each other. Patent
auctions often fizzle, because without a thick market - one with an array
of buyers and sellers bidding on price - no one can know whether they are
getting a steal or being had. When parties do license patents, the prices
are (to the extent we can tell) all over the map. And the rest of the world
has no idea what those prices are. This in turn means that courts lack
adequate benchmarks to determine a ¿reasonable royalty¿ when companies
infringe patents.

The solution is straightforward: require publication of patent assignment
and license terms. Doing so won't magically make the market for patents
work like a stock exchange; there will still be significant uncertainty
about whether a patent is valid and what it covers. But it will permit the
aggregate record of what companies pay for rights to signal what particular
patents are worth and how strong they are, just as derivative financial
instruments allow markets to evaluate and price other forms of risk. It
will help rationalize patent transactions, turning them from secret,
one-off negotiations into a real, working market for patents. And by making
it clear to courts and the world at large what the normal price is for
patent rights, it will make it that much harder for a few unscrupulous
patent owners to hold up legitimate innovators, and for established
companies to systematically infringe the rights of others.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:48:26.766705,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:23:06.641000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/citation/,c286x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/djm3z/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/relationships/node/,djm3z,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcccce6c613b01ead93303/,57bcccce6c613b01ead93303,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c286x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c286x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c286x
