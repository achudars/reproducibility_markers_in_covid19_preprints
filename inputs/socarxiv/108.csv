Due to the significance of pronunciation of consonant clusters, which are almost absent from Arabic, this work attempts to find the extent to which beginner and advanced English majors accept or reject permissible and impermissible sounds combinations in the onset position. It also attempts to find whether there are any intervening factors that could influence students’ perception of English phonotactics. The focus was on the consonant clusters occurring in onset position. These clusters included two-sound and three-sound clusters starting the word. Most of the words were pseudowords, and the focus was on whether the students would accept or reject these sounds, and whether there was a significant difference between beginner and advanced students, male and female. The paper also considered some intervening factors that could have influenced students' performance. To this end, the researcher conducted a survey to test the perception and rejection of certain sounds in some carefully selected pseudowords. The findings showed that most advanced students scored better in permissible sounds while the results were close in the impermissible sounds. There were some factors that could have had some impact on the results, such as living in an English-speaking community, watching English TV, and listening to the news in English.

Therefore, the study aims to investigate the effect of languages of instruction in Morocco (e.g., Arabic vs. French) on the receptive vocabulary size of EFL Moroccan master students (e.g., departments of letters, science, and law). To this end, Meara’s (2010) Yes/No test was used as an instrument to measure the overall vocabulary size of these participants. A total of 325 EFL master students took the aforementioned test. The main research question is: Does the medium of instruction have any effects on the receptive vocabulary size of these students?  Descriptive statistics were employed to calculate the overall receptive vocabulary size of test-takers. It was found that Moroccan EFL master students have a total of (M= 2293) lemmas. An independent samples t-test was run to check for any statistical significance. The t-test statistic reveals that the significance level is less than the p-value (t=-4.068, p&lt; .05, df= 323). Thus, it was concluded that there was a statistically significant difference between the French group and the Arabic group. The results of this study confirm that students who were instructed in French (M= 2417, sd= 903, N=185) outperformed the other students who were taught in Arabic (M= 2058, sd= 903, N= 140).

Eighty-one instructors in the Department of English at Imam Mohammad ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU) participated in the study. This study provides data related to the teachers' perceptions concerning Internet use, areas and barriers in language teaching. The study aimed to answer two research questions. Namely, what are the perceived obstacles to implementing Internet-based English as a foreign language teaching (EFL) teaching from the viewpoint of English Department instructors at IMSIU?  And what are IMSIU English Department’s instructors’ perceived needs for training in using the Internet for language teaching? A survey and a semi-structured interview were used to collect the data. The survey involved three sections; the first section enquired about whether participants’ need training on using the Internet in language teaching, the second section investigated the areas of potential training, and the last section investigated participants’ barriers in incorporating the Internet in language instruction. The interviews involved three questions for further understanding. The findings showed that the perceived obstacles include cheating in online exams, lack of knowledge in using some applications, restricted time of some applications, and making online exams. The instructors demonstrated their eagerness to training. They also perceived presentation software, creating online exams, creating teaching materials, Videoconferencing, and teaching techniques, online classroom management, managing data sources, online assessment and evaluation, and basic knowledge of using technology as very necessary.

In this regard, the researchers try to determine the reasons and functions behind the use of Code-Switching among EFL teachers and students of English to Algerian Arabic. To conduct this research work, the researchers collected data through an interview that was conducted with 16 teachers of Comprehension and Oral Expression, Literature, and Civilization in the Department of English at Tlemcen University in Algeria, and supported by a classroom observation of students with the same teachers. Findings revealed that the use of Algerian Arabic is inevitable. Teachers’ responses exhibit negative attitudes towards English-Algerian Arabic code-switching in class, but they do not deny its integration as a pedagogical necessity to explain difficult words and expressions that are hard to be grasped in the target language. The results also showed that teachers peacefully attempt to get their students accustomed to lectures delivered in English solely by avoiding translation and applying the direct method of TEFL.

Accordingly, the Kingdom strategizes to implement this transformative Vision. The current research aims to analyze how American media has reported several events, actions, and policies in line with Saudi Vision 2030. Thus, the question posed is how an image of the transformative Saudi Kingdom has been presented by American media discourse, in line with Vision 2030. The study is substantial for the Kingdom to ascertain how the world has responded to its Vision. Moreover, in a world with media as a dominant directing agency, it is imperious for the Kingdom to keep an eye on its image in the global community. The research is primarily a quantitative study based on the corpus approach to study the designated media discourse. A specialized corpus of 150,000 words is compiled and analyzed through a variety of corpus tools. The results reveal that American newspapers have given limited representation of the Vision and related activities. Their media usually highlights the pre-existing features of the Kingdom. On the other hand, there are very occasional references to some new aspects like the transformation of the economy, promotion of tourism, revision of the society, etc., which are being implemented in the Kingdom.

However, it is observed that due attention is not devoted to developing speaking skills in Saudi EFL learners; this task is especially challenging as English is not widely used or spoken in their day-to-day communication. The current study aims to investigate the psychological factors which affect learners’ speaking performance by: (a) examining the strategies learners use for developing speaking skills, (b) identifying obstacles confronted by learners in developing speaking skills, and (c) suggesting ways to facilitate the acquisition of English speaking skills. The research seeks answers to these questions: (1) What are some psychological factors affecting speaking skills of students? (2) Why do learners find speaking in English so difficult? . I distributed a questionnaire among 200 female and male participants majoring in various fields at Majmaah university in Saudi Arabia. I employed SPSS to analyze the accumulated data and displayed the results in descriptive tables. The results reveal that affective factors impacting students’ performance in speaking skills are shyness, peer pressure, anxiety, and fear of making mistakes. Other factors that hinder speaking performance are paucity of necessary vocabulary, lack of exposure to the target language, and scarce opportunities to practice speaking outside the classroom. The study contributes to the existing English language learning (ELL) literature through its focus on the affective factors impacting speaking performance in Arabic-speaking EFL learners.",TRUE,FALSE,affective factors|language learners|motivation|speaking performance|teaching strategies,2021-01-14T00:27:23.037423,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13T23:29:53.626743,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unbtq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unbtq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unbtq/citation/,unbtq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unbtq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unbtq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unbtq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fff79e7ba010904f1890157/,5fff79e7ba010904f1890157,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unbtq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unbtq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/unbtq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/unbtq/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/unbtq

The present paper deals with the lexicosemantic characteristics of multi-word lexical units multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, epidural abscess, Huntington’s chorea, and carpal tunnel syndrome. The research questions focus on collocations, word combinations, and concordances in which they regularly appear; the first lemma to the left and the first lemma to the right from the studied lexeme demonstrate the principal positions of our interest. Simultaneously, the researcher considers their semantic restrictions, semantic prosody, and grammatical relations that influence their lexical features. The whole linguistic material is investigated in the framework of the text corpus English Web 2015 (enTenTen15) with the help of the search tool Sketch Engine. To begin the research, the frequencies of these lexical units are elaborated. The researcher also looks into the morphological classification of the studied words as these two factors affect them from the lexicological perspective. The research outcomes confirm that the nervous disease names appear in a wide range of structures, and they considerably contribute to successful communication in the medical surroundings. Moreover, the results indicate that the lexicosemantic behaviour of the terms reflects extralinguistic factors (psychological, social) of individual communication acts. The phenomenon is to be further examined and interpreted within the corpus analyses of other chosen lexical units, not only from the field of medicine. Eventually, the researcher outlines possible pedagogical implications of the research results in the process of teaching English.",TRUE,FALSE,collocation|concordance|corpus-based analysis|lemma|lexicosemantics|meaning|nervous system disease names,2021-01-14T00:28:07.157370,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13T23:30:08.564077,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk8p9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk8p9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk8p9/citation/,nk8p9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk8p9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk8p9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk8p9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fff7915e80d370509a56a40/,5fff7915e80d370509a56a40,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk8p9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk8p9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk8p9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nk8p9/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nk8p9

The aim of this critical review is to answer some questions relating to identifying the most common themes of research efforts in this area, the strengths, and weaknesses among it; and to explain how such efforts have contributed to the development of English language learning/teaching within the Saudi context. The study is significant in that the findings identified some issues with thematic orientation in Saudi EFL emotion research—particularly regarding under- and over-explored topics due to an element of randomness in how research topics related to EFL emotions are often selected and explored, with some topic areas receiving excessive attention and others receiving little or no attention. Some issues related to research design and methodology were also acknowledged and assessed. The study suggests that it is useful to develop ways to coordinate and streamline future research on EFL emotions in Saudi Arabia and to work towards developing new research protocols that investigate the practicalities of language learning emotions in real learning situations.",TRUE,FALSE,anxiety|attitudes|EFL learning/teaching|emotion|motivation|Saudi Arabia,2021-01-14T00:28:44.728486,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13T23:30:33.581552,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ej5sn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ej5sn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ej5sn/citation/,ej5sn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ej5sn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ej5sn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ej5sn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fff7822ba010904e6891cce/,5fff7822ba010904e6891cce,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ej5sn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ej5sn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ej5sn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ej5sn/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.3,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ej5sn
