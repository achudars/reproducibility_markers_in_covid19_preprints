Unsustainable wildlife use is one of the leading threats to earth’s biodiversity. Historically, efforts to address this issue have been focused on increasing enforcement and anti-poaching measures. 
2.	However, recognition that such supply-reduction measures may be inefficient has spurred a movement towards consumer research and behavior change. Here, we used consumer research to investigate the consumption of bear bile and gallbladder in Cambodia. 
3.	Our aim was to gather key consumer insights such as demographics, beliefs, and the identification of trusted individuals and communication channels, which could be used to underpin future behavior change efforts to reduce the consumption of bear bile and gallbladder. To accomplish this, we conducted 4,512 structured quantitative interviews and 132 qualitative, semi-structured interviews across Cambodia. 
4.	We found that although the level of bear bile and gallbladder consumption varied across the country, consumers were largely homogenous in their beliefs and influencers. This indicates that behavior change interventions grounded in these results may be effective in any of the eight areas surveyed.

There is rising interest globally in inequality in the distribution and accessibility of urban greenspace. In particular, it is increasingly realised that overarching social and political inequalities can lead to less well-off areas having less or lower-quality greenspace, and thus being less likely to draw down the social and environmental resilience benefits provided by urban greenspace. We evaluate the relationship between neighbourhood-level deprivation and greenspace quality by combining socio-economic data with assessment of neighbourhood greenspace taken from Google Street View, subjecting our observations to statistical testing. We find that on nearly all measures of greenspace quality, there is a statistically significant correlation between deprivation and greenspace quality, with more disadvantaged areas having lower-quality greenspace. This finding is consistent with much existing research. However, we make a contribution to the international literature by showing it is not only the presence or extent of greenspace, but also the characteristics within greenspaces, that vary with deprivation. As existing research suggests greenspace attributes such as tranquillity, greenness and perceived safety are important to unlock the health, wellbeing and resilience benefits that greenspace provides, this is a notable finding. We conclude by arguing that there is a need to go further than simply identifying inequalities, and instead use studies such as ours as a point of departure for imagining wider planning and social policy measures aimed at understanding and addressing underpinning inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,deprivation|equality|Glasgow|greenspace|justice,2020-09-25T10:19:44.535546,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-25T10:19:20.642560,FALSE,NA,available,NA,"https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/SIMD|https://glasgowgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=d94b9f705a8441768cb90f04f7932e57|https://www.google.com/maps/@55.8456186,-4.2298859,1421m/data=!3m1!1e3",no,,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9jeh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9jeh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9jeh/citation/,d9jeh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9jeh/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9jeh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9jeh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6cfd9046080902301ac547/,5f6cfd9046080902301ac547,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9jeh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9jeh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9jeh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d9jeh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d9jeh,NA

It argues that the German government’s decisions to eliminate protections for Landesbanks increased competitive pressure for public banks, increased the propensity for those banks to adopt risky strategies in order to maximize profits. These actions by Landesbanks and large private banks exposed German households and firms to greater risk and financial vulnerability, and indirectly exposed European financial systems to subprime mortgage risk.  It uses balance sheet analysis for different sectors of German finance to show that Landesbanks and Germany’s large private banks adopted higher risk asset and liabilities, engaged in more international activity, and shifted from lending to security acquisition while competing for profits, while Sparkassen, small public savings banks, did not adopt such risky strategies, and successfully shielded German households and small businesses from credit market spillovers following the Global Financial Crisis.

Patents, an often vital precursor to a commercialised innovation, share this heterogeneous quality distribution. A pertinent question then arises: How should we define and measure patent quality? Accepting that different stakeholders have different views of this concept, we take a multi-dimensional view of patent quality in this work. We first test the consistency of popular post-grant outcomes that are often used as patent quality measures. Finding these measures to be generally inconsistent, we then use a raft of patent indicators that are defined at the time of grant to dissect the characteristics associated with different post-grant outcomes. We find broad disagreement in the relative importance of individual characteristics between outcomes and, further, significant variation of the same across technologies within outcomes. We conclude that measurement of patent quality is highly sensitive to both stakeholder viewpoint and technology type.

Tutkimusnäyttö perustuu vahvasti koulukyselyaineistoihin kuten PISA-aineistoon, jossa vanhempien koulutuksen ja ammattiasema on kysytty lapsilta. Tällaiset kyselyaineistot ovat alttiita vastausharhan aiheuttamalle mittausvirheelle. Tässä tutkimuksessa osoitamme, että PISA-aineistot sisältävät suurta mittausvirhettä vanhempien koulutuksen osalta. Siksi vanhemman ammattiasema on luotettavampi mittari, kun halutaan tutkia kotitaustan yhteyttä oppimistuloksiin PISA-aineistolla. Kun mittausvirhe ja negatiivinen valikoituminen vuosien välillä huomioidaan, oppimistulosten eriarvoisuus ei ole kasvanut Suomessa viime vuosina. / According to previous studies, the inequality of learning outcomes according to family background has increased in Finland in recent years. The evidence is strongly based on school surveys such as PISA data, where children are asked about their parental educational and occupation status. However, such surveys are prone to measurement error due to reporting bias. We show that the PISA data contain a large measurement error in terms of parental education. Therefore, parental occupational status is a more reliable indicator of family background when association between family background and learning outcomes are studied with PISA data. When the measurement error and the negative selection are taken into account, the results show that the inequality of learning outcomes has not increased in Finland in recent years.",TRUE,FALSE,family background|Inequality of learning outcomes|intergenerational effects|kotitausta|measurement error|mittausvirhe|oppimistulosten eriarvoisuus|PISA-aineisto|PISA data|ylisukupolvisuus,2020-09-23T17:01:20.804447,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-23T17:00:58.924015,FALSE,NA,no,Available for PISA data.,,no,No preregistration.,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Hannu Lehti|Markus Laaninen,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrhqc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrhqc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrhqc/citation/,zrhqc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrhqc/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrhqc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrhqc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6ad62f46080901501b24e2/,5f6ad62f46080901501b24e2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrhqc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrhqc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zrhqc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zrhqc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zrhqc,NA

These projections, based on a vast amount of data, complex estimates and models, have gained high visibility, also in subsequent media coverage and interviews. Yet, IHME highly publicised population data and scenarios suffer from numerous issues with the underlying data, models and scenarios as well as over-simplistic interpretations of their results. This study aims to substantiate our concerns, spelled out earlier in a letter to the Lancet (Basten, Sobotka et al. 2020), and review major issues and weaknesses with IHME projections and their interpretation. First, we critically examine the data issues, models and their underlying assumptions, including implausible uncertainty intervals and contrasts in predicted trends among countries from broader regions, which often share similar economic and cultural characteristics. Second, we discuss the interpretations of the main findings presented in the discussion part of the paper by Vollset et al. and reflect on the media representation of the projection results. In conclusion, we highlight internal inconsistencies in the IHME modelling approach, which lead to questionable projections for many countries and scenarios.",TRUE,FALSE,demography|fertility|GBD|Global Burden of Disease|IHME|Lancet|migration|mortality|population|population forecasts|population projections|population scenarios,2020-09-23T16:58:21.869188,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-23T16:57:55.994569,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/ytf6m/?view_only=0f9e2cd954af4a48a3ee68f16f76757e,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/citation/,5syef,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f6ac9b146080901511b218d/,5f6ac9b146080901511b218d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5syef/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5syef/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5syef,NA
