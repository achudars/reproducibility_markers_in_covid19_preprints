The paper stands on the claim that a deprivation measure can be adequate, both conceptually and empirically, to capture poverty in the EU defined in Townsendian terms. Yet existing deprivation scales have three conceptual problems such as data-driven specification, neglected dimensionality and missing dimensions, and four data problems such as limited extent, cross-cultural equivalization, behavioral choices and reporting error. To address conceptual problems, I offer a concept-led methodology for constructing a multidimensional measure. To address data problems, I apply a post-hoc adjustment strategy using dual criteria of income poverty and financial strain. The proposed measure has four dimensions, namely needs for basic goods, health, education, leisure and social relationships, where each dimension is evaluated separately with relevant scales. When compared to the formal EU 2020 poverty target measure, the proposed measure is more likely to capture people with needs and lower resources as well as those in less affluent countries than those in more affluent countries. The (adjusted) proposed measure can be used as a stand-alone indicator to identify a target population for policy; or the unadjusted proposed measure can be combined with an income poverty measure to identify a worst-off group within that target population.",TRUE,FALSE,income vs. deprivation measures|Material deprivation|measurement validity|missing dimensions|Multidimensional poverty|needs for education|needs for healthcare|needs for leisure|needs for social relationships|Poverty measurement|Unmet needs,2018-09-19T06:11:41.430410,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-19T06:11:26.047615,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7prxq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7prxq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7prxq/citation/,7prxq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7prxq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d3f6p/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7prxq/relationships/node/,d3f6p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7prxq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ba16c94828a240018e4c788/,5ba16c94828a240018e4c788,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7prxq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7prxq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7prxq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7prxq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7prxq,NA

works of Hans Jonas and Martin Drenthen, understood as a correlate of
our technological capacity, as well as a relationship to the possibility of
meaningfulness today and in the indefinite future. It is argued that we are

Theoretical models suggest that complex cultural adaptations can arise from an optimal mix of (i) individual learning that is of sufficient accuracy plus (ii) social learning that is of sufficiently high fidelity and is payoff- biased. Here I review the findings of a series of experimental studies of human learning, designed to simulate the kind of technology-based tasks that our ancestors would have faced. Results of these studies support the predictions of the models, and show that contemporary humans’ learning strategies are broadly adaptive. Performance typically improved through effective individual learning and payoff-biased social learning. The latter crucially allowed participants to escape low-fitness locally optimal artifact designs and jump to higher-fitness designs, assuming a realistic multimodal adaptive landscape underlying artifact fitness. On the other hand, people also exhibited predictable flaws in their learning, such as the copying of neutral traits exhibited by successful models along with their functional traits (i.e. cultural hitchhiking), and an unwillingness to share information with others under certain circumstances.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|evolutionary archaeology|social learning,2018-09-18T02:46:42.287390,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-18T02:46:25.389036,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/citation/,gn7pa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nbkvy/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/relationships/node/,nbkvy,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9fbfeb689e1e00179d908d/,5b9fbfeb689e1e00179d908d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gn7pa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gn7pa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gn7pa,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-4-431-54553-8_8

I provide county-level population projections by age, sex, and race in five-year intervals for the period 2015-2100 for all U.S. counties. Using historic U.S. census data in temporally rectified county boundaries and race groups for the period 1990-2015, I calculate cohort-change ratios (CCRs) and cohort-change differences (CCDs) for eighteen five-year age groups (0-85+), two sex groups (Male and Female), and four race groups (White NH, Black NH, Other NH, Hispanic) for all U.S counties.

One of the earliest criticisms of E O Wilson’s sociobiology project was the focus on presumed genetically evolved behavioural universals, and lack of attention to cultural diversity and cultural (as opposed to genetic) history. As sociobiology split into different fields during the 1980s, each developed their own approaches and assumptions. Human behavioural ecologists employed the ‘phenotypic gambit’, assuming that culture is a proximate means by which natural selection generates currently-adaptive behavioural strategies. Evolutionary psychologists distinguished between transmitted and evoked culture, the former involving the social transmission of information, the latter involving the triggering of genetically-prespecified behaviours in response to different environmental cues (typically ancestral cues, such that behaviour may no longer be currently adaptive). Evoked culture has been the focus of most research in evolutionary psychology. Cognitive anthropologists have a similar notion of ‘cultural attraction’, where universal aspects of cognition evoke predictable responses due to individual learning. Finally, cultural evolution (or gene-culture coevolution) approaches stress the causal role of transmitted culture. Here, human cognition is assumed to be relatively domain-general and content-free, with genetic evolution having shaped social learning processes to allow the rapid spread of locally adaptive knowledge (although occasionally allowing the spread of maladaptive behaviour, due to the partial decoupling of genetic and cultural evolution). All the while, the traditional social sciences have remained steadfastly unwilling to accept that evolutionary approaches to human behaviour have any merit or relevance, and indeed have abandoned the scientific method in favour of more politically motivated interpretive methods. Most curiously, the social sciences have abandoned the concept of culture, as they define it. I will discuss all of these approaches in terms of (i) the extent to which they give causal weight to genetic inheritance, individual learning and social learning, and how these process interact; (ii) their assumptions about the domain-specificity of human cognition; (iii) ultimate-proximate causation; (iv) specific debates over language evolution, cooperation and the demographic transition; and (v) prospects for reconciliation and integration of these tensions across the evolutionary human sciences and the social sciences more broadly.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|culture|evolutionary psychology|human behavioural ecology|sociobiology,2018-09-18T02:44:21.666294,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-18T02:44:07.307414,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Biological Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",Alex Mesoudi,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/citation/,epdfv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kjn38/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/relationships/node/,kjn38,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9faeec63caf90019c2e72f/,5b9faeec63caf90019c2e72f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/epdfv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/epdfv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/epdfv,NA

A theoretical reassessment and empirical analysis of the value of motivation in the labor market","Inequality has often been explained by stable individual traits or by the structural features of labor markets. This study argues that we also should consider task involvement when we account for labor market inequality. Three mechanisms derived from experimental research link task involvement to performance: individuals involved in tasks are more focused on the work process, are more dedicated to mastery and problem-solving, and have stronger product quality perseverance. Despite the significance of task involvement as a motivation, its potential implication for labor market inequality is so far rather unacknowledged. We aim to develop its theoretical implications in the labor market context and test the expectation that task involvement is related to wage attainment by analyzing representative data for Sweden (LNU) and Europe (ESS). We theoretically locate our account within relational sociology, emphasizing that wage inequality is determined by interactions between worker attributes and the features of work organizations.",TRUE,FALSE,Intrinsic motivation|Labor market inequality|Labor market performance|Task involvement|Wages|Work motivation,2018-09-18T02:41:22.792835,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-18T02:41:05.849071,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb2sd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb2sd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb2sd/citation/,kb2sd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb2sd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vwtxr/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb2sd/relationships/node/,vwtxr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb2sd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b9fa0a2420bc00018df08be/,5b9fa0a2420bc00018df08be,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb2sd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb2sd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kb2sd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kb2sd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kb2sd,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2018.08.007
