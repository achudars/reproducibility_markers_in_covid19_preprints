Drawing on data from historical archives, original interviews, and ethnography, I examine two cases—one rural and one urban—of boom and bust in a now-defunct, Midwestern iron and steel commodity chain. From this data, I ask how and why natural resources remain ideologically and economically central to post-industrial communities. I demonstrate how the mobility of capital reproduces environmental, economic, and social inequalities.
This project revises our understanding of natural resource commodification by probing the tensions between the political economies of industrial capitalism and the place-based nature of social life. Specifically, I argue that post-deindustrialization, the commodification of nature continues to shape land use, infrastructures, and residents’ imaginaries of community identity and economic development. My argument is as follows. First, I draw on historical data to demonstrate how natural resource capitalism not only takes place, but it makes place. I show how the historical political economies of land use constructed persistent infrastructures and ideologies in the communities central to my study. Contemporary interviews reveal how long-term residents contemplate the past as they narrate their identities, reasons for staying, and ideal futures in their de-industrialized communities. Finally, I interrogate contemporary conflicts between possible revivals of industry and a new generation of tourism built on other “natural resources.” This project sheds light on why certain communities continue to center their identities, economic prospects, and perceptions of nature around the concept of natural resources, and offers wide-reaching implications concerning addressing structural and cultural components of human-environment decision-making.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-03-13T13:31:48.086466,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-13T13:30:26.391818,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/citation/,dhg54,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c86e02666b44d001c742015/,5c86e02666b44d001c742015,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dhg54/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dhg54/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dhg54,NA

In 2012, the question was changed with the inclusion of an additional response option describing uncertainty about pregnancy desire prior to the pregnancy. This analysis investigates how this additional response option affected women’s responses.
Methods: We use the change in the pregnancy intention question in 2012 as a natural experiment, taking advantage of relatively stable distributions of pregnancy intentions over short periods of time within states. Using PRAMS data from 2009-2014 (N=222,781), we employ a regression discontinuity design to test for differences in the proportion of women choosing each response option in the periods pre- and post-question change. 
Results: In the years 2012-2014, 13-15% of women chose the new answer option, “I wasn’t sure what I wanted”. The addition had a substantial impact on distributions of pregnancy intentions, drawing responses away from all answer choices except for “I wanted to become pregnant then.” Effects were not uniform across age, parity and race combined with Hispanic ethnicity, as well as across states.
Conclusions: These effects could impact estimated levels and trends of the proportion of births that are characterized as intended, mistimed or unwanted, as well as estimates of differences between demographic groups.

We provide a new actor-centric approach to explicitly model strategic interdependence in multi-actor civil wars. We argue that competitive dynamics dominate strategic behavior between rebel organizations, but these can be offset by incentives to free-ride in cases where the underlying incompatibility displays public good characteristics. Based on a network game theoretic model, we derive a statistical framework that allows for a direct test of strategic interdependence. We find that the estimated duration interdependence is positive, that is weaker in secessionist conflicts, and that modeling this interdependence explicitly outweighs existing empirical measures of interdependence (e.g. number of organizations). Finally, we demonstrate that the model fit of rebel organizations' fighting durations can be improved by taking strategic interdependence into account.",TRUE,FALSE,civil war|duration|network analysis|rebel organizations,2019-03-11T17:35:47.316784,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-11T17:35:16.991952,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/citation/,gz7xb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/65vp7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/relationships/node/,65vp7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8677451d7381001ac04780/,5c8677451d7381001ac04780,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7xb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gz7xb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gz7xb,NA

To address this gap, we aim to identify factors that influence bystanders’ risk of being physically victimized. Methods: We observed bystander behavior from video surveillance footage of naturally occurring violence in night-time economy settings, and data was analyzed with a logistic regression model. Results: Data shows that approximately one out of six interventions results in some type of victimization, typically with a relatively low degree of severity. The bystander’s social group membership, the setting of the emergency, and the bystander’s intervention type are estimated as risk factors for victimization.

In this paper, we evaluate a two-year field experiment in an apparel factory to analyze altered compensation systems designed to increase worker pay while supporting factory goals around productivity and profitability. Using a quasi-experimental design, with unique data on wages, hours, productivity, quality, and worker engagement, we estimate the impact of three altered compensation systems on pay, productivity, and factory profits. The compensation systems can be described as: 1) an improved productivity-based scheme, 2) a scheme that brings quality and waste reduction into the calculation; and 3) a “target wage” scheme. Overall, the treatments raised wages by 4.2-9.7% and increased productivity by 8-10% points. Management reported significant financial benefits from the experiment, including increased profits for five of six lines, and avoided costs and productivity losses due to decreased turnover. The factory workers, through focus-group interviews before, during, and after the intervention, reported improved relations with team members and managers. This study demonstrates altered factory compensation can support better factory performance and a better paid workforce, indicating a path towards advanced supply chains with improved wages.",TRUE,FALSE,apparel|compensation systems|Lean|value chains|worker wages,2019-03-11T00:14:22.258607,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-11T00:13:59.755853,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/citation/,ntj3f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c82f5541d73810019bdfced/,5c82f5541d73810019bdfced,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ntj3f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ntj3f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ntj3f,NA

The use of public opinion as a variable in empirical research poses special challenges. In this article I suggest that the logic and methods inherent in the art of structural equation modeling provide opportunities to overcome some of these challenges. I describe this type of logic as it pertains to measurement error, context effects and endogeneity. Using General Social Survey data for the United States and taking thermostatic feedback models as an example, I demonstrate why it is important for policy scholars to attend to (a) measurement modeling and cross-level isomorphism, (b) shocks that might bias survey response patterns and (c) endogeneity implied by the theoretically reciprocal nature of opinion and policy feedback. These examples come with discussions of why scholars should pay attention to model specification so that theory and empirics are in unison and how to perform model fitting and testing to better develop theories and models of policy processes.",TRUE,FALSE,General Social Survey|Public Opinion|Social Policy|Structural Equation Modeling|Thermostatic Feedback|United States,2019-03-09T11:44:46.949777,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-09T11:44:15.849115,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/citation/,48fye,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vu3s5/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/relationships/node/,vu3s5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c826f941d73810017be252a/,5c826f941d73810017be252a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/48fye/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/48fye/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/48fye,NA
