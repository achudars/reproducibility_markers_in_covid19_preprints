Drawing on three months of ethnographic data collection, I find that working-class male youth intellectualize pro-gay attitudes and that homophobic language is almost entirely absent from the setting. I document the presence of homosocial tactility, as well as the valuing of friendship and emotional closeness. However, these behaviours are less pronounced than documented among middle-class boys, and I use these findings to advance understanding of how class influences the development of inclusive attitudes and behaviours.

We show that the majority of participants use pup play for sexual satisfaction. It is also a form of relaxation, demonstrated primarily through the existence of a “headspace.”  We classify pup play as a kink, and find no evidence for the framing of it as a form of zoophilia.

Methods: A mixed methods approach was used, consisting of a review of a sample of unresolved homicides, a comparative analysis of the frequency of known serial homicide series and unresolved serial homicide series, and semi-structured interviews of experts.
Results: The past decade contained almost half the cases (13%) that existed at the 1980s peak of serial homicide (27%). Only 282 (1.3%) strangled females made up the 22,444 unresolved homicides reviewed. Most expert respondents thought it unreasonable that any meaningful proportion of missing persons cases are victims of serial homicide. 
Conclusions: Technology, shifts in offending behavior, proactive law enforcement action, and vigilance of society have transformed serial killing and aids in viewing offenders as people impacted by societal shifts and cultural norms. The absence of narrative details inhibited some aspects of the review. An exhaustive list of known unresolved serial homicide series remained elusive as some missing persons are never reported.

Many issues surrounding cognitive ability especially those related to heredity is highly charged. Yet, all of the discussion on heredity has been based on non-DNA evidence. It is largely neglected that DNA and environmental data at individual level are indispensable for understanding the development of cognitive ability. In this article, we report findings from a study that uses both ability-related polygenic scores (PGSs) and a rich set of socioeconomic measures from Add Health. In an all-ethnicity sample excluding blacks, a social-science model predicts verbal ability well yielding an R2 of 17.5%. Adding two ability-related PGSs increases this R2 by 1.7%. Such models yield more accurate estimates of the effects of the PGSs and those of SES context, and provide an estimated degree to which SES context is influenced by parental genomes. Schooling and neighborhood remain important to verbal ability even after an early measure of verbal ability is adjusted in the model. Although the influence from the genome is evident, the influences of SES context are critical and cannot be dismissed.",TRUE,FALSE,Add Health|cognitive ability|gene-environment interaction|genomics|polygenic score|verbal ability,2019-02-09T00:09:03.015170,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-09T00:08:30.522244,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology",,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/citation/,gz7er,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5e0e1376653c0018271959/,5c5e0e1376653c0018271959,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gz7er/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gz7er,NA

Racial Disparities in Police Use of Force During Investigatory Stops","Black civilians are more likely to be stopped by police than White civilians net of relevant factors. Less is known about whether or not racial inequalities exist in police use of force during stops. Using data on over two million police stops in New York City from 2007-2014 and drawing on literatures on race, policing, and the Black Lives Matter movement, we test hypotheses regarding the associations between race, civilian behavior, age, and police use of force. We also investigate whether recent reforms reduced any observed inequality in police violence during stops. Findings show that Black and White civilians experience fundamentally different interactions with police. Black civilians are particularly more likely to experience potential lethal force when police uncover criminal activity and this disparity is greatest for Black youth compared to White youth. Overall, if there were no racial disparities in police use of force, we estimate that approximately 61,000 fewer stops of Black civilians would have included police use of force and 1,000 fewer stops would have included potential lethal force from 2007-2014.

Using Fraser’s tripartite framework of justice, we reformulate and expand the existing critiques of the smart city.

Indeed, over the last decades scientific integrity became a hot issue in science policy (Tchao, 2014). Moreover, papers retracted for fraud or other reasons should not be cited or used anymore. Although in most cases they are earmarked as retracted in bibliographic databases and in the electronic version of journals, they often remain cited a long time after the retraction notice is published. The misconduct case of Jan Hendrik Schön is a well know example.

The sample of the study consisted of 132 randomly-selected EFL preparatory year instructors at Al-Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, and King Saud University in Riyadh city. Three instruments were utilized to collect data for the study: the first one was a questionnaire, the second was semi-structured interviews, and the third one was lectures observations. The researcher designed a five-point Likert scale questionnaire to collect the data of the study which was validated by a panel of raters consisting of ten university professors and instructors. To ensure reliability, Cronbach Alpha formula was calculated. Besides, The findings of the study revealed that the causes of Saudi EFL university instructors’ barriers to teaching the speaking skill in the preparatory year were as follows: students’ use of L1 during group work or pair work, lack of vocabulary, fear of making mistakes, lack of self-confidence, and lack of motivation. Furthermore, the study results advocated the following solutions to Saudi EFL university instructors’ barriers to teaching the speaking skill: enhancing students’ self-confidence to speak without fear, correcting students’ mistakes kindly, meeting students’ needs in speaking textbooks, and adopting recent motivating techniques, increasing the motivating speaking activities in textbooks, and testing the speaking skill. Finally, the study concluded that teacher training and preparation programs should help EFL instructors overcome and avoid such teaching barriers in teaching the speaking skills",TRUE,FALSE,accuracy|fluency|motivation|questionnaire|speaking|speaking deficiency|teaching barriers,2019-07-20T21:28:01.306684,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:27:36.612137,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69yeq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69yeq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69yeq/citation/,69yeq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69yeq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69yeq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69yeq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5d03ab76653c001b2ccd47/,5c5d03ab76653c001b2ccd47,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69yeq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69yeq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/69yeq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/69yeq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/69yeq,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.222

It also aims at exploring the most frequently employed translation procedures as well as the effectiveness of using Newmark’s translation procedures in conveying the source text to the target text as naturally and accurately as possible. To achieve these goals, the researcher applies a descriptive content analysis method on 18 religious texts collected from Islamic Guidance with their English translations. The findings of this study indicate that the translator utilized all Newmark’s translation procedures except the translation label. The most frequently used procedure was the descriptive equivalent procedure whereas the least frequently used procedure was the recognized translation procedure. The results also show that the translation procedures are helpful (especially the target-oriented ones) in conveying the meaning of the text from Arabic into English.",TRUE,FALSE,Islamic texts|Newmark’s Model of Translation Procedures|translation procedures,2019-07-20T21:27:20.986772,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20T21:27:08.155178,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ae8w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ae8w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ae8w/citation/,5ae8w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ae8w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ae8w/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ae8w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5d0122e16f5500178ef97d/,5c5d0122e16f5500178ef97d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ae8w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ae8w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ae8w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ae8w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ae8w,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.225
