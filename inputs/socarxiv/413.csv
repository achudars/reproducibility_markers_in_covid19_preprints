Previously thought to be a sparsely occupied environment, archaeologists have recorded hundreds of geometric earthworks between the Purús and Acre rivers in recent years, spurring renewed interest in understanding the distribution, age, and function of these structures. A challenge has been to identify possible relationships between sites and to place them in their broader landscape setting. The precise spatial scale, relative importance of different factors, and strength of any relationships that contributed to shaping their distributions remain an open question. This paper develops and applies an explicitly spatial framework to address this problem, drawing on a rich body of recent research in Acre state (Brazil) and advanced point process modelling. The analytical approach, which is fully documented and reproducible with the accompanying code, infers the factors affecting earthwork distribution at multiple spatial scales. This enables the first robust predictions of territorial integration in the region, which is discussed context of extant archaeological models. The findings support the interpretation that non-stratified societies occupied likely Acre during the late pre-Columbian period.",TRUE,FALSE,Amazonia|earthworks|social complexity|South America|spatial statistics|territoriality,2019-07-25T09:57:26.465219,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T09:56:55.786509,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea5gh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea5gh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea5gh/citation/,ea5gh,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea5gh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ng896/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea5gh/relationships/node/,ng896,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea5gh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3964c373ae42001a3a94ad/,5d3964c373ae42001a3a94ad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea5gh/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea5gh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea5gh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ea5gh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ea5gh,NA

In 2014, the Chinese government proposed to build a social credit system (SCS) to better collect and evaluate citizens’ creditworthiness and grant rewards and punishments based on one’s social credit. Since then, various SCS pilots have been enacted. While current media and scholars often perceive SCS as a single and unified system, this paper argues that there are in fact multiple SCSs in China. I identify four main types of SCS and articulate the relationships among them. Each SCS has different assumptions, operationalizations, and implementations. China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, and the macroeconomic management agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, are the two most important actors in the design and implementation of the multiple SCSs. Yet their distinctive views about what “credit” is and what an SCS should be produced great tensions on the SCS landscape. I also historicize current SCSs and show that many elements and assumptions of SCSs can be traced back to a broader political history of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Finally, I propose an alternative theoretical framework to understand Chinese SCSs as a symbolic system with performative power that is more than a simple repressive and direct political project.",TRUE,FALSE,China|Classification|Governance|Rating System|Social Credit System,2019-07-25T10:12:49.648671,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T10:12:02.111878,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",NA,Chuncheng Liu,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/citation/,v9frs,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/79qn2/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/relationships/node/,79qn2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d38d6db5d2cdc00180773c5/,5d38d6db5d2cdc00180773c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9frs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v9frs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v9frs,NA

The story was variously framed as one more vicious murder of Middle Eastern Christians by militant Islamists, one more index of chaos in post-Qaddafi Libya and one more opportunity for an Arab state, in this case Egypt, to enlist in the latest phase of the war on terror. What was left unaddressed was the deep and long-standing enmeshment of the Libyan and Egyptian economies, embodied in the tens of thousands of Egyptian workers who remain in Libya despite the civil war raging there. There is a history of maltreatment of Egyptian migrants in Libya spanning more than 60 years. The abuses date back to the organized migration of Egyptian teachers, bureaucrats and other professionals under Gamal Abdel Nasser, and have continued with increasing brutality until the present. From the beginning, whether under King Idris, under Muammar al-Qaddafi or following the colonel’s downfall, the causes of the violence have been distinctly political, with Egyptians in Libya always vulnerable to the vicissitudes of Egyptian-Libyan state relations as well as to regional crises.

Associate member groups offered congregations a new way to extend the reach of their respective missions and charisms, while deepening the relationships with lay women and men who partnered with them in ministry.

In this paper, I explore the relatively recent history of associate groups and how these organizations have and continue to work with their sponsoring congregations. I use data from the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA)—commissioned recently by the North American Conference of Associates and Religious (NACAR)—to look at demographic trends among women religious and associates. I describe how religious communities incorporate associates into their organizational decision-making, and how certain internal processes—like general chapters—are now open to associate members.

Overall, I submit that given the declining numbers of sisters and aging populations of many religious communities, associate groups have the potential to provide opportunities to conceptualize new forms of religious life in the Catholic Church. Finally, I argue that associate groups also have the important role of increasing gender, racial, and class diversity among communities of women religious, and that this diversity may lead to a more inclusive and democratizing corporate structure for women’s religious congregations in the 21st century.",TRUE,FALSE,Clergy|Gender|Nuns|Religiosity|Religious Life|Sociology of Religion|Spirituality|Women Religious,2019-07-25T10:03:21.904044,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25T10:03:05.110281,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,NA,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/citation/,we627,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d385f09a667db001afa2f0b/,5d385f09a667db001afa2f0b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/we627/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/we627,NA

This idea was formulated based on the theory of compensating wage differentials (CWDs). A factorial survey is used to empirically examine the willingness to accept lower-paying jobs.

This article relies primarily on newly declassified material from the British Foreign Office archives, unpublished reports from the Egyptian Ministry of Education, and an analysis of related articles in three main Egyptian newspapers (al-Ahram, al-Akhbar, al-Jumhuriya) in order to provide a detailed reconstruction of regional migration’s importance for Egyptian foreign policy. It debunks the conventional wisdom that Egyptian migration became a socio-political issue only in the post-1973 era, arguing that the Nasserite regime developed a governmental policy that allowed, and encouraged, Egyptians’ political activism in Libya, Syria, Yemen, and the Persian Gulf according to state foreign policy priorities in the 1952-1967 period. By presenting a cache of archival material in analytical and critical context, this article offers concrete evidence of how migration buttressed Egypt’s regional ambitions under Gamal Abdel Nasser.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab Cold War|Diasporas|Education politics in the Middle East|Egypt|Egyptian politics|Emigration|Gamal Abdel Nasser|High-Skilled migration|Migration|soft power,2019-07-24T13:19:01.965507,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24T12:25:32.191837,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5f|Education|International and Comparative Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,NA,British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u5gw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u5gw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u5gw/citation/,8u5gw,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u5gw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xgc5e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u5gw/relationships/node/,xgc5e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u5gw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d37f3b3835aff001758caf3/,5d37f3b3835aff001758caf3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u5gw/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u5gw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8u5gw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8u5gw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8u5gw,https://doi.org/10.1080/13530194.2015.1102708

Evidence from Egypt,"Why do states vary their policies towards their citizens abroad, and why are some emigrant groups treated preferentially to others? The literature on the politics of international migration has yet to explore this as a separate field of inquiry, assuming that states adopt a single policy that encourages, sustains or prevents emigration abroad. Yet, in the case of Egypt, the state developed a multi-tiered policy that distinctly favoured specific communities abroad over others. I hypothesise that policy differentiation is based upon the perceived utility of the emigrant group remaining abroad versus the utility of its return. This utility is determined by two factors: the sending state’s domestic political economy priorities and its foreign policy objectives.",TRUE,FALSE,Anwar Sadat|Arab|Egypt|Egyptian authoritarianism|Egyptian diaspora|Egyptian foreign policy|Egyptian migration|Egyptian politics|Egyptians abroad|Hosni Mubarak|labor migration|Mediterranean|Middle East|Migration|Multiple diasporas|Multi-tier|Sending states|Transnational repression,2019-07-24T13:18:05.087836,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24T12:24:58.978768,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,NA,Journal of Ethnic &amp; Migration Studies,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k75gz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k75gz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k75gz/citation/,k75gz,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k75gz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xgc5e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k75gz/relationships/node/,xgc5e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k75gz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d37f1f15d2cdc00170aaa67/,5d37f1f15d2cdc00170aaa67,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k75gz/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k75gz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k75gz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k75gz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k75gz,https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183X.2015.1049940

The securitization of cross-border mobility has been a common theme in examining immigration policies in the Global North. The securitization of emigration and diasporas in non-democratic contexts remains neglected; this is particularly true with regard to Arab states’ extraterritorial authoritarian practices. This article argues that authoritarian states develop a range of migration policies that are driven by the contradictory pressures of economic and political imperatives or, put differently, an illiberal paradox: if a state does not expect economic gains from cross-border mobility, it is more likely to securitize its emigration policy; otherwise, it is more likely to securitize its diaspora policy. The article illustrates this trade-off via a most-similar comparison of Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and Morocco. Drawing on Arabic and non-Arabic primary and secondary sources, it sketches a novel area of research on migration and security.",NA,NA,Algeria|Algerian diaspora|authoritarianism|autocratic politics|diasporas|illiberal paradox|Libya|Libyan diaspora|Mediterranean|MENA|Middle East|migration|Moroccan diaspora|Morocco|North Africa|securitisation|state-diaspora relations|transnational repression|Tunisia|Tunisian diaspora,NA,2019-08-23T13:04:11.943543,,TRUE,withdrawn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,"I had already uploaded the paper on SocArcXiv (https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/265fg/), this duplicate was uploaded in error.",Ethnic &amp; Racial Studies,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7r2c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7r2c/bibliographic_contributors/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7r2c/review_actions/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y7r2c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y7r2c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y7r2c,https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2019.1585558

In an effort to shift the discussion on state-diaspora relations beyond liberal democratic contexts and single-case studies, this article comparatively examines how authoritarian emigration states in the Middle East – Libya, Syria, Egypt, Turkey, and Jordan – behave towards their own citizens living beyond state borders. It identifies how each state develops multi-tier diaspora engagement policies aimed at three separate stages of citizens’ mobility: first, policies of exit regulate aspects related to emigration from the country of origin; second, overseas policies target citizens beyond the territorial boundaries of the nation state; finally, return policies set processes of readmission into the country of origin. In doing so, the article identifies similarities across disparate Middle East states’ engagement with emigration and diaspora policymaking. At the same time, the article paints a more complex picture of non-democracies’ strategies towards cross-border mobility that problematizes existing conceptualizations of authoritarian practices and state-diaspora relations.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab politics|authoritarianism|autocracies|diasporas|Egypt|Jordan|Libya|Middle East|migration|migration diplomacy|state-diaspora relations|Syria|transnational repression|Turkey,2019-07-24T13:15:23.124423,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24T12:23:46.545164,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,NA,Mediterranean Politics,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/citation/,r7e3x,preprints,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xgc5e/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/relationships/node/,xgc5e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d37edb9835aff001857d875/,5d37edb9835aff001857d875,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r7e3x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r7e3x,https://doi.org/10.1080/13629395.2018.1511299
