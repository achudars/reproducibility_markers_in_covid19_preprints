To identify prosperous businesses that create jobs and encourage economic development, this study isolates businesses other than street-vending enterprises with non-family employees. Retrospective life history data from the Mexican Migration Project (N = 11,789 persons &amp; 146,372 person-years) was used to estimate the annual probability of becoming an entrepreneur across 170 Mexican communities between 1975-2017. This study found that (1) any prior migration experience increases the probability of entrepreneurial entry relative to non-migrants; (2) accumulated months of migration experience are positively associated with the probability of entrepreneurial entry; (3) undocumented status is associated with a lower probability of entrepreneurial entry. The positive effect of accumulated migration experience on entrepreneurship suggests that international migrants can accumulate human and financial resources that are essential to early stage entrepreneurship. Thus, entrepreneurship represents an important pathway through which international migration can encourage economic development in less developed regions. At the same time, the results suggest that immigration policies in receiving countries can undercut migrants’ capacities to mobilize resources and contribute to economic development upon return. These findings suggest that target migration creates a win-win by addressing labor shortages in receiving countries, while transferring resources to sending areas that enable economic mobility and development.",TRUE,FALSE,Entrepreneurship|Human capital|Legal status|Mexico|Migration|Population,2020-07-05T17:52:47.238514,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-05T17:52:17.942836,FALSE,NA,no,This data can be accessed through the MMP project website: https://opr.princeton.edu/archive/mmp/.

However, defining the ‘self’ and the ‘other’ in a complex ethno-linguistic milieu such as South Asia has traditionally not been very easy. Earlier research by Romila Thapar (1971) and Aloka Parasher-Sen (1978) have demonstrated how a variety of ancient texts have used the category of mleccha in Sanskrit or malikkha in Pali to refer to the ‘other’ as recognized vis-a-vis the ‘Hindu’ self. However, not only do Thapar and Parasher-Sen both highlight the inconsistencies in the use of the term, they also fail at locating a precise theory of ‘othering’ employed in ancient India. This paper, uses a variety of Sanskrit sources in formulating a ‘theory of othering’ that can be effectively demonstrated to have been operative as evident from the Mahabharata and in Mauryan India. Finally, it also offers insights into the nature of inclusion operative in this paradigm of othering and explains this using the case study of Bhima’s marriage to Hidimba in the Mahabharata.",TRUE,FALSE,Aryan|Mahabharata|Manava|Maurya|Mleccha|Tribes,2020-07-06T16:06:02.062488,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-06T16:05:25.807097,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccf|Arts and Humanities|History|Asian History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cdc|Arts and Humanities|History|Cultural History,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64fhj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64fhj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64fhj/citation/,64fhj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64fhj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ne6d7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64fhj/relationships/node/,ne6d7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64fhj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f00811aea59af0175d3af99/,5f00811aea59af0175d3af99,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64fhj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64fhj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/64fhj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/64fhj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/64fhj

This paper studies the relationship between the pre-colonial Mughal State and its tribes and juxtaposes it against the colonial state’s management of the Khonds and the Santals, and explores what can be known about the nature of the nineteenth century ‘Indian’ state that is fundamentally different from its earlier avatars. Employing police reports and legal court files, this paper concludes, that the uniqueness of the colonial State lay in its unilateral interactions with the tribes that is a product of the transition from a state that exercised ‘narrative sovereignty’ over its territories to one that aspired to enforce ‘actual sovereignty.’ This categorical change in the nature of the state, this paper argues, employing Marshall Sahlins’ ‘possible theory of history,’ caused structural changes in the tribe-state relationship—the breakdown of which then became irreconcilable and the tribes reacted by performing rituals such as the meriah and the bitlaha which now assumed political functions.

We assess whether the association between Christian nationalism and Trump support differed for churchgoers and non-churchgoers and find that Christian nationalism is not significantly associated with Trump support among churchgoing voters. Instead, Christian nationalism is only significantly associated with Trump support among unchurched voters. These results suggest that while religious ideology remains a key driver of political attitudes and behavior in the U.S., its effects may have less to do with embeddedness in traditional religious organizations and more to do with the ways people use religious narratives in everyday life to construct and defend symbolic boundaries.

This study uses mathematical models associated with the efficiency of biological enzyme clustering in order to assess the degree to which EDPs are at risk of loss of culture and determine the potential impact of proposed policies.

There were critical objectives of this study, firstly, to predict the number of people at risk of losing their homeland at a particular time in the future. Second, based on the aforementioned projections, find ethical and beneficial policies to move these Environmentally Displaced Persons (EDPs) in a way such that EDPs can honorably preserve their unique cultural heritage. We took into account that these small island nations have small populations and individual cultural differences exist within each different island.

A Sea Level Rise-Based Climate Impact Migration Model was proposed to find the number of people affected by the land lost from the Sea Level Rise (SLR). In the direction of accurate projections, our team designed two simulations that were executed on the SLR Model. Fundamentally, an Exponential Regression Model was used to calculate the future total population of Maldives (one of the at-risk-nations in danger of flooding) presuming the population followed the exponential growth. Next, we used a Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm to find the non-linear model for the flooded area of the land and Water Drop Waveform Model to also calculate the flooded area on the island. We predict about 13% of people lose their homes by 2050, 72% by 2080, and 93% by 2100.

Next, a Two-Step Metabolic Pathway Model was adopted to explain social heritage preservation within a confined area based on the idea that two-step metabolism and cultural transition work in a complementary fashion. It is known that communication between EDPs and individuals of the host country must go through an intermediate to communicate, this analogous phenomenon is seen in the one-way communication between an enzyme and its substrate to catalyze the formation of a product. In our mathematical model, the product is the cultural preservation and the enzyme-substrate complex is mathematically seen by the interaction between the EDPs and individuals of the host country.

Racial dot map is a method of visualizing racial geography which depicts spatial distribution, population density, and racial mix in a single, easy-to-understand map. Because of the richness of information it carries, the dot map is an excellent tool for visual analysis of racial distribution. Presently used racial dot maps are based on the census data at the tract or the block level. In this paper, we present a method of constructing a more spatially accurate racial dot map based on a sub-block resolution population grid. The utility of our dot maps is further enhanced by placing dots on the map in random order regardless of the race they represent in order to achieve a more accurate depiction of local racial composition. We present a series of comparisons between dot maps based on tract, block, and grid data. The advantage of a grid-based dot map is evident from the visual comparison of all maps with an actual image of the mapped area. We make available the R code for constructing grid-based dot maps. We also make available 2010 grid-based racial dot maps for all counties in the conterminous United States.",TRUE,FALSE,Census areal units|gridded population data|racial diversity|Racial dot maps|racial segregation,2020-07-06T16:01:05.358119,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-06T16:00:26.449589,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62mk3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62mk3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62mk3/citation/,62mk3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62mk3/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62mk3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62mk3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eff65b7ea59af015bd331ff/,5eff65b7ea59af015bd331ff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62mk3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62mk3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/62mk3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/62mk3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/62mk3

Most currently used approaches to this problem center around the calculation of segregation metrics; as such, they pertain to only a single pattern’s feature and they lack a compelling visualization component. In this paper, we propose a reimagined approach to spatio-racial analysis based on the concept of landscape and landscape analysis. This approach unites quantification and visualization components of the analysis. It also quantifies the entire racial topography, not just segregation. Key novel concepts are the racial landscape (RL) and the exposure matrix. RL is a high-resolution grid in which each cell contains only inhabitants of a single race. The exposure matrix tabulates adjacencies between neighboring cells weighted by the local density of adjacent subpopulations; it provides a concise quantification of the RL pattern. Two information-theoretical metrics, derived from the exposure matrix, quantify diversity, and segregation of the RL. Segregation is quantified from cell adjacencies without the need for subdivision of the region of interest. Thus, the entire region, as well as its arbitrary subregions, are RLs quantified by their diversities and segregations. Coloring cells in RL according to combinations of their race and local densities provides a natural visualization of racial topography which serves as an “observation” that provides check on numerical metrics. The RL method is described and its application is demonstrated on Cook County, IL. An implementation of the RL method in R package accompanies this paper.",TRUE,FALSE,diversity|information theory|landscape|pattern analysis|Residential segregation,2020-07-06T16:01:52.711156,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-06T16:01:25.946913,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mejz5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mejz5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mejz5/citation/,mejz5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mejz5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9w2jd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mejz5/relationships/node/,9w2jd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mejz5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eff5f99bee6650150f99afb/,5eff5f99bee6650150f99afb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mejz5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mejz5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mejz5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mejz5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mejz5

A booklet of relevant tests was distributed to university students who served as participants. It was found that field independent participants scored higher on rational thinking tasks than field-dependent participants did. Sensitivity-to-framing was also found to be a better predictor of rational thinking than was analytical intelligence.
