More specically, this measure relies on Word Mover's Distance, which uses word embeddings to determine similarities between two documents.  In our approach, which we call Concept Mover's Distance, a document is measured by the minimum distance the words in the document need to travel to arrive at the position of a ""pseudo document"" consisting of only words denoting a focal concept.  This approach captures the prototypical structure of concepts,  is fairly robust to pruning sparse terms as well as variation in text lengths within a corpus, and when used with pre-trained embeddings, can be used even when terms denoting concepts are absent from corpora and can be applied to bag-of-words datasets.

They make reference to an array of potentially harmful exposures occurring from birth to eighteen years of age and may be involved in the construction of health inequalities over the lifecourse. As with many simplified concepts, ACEs present limitations. They include diverse types of exposures, are often considered cumulatively, can be identified using prospective and retrospective approaches, and their multidimensional nature may lead to greater measurement error. From a public health perspective, ACEs are useful for describing the need to act upon complex social environments to prevent health inequalities at a population level. As the ACEs concept becomes popular in the context of policy interventions, concerns have emerged. As a probabilistic and population-level tool, it is not adapted to diagnose individual-level vulnerabilities, an approach which could ultimately exacerbate inequalities.

It applies hybrid mixed effects regression models that partition between- and within-person variation to estimate parental savings and financial assets over time and across different households. The results suggest that coresidence with adult children led to decreases in parental assets and savings. In the years in which their children lived at home, parents held 24% less in financial assets and 23% less in savings compared to years when adult children were not present.

Religion scholars have argued that religion is multi-faceted and hence better understood by focusing on combinations of indicators (i.e. mosaics), versus a more traditional variable-centered approach. We adopt this framework and investigate the interplay between religion and peer networks, both in how religious mosaics are shaped by friends and how profiles affect friend selection dynamics. With data from two schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate these religious mosaics using latent class analysis (LCA) to identify profiles consisting of combinations of commonly available survey-based measures of religious attitudes, behaviors and identities. Finding evidence of theoretically-expected profiles, our second step is to use stochastic actor based models (SABMs) to investigate network dynamics for these LCA-based religious profiles. We demonstrate how the distinct structure of profile data can be integrated within the SABM framework to evaluate processes of friend selection and influence.

examines how grassroots women lead interventions and the resulting effects on leadersâ€™ and
survivorsâ€™ lives. Findings suggest that although most survivors had displayed some agency in
independently resisting violence, their efforts are effective when coupled with a support network
and access to resources. With the intervention of leaders, the survivors were able to better
negotiate for justice with a renewed sense of agency. For the leaders, participation in programs
gave them an identity independent from their status within the family. They promoted change by

Although survey-linked mortality files play a prominent role in U.S. health disparities research, it is unclear how well mortality estimates from these datasets align with one another and whether they are comparable with U.S. vital statistics data. We conduct the first study that systematically compares mortality estimates from several widely-used survey-linked mortality files and U.S. vital statistics data. Our results show that mortality rates and life expectancies from the National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality Files, Health and Retirement Study, Americansâ€™ Changing Lives study, and U.S. vital statistics data are similar. Mortality rates are slightly lower and life expectancies are slightly higher in these linked datasets relative to vital statistics data. Compared with vital statistics and other survey-linked datasets, General Social Survey-National Death Index life expectancy estimates are much lower at younger adult ages and much higher at older adult ages. Cox proportional hazard models regressing all-cause mortality risk on age, gender, race, educational attainment, and marital status conceal the issues with the General Social Survey-National Death Index that are observed in our comparison of absolute measures of mortality risk.

Through combining ceramic vessels and arrow point assemblages, it is further assumed that the cultural resolution of the aggregated network will be greater than that of an independent ceramic or lithic network.
