The relationship between this process and children’s rights is, however, rarely acknowledged. The political, social and legal legitimacy of these harmonisation efforts have come under strict scrutiny, but hardly ever from the point of view of children. This article explores the impact of the process of legal harmonisation on children’s rights, and uses the issue of children’s tort liability as a case-study. The legal solutions in this field are analysed and compared, and the academic proposals for harmonisation are assessed. This choice of subject and approach allows us to assess the advisability of further harmonisation, illustrate the importance of socio-economic factors in this process, and highlight the relevance of children’s rights and fundamental rights to this debate.",TRUE,FALSE,children’s torts|European Union|fundamental rights|harmonisation|mainstreaming|private law,2018-10-14T20:43:20.981172,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-14T20:43:00.970759,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c61|Law|Torts|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira,2011,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7zfd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7zfd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7zfd/citation/,u7zfd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7zfd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gz25j/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7zfd/relationships/node/,gz25j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7zfd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc395a12aa873001ec489e9/,5bc395a12aa873001ec489e9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7zfd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7zfd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7zfd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u7zfd/,https://doi.org/10.1163/157181811X587359,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u7zfd

Spain has been a member of the EU for more than 25 years, however, the assessment of the implementation by Spanish authorities of EU law in this field has remained mostly limited to fairly descriptive analyses of the applicable statutory framework. This article goes beyond that and looks critically into the evolution of this statutory framework and, above all, its judicial application. Besides analysing the Spanish legal framework applicable to the free movement of EU citizens and their family members, this article explores a range of obstacles to that free movement. It concentrates particularly on the most striking obstacle to free movement - exclusion orders - by exploring in detail the rules and case law (mainly produced by the Spanish Supreme Court) that have dealt with the possibility of expulsion of EU citizens and their family members.",TRUE,FALSE,derogations to free movement|European citizenship|European Law|European Union|free movement|Spain|Spanish Supreme Court,2018-10-14T19:16:22.592390,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-14T19:16:07.323712,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0f|Law|Public Law and Legal Theory|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c33|Law|Labor and Employment Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira,2013,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez8k4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez8k4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez8k4/citation/,ez8k4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez8k4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/s4cu8/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez8k4/relationships/node/,s4cu8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez8k4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc38ba92aa873001cc45756/,5bc38ba92aa873001cc45756,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez8k4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez8k4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ez8k4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ez8k4/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ez8k4

These case studies were prepared in support of the Data Management and Use: Governance in the 21st Century project, carried out by the British Academy and the Royal Society. The purpose of these case studies was to stimulate thinking and discussion by the working group, in their deliberations on governance needs for data management and use across all sectors. This publication is an edited version of the case studies presented to the working group.

The case studies aim to give concrete examples of the kinds of social and ethical tensions that arise in contemporary data use and management – and they draw on the sets of social and ethical pairings, detailed in the main report of this project, that were identified at a cross- disciplinary expert workshop held in July 2016. 

They give current and forward-looking examples of the benefits and challenges of data collection, management and use across a range of sectors and the governance needs in different contexts.
Intended as they are solely to inform the working group, these case studies are not presented as the views of either Academy, and are not intended as appraisals or evaluations of any of the governance approaches identified in them..

We find that the size of the indigenous population varies dramatically depending on the measure of indigeneity used, and that using multiple measures captures distinct modes of indigeneity. Using latent class analysis, we find that contemporary indigenous classification clusters around four types, which we characterize as Traditional Indians, Indigenous Mestizos, New Indians, and Non-Indigenous. Traditional Indians tend to be indigenous on virtually all indicators, and they are especially poor, dark, and rural. Indigenous Mestizos tend to speak an indigenous language, but self-identification as indigenous is tenuous. New Indians assert an indigenous identity despite their frequent lack of linguistic knowledge and close indigenous ancestry, and
they are as urban, educated, and light-skinned as the Non-Indigenous. The analysis addresses sociological concepts of ethnic boundaries, assimilation, mestizaje, and symbolic
ethnicity and discusses the implications of distinct modes of indigenous ethnicity.",TRUE,FALSE,Identity|Indigenous|Latin America|Race and Ethnicity,2018-10-14T14:32:21.220075,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-14T14:32:12.301446,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/citation/,pka2y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/cm2dz/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/relationships/node/,cm2dz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc34d82512c030019902e92/,5bc34d82512c030019902e92,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pka2y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pka2y/,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soy091,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pka2y

Although Directive 2004/28 (the Citizenship Directive) has enhanced the system of protection afforded to offending European Union citizens, it still contains a number of cracks that lead to policy incoherence and gaps in rights protection. This is evident in the first rulings on Article 28(3) of Directive 2004/38 concerning the deportation of offending EU citizens. These issues also threaten to transform European Union citizenship from a fundamental status into a thin overlay that, under pressure from national executive power, loses its effect and significance. To be sure, EU citizenship has demonstrated that community belonging does not have to be based on organic-national qualities, cultural commonalities, or individuals' conformity to national values, but the continued deportation of long-term resident Union citizens makes nationality the ultimate determinant of belonging.

Yet, very little attention has so far been directed towards Portuguese refugee law. This may be due to the relatively low number of asylum seekers that Portugal receives, but that does not justify neglecting the study of the Portuguese socio-legal framework applicable to asylum seekers and refugees. This short piece summarises the findings of an article that addresses this gap by analyzing the framework in a European context, enhancing the analysis with a case study of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, and intersex (LGBTI) asylum seekers. The analysis explores the evolution of the current legal framework, the procedures and remedies available to asylum seekers, the substantive standards applied in decision-making, and the broader socio-legal resources offered to asylum seekers.

This article looks into the European Union (EU) legal framework that applies to children who work, and offers a socio-legal analysis of child work regulation more generally. In so doing, it considers the role of a range of factors relevant to the regulation of child work, including children’s rights, cultural relativism, social constructions of childhood, empirical evidence of the benefits and harm of child work, and the different contexts in which children are found working. The article advances a justification for a restrictive approach in relation to child work in the European context, on the basis of legal, social, economic and cultural factors.",TRUE,FALSE,childhood|child labour|children’s rights|child work|cultural relativism|European Union|labour law|Young Workers Directive,2018-10-14T14:47:21.557121,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-14T14:46:59.129702,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c33|Law|Labor and Employment Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c53|Law|International Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c57|Law|Other Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,Nuno Ferreira,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ude5j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ude5j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ude5j/citation/,ude5j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ude5j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8k6z4/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ude5j/relationships/node/,8k6z4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ude5j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bc33382512c03001790b354/,5bc33382512c03001790b354,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ude5j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ude5j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ude5j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ude5j/,https://doi.org/10.1163/22134514-00401002,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ude5j
