This paper investigates how the socio-economic background of learners affects their own experience and their chances of course completion. The analyses test whether learners from low socio-economic status (SES) have lower chances of completing the online course and whether participation in online discussion forums mediates the role of SES. Analyzing data from two MOOCs provided by Stanford University, we find that in both cases a negative association between low SES, course completion and course engagement is observed. Moreover, we find that forum participation has an ambiguous role, reinforcing the advantage of well-educated learners enrolled in one course, while does not have any significant effect for the other course.

We propose that neural word embeddings provide a parsimonious and cognitively plausible model of the representations learned from natural language. Using neural word embeddings, we extract cultural schemata about body weight from New York Times articles. We identify several cultural schemata that link obesity to gender, immorality, poor health, and low socioeconomic class. Such schemata may be subtly but pervasively activated in public culture; thus, language can chronically reproduce biases.

Here we conduct a global empirical test of long-standing theories from ecology, economics, and anthropology regarding potential drivers of land ownership and territoriality. Prior theory suggests that resource defensibility, subsistence strategies, population pressure, political complexity, and cultural transmission mechanisms may all influence land ownership. We applied multi-model inference procedures based on logistic regression to cultural and environmental data from 102 societies, 71 with some form of land ownership and 31 with no land ownership. We found an increased probability of land ownership in mountainous environments, where patchy resources may be more cost effective to defend via ownership. We also uncovered support for the role of population pressure, with a greater probability of land ownership in societies living at higher population densities. Our results also show more land ownership when neighboring societies also practiced ownership.

In breaking structural boundaries, consequently, the grotesque appears as deformations, aberrations, exaggerations, metamorphosis, or startling portmanteaus. Given both its nightmarish texture and the evil ingenuity of Dr. Lecter’s murders, Hannibal (NBC, 2013-15) ploughs fertile ground in putting together conceptually distant and even contradictory elements. Hence, this article explores how the aesthetic and philosophical principles of the grotesque are a pervasive presence throughout the entire Hannibal TV series, defining its style, characters’ personality and metaphorical themes. Putting art theory in dialogue with the Hannibal televised text, this article demonstrates how the grotesque – one of the key concepts in Gothic horror – permeates every level of the show, from the opening credits to the protagonist’s inner transformation, converting the narrative into a comprehensive and cohesive liminal artistic ecosystem.",TRUE,FALSE,Aesthetics|Gothic Horror|Grotesque|Hannibal|Television Studies|TV Series,2020-03-24T18:29:07.343828,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-24T18:28:38.164626,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c90|Arts and Humanities|Television|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d24|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Visual Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d26|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Other Film and Media Studies,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/citation/,rg9de,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qpydc/,qpydc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e785c204a60a50693bb1a45/,5e785c204a60a50693bb1a45,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rg9de/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rg9de/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rg9de,https://doi.org/10.1386/host_00012_1

Both samples—one from the mid-series episode “Stingers” (3.10.), and the other from the series finale, “START” (6.10.)—show how the protagonists, two KGB spies living undercover in the United States as a married couple with two kids, disclose their secret identity to characters with whom they have a special emotional bond: their daughter, who has become a devout Christian; and their best friend and neighbor, who happens to be a counterintelligence officer in the FBI. After exploring how identity and performance play a crucial role in the spy-thriller genre, the article investigates whether it is possible for the audience to interpret the feelings and thoughts of characters with multiple identities who excel in the art of duplicity; and whether the viewer can infer intention from performance.

Recent genetic studies indicate that this was possible because the yeasts used in farmhouse brewing, although domesticated, were different from those used in modern brewing.

In this paper, I study the impact of a rapid and large-scale trade shock: The quartz crisis, which devastated the globally dominant Swiss watch industry in the 1970s. I document the geographic agglomeration pattern of the industry and the impact of the crisis on exports, employment, and wages. Using a differences-in-differences strategy, I show that this trade shock led to a large and rapid loss of population in affected areas, and a long-run change in growth patterns. I explore the mechanisms behind this population change, including the role of manufacturing employment and immigration. I discuss the implications of these results for theories of urban growth, and contrast them with recent work on the China shock in Europe and the United States.",TRUE,FALSE,export competition|growth|quartz crisis|Switzerland|trade,2020-03-22T16:14:25.037477,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-22T16:14:03.672805,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,Tate Twinam,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/citation/,twscm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e765ac44a60a5060abb3a3f/,5e765ac44a60a5060abb3a3f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/twscm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/twscm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/twscm,NA

This paper uses data on adolescents between 15 and 17 years old from 25 European countries to test, if and how the substance-use pattern has changed during the Great Recession.  The data come from two cross-sectional waves (2007 and 2011) of the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) (n= 137,989 individuals).  One percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with an increase [decrease] in the probability of having tried inhalants and cocaine [ecstasy] at least once, by about 0.005 (95% CI: 0.004, 0.006) and 0.001 (95% CI: 0.0001, 0.001) [-0.001 (95% CI: -0.001, -0.001)]  respectively.  Social protection expenditure reduces the use of inhalants, whereas ecstasy consumption rises.

Many nail salon workers are at risk for HBV as they are coming from high-risk and traditionally underserved communities. To understand barriers and knowledge associated with HBV in the Vietnamese nail salon community, the Health Belief Model (HBM) was used to qualitatively assess the health needs for the prevention of HBV among Vietnamese nail salon workers through focus groups and interviews. Results revealed several themes that highlight barriers within the Vietnamese nail community. Major themes were the lack of knowledge related to hepatitis B, including significant misconceptions related to symptoms, and how hepatitis B is transmitted and prevented. There were also several barriers to health care access within the Vietnamese nail community including the cost of health care, long work hours, lack of insurance and lack of understanding of current community resources.  Additionally, discrimination and stigma related to those infected with hepatitis B emerged as a theme from this data. Those interviewed also noted that the nail training and licensing they received did not highlight hepatitis B and other infectious diseases that can be spread within the nail salon.",TRUE,FALSE,AAPI|Health Disparities|Hepatitis B|Nail Salon|Population Health|Qualitative Research|Vietnamese,2020-03-22T16:11:24.567429,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-03-22T16:10:55.122613,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,None,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zd42f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zd42f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zd42f/citation/,zd42f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zd42f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zd42f/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5gf3p/,5gf3p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zd42f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e75a32e4a60a505a8bb6526/,5e75a32e4a60a505a8bb6526,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zd42f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zd42f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zd42f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zd42f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zd42f,NA
