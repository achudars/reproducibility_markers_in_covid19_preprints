Evidence from Aggregate Trends in Euroscepticism,"Fetzer (2018) presents evidence from analyses of panel data at the constituency and individual levels, which suggest that austerity measures implemented by the Conservative-led Coalition government may have caused an increase in the Leave vote share by up to 9.5 percentage points. If Fetzer’s hypothesis were correct, one would expect aggregate Euroscepticism to increase after 2010, during the period of austerity. However, analyses of three separate polling series suggest the opposite, namely that aggregate Euroscepticism declined between 2010 and 2015.

An Experimental Study on the Mismatches between Self-Reported and Physiological Measures in a Simulated Cyberattack Environment,"Fear of crime has been one of the most compelling scientific phenomena since the 60s. Its scope has traditionally been limited to assess this emotional experience predominantly in physical space. However, studies on fear of crime experiences are gradually increasing in this new area of criminal opportunity, which is cyberspace. The aim of this paper is to analyze, in real time, the fear of crime dynamics elicited from a simulation of cyber-attack by malware infection. To meet this aim, our design and results will be explained from a study carried out with the participation of a sample of university students from the Universidad Miguel Hernández de Elche (Spain) in 2018.

In contrast to previous studies, the model relies on the probability distribution of a default jump rather than the default jump itself, as the default jump is usually inaccessible. As such, the model can back out the market prices of convertible bonds. A prevailing belief in the market is that convertible arbitrage is mainly due to convertible underpricing. Empirically, however, we do not find evidence supporting the underpricing hypothesis. Instead, we find that convertibles have relatively large positive gammas. As a typical convertible arbitrage strategy employs delta-neutral hedging, a large positive gamma can make the portfolio highly profitable, especially for a large movement in the underlying stock price.",TRUE,FALSE,convertible arbitrage|convertible bond|convertible underpricing|default probability approach|default time approach|hybrid financial instrument|jump diffusion,2019-10-01T02:47:25.746407,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-30T20:13:17.003943,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/citation/,gxwaj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d911522d55120001b5c6d28/,5d911522d55120001b5c6d28,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gxwaj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gxwaj,NA

Previous studies report conflicting evidence: some find that gender-diverse firms experience more positive performance and others find the opposite. However, most research to date has focused on a single country or industry and has not accounted for possible variation across social contexts. This paper advances an institutional framework and predicts that gender diversity’s relationship with performance depends on both its normative and regulatory acceptance in the broader institutional environment. Using a unique longitudinal sample of 1,069 leading public firms around the world, I find that the relationship between gender diversity and firm performance varies significantly across countries and industries due to differences in institutional context. The more gender diversity has been normatively accepted in a country or industry, the more gender-diverse firms experience positive market valuation and increased revenue. These findings underscore the importance of the broader social context when considering the relationship between gender diversity and firm performance.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-09-29T21:35:02.232097,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-29T20:30:25.158299,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Letian Zhang,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/citation/,8792m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d90d1a5c43280001dc8585f/,5d90d1a5c43280001dc8585f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8792m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8792m,NA

Early selfies were often taken with webcams hooked up to desktop computers and are more stationary in character. They are taken within the home, within the intimacy of the living room or bedroom, and mostly focus exclusively on the photographer’s face. But the prevalence of camera- and internet-enabled smartphones has brought the selfie into the outside world. A selfie today is as much about the photographer’s surroundings as it is about the photographer themselves. Considering how selfies are intricately linked with various social media platforms, the selfie cannot be considered to be just a visual object or cultural representation. Instead, of just being a cultural product, the selfie is intricately tied up in producing social media culture . Selfies are viewed, ‘liked’, commented on and shared onwards by followers and friends on social media platforms as well as by more traditional media. Since smartphones have enabled the selfie to untether itself from the living room webcam, naturally the geography of the selfie and how it produces representations of places becomes an important and intriguing subject. This amplified further by the fact that many selfies are explicitly geotagged. That is, users of social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter choose to add a specific geographic location to the selfie they are uploading. With this implicit indication that the location of that photo is somehow important, we ask ‘what is the geography of the selfie?’.

To answer these questions, this article uses a global dataset of geotagged selfies posted to Twitter since the summer of 2012 (cf. Poorthuis et al., 2016). By matching based on keywords and hashtags related to selfies, a dataset of ~10 million tweets and their corresponding images is extracted. The empirical section on the article consists of two parts. In the first part, characteristics of these selfies are compared with random samples that represent all tweets and all tweets with images attached, respectively. These datasets are mapped and visualized to analyze the geographic distribution of selfie production.",TRUE,FALSE,selfie|Twitter,2019-09-29T21:28:23.129009,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-29T20:29:04.150693,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/citation/,uw954,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d90be81c43280001cc64633/,5d90be81c43280001cc64633,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uw954/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uw954,NA

Drawing on data on appointment procedures in German academia and booking processes in North American stand-up comedy, we compare how gatekeepers in two widely different contexts evaluate and select candidates for established positions in their respective field and validate their decisions. Focusing on three types of gatekeeping practices that have been documented in prior research—typecasting, comparison, and legitimization—our analysis reveals major differences in how gatekeepers perform these practices across our two cases: (1) typecasting based on ascriptive categories vs. professional criteria, (2) comparisons that are ad-hoc and holistic vs. systematic and guided by performance criteria, and (3) legitimation by means of ritualization vs. transparency. We argue that these differences are related to the social and organizational context in which gatekeepers make selection decisions, including differences in the structure of academic and creative careers and the organization of the respective labor markets in which these careers unfold.

While originating in the 1930s, CPT is a theoretical monument of 1960s spatial science. CPT aims to understand settlement geographies based on consumption behavior and is often presented as a singular, outdated, and rationalist theory. After critically reviewing the history of CPT, we assess the microfoundations of Christaller’s CPT – the threshold and range of goods – for various central functions in Louisville, Kentucky. The microfoundations are estimated through data from social media platforms Foursquare and Twitter. These sources alleviate many of the operationalization issues that traditionally hamper empirical use of CPT. The empirical application of CPT reveals that: (i) central functions have typical ranges and thresholds relating central places to population spread; (ii) central functions cluster based on an approximate hierarchical structure. The findings indicate the ongoing importance of CPT in shaping urban-economic geographies.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|Central Place Theory|Foursquare|Louisville KY|Twitter,2019-09-29T20:44:02.419357,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-29T20:18:32.230930,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk39v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk39v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk39v/citation/,bk39v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk39v/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk39v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk39v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d90b5f9d55120001a5c458c/,5d90b5f9d55120001a5c458c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk39v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk39v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bk39v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bk39v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bk39v,https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1298017

The Potential of Big Data, Regionalization, and Community Detection for Understanding the Heterogeneous Nature of Urban Neighborhoods.","How to draw neighborhood boundaries, or spatial regions in general, has been a long‐standing focus in Geography. This article examines this question from a methodological perspective, often referred to as regionalization, with an empirical study of neighborhoods in New York City. I argue that methodological advances, combined with the affordances of big data, enable a different, more nuanced approach to regionalization than has been possible in the past. Conventional data sets often dictate constraints in terms of data availability and spatio‐temporal granularity. However, big data is now available at much finer spatio‐temporal scales and covers a wider array of aspects of social life. The emergence of these data sets supports the notion that neighborhoods can be fuzzy and highly dependent on spatio‐temporal scales and socio‐economic variables. As such, these new data sets can help to bring quantitative analysis in line with social theory that has long emphasized the heterogeneous nature of neighborhoods. This article uses a data set of geotagged tweets to demonstrate how different “sets” of neighborhoods may exist at different spatio‐temporal scales and for different algorithms. Such varying neighborhood boundaries are not a technical problem in need of a solution but rather a reflection of the complexity of the underlying urban fabric.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|community detection|neighborhoods|regionalization|urban geography,2019-09-29T20:41:00.927826,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-29T20:14:56.376626,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wncz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wncz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wncz/citation/,5wncz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wncz/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wncz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wncz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d908176c43280001dc80b78/,5d908176c43280001dc80b78,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wncz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wncz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5wncz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5wncz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5wncz,https://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12143
