Using data from the Canadian Survey Perspective Survey Series 6 (CPSS6) conducted by Statistics Canada, the purpose of this study is to explore these linkages during the second year of the pandemic in Canada. Five levels of social isolation were examined in conjunction with 17 other socio-demographic and psychosocial characteristics of 3,941 respondents to the survey. The study suggests that about three out of four Canadians (75%) have experienced some feeling of social isolation at some point during the pandemic. The most severe form comprised 11% of the total population. In the context of a generalized cross-tabular data analysis, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) detected two major dimensions underlying the data: mental health distress and time duration. These dimensions represented approximately 61% of the inertia or unexplained variation in the data. An examination of the combinations of variable categories revealed that the highest perceived isolation levels were found among young individuals, females, individuals who were single, those who received medical help during the pandemic, and those living in low-rise apartments in urban areas. The lowest levels of perceived social isolation were found among older individuals, rural residents, those who were married and/or reported excellent mental health. Not all individuals who experienced higher levels of mental distress, however, felt social isolation. The findings of the study could be useful when designing public health campaigns aimed at reducing social isolation by providing helpful alternatives to affected populations.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|Feelings|Pandemic|Social Isolationj,2021-07-08T04:46:22.177770,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-08T04:46:01.055386,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ecfh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ecfh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ecfh/citation/,5ecfh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ecfh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ecfh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ecfh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e46c57ef8b3f0435bdd371/,60e46c57ef8b3f0435bdd371,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ecfh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ecfh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ecfh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ecfh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ecfh,NA

However, empirical evidence has been limited. This study uses novel survey data to investigate the occurrence of family violence during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States. Methods: Data come from the second wave of the Assessing the Social Consequences of Covid-19 study, an online non-probability sample collected in March and April 2020. Family violence is measured using four variables: any violence, physical violence, verbal abuse, and restricted access. The authors use logistic regression to examine the prevalence of family violence during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: We find that sexual minorities, in particular bisexual people, experienced higher rates of family violence compared to heterosexual respondents. Women were the only group to report an increase in the frequency of family violence. Household income loss is associated with the incidence of verbal violence. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the importance of expanding victim services to address the additional barriers victims face within the pandemic context and beyond, including broad contexts of social isolation and financial precarity experienced by individuals at risk of family violence.",TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|family strain|family violence|gender|sexuality,2021-07-06T14:31:28.638490,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-06T14:30:58.782012,FALSE,NA,no,"Data will be made public in the future, but currently is not.",,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ghcsv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ghcsv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ghcsv/citation/,ghcsv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ghcsv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ghcsv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ghcsv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e464c6ef8b3f0435bdb887/,60e464c6ef8b3f0435bdb887,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ghcsv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ghcsv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ghcsv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ghcsv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ghcsv,NA

While much effort has been spent developing the technical aspects of these assessments, less attention has been given to research concerning their potential for influencing real-world urban governance processes. To address this issue, we put forward an assessment approach that systematically embeds the assessed indicators within their social and institutional contexts, thereby aiming to enhance the relevance of the assessment for local governance. Specifically, the contextual embedding is achieved through the analysis of ongoing controversies related to the assessed problem. We apply the approach to an assessment of the City of Geneva’s (Switzerland) housing system. As the case study demonstrates, the proposed assessment approach can elucidate a richer picture of the challenges identified in the assessment than a typical quantitative-only analysis of indicators. Therefore, it offers more complete support to local governance stakeholders for learning about and acting upon the problem under assessment. Overall, the work reported in this article aims to contribute to a productive alliance between sustainability assessment methodologies and urban governance stakeholders, thereby leading to more informed steering of cities towards sustainability.",TRUE,FALSE,housing|indicators|institutions|sustainability assessment|urban governance,2021-07-06T08:32:23.027547,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-06T08:31:58.659590,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4vz7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4vz7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4vz7/citation/,m4vz7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4vz7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4vz7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yp3bs/,yp3bs,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4vz7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e35d15ef8b3f03dabda458/,60e35d15ef8b3f03dabda458,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4vz7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4vz7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m4vz7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m4vz7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m4vz7,NA

Consequently, we highlight racial/ethnic identities, racial attitudes, and political identities as predictors of these public opinions. Data for our analyses come from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults who were surveyed just prior to the 2016 presidential election. Descriptive results suggest that well over half of U.S. adults opposed having the NCAA pay college athletes; also, about two-thirds of adults viewed athlete protests during the national anthem as unacceptable. Regression results reveal that Black and Latinx adults were more supportive of paying college athletes and athlete protests during the national anthem than White adults. Other people of color were also more likely than White adults to support paying college athletes. Racial attitudes such as a lack of recognition of racial/ethnic inequalities in education and support for Black Lives Matter also shaped public opinions about these issues in expected ways. Finally, we find that political identities were linked to public opinions about these issues even after accounting for racial/ethnic identities and racial attitudes. Overall, this study documents public opinions about these prominent sports-related issues just prior to the 2016 election of a President who particularly racialized and politicized sports issues. Even then, these sports-related issues had been similarly filtered through both a White racial frame that encourages colorblind racism and a counter frame that promotes antiracist activism. Altogether, the present study offers further evidence of how sports provide cultural terrain for individuals to enact and negotiate racialized and politicized views of sports and society and illustrates how these processes were reflected in public opinions in 2016.",TRUE,FALSE,College sport|Professional sport|Protest|Public opinion|Race/ethnicity,2021-07-05T11:07:48.258415,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-05T11:06:57.597399,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuezq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuezq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuezq/citation/,tuezq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuezq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuezq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuezq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e2118df83de2035ab000e4/,60e2118df83de2035ab000e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuezq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuezq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuezq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tuezq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tuezq,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742058X21000229
