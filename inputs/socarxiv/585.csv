The study aims to investigate the concept of history used by the writer in the novel and compare it to the concept of traditional approach and the concept of new historicism. The researcher used the analytical approach to show the complexity of The Hostage as a historically situated text, as a creation of the re-thinking, on the part of Dammaj of the concept of history. The natural integration of history and fiction makes Dammaj a natural historian, extracting and presenting a single kernel of meaning. With his narrative art, he is trying to manipulate a continuous parallel between contemporaniety and antiquity. The novel is an attempt by the present in the form of fiction to give a meaning to the past in the form of history. The study concludes that Dammaj was able to use a new approach to history which is his own and which puts him closer to new historicism of European decent.",TRUE,FALSE,Dammaj|historicism|The Hostage|Yemen,2018-07-02T11:54:44.239034,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T18:35:47.255485,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnvkq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnvkq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnvkq/citation/,bnvkq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnvkq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j78ac/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnvkq/relationships/node/,j78ac,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnvkq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b15786064f25a001976eded/,5b15786064f25a001976eded,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnvkq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnvkq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bnvkq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bnvkq/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bnvkq

Eliot’s The Cocktail Party, were very eventful in European drama. In those years, a completely new dramatic movement – the spread of naturalistic prose drama – came into play. On the other hand, verse drama in the twentieth century, and particularly in England and Ireland, came back into the popular theater. At the hands of W.B. Yeats, T.S. Eliot and Christopher Fry, in the main, the dramatists who constituted the chief revolt against naturalism, contemporary verse drama revived against the naturalistic definition of drama, which in a sense considers characterization and action the main ends of drama. The aim of the paper is to compare and contrast the two styles of drama using the criticism of contemporary verse dramatists. The paper delves into the ways these dramatists tried to make verse play and distinguish themselves from naturalists. It continues to prove their failure while showing discontinuity of verse plays’ popularity in the temporary audience’s mind. The question is whether verse dramatists succeeded in instilling a feeling of suspense and popularity in the inner recesses of the audience’s hearts or not; in other words, can verse drama preserve its influence on the audience? The significance of this study is to prove that although the role of verse drama lasted for centuries, its presence nowadays is vanishing as it is losing its power of influence.",TRUE,FALSE,and symbolism|Contemporary verse drama|mystification|naturalism|poetic drama|prose drama|religious plays|verse drama,2018-07-02T11:54:44.206779,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T18:35:25.261353,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/citation/,d8zub,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9w5z7/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/relationships/node/,9w5z7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b15778764f25a000f76ff96/,5b15778764f25a000f76ff96,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d8zub/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d8zub/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.8,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d8zub

It also aims at providing some practical ideas and methods regarding the use of short stories by inquiring about the following questions: What significance can be accorded to the use of short stories in EFL classroom and how can short stories serve as a mediator between the learner’s own culture and other cultures? To address these questions, a questionnaire was collected from 95 third year undergraduate students at Mostaganem University, 24 of the students were selected randomly for an intervention that lasted about 8 weeks. Findings from the questionnaire and experimental study indicate that the study population does not only show positive attitudes towards short stories reading but also manifests a number of signs that reflect their acquisition of cultural issues, they also support the usefulness of examining learners’ cultural knowledge, feelings and experiences before, while and after bringing short stories into the literature class.

The study surveyed 50 female translation students of the Translation Program at Prince Sultan University, Saudi Arabia. The survey consisted of questions about knowledge and use patterns and included texts for translating between English and Arabic. Results show that although the students know and use a variety of online resources, they still lack in awareness of some of the very useful ones, and a small minority of the students does not use monolingual dictionaries at all. Analysis of the students’ translations of selected terms reveals that availability of excellent online resources is not enough to prevent mistranslations if the students cannot select the right equivalent.

These contested terrains have suffered the ramifications of environmental discrimination, which targets them for toxic strip-mining projects.

Twelve English translation in the Spring 2015 edition of Pathlight will be analyzed as a way to develop translation resources. The main approaches to translation are: (1) retaining the original passive sentences and/or passive construction, (2) changing to corresponding active sentences, (3) changing into active sentences with the same narrative perspective, and (4) paraphrasing the original passives. Translation of adversative bèi passive sentences is evaluated from the perspectives of semantic equivalence and aesthetic effect in order to investigate whether they effectively and successfully express the original adversative meaning and represent the original aesthetic effect. Reasons for ineffective and unsuccessful semantic equivalence are analyzed, that include translators failing to recognize the adversative expression of bèi passive, and not paying sufficient attention to preserving the original lexical terms which express the adversative connotation and present the literary effect and adversative resultative compounds in bèi passive.",TRUE,FALSE,adversative bèi passive|aesthetic effect|semantic equivalence|translation evaluation,2018-07-02T11:54:44.052913,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-07T20:34:15.849320,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/citation/,nzx67,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jxyat/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/relationships/node/,jxyat,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b157375f1f2880010642f5d/,5b157375f1f2880010642f5d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzx67/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nzx67/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.4,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nzx67

The story of Umuofia, the fictitious Igbo village, in Achebe's Things Fall Apart (1958) can be read intertextually in light of the non-fictional text of Mary Kingsley, Travels in West Africa (1897) to underline the thrust of authenticity and fidelity of Achebe that makes his fiction true to life. This juxtaposition is further staged to question the stereotypical representation of Africa and Africans through the fictional texts of 19thc British writers such as Joseph Conrad, Rider Haggard among many others. Though it is not a purely historical text, Things Fall Apart is spearheaded against the reductive approach applied by 19thc British writers to deny Africa history and culture wholesale, presenting it on a dire need for the enlightenment and mission civilisatrice of the Westerners. Hence, the ostensible aim to enlighten the African heathens living in utter darkness, to free the African minds from the enslavement of superstition, to liberate African women from the sexual laxity endorsed by the barbaric morals of heathenism is counterpointed in Achebe’s Things Fall Apart. Chiefly, Achebe states that the cultural practices of the African people in their particular African environment down through ages have catered them with particular insights into life that are the bedrock of values and outlooks shaping contemporary African life.

The translation of culture-specific items, such as proverbs, figurative language, reference to religion, mythology or literature, and stylistics, are at the core of the discussion. This paper discusses generally recommended strategies used in translating culture specific items (CSIs), and further analyses and evaluates such strategies as used in two translated Arabic plays; Sa’dallah Wannous’s The Glass Café (1978/2004) and Mamdouh ‘Udwan’s Reflections of a Garbage Collector (1987/2006). The translation strategies used in these two plays are recognized and rationalized in terms of giving a domesticated or a foreignized effect. Besides transferring meaning, the cultural identity of the text is highlighted as a mainstay of the translation process",TRUE,FALSE,translating religious language|translating stylistics|Translation of culture specific items|translation strategies,2018-07-02T11:54:43.950802,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T18:33:34.478995,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5bse/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5bse/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5bse/citation/,m5bse,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5bse/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/rzjsw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5bse/relationships/node/,rzjsw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5bse/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b157019f1f288000e64606b/,5b157019f1f288000e64606b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5bse/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5bse/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5bse/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m5bse/,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol2no2.1,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m5bse

Fewer studies focus on how chronic health conditions influence religious service attendance rates and most focus on older Americans. Using three waves of a nationally representative sample of children in the United States, I test whether children with a chronic health condition never attend religious worship services at rates significantly higher than children without a condition. I also investigate variation in attendance rates across a broad range of conditions, something previously overlooked. Children with chronic health conditions are more likely to never attend religious worship services. Specifically, children with chronic health conditions that impede communication and social interaction are most likely to never attend. Despite shifts in prevalence these findings are stable over time. Implications for researchers, religious communities, families with children with chronic health conditions, and healthcare providers are discussed.",TRUE,FALSE,Children|Chronic health condition|Congregations|Disability|Health|Religion|United States,2018-07-02T11:54:43.854695,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T17:37:40.645706,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufkvw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufkvw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufkvw/citation/,ufkvw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufkvw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gehqw/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufkvw/relationships/node/,gehqw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufkvw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b1562d164f25a001976d422/,5b1562d164f25a001976d422,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufkvw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufkvw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ufkvw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ufkvw/,https://doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12521,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ufkvw

This framework – both in the shape of legislative instruments and case law – has inevitably also affected those asylum seekers who claim asylum on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity (SOGI). This has been vividly demonstrated by particular norms in EU asylum instruments and judgments of the Court of Justice of EU (CJEU).

The current CEAS can be said to have several shortcomings in relation to SOGI claims, including in relation to: country of origin information; the notion of ‘safe country of origin’; the burden of proof and the principle of benefit of the doubt; the concept of a ‘particular social group’; and the definition of persecution. A new set of proposals for reform of the CEAS was put forward in 2016 by the European Commission, and these also affect SOGI asylum claims in precise and acute ways.

This policy brief scrutinises these proposals of reform, and assesses the extent to which these proposals and different institutional positions address, ignore or aggravate the issues that currently affect asylum seekers who identify as LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex). The policy brief makes fifteen recommendations for European policymakers in regards to the reform of the CEAS, in order to ensure that the needs of LGBTI asylum seekers and refugees are effectively addressed and their rights are respected. Academics from the University of Sussex working on the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Claims of Asylum (SOGICA) project, funded by the European Research Council, are calling for policymakers to implement these recommendations in order to render the CEAS fairer for SOGI asylum seekers.",TRUE,FALSE,asylum|CEAS|Common European Asylum System|European Union|gender identity|refugees|sexual orientation,2018-07-02T11:54:43.557081,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-06-04T14:51:22.423053,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c1b|Law|Immigration Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c34|Law|Human Rights Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c35|Law|Sexuality and the Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c53|Law|International Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c67|Law|Legislation|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c70|Law|European Law,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/citation/,pkftr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6ugxk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/relationships/node/,6ugxk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5b153fa6f1f288000f646cce/,5b153fa6f1f288000f646cce,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pkftr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pkftr/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pkftr
