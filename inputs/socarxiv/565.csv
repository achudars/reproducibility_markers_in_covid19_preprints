The text examines the activity of a master charcoal-maker and forest-manager in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan, who works within a landscape recognized by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS)—a place of special cultural and agroecological value. Drawing on theories of the evolution of knowledge and material culture studies, charcoal is seen as embodiment of particular understandings of the agencies of the natural world. Attention to the various stages in the production and use of charcoal sheds light on the structure of this knowledge, especially on the important areas in which qualities of one field of activity are transferred to or become essential to another. These “overlaps” link what otherwise appear to be disparate fields of activity into mutually constitutive elements of a whole. They shed light on the dynamics of cultural persistence and indicate the diversity of forms environmental knowledge; they can amplify understanding of the nature of the Anthropocene.",TRUE,FALSE,"aesthetics and environment|agricultural heritage|anthropocene|binchotan|Craft|""dwelling in craft""|environmental knowledge|environmental perception|material culture",2018-07-02T11:31:06.487671,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-26T14:26:20.145276,NA,NA,no,All figures and photos are original works.

On the other hand, if calling Iran a theocracy means that the Shi’a clergy as an institution rules the country, then this is not an accurate description. The clerical establishment, even after the revolution, has been separate from the regime, even though the relationship between these two entities has changed drastically after the revolution.

Modernity individualizes the self and tends to ignore emotions. As a result, conflict can be caused by sequences in which the total hiding of humiliation leads to vengeance. This essay outlines a theory of the social-emotional world implied in the work of C. H. Cooley and others. Cooley’s concept of the “looking-glass self” can be used as antidote to the assumptions of modernity: the basic self is social and emotional: selves are based on “living in the mind” of others, with a result of feeling either pride of shame. Cooley discusses shame at some length, unlike most approaches, which tend to hide it. This essay proposes that the complete hiding of shame can lead to feedback loops (spirals) with no natural limit: shame about shame and anger is only the first step. Emotion backlogs can feed back when emotional experiences are completely hidden: avoiding all pain can lead to limitless spirals. These ideas may help explain the role of France in causing WWI, and Hitler’s rise to power in Germany. To the extent that these propositions are true, the part played by emotions and especially shame in causing wars need to  be further studied.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:31:05.143728,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-22T15:51:45.449221,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/citation/,eu7ha,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gv52m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/relationships/node/,gv52m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3d28ffad359f000ee65bd1/,5a3d28ffad359f000ee65bd1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eu7ha/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eu7ha/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eu7ha,NA

Using the age variable in GSS and drawing from Generational Cohort Theory, I isolate the generational cohorts baby boomers and millennials and hypothesize that baby boomers will approve of legal abortion in fewer instances than millennials. Moreover, I create Abortion Attitude Indexes from GSS questions on abortion, which enable me to separate the questions into two groups: hard and soft abortions. Drawing from Attribution Theory, I propose that there will be an overall higher approval of hard abortions than soft abortions across both generational cohorts. Ultimately, bivariate and multivariate analysis reported that age and sex are not statistically significant predictors of abortion attitudes. However, religious fundamentalism is moderately significant. Therefore, one hypothesis is supported that the more religiously fundamentalist an individual is, the fewer instances they are likely to approve of legal abortion.",TRUE,FALSE,,2018-07-02T11:31:03.892970,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-22T02:26:02.348812,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/citation/,d6g35,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4b7st/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/relationships/node/,4b7st,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3c57b8732ffd000d928dfe/,5a3c57b8732ffd000d928dfe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d6g35/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d6g35/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d6g35,NA

Our method compares successful and unsuccessful applicants in a lottery used by Pakistan to allocate Hajj visas. Pilgrim accounts stress that the Hajj leads to a feeling of unity with fellow Muslims, but outsiders have sometimes feared that this could be accompanied by antipathy toward non-Muslims. We find that participation in the Hajj increases observance of global Islamic practices, such as prayer and fasting, while decreasing participation in localized practices and beliefs, such as the use of amulets and dowry. It increases belief in equality and harmony among ethnic groups and Islamic sects and leads to more favorable attitudes toward women, including greater acceptance of female education and employment. Increased unity within the Islamic world is not accompanied by antipathy toward non-Muslims.

We call the measure Isolation and anticipate it will be useful as an alternative to commonly used rural classification schemes (e.g., the Census Bureau's measure). Following the best known standards for measuring rurality, it captures the trade-off between access to resource-rich, high-population-density areas and the cost of travel to those areas; thus even intrinsically low-resource areas may have high access to nearby resources. Validity was tested with proxies such as nighttime outdoor lights, distance to hospitals, physician availability, and access to high quality food. The Isolation scale demonstrated good construct validity (i.e., both convergent and criterion validity). Fit statistics indicated that, compared to other commonly-used urban/rural definitions, the Isolation scale was the best overall measure when predicting several proxies for rurality, even when categorized. We also show that the measure does a substantially better job at explaining national health outcome data at the state level. This new continuous Isolation scale shows considerable promise for improving our conceptualization, theorization, and measurement of the features of rurality that are pertinent to rural health disparities research, and can also be useful to policy makers who may find value in using isolation thresholds that are most relevant to their policy planning needs.",TRUE,FALSE,geography|health|measurement|rural,2018-07-02T11:31:02.475973,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-21T14:20:53.726710,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/citation/,4928e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dxn9m/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/relationships/node/,dxn9m,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3bbbc4f22f400010bea95d/,5a3bbbc4f22f400010bea95d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4928e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4928e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4928e,NA

However, researchers are often interested in combinations of relational and categorical nodal attributes. In this case, it is desirable to account for the label, or color, of the nodes in the triad census. In this paper, we describe an efficient algorithm for constructing the colored triad census, based, in part, on existing methods for the classic triad census. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using empirical and simulated data for both undirected and directed graphs. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces computational time by approximately many-fold over the naive approach. We also apply the colored triad census to the Zachary karate club network dataset. We simultaneously show the efficiency of the algorithm, and a way to conduct a statistical test on the census by forming a null distribution from 1,000 realizations of a mixing-matrix conditioned graph and comparing the observed colored triad counts to the expected. From this, we demonstrate the method's utility in our discussion of results about homophily, heterophily, and bridging, simultaneously gained via the colored triad census.

As qualitative researchers are faced with new expectations to share their data, data repositories and academic libraries are working to address the specific challenges of qualitative research data. This paper describes how data repositories and academic libraries can partner with researchers to support three challenges associated with qualitative data sharing: (1) obtaining informed consent from participants for data sharing and scholarly reuse; (2) ensuring that qualitative data are legally and ethically shared; and (3) sharing data that cannot be deidentified. This paper also describes three continuing challenges of qualitative data sharing that data repositories and academic libraries cannot specifically address—research using qualitative big data, copyright concerns, and risk of decontextualization. While data repositories and academic libraries can’t provide easy solutions to these three continuing challenges, they can partner with researchers and connect them with other relevant specialists to examine these challenges. Ultimately, this paper suggests that data repositories and academic libraries can help researchers address some of the challenges associated with ethical and lawful qualitative data sharing.",TRUE,FALSE,data repositories|data sharing|libraries|qualitative data,2018-07-02T11:29:55.873395,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2017-12-21T02:06:14.616596,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/citation/,7z2bt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yvhjd/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/relationships/node/,yvhjd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5a3ae7605a9350000fa55417/,5a3ae7605a9350000fa55417,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7z2bt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7z2bt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7z2bt,NA
