focus on the history of racial discrimination within the American healthcare system. While
studying this discrimination is important, we argue that past research overlooks the role of law enforcement actors outside the healthcare system; both in their history of supporting medical discrimination, and in its contemporary function as a coercive face of the state that may influence Black American’s concerns about vaccines. Using cross-sectional and longitudinal nationally representative surveys, we demonstrate that police attitudes have a strong and causal effect on vaccine skepticism and opposition to pro-vaccine policies among Black Americans. These findings point to the importance of reforming areas outside of the medical field, such as policing, in order to promote lasting declines in vaccine hesitancy.",TRUE,FALSE,COVID19|health disparities|health politics|policing|political psychology|public health|public opinion|vaccine hesitancy,2021-07-05T11:06:47.060811,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-05T11:06:09.244948,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-time-series-study/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjq4a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjq4a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjq4a/citation/,wjq4a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjq4a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjq4a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjq4a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e1e65331881a035f639e97/,60e1e65331881a035f639e97,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjq4a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjq4a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wjq4a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wjq4a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wjq4a,NA

In the name of religion, then the existence of terrorism, sexual harassment and many others. This study aims to find out what the existence of Pancasila values and the application of today's globalization era looks like. Method : This research is using literature review from publications regarding the corresponding topic, along with determined criteria. As is well known, Results : Pancasila is the basis of the Indonesian state, and becomes the guide for all Indonesian people. As it is known that with the existence of Pancasila, all Indonesian people have guideline values in recognizing and solving problems such as politics, social, cultural, religious and others. However, in reality, the value of Pancasila is now starting to fade in social life. This situation can be seen with the many problems that have emerged lately, such as bombing places of worship, the emergence of terrorism activities and so on. If the problems like this are not resolved immediately it will eliminate the value and the meaning of the state guideline, namely Pancasila. Conslusion : This situation can be observed from the emergence of various kinds of problems arising from not applying the values of Pancasila, and if they are not immediately resolved, the values of Pancasila or the meaning of Pancasila may disappear itself. Suggestion : To counteract all the negative impacts of globalization, Indonesian people only need to hold, and actualize the values of Pancasila properly and correctly.",TRUE,FALSE,Globalization|Pancasila|Pancasila Values,2021-07-04T14:47:26.001462,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-04T14:46:54.334397,TRUE,Application pancasila in modern era,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c80|Arts and Humanities|Other Languages, Societies, and Cultures",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27mc8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27mc8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27mc8/citation/,27mc8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27mc8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27mc8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27mc8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e19d2231881a034d63af4a/,60e19d2231881a034d63af4a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27mc8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27mc8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27mc8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/27mc8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/27mc8,NA

These primarily voluntary instruments combine guidance on sustainability strategy and/or monitoring with marketable public information, such as certifications, ratings, and reports, to incentivise take-up. Whilst they are typically based on standardised assessment criteria, recent academic literature emphasises more context-sensitive and systems-based, or ‘regenerative,’ approaches. We evaluate these differing approaches by adapting the concept of ‘legitimacy’, often applied to product certification, for this broader family of governance instruments. Prior research finds that standardised approaches have achieved success in take-up at the expense of other aspects of legitimacy, such as programme effectiveness and informational quality. Yet there remains a need for evaluation of established instruments based on a regenerative approach. We address this need through a focus on the One Planet Living framework established by Bioregional in the UK. Using practice-embedded, mixed-methods research, we identify achievements of the framework in terms of promoting effective, participatory and generally transparent programmes. Key limitations of the more bespoke approach concern take-up, resource requirements and the integration of measurement. Governance instruments for complex strategy and monitoring have, to date, struggled to combine programme effectiveness with scalability, suggesting there remains a need to develop more scalable regenerative approaches.",TRUE,FALSE,legitimacy|regenerative sustainability|regulation|standards|sustainability assessment|sustainability certification,2021-07-04T14:53:25.249283,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-04T14:52:53.951720,TRUE,"The research itself was independently funded and no payment was received from Bioregional, whose sustainability framework is the subject of the evaluation.

Evidence from Seven Developing Countries,"Advocates for school autonomy and decentralisation argue that community involvement in school decisions would bring positive educational outcomes by increasing parent-teacher interaction. In this study, I investigate to what extent community involvement associates with parents-teacher meetings in seven developing countries using Programme for International Student for Development (PISA-D) data-2015. Employing OLS regression models, I find that the correlation between community engagement in various school activities and parent-teacher interaction is largely insignificant. Findings rather suggest that private ownership and, in some cases, higher instructional resources of schools are associated with increasing parent-teacher communication. These findings remain similar in several specifications suggesting that community involvement as part of decentralising the education sector should not be seen as a panacea to overcoming challenges in schools in developing countries.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-07-04T14:44:02.690785,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-04T14:43:41.196450,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisa-for-development/database/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6crej/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6crej/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6crej/citation/,6crej,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6crej/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6crej/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6crej/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60e06488ef8b3f030fbe033f/,60e06488ef8b3f030fbe033f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6crej/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6crej/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6crej/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6crej/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6crej,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedudev.2021.102378

We develop a model that assumes income comparison on a subjective income reference distribution to explain the centralization phenomenon of income evaluation. We conduct theoretical analysis and empirical parameter estimation using Bayesian statistical modeling. The theoretical analysis shows that the centralization of income evaluation distribution occurs when the subjective reference distribution is more dispersed than the objective distribution. Empirical analysis using Japanese data from 2015 shows that the relationship between subjective and objective distributions differed depending on social categories with different social experiences. Women had a more ambiguous distribution than men. Among men, those aged 45--54 had a subjective distribution closest to the objective distribution.

Here, we investigate the latter mechanism using the peer review files of 16.5K manuscripts submitted between 2013-2018 to a field-leading biology journal (Journal A) and a middle-tier journal of similar scope (Journal B). The editorial data are supplemented with authors’ name-inferred ethnicities and extensive controls including submissions’ topic, author prestige, and citation impact, even for rejected-and-published-elsewhere submissions. We find substantial disparities in acceptance across inferred ethnicities and that these are driven by the editors and not peer reviewers. In particular, for a given amount of future impact and other submission characteristics, papers by East Asian-named authors were 4.3-14.6 percentage points less likely to be accepted than those by British-origin-named authors. Journal A editors were about 7.1-8.1 percentage points less likely to send East Asian-authored (Chinese and non-Chinese) papers out for peer review and, for a given level of reviewer enthusiasm, 7.2 percentage points less likely to ultimately accept them (non-Chinese only).

This paper takes issue with that conclusion. Although high incomes are associated with lower fertility in general, both in the cross section and over time (within and between countries), economic crises also lead to lower fertility. I offer a new descriptive analysis using data from the American Community Survey for 2000-2019. In the U.S. case, the fertility decline was widespread after the 2008 recession, but most concentrated among younger women. Although women with above average education have long had lower birth rates, the analysis shows that birth rates fell most for women in states with higher than average unemployment rates, especially among those with below average education.

The Core of Swiss Elite Networks 1910-2015,"This article focuses on historical elite dynamics and investigates elites’ integration over time. We describe the changing relations and composition of the central circles in Swiss elite networks at seven benchmark years between 1910 and 2015 by relying on 22,262 elite individuals tied to 2587 organisations among eight key sectors, and identify for each year the most connected core of individuals. We explore network cohesion and sectoral bridging of the elite core and find that it moved from being a unitary corporate elite following family-based elite reproduction, before 1945, to an integrated corporatist elite involved in educational and professional-based reproduction, between the 1950s and 1980s, before fragmenting into a loose group in the 1990s onwards. The core was always dominated by business and their forms of legitimacy but, at times of crisis to the hegemony of corporate elites, elite circles expanded and included individuals with delegated forms of power, such as politicians and unionists, detaining more university credentials, and less transnational connections and elite family ties.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-07-01T16:31:22.777043,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-01T16:26:15.082366,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y8dh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y8dh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y8dh/citation/,4y8dh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y8dh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y8dh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y8dh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60dde787ef8b3f024fbe0f2c/,60dde787ef8b3f024fbe0f2c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y8dh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y8dh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4y8dh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4y8dh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4y8dh,NA

The impact of this lockdown on levels of well-being has been a source of concern for citizens and mental health professionals.
Objectives: We investigated the trajectory of well-being over the course of the ?first wave and sought to determine whether the change in well-being is distributed equally across the population. Speci?fically we investigated pre-existing medical conditions, social isolation, ?financial stress and deprivation as a predictor for well-being and whether there were community level characteristics which protect against poorer well-being.
Methods: Using online survey responses from the COVID19 modules of Understanding society, we linked 8,379 English cases across ?five waves of data collection to location based deprivation statistics. We used ordinary least squares regression to estimate the association between deprivation, pre-existing conditions and socio-demographic factors and the change in well-being scores over time, as measured by the GHQ-12 questionnaire.
Results: A decline in well-being was observed at the beginning of the fi?rst lock down period at the beginning of March 2020. This was matched with a corresponding recovery between April and July as restrictions were gradually lifted. There was no association between the decline and deprivation, nor between deprivation and 
recovery. The strongest predictor of well-being during the lockdown, was the baseline score, with the counterintuitive 
finding that for those will pre-existing poor well-being, the impact of pandemic restrictions on mental health were minimal, but for those who had previously felt well, the restrictions and the impact of the pandemic on well-being were much greater.
Conclusion: These data show no evidence of a social gradient in well-being related to the pandemic. In fact, wellbeing was shown to be highly elastic in this period indicating a national level of resilience which cut across the usually observed health inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,COVI-19|deprivation|inequality|lonliness|mental health|pandemic|resilience|wellbeing,2021-07-04T02:50:23.965703,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-07-04T02:50:12.962028,FALSE,NA,no,Data are available under end user license from the UK Data Archive,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv4qs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv4qs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv4qs/citation/,pv4qs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv4qs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv4qs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4/,60bf983b58510b0009a5a9a4,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv4qs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60ddc95aef8b3f024bbdab6f/,60ddc95aef8b3f024bbdab6f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv4qs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv4qs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pv4qs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pv4qs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pv4qs,NA
