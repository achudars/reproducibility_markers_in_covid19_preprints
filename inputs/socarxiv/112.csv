India's Rural Employment Guarantee and Maoist Conflict,"Theory and extensive evidence connect poverty and underdevelopment to civil conflict, yet evidence on the impact of development programs on violence is surprisingly mixed. To break this impasse, we exploit a within-country policy experiment to examine the conditions under which anti-poverty programs reduce violence. The roll-out of India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme caused a large long-run reduction in Maoist conflict violence, as measured with an original data set based on local language press sources. These pacifying effects were not uniform, however, but overwhelmingly concentrated in districts with sufficient pre-existing local state capacity to implement the program effectively.

Influential theories suggest that technological change represents a form of creative destruction that can weaken incumbents and strengthen outsiders, leading to political turnover. This paper investigates a large-scale historical natural experiment: the impact of the green revolution on single-party dominance in India. Drawing on a theoretical framework based on models of contests, this paper argues that high-yielding variety (HYV) crops strengthened the incentives and capacity of a politically excluded group, in this case agricultural producers, to seek greater political representation. Exploiting the timing of the introduction of HYV crops, together with district-level variation in suitability for the new crop technology, instrumental variables analyses show that the green revolution played a pivotal role in the rise of agrarian opposition parties and decline of single-party dominance.

While yielding valuable insight regarding the importance of place, this body of work reproduces racism through explicit and implicit appeals to White-centered sensibility and desirability. In this chapter, we examine two specific Chicago School-inspired theories and related empirical work—spatial assimilation and place stratification. We draw from Du Boisian, racial capitalism, and other critical perspectives to illuminate the racial logics buoying this research. Where urban sociology underscores linear progression towards or digression from Whiteness, we emphasize urban heterogeneity and the intentional, non-linear or cyclical production of urban communities.

Yet, lockdown measures may induce mental health problems and increase the occurrence of domestic violence (DV). We examine mental health and DV in lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual and asexual (LGB+) persons under lockdown. Methods: An online self-report questionnaire on relationships, stress and aggression was administered to a non-probabilistic sample of participants living in Belgium. Participants were sampled through national media, social media, and snowballing procedures. Occurrence of DV including psychological, physical and sexual violence, stress, alcohol and drug use, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, self-harming behaviour, and help-seeking behaviour in LGB+ persons during the first four to six weeks of the hygiene and lockdown measures in Belgium were assessed. Results: 383 LGB+ participants were included in the analysis. In addition to high levels of stress, alcohol and drug abuse, suicidal ideation and self-harming behaviour, a third of LGB+ participants reported at least one incident of DV under lockdown. Conclusion: LGB+ persons have been exposed to DV and experienced lower mental health and wellbeing during the lockdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This paper draws lessons from the reaction of sovereign bond markets to franchise extensions between 1800 and 1920. If franchise extension transferred political power from economic and financial elites to workers, as redistributive theories of democratization suggest, then this should have resulted in a fall in the market price (increase in the yield) of a country’s bonds. Exploiting the asynchronous timing of franchise reforms across countries, we provide evidence that franchise extension contributed to large increases in the premium demanded by investors to hold sovereign debt, reflecting an increased risk of default. However, bond markets became less sensitive to franchise extensions over time, a pattern potentially due to the structure of inequality and the strategic adoption of institutions which protected financial interests.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-01-13T04:02:04.109997,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-11T21:01:11.963911,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/WR97GH,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,Aditya Dasgupta and Daniel Ziblatt,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2pqn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2pqn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2pqn/citation/,s2pqn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2pqn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2pqn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2pqn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ffb919086541a028d14c313/,5ffb919086541a028d14c313,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2pqn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2pqn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s2pqn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s2pqn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s2pqn,NA

The Body Mass Index (BMI), weight is divided by height squared, is used to screen for obesity: a person ≥30 kg/m2 is ‘obese’; between 25 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2 is ‘overweight’. In 2016, 1.6 billion adults (18 years +), were overweight, of which 650 million were obese. Obesity is a major burden of disease (WHO, 2020) not only in high-income countries, but also in low-income (e.g. Eritrea) and middle income countries (e.g. India) (Malik, Willett &amp; Hu, 2013). Obesity has become a pandemic with projections pointing to 38% of Earth’s population becoming overweight and 20% obese by 2030 (Anekwe et al., 2020). Obesity in the UK is also on the rise: it affects 1 in 4 adults, 1 in 10 children aged 4-5, and 1 in 5 children aged 10-11 (NHS, 2020). 63% of adults and 33% of children leaving primary school are above a healthy weight (Public Health England, [PHE], 2020).
Obesity is linked to a number of chronic and debilitating conditions like cardio-metabolic risk (CMR) (i.e. metabolic syndrome, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular disease or stroke) and to conditions such as depression which can impact on an individual’s lifecycle.  This paper will explore these links and further look at food insecurity and how it could contribute to obesity as well as how socioeconomic inequalities impact on this. It will then  seek to evaluate the latest policy of the UK government on ‘Tackling Obesity: empowering adults and children to live healthier lives’ (UK Government, 2020) with a view to exploring whether this policy is appropriate in addressing food insecurity to prevent obesity. It will then conclude with some recommendations.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-01-13T03:59:23.685212,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-11T20:58:08.081594,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Counseling Psychology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rf4a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rf4a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rf4a/citation/,3rf4a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rf4a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rf4a/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rf4a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ffb831986541a028d14afa8/,5ffb831986541a028d14afa8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rf4a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rf4a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3rf4a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3rf4a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3rf4a,NA
