The Poster aims to study, from a functional and typological point of view, the fire installations and the contextual kitchen pottery in the Central Anatolia during the Late Bronze Age (1650-1200 B.C.). In particular, the archaeological contexts of the main Hittite sites of Anatolian Plateau, subjects of major interest in recent years, will be examined. The analysis and the comparison of the cooking tools (fireplaces, ovens, pots and baking plates) will allow to obtain some conclusions on the “Hittite Cuisine”, namely on the cooking techniques and the types of food consumed in the heart of Hittite kingdom.

This entails a broad understanding of elites, understood, however, as small-N entities. On this understanding, elites can then be characterised through prosopographical methods – the construction of collective biographies of their members. A better understanding may thus be gained of the degree of social exclusiveness of different elites, and on this basis further questions can be taken up of how far exclusiveness results from the varying processes through which elites are formally constituted and how far from the composition of the pools within which such elite recruitment occurs. Finally, questions can be addressed of the implications of social skewness in elite formation for equality of opportunity and for the wastage of talent that inequality entails, and then further for the so far sociologically neglected issue of the level of performance – the effectiveness – of elites in whatever field they exist.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-03-15T17:51:49.725743,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-15T17:51:24.776407,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5q6cf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5q6cf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5q6cf/citation/,5q6cf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5q6cf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5q6cf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5q6cf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604f9b72b57c9c028b807bbf/,604f9b72b57c9c028b807bbf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5q6cf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5q6cf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5q6cf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5q6cf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5q6cf

Agile Methods in British and German Government Institutions,"This thesis project developed an online data collection and analysis system to trace the evolution and spread of agile methods in British and German government institutions. Agile methods are rooted in the software development departments of the private sector and are characterised by an iterative development process that focuses on the user. As the digital transformation gains ground in the public sector, these methods are also becoming more relevant to government institutions. Yet, public management literature still lacks an understanding of the temporal and spatial evolution of this development. To fill this research gap, this study analysed the occurrence of agile methods related keywords on British and German government websites over time. A total of 49 government domains were crawled and 171,569 potentially agile related pages downloaded. After preprocessing (e.g. extracting the publishing organisation’s name and the publishing date) and cleaning the data, 451 relevant sites were left. The analysis showed that the number of agile related sites published by government institutions as well as the number of government domains publishing agile sites increased over time and particularly in recent years (289% increase in number of published sites from 2017 to 2019). Furthermore, it revealed that 84% of agile sites also mention digital transformation related keywords. German federal and state level institutions published a total of 74 agile related pages, the first one in 2015, and the most active bodies turned out to be the Federal Ministry of Labour &amp; Social Aairs and the state of Baden-Württemberg. The Federal Government Office and the Bavarian government lead in terms of most detailed methods description. On the other hand, Britons have been discussing agile methods on their government web presences since 2011 (380 pages in total), while the lead institutions in terms of number of sites published are the Government Digital Service and the Cabinet Office. With regard to the depth of agile methods descriptions the leaders are the Home Office and the Education &amp; Skills Funding Agency. When comparing British and German central government ministerial departments, the wide lead – in terms of all three, quantity, timing, and depth – of the British institutions becomes apparent. To catch up, Germans should more strongly acknowledge the strategic relevance of agile methods for government’s digital transformation, and consider establishing distinct lighthouse institutions that internally push the application of agile methods and openly talk about it so that other institutions can follow. Future work could include further relevant actors such as NGOs, consultancies or media outlets in the analysis to possibly reveal who ”drives” the adoption of agile methods in government institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,agile government|agile methods|comparative research design|dictionary approach|digital transformation|natural language processing|public management|public sector|public sector innovation|public sector institutions|text-as-data|web-crawling,2021-03-17T03:31:02.961007,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17T03:30:49.951526,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be provided upon request.,,no,Data collection and analysis was purely explorative.,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j4sh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j4sh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j4sh/citation/,3j4sh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j4sh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j4sh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j4sh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604f8b58b57c9c02908076c2/,604f8b58b57c9c02908076c2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j4sh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j4sh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j4sh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3j4sh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3j4sh

The causal mediating role of parenting in SES differences in children’s language development,"This study estimates how much of the effect of parental socioeconomic status (SES) on children’s language development is mediated through parenting styles, practices, and parental investments and whether the effects of early literacy-related parenting practices are heterogeneous. Previous studies suggest SES gaps in language skills among preschoolers result from differences in parenting. However, the extent to which parenting mediates the effects of growing up in low-SES contexts, and whether parenting may have heterogeneous effects are still unknown. This paper uses data from the National Educational Panel Study starting cohort 1, a random sample of N=1892 children born between 2012 and 2013 in Germany. The paper uses latent class analysis to measure SES and joint mediation analysis to estimate the mediated share of the SES effect on children’s language going through parenting. Quantile regression is used to explore heterogeneity in the effects of parenting practices to further explain the mediated share.
Parenting explains or mediates around half of the total effect of SES, and the positive effect of parenting practices are heterogeneous, affecting mostly children around the first quartile of the distribution of language skills. Although a large chunk of the SES effect operates through parenting, and parenting practices positively impact children,
their effects on reducing gaps in language skills are limited.

This systematic review compiles studies that consider the health and well-being outcomes of grandparenting, concerning (i) custodial grandparent families, where grandparents are raising children without parental presence; (ii) three-generation households, where grandparents are living with adult children and grandchildren; and (iii) non-coresiding grandparents, who are involved in the lives of their grandchildren.
Research Design and Methods: This systematic review was based on literature searches conducted in September 2019 via Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Ebsco. We screened 3,868 abstracts across four databases, and by following the PRISMA guidelines, we identified ninety-two relevant articles (117 studies) that were published between 1978 and 2019.
Results: In 68% of cases custodial grandparenting was associated with decreased health and wellbeing of grandparents. The few studies considering the health and well-being of grandparents living in three-generation households provided mixed findings (39% positive; 39% negative). Finally, in 69% of cases involvement of non-coresiding grandparents was associated with improved grandparental outcomes; however, there was only limited support for the prediction that involved grandparenting being causally associated with grandparental health and well-being.
Discussion and Implications: The findings are discussed separately among these three groups of grandparents, including reference to possible causal relations between involved grandparenting and grandparental health and well-being.

Our study aimed to explore perceptions and experiences of abortion QOC in England and Wales.
Methods: We performed in-depth interviews (via phone or in-person) with participants who had an abortion at a nationwide independent sector provider in the previous 6 months. We explored their experiences of the abortion service at each point in the care pathway, their perspectives on what contributed to and detracted from the experience meeting their definitions of quality, and their reflections on different aspects of QOC. We used content analysis to generate themes. 
Results: From December 2018 to July 2019, we conducted 24 interviews. Ten participants had a surgical and 14 had a medical abortion. Seventeen (71%) were treated in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and 7 (29%) beyond that, with an average gestational age of 10 weeks + 5 days (range 5-23 + 6). We identified 4 major themes that contributed to participant’s perception of high quality care: 1) interpersonal interactions with staff or other patients, 2) being informed and prepared, 3) participation and choices in care and 4) accessibility. Nearly all participants identified interpersonal interactions with staff as an important contributor to quality with positive interactions often cited as the best part of their abortion experience and negative interactions as the worst. For information and preparation, participant described not only the importance of being well prepared, but how incongruencies between information and the actual experience detracted from quality. Participants said that making choices about their care, for example, method of abortion, was a positive contributor. Finally, participants identified access to care, specifically in relation to waiting times and travel, as an important aspect of QOC. 
Conclusions: Participants situated quality in abortion care in 4 domains: interpersonal aspects of care, information and preparation, choices, and accessibility.

suggested an analogy between the Mesopotamian bevelled-rim bowl dated to the Uruk 
Period and the Old Kingdom Egyptian bedja. They concluded that, as most surely verified 
for the bedja, the bevelled-rim bowls could have also had the function of a container for 
baking. 
To enhance this hypothesis, the two authors pointed out that also a Late Neolithic pottery 
shape of the Near East, the so-called husking trays, were supposedly used for baking. 
In  recent  years,  studies  related  to  ancient  baking  thanks  to  the  adoption  of  new ad 
hoc methods, have received an impressive impulse. New discoveries about ancient bread 
production, husking trays and bevelled-rim bowls interestingly all seem to go in the same 
direction. 
Although it is not currently possible to retrace an uninterrupted sequential line throughout 
the time, all of these discoveries could mutually strengthen one another, suggesting the 
possible existence of an ancient pot baking tradition in the Near East.",TRUE,FALSE,Bread|Experimental Archaeology|Food|Function|Near East|Pottery|Use-wear,2021-03-16T06:00:02.511811,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-16T05:59:45.997452,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76ceb|Arts and Humanities|History of Art, Architecture, and Archaeology",,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbwhg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbwhg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbwhg/citation/,mbwhg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbwhg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbwhg/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbwhg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604f0f7736e58b025fbc25b1/,604f0f7736e58b025fbc25b1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbwhg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbwhg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mbwhg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mbwhg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mbwhg

Yet, when it comes to living and working as a nurse, the policies that guide them are restricted to reproducing narrow definitions of what it is to be human (Haraway, 2016). We argue that paradigms of care create idealized patients (Smith and Willis, 2020) and ‘Vitruvian’ nurses using metaphors as modes of regulation.  

We argue with the concept of the Vitruvian man (Braidotti, 2013) to create the concept of the Vitruvian nurse. As the Vitruvian man is a version of the ideal human, the Vitruvian nurse is established as an axiomatic mechanism to govern care. We argue that this is misogynistic and reproduces restrictive power relations.  

The metaphor of the Vitruvian nurse is a uniformed woman who goes out of her way to attend to everyone's needs in an unconditional and subservient way where her self-value correlates with her ability to serve others at the detriment of herself. The Vitruvian nurse is achieved when she ceases to exist as a subjective entity, therefore becoming an impossibility.  

Contemporary nursing systems that maintain ideas such as Florence Nightingale are colonial (Wytenbroek and Vandenberg, 2017), patriarchal and reproduce knowledge production systems which we find troubling i.e. the white European male mutates into the white European female nurse, and is the perfect nurse. This completely unachievable metaphor becomes a mechanism of control and leads to feelings of isolation, boredom and burnout, which again is a metaphor for the epoch advanced capitalism that we live in. Feminine histories are overwritten to create care as a branded commodity.   

This metaphor is built on assumptions of the liminal human as an individual not a dividual, the individualistic (and neo-liberal) nature of patient centered care and that the care described in nursing codes of practice reveres the ‘autonomous’ practitioner over the material-discursive practices of care. Therefore, an irrefutable future is predetermined by the narrow philosophies of humanistic science - the human as a bound individual is privileged above everything. If we recognize the metaphors of the Vitruvian, and of boredom and burnout - in the times of the posthuman convergence - then what are the affirmative futures that we can produce?",TRUE,FALSE,Critical posthumanism|Nursing,2021-03-16T05:59:20.826028,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-16T05:58:54.663507,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27vaq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27vaq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27vaq/citation/,27vaq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27vaq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27vaq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27vaq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604f0f5836e58b0252bc1470/,604f0f5836e58b0252bc1470,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27vaq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27vaq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/27vaq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/27vaq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/27vaq
