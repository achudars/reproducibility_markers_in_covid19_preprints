Since then, several researchers have used the approach he developed to calculate the costs of poverty for most of the Canadian provinces. This research has had a substantial impact on the thinking of the public and policy makers around poverty and poverty reduction in Canada. In this working paper, we distill the central tenants of Laurie’s approach and recommend several improvements that can be made to it. In effect, Laurie’s approach works with readily available data to answer the counterfactual question: what would the savings and gains be to individuals and society if we raised the standard of living of the poor to the modest level achieved by the second income quintile or higher? In several places, however, his approach results in estimates of costs that are insensitive to changes in widely recognized measures of poverty, including Canada’s new Official Poverty Line, otherwise known as the Market  Basket Measure (MBM). In the latter sections of this paper, we reproduce Laurie’s original calculations and contrast these with results based on our own recommendations in the same year.

Social media are important information dissemination platforms that can augment traditional channels communicating public health recommendations. The objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 public health messaging on Twitter when delivered by emergency physicians and containing personal narratives. 
Methods: On April 30, 2020, we randomly assigned 2007 U.S. adults to an online survey using a 2x2 factorial design. Participants rated 1 of 4 simulated Twitter posts varied by messenger type (emergency physician vs federal official) and content (personal narrative vs impersonal guidance). Main outcomes were: perceived message effectiveness (35-point scale); perceived attitude effectiveness (15-point scale); likelihood to share Tweets (7-point scale); and writing a letter to their governor to continue COVID-19 restrictions (write letter or none).
Results: The physician/personal message had the strongest effect and significantly improved all main messaging outcomes except for letter-writing. Unadjusted mean differences between physician/personal and federal/impersonal were: perceived messaging effectiveness (3.2 [95%CI, 2.4-4.0]); perceived attitude effectiveness (1.3 [95%CI, 0.8-1.7]); likelihood to share (0.4 [95%CI, 0.15-0.7]). For letter-writing, physician/ personal made no significant impact compared to federal/ impersonal (odds ratio 1.14 [95%CI, 0.89-1.46]). 
Conclusions: Emergency physicians sharing personal narratives on Twitter are perceived to be more effective at communicating COVID-19 health recommendations compared to federal officials sharing impersonal guidance.",TRUE,FALSE,civic engagement|COVID-19|emergency physicians|health education|perceived message effectiveness|physician advocacy|public health|public health messaging|randomized controlled trial|randomized experiment|social media|survey experiment|twitter,2020-12-06T16:01:43.926845,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-06T16:01:15.886552,FALSE,NA,no,Please contact the corresponding author for data sharing agreement,,available,NA,https://osf.io/kabvr/,prereg_both,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/citation/,am49t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t8g5w/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/relationships/node/,t8g5w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fcc0caeaa60b802c78949bb/,5fcc0caeaa60b802c78949bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/am49t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/am49t,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14188

Although, certain experiments in nuclear physics, technology and engineering have some dual use character, all research conducted in the life sciences carries the potential to be deliberately misused. Minimising the risks and threats to society that are posed by the misuse of such research warrants putting in place mechanisms that caution, safeguard and prepare those that work with DUR. At the inter/national level, instruments to do so include laws and regulations that forbid the misuse of life sciences research techniques to develop weapons of mass destruction. They also restrict and control the exchange of high-risk biological agents and equipment. At the institutional level, efforts to govern DUR are often voluntary and done through codes of conduct, increasing awareness, as well as training members about the dual use potential of their research. This then equips an individual researcher working with such institutions to identify possible misuse of DUR to identify if misuse of  and  could  with which DUR is conducted and it's misuse may be identified. While researchers associated with academic and government funded institutions carefully scrutinise the potential of misuse of DUR, the same is not reflected in privately funded biopharmaceutical institutions. Despite being a significant part of the life sciences community and carrying out extensive DUR only This implies that besides the laws and regulations that govern DUR at the (inter)national level, the biopharmaceutical industry is expected to voluntarily initiate and address dual use concerns at the institutional and individual level. 
Thus, following an inventory of the various instruments available for the governance of DUR, the approaches adopted by 10 leading companies in the global biopharmaceutical market to address dual use issues were analysed. 
The results revealed that only 1 out of the 10 companies identified the potential misuse of high risk biological agents and the need to ensure biosecurity within the company. However, there was no explicit mention of dual use issues even though, instruments that deal with other ethical problems encountered by an employee, are in place. Also, owing to insufficient attention given to dual use issues in this industry, there is a serious lack of awareness and expertise that is crucial to dealing with such dilemmas.

Moreover, few studies have examined heterogeneity in the contribution of known risk factors to dementia across these demographic strata while properly accounting for the semi-competing risk of death. To better characterize sources of inequality in the risk of dementia, I calculated the proportion of dementia cases attributable to socioeconomic, lifestyle, and medical risk factors across demographic strata using data from the US Health and Retirement Study and a multistate framework that accounts for the semi-competing risk of death. Socioeconomic resources contributed to the largest number of dementia cases but the magnitude of this contribution varied across strata defined by race/ethnicity and gender. The greatest potential for dementia prevention was observed among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic men and women, supporting an intersectionality approach, and underscoring the need for culturally sensitive intervention and public health initiatives to address the growing burden of dementia.",TRUE,FALSE,dementia|health inequality|intersectionality|mortality|multistate|population attributable fraction,2020-12-06T05:15:40.620293,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-06T05:15:14.225627,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/data-products,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3rn6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3rn6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3rn6/citation/,a3rn6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3rn6/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3rn6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3rn6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fca89236ebcc6024b46cb0b/,5fca89236ebcc6024b46cb0b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3rn6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3rn6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a3rn6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a3rn6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a3rn6,NA

Comparing calculated and self-reported accounts,"Accessibility is increasingly recognised as a key purpose of transport policies. Most of the common practices found both in academic studies and policy planning draw on relatively simple accessibility measures taken as ‘objective’ indicators that only focus on the interaction between land use and transport. Relatively little attention has been paid to heterogeneity in individual characteristics and in self-reported perceptions of accessibility (‘subjective’ indicators), and the corresponding differences with respect to available modal options. This study includes a comparison of (1) ‘objective’ indicators of accessibility to key activities by various modes of transport; and (2) individuals’ own perceptions of their capability to access valuable out-of-home activities and the modal options available to them. This study examines the key differences between the two representations of accessibility. The calculated measure was developed using door-to-door travel times to supermarkets and healthcare centres using OpenTripPlanner. The self-reported measure was based on a dedicated capability-oriented travel survey of people aged 65-79 in Sweden’s large metropolitan regions: Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and binary and multinomial logistic regressions. The results of this study allow us to gain a greater insight into the ways in which the two accounts differ and can complement one another. We find that conventional transport methods, by overlooking the heterogeneity in people’s perceptions of their accessibility, tend to overestimate accessibility levels and underestimate accessibility inequalities. This study shows how perceived accounts of accessibility can be incorporated into conventional accessibility models and improve accessibility analyses.",TRUE,FALSE,Accessibility|Capability Approach|Mobility|Older people|Self-reported accessibility|Subjective,2020-12-06T05:14:41.001201,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-06T05:14:21.128072,FALSE,NA,no,NA,,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography,,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja34d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja34d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja34d/citation/,ja34d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja34d/identifiers/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja34d/relationships/node/,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja34d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fca69a16ebcc6024546d794/,5fca69a16ebcc6024546d794,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja34d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja34d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ja34d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ja34d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ja34d,NA
