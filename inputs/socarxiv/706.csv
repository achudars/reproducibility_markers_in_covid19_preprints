infringement of patents in a wide variety of technologies. With a very few
exceptions, the statute does not distinguish between different technologies
in setting and applying legal standards. In theory, then, we have a unified
patent system that provides technology-neutral protection to all kinds of
technologies.

Of late, however, we have noticed an increasing divergence between the
rules themselves and the application of the rules to different industries.
The best examples are biotechnology and computer software. In biotechnology
cases, the Federal Circuit has bent over backwards to find biotechnological
inventions nonobvious, even if the prior art demonstrates a clear plan for
producing the invention. On the other hand, the court has imposed stringent
enablement and written description requirements on biotechnology patents
that do not show up in other disciplines. In computer software cases, the
situation is reversed. The Federal Circuit has essentially excused software
inventions from compliance with the enablement and best mode requirements,
but has done so in a way that raises serious questions about how
stringently it will read the nonobviousness requirements. As a practical
matter, it appears that while patent law is technology-neutral in theory,
it is technology-specific in application.

The paper explains how the application of the same general legal standards
can lead to such different results in diverse industries. Much of the
variance in patent standards is attributable to the use of a legal
construct, the ""person having ordinary skill in the art"" (PHOSITA), to
determine obviousness and enablement. The more skill those in the art have,
the less information an applicant has to disclose in order to meet the
enablement requirement - but the harder it is to meet the nonobviousness
requirement. The level of skill in the art affects not just patent
validity, but also patent scope.

We do not challenge the idea that the standards in each industry should
vary with the level of skill in that industry. We think the use of the
PHOSITA provides needed flexibility for patent law, permitting it to adapt
to new technologies without losing its essential character. We fear,
however, that the Federal Circuit has not applied that standard properly in
either the biotechnology or computer software fields. The court has a
perception of both fields that was set in earlier cases but which does not
reflect the modern realities of either industry. The changes in an industry
over time present significant structural problems for patent law, both
because law is necessarily backward-looking and precedent-bound and because
applying different standards to similar inventions raises concerns about
horizontal equity. Nonetheless, we believe the courts must take more care
than they currently do to ensure that their assessments of patent validity
are rooted in understandings of the technology that were accurate at the
time the invention was made.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:45:06.757685,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:18:32.706000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/citation/,26zn4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vgw4a/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/relationships/node/,vgw4a,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bccbbf9ad5a101f468d449/,57bccbbf9ad5a101f468d449,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/26zn4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/26zn4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/26zn4

license any standard-essential patent on Fair, Reasonable, and

disputes have recently broken out over just what these “FRAND commitments”
mean and how and where to enforce them. We propose a simple, practical set
of rules regarding patents that SSOs can adopt to achieve the goals of
FRAND commitments far more efficiently with far less litigation. Under our
proposed approach, if an standard-essential patent owner and an implementer
of the standard cannot agree on licensing terms, the standard-essential
patent owner is obligated to enter into binding baseball-style (or “final
offer”) arbitration with any willing licensee to determine the royalty
rate. This obligation may be conditioned on the implementer making a
reciprocal FRAND Commitment for any standard-essential patents it owns that
read on the same standard. If the implementer is unwilling to enter into
binding arbitration, the standard-essential patent owner’s FRAND commitment
not to go to court to enforce its standard-essential patents against that
party is discharged. We explain how our proposed FRAND regime would work in
practice. Many of the disputes currently arising around FRAND commitments

but also infringement and unenforceability. Moreover, we relate the
outcomes of those cases to a host of variables, including variables related
to the parties, the patents, and the courts in which those cases were
litigated. The result is a comprehensive picture of the outcomes of modern
patent litigation, one that confirms conventional wisdom in some respects

years ago, courts required affirmative evidence of agreement to form a
contract. No court had enforced a shrinkwrap license, much less treated a
unilateral statement of preferences as a binding agreement. Today, by
contrast, it seems widely (though not universally) accepted that if you
write a document and call it a contract, courts will enforce it as a
contract even if no one agrees to it. Every court to consider the issue has
found clickwrap licenses, in which a user clicks I agree to standard form
terms, enforceable. A majority of courts in the last ten years have
enforced shrinkwrap licenses, on the theory that people agree to the terms
by using the software they have already purchased. Finally, and more
recently, an increasing number of courts have enforced browsewrap licenses,
in which the user does not see the contract at all but in which the license
terms provide that using a Web site constitutes agreement to a contract
whether the user knows it or not. Collectively, we can call these
agreements terms of use because they control (or purport to control) the
circumstances under which buyers of software or visitors to a public Web
site can make use of that software or site.

The rise of terms of use has drawn a great deal of attention because of the
mass-market nature of the resulting agreements. Terms of use are drafted
with consumers or other small end users in mind. Commentators - myself
among them - have focused on the impact of this new form of contract on
consumers. But in the long run they may have their most significant impact
not on consumers but on businesses. The law has paid some attention to the
impact of terms of use on consumers. Virtually all of the cases that have
refused to enforce a browsewrap license have done so in order to protect
consumers; conversely, virtually all the cases that have enforced
browsewrap licenses have done so against a commercial entity. And
shrinkwrap and clickwrap cases, while enforcing some contracts against
consumers, have protected those consumers against certain clauses
considered unreasonable. Businesses, however, are presumed to know what
they are doing when they access another company's Web site, so courts are
more likely to bind them to that site's terms of use. Sophisticated
economic entities are unlikely to persuade a court that a term is
unconscionable. And because employees are agents whose acts bind the
corporation, the proliferation of terms of use means that a large company
is likely agreeing to dozens or even hundreds of different contracts every
day, merely by using the Internet. And because no one ever reads those
terms of use, those multiple contracts are likely to have a variety of
different terms that create obligations inconsistent with each other and
with the company's own terms of use.

We have faced a situation like this before, decades ago. As
business-to-business commerce became more common in the middle of the 20th
Century, companies began putting standard contract terms on the back of
their purchase orders and shipment invoices. When each side to a contract
used such a form, courts had to confront the question of whose form
controlled. After unsuccessful judicial experimentation with a variety of
rules, the Uniform Commercial Code resolved this battle of the forms by
adopting a compromise under which if the terms conflicted, neither party's
terms became part of the contract unless the party demonstrated its
willingness to forego the deal over it. Rather, the default rules of
contract law applied where the parties' standard forms disagreed, but where
neither party in fact insisted on those terms.

I have three goals in this paper. First, I explain how courts came to
enforce browsewrap licenses, at least in some cases. Second, I suggest that
if browsewraps are to be enforceable at all, enforcement should be limited
to the context in which it has so far occurred - against sophisticated
commercial entities who are repeat players. Finally, I argue that even in
that context the enforcement of browsewraps creates problems for common
practice that need to be solved. Business-to-business (b2b) terms of use
are the modern equivalent of the battle of the forms. We need a parallel
solution to this battle of the terms. In Part I, I describe the development
of the law to the point where assent is no longer even a nominal element of
a contract. In Part II, I explain how the recent decisions concerning
browsewrap licenses likely bind businesses but not consumers, and the
problems that will create for commercial litigation. Finally, in Part III,
I discuss possible ways to solve this coming problem and some broader
implications the problem may have for browsewrap licenses generally.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:49:10.923470,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:11:39.419000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/citation/,gf4st,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zuqks/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/relationships/node/,zuqks,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcca1c6c613b01ebd9320d/,57bcca1c6c613b01ebd9320d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gf4st/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gf4st/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gf4st

system is that due to continuation practice it is impossible for the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) ever to finally reject a patent
application. Continuation applications have led to abuse of the patent
prosecution process. They serve very little useful purpose, and what
benefits they confer may be outweighed by their potential for mischief. In
an effort to study the pervasiveness of continuation practice, we compiled
an original dataset comprising 2,224,379 patents, every patent issued from
1976 through 2000. We found that while continuations are filed in 23% of
all patent applications, patents based on continuation applications
represent 52% of all litigated patents. Although continuations are used in
a minority of all patents, it is the most important minority because it is
the minority most likely to end up in litigation. We examine the efforts
undertaken to control the problems associated with continuation patents
(changing the patent term, publishing applications, prosecution laches) and
find them insufficient. The world would probably be a better place if they
were abolished. Recognizing, however, that the abuse of continuation
practice is not as pervasive as some might think, we propose a number of
means by which Congress and the courts could strengthen existing rules
designed to limit their abuse while preserving the practice. At a minimum,
the empirical data we present can provide litigants and judges with a
baseline for assessing the reasonableness of delay caused by the filing of

Office has no way of identifying the small number of applications that are
likely to end up having real economic significance. Thus patent
applications are for the most part treated alike, with every application
getting the same - and by necessity sparse - review. In this short magazine
piece, we urge in response three basic reforms. First, we would weaken the
presumption of validity that today attaches to all issued patents. The
modern strong presumption simply does not reflect the reality of patent
review; presumptions, in short, should be earned. Second, because
legitimate inventors need as much certainty as the law can provide, we
would give applicants the option of earning a presumption of validity by
paying for a thorough examination of their inventions. Put differently,
applicants should be allowed to ""gold-plate"" their patents by paying for
the kind of searching review that would merit a strong presumption of
validity. Third and finally, because competitors also have useful
information about which patents worry them and which do not, we support
instituting a post-grant opposition system, a process by which parties
other than the applicant would have the opportunity to request and fund a
thorough examination of a recently issued patent. As we explain in the
piece, these reforms would together allow the Patent Office to focus its
resources on patents that might actually matter, and it would also both
reduce the incentive to file patents of questionable validity and reduce
the harm caused by such patents in any event.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:51:48.957520,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T22:07:50.499000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/citation/,px9g5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8bgtu/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/relationships/node/,8bgtu,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcc9379ad5a101fa68d554/,57bcc9379ad5a101fa68d554,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/px9g5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/px9g5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/px9g5

patents - have a disproportionate effect on the patent system. They are
responsible for a sizeable fraction of all patent lawsuits. Their patents
should be among the strongest, according to all economic measures of patent
quality. And logic suggests that repeat patent plaintiffs should be risk
averse, settling more of their cases and taking only the very best to trial
to avoid having their patents invalidated. In this paper, we test those
hypotheses. We find that repeat patent plaintiffs are somewhat more likely
to settle their cases. But, to our surprise, we find that when they do go
to trial or judgment, overwhelmingly they lose. This result seems to be
driven by two parallel findings: both software patents and patents owned by
non-practicing entities (so-called ""patent trolls"") fare extremely poorly
in court. We offer some possible explanations for why a group of apparently
weak patents nonetheless have so much influence over the patent system, and
some preliminary thoughts about how these findings should shape the patent
reform debate.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,Preprint|socarxiv,2018-07-02T10:46:32.462626,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2016-08-23T21:52:01.988000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7spjx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7spjx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7spjx/citation/,7spjx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7spjx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n7dj9/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7spjx/relationships/node/,n7dj9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7spjx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/57bcc5839ad5a101fa68d552/,57bcc5839ad5a101fa68d552,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7spjx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7spjx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7spjx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7spjx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7spjx
