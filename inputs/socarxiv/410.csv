Preparing Australian education for the 2020s and beyond,"This short paper reflects on some pressing issues that Australian education is set to face over the next decade. In particular, we will explore a series of substantial challenges that are likely to come to the fore during the 2020s. These include:
* making a persuasive case for retaining traditional models of ‘school’ and ‘teacher’ in the face of compelling alternatives
* develop broader notions of ‘skills’, ‘competencies’ and ‘aptitudes’ that help students to flourish in an age of precarious employment, misinformation and an increasingly fragmented society
* engaging with digital technology in ways that strengthen the character and values of public education
* renegotiating relationships between educational institutions and the corporate actors that are shaping education agendas around the world
* engaging with public opinion, and fostering a genuine public understanding of (and support for) education
* re-imagining educational provision and practices that are appropriate for an age of climate change.
While these are all incredibly complex challenges, there is good reason to remain hopeful. In this spirit, the paper considers a variety of ways in which the Australian educational community might move forward in a realistic manner – allowing us to play a proactive part in how the 21st century continues to unfold.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-02T12:06:03.727308,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-02T12:05:35.274287,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ryt93/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ryt93/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ryt93/citation/,ryt93,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ryt93/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ryt93/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ryt93/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d43b43e90489f001a48c619/,5d43b43e90489f001a48c619,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ryt93/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ryt93/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ryt93/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ryt93/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ryt93,NA

The purpose of this article is to revisit three assumptions on the two main social policy options for the provision of social benefits to older persons. Each assumption is assessed through counterfactual reasoning using a combination of literature review and statistical analysis with a global perspective. The study finds that (i) 79 countries would be economically able to shift from targeted noncontributory pensions to basic universal noncontributory pensions with less than 1.2 per cent of the respective national gross domestic products; (ii) 16 countries have means‐tested/region‐tested noncontributory pensions more expensive than a hypothetical basic universal social pension; (iii) an arbitrary threshold of “economic development” is not a limitation for implementing social pensions; and (iv) at least 17 countries with relatively low economic development have successfully implemented social pensions without means targeting. Therefore, contrary to what several international organizations and scholars have argued, universal social pensions are politically and economically viable and efficient strategies to alleviate income poverty.",TRUE,FALSE,cash transfers|development|social assitance|social policy|social protection,2019-08-02T02:22:25.052683,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-02T02:21:58.703883,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9uk6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9uk6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9uk6/citation/,y9uk6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9uk6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9uk6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u687n/,u687n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9uk6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d42ff2abcd6d900198dd00b/,5d42ff2abcd6d900198dd00b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9uk6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9uk6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9uk6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y9uk6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y9uk6,https://doi.org/10.1002/pop4.243

This paper is an attempt to recollect previous research and construct a parallel of psychoanalytic concepts and neuroscientific findings such as the correspondence between drive and libido and the dopaminergic seeking system. We are mind, body and language.
In our research we present the hypothesis that there are three existing paths of obtaining certain level of satisfaction – pleasure, jouissance and death drive, led by the pleasure principle of partial satisfaction and the Nirvana principle of (impossible) complete satisfaction.
In Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud reviews his own drive theory incorporating a new term - death drive. Freud theorized about compulsion repetition, a cycle in which a behavior is carried out repeatedly and repressed material is lived instead of remembered, let alone elaborated. He observes that some are not guided by the principle of pleasure seeking, which reveals a complacency of the subject with the suffering of his symptoms, beyond their conscious yearning for healing. While the goal of the life drives is self-preservation, sexual satisfaction, creation and procreation, the final goal of the death drive appears to be to completely reduce tensions and return the living individual to the inorganic state of stillness and repose which is unachievable.
When Jacques Lacan introduces the concept of jouissance (enjoyment), he refers to this mythical state of complete satisfaction before the barrier of the castration as such.
The way to achieve this state of minimum tension, can as well be mediated by addiction and/or compulsive behavior as we have seen before, suppressing the internal tension of stimulus and surrendering to the principle of Nirvana and the death drives – complete reduction of any tension.
Now we know that the frontal cortex is responsible for regulating the instinctual reactions and puts them in social context. But when one appears to be struggling to achieve satisfaction by harmful or unpleasant actions this can be common consequence of the dopaminergic reward functions, resulting in a paradoxically dysfunctional behavior. Repetition is an important brain function. Repetition is involved in learning processes and improves performance. In this theoretical research we would like to review and differentiate between efficient, rewarding repetition and repetition compulsion in order to further clarify how satisfaction can be achieved and up to what point.",TRUE,FALSE,Death drive|Freud|Lacan|Neuropsychoanalysis|Nirvana principle|Psychoanalysis|Satisfaction,2019-08-02T12:05:25.292714,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-02T12:04:40.978015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf9|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Mind|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Mila Petkova PhD,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgrvb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgrvb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgrvb/citation/,xgrvb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgrvb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgrvb/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9esr7/,9esr7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgrvb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d42eae226ebf5001b875287/,5d42eae226ebf5001b875287,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgrvb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgrvb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgrvb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xgrvb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xgrvb,NA

He urged his disciples (those he had already made his followers) as he was about leaving the world to go into the world and make disciples of all nations, ordering them to ""Baptize them, In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"" ( Matt 28:19).  This admonition coupled with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, vivified the disciples in their missionary enterprise to the extent that Christianity embraced various nations with their various cultures and natural inclinations.  In Acts 15:1-35 the meeting of different cultures brought about controversy which nearly rocked the Gentile mission and indeed the entire missionary enterprise.  Peaceful  resolution of the misunderstanding brought about proper definition of what Christianity is all about (which is salvation by faith in Jesus Christ) and subsequent universal development of the church.  It was as a result of the harmonious resolution of that controversy that made both the Jews and Gentles to feel welcomed in the one family of Christ hence the innumerable number of Christians today. In our society today, integrated development is hindered because of various unresolved controversies.  This article aims at identifying the reason why there is no integral development in very many societies and organizations and proffering solution to that effect. It argues that if the leaders of various organizations and societies were to understand properly the actions of the apostles, elders and the church  in Acts 15:1-35 and imbibe it, then integral development would be assured.

And, from an epidemiological vantage there is substantive research examining how social traits of neighbourhoods affect health. However, this research has often focused on the effects of social deprivation. Less attention has been given to social fragmentation (SF), a construct aligned with the notions of lesser: social cohesion, social capital, collective functioning, and social isolation. Concurrently, there has been limited research that has described the spatial and temporal patterning of neighbourhood-level social traits. With a focus on SF the main aims of this paper were to model and describe the time-varying and spatial nature of SF.
Conceptually, this research was informed by ‘thinking in time’ and by the ‘lifecourse-of-place’ perspective. While, from an analytical perspective, a longitudinal (3-time points over 10-years) neighbourhood database was created for the metropolitan region of Adelaide, Australia. Latent Transition Analysis was then used to model the developmental profile of SF where neighbourhoods were proxied by ‘suburbs’, and the measurement model for SF was formed of 9-conceptually related census-based indicators.

Meanwhile, parallel concerns about surveillance practices have already led to multiple successful regulatory efforts of surveillance technologies—many of which have algorithmic components. Here, we examine municipal surveillance regulation as offering lessons for algorithmic oversight. Taking the 2017 Seattle Surveillance Ordinance as our primary case study and surveying efforts across five other cities, we describe the features of existing surveillance regulation; including procedures for describing surveillance technologies in detail, processes for public engagement, and processes for establishing acceptable uses. Although these surveillance-focused laws were not intended to address algorithmic accountability, we find these considerations to be relevant to the law’s aim of surfacing disparate impacts of systems in use. We also find that in notable cases, government employees did not identify regulated algorithmic surveillance technologies as reliant on algorithmic or machine learning systems, highlighting a definitional gap that could hinder future efforts toward algorithmic regulation. We argue that (i) finer-grained distinctions between types of analytic and information systems in the language of law and policy, and (ii) risk assessment tools integrated into their implementation would both strengthen future regulatory efforts by rendering underlying algorithmic components more legible and accountable to political and community stakeholders.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-07-31T21:00:20.880820,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-31T20:59:57.907488,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",Meg Young|Michael Katell|P.

Prior literature highlights the importance of environmental conditions, economic defensibility, and wealth transmission for shaping early Holocene origins of social inequality. However, it remains untested whether the mechanisms that drive the evolution of inequality in recent human societies follow a similar trajectory. We conduct the first global analysis of pathways to inequality within modern human societies using structural equation modeling. Our analytical approach demonstrates that environmental conditions, resource intensification, and wealth transmission mechanisms impact various forms of social inequality via a complex web of causality. We further find that subsistence practices have a direct impact on some institutionalized forms of inequality. This work identifies drivers of social inequality in the modern world and demonstrates the application of structural equation modeling methods to investigate complex relationships between elements of human culture.",TRUE,FALSE,,2019-08-02T02:14:03.327190,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-02T02:13:37.721728,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzv8d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzv8d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzv8d/citation/,nzv8d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzv8d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzv8d/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hmwv5/,hmwv5,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzv8d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d41c9aa26ebf500198550e6/,5d41c9aa26ebf500198550e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzv8d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzv8d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nzv8d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nzv8d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nzv8d,NA
