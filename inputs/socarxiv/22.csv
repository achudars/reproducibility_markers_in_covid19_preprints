This study utilizes longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) to assess whether fathers’ time off work after the birth of a child reduces the likelihood of parents dissolving their relationship. We also consider whether the association between fathers’ time off work and relationship dissolution is mediated by fathers’ support of mothers and moderated by union type. Results indicate that the risk of relationship dissolution is lower when fathers take time off work after the birth of a child. Results also suggest that longer periods of time off work (i.e., two or more weeks) are associated with a lower risk of relationship dissolution among married couples, although overall evidence for variations by union type are mixed. Additionally, there is evidence that the association between fathers’ time off work and relationship dissolution is at least partially explained by higher levels of relationship support among fathers who took time off work after the birth of a child. Overall, findings suggest that providing fathers with opportunities to take time off for the birth of a child may help to promote relationship stability among socioeconomically disadvantaged couples in the U.S.",TRUE,FALSE,,2021-04-28T11:54:52.645993,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-28T11:21:19.440586,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eyd9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eyd9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eyd9/citation/,2eyd9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eyd9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eyd9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eyd9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6087ed497166fa0185e8cfc9/,6087ed497166fa0185e8cfc9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eyd9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eyd9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2eyd9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2eyd9/,https://doi.org/10.1080/00380237.2021.1921641,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2eyd9

Current frameworks are unable to provide comprehensive answers to this important question. Existing studies tend to operationalize antisemitism too narrowly, using a single indicator of the phenomenon. Moreover, their scope tends to be restricted to a specific national or ideological context. The resulting nearsightedness fails to capture the conceptual breadth of antisemitism and precludes discovery of cross-national patterns and trends over time, which in turn hinders development of testable hypotheses about why antisemitism varies across space and time. To advance the study of antisemitism empirically and theoretically, this article proposes a new analytical framework composed of three key indicators: antisemitic attitudes, incidents targeting Jews, and Jews' exposure to antisemitism. Reviewing extant data on these indicators, the article finds that: (1) attitudes vary considerably by geographic and cultural region as well as among population sub-groups; (2) current incident data do not enable cross-national comparison, but global incident levels have fluctuated on a relatively high level after 2000; and (3) Jews’ exposure to antisemitism appears relatively high and stable over the past decade, with some notable temporal and spatial variation, and is not tied to levels of antisemitic attitudes in the way one might expect. Employing the three-dimensional framework enables the formation of a more accurate and nuanced picture of how antisemitism is developing, and helps identify unresolved questions and hypotheses to guide future research. A similar three-dimensional framework could be fruitfully applied in the study of other forms of racism and prejudice.",TRUE,FALSE,analytical framework|antisemitic attitudes|antisemitic incidents|antisemitism|anti-Semitism|cross-national data|exposure|hate crime|Jews|middle-range theory|prejudice,2021-04-28T11:56:42.681964,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-28T11:21:46.246558,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/m4yba/,no,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76ca8|Arts and Humanities|Jewish Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adqkn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adqkn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adqkn/citation/,adqkn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adqkn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adqkn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/m4yba/,m4yba,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adqkn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6087b70ef16160018d9cc6e6/,6087b70ef16160018d9cc6e6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adqkn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adqkn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adqkn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/adqkn/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/adqkn

Results reveal that information about social responsibility initiatives does not attract significant visual attention from tourists, especially when they are confronted with a typically large amount of information about accommodation options.

With no legal allowances for medical or recreational use of marijuana, Nebraska has become an outlier in maintaining a complete prohibition on the substance. We examine overall public support for medical and recreational marijuana in the state of Nebraska, as well as support by intrastate region, political party, and the association between stigma and legal support.

Methods - We use data from the 2020 Nebraska Annual Social Indicators Survey (NASIS) which is paper survey mailed to an address-based sample of Nebraskans who are 19 and older. The 2020 NASIS was mailed to 8,000 addresses in Nebraska using a stratified sampling design. Using a question developed by Pew Research Center we ask if participants support legal marijuana for medical AND recreational use, medical use only, or if they think it should not be legal. 

Results – We estimate that 83% of Nebraskans support medical marijuana legalization, a clear majority of opinion. Support is more divided between whether the substance should be legal for both medical and recreational use, or just for medical use. There are also associations between support preferences and age, political party, gender, and the amount of stigma a participant reports in their community towards people that use various substances.

Conclusion – A small percent of the Nebraska population are estimated to favor keeping marijuana illegal.

Older and more politically conservative individuals were consistently less supportive of paid parental leave availability, longer lengths of leave, and government funding of leave. Women, supporters of dual-earner expectations, black individuals, and those who were not working in paid labor were typically more supportive of generous paid parental leave offerings.

This research proposes a method for analyzing climate change technology transfer using patent analysis and topic modeling. A collection of climate change patent data from patent databases would be used as input to group patents in several relevant topics for climate change mitigation using the topic exploration model in this research. The research questions we want to address are: how have patenting activities changed over time in climate change mitigation related technology (CCMT) patents? And who are the technological leaders? The investigation of these questions can offer the technological landscape in climate change-related technologies at the international level. We propose a hybrid Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach for topic modelling and identification of relationships between terms and topics related to CCMT, enabling better visualizations of underlying intellectual property dynamics.

Several attempts have been made to answer this question, with a family of models emerging as a result. However, empirically evaluating neighbourhood evolution models is a challenging task, because most require information that is difficult to obtain in traditional sources. For this reason, researchers have turned to new datasets, such as census microdata, Twitter, and Yelp. In this study, we articulate a functional model of neighbourhood change and continuity, adapted from a classical functionalist model proposed by Stinchcombe in 1968. We argue this model provides a relatively simple way to capture key aspects of the complex causal structure of neighbourhood change that are implicit in much neighbourhood change research but rarely formulated explicitly. We demonstrate how to assess the proposed model empirically using large-scale data from Yelp.com. Our results indicate that our approach can potentially help to understand the nature of neighbourhood change and be useful in different applications.",TRUE,FALSE,Functional Model|Neighbourhood Change|Yelp Data,2021-04-27T08:05:02.302074,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-27T07:59:28.016433,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.yelp.com/dataset/,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wprf8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wprf8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wprf8/citation/,wprf8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wprf8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wprf8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wprf8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60873262f16160015f9cec32/,60873262f16160015f9cec32,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wprf8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wprf8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wprf8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wprf8/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wprf8

Each turning point was triggered by an event or series of events that profoundly altered the international environment of Vietnam’s quest for identity, resources, and security. These events exerted enormous impact not only on the conditions under which the country operates but also on Vietnamese views of the world and the key actors in their international environment. When Vietnam’s ruling elites responded to these changes, they set in motion corresponding changes in Vietnamese domestic and foreign policy. The foreign policy periods bracketed by the turning points thus roughly corresponded with phases in the evolution of the Vietnamese state. This paper will tease out the complex relationships between the international environment, the nature of the Vietnamese state, and Vietnamese foreign policy, and shed light on the worldviews and motives behind Vietnam’s foreign policy. 

The key challenge to current Vietnamese foreign policy, which was also its main shortcoming in the last three decades, is that Vietnam’s policymakers often view the world through the prism of a bygone era. The last section of the paper will briefly scan the horizon for the next turning point in Vietnamese foreign policy.",TRUE,FALSE,ASEAN|China-Vietnam Relations|Strategic Partnerships|US-Vietnam Relations|Vietnam|Vietnamese Foreign Policy|Vietnamese Politics|Vietnamese state|Worldview,2021-04-27T08:03:47.902104,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-27T07:58:43.821860,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,,not_applicable,NA,,,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|Arts and Humanities|History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d93|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqzhf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqzhf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqzhf/citation/,nqzhf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqzhf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqzhf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqzhf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60870449f1616001489cc403/,60870449f1616001489cc403,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqzhf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqzhf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nqzhf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nqzhf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nqzhf
