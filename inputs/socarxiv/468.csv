Exceeding previous research, we study the evolution over time of social gaps in achievement from birth to adolescence in Germany. Our theoretical framework juxtaposes two sets of compensation and polarization mechanisms which shape the overall extent of social inequality in learning as children navigate through early years and school. For Germany, with the most stratified education system in the Western world, our theoretical considerations predict that achievement gaps will be particularly magnified during tracked secondary schooling. We exploit data from 57 competence tests taken from age of 7 months to 16 years by the National Educational Panel Study. Composite skill measures and domain-specific skills were analyzed. Our findings point to striking socio-economic status (SES) gaps in skills which emerge and expand long before children enter school but then remain astoundingly stable throughout their school careers. We tentatively conclude that schooling decreases social inequality in learning. Our study adds to an emerging body of longitudinal research concerned with the evolution of inequality of educational opportunity in the early life course.",TRUE,FALSE,achievement gaps|inequality of educational opportunity|longitudinal research|role of schooling,2018-10-01T13:10:41.638853,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-10-01T13:10:14.972784,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,Jan Skopek|Giampiero Passaretta,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkctv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkctv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkctv/citation/,xkctv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkctv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3m7yk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkctv/relationships/node/,3m7yk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkctv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bb209c9118e1200181974c2/,5bb209c9118e1200181974c2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkctv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkctv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xkctv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xkctv/,https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaa093,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xkctv

We show that growing attention to new macroeconomic research was a reaction to both mounting external criticisms against the Fed’s decision-making process and a process internal to the discipline whereby institutionalism was displaced by neoclassical theory and econometrics. We argue that the rise of the number of PhD economists working at the Fed is a symptom rather than a cause of this transformation. 

Key to our story are a handful of economists from the Board of Governor’s Division of Research and Statistics (DRS) who paradoxically did not always held a PhD, but envisioned their role as going beyond mere data accumulation and got involved into large-scale macroeconometric model building. We conclude that the divide between PhD and non-PhD economists may not be fully relevant to understand both the shift in the type of economics practiced at the Fed and the uses of this knowledge in the decision making-process.

The streets of the nation’s capital have been flooded with people marching about a diversity of progressive issues including women’s rights, climate change, and gun violence.  Although research has found that these events have mobilized a high proportion of repeat participants who come out again-and-again, limited research has focused on understanding differential participation in protest, especially during one cycle of contention.  This paper, accordingly, explores the patterns among the protest participants to understand differential participation and what explains persistence in the Resistance.  In it, we analyze a unique dataset collected from surveys conducted with a random sample of protest participant at the largest protest events in Washington, DC since the inauguration of Donald Trump.

This paper draws on key insights from studies of the interdisciplinary process and proposes the Sharing Meanings Approach for improving interdisciplinary collaboration in hazards research. The Sharing Meanings Approach addresses common challenges to interdisciplinary teamwork and organizes them into four focal areas: (1) worldviews (including ontological, epistemological, and philosophical perspectives), (2) language, (3) research design, and (4) project goals. The approach emphasizes the process of sharing rather than seeking to develop a single set of shared meanings related to the four focal areas. The paper identifies common challenges and recommends strategies and actions within each focal area for guiding teams toward sharing their implicit meanings. A hypothetical example is introduced to demonstrate how the approach offers a path for revealing and overcoming the common roadblocks experienced in interdisciplinary hazards research. By making interdisciplinary hazards teams’ implicit assumptions explicit, the Sharing Meanings Approach offers an operational process to seize on moments of difference as productive tension and to see such challenges as opportunities—rather than obstacles—for innovating toward hybrid methodological research designs in hazards research.",TRUE,FALSE,disasters|epistemology|hazards|interdisciplinary|Sharing Meanings Approach,2018-09-28T22:14:21.545936,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-28T22:13:31.668433,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Physical and Environmental Geography,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/citation/,hnf8y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nd5tk/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/relationships/node/,nd5tk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5baea20f71746000164de99f/,5baea20f71746000164de99f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hnf8y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hnf8y/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hnf8y

We find that transitive structures hinder dyadic coordination at the start, in particular for groups consisting of strangers. Our findings suggest that the coordination difficulties in transitive triads may be explained by the difficulty to establish a behavioral common ground due to the asymmetry of such structure. These coordination problems are transient - groups of different structures end up with the same average communication performance if given sufficient time.

Background: Most countries have mandatory separation periods that couples undergo before they can divorce. Separation allows couples a grace-period, during which they may reconcile and stay together. Yet, the impact of separation periods on divorce risk remains understudied. 
Methods: Using monthly time series data on divorce rates from 2007-2018 (T=144), the research brief estimates the size and shape of the policy impact of the July 2013 reform. Using monthly administrative population data on all ever-married couples (N*T=40,431,848) the study further calculates the average characteristics of married couples in Denmark who would have remained together absent the reform.
Results: After an initial spike in the divorce rate driven by couples divorcing earlier, the divorce rate settled at a 9.7 percent higher level compared to pre-reform. Couples who divorced because of the reform had been married for fewer years, were ethnic Danish, and had high school degree as highest educational level.

The predominance of NHST in communication research is in spite of serious concerns about the ability of researchers to properly interpret its results. We draw on data from a survey of the ICA membership to assess the evidential basis of these concerns.

However, mobility declines among graduate-degree holders. This finding questions the meritocratic power of higher education. Prior research has been hampered, however, by the small samples of advanced degree holders in representative surveys. Drawing on a large longitudinal dataset of PhD holders –the Survey of Doctorate Recipients– this study examines intergenerational mobility among the American educational elite, separately for men and women and different racial/ethnic groups. Results show substantial mobility among PhD holders. The association between parents’ education and adult children’s earnings is moderate among men and non-existent among women with doctoral degrees. However, women’s earnings converge to an average level that is much lower than men’s, signaling “perverse openness” for women even at the top of the educational distribution. Among men, there is variation in mobility by race and ethnicity. The intergenerational socioeconomic association is null for Asian men, small for white and black men, and more pronounced for Hispanics. Educational and occupational mediators account for intergenerational association among blacks and whites but not Hispanic men. A doctoral degree largely detaches individuals from their social origins in the United States but it does not eliminate all sources of inequality",TRUE,FALSE,class inequality|graduate education|higher education|intergenerational mobility|meritocracy,2018-09-26T17:11:25.316809,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-26T16:58:44.989366,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvmde/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvmde/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvmde/citation/,gvmde,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvmde/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q4nfx/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvmde/relationships/node/,q4nfx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvmde/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5bababb571746000154b0766/,5bababb571746000154b0766,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvmde/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvmde/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvmde/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gvmde/,https://doi.org/10.1177/0038040718801812,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gvmde

It intends to approach several interdisciplinary concepts for the incorporation of critical discourse analysis, a relatively recent theoretical and practical approach of discourse analysis based on critical theory, critical linguistics and discourse analysis into history. It centers its focus on the consideration of discourse as an event, a socio-cultural expression conditioned by social structures and belief systems of groups of power acting upon others and conditioning the social context while being the transmitter of ideology. It presents social practices in parallel to discursive ones thereby creating a dialectal relationship between them. The relations of power, hegemony, dominance, and especially, ideology, are the main concerns of critical discourse analysis thereby making room for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary joint efforts to research: psychology, sociology, politics, economics, and education, among a few others are related to history in order to describe, interpret and explain the historical relationships between society and language.",TRUE,FALSE,Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)|goals|Higher Education|mision|public universities|recontextualization|vision,2018-09-27T20:37:25.034683,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2018-09-27T20:36:58.634115,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education,,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/458cf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/458cf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/458cf/citation/,458cf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/458cf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ze2yn/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/458cf/relationships/node/,ze2yn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/458cf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5baba10dd40256001a2944d9/,5baba10dd40256001a2944d9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/458cf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/458cf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/458cf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/458cf/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/458cf
