We begin by outlining the primary principles of sampling and measurement design, then describing how those combine into what is labeled as the “boundary specification problem” for social network research. We accompany these definitions with examples of how these elements are applied across ego-, partial- and complete- network designs. Next, the chapter turns to the primary ways that network data have been evaluated, highlighting both the implications of those evaluations for their use in network analyses, and various strategies for how the identified limitations can be leveraged for optimal data and analytic quality. The chapter concludes by addressing some of the ethical considerations that are unique to the gathering and analyses of social network data.",TRUE,FALSE,data collection|data quality|ethics|research design|social network analysis,2019-03-18T02:57:41.470840,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-18T02:57:17.473650,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgawf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgawf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgawf/citation/,zgawf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgawf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgawf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgawf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8eeb9180f5d2001785c21d/,5c8eeb9180f5d2001785c21d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgawf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgawf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgawf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zgawf/,https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190251765.013.10,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zgawf

Numbers revealing a gender gap in research are periodically reported by national and international institutions but data on perceptions of gender equality within the research community are scarce. In the present study, a questionnaire based on the British Athena Survey of Science, Engineering and Technology (ASSET 2016) was distributed among researchers working in Spain. Consistent with the original UK-based study, women in research perceived a greater degree of gender inequality than men. This difference was consistent from junior to senior positions, within public and private universities as well as research centres, and across all research disciplines. When responses were compared with the existing UK-based questionnaire, researchers in Spain felt that women and men are treated more equally in the workplace, yet they perceived their home departments to be less supportive regarding matters of gender equality. The results of this study provide clear evidence that men and women do not share the same perceptions of gender equality in science and that their differing perceptions are relatively consistent across two major European countries. The fact that men occupy the majority of senior positions while not perceiving the same inequality as women do, may be critical when it comes to ensuring the fair ascent of women to senior positions in an academic system.

We challenge Garrison’s assertions that non-binary individuals reproduce the gender binary in that they are more likely than binary trans individuals to use essentialist narratives to construct their gender identity. Due to Garrison’s criteria for participation in his study, all participants identified as trans and were in the process of transitioning. However, not all non-binary individuals identify as trans and consequently Garrison’s theorizing from a small sample of trans identified non-binary folks is problematic. We argue that the small sample size and Garrison’s recruitment strategy do not capture the wide range of individuals who identify as non-binary and that this small sample is not enough for Garrison to generalize about non-binary identified folks. Gender identity is a complex issue and while we commend Garrison for his contribution to the field, we argue that such work should be done with diligence as to ensure that research does not render identities invisible in early attempts to theorize with small samples.",TRUE,FALSE,accountability|gender|gender essentialism|genderqueer|gender social structure|non-binary|trans|transgender,2019-03-17T21:00:03.480496,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-17T20:59:35.746856,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/citation/,4usqt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8ea39a80f5d2001883d249/,5c8ea39a80f5d2001883d249,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4usqt/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4usqt

A Field Study Examining Religiosity and Social Capital in Tunisia,"The present study sheds light upon critical factors that help explain the entrepreneurial success among Muslim women living in a democratic Tunisia, a Muslim-majority country considered by many to be the lone Arab Spring success story. We hypothesized that successful entrepreneurs need social capital, including the capital that comes from marriage and high levels of wasta (the Arabic concept of having personal connections with influential others). Moreover, given the lack of empirical attention paid to the role of the culture, language, and customs associated with Islam on women’s empowerment, we examine whether religiosity is related to entrepreneurial performance among Tunisian women. Data collected with 84 female entrepreneurs participating in entrepreneurship training programs across Tunisia reveal that two forms of social capital, marital status and wasta, are related to training center directors’ ratings of women entrepreneurs’ performance, suggesting that social capital is a critical asset for Muslim women entrepreneurs. Religiosity, on the other hand, had no statistically significant relationship with entrepreneurial performance. Our study contributes to research on entrepreneurship by identifying wasta as a form of social capital that may be necessary for women entrepreneurs to succeed in the Middle East and North Africa and by taking an initial step towards better understanding the empirical (and controversial) relationship between religiosity and career success among Muslim women. We recommend that training organizations supporting entrepreneurs directly assist women in the development of social capital and acknowledge, rather than ignore, that nepotism and wasta are linked to entrepreneurial success in some cultures.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab world|entrepreneurs|human capital|Islam|marital status|religiosity|self-employment|social capital|spirituality|Tunisia|wasta,2019-03-16T20:13:49.639382,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-16T20:13:23.176080,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology,Lisa Baranik|Brandon Gorman|and William J.

This paper uses qualitative interviews to understand the process by which graduates of elite colleges decide where to live following graduation. It shows that many graduates are indifferent about exactly where they live, and find themselves funneled towards certain cities based on geographically uneven access to two key types of information. Facilitative information eases the job search process, enabling graduates to find and obtain opportunities they want, while formative information helps them determine what they want in the first place.  Graduates’ position in social structure—in particular their past experiences and personal networks—affects their exposure to both types of information in ways that strongly influence where they end up and on occasion even overcome their stated location preferences.

The present paper builds from this growing literature in its analysis of the formation of National Public Radio (NPR), to better understand how organizational actors translate racialized practices into new organizations at their foundation, even when they seek greater racial inclusivity. I coin a new analytical concept, white institutional isomorphism, to analyze how organizations that embrace a mission of diversity may end up reproducing racially exclusionary practices. White institutional isomorphic pressures are racialized norms that shape the standards and practices adopted across organizations within a given field. Using organizational meeting minutes, external reports, oral histories, and founder memoirs, I show that early implementation of station membership criteria, hiring practices, and programming priorities, while considered race-neutral decisions by the founders that shared a white habitus, inhibited the inclusion of nonwhite voices into NPR’s workforce, station membership, and programming.",TRUE,FALSE,diversity|organizations|race|radio|whiteness,2019-03-16T15:41:45.108558,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-16T15:41:24.320705,FALSE,NA,no,"National Public Broadcasting Archives, College Park, Maryland",,no,NA,,,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Laura Garbes,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/citation/,tj5cs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8d0c65075b640019a3be05/,5c8d0c65075b640019a3be05,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tj5cs/,NA,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tj5cs

Amidst the chaos, analysts were expected to provide stakeholders with impact estimates immediately following the hurricane. Unfortunately, this strong need for fast information after the disaster coincided with limited options for high-quality data sources to help stakeholders address challenges such as resource allocation and bond-pricing. Given the stabilization of data sources since the hurricanes, this paper examines historical demographic and economic data to give a long-term view of population change in Puerto Rico. First, we juxtapose population, employment, hurricanes and significant economic events to make the argument that the clearest driver of population decline in Puerto Rico is simply the economic health of the island (i.e. employment). Second, we focus on Pre- and Post-Hurricane Irma/Maria migration estimates to highlight the spike in outmigration following the hurricanes, as well as the, return immigration in the first half of the first half of 2018. Finally, we study historical net outmigration and employment trends to illustrate the short-lived outmigration impacts of hurricanes while also highlighting the long-term outmigration impacts of economic downturns. In short, we argue that the primary reason people are leaving Puerto Rico is the struggling economy and not hurricane-related destruction. The hurricanes simply exacerbated the economic-related outmigration trends and we believe that any serious plans for Puerto Rico’s restoration must include special attention to stimulate the economy.",TRUE,FALSE,Economy|Employment|Hurricane Maria|Population|Puerto Rico,2019-03-15T21:51:06.931490,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T21:36:03.327899,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/citation/,3frzu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8c03f1075b640019a2deb8/,5c8c03f1075b640019a2deb8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3frzu/,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11111-020-00355-5,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3frzu

A Study of Satisfaction with the Work–Family Balance among Part-Time Service Sector Employees in Five Western European Countries,"Working part-time is frequently considered a viable strategy for employees to better combine work and non-work responsibilities. The present study examines differences in satisfaction with work-family balance (SWFB) among professional and non-professional part-time service sector employees in five western European countries. Part-time employees were found to be more SWFB than full-time employees even after taking varying demands and resources into account. However, there are important differences among the part-timers. Employees in marginal part-time employment with considerably reduced working hours were the most satisfied. Professionals were found to profit less from reduced working hours and experienced lower levels of SWFB than non-professionals. No significant differences in SWFB were found between male and female part-time workers.",TRUE,FALSE,Europe|gender|part-time work|professionals|satisfaction with work-family balance,2019-03-15T21:48:41.971086,NA,,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15T21:35:10.282525,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",The authors,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wak9y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wak9y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wak9y/citation/,wak9y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wak9y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wak9y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wak9y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8c0072075b64001ba22119/,5c8c0072075b64001ba22119,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wak9y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wak9y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wak9y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wak9y/,https://doi.org/10.1080/09585192.2012.654808,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wak9y
